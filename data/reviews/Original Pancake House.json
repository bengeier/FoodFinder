{"text":"Original Pancake is one of the best breakfast places ever.  They are a chain, and their locations in Rancho Santa Fe (SD), Palm Desert, Chicago, etc are all way more charming than this one.  That said, breakfast here is always consistently delicious and the service is great.  Their omelettes are fluffy and baked with the ingredients inside, almost like a souflee.  They do a great dutch baby, german apple pancake, and a dutch garden (dutch baby topped with veggies and cheese).  Their pancakes are my favorite- thin and flavorful, you can smell the buttermilk.  They come in every flavor, including seasonal pumpkin (amazing!) and fresh strawberry with whipped cream (during summer months, with fresh not canned whipped cream).  They also have classics like eggs benedict, corned beef hash, and amazing swedish pancakes (thin like crepes).  They also have a location in GVR that is newly expanded, for people on the Henderson side of town."}
{"text":"I have to say it's worth the wait.  I showed up and had to wait 20 mins. for breakfast on a Sunday (which really isnt bad).  OPH does a good job moving people in and out.  I had the corned beef hash and it was great.  I was very pleased to find out that it's homemade and NOT canned.  Needless to say the taste was out of this world.  There was so many choices I need to to keep going back.  Next on the list: crepes.  Wonderful place - excellent quality food and kind staff."}
{"text":"Read the other reviews, and I agree with all of them. I've had good and bad meals there, BUT it is the only place for an Apple pancake. Don't order anything else. Skip the extras and REMEMBER to bring cash."}
{"text":"Alright, so I may be biased but this has been my favorite place to eat for at least the past 20 years of my life.  I used to travel full time for my job so I've been to several locations across the country; Chicago, Southfield (MI) Toledo, San Diego, Dallas, Atlanta, Aventura (FL), Ft. Lauderdale, Miami, Jacksonville and my hands down favorite Boca Raton!    I've been ordering the same thing for all these years, bacon and eggs with pancakes.  Now these pancakes aren't your ordinary tasting pancakes.  They melt in your mouth and every time you take a bite a slight moan of delight escapes your lips.    Although the portion sizes may vary from one location to the next (The Boca Raton location is my fav because the pancakes were the size of a large plate!) but the pancakes always taste the same.  The prices are a bit higher than typical breakfast spots like IHOP and Denny's but trust me it's well worth it.  Hey, don't take my word, try it for yourself and you will definitely become a believer.  You won't look at any other pancake the same!"}
{"text":"Like Clay P who posted before me, I too love pancakes. Though I love chocolate chip pancakes. But like Clay I did not love the ones that I got a the Original Pancake House. Typically, restaurants just don't do it the way I like them and I have come to expect that. Grading OPH on those terms, they did a respectable job. It is definitely a worthwhile destination for a pancake lover."}
{"text":"Come here every time I am in Las Vegas, always have a great meal.  Sometimes there a wait but never too long.  Service is great or has been every time we have come.  The potato pancakes are always a hit.  Going there this A.M for my birthday breakfast!  Try it , I think you will not be disappointed.  D from so cal"}
{"text":"Lots of variety and the food is good. There can be a waiting list, but it typically moves pretty quick so don't be discouraged if you see a line if people outside."}
{"text":"Bacon is the perfect crispy. Had the blueberry pancakes. Coffee was good. Fast service! Would come back"}
{"text":"I a fan of all the pancakes they have.  Strawberry and whipped cream, blueberry, and banana.  The strawberry is a huge starwberries on top of huge flat pancakes with strawberrry syrup.  I also had a side of hash browns and egg combinations.  The coffee isn't the best so I never ordered it twice,  The waitresses aren't the sexiest but they bring food to the table and listen to what you order.  They make sure to bring you butter and maple syrup. I haven't been to the River Road location but I might try and come back to give you my thoughts.  How are their  waitresses you ask?"}
{"text":"D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S Crepes. If you go here and you are a crepe fan I would say they have the best crepes out of other breakfast joints I have tried. If your not a crepe fan they do have lots of other items. Their omelets are good too (big portion so share with someone). Pancakes are delicious and fluffy, especially their blueberry ones. You know how come places have just the sauce of blueberry which kind of overpowers the enjoyment of a pancake, well their pancakes are not like that. They put the blueberries in their batter, the way I like it."}
{"text":"After going here for years, boy were we disappointed. It's like no one cared any more. For 6 of us, we got 2 menus, no kids menu, the table was dirty, we had to find our own flatware, and no coffee. Even though it wasn't filled, it took 20 minutes to get our order taken, and another 20 for it to come. The manager couldn't have cared less. We had to go into the kitchen to get ketchup. No refills on coffee, and the food was nowhere as good as  previously. This  place was always our favorite, but no longer.  It will be a long time before we consider another visit. There are plenty of other breakfast places to choose from."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast joint in Champaign (and Urbana).  If it was possible to give it 4.5 stars I would b/c the price is a bit on the high side but I think the quality of the food makes it worthwhile.   They have the best pancakes in town and the coffee is great.   The bacon is thick and not too fatty (if that is possible for bacon) another personal favorite.  This is our regular stop on Friday mornings with our kids, 2 and 4 year old.  They have crayons and paper for the kids and the wait staff has always been great with them. It can have a long wait on weekends so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Best bacon and pancakes and omelets in all Las Vegas .a little expensive but well worth it ."}
{"text":"On 4/15 My girl friend and myself visit this restaurant which was suspose to be a great place. We called ahead to check for closing time because we knew that they only servied breakfast. we were told 2pm. We thought because it was just 11:30 we would try it.   We arrived at a little after 12, we found some of the restaurant had already Ben closed off for the day they did not want to seat us where we wanted to be seated or Service a certain food because it would take too long to cook. The table we were placed at was a very small table and we request a booth, We were actually told by the hostest that they did want to have to clean a table that was already cleaned. I thought that may be the table she was placing us at was not clean and they were not going to clean until after we were finished.  the waitress never came over to Service we had to ask for her to come over.  they were so busy getting ready to go home they neglected (us)the customer. They were ready to close and they let us know it.  We did eat, and when we finished paid our bill which also was over priced and then left with leaving no tip.  The food was a 3, the service was -0. If you are to patronize this place help them out, although they are open until 2 don't go after 12nn  and if you go after 12nn set at the counter then they recognize that you there to help them close on time!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good. For what they charge, yes portions are a bit on the small side. I have been here on two occasions. One time I ordered the silver dollar pancakes which I really enjoyed. The other time, I ordered bacon pancakes which were just ok. The place is clean and they offer a nice looking menu with an array of breakfast items, but the quality of customer service is bad. I don't like going somewhere where I feel like I am being processed through. On my second visit especially, my friend and I had arrived an hour and a half before closing. Now I fully understand that people are tired but when chairs are being stacked and the register is being closed out before the closing time is a bit much, especially when the server and manager kept coming up to our table asking us to hurry up and pay. We had just received our food and had them in our face demanding our money. May come back here, may not."}
{"text":"My husband and I love love this place.  If you are looking for a scene and need to be seen this is not your joint. I've been coming here since I was a little girl and it's always been great.  As for the comments about the service being poor or cold I couldn't disagree more. It might be a bit more like service on the East Coast, efficient and no nonsense, but for how busy they always are that's expected. The food is amazing. Always.   I love the French Crepes. Perfect Crepes with fresh sliced strawberries inside and on top, yummy strawberry syrup and fresh whipping cream!!! With a side of crispy bacon. Amazing meal.  My husband loves the breakfast burrito. It's HUGE. Filled with tons of  goodies- egg, ect and has a green tomatillo sauce on top and melted cheese. It's his favorite breakfast.   Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"This place has best french toast and pancakes ever - with excellent syrup.  Don't miss out on the strawberries with cream in the summer.  Service is extremely fast.  Coffee is very, very strong!  Decor is nothing special.  Not a fancy place but great to run in for a quick stack!"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite breakfast place in the Monona area. Omelets are especially delicious. They're big,  fluffy, and stuffed with delicious meats and veggies."}
{"text":"I love love love this place!  Only open AM & lunch and POOF, it's over!  FABULOUS crepes, pancakes,real waffles!  You will love it!  Service is good & friendly!  This place is PACKED on weekends so come early!"}
{"text":"No credit cards, no cell phones, expensive private ATM, long wait, bad service, and a grouchy old woman that takes your money that I like to call the Check Nazi. Used to be the best pancakes on earth... until Wildflower opened here. Don't bother with this place. I am a 40 year native and eaten everywhere in this town."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast restaurant. The vibe is rustic and cozy. I always order a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice and the Georgia Pecan Pancakes. I don't think I've ever finished my plate here. Portion sizes are huge and leftovers are inevitable. The service could be better. But then again, the place is usually packed, so I understand if servers make mistakes sometimes. All in all, a solid breakfast experience."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! =) I love their Challah French Toast, and their Apple Pancake! The Omelets are to die for also..they are baked in the oven, as opposed to in a frying pan..THE BEST BREAKFAST PLACE EVER! Everything is fresh, and they have tons of locations across the U.S. Please do not even try to compare to IHOP. This place wins by a long shot!"}
{"text":"My family and I love the pancake house. We typically go over the weekends and we  enjoy it. As usual, my family and I loved the food. However the service was horrible. Our waiter, Ana, was unprepared, rude and had to have the last word. When she first came to our table we asked to order and she was obviously thrown off by this. She went to get her notepad, then came back. She then asked for our orders confusing herself as she went. Finally, she went to put in the order. When it arrived she had messed up my order, giving me six pancakes instead of three. I told her that I ordered three and not six pancakes and she claimed that I had ordered six. She then took my plate, went to the back, took off three pancakes and brought my plate back. She also messed up my little sister's order. She omitted my sister's piece of bacon, which was included in the Junior plate that she ordered. After, she simply brought out the check and left. No 'have a nice day' or anything. Very poor service but satisfactory food."}
{"text":"I have mixed opinions about this place.  They have a really long wait on weekends and slow service.  The pancakes & french toast are excellent, but that's not all that makes breakfast for me.  I need some scrambled eggs.  This place has the weirdest tasting scrambled eggs I've ever eaten in my entire life.  I've been there three times and gotten them every time hoping it was just a fluke, but seriously - they are TERRIBLE.  They taste like they mixed melted plastic in with the eggs when scrambling.  Gross.  As a result, I'm hesitant to return because as much as I love their french toast - I can make it at home and have edible eggs."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of eating here twice. Once, because I thought it would be good based on what others had told me, and once because someone else insisted we go. (They were sure it would be a much better experience my second time around.)  Here's a tip for the owner/manager:  Hire wait staff whose first language is ENGLISH or who speak it FLUENTLY Hire wait staff who are friendly and efficient Hire wait staff who act like they really care if I return Hire wait staff who really want me to tip them TAKE CREDIT/DEBIT CARDS; This is 2012, nearly 2013. The IRS must love you because you don't pay taxes on what you actually make. (Cash only means you only report what you want to, not what you actually rake in. How clever)  The bacon, the pancakes, and fresh squeezed orange juice were great. The negatives above don't make it worth the extensive wait for a table. This place is over priced, doesn't take plastic, and the wait staff need a huge improvement.   I'll take IHOP any day of the week over this silly place. You do remember you're in Scottsdale, right?"}
{"text":"I found this little gem last week and could not be more thrilled with my find. I stopped in for breakfast on a Wednesday morning. They weren't super busy and I was able to get a table immediately. An investigation of the menu revealed that they had a large selection to choose from... eggs, omelette, waffles, and pancakes. Their pancake menu in particular is quite extensive (which makes sense considering their name), having at least 10 different pancake flavors to choose from, including the old favorites such as blueberry and strawberry as well as some less common ones like coconut and potato. I decided to try their strawberry pancakes. When they arrived, I could not have been more pleased. The pancakes were light and fluffy and topped with fresh strawberries and, wonder of wonders, homemade whipped cream! They also came with a side of strawberry syrup which tasted like actual strawberries instead of artificial flavoring. Absolutely delicious! The wait staff was also very friendly, and the restaurant had a very homey feel in general. The one thing people should be aware of if they go to eat there is that the restaurant does not accept credit cards, only cash or check."}
{"text":"Great place for pancakes - huge portions and a variety that pleases any taste. I am a fan of the crepes. Very busy always so expect a wait unless you get there early."}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast places.    Make sure to go early to avoid long waits due to the popularity of the restaurant.    The specialty items like Apple Pancake, Dutch Baby, and baked 4 egg omelets plus excellent coffee and friendly service is what sets this place apart from others in town.    This past weekend, they had pumpkin pecan pancakes as a special and were excellent."}
{"text":"Amazing! Wonderfully friendly service, fast wait staff, full cups, and hot food. Our host updated us on our wait time and we were still seated quickly. Our waiter was very patient, willing to answer any of our questions, and all of the food was amazing. Hash brown potatoes so good they didn't need any seasoning or ketchup. Fresh whipped cream, great coffee, and giant omlettes, what more could you want?!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. Parking was impossible. Wait was expected for a Sunday morning. Food was ok. Noise from the kitchen was overwhelming. Could hardly hear each other."}
{"text":"One of the best run operations in Charlotte.  I'm amazed they are so consistent with the food and the service with that type of volume.   Eggs Michael is the best breakfast dish out there, and their crepes, pancakes, and pretty much anything on the menu is delicious!    We eat there a lot, and no one in my family has ever complained."}
{"text":"My family have been eating at this location for years! The prices, the service, and the food are all great!! Best breakfast in town!!!"}
{"text":"Great, fast service. The food is wonderful.  Always packed! My boyfriends' memorial service was yesterday. Several of our friends and family members met here, today. This was one of his favorite breakfast spots!"}
{"text":"Great brunch/breakfast food! Their ample choices of pancakes makes me so happy!! Their eggs are always cooked just right and the food is so beautifully served- I find myself taking a dozen pictures of it before gulping it down. The place is spacious with lots os seating, but it gets extremely packed on weekends during brunch. The wait has been over an hour sometimes for a table for 2. The service is pretty fast and efficient and the food has always been great no matter what I ordered. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one of my wife's and my top-5 go-to places.  We've been going for years and years now.  That whole time, we've seen a lot of the staff remain the same.  I take that as a sign that the owner treats his people well, which is a good thing.  We've also seen a number of the Latin BOH staff graduate to server, which I take as a sign the owner appreciates ALL of his staff.  Another good thing.  All the staff is friendly, and never fail to take good care of us.  We're total regulars now so they know us well, but they were always great to us.  The food.  Their pancakes are the best.  The perfect kind of light-n-fluffy cakes that soak up the butter and syrup without becoming sodden or heavy.  The potato pancakes are nice and potato-ey, and the applesauce is cinnamon-y good on top.  The swedish pancakes are light and eggy and the lingonberries are fantastic on them.  I wish I could find lingonberry jam somewhere around here!  the dutch baby is a real investment of time and appetite (be hungry!) but is worth it if you like a traditional type of pan cake, served with lemon and powdered sugar.  The sausage is good, and they offer turkey sausage which is tasty and probably half the calories.  The bacon is thick-cut, so order it crispy if you like your bacon crunchy.  The coffee is average to decent and gets the job done.  My wife likes their oatmeal - I can't comment on that.  OJ is fresh-squeezed and delicious.  The hashbrowns are unique in that they arrive in the shape of a flying saucer.  The exterior is super-crunchy and browned, and the interior is fluffy bits like the inside of a tater tot.  My wife loves them, but I prefer hashbrowns that are shredded like tiny matchsticks, if you know what I mean.  Some people call them \"OHOP,\" which is wrong and dumb.  It's OPH, and I'm down with it."}
{"text":"One amazing breakfast n brunch eatery. Luvd their Eggs Michael and Bermuda waffles . Must try these delicious delicacies"}
{"text":"Interesting, yummy pancakes.  The egg dishes are blah.  The wait is unbearable on weekends, but I suffer through it once every couple of months."}
{"text":"I go here frequently. There are few restaurants who I feel make food better than I can, but this is one of them. My favorite are the Kijafa Cherry crepes, the apple pancake, and the Swedish pancakes. But honestly, every item I've had here is top quality.  I just wish they were open later so I could get this stuff for dinner as well."}
{"text":"Warning: Cash-only.   Warning:HUGE portions. But how can you refuse 3 scrumptious buttermilk pancakes with your omelet or almost anything else?  This little restaurant boasts traditional breakfast food the way you've come to love it. Hash, omelets, eggs, sausage, etc. I've had a few things from here, and I would continue to try more. Honestly, whatever breakfast food is your favorite, get it.  The omelets are oven-baked, which gives them an interesting texture on the outside with an oh-so smooth interior. The pancakes are delicious, but as an addition to an entree, too much for me to handle (not a complaint!). I caution you to come at odd hours though, as the wait during peak lunch hours is real."}
{"text":"We went on Sunday for brunch since it is very close to our house. It wasn't quite the quality inside that I expected since it is located in Southpark. I ordered strawberry pancakes and eggs, which all seemed very fresh and flavorful! I order my eggs over easy and they don't always come out that way at other places... props to the kitchen for making me some perfectly cooked eggs! Very filling meal, however, the service was pretty lacking. Had to ask the server twice for straws, and once we ordered, she brought our food and we didn't see her again. Not a very personable server. I would gladly try this place again, however, just because the food was so good!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was a superstar,  older woman and so friendly and attentive to our needs even anticipated our needs having our grand daughter there.  OPH was my first job in mid 70's actually inspiring me to become a chef and restaurateur.  My main job was preparing the famous corned beef hash in the Hawaii locations. Since then,  I've always made OHP my home and boasted on their food and quality especially since I've lived in Portland,  OR where the original location and family resides boasting the famous passed down starter cultures that make up my beloved Dutch Baby. So one thing I know and know well is OPH food especially the corned beef that I've made all my life.   2 stars are for my waitress and her service which if yelp broke the ratings in categories I'd give her 5 stars and hire her any day in any if my restaurants.   Now to the food.  It just sucked period! The Dutch baby was so flat and pancakes were soured only meaning they don't follow protocols for the starters and batter was old and not kept refrigerated causing it to sour. My so called corned beef was a blatant ripoff, they tried to pass off their older ham chopped up and with onions all fluffy and they couldn't make hash with ham because it comes out like fluffy hamburger.  Even waitress said others complained the same thing.  Don't take my word for it, see for yourself,  all I ask is you know what corned beef is and eaten at other locations besides vegas. They are cutting corners to save on food costs and waste. Shame on you!!!!!  My concerns and disappointment was addressed with the manager or owner,  the older gentleman but he denied my findings as a professional chef and was extremely rude even though I was being courteous.  This leads me to believe that the cooks run the place without challenge or proper management.  I will forward my findings to Portland along with the pictures of the fake corned beef.  I did pay for everything and never asked for a discount or any refunds.  It's just a crime what they're doing to such a wonderful franchise and food concept.   Change management and food and maybe we won't lose our last OPH in Vegas."}
{"text":"The Apple Pancake was \"out of this world\".  It is a special treat as few places make it. Everyone does omelets, pancakes, etc. We had always gone to Butterfield's in Scottsdale for their apple pancake, but they dropped it from the menu. So \"goodbye Butterfields, hello Original House\"."}
{"text":"The ONLY place my family will go to for breakfast in Las Vegas. When we visit my relatives there, this is a must go on a Saturday or Sunday morning. Very casual atmosphere and good with children.    Recommend for a Good and Casual Breakfast outing."}
{"text":"We won't be going again.  I was really craving the Dutch Baby - which is stellar, and I decided to treat my two boys to breakfast there yesterday morning.  The service was good.  We were seated right away, and our waitress was spot on, as far as service goes.  My oldest son requires gluten-free food.  Normally, for breakfast, this is never an issue.  Eggs, bacon and potatoes are easy, and he loves them.  Both of my sons ordered the bacon and eggs for breakfast, and both asked to substitute the 3 pancakes for the potatoes.  She said SURE!  Guess what?  Not only was the serving of potatoes huge (they could have easily split one - a really good waitress would have suggested this) - but it was a $3 UPCHARGE for each order of potatoes!  Because potatoes are SO MUCH MORE expensive than pancakes?  WHAT?  Ridiculous!  AND - we weren't told about the upcharge!  Since a stack of 6 pancakes is $6, and potatoes are $3, I assumed this would be a wash.  It was not.  Insane!  The eggs were fine - but all of the bacon was completely overdone - crispy and border-line burnt.  My Dutch Baby was stellar, I loved it.  It normally comes with strawberries, but they are out of season (and I understand this) and I was offered bacon.  Not only was the bacon overdone, I was charged $6 for it.    Breakfast for me, and for 2 little boys, totaled $49.98.  Besides my Dutch Baby, the food was mediocre, at best.  And the best?  We got home and my son had obviously been \"glutened\".  He suffered an adverse reaction immediately.    Never again.  I'll figure out how to make Dutch Babies myself!"}
{"text":"The breakfast here is wonderful. I always get a veggie omelet (with only two eggs) and pancakes.   I don't know what they put in the pancakes to make them so good. They are a pile of buttery, golden deliciousness. They don't need any fancy toppings. They are simple, yet memorable.  The decor is simple and unpretentious. The food is the big draw. On the weekends there may be a wait, but its well worth it. This spot is definitely a fav among the locals."}
{"text":"Came to the Original Pancake House on a whim based on friends' great reviews, and I was not disappointed.  I ordered the strawberry pancakes of 3 ($7.50) to-go. The pancakes were moist and fluffy. The order also came with a generous serving of whip cream, fresh strawberries, and the Original Pancake House's special strawberry syrup.   Staff was friendly and service was quick (5-10 minutes) for a to-go order. Great place for breakfast and brunch. I am definitely planing to stop by again to dine-in."}
{"text":"Overrated!!!  The food was like any other breakfast place. Nothing special. The restaurant also seemed to be a bit dirty. I don't believe this is a place worth waiting in line for, but many others do."}
{"text":"I love this place. I don't get here as much as I'd like, but the dutch apple pancake is heavenly! Decor is a little outdated and cash only at this location..."}
{"text":"The food is good, don't get me wrong, and the service is typically in the good-great range. We've come here often and have enjoyed it.  However, there has been a negative trend of late. OPH has begun to make some interesting choices regarding their pricing system. Things that were once complete meals now require additional purchases to get the way you once had them.  For example, I ordered a mushroom omelette. Typically that comes with the trimmings in the menu and with a delicious mushroom sherry sauce that really makes the omelette stand out. Today I was informed that, on top of paying the same price, I had to pay an additional up charge for the sauce now. Kind of a let down.  This place isn't bad, don't get me wrong. I just hate it when a place you were comfortable with begins the nickel-n-dime trend."}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch spots in Charlotte is definitely The Original Pancake House on Sharon Road, that is if you can get in the door. On any given Sunday the restaurant is packed with people and the wait is over an hour, but it is totally worth the wait. I have never had a bad experience at The Original Pancake House and I've tried many different dishes over the years.   Perhaps my favorite dish at The Original Pancake House is their chocolate chip pancakes. Now I love a good chocolate chip pancake and it's very hard to get them done just right. Most of the places I've been to may put a few chips inside the pancake, but the majority of the chips are scattered on top of the pancakes. However, at The Original Pancake House they put tons of chocolate chips both inside the pancakes and on top of the whipped cream that's on the pancakes. This makes for a great combination of perfectly melted chocolate chips and hard chocolate chips on top that melt in your mouth.  Also another favorite of mine is the ham and cheese omelet. The omelet's at The Original Pancake House are absolutely huge and I don't think I've ever actually finished a whole omelet in one sitting. Not only are these omelets big, but they are also stuffed with whatever toppings you want, so you will not be disappointed with your meal.   The only reason I gave this restaurant a 4-star rating is because of the wait time and the noise level inside the restaurant (sometimes it gets pretty loud), but if I were basing my rating solely on the quality of the food then I would give The Original Pancake House a 5-star rating. The food tastes fantastic and it is very reasonable for the price. You definitely should check it out the next time you are looking for a great brunch spot and have some time to kill."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast place in town. It was delicious and our server was the kindest  person. Ask for Mary if you can. She brought out fresh whipped cream to go on our pancakes or in your coffee! They offer large portions and varied menu options such as a  great veggie omelet, german potato pancakes and Dutch pancakes! It also looks like their hollandaise sauce is pretty good. My husband loved the Cherry crepes and I was beside myself to find PUMPKIN Pancakes off season! LOVED THEM!!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast food all around.  Love the eggs benedict with potato pancakes, and yes, they do give you sour cream and applesauce.  I also love the omletes but they are made with 5 eggs.  You can ask for a smaller portion and it should be less $.  I just love this place for breakfast but it can be a bit pricey."}
{"text":"This was our first and only visit. We read the reviews and thought we would try it. Well, never again. We all ended up with stomachaches. We could not finish our food the taste was terrible. The hollandiase sauce was the worst I had ever had. Some of our food was cold.  I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"We frequent the South Park location and I have to say despite the glowing reviews I was underwhelmed.  There were 3 adults and the food came out in waves in about a 10 minute span.  The food was OK but nothing special.  Definelty better than IHOP fare but just lacked that wow factor that others talk about here."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in Madison!  I've been waiting here for more than 20 years! My favorites are the German pancakes, omelets--they are huge, the hashbrowns--get them with cheese, and the bacon!!!"}
{"text":"Very pricey, but in my mind, worth every penny. We have been going there, off and on (moved out of town), for over 30 years. The decor is the same, the quality of the food is comparable but the prices have gong up (but what hasn't?).  The Dutch Baby and Apple Pancake are wonderful. Eggs Michael is superb. All their pancakes are great! The wife and I order three breakfasts with the idea of taking food home for warm-up."}
{"text":"This place is the same as the one in Anaheim, ca. The place wasn't packed as I thought it would be. Great service, the food came as fast and coffee was refilled without asking. Definitely will come back if I'm in the area since it's about 30 mins away."}
{"text":"I always love the apple pancake but yep the prices have gone way up. Not sure if this is because they take credit cards now but that's the cost of doing business and the price went up way more than 3%. They still demand you turn off your cell phone."}
{"text":"This is my go-to breakfast restaurant in the neighborhood. The menu has so many great things on it, but it's hard to get anything else besides the Eggs Benedict. Mmmmm! It's only downfall is its own popularity. Like any popular breakfast joint, it's always busy on weekend mornings and sometimes you have to wait awhile to get inside. The parking is also very tight. I don't think I've ever parked in their actual parking lot - I've always been forced to park on the street or even at the nearby Chipotle..."}
{"text":"Horrible the worst service. No take out. Terrible attitude. No English speaking. Totally annyoing place. When I ate there the food was below average and no substitutes. Just the worst service, unfriendly, no coffee, no refills, mean waitresses. Hated it!"}
{"text":"FUN! FUN! Fun! Great place to take the kids. Be prepared for long wait times on Sunday without a reservation. OPH had a line around the block. Front hostess was friendly. HUGE food portions, taste dynamite, and couldn't beat the price point."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, just darn good breakfast.  The pancakes are delicious, the omelets are HUGE and the prices are cheap.  The menu offers almost any type of breakfast fare that you can imagine.  Don't let the line out the door scare you away, it moves fast and the actual wait is usually no longer than 10-15 minutes.  If OPH offered delicious biscuits, I'd give it five stars!"}
{"text":"So yummy and so many pancakes to choose from! One of the only places that I know of in Chambana to get a good weekday breakfast."}
{"text":"We come here every Saturday morning for the German Pancake... And if you have young kids this place is great because there is a balloon animal artist that comes to the tables, my daughter loves it! Great service and great food"}
{"text":"Don't leave Madison without eating breakfast here!!! Great pancakes, omelets, toast, extra crispy hash browns!!! Cash only."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! The omelette was huge and delicious and the bacon was thick cut and cooked perfectly. The kids meals were very large and reasonably priced. We will definitely come back on our next trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good food. Shocked they don't serve jager bombs for brunch."}
{"text":"I had a very enjoyable breakfast and TOPH.  Good food, no frills.  We got there about 10 am on a Sunday morning.  Initially, I was surprised it is next to a Motel 6.  Not surprisingly, the place was packed.  There seems to be a shortage of breakfast joints in the valley.  It took about 30 minutes to get a table, but the turnover rate was acceptable considering how many people were ahead of us.  The server came immediately to get our drink orders as we settled in.  I finally decided on the apple pancake and I am glad I did.  Light and fluffy and not too sweet.  I got the junior size and I couldn't even finish that.  Luckily, my dining-mates helped me finish it off.  The regular size would be good for sharing.  Something else I noticed is that the portion size for the other meals did not seem that big.  I was afraid to get the eggs, meat, and pancake combo, but I think even a petite girl like me can handle it.  Some last talking points:  The decor is very retro homey.  The service is good even with the crowd.  Parking is adequate for Scottsdale.  And remember to bring cash."}
{"text":"The best pancake spot in Madison!  Same great good as the Chicago OHOPs. Super friendly efficient service!  Beautiful photo artwork to enjoy if you have to wait:)."}
{"text":"Great pancakes and sweet breakfast selection! Service was fantastic, from the hostess to the attentiveness of the the waitstaff!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a more traditional breakfast spot. I opted for the 49er pancakes (three very thin, almost crepe-style pancakes) that stretch across the plate.   They were very buttery and fluffy for being so thin, but there wasn't much of a taste difference to the traditional buttermilk pancakes, in my opinion. It was just like a stretched out version of a buttermilk pancake.   Service was friendly and efficient, coffee is bottomless and affordable. Overall it was a decent experience, but with so many places in Madison near the same price point and with a more unique menu, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfasts! Worth the 30 minute wait. Our group of nine had eggs Benedict with potato pancakes, omelettes, blueberry pancakes, chocolate chip pancakes, bacon pancakes, and  Swedish pancakes. Everything was delicious!   Service was good too. Cash only but there's an atm in the lobby."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal.  When I want something extravagant I usually do that at home.  When I eat breakfast away from home, I usually want some combination of eggs and potatoes with a side of something good and porky.  Depends on the mood.  I'm a waffle french toast kinda girl.  Never been big on pancakes.    I dropped in on a Wednesday @ 10.  Got a great park, no waiting, hostess was friendly.  Decor will not blow you away.  It is rather plain and utilitarian.  I actually like that.  I was seated under a tv.  I chose not to switch sides to see it better.  I came to eat.  Today was a day to enjoy my own company, not something you see people do much anymore.  No phone out looking busy and engrossed in some other thing.  Just me.  I'm a sucker for Benedicts and got lured into ordering the eggs Michael.  A house favorite.  Like a benedict but with sausage and a sherry mushroom sauce, comes with potato pancakes.  Sounds yummy.  Had my coffee and was anxious to see the big deal.  It seemed to take longer than it should.  I think my server was distracted.  It did give me time to appreciate the coffee.  It was VERY good.  I don't even drink IHOP coffee anymore.  But this was really good. I loved the mug you got that made it feel like your home.  The cream in the little pitcher reminded me of my childhood tea set.  Nice.  I have to say, and this is a complete digression; what happened to the pouring sugar?  Maybe that's why I love a dive so.  I don't open fifty million packs of sugar at home when I drink coffee.  Yes, I'm embellishing but it's annoying. I swear sugar packs are not as sweet as sugar in bulk.  Give the people what they want: convenience without judgement.  Finally, my food arrives. (Insert sigh here). The potato pancakes came with a little sour cream and applesauce.  I don't get the applesauce but anyway.  They were light and delicate. Seasoned nicely. Tasty.  The other?  Eggs were poached a little over, not a crime, sausage was not dry and muffin was toasted lightly.  It was the sauce that ruined it.  I tried but couldn't take another bite.  I wasn't expecting a Hollandaise, just something equally delicious.  It was bad, to me.  The color was beige like, the texture was...like some kind of coating or gravy.  I didn't expect fresh mushrooms but I really wanted to like it. I could not.  I called my server over and got a regulation Benedict to replace it.  That came out much quicker.  But...I knew I wouldn't really enjoy this one either.  AND I knew why.  The sauce. It's packaged.  They had identical textures and seasonings were very artificial in that instant packet kinda way.  One hinted at lemon the other at I'll say sherry.  Since I'd finished most of my first order of potato pancakes I ate as much as I could.  It was not unbearable, just disappointing. I own this one. Taste is subjective.  I get that.  The guy sitting directly across from me ordered a side of the sherry sauce for his omelet. I was astounded.  I can understand how some people can love something while others do not.  I'll be back.  I'll pick my eggs more carefully next time.  I want to have a Yay! I'm a fan kinda relationship with a pretty decent breakfast stop."}
{"text":"This place will always have a special place in my heart since my husband and I went here the morning after our wedding. We shared the apple pancake and it was oh so good! Yes, the line is long, but I don't mind. I'm just happy that there are still places like this in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The buttermilk pancakes were good, but the service was a little appalling to me. First while we were waiting my friend asked for a menu and the lady held it up behind her and said \"oh this menu, you want it?\" which was unnecessary and rude in my opinion. Also when I was ordering I asked if I could get one pancake because I wasn't that hungry. The server laughed and said \"honey, now that's something I can't do\" in a joking manner so that I was confused and didn't know if she was serious or not. She was. So I decided to get the potato pancakes which was a bad choice. They were greasy and were so thin they were like eating a fried disc with no flavor. There are better places to get breakfast in Madison."}
{"text":"This is going to sting a bit... I'm a local and have stayed away from here for awhile due to a few previous bad experiences and not because the food is bad.  I have stayed away because the service is not great.  I tried again yesterday a Tuesday mid morning (not a busy time) because you can't touch the place on a weekend without a major wait.  I had a party of 4.  We walked in with a party of 2 right in front of us.  No hostess at hostess stand.  Waited behind that party for 3min.  When it got to us the two girls behind the counter, not the stand, fumbled around and did not acknowledge us.  There was never a formal good morning or welcome...Finally 3min later she says will a table work and we said that's fine... She starts walking us to the table and we see 2 booths open.  We ask for a booth and she says, \"that waitress is over sat,\" so no, we can't have a booth... Really?  The waitress is more important than your customers? Ok... She did give us the option to wait for a booth... Lol how nice! So we sit at our table and wait and wait and wait... No drinks, No acknowledgement, No Nothing!  10 minutes!  So we got up and walked out... No one stopped us... Sad to say this is not the first time this has happened.  BEWARE: They will not seat incomplete parties,  they have no kids meals, the prices are inflated, everything is an add on and you will be lucky to get a max of 2 cups of coffee.  They run there waitresses ragged and they are usually frazzled...  They could make a few minor corrections to be better with service but ultimately over the years they have been more worried about the bottom line, then the customer.  The food is usually good, so that's the trade off.  I'm not willing to make the trade anymore.  They have lost a customer.  It takes a lot for me to walk away from a local establishment, but I have never got a warm fuzzy feeling at this restaurant. With so many breakfast choices in town it's just not worth my time or money anymore."}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint with excellent, tasty dishes at a reasonable price. One of my top 3 places in Madison for breakfast.  The chocolate chip pancakes are amazing -- with gooey chips blended in the batter with fresh whipped cream on top.  Their over-baked apple pancakes, omelettes are also highly recommended as are the crepes and waffles. I guess, that covers pretty much most of their menu! :-)  Love their fresh-squeezed OJ as well - just the right amount of sweet and tart.  The place does get pretty packed though and they don't take reservations (you get a number when you check in) or credit cards. So keep those in mind.  The best fast seating tip - ask to be seated at the counter. Usually it clears up faster and you don't have to wait for long (assuming you don't mind sitting at the counter with other strangers :-))"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! I have a hard time justifying $12.00 for an omelette but their meat omelette is well worth the $12.00. All their omelette are huge and delicious, as well as their pancakes. Service is on point as well."}
{"text":"I can't believe the negative reviews! Clearly out of towners who never really gave it a shot due to the cash only policy. The food here is amazing and reminds me of the pancake house I went to while in Holland. They feature a from scratch kitchen and have amazing baked omelettes. I really can't stand omelettes any other way now! Don't miss the loganberry syrup either!"}
{"text":"Ugh. This place is a joke compared to other Original Pancake Houses.  Apparently all are basically owned and operated separately.The decor is bad, the service is slow, plus they are rigid. I can't eat green pepper so I asked for the potatoes without them. NOPE!  They won't do that.  I never heard of such a thing!  The customer matters not. Prices of the sides were astronomical!    Thumbs-down."}
{"text":"Waitress was stressed because it was busy. Throws the check down when food brought to table. Husband's biscuits were stale. \"It ain't what it used to be.\""}
{"text":"I love the Original Pancake House when I went there before, but this time not so much. I ordered my favorite, strawberry pancakes! They were under cooked! Soggy, & nasty! I didn't send them back because my aunt was here visiting from New Mexico and she loves OPH! She could hardly wait to get there! I hated to ruin her breakfast by complaining about mine so I just ate my strawberries & cream and picked around the edges of my pancakes. I was very disappointed! Their pancakes aren't cheap so my aunt paid $35 for her & I to have breakfast plus the drive clear across town to get there to be completely disappointed. So sad."}
{"text":"The legends are true! This place is awesome! Long wait for a table on the weekends, though."}
{"text":"I absolutely almost died here choking on french toast, but the french toast is amazing, so I still come here. Their french toast is also special -- they use sourdough bread, light egg covering, and sprinkle powdered sugar on it. This is what french toast should actually be. Well it is what it should be in the Southwest United States according to wikipedia, but that's where I am from so take it!   They also have fresh orange juice, great prices, and very friendly service. Be careful to go on Sundays around 9-10 because there's a church up the street where nearly everyone attends Original after."}
{"text":"Five star all the way. This is a family favorite - even for dinner. They do EVERYTHING well. Our favorites include the veggie omelette, apple crepe, waffles and the ultimate favorite - the Dutch Baby. If you plan on getting this, be sure to let your server know when you sit down so they can go ahead and start making it. It's at least a 25 min wait, and if you have waited the typical long wait for this place...another 25 min can be painful. This place is every bit worth the wait, and they can text you when your table is available making it easier to kill time."}
{"text":"Had the German Pancake... so good! Service was good and the atmosphere nice. Would definitely recommend for a Sunday morning breakfast."}
{"text":"There is a long wait especially on a Sunday but the food is worth the wait. The Chicken Crepe and Vegetarian Omelet tasted great. The coffee served to us in their special cups was not really hot for my liking but the server took care of it without any ifs and buts. Great food and really good service overall ."}
{"text":"This was the worst breakfast experience. First they only brought one coffee for two of us when we requested 2, then when they brought the second one there was coffee spilling everywhere on the floor and table and they put it down right in front of our toddler. They didn't even bother to apologize or clean the table. My husband ordered Eggs Benedict and it was terrible. Overcooked eggs, horrid hollandaise sauce, and something that did not resemble an english muffin of any brand. The Potato Pancakes were dripping in grease and smelled like they were fried in burnt oil. I ordered a plain waffle and it was ok. We shared our disappointment with the food and service with our waitress and the cashier and nothing was done to make anything better. I can't believe people actually choose to eat here. And they ONLY accept Cash."}
{"text":"Get the apple pancake, it makes everything else bearable. They only take cash & no cell phones!"}
{"text":"An Arizona institution: the OPH by the Motel 6 next to the AmTrust bank building featured in the Simpsons. The place hasn't changed in years, even though it's spitting distance from all the crazy development around Fashion Square.  Across-the-board great breakfast food. What else do you need?"}
{"text":"Good food, service not so much. Server sheri was too busy to give any great customer service...knowing our party was of 5 didn't help her efforts since she automatically received a tip. And cash only here- with all these negative factors, I'll get good food elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is an old fashioned diner like place but the pancakes and crepes are just mind blowing!! The perfect kind of local business which knows its customers and sorta secret grandma's recipes!! Everything tastes so home made, comforting and just lovely! Kick back relax and have a beautiful timessome delicious tummy love!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. My absolute favorite breakfast place in the city.   Great service, great food. You may have to wait a while for a table when they are busy, but it's worth it. My girlfriend and  I are regulars, and the staff know and recognize us at this point. We find ourselves here just about every weekend.   My favorite menu item is the eggs benedict. I order this nearly every time. Also delicious is the hash browns, which, if you order them extra crispy only need a little dash of salt to top them off(cheese ruins them!). But really, you can't go wrong here. Everything on the menu is great. There are TONS of different pancake variations you can get. It's really a pancake lover's dream.  There is another location in Monona, which is closer to us. However, we come to this location because the cooks seem to take some extra care in the preparations, and this one just seems less \"greasy spoon\"  to us. While they use the same recipes, the end result is just better at this location in our opinion."}
{"text":"NEVER again!!! I brought my three year old here this morning for pancakes. We were seated at a table where she was not able to reach to eat. I asked for a booster and was told they dont have seats that strap to the chairs. I asked if we could please have a booth so that we could use a booster for her to reach the table. The manager came over and said he would have to put our names back at the bottom of the list....as they are clearing off a booth!! Two grown adults were seated there, not sure why it was such a big deal to have the grown people sit at a table and allow myself and daughter to sit in a booth where a booster could be used. She ended up sitting on my lap to eat. This place has been around for years but we will never step foot inbthere again!"}
{"text":"German pancakes, Swedish pancakes, one side of sausages, two coffees for. $34.  Way too high for OK food.  Long wait to get table when only few customers eating and had to ask someone to send waitress to take order.  Would not return."}
{"text":"Really good food. Good service and fairly prompt seating. Had the crepes and the wife had a dutch baby. Both were really tasty. This is our second time here and will definitly come again."}
{"text":"We eat here every time that we're  in Vegas! They have great food and excellent service. We always get the French Toast with a side of bacon. Each OPH has their own version of the French Toast, and this location definitely has the best! The bacon is cooked to perfection! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just had the worst breakfast ever at the Pancake House in Scottsdale.... long wait, bad coffee, burned tasteless pancake, slow disinterested service and when we complained they did nothing about it, saying that we should have told our waitress about our poorly cooked food (and perhaps we would have except she never came back to check on us again). I can't believe the lack of customer service of this place... they did not make our order right and seemed to relish charging us an exorbitant amount for disgusting food.... Maybe my standards are too high, but I will not be giving my cash ( and I agree with a previous poster...cash only?  please! It's the 21st century!) to this restaurant ever again.... Don't go unless your standards are low."}
{"text":"Food was great and the server was in a serious hurry. Once he left the check...he checked out. Didn't check back to see if we needed a to go box (we did). End of breakfast rush maybe but not service  oriented! Will not come back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast I have a gluten allergy, so was happy to see they could make gluten free waffles.  The wait isn't too bad. The weekends are packed"}
{"text":"No reservations accepted, so one must often wait with their 80 year old Grandma in the car for quite awhile before being seated on the weekend. Also, the strict \"your whole party must be present to be seated\" policy is taken very seriously! We had a friend who was running late but told us what he wanted us to order- nope, had to wait until he arrived then another 10 minutes for a table.   That being said, the food is fantastic! Nothing fancy, just excellent, consistent breakfast food. The Dutch Apple Pancake and Sourdough pancakes are some favorites. Once past the school marm who controls seating, you can expect very good service as well."}
{"text":"I've moved to a city without an Original Pancake House, so every time I came back to Madison I would go there for Dutch Delight. Absolutely love Dutch Delight!   Normally, it's a 4 or 5 star place. However, this morning, it disappointed me. The waitress told us there was only frozen straberries instead of fresh ones. We thought it might not be THAT bad, but we were wrong. The frozen strawberries ruined the whole thing (I should've taken a pic of it). The food was certainly not pleasant, but it is not the reason why I'm writing this review here. When we were asked how was the meal when paying for it at the cashier, we told the lady how we felt. The only thing she said was: Did your waitress tell you? Believe it or not, some people really like it! I do not deny the fact that some people may like it, but what I do not appreciate was the lady's lack of empathy and her solution to customer complaint. Last time, when we went to Red Lobster (not in Madison though), we told them that the crab was too salty, and they just offered us a new 1/2 plate. I did not expect the Original Pancake House to give us a discount, but at least I would appreciate a nice gesture like \"I'm sorry\" with a smile on the face. For a popular place like this, I guess they simply do not worry about losing customers that are not regulars."}
{"text":"I was too excited to stumble upon this restaurant, having loved the locations in Vegas.   Although this is a chain, the individual restaurants must have plenty of autonomy, because there were none of these crazy rules in Vegas. This is the only location in Arizona.   The food is just as wonderful. Yes, the cash thing is completely ridiculous (but they will accept checks with a local address and a local driver's license). But the food is so, so good. I can personally recommend the blueberry pancakes (my old standby), the chorizo (oddly but greatly served with a short stack of plain pancakes), and the cheddar/bacon grits (amazing).   Oh, and don't listen to people who compare this to IHOP. Totally different leagues (this one being far superior)."}
{"text":"30 minute wait on a Saturday morning? Great, no problem.   Me: can I have a cup of coffee while we wait? \"Server\": no, we don't do that.  Pathetic."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, if I lived closer I eat here every day!  Omelettes fluffy and packed with cheese and filling.  Hashbrowns made with fresh potato, not frozen.  Scrambled eggs light and fluffy, not paper thin or a solid lump like most restaurants.  And the dutch baby pancake... my favorite!  There is a longer wait for your food, but well worth if for the freshness."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place with Great service.   We had:  Eggs over easy, eggs over medium, hashbrowns, coffee, English muffin, rye toast.  What an amazing thing to actually get eggs over medium when asked for.  The sign of a truly great breakfast place.  That & good coffee. Watch out for the huge pot holes in parking lot.  Ah, WI winters."}
{"text":"This location of the famous Madison Original Pancake House is much less busy, well hidden behind nearby hotel.  Staff is very nice, efficient & professional.  More parking at this location than the other (which was all construction & traffic when we tried to go).  Great quality food!  Lots of favorites listed in other reviews.  We haven't had anything bad, try whatever you'd like!  The red neon sign may or may not be lit up, it's about 1/2 way down the strip mall."}
{"text":"Great breakfast on the cheap! I and my fiancé got four eggs, 7 pieces of bacon, a large slice of ham, three blueberry pancakes, three pumpkin pancakes, coffee and iced tea for $26! The bacon was possibly the thickest cut I've ever had and was cooked perfectly. The eggs were made exactly right as ordered and the pancakes were delicious. We were seated as soon as we came in and ourfood came out less than ten minutes after ordering. I would highly recommend this establishment and we both agreed this is our new permanent breakfast destination. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Come here for a no frills breakfast that's convenient to uptown. It was pretty similar to a Denny's. And it was packed.   I ate an extremely fluffy vegetarian omelette, which was tasty. It had broccoli inside.  Ironically (for a pancake house), I didn't like the pancakes or syrup.  Plain pancakes came with my omelette order. The potatoes were a bit greasy but had nice flavor."}
{"text":"You probably don't want to dine here unless you're a regular and at least 65 years or older. We stopped by a little before noon (they close at 1pm) the hostess didn't even direct us to our table, she simply pointed in a general direction and said \"the second to last table.\" The waitress came by to take our order and I asked if it was possible to pay an up charge to substitute regular pancakes for specialty ones. She already seemed irritated but apparently my question put her over the edge. She didn't even fully explain herself so I just said ok can I order a junior apple pancake, she raised her voice and spoke in a very demeaning manner and said that I couldn't. I told her I wasn't trying to make a substitution, I just wanted to order a junior pancake for my daughter. She just walked away without saying a word, leaving us dumbfounded. I heard her yelling over the kitchen counter, she came back and said that they were all out of junior pancakes because they were about to close. Alrighty then. Our food was brought to the table moments later (along with our bill) and that was the last we saw of our waitress. No checking in to see if we needed anything (which we did) and no refills on our drinks. Shortly after, two parties were sat near us. One of them were apparently regulars and the waitress' mood completely shifted, she was super friendly and attentive. On the other hand, a table with two gentlemen were sat right next to us and she was incredibly rude! They asked for coffee and she walked away from them before they could even finish their sentence. As she walked away she loudly exclaimed to herself that she didn't understand why the hell people were coming in so late and that she had been up since 4am. Maybe you should stop being a waitress after you hit a certain age where you feel that it's ok to be rude to people and make them feel like they're inconveniencing you at your job."}
{"text":"GREAT Breakfast, whether you are traveling, or live here.  All their breakfast food is great ~ my fav is the Pecan Pancakes.  Also like the Cornedbeef hash breakfast.  Their eggs are top quality and Eggs Benedict is also Excellent.  JUST remember these two things - 1. IF you go on the Weekend - it's crowded - so go early or prepare to wait. 2. They only accept CASH.  (They do have an ATM there)."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for brunch in Madison! It's always a good time when you come here, whether it's with friends or family. Be ready for some sort of wait, though. It's a popular place, but I've never had to wait too long.  Anything on the menu is good - but the pancakes and omelette are my favorites. The servings sizes are HUGE. If you manage to finish your whole plate, you'll be full for the next two days!  Just a head's up though, they don't take cards."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. If you go on a Saturday or Sunday morning you'll probably wait a little. It may look crowded but they turn tables like crazy. This place is great for getting Brinner (Breakfast for Dinner). The best part about this place is that the meals are fairly cheap. We get take out from this location at least once a week and its generally $12 for the 2 of us."}
{"text":"Food is ok, pancakes are moist which us a plus. I ordered scrambled eggs and it looked as if they were sitting out for a while....definitely not fresh. My waitress was friendly with everyone but me; I got my check delivered before I could have a bite. I ordered food to go and she did not care that everyone was the container was sideways, I complained and she opened it and say it looks ok to me and closed it. She came back with an updated chack and just tossed it on my table. Melissa created a bad 1st experience for me at this place."}
{"text":"This place is OK.  The food presentation is better than the taste.  Compares to iHop, I would go to iHop, but it is just my opinion."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Vegetable Omelet! I find I miss it when I visit other restaurants.   It is always fluffy, full of crunchy vegetables like broccoli, mushrooms, onions and tomatoes. Plus just the right amount of cheese. I add a side of there bacon, the French Press Coffee and BOOM! Perfect breakfast !"}
{"text":"The place deserves five stars however the service sometimes is not perfect. The food is good and the bacon is thick and delicious. The crepes are eggsellent and the omlets bigger than your face and thicker than your wrist. We have been coming here since their location on Decatur burned down. Love it! The are known for their Apple pancake which is smothered in apples with cinnamon sauce. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Good food. Laurel was a great server. Yummy bacon.  Went back the next day and enjoyed something else on the menu.  Cannot go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered the baked bacon omelette. Way too much bacon for me. Didn't finish it. Won't be ordering that again."}
{"text":"I can't wait to return to North Carolina! This food was sooooo delicious! I had one of the specialty pancakes with pecans and coconut. The flavor of the pancake and like no other! I am a fan for life!"}
{"text":"Although I have eaten their spinach crepes weekly for years, I recently branched out to their other, more traditional, breakfast offerings.   The fresh-squeezed OJ is delightful, the cooked eggs are well-prepared, and the bacon is tremendously substantial.  It is wonderful to go to a restaurant where the staff continuously makes sure the patrons' beverages are to the quantity of their liking."}
{"text":"I have been in search of good food for breakfast and kept getting this place as a recommendation. However, after visiting I thought the food was not as good as even a IHOP. I wouldnt go back or travel for this place"}
{"text":"On Monday, July 14, after reading a few reviews my father-in-law and I decided to give the OPH a try.  We were promptly seated and our waitress quickly took our drink orders giving us time to peruse the menu. My father-in-law ordered sausage patties, scrambled eggs and buttermilk pancakes. I ordered thick sliced bacon, scrambled eggs and buttermilk pancakes. The food arrived very quickly and piping hot. Everything was delicious! I could have sat there and eaten bacon until closing!  My only drawback is...I'm not a fan of warm syrup because it becomes to watery. However, if you like warm syrup, this is a great breakfast spot. The next time I'm in Charlotte, I will be returning.  Good food and good service!"}
{"text":"My family recently visited the Champaign-Urbana area of Illinois for the weekend and visited the Original Pancake House on a Saturday morning.  My family - my husband and myself, my teenage daughter, my toddler son, and my mom - walked in, saw the crowd of people waiting to be seated and almost walked out. Thankfully I was able to convince my husband to wait in the car with my toddler while my daughter and I got our name on the list and waited inside for a table.  Unfortunately, the Original Pancake House does not take reservations, so everyone is forced to wait around inside for an empty table to open up.  Our wait time was a little over 35 minutes.    The Good:  The food at the Original Pancake House was great!  There were a lot of different pancake options on the menu.  My mom ordered the seasonal pumpkin pancakes and they were delicious!  The rest of us ordered eggs and waffles and everything was tasty.  The Bad:  Obviously the wait time was no fun - especially when visiting with a hungry toddler!  The Original Pancake House tries to accommodate everyone by adding bench seating in the waiting area, but it still wasn't enough for everyone to have a seat.  Overall:  We enjoyed our meal at the Original Pancake House, however, next time we'll try to visit at an off-peak time.  This place is definitely worth a visit if you're in the Champaign-Urbana area."}
{"text":"In spite of the servers short comings the food is awesome! I ordered the strawberry waffle and my family ordered the banana nut pancakes and Bermuda pancakes. Everything was divine. Recently relocated from NYC and had been looking for a non chain restaurant. This will definitely be my go to breakfast spot. All they are missing is serving alcohol."}
{"text":"I have been to the Original Pancake house several times. I have to say that I think it is a step above IHOP and Denny's.  This visit I decided to do lunch. I had a grilled ham and cheese on sourdough with hash browns. The flavor of my ham and cheese was as good as can be expected. The ham had flavor, as some time ham does no have much. And the cheese was tasty as well. It was cooked properly and I enjoyed it very much. I was a bit disappointed with the hash browns this time. Not the flavor. That was great. This time I was disappointed with the serving size. Usually when I order the hash browns I get about three quarters of a cup. This time it was just a bit over a quarter of a cup.  My wife ordered french toast and bacon. I had a piece of her bacon. It was thick and tasty and cooked just right. TOPH does have a tenancy to overcook their bacon, but not this time.  I was very surprised this time on the time it took to get our order. We usually wait twenty to thirty minutes to get our food, but this time it less than ten minutes. I was pleasantly surprised.  One last thing to point out is our service. Our server was great. She was by to check on us so ofter. We were never out of coffee or soda. I am a real stickler when it comes to service. This was some of the best/"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town!! Deliciously decedent hash browns, fluffy pancakes, fresh-squeezed OJ, yum!! The lines might be long, but it's well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Very long wait but good use of yelp waitlist. Had eggs and sausage, waiter was very accommodating to add chocolate chips to the pancakes. Good experience. I will go back."}
{"text":"I'm so disgusted that this place is associated with the Original Pancake House chain.  I've been to this restaurant in Chicago, Wisconsin, the old one at Greenway in Phoenix and even the original one in Portland Oregon.  All those were great restaurants.  This one sucks.  Crappy service, cash only policy, cell phone policy geared to appeal only to the extremely old, and cramped seating ( you are like 2 inches away from the next table) ruin this place.  The food doesn't even match up the quality of food normally found at OPH.  My advice-- eat at an OPH at some point in your life, just not this one."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast if you are staying in the downtown Scottsdale area. Pancakes as you would expect are quite good. I always go there if I am in the area and I need a place to eat in the morning."}
{"text":"The original pancake house is my go to breakfast restaurant. The pancakes are not too chewey and have a great buttery flavor. They also have seasonal fruits, such as fresh strawberries, that go great as toppings. I highly recommend the chocolate chip pancakes they taste like desert for breakfast.   The service is very friendly and pleasant. One time our order got help up so they gave us some free fresh fruit!   Prices are decent and worth it for the great food. On weekends, especially during brunch, there is usually always a wait to be expected. I can honestly say I've never been disappointed eating here and it is a favorite that I go to frequently."}
{"text":"Top notch breakfast! My first \"Dutch Baby\" was out of this world! Worth waiting for a table."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's sunshiny in the morning (as they only open during morning time). Their french toast is my favorite, but also spinach omelet with spanish sauce is great as well. I don't mind waiting to get table for their food. You can't order for take-out during weekends."}
{"text":"Worst pancakes, you can taste egg in it, apple and dutch baby speciality are worst 2 things we ordered, highly unrecommended"}
{"text":"The Original Pancake House in Madison/Middleton has yummy pancakes and also has the best staff team of any restaurant in town. They are so nice and smart and fast and good (the waitstaff and chefs)--the pancakes are also fast and good, so good they are consistently great. Their Dutch baby is always spectacular and in season they feature perfect fruit like peaches and strawberries. Please support this great locally-owned business that supports dozens of Madison-area workers and our community! It's wonderful."}
{"text":"Best breakfast/brunch place there is! I've never had anything here that wasn't absolutely fantastic! Make sure you make a reservation if you can though, because it's always packed."}
{"text":"Overall it is pretty good - menu is somewhat limited other than pancakes, though. If you love pancakes, it is a pretty good place to go. However, if you want something other than pancakes there are better options.  It is also a little on the pricey side in my opinion. The food quality tends to be above average but factoring in the cost and somewhat limited menu, other breakfast restaurants are higher on my list."}
{"text":"Good home-style meals, open only for breakfast/brunch.  There is always a line on weekends and they only take cash so be prepared."}
{"text":"Food was just fine - perfectly good for a weekend morning meal. Wife had pancakes, I had eggs and toast.   Service was unacceptable.  Lindsey got our order entirely wrong and when she came came back to ask how everything was, she didn't wait for an answer and just said \"great!\" and walked away.  Never refilled drinks either :("}
{"text":"Breakfast!!  Nothing to WOW about. Although their Specialty Pancakes look impressive as hell. There is a Notice that these meals (even omelettes) may require an 18min cooking time over your basic bacon and eggs. Just an fyi.  Party of one. No counter to kick back at. Bummer. Great service though. They are all over you, and very nice. Monica was a sweetheart. Especially with what the servers are contending with......and you too if you come here.  Tuesday morning 10:00am. Waited only 5mins for my table. Once seated I'm surrounded by a couple screaming kids, several folks (who remember phonebooths)  chatting away about taking their garbage cans out, or having been to Phoenix already, etc., LOUDLY. All the while ingnoring those right in front of them? I'm finding it sad that older people have discovered public use of a cell phone too. They make loud speaking people louder.  Food is certainly worthy here. Except maybe the $3 small orange juice. Maybe even the $15 total which includes a $2 tip. And can most certainly get higher. I had a simple breakfast.  Will I come again? Probably not as a party of one. With my folks, or a \"morning after\" episode of a fine romance? Majority rules will have to win that one.  Give me the Mom & Pop breakfast joint any ol' time versus a place like this or similar.  But, your mileage may vary. I don't even want to think about a Sunday!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The only thing is the coffee isn't that strong. The pancakes were good but they were also really small. Thought they would be bigger. The spinach chicken omelette is Huge! And pretty good. Although the chicken inside is dry. The biggest problem with this place is how crowded it gets and how long you have to wait to sit down and eat. Plus its a little over priced"}
{"text":"I have always had great service here. The best pancakes in town. 3 pancakes will be plenty for anyone. Chocolate chip pancakes are the way to go. They only accept cash though so be careful!"}
{"text":"Long wait, host and cashier need to be more professional with attire and conversation.  Drinks are unnecessarily small and hashbrowns unnecessarily large (but outstanding!)  Omelets whipped and fluffy.  Your water will never be less than half full."}
{"text":"I took my son and daughter-in-law to breakfast today (I had a coupon from restaurant.com).    When this location first opened the food was fantastic and there would always be people waiting to get in.   The food has clearly gone downhill.  Each of the orders included pancakes.   The syrup was so thin it was like pouring water. We requested replacement of the syrup to a thicker one.   Our waitress brought replacement syrup.   It too was runny.   Clearly it was watered down.  This restaurant is obviously cutting corners.    There were only a few people in the restaurant even though it was prime breakfast time.   The other disappointment was we had a restaurant.com coupon and when we tried to use it we were told that they did not renew their agreement with restaurant.com.   I explained that the coupons do not expire.   I was told they would not accept it.   Called restaurant.com when I got home and they said restaurants have to accept them even if they do not renew contract.  Restaurant.com issued a $25.00 credit and said they would file a complaint against this Original Pancake House.   I gave the rating 2 stars since our waitress was extremely helpful."}
{"text":"is well worth the five stars.   It provides a great product and the service is also excellent. The food is always prepared exactly to order and don't miss the cream with the coffee this is one of the best dining experience  around straightforward get excellent"}
{"text":"Maybe I came on an off day but the service was slow, the Swedish pancakes were not fully cooked and the hostess ended up serving us more than the waitress. Don't think I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Very good food!!  I enjoyed the experience and friendly atmosphere. I also was lucky enough to see the Fred Astaire Dance Studio as I was leaving and stop inside. I have been very happily going there for breakfast and dance lessons ever since double win :)"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. I ordered Eggs Michael. The mushroom sauce had very little flavor. The sausage was OK. The potato pancakes were greasy with little flavor. My husband substituted sourdough pancakes in place of the buttermilk pancakes. He was charged $1.29 for the substitution. The syrup tasted like plain sugar, completely taking away from the pancake's flavor. The waitress just like the food had no personality. With all the places to eat in Vegas, we won't be going back here."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service!!! A first class establishment!!! I could eat here every day & I don't think I would ever get tired of it!!!"}
{"text":"This my favorite places to eat breakfast in Vegas.  It worth the drive away from strip or Uber.  My wife absolutely loves this spot for the Banana pecan pancakes.  I enjoyed the pecan waffle and the bacon is SUPER KRISPY with a K lol!  Fresh squeezed OJ.  Plus price wish is great!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend a couple of weeks ago. It was a Saturday morning and naturally the place was packed. The two of us waited for about thirty minutes before being seated, and after that the service was fine. I got blueberry pancakes and she got... hmm... banana pancakes? Well, regardless, we both enjoyed our meals. The blueberry compote that came with mine was incredibly sweet (but not too sweet to slather all over the pancakes!). As long as you have the time and patience to wait for a table this is a great choice for breakfast."}
{"text":"First time we went here & we loved it! We sat at the bar top & up came the owner,  Ron,  which he sat next to another gentleman next to us. He chatted with him, then begin talking with us & I will tell ya, what a nice guy!   I got a scrambled eggs/ham & pancakes & my Husband got the 49 ers pancake, both were delicious!  The only reason I gave it a 4, was the wait on food, however it was New Years Day. Great breakfast! We'll be back."}
{"text":"A lot of places called themselves the \"pancake originals\" but, no one can be compared to this restaurant. I have been to many many places in town for breakfast including the most common franchises (not worth mentioning) but, bottom line is this is the BEST OF THE BEST pancake and breakfast joint in Las Vegas!  I do not usually enjoy eggs unless they are made by mom and at Original Pancake House i enjoy having them. The taste is like they just came out of my moms kitchen with an exquisite flavor really difficult to describe. The bacon is my 4 year old's favorite and the pancakes are just wonderful! They are fluffy and the texture it's just perfection! No other place makes them like it!!!!  ALL other restaurant's pancakes taste very \"box like\" and feel like you are chewing in rubber....   Service could be a little better, as our waiter did not come back to check on us after he brought the food and we needed a couple of things but, besides that, I can not be happier with the food quality!   I will be coming back to this restaurant many many years to come.."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice. The first time I wanted to try it because I had seen the long lines out front on the weekends, and the second time because I thought the first was a fluke.   Both times the food was decent--standard breakfast fare with little flair. It was good, don't get me wrong, but didn't seem to justify the long wait.  What was surprising about this place is that the first time I went there the server tried to tell me what to order. I was told that \"complicated\" items take too long and I would be better off getting standard items like eggs or pancakes. I understand that they want to turn over tables quickly with the long wait, but pushing people off of menu items is a big turn-off for me.  The second time I went they were out of the item I wanted. I will try to get back there during the week when it's not as busy and see if my experience is better."}
{"text":"yum, yum and yum. not counting the 40+ minute wait (no, i'm not kidding), this place is sure to offer you the best breakfast experience you can imagine. the pancakes are almost perfect, the coffee was good, and the portions are...well...huge. (be warned!) this will definitely be somewhere i come on a regular basis, and as early as possible to avoid the crowd."}
{"text":"Good food. Kind staff. I was privileged enough to be there when they served their seasonal crab meat stuffed omelette. The french toast and pancakes were also outstanding. Also of note are the gluten free pancakes and other offerings (a rare gem). Get there early Bc the wait can get long!"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of this place just an average pancake place not sure if I would go here again. The parking is brutal at the South Park location and I need to do something about it because parking in the morning only gets worse in the afternoon and am I need to do something about the parking situation here I don't recommend trying to being bring multiple cars here just bring one car pack everybody in it because parking is brutal."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place for the family. The baked apple pancake is to die for with a side order of the applewood smoked bacon. This is also a great place to dine if you enjoy crepes and the coffee is very good and not too strong.   Before to hit this place early or in the afternoon on the weekends otherwise you could easily wait 35-45 minutes to get seated.  I've been going to this location for years now and the service has always been spectacular."}
{"text":"If it weren't for my heavy travel schedule, Stefan and Kim would nhave to increase their bacon inventory.  A great breakfast & lunch spot.  Also, one of the best cups of jo in the Valley."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place since I now live in the area and saw all the good reviews. What a disappointment. The server brought my son an OJ, which he didn't order.  I ordered one for me and I heard him say water. When my son said it's ok (to be nice) she didn't offer to take it and I paid for an OJ that he barely drank. OJ should be cold and it was near warm and not very good. On to the food-I ordered the eggs Benedict, which was so-so and a little salty. The potato pancakes were absolutely gross. My son who eats most anything tried them and commented that they tasted metallic-like. I thought the flavor was more fishy.  They were inedible-Thin, soggy, and nasty. The server noticed they weren't eaten and brought me pancakes to take home, which was nice since I didn't ask for anything. I do think the manager should have come by. I cannot believe this place is so popular and that people wait an hour+ to eat mediocre food. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm hoping it's the wait staff, but this is the second time this has happened while sitting in the left hand section. We're left to wait for a good 15 to 20 minutes before we even see a person to take our drinks. Since we're ordering the special Apple Pancakes that take a minimum 30 minutes to make, that's a good hour already. During the wait for our food there's no one checking on whether we'd like refills on coffee, water, etc. This continues well after we get our food and waiting to get the check.  Surprisingly, if we don't sit in that section this doesn't happen. It's like they forget there's a whole section of the restaurant they need to work. So if you'd like a good meal here make sure you ask for the main section!"}
{"text":"The food was good here, the pancakes were fluffy and delicious.  I ordered the bacon pancakes and ate them with Tabasco sauce, instead of syrup.  It was a little different having salty instead of sweet on the pancakes but it worked.  Service was not so great here, we had a little bit of a wait outside, not a big deal, but the waitress that served us wasn't so attentive to our needs.  She didn't seem to care much about what we wanted and offered no suggestions, maybe she was just having a bad day...  Overall this place is a hidden gem, not near as good as other \"Original Pancake House\" restaurants, namely the one in Ohio, where the diner experience was great and the staff were friendly.  Note: No credit cards accepted here, cash only."}
{"text":"Just your standard breakfast place but they do have really good pancakes. They're so good in fact, that they still taste wonderful the next day. If you can't finish your entire plate, definitely take your left over pancakes home!"}
{"text":"The first time I went there I had the tropical mandarin crepes. Thought I had died and gone to heaven! Absolutely unique and a perfect melding of flavors. Have gone back several times and each item is better than the last. The wait staff is attentive without being intrusive. And the cashier  is most helpful and friendly.   You have to know where you are going  (just past Brennans) but don't miss out on this marvelous,  friendly, economical restaurant. BE aware they don't take credit or debit cards, but there is an ATM right there."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here.  Yes you will wait at the week-end but the food is worth it.  cash only should not be a problem - they have an ATM inside.  No cell phones - makes a refreshing change - it is all like going back in time - including the decor.  Servers are great.  Food is fantastic - love their ham and eggs and chocolate chip pancakes - not had better anywhere else !"}
{"text":"Excellent pecan waffles - best I've found in town.  Skip the pancakes, though. Something weird going on with those."}
{"text":"No matter what time you get there, you will be having brunch.  That's because the portions of all menu items are very generous. Can't say that after eating there, I was in any hurry to eat again.  Good food, good service.  Breakfast in name only..."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to get a family breakfast. The banana pancakes are the best thing on the menu (in my opinion), but my mom swears by the bacon pancakes! They have a wide variety of choices on the menu, so it is not difficult to find something that you will like. The staff were very friendly, and the service was very fast. On the weekends, it can be pretty crowded, and there will definitely be a wait, so I would recommend getting there early, but it probably won't be a long wait, and they have a nice waiting area with comfy benches and plenty of magazines to read, so I don't usually mind. It's a little out of the way if you live on campus, but it is definitely worth the trip out if you are in need of a real breakfast!"}
{"text":"I went here at a slower time.  Our server, Jessica was very friendly and prompt.   We got a huge omelet, some crepes, and a great plate of French Toast.  Everything was very good and came out fast.   Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"So, this restaurant maybe an old classic but it is new to me.   The menu is traditional breakfast fare. Omelettes, eggs, and of course, pancakes.   I must say the most recent evidence of God on earth is the potato pancake. OMG! they are awesome! with a little sour cream and salt & pepper. Worth waiting in the Saturday morning line.  Customer service is a bit lacking. I went to breakfast alone, as I have no friends...or at least none who will get up in the morning for breakfast. I was banished to the single's booth it was a half booth with a bench a half table and a half wall to face while eating.   It was a bit like a when you skip class and have to go to the testing center to make it up.   Bad, and demeaning. If it were not for the potato pancakes I would have made more of a fuss"}
{"text":"Delicious homemade corned beef hash, and awesome pancakes!  The wait was surprisingly short given that it was Father's Day.  Staff is very friendly, and food quick to arrive.  Next time, I will get the apple pancake, which looked incredible!"}
{"text":"Pancakes are very good, the rest of the breakfast items are average at best.  There is always a wait. On the weekend the length of wait is beyond reasonable (1 hour +).  Accepting only cash is not reasonable for a chain restaurant.  Not allowing you to bring drinks from outside is also not reasonable, especially considering the wait time (isn't it o.k. for me to drink my latte while I wait?)"}
{"text":"Love this place! By far my favorite place for pancakes in Champaign.   Try the Meilike ( breakfast burrito made by mixing the contest of a Santa Fe Skillet with Swedish Pancakes ).  Ask for Liz, she's the most amazing waitress and will make your visit to pancake heaven delightful and without a hitch."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place  stopped by since I enjoyed the one in Detroit so much  although this one wasn't quite as good as the one in Detroit it's still rates four stars and is a great place for breakfast"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place since it looked different from the usual chain stuff.  Very clean, no wait at all on Sunday am, had blueberry pancakes.  Were whole wheat like, but had an odd, baking soda like taste to them.  Glad I got the regular order since they were pretty small and thin, esp. for $12.50 .   Service was fine, but overpriced in my opinion for what you get.  At least I tried it once.   Oh, and something else that struck me: No diversity whatsoever in the patrons of this place.  Odd for it's location."}
{"text":"My hopes for the enjoyment of delicious fluffy pancakes, topped with whip cream and delicious fruit, was dropped dead on a Thursday morning, all I can say pancakes were rubbery, dry, and they almost looked to perfect as if they were factory made, I do hope that the location that I went to is the exception to them all."}
{"text":"Really good food I love the portions yummy the Dutch pancake is delicious . Fresh orange juice  , i wanna go back again my only thing it's some of the employees don't smile and the way the table are lay down make the room very small ... but the food is great my wife and I ,love the place"}
{"text":"A friend and I went there on Sunday to eat breakfast.  It was good food, but slightly over priced...cost us $30 for two people to have two breakfasts, two coffees and 1 Orange Juice.  That being said though, I would go there again ...just not very often because the price is a little higher than I want to pay for a breakfast out.  Side notes:  If you do like Orange Juice, they fresh squeeze their juice every morning.  Also, the Venicia Benedict breakfast was the best dish we ordered!  It was delicious!"}
{"text":"the food is pretty good here but the service and management lack a lot compared to the other restaurants in this chain. If you want to order half order of one kind of Pancakes and a half order of another they will not combine them as every other original Pancake House does. Rather they charge you double for this luxury. Service is slow at its best and the prices are much higher, again, compared to others in the chain."}
{"text":"This restaurant was delicious. When we arrived they were packed, but it didn't take us long to get a table. The service was great. I ordered the patriotic pancakes and my boyfriend got a huge omelet. You definitely get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Great brunch site!! There's always a ~30 mins line but the food is worth the wait! large large portion and the price is nice too! I've tried the pancake, the crepe, egg specials, waffles..everything is delicious! love it 100 percent!"}
{"text":"Coming from California where we went to Pancake House all the time we were really excited to find one in the Phoenix area.  Boy were we disappointed!  The food quality is not what I've come to expect from the Pancake House and the service is crap.  The portion sizes are much smaller than we expected (we usually share) also.  The signs on the walls should have warned us away from here \"Cash Only\" and \"Good Food Takes Time.\"  I have no problem with waiting for good food but that's definitely not what we got.  Plus it's a bit pricey for breakfast."}
{"text":"The wait for our food was absurdly long. Do not come here if you are in a hurry. That said: the food is consistently delicious. Our party of three had pancakes, crepes, and an omelette and I can't decide which was best. Okay, probably the crepe."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and yes, it lives up to the hype. It looks like an old industrial building turned into a restaurant. However, that is by design. I must disagree with one previous post about not having 'healthy' options. Egg substitute, Canadian bacon, wheat or dry toast, grits without butter, etc are all options on the menu. Of course I got the Western omelet & a side of corned beef hash! Off tha hook. Nice view of uptown Charlotte and an outdoor seating area plus excellent service (thanks, Amy G.) make this an awesome breakfast or lunch place to visit."}
{"text":"Holy cow. Don't be fooled by the building, this place has a nice and clean interior. Prompt service and constant coffee refills. Pancakes are (as expected) incredible. The apple pancake is definitely worth the longer wait."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late breakfast with a friend. We got seated immediately and placed our orders. The waitress was very friendly and offered a vegetarian choice for my friend instead of the eggs benedict she got the eggs florentine. The food arrived in less then 10min this was great considering we wanted a quick breakfast.  Food was decent but not spectacular. I ordered the eggs, hashbrowns and coffee and it was about $10 with tip. A little bit pricey for eggs, potatoes, and pancakes if you ask me.  Most breakfast orders come with a side of pancakes, which is pretty sweet. All the staff made sure to ask us if we were happy with our meal before we left."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place EVER! No other restaurant can compare in service and quality! I would recommend The Original Pancake House to anyone and everyone looking to enjoy a good breakfast. It's definitely worth the money and any wait time. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was served hot and fast.  The french toast and waffles were delicious. We ate breakfast here two days and both days were great. The service was top notch.  Prices are reasonable and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast in Madison. Hands down, if I'm there in the morning time, this place is my first stop, no matter how long the wait. I mean seriously, it doesn't matter, this food is always top notch. I am sad to have been blessed with the gift of having non-cooking friends in Fitchburg, only to lose them to Seattle, thus losing my connection to the Madison Pancake House. Doubt I'll go to another location, my expectation is too high."}
{"text":"Ok my personal breakfast choices in Charlotte are either here, Denny's, or IHOP. This place is always packed on Saturdays and the food and service is great. There are plenty of items on the menu for people to choose from which is great. The omlettes are HUGE! And this is not an understatement either. Two or three people can probably share it and it would be enough.   If you want to try a great b-fast place other than IHOP or Denny's...come here and you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in Charlotte. They are very consistent with the food they put out friendly staff, amazing building I come here for breakfast all the time and will be a long-lasting customer. The food is always hot and delicious and the eggs Benedict Florentine is the best yet!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok, i've tasted better. Came with a purchased gift certificate but cashier would not accept it stating that management decided not to take gift certificates if it was past the year it was bought (i got it 6/2010) even if it clearly stated on the gift certificate that IT DOES NOT EXPIRE... ambiance does not give that family breakfast feel to it unlike eggworks (that place is great).  Would i come back and dine here...NO. For the price, not worth it."}
{"text":"BEST POTATO PANCAKES EVER!!  ...do I really need to say more??? But I will, just because this place was awesome. We were in town for a night and decided to try them for breakfast on the way out in the morning. I had the Egg's Benedict and my fiance had blueberry pancakes. All was absolutely delicious! The staff was very welcoming and super friendly. Someone at the table next to us got an omelette and it was HUGE! She said it was very good as well. All around just a great place for morning breakfast or brunch. I imagine this place would be the best hangover cure.  I really wish we lived closer so I could stop in for the potato pancakes though. ;)"}
{"text":"Great food. Clean restaurant. Nice staff. A Manager who works. Bacon was great. I had the Tahitian Dream Crepe and my wife had Bermuda Pancakes. We are going to come back again. Manager was friendly, visible and actively supporting the staff."}
{"text":"Be prepared for a long wait and below decent service. The pancake house had the audacity to switch their oil to peanut oil, thus alienating those who have the most common food allergy in the world. Disappointment just begins to describe my experience."}
{"text":"Worth a visit but not amazing. If you're going to be in town for a while (or are a local) then go ahead and eat here but if you're only stopping by l would explore elsewhere. The food was great but not amazing. Definitely had greater experiences at other breakfast places in Vegas. Serving sizes were well worth the price. The major complaint was the service. Sometimes you can excuse bad service (we all have bad days) but come on the waiter just seemed angry and bitter the whole time. He practically pushed us out even though it was a slow morning. I'd explore elsewhere."}
{"text":"I really thought the food was great, for breakfast stuff.  Passing by a table, I saw a couple order omlettes....  My God!!  These things were like 4 inches thick and looked like shepherds loaves of bread!!  I ordered Eggs Benidict (Venitian Style) with the sauce on the side.  It comes with potato pancakes.  Muffin, mushrooms, spinich and wonderfully poached eggs that look like mounds of sour cream.  Perfect!  My wife had 3 egg breakfast or something basic like that, also good.  Try the Venitian Eggs!"}
{"text":"their breakfast is good.  nice selection on their menu.   service is good.  and if you become a regular customer, they will call you by first name.  this restaurant is crowded so it is usually a good sign but I am not sure if there is a lack of competition in the area"}
{"text":"Terrific pancakes, fast service and excellent fresh squeezed orange juice. We bring out-of-town guests here and they are always delighted. Everything is made quickly and the food always arrives fresh off the grill. We have never had a problem with the quality of food, to the contrary they always knock it out of the ballpark.   A great place for breakfast or lunch. Reminder that they are not open in the evening. For many years this place has been packed with customers, which is a testimonial to the great food and the great service.   Suggestions: pancakes, orange juice, farmer's scramble, home fried potatoes and eggs, Dutch baby, chocolate chip pancakes (see my photos of the menu for descriptions)  Owner Eric Faulkner and the whole team do a terrific job day in and day out and they have many many regular customers as well as new customers all the time. Without hesitation they get five stars from me and my whole family."}
{"text":"I believe I'm making a point of trying to eat at a restaurant twice before giving it a review.  I did so with the Gambler's Grill, but sometimes you don't want to go back.  In the case of The Original Pancake House, I won't make the mistake a third time. (I did eat at one of these restaurants at Green Valley Ranch, but this review is specific to this particular property).  Both times were lunch outings, so I ordered a sandwich both times.  This is not a restaurant to eat at for anything other than breakfast, really.  Hence the name, I suppose, breakfast seems to be a better choice.  I ordered a sub sandwich the first time, which was okay but nothing to Yelp about.  The second time I wanted to change things up so I ordered a Grilled Ham & Cheese.  When the order arrived 30 minutes later (making us late to get back to work), all I received was a small sandwich and a few hash browns.  I paid $8.19 for this? I was fairly annoyed not only by the wait but by the inconsistency in the size of their meals.  The sub sandwich was much larger and filling and took half the time to get to me than this second time around.  People next to us, who arrived later, received their order first.  The food was fine, but I've had better elsewhere (such as Gambler's Grill).  The only thing I was happy about was due to a disappointment from the first visit.  My waitress never brought me a box for my sub sandwich.  When I went to get one from the front counter, I turned around to see the busboy tossing all of our food into the bin.  The manager saw this as she was handing me the box.  As there was little she could do to save the food, she got me a $10 discount off of our next meal.  Pretty much the only reason we came back again was to use this discount.    Never again!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and i have to say i love it every time i go, the service is great, and it doesn't take a very long time for the food to come. If you are thinking of going here I recommend the crepes or the pancakes."}
{"text":"The very basics of breakfast nothing extraordinary here. My trip would have been fine except I ordered hash-browns and instead got home fries. To make things worse when I asked the waiter about it she wanted to argue with me about wether hash browns and home fries were the same. Instead she could of said ok would you like something else instead. Oh well, I won't be back. If your in the mood for basic breakfast in a clean dining room with hit or miss customer service I dare you to check them out."}
{"text":"the apple pancake was too large for 1 person - i guesstimate that it's for 3 people.   Not for a loner and it's a little pricey.  Should have gotten the pancakes."}
{"text":"Love love love their Dutch baby! My kids are in love with the chocolate chip pancakes and their fresh whip cream is amazing!"}
{"text":"I eat here about four times a year - almost every time I'm in Vegas. Food always solid. Service always nice On my visit today I noted that the bathrooms were absolutely disgusting. It looks like that with the exception of superficial cleaning, the bathroom has not been cleaned in weeks. I mention this to the manager. They said they would look into it. I was worry about a restaurant with a dirty bathroom. Makes me wonder about their overall cleanliness. I hope they can attend to this. I will give them one more try on my next visit to Vegas"}
{"text":"Food & staff are incredible! 49ers, Dutch Baby, corned beef, crispy hash browns with cheese, peach waffle (in season) and pumpkin pancakes are not to be missed. There's a long line on the weekends, but they get tables down fast (usually faster than estimated). It's worth the wait! Plus, they have yard games to pass the time with antsy kiddos!"}
{"text":"This is a chain though I didn't realize it till we ate here for the first time. Quite a line at any time after 9am - I guess that means it's good right? Love the buttermilk pancakes. The pumpkin ones were delicious too. We got one of the baked omelettes today. It was huge and filling. If you have a large group, get here early and prepare to wait awhile. Definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I have visited the Original Pancake House between seven and thirteen times by now and this morning was not too unlike the others. I arrived at the front door forty five minutes past the tenth hour and was very warmly welcomed not long after. The familiar buzzing in the room was comforting and the faces I slowly am becoming more familiar with are smiling back at me.     They know why I'm there and the large order on the counter proves that they were ready for me. My fingers slid swiftly into my pocket and with a flick of my wrist I presented the once folded wad of that cool green currency. I counted out a very simple twenty, two tens, and a few pesky singles. Looking down at the counter I saw a familiar story. The money that we had counted and very meticulously counted out was not enough to pay the piper. Investigating a bit further immediately I saw, an almost too easy explanation. They've crossed out my original price of forty four dollars and wrote in what at the time seemed like a number they felt was correct.     I asked the young gentleman at the front counter about it and he very politely replied that it was policy to add a mandatory tip to larger orders. I stumbled slightly over my words at this point as this was the first time I've heard a restaurant employee explain to me that the more you spend, the more we charge. I asked him once more to explain to me why a food order that was placed to be picked up, would have a tip which is only standard to customers that would eat in. At this point I heard a bit of a racket coming from the kitchen area, I then looked down and saw a frumpy figure sitting down and yelling. Since everyone around him was darting to and fro around him as he sat still, I assumed this must be the figure in charge I was supposed to question.     I repeated my inquiry on his method of payments to which he cut me off and bellowed \"Everyone does it!\" At this point I remembered that this is also the only restaurant I've been to this decade that only accepts cash, although I was unsure why. I doubt that accepting cash only these could ever be a cover-up for any mal intent, what I was sure was that this was not a normal practice. I could clearly see his agitation, I felt though things escalated quicker than I had expected. Although the look on everyone else's face said what I needed to hear, this was a normal argument. I was at this point I had to remind myself that time was short and I had better places to be. He won this round but at the end of the day I paid 7 dollars to pick up my order, I wonder sometimes if next time I should just stay."}
{"text":"What a cool place! It's a winning combo of college dive/local institution and Guy Fieri hangout. The selection of breakfast and some lunch items is vast. Want pancakes? 42 different means of eating it. I haven't seen a Dutch Baby on a menu in ages! It's what would happen if your soufflé fell on hard times into a pancake and was working it's way towards turning tricks as a bread pudding. Dense, moist *pan cake* with a fried dough-ish edge. It'll feed a family of four and here it's under $8. I can't have much sugar and was given a cute little pitcher of hot sugar free chemical juice o drizzle on it - perfect. All syrups should be served warm and they are here, bonus! My son had the crepe Florentine (yes, he's weird) and a hot chocolate and both were delicious. My husband's corned beef was an interesting mix of fresh corn beef with a spicy kick and firm potatoes - a winner. The pancakes that accompany practically everything but a pancake order are think and fluffy and perfect. Best I've had outside of Dottie's in SF. We were originally sent there for the coffee and their unique habit of giving you actual heavy cream with it. We didn't order coffee. Idiots, I know.  The staff is unique: a preppy college kid with Death Metal tattoo he surely regrets on his bicep, a large African American man that is confrontational more than welcoming but in a good \"I know everything and there's nothing I can't handle\" way who actually breaks into a smile that changes his whole demeanor.  The total was a bit over $30 for the 3 of us and we each had probably half our meal left over.  It was crowded, loud and definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"it was okay nothing special, i had the German pancake ...eh it was forgettable food and the coffee tasted burnt."}
{"text":"If you want to be threaten this is the place to eat.  Horrible service, manager is extremely rude."}
{"text":"Good simple breakfast.   Ordered eggs over easy and they were perfectly cooked.   Service was fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of giving negative reviews without giving the mgmt/owner a chance to correct an experience. We notified the manager of our experience via email and in written letter form.  We did not receive a response from the manager or owner.  I completely understand the complexities of operating a restaurant and I'm disappointed.    Back story:  our 12 year old son specifically chose this restaurant to take his grandfather.  He placed his order and received something else.  He told the waitress this isn't what he ordered. She said if you want something else you'll have to pay for both.  Unbelievable!  We know for a fact he didn't order what was served (he doesn't like chocolate chip pancakes). He didn't bring enough money to pay for 3 meals and therefore he had to settle for something he didn't order.  Shocking!!!  So very very disappointed in this level of service and management's lack of response."}
{"text":"I came here a year ago and loved every bite I took. Today is a different story:   I got the first omelette listed (cilantro, tomatoes,  onions, peppers, and pepper jack cheese) with salsa on the side. With a grapefruit juice.   Salsa was the best part of the meal - 5/5. Flavorful and puréed the right amount to put on top of the omelette.    Omelette - 3/5. It looked baked which was pretty good but not what I expected. They probably baked the omelette on a skillet and turned it over to serve it.   Blueberry pancakes - 3/5. Flavorful but the blueberry sauce was very watered down. I put some on my pancakes and the juices were on the side of the plate since it was watery. It's also much thinner than I remembered a year ago. Despite these changes, the pancakes tasted good.  Grapefruit juice - 1/5. Watered down and didn't even taste like grapefruit juice. Just awful... $2 for a small is not even worth it.   Disappointed since I had high expectations"}
{"text":"In Minneapolis the Original Pancake House is a high-end establishment.  We were vacationing in Fountain Hills and wanted a treat so we trekked to Scotsdale for bfast.  We were a bit leery when we saw the exterior and the adjoining Motel 6.  The menu was very similar to what we're used to, as was the food.  The decor, service and the signs were joke-like...reminded me of Ed Debevics where they treat you poorly as part of the abiance, only they are not trying to be funny at OPH.  Signs tell you to turn off your phone, don't bring in drinks (coffee, is my guess?), don't expect to be seated until your entire party is there and CASH ONLY.  Our waitress was such a crank!"}
{"text":"I do not get it.  Why does this place get voted Best Breakfast?!  We had been once before and the pancakes tasted funky and the eggs tasted fishy.  Tried again today and were again sorely disappointed.  After struggling to piece together a breakfast and being told we couldn't do certain things because \"the computer won't let us,\" we again got a sub-par breakfast.  So if you want to wakey, wakey, eggs & bac-y, avoid this place.  You will only get eggo waffles and funky tasting food."}
{"text":"Amazing!! From the time you walk in all the way through the entire service. Greeted with warm welcomes by Mrs.Connie and we had a wondwrful service by Sheren. Couldn't come to Arizona and not have OPH! We definitely will be back. Amazing food plus amazing people!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. We ordered the apple soufflé pancake. It was definitely dessert for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Recently spent the weekend in charlotte and ended it here for breakfast. Pancakes were delicious and the orange juice is seriously the best. Also ordered the lox and bagel for my husband and I to split, it was also great! Kisha was our waitress and she's awesome."}
{"text":"The pancakes are probably the best that I have ever had. The food I give 5 stars, but service was awful. We sat in Julie's section and she was just all over the place. She could not handle the volume. Her attitude was fine, but she just couldn't keep up. The couple that was sitting next to us said to us, \"good luck! She is an idiot\" I felt that it was mean of them to say that; but after our meal I had to agree! We will definitely go back; but will ask to sit in any other section but hers:("}
{"text":"This is probably our favorite breakfast restaurant in Madison. The service is great. There are friendly faces everywhere you turn. The food is fantastic, everything on the menu is worth eating. The pancakes are outstanding, the texture is perfect and just the right amount of sweetness. Every other dish is also just as good. You definitely have to try this place. Right five out of five stars."}
{"text":"Went to try this restaurant after passing it so many time.  I tried the ham and cheese omelette and the flavor was great, but the egg on the inside was too watery.  The serving size is good.  It is pricey for the place and the service was not that great.  I also found a strand of my hair in my food so I only ate half of the omelette it was a dealbreaker."}
{"text":"Where do I start.  I'm in love with this restaurant for breakfast. Each time I've been there are always a lot of people waiting which makes you think there would be a really long wait, however, even with crowds of people waiting I've never had a wait longer than 15-20 minutes. So don't just drive by thinking it's too crowded.   The staff are great. With a restaurant being that busy it would be easy to get flustered, but I've never had bad service. The guy in charge of the waiting list is great at his job (don't remember his name). He keeps the revolving door of people working like a well oiled machine. The wait staff are also good. I've never had a bad waiter/waitress. Very polite and helpful if you need anything. The kitchen must be crazy with all the orders, but the food is always good and comes out fast.   I take all of my out of town guests here and they have all fallen in love with this place."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this OPH since moving to Madison 16 years ago. Many of the staff have been here that long too! When you arrive it feels like a reunion. Many people here have become our friends. It's clearly a priority of the staff to treat customers and eachother well. This place is so much more than the incredible food!"}
{"text":"The Original House of Pancakes isn't a fancy place.  It shares a parking lot with a Motel 6.  It's very simple and clean.  This restaurant offers good service and some of  the very best breakfast food in the Phoenix area.  Today I ordered the Swedish pancakes--thin crepe like pancakes served with lingonberries--and bacon--thick sliced, much higher quality than is typical in such an inexpensive restaurant.  The Swedish pancakes were delicious, and so were the Dutch babies and the potato pancakes ordered by the others at my table.  This place offers pretty nearly every kind of pancake there is.  Everything I've tasted here has been excellent.  This restaurant represents a great value and is a strong 5 star recommendation"}
{"text":"I was here yesterday and had an awesome experience.  The place was packed but we were met at the door by a great hostess who put us on the list and informed is of the wait time. The time flew by and we were seated, had an awesome server she gave us exactly what we wanted instructed us on what was good. We got the meatlovers omlet, bacon waffles, and grits...it was GREAT!! The omlet is hugh, and delicious. Waffles and grits were just as good. I would definitely go back and bring friends. It was great food, for a great price. Its clean,  well managed (saw the manager walking the floor), and a place I will visit again soon...."}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast! Ordered the hash browns with chili, onions and bell peppers with 2 eggs over easy. Loved every bite of it.  This combo should be added to the menu."}
{"text":"We went in yesterday with 4 young children, we were not the easiest people to work with, but Mary R. totally gave us a grade A experience. She was absolutely amazing! Food was on point too:)"}
{"text":"For Charlotte this is either the #1 or #2 choice for breakfast, a cut above ( in both food quality and service) either Denny's or IHOP. We usually hold our car club breakfast meetings here once a month, and the food and service has always been as expected, tons of choices on the menu, plus fresh squeezed juice. The omlettes are big enough to take car of you for breakfast and lunch. Try the Eggs Benedict, with potato pancakes... you'll like it"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! OJ is fresh. Had blueberry pancakes which were absolutely delicious! So many choices ! Service is very efficient so you can get in and out or linger over your coffee."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Charlotte, NC.... I always stop in. They have the best breakfast food!! The pancakes are award worthy!!"}
{"text":"The Original Pancake house is a very good place to eat breakfast and brunch. The pancakes are great and so are the potatoes.They also have good sausages and bacon.They have good eggs too. The sprinkle pancakes and chocolate chip pancakes are great too. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to eat a good breakfast. .....by Jillian (7 years old)....I agree with her review. I would like to add they need bigger coffee mugs as I needed two refills for one decent sized cup. The bacon and pancakes are the best in town. Prepare to wait if you come in on a weekend."}
{"text":"Have been there a couple of times but I am seeing periodic service degradation.  Food quality is consistent but service is going down.  Server never came asking for coffee refill. When asked for hot sauce server tells me I asked u before u didn't tell me.. I was like what.. Did I make a mistake of telling I don't want a hot sauce before and changed my kind later..    I'd prefer egg harbour or broken egg."}
{"text":"As you walk in you are greeted by a sign that says Cash Only ATM inside alright times are tough I get it.  Then you see the special board which read \"Good Food Takes Time\" and there is a clock next to that.  Fine that's cool but the problem is that after waiting for our \"good food\" it came out and was awful.  My wife said she has tasted better pancakes out of the freezer section at the grocery store.  $30 later we boxed up the food only to throw it away.  The good news is that we went around the corner to the Breakfast Club and had an excellent meal."}
{"text":"We love this spot!   Going here is a guessing game to if you will wait 5min or 35min. Always busy, but always worth it.   I enjoying going here because they have Gluten Free pancakes and that it hard to find unless you make them at home. The skillet are huge, always hot, and full of flavor. I got Turkey Link and Eggs- this comes with pancakes and its only .50 for substitute GF.   Our server was friendly and fast. The manager was a little awkward as he kept circling the area and tried to all up my coffee cup without asking. My server had already asked and I didn't want more. Chill dude....   Other than that, all of my time here has been positive"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Original Pancake House since the location on Decatur and Charleston burnt down . I must say I a bit disappointed and glad I stayed away. . Walked in about 5 tables appeared to be seated so very slow and what appears to be flour on the floor as I walk in . That threw up some red flags in my head , if business is slow and fully staffed it should be spotless. We sit service was quick in the beginning drinks to the table in a hurry ordered 2 waters a coke and a coffee only 1 water showed up. Vegetarian omelette was ordered, it a baked omelette that menu says wait time is 18 minutes it did arrive quickly faster than 18 minutes but it was very blah , note ordered with Swiss cheese but arrived with cheddar. Service was a little depressing waiter no smile , no chat and last did offer any refills on drinks even after visibly cups were empty. I even moved cups to edge of table to hint . The 2 stars were because they were open , wound not retry or recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Wonderfully surprised the food here is the best my husband and I ever tasted he had blueberry pancakes and I had the big bird salad the chicken salad and the fresh fruit was to die for the service was absolutely wonderful. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my family and friends we will be back,the restaurant was clean and had a warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand the love the Original Pancake House gets. The fact that their pancakes and their omelets are above-average sized doesn't make them great. In fact, I'd declare they're pretty mediocre, and I've eaten here several times.  There are quite a few things about OPH that irk me to no end, especially at the South Park location.  1. Regarding their pancakes: yes, they're good pancakes. Best pancakes ever? Hardly. Don't get me wrong: if all I had to eat there was a stack of pancakes, I'd be satisfied. But when you hear friends and colleagues rave about OPH's pancakes, you're expecting to have your dirty, hole-filled socks knocked off.   Not so much here.   2. Their omelets are obnoxious-sized. Seriously. They look as if the line cook tried to shove an entire turkey inside a egg wrap.   Look, I get that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. That doesn't mean I want an omelet the size of the Hindenburg. I'm not going to finish it. Hell, I may not even last 3 bites. I'm not fond of places that tend to overdo it when it comes to certain plates.   3. In the 5 or 6 times I've eaten here, I've never been waited on by someone who didn't have a shitty attitude. Ask for extra syrup or butter, and they look at you as if you just asked if you could perform all kinds of illegal and immoral sexual acts upon their mother. Considering this is the Bible Belt, some of those acts would seem immoral here, but where I come from, that pretty much constitutes \"going to first base.\" But I digress...  In addition to shitty service is the lack of service to begin with. You get seated, and maybe, just maybe, your waiter/waitress will take a few minutes from bitching about how much they hate working here - and mind you, I worked my way through college as a waiter, so I sympathize with having to work a crowded restaurant - and maybe they'll realize your coffee's running low and pour you some. Or maybe they'll realize you don't have silverware...while your meal's on the table. You can't eat pancakes with your hand. I mean, you could, but that's barbaric.  4. Speaking of coffee, their coffee is BRUTAL. A warm cup of water with a pathetic sprinkling of coffee grounds is NOT COFFEE. Then I realized they serve Royal Cup Coffee. This is the kind of coffee you serve to people you hate. Apparently, the management at OPH hates their customers.  5. Speaking of customers, something about OPH seems to bring out the shitty in some customers. Apparently there's an addictive formula in their pancakes that makes some customers act stupid, although I seem to be immune. Every time I've gone to OPH, I've been seated next to patrons who speak too damned loud and want to share every excruciating detail of their lives, or behave towards their meal as if they'd just escaped from a chain gang and haven't eaten a meal in weeks.   I know I pointed out the crap service, but nothing gets me as angry as a customer that treats a waitress like shit. Dressing down a waitress because she forgot to bring you your egg whites is uncalled for. And the behavior some patrons demonstrate here is a big reason why I won't return to ANY OPH, wherever, whenever. The joint seems to bring out a giant stack of stupid in people.  There are better places in town for breakfast.   The thing is, the existence of an establishment like OPH proves the incestuous relationship that takes place between \"well-established\" restaurants that are merely coasting by based upon past glories and name recognition, and a general public either too ignorant to know better, or one that simply doesn't care."}
{"text":"The last time I TRIED to go here I originally wanted them to do take out.  I called up and asked if they do take-out and was treated extremely rudely on the phone.  The person on the other end was quite self-righteous about the notion that they don't do take out.  I think it's idiotic.  What if I go there, order, then ask for my dish to be boxed up immediately?  Is that different than take-out?  Frustrated, my companion and I tried to actually go there instead, but found the \"Closed\" sign very punctually displayed at 1:30 on a Sunday.  Again, I found this odd.  Nearly every breakfast joint in town stays open until at least 2 PM on Sundays, and the half-hour closing is odd and hard to remember.    Sometime, I'd like to actually go there again, as I remember the omelets to be quite good.  When this restaurant was in Hilldale's parking lot it was much more appealing.  Far easier to get to from downtown, larger, and less annoying to wait at, and a wait is always required.  I find the new location to be strange, on a thoroughfare between shopping areas and squat and office-like.    Obviously I've had better days at ye olde OPH."}
{"text":"I know that this place does some things well, at least the chain itself does.  I used to go to it when it was at Hilldale and enjoyed the mushroom omelet quite a bit.  My latest trip to this particular OPH, however, was quite bad. I was in the mood for simple bacon and eggs and got the blandest, most boring and unpleasant scrambled eggs and bacon I may have ever eaten.  It's a pathetic thing to screw up a dish like this at a breakfast joint.  Cafeteria food would have been better.  I was treated with nonchalance by the waitress and found the interior to be a half-hearted attempt to make it appear \"country style.\"  I'll probably never go back."}
{"text":"I was thinking this would be better than an IHOP but not as good as a flying biscuit.  I was partially right. Maybe expectations were too high. Food was ok, run of the mill breakfast. I didn't like the syrup or the pancakes, the taste of one was just a little different and not in a great way. The do have outdoor seating and WiFi , so that's a definite plus. WS were there on Sunday afternoon and it was busy, but the wait wasn't long. Friendly enough employees. I had an omelette, pancakes and bacon. The bacon was a bit chewy. I didn't eat it all and I am a Bacon lover! It's more of a diner feel. It was close to my hotel, so I gave it a try. Next time, I will visit another spot. Don't think I will return. Just blah; nothing to drive out of the way for."}
{"text":"OPH is close to home and a regular stop for morning grub. Sure pancake is in their name, but it's their omelets that are special. Ham and gouda. 'nuff said."}
{"text":"There are thousands of underwhelming restaurant staff in CLT. I don't know who found the shining gem who is Juwan, but he's amazing.   Greeters/hosts usually just go through the motions, saying what they need, taking names, and letting folks know how long the wait is.   Juwan made it a point to greet every single guest like they were long lost besties. He constantly had a smile, always cheerily let people know it was worth the wait, and in literally seconds built a rapport with incoming guests.   I have met a few rockstar employees in my life, and he's tops.   Also, the breakfast was super tasty."}
{"text":"I love OPH!  I used to go to the one in Chicago near Oak Street and had so many great memories.  I had the pumpkin pecan pancakes and they were perfect!  You can't go wrong here.  The side of grits was perfect.  Very quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Not nearly as good as the one in Atlanta. Having eaten at Original Pancake House there, we were really hoping for a similar experience in Scottsdale . We were surprised that the waitress offered no concessions on substitutes and never came back to offer to refill water or coffee. The waitress never asked those basic questions, \"do you need anything? Is everything ok?\" The egg was served slightly burned on top and was extremely hard. The general presentation of the food on the plate was very average and far below the impressive presentations from their Atlanta branch. We did get great assistance from the bust boy who got us extra water and offered to refill our coffee. He seemed genuinely attentive but he was obviously assisting outside of his normal capacity while cleaning tables. If you're looking for a special breakfast experience in Scottsdale I would look elsewhere. If you just need to eat, it will do."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place, always crowded so expect to wait. Just as good as the original place on charleston."}
{"text":"Never had bad food or service, so this review is no reflection on either. But the restaurant is in dire need of cleaning. The ceiling tiles are black with dust around every air register. The walls show spill lines when benches are moved, the the corners haven't seen a mop in who know how long. Place is only open half days, so there isn't any reason why it can't be clean."}
{"text":"Looonnngg wait, suppose it's worth it to some, but definitely not one of my fave brunch places.  Great OJ, however."}
{"text":"The two years I lived in Madison, I went to this Original Pancake House location almost every Sunday.   I didn't even mind the wait--it gave me an opportunity to read the newspaper.   I usually got pancakes, bacon, and hash browns.  Their hashbrowns are more like an oniony hashbrown cake with an almost mashed potato like interior.  One time I tried their orange juice, and then that became part of my Sunday routine as well.    This place made me regret each time I had previously poisoned myself with Perkins' pancakes. I try to make it a point to go here whenever I'm back in town."}
{"text":"The staff and owner of this location are the best at making and serving Breakfast. We go there regularly and have never had a bad experience. Drew and his folks seem to truly enjoy making everyone comfortable and well-fed. The menu is straightforward and the bacon is outstanding. The only hints I have are to try to get there early to minimize the wait time and bring cash, they do not accept credit cards."}
{"text":"This places gives big portions. I go straight to ordering strawberry crepes, but a half size is enough for me. I tried the benedict & it was good. A side of hot chocolate satisfied my craves & a Oreo milkshake can be made. Love the fact that they leave the left over milkshake in the mixing cup for you to have as well. You'll be amazed when your omelet arrives to the table :)"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday for lunch. We knew it was going to be super busy so we got here around 12:30......no wait! Oh man, now I know why there is always a wait for this place!!  The menu is huge......we were struggling with what to even get! We ended up settling on splitting the Cheesesteak omelet. The omelets all come with 3 pancakes...... I dont think I could ever eat an entire omelet and 3 pancakes myself! Hence the splitting. We substituted the regular buttermilk pancakes for the pumpkin pancakes (I think it was like a $2 upcharge). Good decision. The omelet was sooooo good. Never had anything like it before....cheesesteak in an omelet! The pumpkin pacakes took the cake though! They were served with this legit whipped cream (yes, I know, awful for you but I lived alittle and had some). Could quite possibly be one of the best pancakes I have ever had!   This place is breakfast food heaven!"}
{"text":"i was here last sunday.parking was tight.  the place was packed but since i was by myself i was seated quickly. the waitress was very sweet and the place looked clean. i had an omlette home fries and of course i had to try the pancakes. I ha orange juice and it was warm and gross. water was ok. the omlette was big and fluffy but it was almost tasteless. the homefries were good and the pancakes were good too. overall i would say my experience was ok."}
{"text":"Great place for a cheap breakfast or a helpful hungover cure. Had the buckwheat pancakes and hashed browns-nice and fluffy cakes and hash browns cooked to perfection. Loved the adorable pottery coffee cups and the coffee was the perfect pick me up. Definitely check it out when you are in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the texting system for seating guests doesn't work.  My family waited over an hour because of the issue and not as much as a sorry."}
{"text":"Delicious, every single time. Eat here about 2-3 times a month, usually getting the classic thick cut bacon, eggs, with two delicious pancakes. Coffee is great and refilled often, service always meets or exceeds expectations. Little cramped if you're seated at one of the small tables in the middle, and you're sometimes awkwardly close to the table next to you, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I eat at the Original Pancake House often because I live nearby.  I sometimes get the Eggs Benedict or the Sourdough French Toast or the Potato Pancakes with sour cream or the biscuits and gravy.   My particular favorites are the Swedish Pancakes with ligonberries on top (dusted with powdered sugar). I first had Swedish pancakes on a visit to the Upper Penninsula of Michigan back in the 1970s, and I've liked them ever since.  My other favorite is the Cherry Kijafa crepes which are crepes topped with cherries in a cherry kijafa liqueur sauce. My mother always liked a taste of Cherry Kijafa around Chrismas time.   I was really hungry and it was below zero when I went there last week, so I had the Swedish pancakes followed by the Cherry Kijafa crepes, and lots of hot black coffee. I was good for all day.  The prices are reasonable and I've always had good service."}
{"text":"This is the first time my family has been here. Actually never new it was there. We were positively surprised at the number of choices on there menu.  We did have to wait 25 mins for a table. The manager stated that was nothing compared to mother's day. She was on the dot with time and the server pointed out a few of her favorites. Jessica was very helpful. They also have fresh squeezed orange juice. Worth every penny. The manager gave us a menu and said we can order to go which will be helpful when we are in a crunch. The only thing , although they have gluten free pancakes they don't have gluten free bread."}
{"text":"2 words:  AWESOME AND QUICK..took about 25 mins to get seated but afterwards it was a great experience.  They made my eggs just as ordered and I was able to enjoy my friends without sending it back.  Meal was also quite affordable..great stop for my first time there and in Charlotte.."}
{"text":"May 1, 2015 07:00am chocolate chips pancake~ I'm a early bird."}
{"text":"I like it a lot, I recommend this place to Arizona natives and tourists. Has a old time diner feel to it. Has decent coffee. Great corn beef hash best thing on the menu. Omelets are pretty good and pancakes are great."}
{"text":"Tried a Dutch baby pancake for the first time. It was like a crepe and popover in one, and it was delicious! Our waitress told us it would take about 15 minutes, but it was more like 30-45 minutes. (A couple who was seated after us finished their meals and left before our food came out.) It's harder to wait that long when you have hungry little ones with you. Everything else was mediocre at best. I wasn't impressed with their buttermilk pancakes or omelette. My husband seemed to enjoy his omelette though."}
{"text":"Yay! We finally got to try this place. Last time we came, they were closed (we didn't know they close after 2pm) and the time before it was waay too packed and I was starving so we went else where. The place is set up granny style inside (made to look like your grandma's kitchen? I don't know..?) but it's cute and the food we ordered including the pancakes were delicious! Looking around, it looked like it was very common for people to take home leftovers because they'd all be carting away leftover bags from their meals, which is a good sign. The servers were nice and they all seemed to be very happy. Yes, this place is definitely better than IHOP! I'm only giving it 4 stars though because this place seems to always have a wait (we waited 20 min) but hey, if the food's good then it should be worth the wait."}
{"text":"I went to OPH for dinner and decided on the eggs, bacon and pancakes. The pancakes and bacon were pretty good. The eggs I ordered scrambled and they were too dry for me. Two things stood out to me about the service. I was drinking coffee and the waitress asked if I wanted my coffee topped off with 'decaf' - I wasn't drinking decaf. Also, when I asked for more pancake syrup she brought me the almost empty (used) syrup from the neighboring table.... yuck!"}
{"text":"Husband and I ventured here one rainy weekend morning when the wait at our favorite neighborhood breakfast joint, Toast of Dilworth, seemed too long to bear. Afterward, I'd wished we had waited - though OPH was by no means BAD. It just wasn't of comparable quality, ambiance or service.  My veggie omelet and pancake sides were served hot. The omelet was bursting with veggies and - is it possible? - too much cheese. Husband's bacon, eggs & pancakes were also good - the bacon seemed impossibly long, and was truly thick-cut as advertised. Everything was cooked to order, but had that industrial air where you know things like the omelets come from premixed, cartoned egg 'batter'. Not bad, just not quite what we prefer. Syrup wasn't real maple, just your usual IHOP-y Aunt Butterworth approximation.   The setting is also a bit industrial, feeling a bit like a former garage or hanger of some kind. Seats are tightly packed in, so you end up a bit closer to your dining neighbors than we usually prefer.   There was a long wait when we arrived, which I get the feeling is pretty typical here, but they at least moved steadily - if not ultra-quickly -  through the wait list.   I'm not sure if we'd visit OPH again when we have such stellar competition closer to home, but I'm glad we tried it, at least once."}
{"text":"We have been coming here long enough to know what times are best to avoid the crowds. Sometimes the wait can get pretty long though, especially on the weekends, so be prepared.This is my favorite place to grab pancakes. My go to is the banana batter with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. The hashbrown is also amazing. Tip: cash or check only. They do have an ATM on site, but you'll most likely had to pay fees."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I've eaten at other Original Pancake House locations around the country. Always a good experience. Not so much here. On the positive side, we were seated right away, and my coffee was never cold. Food was okay. They were a little on the thrifty side with the butter and syrup for the pancakes. The overall service felt very rushed and almost impersonal. Never got asked if everything was okay until we checked out, but you better believe the check appeared on the table right after the food did.  This was my first and most likely last visit to this location. Will stick with the other places I know."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Vegas, I try to make it a point to come here for a decent, no-rush, enjoyable breakfast.  The portions are decent, the service is friendly and consistent, and the coffee always tastes great.  It's away from The Strip and feels like a comfortable neighborhood place like I'm used to in SF, even though it is a small chain (of sorts).  My cousin loves his bacon cooked just right and crispy.  OPH delivers it right every time.  My taste is simple: scramble eggs, my meat choice of the day, toast, and the always there, good quality pancakes.  Again, OPH delivers consistently and I'm happy.  On occasion, I've had an omelete and it has arrived delicious as expected.  The place does get busy on weekend mornings, so a 20-30 minute wait is possible.    I'm never disappointed when I'm here.  OPH gets a good checkmark from me."}
{"text":"closest OPH to the house.  been a couple times.    I have a mixed feeling about the place.  I like the retro - 60's look to it ( maybe early 70's - definitely not a 50's look ) I am a pancake fan and i kinda like the german pancake thing they do - i'm a big believer that lemon is just as effective as salt in bringing out the flavors in food and it definitely helps the pancakes.  the hash is also decent - big 'ol chunks of meat in the hash.  but the one thing you don't get - value !  The place is a little pricey."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! I'm craving it just thinking about it! Often there will be a wait but it is worth it!! The service is friendly and fast and the atmosphere is energizing. So many breakfast options to choose from there is something on the menu for everyone! You really can't order a wrong thing! I definitely can't wait to go back and recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a consistent experience, delicious breakfast food, friendly service, and good coffee, this is the spot.  I've been coming here for about 10 years now. Tip: I used to work nearby, and if you call ahead and ask for pickup they package everything well (they'll even do coffee to go if you ask nicely). Good looking staff. ;) My favorites: the blueberry pancakes, and the spinach omelette w feta. CASH ONLY. They now have an atm."}
{"text":"Okay so I ordered the apple pancakes and THEY ARE NOT APPLE PANCAKES LOL it's like eggs with apples. Really weird. But the food is good in general."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast today.  Wow, a bit of a wait, but the food was ... a lot of food.  Breakfast is very good.  I have heard lunch is good, maybe a little less great."}
{"text":"I was so excited about eating here, as I have eaten at other OPH in the US. However this location was a real let down! My husband requested the southwest chicken omelet without onions and was told deletions were not allowed as the omelets are premixed...Ok....So then he asked for a chicken omelet with cheese...he was told the OPH does not do custom orders because it confuses the cooks. Furthermore this establishment as been there for 25-30 years under one manager and this model works!!!!!! Talk about great customer service!  I requested the cheese grits with turkey bacon instead of pork bacon and was denied...not because they didn't have turkey bacon but because they don't do substitutions. I instead order a side of chicken sausages, which had the texture of salmon patties.   Of all the places to eat breakfast I am disappointed with this selection. We will not frequent this location again!"}
{"text":"Huge portions and good service.  Had the Nutella crepes with bacon on the side.  Only downfall was the orange juice had pulp in it!"}
{"text":"Even the grumpiest of grumps couldn't find anything to complain about here.   The breakfast choices are so wonderfully indulgent. I'm dreaming about the baked apple pancake right now. Wait the 20 minutes for it, you will not regret it. The regular pancakes, waffles, omelets - everything is delicious.  The real fruit syrups are a do not miss!    The staff is friendly and efficient. I love a restaurant where the servers actually work hard.  They move quick, they anticipate your needs and they make the customers happy. I'm guessing loafers don't last long here."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an amazing breakfast today. The food was delicious but more importantly the service was outstanding.  Each employee was helpful and had a smile.  Our server Sabina \"Bean\" was adorable and very helpful with my little guy.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Original Pancake Houses in the country and I have visited a few over the years. The food is always delicious the coffee always hot and the hospitality friendly.  My favorites are the strawberry waffles and the veggie omelette.   The waffles are presented with fresh strawberries and whipped cream on top no need for syrup it rivals the best strawberry shortcake you have ever eaten.   The veggie omelette has every vegetable they can pile into an omelette and still have room for the eggs and cheese. It is served directly from the skillet to the plate piping hot."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE restaurant. Hands down. All of their food is outstanding, and I go as much as possible.   Highly recommended to anyone looking for good breakfast."}
{"text":"Our server, Betelehem, was fast, efficient, and very nice, although she was really busy on a Sunday morning. We had two people plus an order to go. It took a while to get our food-maybe 15 mins - not bad considering how busy they were. Get the hash browns - they are really nicely done with real potatoes, skins and all. Pancakes are amazing too. Dense and flavorful. I got the veggie omelet and it was good but way too big so I took half home. Coffee is strong with a bitter aftertaste. I like it that way but may not be for everyone. We were prepared to wait for a table as the parking lot was jammed and people were streaming in from all over but they seated us in about 2 minutes. The hostess could have been more friendly when checking us in. The building has an open ceiling so all the sounds reverberate making the atmosphere rather noisy during busy times. Next time I might try the Dutch Baby. I remember those being pretty tasty from past visits to the locations in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Fantastic pancake. Give it a try when you are in Champaign.  We tried the strawberry pancake and the chocolate pancake. Both are good. Half order came with 3 pancakes, which was quite enough for us. Also, the orange juice is fresh.   We came here at around 1 pm, still many people there but we didn't wait. Service is good."}
{"text":"I joke about this place as home of the $15 breakfast.  Seriously though, the crowds are huge (expect 30 minute or more waits on weekends), but the food and ingredients are of top quality.  Sometimes service suffers a bit when they are super busy, but overall this is this is the best breakfast in town, price notwithstanding."}
{"text":"Coffee in waiting area was a nice touch. Service was great and the variety in the menu was excellent. I ordered an omelet that was customized and it came back perfectly. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast this morning at this  place good costumer service and prices  it was my first time  but definitely going back with my family."}
{"text":"The OPH serves up really good breakfasts.  Quality food, and a pleasant comfortable environment makes this restaurant a favorite  after church spot on Sundays, and just a great way to start your day any other day.  I like the Corned Beef Hash, and as you would expect, their Pancakes are delicious.  The Blueberry Pancakes are great, so are the Eggs Benedict, and if you are in the mood for a ligher breakfast, their crepes are fantastic as well.  Great food, dependable quality, and moderate prices make the OPH a winner for breakfast in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very popular so don't be surprised if there is a wait, especially at peak hours and on the weekend. Each time I go there, the service is always very good and the wait staff are very attentive. The quality of food, in terms of taste, is excellent. For some reason many of their dishes disagree with my stomach for the rest of the day and makes it churn to the extent that it sounds like my bowels have been possessed by Satan and a poltergeist is trying to ravage its way out of my abdominal cavity. Obviously when I'm sitting in class and that happens, I can't help but to think \"awkward, party of one.\" That is probably the main reason I gave this place three stars instead of four or five stars. I probably won't be returning though because of the horrific sounds my stomach makes after consuming the food. The service is consistently good and, again, the taste of the food is constantly excellent, so that at least deserves three stars."}
{"text":"Great place ... Had the big apple pancake Dish and it was excellent.  Good, prompt and friendly service.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I came here with my family for an early 7:30a Sunday breakfast. The restaurant is tucked in a plaza with ample parking. When we got there, our party of 11 was immediately seated. The interior of the place is pretty plain. Imagine a slightly more simple than the typical IHOP. Our server was great and didn't mess up any of our orders. She refilled our coffees frequently and was quick to fulfilling our requests. 90% of the meals here are less than $10 w/o a drink. I ordered the fresh strawberry pancakes ($8.40), and I was given 6 large pancakes and a generous amount of strawberries. And these weren't the dinky, small strawberries. They were red, ripe and looked just like those you would pick in the fields. My pancakes weren't too fluffy and were a lot bigger than I was expecting (when I hear 6 pancakes in an entree dish, I'm thinking the silver dollar pancake-sized ones). My pancakes came with whipped cream and a side of their fresh strawberry syrup. The portions that I received would have been a bit of a challenge for a normal person to tackle alone.  My family also enjoyed their meals, and from the looks of it, they also had good-sized portions for the price. Unfortnately, we were on a schedule, so I coudn't order the Dutch Oven Baby, which takes 20 minutes to make upon order. But I would be excited to come back and try it! This restaurant is highly recommended if you're in need of a local, delicious breakfast place."}
{"text":"Yes, 5 stars. The breakfast here, available all the time, is consistently superb, not the least of which is their fresh squeezed orange juice, by far the best in town. Excellent bacon, great corned beef hash, good pancakes, sausages, etc., basically anything you can think of for breakfast they offer and do it well. The pricing is very reasonable, good waitstaff, and never a disappointment. They have lunch and dinner offerings as well, but we always get breakfast, no matter the time of day. A favorite place. Caught in the South Park area with no dinner reservations? You'll get in here and have a great meal."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast!  Enough really cannot be said about the omelettes at this place.....they are easily the size of a football and full of lots of yummy goodness.  I always get the veggie, mainly because it's loaded with tons of fresh broccoli and lots and lots of cheese.  I would avoid anything with \"tropical syrup\".....it tastes like pure sugar with a little imitation tropical flavoring thrown in.  Yuck!  Other than that little grossness, everything else I've had is awesome and the coffee is always hot and fresh.  Hungover?  This is the place for you."}
{"text":"How many whole in the wall greasy Spoon joints have an hour+ wait for brunch on Saturday and Sunday mornings in Scottsdale?   1) The Original Pancake House!"}
{"text":"The Belgium waffle was tasty, turkey sausage was tasty and the egg whites were ok. The service was good. I didn't experience anything special, however, everything was good."}
{"text":"Love this place!   My boyfriend would have me give them 5 stars, but I'm only going with 4 until they offer vegetarian sausage... please? I shouldn't be so picky though, because the menu here is huge, lots to choose from! And decently priced.  The omelettes at OHP are out of control huge! First time we ordered them my boyfriend and I looked at each other, open mouths in shock, at their enormous size! I actually prefer my omelettes a little thinner, but I'm always impressed at how thick these are, but still light, fluffy and not overcooked. You're definitely getting your money's worth if  you order one of these. I would recommend the vegetarian or Spanish.  I totally dig the crepes here.  My boyfriend does not agree, claims they are too eggy... but I think they're perfect and delish. The Crepe Florentine is the best, Hollandaise sauce... mmm. Comes with 4 little potato pancakes. I really like the flavor of these, but they are too thin (leaving me wanting 4 times as many!)  Coffee is good, but no necessarily my favorite cup in Charlotte.   The wait staff and always super sweet.  The biggest CON at OHP is that you will most definitely have to wait for a table on the weekend (15+ minutes). The good thing is that there's a nice view of the city from the patio/waiting area. AND the kitchen moves their food super fast so the table turnover is quite quick (don't be intimidated by the amount of other people you see waiting!)  FYI: there's a BOGO coupon in the Charlotte Citipass book for OPH."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get breakfast here in Champaign.  The portions here are huge and even their plain pancakes are fluffy and delicious.  We always take out of town guest here for breakfast and they all seem to appreciate the food.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  On the weekends there is always a wait but I believe it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Right when you get seated you are served hot coffee. This was great because the wait on Sunday was about 30 min and they don't do call ahead or reservations. The food was decent, nothing spectacular. The eggs Benedict was really good but the bacon pancakes were nothing more than chopped up bacon in regular pancakes. There were always people coming around filling your coffee cup before you were half done with your current cup which was great. Friendly staff. Cash only-they have an ATM on site."}
{"text":"An absolutely perfect breakfast spot, with superb service, delicious chocolate chip pancakes and buttery eggs. Couldn't have asked for anything more on my way out of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"So I've been dying to try this place forever now. Lived in the area about four years and always drive by it and tell myself I need to go check it out. Finally I decided to try it out since had been running errands and hadn't had breakfast yet. This now will be one of my go to breakfast spots. I ordered the bacon and eggs which came with pancakes and ordered a side of cream of wheat. The bacon was nice crisp thick slices. The pancakes and syrup was amazing and is what really sets them apart from any other breakfast place I've had!"}
{"text":"This is one of the the first breakfast restaurants I've been to in Madison and I love it! There is definitely a warming family friendly feel vibe here. The cashier a middle aged gentleman who has great customer service. Our waitresses and waiters have always been accommodating and never leave you waiting long.  The menu is straightforward and the portion sizes are ginormous! Omelettes are the size of a newborn baby. Fluffy pancakes, quality breads used for toast, strong coffee brew. Love love love. Seems like this place is always packed, but the parking lot is big enough, and the wait isn't usually long either. The meals for kids are great - my tots can usually share one plate. Definitely will be one of my go to breakfast spots.  They only accept cash and there is an ATM located in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Best pancakes ever!!! My grandparents and I had an absolutely amazing brunch here at the Original Pancake House. We liked this location better over the SouthPark location because it felt more spacious and calm. I had pancakes and bacon which were SO good! My grandfather had an apple waffle with he loved and my grandmother had home fries, eggs, pancakes, and bacon. We were all very happy with the quick service and humble staff. Overall, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Before the Original Pancake House on Charleston and Decatur burned to the ground, my husband and I would often stop in for breakfast. At one time, there were several OPH's around the Valley. Now there are only two. And while this one is pretty far from our house, it's not as far as the one in Primm. And it was worth the drive to get one of my favorite breakfast dishes ever: Eggs Michael.  We both love Eggs Michael, so that's what we both ordered. It's basically Eggs Benedict, but swap in sausage instead of Canadian bacon and mushroom gravy instead of Hollandaise sauce. And, oh, that gravy! Creamy with a slight hint of sherry. It's so good that we always ask for an extra bowl on the side. This time, they just poured a double batch over each of our orders. Still love that gravy, but for some reason the mushrooms seemed a little slimy. Not sure if they were canned or just overcooked, but that's the only reason I can't give this dish five stars.  Our server was super friendly but a little slow on the drink refills. And, as I said, it was a bit of a drive for breakfast. But for special occasions (it was my birthday) or for those times when I need to get my Eggs Michael fix, it's good to know there's still an OPH here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Very good pancakes. I ate just regular plain pancakes and they were very good.  Everything tasted splendid and the service was quick with minimal wait time. I was expecting a long wait before going in because the parking lot was full but there was an open table. There is many tables inside which in my opinion is a good thing. Next time I will try banana pancakes..."}
{"text":"Ate here right after a running race, and it hit the spot.  A little bit of a wait, but not bad for Saturday at 10am.  Our server was wonderful, and I got a pretty standard breakfast, eggs, bacon and french toast.  It didn't disappoint in any aspect."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our breakfast here, the staff was nice food was delicious. Would definitely come back again the next time we're visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"Go here and eat theApple pancake it is wonderful and fluffy and delicious  This is an old-school joint that doesn't let you talk on the cell phone nor do they take credit cards  Yes you will smell like a diner when you leave but it is worth it!!"}
{"text":"This place is solid.  In fact, their corned beef hash is my gold-standard for judgment: with poached eggs and a little Tabasco, there are very few comparable meals as far as deliciousness goes.  The menu is pretty comprehnsive, and features, for instance, flapjacks.  Flapjacks, people ... flapjacks.  Name me another place in town that you can order flapjacks and I'll be impressed.  Anyway, the only thing that keeps this from being a five-star joint in my book is the fact that no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to get out of here for less than $20.  Maybe I'm crazy, but for a traditional American breakfast, I think that's expensive.  That doesn't seem to keep people - including myself - from frequenting the place, but on general principle I need to dock a star."}
{"text":"GREAT breakfast!  Not that far from the Rio Casino where I was staying.  Well worth the trip.  Lindsey was a good server, very attentive and quick."}
{"text":"just a heads up, they are now making their omelets in an omelet pan, which means they are super puffy and not very eggy and kind of dry and there was barely any cheese.  next time i'm going back to my old standby, eggs, bacon and pancakes."}
{"text":"We love the food here but Frankie, our server is what makes this place one of our favorites!! A must place to stop and deff sit with Frankie!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning around 11 and we got seated within 5 minutes. Had the strawberry pancakes with fresh strawberries, and they give you a lot for so cheap. Ive been to Bob Evans, IHOP, etc. and they don't compare to this at all. A must try breakfast spot! Wish I had one of these in Maryland."}
{"text":"Great food. It reminds me of the pancake house back in my hometown. The service wasn't that great and the prices are a little high. The food still tastes good enough to still go regardless of the service."}
{"text":"Go HERE!  Try the apple pancake that they specialize in making.  Oh my the taste!  The texture! The aroma! German inspired wonderful.  Not the standard American flat pancake, this mound of egg texture-ish flour and apple cinnamon mixture was a force. Mixed with a topping of the side syrup I had to take it to go.   Family friendly restaurant. We were traveling with a toddler and despite the hustle and bustle of this busy local favorite, they were kind and engaging with our kiddo.  This is a busy place and we visited on a weekday before the lunch time rush.  The kitchen was busy and the staff was keeping pace.  We did not wait but the location seems to welcome larger groups.  Please keep that in mind when planning your visit."}
{"text":"My visit here started off badly when the host took the name of the two women behind me before he took mine.  Being a gemtleman (stop laughing!), I didn't dispute it.  It was crowded on this Saturday morning but the wait was surprisingly short.  The ambiance was cozy and family style and the noise level fairly high.  My server was a  sweet and friendly and very efficient young woman.  The coffee was quite good.  My cup was kept full by a variety of servers.  I wonder if that's the norm or if it was just because I was seated next to the coffee machine.  The menu of pancake flavors was very tempting, but I opted for the Farmer's Scramble because I prefer the protein.  The ingredients in the scramble were satisfactory but overall it lacked seasoning.  Since this is called a pancake house, I knew I had to choose the buttermilk pancakes to go with the scramble.  They were good, but nothing spectacular.  Looks like I'll have to return for some of the more exotic ones to make that determination. One of the things I wish more of these breakfast places offered is grits as a side dish.  I've taken a liking to them but of the places in town, only Cracker Barrel and Taffies (huge portion) offer them and I'll not be returning to Taffies.  But I digress.  The Original Pancake House was a pleasant experience and comes recommended.  RETURN VISIT:  Enjoyed a nice breakfast there this morning.  The place was packed but free coffee is provided for those waiting.  Was seated and waited on immediately.  Couldn't choose between the Farmer's Omelette or the special Pumpkin Pancakes until the server told me that for an extra fifty cents I could replace the standard buttermilk pancakes that accompany the omelette with the Pumpkin ones.  Sold!  As with last visit, my coffee cup was kept filled.  The food was quite good with the omelette being very big.  It needed more seasoning and texture but sufficed.  The Pumpkin pancakes were delicious and I hope they keep them for awhile.  This place will become part of my breakfast rotation, replacing the now anathema Sammy's.  UPDATE and MORE KUDOS:  This has become one of my two favorite places to go for breakfast and I am here three times a week.  From the owner to the managers, hostesses, wait staff, and busboys, everyone is friendly and efficient.  A favorite waitress takes care of me and everyone treats me with courtesy, friendliness, and respect.  But I am not alone.  I can see that the staff here treats everyone well.  The food is great.  I have my set choice but have also tried all their pancakes and have never been disappointed.  Favorites are the potato, bacon, and Swedish ones.  Starting in October they have their pumpkin pancakes which are delicious, especially with the apple syrup my waitress introduced me to.  I have been having my pancakes with bacon and eggs lately and the bacon is cooked to perfection.  Being a regular, I also see many familiar faces on a consistent basis.  That says something.  When people keep returning, something good is going on.  I wish everyone at OHP continued success.  This is an unsolicited and unpaid testimonial.  Unfortunately, no free pancakes were given in exchange for this review."}
{"text":"Came for Sunday morning, had a half hot wait, but it was worth it! I had the Dutch Delight, highly recommend it. I did get a side order if eggs too, just to break up the flavor. My fiancé had the eggs Michael and loved it. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"OMG. Sounding like a teenage girl I Screeched with Excitement (in my mind) as this Hill of Fluffiness Arrived at my table. The Omelette so Light it Seemed to Hover,  Yet Filled to Capacity Inside With  perfectly cooked seasoned and Proportioned  Ingredients. As i took My first Forkful the Ham, onions.peppers,bacon,Cheese and Eggs  Serenaded my Senses. Light is Right, as the  Pancakes served with the omelette Proved.  This House is better than Home."}
{"text":"I love OPH. IHOP really has nothing on them. The bacon at ihop is flimsy and sad, but at OPH it is huge and thick! I love the strawberry crepe for breakfast, it is my fave. The only thing I wish they had is hashbrowns, instead they have a  breakfast potato dish which is good but not the same. Overall, this place is my go to place for a quick satisfying breakfast."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Crepe, and a cranberry juice.  The cranberry juice tasted like they were running out, and added water to it, very weak tasting.  Already not the best start.  The crepe was actually pretty good.  The chicken mixture in it kinda tasted like what you would get in a chicken pot-pie; but instead of carrots/peas, you get red/green peppers, mushrooms, and olives.    It came with four potato pancakes.  Now, these are NOT latkes, these are four extremely thin, almost flavorless sheets of potato.  As if someone made hash browns, froze them, and shaved a few layers off of the top.  It needed salt, pepper, anything.  The entire meal was decent, I'd go back."}
{"text":"This place produces the best banana pancakes and thickest bacon you will find! Dont let the appearance fool you here. Its locally owned and very clean"}
{"text":"The Original Pancake House is one Madison's breakfast gems. Admittedly a chain (and therefore not unique to just Madison), but just so good. This restaurant is cash only.  All food options are generous and you will be full for the day if you complete your meal. Pancakes are huge and fluffly. Omolettes are baked and savory. The house made corn beef hash is OUTSTANDING - so much flavor and definitely the best in town. You can get your bacon crispy or soft. Whatever your breakfast desires are, these guys will accomodate.   If you order an egg dish of some sort, you will have the option of pancakes or toast on the side. They will butter your toast for you in the back right when it comes out of the toaster. Coffee service starts the moment you sit down. Service and food delivery courteous and quick.  The drawbacks: long waits on the weekend and it would nice to see some type of special or added variety on the menu."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for breakfast, the french crepes are the BEST. We've tried many things from the menu, the food is always delicious and the service is always great."}
{"text":"Order the original scrambler   Get a bowl of strawberries with whipped cream, cream, and powdered sugar as a breakfast appetizer for the table -- Trust me  You'll wait at least a half hour on Sunday mornings"}
{"text":"You satisfaction varies on the dish you order.  With that said, I don't think this place is spot on for all it's dishes. You know how there are some restaurants that can do no wrong?  Well, this is not the place.  The food does have taste, but sometimes the ingredients like cheese are too indulgent. Make sure if you get an omelette to ask for less--  We ordered two omelettes that come fluffed up in a skillet (oven baked); Luv the idea.  I always opt for vegetarian omelette's, so I can get my daily dose of veggies.  It was good. The other omelette dish had way too much cheese, it was overwhelming.  The pancakes that come on the side with most dishes are not bad. The place is worth a try."}
{"text":"When I want a huge, filling, almost diner like breakfast...this is my jam.  Tons of variety, awesome portions and amazingly sweet service.  LOVE OPH!"}
{"text":"My wife and I would drive from North Scottsdale.  Classic pancakes.  Nice vintage atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just left and I'm so mad about the service, wanted to go out and have a great start to my Saturday but she ruined the entire day. We had a baby with us and I could tell this aannoyed the server she NEVER came to our table EVERYTIME we had to stop her to ask her for somthing she rolled her eyes! It toke everything for me not to say anything but again I was trying to have a good breakfast with friends, finally after I went to the manager (an older man) and asked for the water I asked for five times he didn't seem to care at all. I WONT BE BACK with so many other breakfast options near by, drive by this place and go to egg works! At least they won't ruin your weekend"}
{"text":"The Original Pancake House is the best place to get brunch in the Urbana-Champaign area. You will notice the long line and full parking lot as soon as you arrive here on Sunday morning for brunch.   I went there for a heavy brunch before hitting the road back to Iowa. It was everything I expect from a very good brunch and more. Their freshly squeezed orange juice is a must have. Their eggs benedict is perfect and eggs with home fries is worth every penny. The wait staff is very good even when they are extremely busy.   Definitely a place to go for a good old american breakfast and brunch."}
{"text":"This is my most favorite place in the whole world to have breakfast, they have the best omelets and hash browns and the pecan pancakes are to die for!! My husband's favorite are the eggs Michael!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Never had a half empty cup of coffee. Service was great. I had the Bacon and Eggs plate. Bacon was delicious!! Pancakes were nice and fluffy! Will be back!"}
{"text":"The food and staff here are very good but ordering a breakfast with (4) slices of bacon is like picking options when buying a new car. If you order the Traditional breakfast it untraditionally comes with (2) slices of bacon. Try to order (2) more slices is not allowed, you have to order (4) pieces for another 4.95....You can order a different option which gives you the (4) slices but it does not come with potatoes nor toast those are extra charges....??? By now the blood pressure is going up and what was supposed be a nice start to the morning leaves you wanting to #!?!#....#%*%!# So I most likely will not be coming back until they  learn how to keep things simple and \"Traditional\""}
{"text":"Very disappointing, getting my  49ers pancakes not cook the way always are, my wife's waffle raw (twice) a problem with the waffle iron the server said) bacon too crispy, I mean all around was not good,this is not the pancake house that I know"}
{"text":"Ecomony must be really bad cuz the Dutch Original Pancakes used to be loaded with strawberries and bananas and now there is only one banana and a few (maybe 4 chopped in quarter strawberries) ALL FOR $10+ WTF!?!?!?! WAY TO ROB ME ORIGINAL PANCAKE HOUSE"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, and yum.  Pancakes, waffles, omelets - everything I've tried here is good.  SO good.   If you need a good breakfast, go here now!  This location and the one in South park have always been packed when I've been, but I've never had bad service or food."}
{"text":"Bacon. Bacon, bacon, bacon , bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon. I love the bacon here. It's crisp with a little bit of chew still left. They know how to cook bacon. Someone once told me that bacon is proof that God loves us. I think the same was said about beer. Anyway, a short stack and bacon at this Original Pancake House. No other Original Pancake House makes bacon like they do here (sorry OC but you don't).  Get the bacon. You won't regret it. Then email me and tell me how right I am. You're welcome. Bacon.  Happy Eating."}
{"text":"Visiting LV with some friends, and we were in need of a good breakfast, but didn't want to splurge (again) on a 5 star place.  We had been to another of these in a different state and quite enjoyed it, so gave it a shot.  It is a bit off of the strip (which isn't a bad thing).  We were seated quickly, and our server was great.  The strawberry pancakes I had were fantastic.  The pancakes were light and fluffy, the homemade strawberry syrup was great, as were the fresh strawberries and real whip cream.  My friends were equally pleased with their choices.  A great alternative to the strip buffets, and a step-up from the iHop.  Nothing world shattering, but very good.  I would return."}
{"text":"I do not understand anyone that could give this place less then 5 stars...and the fact that I see it being compared to IHOP and ppl preferring IHOP over this place is crazy!!!  Tey must have ordered the wrong thing or been there on a bad day.  I have been going to this place for years since I moved to Phoenix and it is amazing!  I always get the same thing...the 49er flapjacks with strawberry syrup and whip cream!! YUM YUM YUM!!!!  That is not the only thing I have had though...the famous apple pancake that is more like a dessert then breakfast is still infamous there.  If someone orders one you can smell it from the otherside of the restaurant it is amazing!  I would recommend ordering one and taking it home then warming it up later and putting it with ice cream!!! OMG OMG OMG!! The French crepse are amazing and fabulous as well!  Ron's eggs with the potatoes is fantastic if you do not want a sweet breakfast!  Also, the bisciuts and gravy is out of this world!!  I would say this is one of the best breakfast places in Phoenix!!!  It is very casual you can go there in your workout gear!  I would always plan to wait especially if you go during busy mornings on the weekends!  Crazy crazy crazy!!  I would give up something to be able to eat the 49er flap jacks and apple pancakes everyday!  ITS AMAZING!!! love it!"}
{"text":"It was a disappointing experience. Our order took a very long time to arrive. Tables that were seated long after us were served first. An explanation was not offered. The food was definitely not worth the wait or price. Everything was served cold  except the bacon that arrived after the meal. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love this place, we started calling it our \"breakfast place\".. We are here almost every weekend! The service is great, staff are friendly, enough space for everyone to sit and eat comfortably and the food tastes really close to traditional / your very own home cooked breakfast. Price is reasonable. I love getting their crepes (all flavors are good, seriously!) and my fiancé love their german pancake.. Will definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast for a reasonable price.  Staff was courteous and the place had a good old time atmosphere.   Was actually better in some ways to the egg and I.  As it seemed more country than fast paced packed house style of eating."}
{"text":"Ah.  The reliability of a chain that isn't too chainy.  You know what I mean.  You go to IHOP and you kind of get some smelly booths and those IHOP uniforms... oh sure the pancakes are tasty and they've got a few 24 hour operations but its got a distinctively chain feel.  Now you go to what a friend of mine used to call OHOP (although I now realize that is inaccurate) and the place does a good job of pretending to be a somewhat nicer joe schmoe breakfast diner - IE clean and non smelly booths no matter how many darn kids are in the place.  On the other hand, I've been to a few of the Original House's in Chicagoland and now this one in Charlotte and you have the good parts of being a franchise -the same tasty coffee, the same delicious and slightly yeasty pancakes."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I stopped in on our way to a mini winery day-trip.  It's a clean, busy, bustling place with a classic diner atmosphere... lots of friend/family groups.  I had the mushroom omelet which comes with pancakes.  I took a slight upcharge to make them blueberry pancakes, and I'm SO glad that I did!  The omelet was huge, fluffy, and packed with mushrooms.  The pancakes were also fluffy with big, delicious blueberries throughout... also served with a warm blueberry syrup/compote.  I was not able to eat all of the omelet or pancakes!  For $10, I'm calling this a win!"}
{"text":"The service was super fast. If you're in a rush this is the place is fabulous.  The pancakes were so light and fluffy.  The diced ham and eggs were more like ham chunks and eggs...No cell phones allowed to be on. Pleasant not hear other people's conversations.."}
{"text":"The waitress was a doll. She was so pleasant and sweet. I got potato pancakes with an Irish omelette.  It was amazing!  I substituted the cheddar for gouda cheese, gave it more of a bite. Delicious!  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Always on the the lookout for some good breaky break food, the opportunity to go go OPH came aboot. After coming here, this place has exceeded my expectations, and now there is another very good place for me to go for my breakfast needs.  I've been to other Original Pancake House's in the past. Some items I really didn't like. Others, I thought were pretty good. On my most recent trip, I do believe in saying that, overall, this place makes some pretty good food for the price point.  A few years ago, I went to a different OPH and ordered their signature item, the baked apple pancake. Honestly, while the presentation of the beast was truly amazing, the taste just didn't do it for me. It's not that it tasted bad in any way, but after a few bites, I was done. It was too rich and heavy for my taste buds. I then went to another one and tried their (non-baked) german potato pancakes, and I enjoyed the crispiness of the outer edges of the pancake, and the soft middle. The sour cream and applesauce really heightened the flavor, and it was something I liked.  Now, here is shot #3. This time I ordered the Eggs Michael, because i'm Michael, and I like eggs. This was basically an eggs benedict, but with a sherry mornay sauce instead of the hollandaise, and sausage instead of the ham/bacon. The eggs were poached perfectly, the sherry mornay was nicely made, and the sausage was flavorful. I did think the english muffin was a bit tough, but not that bad. It came with a side of the german potato pancakes that I liked.  I also ordered blueberry pancakes. I'm not a big fan of regular pancakes except for Dupar's, but I wanted to give it a shot. The blueberries complimented the soft, delicate pancake wonderfully, and the side of blueberries to put on top of the pancake was a nice touch. The pancake was light, soft, not tough or chewy, and it wasn't too sweet. This is probably my second favorite pancake after Dupar's.  I would definitely come here again. I think the prices are right on the money, and the quality is pretty good. I'm not a fan of their baked pancakes because they are just too much for me, but i'll happily try any of their other items."}
{"text":"Love everything, the food the building, clean tables. The floors need some help. Servers/ hosts are very nice but a bit too chill at a bussy Friday Lunch time, they could use a bit more training on the service \"by the book, and a bit of common sense\", such as offering a to go box when I have finished less then half of my meal.  Coffee is actually very good, fresh cream! Cups are uncomfortable to drink from."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great service, delicious food, freshly squeezed orange juice, it's my favorite brunch and breakfast place in madison. Delicoius ! Would recommend to my family and friends."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place, hands down in Madison. They have tenured employees, excellent food, and reasonable prices. Downsides: No debit/credit. But it isn't too big a deal. Sure, it could use some touchups, but it is a breakfast place, old school! It keeps the atmosphere of a small diner in check without getting too contemporary and then raising prices 10% to jusitfy it. They rock, hands down."}
{"text":"This place makes me happy, though it's not the best breakfast place. Partly it's that I love the Tahitian Maiden's Dream crepe, which should be an ungodly sweet mess, but somehow is very satisfying nonetheless.  Except on mid-morning weekends, we are always seated promptly. There can be a long-ish wait on weekends, but they do manage the crowds pretty well.   Has lots of options for breakfast: from traditional eggs and such to less common pancake and crepe options. Everything is solid and a bit on the expensive side compared to say, a Waffle House. However it is much cleaner than a Waffle House too, so it may be worth the price differential.  Service has varied pretty widely. We have had super-helpful and friendly waitstaff as well as cranky, indifferent wait staff. They all seem pretty clued-in to serving tables with children, however, which is a big plus.  We live close by and is a place that I will continue to frequent."}
{"text":"Great place. Try the French toast. They have big portions and prices are reasonable. You should stop in and check it out yourself."}
{"text":"The hostess is a rude, crude example of why dealing with the service industry sucks! Cash only? Please, what year is it? The hosted threw mad amounts of attitude to my VERY pregnant friend. Then we didn't even have english speaking wait staff..."}
{"text":"The breakfast food is good. If you visit after 1200 you can pretty much get a seat with no waiting.  The downside is the severs are burnt out from the breakfast crowd so they aren't the friendliest and at times not attentive to your table needs. The older man with the mustache is always at the register. Every time I eat here he is standing there. I figure he is the owner or just a creepy old man that can't be within 500 feet of a school"}
{"text":"Every time i come here i feel like I'm cheating on my dads homemade pancakes but its so worth it, Mostly when i come here i always order the blueberry pancakes, a side of beacon , a glass of water (you;; need it) and a glass of apple juice.. The other times i always order a omelet of any kind but when ordering one please bring a friend to help you eat it.   My friends and i would always go there after class to eat, study and just kick back. The staff is very fun and has tons of energy, Its a great place to go anytime........ So check them out"}
{"text":"Dutch baby- yummmm!!! The hashbrowns are a must... Everything I've ever eaten here has been delicious and the service is great! They constantly walk around and fill your water or drink :) It's our favorite breakfast place! Don't let the wait for a table discourage you!!!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome and so is the service.  We order for carry out and dine in regularly.  Consistently good and the restaurant is kept clean. I feel like this place is ran very well as the staff is always friendly and on point."}
{"text":"Definitely top 3 breakfast spot in Charlotte! Super casual and great for hangovers or after church. Fast and delicious I would suggest this spot 10 times out of 10."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spot for good eggs, Canadian bacon and pancakes. I am a regular in this place especially whenever I have guests. Try the crepes, they are super uber delicious."}
{"text":"i guess this place is pretty good. i'm not sure i'm head-over-heels about it like everyone else is.  the first time i went there, i got one of those 4-egg omelettes that they oven bake.  i was definitely not too keen on it.  yes, it was huge and yes, you could feed an army with it, but i felt like it was overdone 'cuz the crispy burnt outside really distracted from the eggy, hammy goodness on the inside that i wanted to taste.  i actually had avoided going back since then because usually when i brunch i go the omelette route but.. . .  i went back recently for a friend's birthday, however, and tried the combo plate.  i liked that this option existed since it was just 1 egg (cooked however you want it), 1 sausage patty (or whatever meat option) and 3 buttermilk pancakes.  it was like i got to have all the different foods but in smaller portions so that i could actually eat it all.  a friend got potato pancakes with his eggs benedict which looked awesome!   i'm not sure how you can go wrong with thin fried crispy slivers of mashed potatoes though.  the eggs benedict themselves actually didn't look that great and honestly made me just yearn for the amazing eggs benedict at cafe continental.  the wait was 45 minutes at noon on sunday.  yes, it's the sunday brunch crowd, but that's quite a wait.   i'm hungry and i'm hungry now.  one point off for the wait. one point off for the omelette.  one point for extensive menu. one point for good combo plate and those potato pancake things. one point for good service.  you have won me back for now, original pancake house. don't let me down."}
{"text":"Pancakes, crepes, potato pancakes, hashbrowns, coffee, old fashioned oat meal.. There's so much to choose from and I can never settle on just one thing! I ALWAYS end up ordering WAY too much food at the original pancake house. It's all so delicious. I'm a big fan of the plain crepes and the chocolate chip pancakes. I get one of these dishes every time. The oat meal is really tasty, too. It's thick and hearty, not watery at all. The hashbrowns are the best in town, in my opinion. Chunks of potatoes and onions and yummy seasoning. If you're planning on arriving after 9am on a saturday or sunday be prepared to wait. They move people in and out pretty quickly, though! I've never had to wait very long for my food to arrive at the table and truthfuly, it gets inhaled pretty quickly because it's just so tasty!"}
{"text":"Came in to just have a good dinner, but instead i had an amazing dinner with a great service. First, the omelet I had is so delicious. Second, you can change up your omelet, by meaning, you can add extra food in it , great atmosphere and the staff is friendly and proffesional. We are fron NY, so we are used to get a good service, so GUYS if you are looking for a great breakfast with a great service, then this is the PLACE FOR YOU. People left low star reviews just because the omelet were a little too big for them, if the omelets atre too big for you, then take whatever is left home. Its better if you had a big omelet than getting too small, so PEOPLE DO NOT BELIEVE the reviews, just come in and try!"}
{"text":"Not really a huge fan. I'll just state that up front. Will I return? Possibly. Will I go out of my way to get here for breakfast again? Nope.  Firstly, I really dislike when places serve a single waffle as a breakfast meal. Who in the flip eats just a waffle? No bacon. No eggs. Just one single waffle. Everything on their a la carte menu was insanely priced, too. We'd have been better off just going to dine on the strip!   So I ended up ordering the waffle and another meal, the traditional, that included the eggs, potatoes and sausage (or choice of bacon) that I wanted.   The waffle came on a plate, by itself, no powdered sugar or anything. Sorry if I am a bit repetitive, I order waffles at breakfast establishments often and I've never seen such a bland looking waffle, LOL. The traditional meal was alright. Eggs, sausage and toast you can't really screw up too bad. Everything was cooked how it should've been. I will note that they don't really try anything clever on their menu. The potatoes though... they were cooked \"German style\" which I had never really heard of. They were.. interesting. I do wish that they'd have been a little crisper... but they weren't all that bad in the end.   If you go, I recommend that you get pancakes or French toast... better value, to me at least."}
{"text":"I come here with my dad every so often for the past 20 something years and it is a true champaign gem."}
{"text":"The pancakes and hot chocolate here are so good but it's too fattening so I only come 2-4 times a year."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food is consistently good, and no matter how busy they are, the staff is always friendly and fast. I've been coming here for years, and to be honest, there really hasn't been much staff turnover there whatsoever. I think that speaks volumes about what it's like to work there.   If you come on Sunday mornings after 9:00, expect to wait for a bit. But it's worth it.   Portions are pretty big, so come if you're hungry, but bring cash as they don't take cards."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is they always cook my scrambled eggs  perfect as I order. Love the Dutch Baby!! and the potato pancakes just as good.  Really disappointed the station casinos closed their locations.   Alway worth the drive to decatur."}
{"text":"People!!! They take debit cards now, so you can continue on with your fear of cash money. I love the retro feel of this place. The dining area is a tight squeeze so leave your claustrophobia at the door. The dutch baby is yum and their omelettes are fluffy and delicious. If you don't want to wait, I suggest coming on a weekday, it's pretty mellow then."}
{"text":"Wonderful busy breakfast place. Love the fresh OJ that is for sure fresh squeezed. This place is referred by my friend so come to check out their Dutch baby. It actually tastes better than expected, very eggy and the sweetness is just in right amount. Will come back to try other dishes as well. Moreover, server greets in time n being very friendly. Service is in normal level in the breakfast place."}
{"text":"Don't care what anybody says, this place has the best breakfast in town.  The portions are generous and you can choose from full or half.  I usually order the Ron's Southwest Special with potato pancakes and it is scrumptious.  And I cannot leave there without a fresh strawberry crepe.  Unbelievably delicious.  The crepes melt in your mouth and no canned or frozen yuk either - just fresh juicy sliced strawberries with a side of their homemade strawberry syrup.  It is a refreshing treat to eat food that has a real genuine flavor, doesn't get thawed, dumped out of a can and doesn't taste like cardboard.  This is our favorite place anytime.  Ron, the manager, is super nice and so are the servers.  I've been a fan since 1994 and will continue to be so."}
{"text":"Today I strayed from my apple pancake and got the banana crepes. DAYYYUM!!! They were stuffed with sour cream and bananas and topped with an apricot glaze. Phenomenal! My husband was more than pleased with his 7 strips of bacon, divine pancakes( I won't say how many) and 3 eggs."}
{"text":"Always go here for breakfast when I am in town. Their omelets are the best I have ever had.  Personally I always get the Western Omelet.  On the weekends expect to wait about 30-40 min in the morning.  Arrive Sat or Sunday an hour before they close (1PM) and get seated right away.  The restaurant is very plain, so come for the food and food only.    5 stars on food, 3 stars on atmosphere.  Bring Cash."}
{"text":"Yum!!! I LOVE the Tahitian Maiden's Dream crepes here. They have extra thick bacon (very difficult to get it extra crispy- but it's really good anyway). I've had breakfast and dinner here and it's good any time of day. Long wait on weekend mornings but it's pretty tolerable. They have Creative Loafing nearby to peruse while waiting."}
{"text":"The Original Pancake House (OPH) is my 2nd favorite place for breakfast on the weekends (Pewter Rose is the first).  And they're one of the few Charlotte brunch options that opens before 10 a.m.  They offer an extensive menu of breakfast selections, including eggs, waffles, and, of course, pancakes.    Since I'm usually an egg person for breakfast, I'm usually steered past the pancakes and waffles and go right for the omelettes or other egg dishes.  Their omelettes are HUGE.  They seem like they're made from like 18 eggs or something.  None of the omelettes really seem to have a lot inside them (the ingredients aren't overflowing), but my favorite is the sausage one.  Also tasty are their seafood crepes and Eggs Michael (Eggs Benedict with sausage instead of Canadian bacon), as well as their regular Eggs Benedict.  And, last but not least, there's the Kosher meal:  eggs with salami and potato pancakes on the side.  YUM!  I'm not Jewish, but I do love a good Kosher breakfast!  (Miami has an awesome Jewish breakfast place, too, but I draw the line at \"tongue.\")  Potato pancakes are a delicious treat -- more tasty than hashbrowns, but not as filling as regular pancakes.    This location of the OPH is fairly new (in the past couple of years).  They moved from South Blvd where there was little parking...to a place where there's even less.  Go figure.  And I'm not crazy about the big open space of the \"new\" restaurant.  I want OPH to feel more like a diner.  I guess that's part of my reasoning for only 4 stars instead of 5.    If you go on Sundays, be sure to get there before the church crowd!  Or you're looking at about an hour wait."}

This particular location of the OPH is across the street from the high-end SouthPark Mall, so you think it would be a little more stylish, but it's got that old 80s restaurant feel to it.  A renovation in decorating is definitely needed.  OPH should feel (and look) more like a diner.  I guess that's part of my reasoning for only 4 stars instead of 5.    If you go on Sundays, be sure to get there before the church crowd!  Or you're looking at about an hour wait."}
{"text":"The take-out time for a to-go order at 1:30 on a weekday was extremely slow, and the $12 veggie omelet price threw me a bit, but the omelet was HUGE.  Huge, as in 3 lbs at least.  Definitely enough for 2 or more meals.  The fillings (spinach, tomato, broccoli, etc.) were great and the center of the eggs were light and airy and perfect.  Unfortunately, every time I've gotten an omelet here, the outside of the omelet is brown.  That's not great execution.    Also the omelet came with a side of pancakes, which I wasn't expecting.  I guess that was the reason for the $12 price.  It would've been helpful for my diet and willpower to know this in advance so I could tell them not to include.  I'm not sure what part of veggie egg white omelet no cheese extra veggies low oil made them think that pancakes as a side were desirable, but maybe that was my fault for not seeing it on the menu."}
{"text":"Yum. We love this place. It's exactly like the one in Royal Oak MI... I guess I never knew it was a chain! The omelets are awesome!! They are absolutely huge, you could probably split it with someone if you wanted. It nice and fluffy (I think because they bake it?) I recommend the veggie one, very good !  The bulgar wheat pancakes rock! I know what your thinking.....but I swear they kick ass and they are good for you (kind of ;)) This place totally owns IHOP! You have to check it out!  Can't wait to try the french toast you are all raving about. I love the omelets so much I have a hard time trying anything else!"}
{"text":"On my 2nd and final day in Champaign, my bro and I decided on this gem! He had been here before, and he thought it was good, and he was correct!  I'm actually going to start with my gripes, which is why this place isn't 5 star. First off, they are a chain, but their menu online does not match their restaurant menu. Let's get on the same page here! Make a PDF and make my life easier! (I wanted some buckwheat/wheat germ pancakes, but alas, they did not have them). Another gripe of mine is that their omelettes only come with pancakes on the side. No hashbrowns or fruit, unless you'd like to pay extra. I know that they give 3 pancakes on the side, but they aren't that big. Add another side option!!!! Finally, I was a bit disappointed in the filling and topping selection for my omelette. No avocado or salsa? I can understand one, but both? COME ON! Finally, as I can see in a few other reviews, they don't really offer anything for the gluten free crowd. Not a big deal to us, but just saying.  We arrived to the very crowded restaurant around 1220 on a sunday. This place was a zoo! I actually had no idea so many non-college students were in the area, although the sign that read, \"Champaign, 67000\" should have given me a clue. we were told the wait would be 15-20 mins, and it was exactly that.  My brother and I are breakfast/pizza snobs, and we're not ashamed of it either. We both ordered omelettes; mine was a veggie with egg beaters and cheese, his was the western with eggs. We both got our own cakes. He got the bacon pancakes (he is actually the more savory bro), and I ordered bran pancakes, which were oat bran, nuts, yogurt and strawberries (in the batter).  I was very pleased with the food, even with my gripes (see above). we are both pains in the asses when we order, because we used to be fat, but now we specialize  The omelettes are oven-baked, and they are amazing!!!! The pancakes were good, but spectacular. If I'm heading back here, I'm going for the omelette!  The staff was very nice, and some of them were very attractive as well. CALL ME!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to get pancakes, the bacon is delicious and eggs are always cooked to perfection, love having breakfast with my Yb husband here the staff is amazing nice and constant love it here"}
{"text":"We always have a good breakfast here and we go on a regular basis.    We saw a story on The Original Pancake House on the Food Network and apparently the staff arrive at the establishment very early to start making food from scratch (pancake batter, etc.) so we figured that would make for a good breaky and we were right.  I love their banana pancakes and my husband always enjoys his omelet of choice.  The staff is always friendly and eager to please and it's always the same faces around there.  Like that!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times now.  On this particular location, I was meeting a friend for lunch on a Monday.  It was busy but not unbearable.  The parking lot was tight, but not an indication of what was happening inside.  \"Two please\" and we were seated in quick passion.  I ordered up a German pancake along with a side of bacon, coffee and a water.  The pancake came out in a manner I was not ordinary accustomed to reviewing.  It was much like a Hungarian breakfast cake my GF has made for me.  The fixings were like another another breakfast place I had been to in the past. There was syrup, butter and squeeze of lemon. Thank God, the GF does not charge the price I paid for the pancake.  That being said, it was tasty.  Bacon was good.  The service was not as I would have like it, but I get it.  There were a lot of other bodies dining.  Coffee ran cold at times but again, I am not sweating.    The check came and was paid.  I asked the waitress if it was cook if we hung out.  She said it was fine.   I bit of drive for me,but if you live on this side of town...it's a solid place to have a meal to start you day."}
{"text":"This is a must for pancakes. My husband loves the strawberry pancakes and I'm a fan of the 49ers and potato pancakes. No frills just good food."}
{"text":"I come here  after late night church lock-ins with my small group. For the purposes, OHOP works out beautifully for us. Free coffee? Oh yes. A wait for omelettes and pancakes? Not so great, especially with grumpy old people staring at you because you're a minority. Awesome. Seriously though, the food's greasy but delicious. That guilty sort of lovely. I recommend the Swedish pancakes. Don't be fooled by the whipped butter, I thought it was whipped cream initially. It is not."}
{"text":"No credit cards or ATM? Awful tease. Get with the times"}
{"text":"We got there around 10 am on Sunday.   We were seated right away and got a booth.  Our waitress was most delightful.  Her name was Jessica--super sweet and attentive.   Food came out right away.  We got apple pancake and a crape. Portions were large.   When we were leaving, the place was quite crowded and there was a wait."}
{"text":"Some of the best pancakes in town! So buttery and fluffy. This place is so packed on the weekends, so the best time would be the weekdays. The space is a bit small, but the service and food makes up for it. Oh and be careful about parking too. Small lot."}
{"text":"Always a family favorite! I bring all my friends here when they come to visit and OPH never disappoints! The western omelette and 49'ers are to die for"}
{"text":"I generally prefer more of a greasy spoon or a diner experience for breakfasts but you cant deny that this is a very good place.  Service is always good and the bathrooms are always clean.  Try the fresh squeezed orange juice."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I visit my boyfriend in Champaign and we are always trying to find new places to eat breakfast.  You get your money's worth here.  I got the massive hot chocolate and Farmers Scramble with jalapeños.  Everything comes with 3 pancakes.  So much food but so good!! The waitress was super attentive and friendly.  We will definitely be back since we wanted to try everything on the menu and couldn't decide what to get."}
{"text":"Great variety to choose from. My daughter and I shared the potato pancakes and an order of the country ham and eggs. Everything was delicious and the service was great."}
{"text":"Went here this morning with relatives (15 of us total and the staff was very accommodating and friendly.  The atmosphere was great as well.  The biscuits and gravy were great as was the coffee but the eggs left something to be desired and the orange juice was a bit too sweet for my taste.  The prices were a bit much and the portions were huge.  This would be fine if I thought I could reheat and eat later but breakfast food doesn't heat very well so a lot of my dish was wasted which I hate doing.  Overall this is a good place to get breakfast but there is room for improvement."}
{"text":"Whenever we are on the road and we find an Original Pancake House in town, we just have to stop in for breakfast.  It's all about the Dutch baby pancake, which is indescribably fluffy with just a little bit of chew to it--like a marriage between a crepe and Yorkshire pudding.  It comes with butter, lemon, and a little dish of powdered sugar.  If that is not enough to top it, they bring you warmed syrup as well.  Always a solid hit."}
{"text":"There is always a wait for weekend brunch, but for very good reason.  The food is cheap and fantastic!  The service is always very friendly as well and the food is prepared quickly once you do get seated.  I typically get something classic like the bacon and egg breakfast which also comes with fluffy pancakes.  And I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't be daunted by the menu, keep looking and you will find any breakfast food or combination of foods that you want. The prices look steep, but the potions are huge. Plus, there is always a to-go box upon request and a bottomless cup of coffee. I've eaten here five or so times and have always left full of delicious breakfast food that I didn't have to cook!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure the potatoe ~hashbrowns  are Amazing don't miss out I eat here weekly"}
{"text":"OMG!  I thought I was an IHop lover of pancakes....sorry IHop you have just been beat! I can't beging to tell you how much I enjoy dining there! I have the almond pancakes and they are to DIE FOR! Not heavy pancake, sometimes they tend to be just too heavy.  Not here! The omelet my husband gets is big enough for two! The service is always Great as well!"}
{"text":"Too busy to place a take out order is what i was told by an employee. Update your website and indicate that take out orders are not available. Im glad Ihop was available to take my order"}
{"text":"This place is the best.   The restaurant is clean and comfortable. The atmosphere is pretty active, but they have booths lining the walls that give you a bit more shelter and privacy. During the winter, request a table away from the doorway as they are really busy and the door opening and closing creates a draft that isn't very pleasant.   Anyway - we've gone to various Original Pancake houses for the last 8 years, and this one is our favorite. Their staff are consistently good at what they do, providing personal service and staying attentive, even when it is obvious that they are slammed. Some of our favorite servers are Yvette (who remembered our orders even if it was a month or two since our last visit!) and Dino, who was always helpful and great.   The atmosphere and service provide the perfect foundation for the best basic, homemade breakfast food in the universe. Their menu is huge - loads of different pancake options, omelets, benedicts, waffles, french toast, and CREPES, plus some lunch stuff. I. LOVE. THEIR. CREPES. Seriously the only breakfast place I've been to that makes them so perfectly. Their strawberry crepes are good, but pretty sweet. I usually get the \"Shells\" which are their plain crepes with a little powdered sugar and then I get a side of strawberry syrup (which is not syrupy stickiness - it is a housemade fresh strawberry puree) SUPER GOOD.   Other favorites are the 49er flapjacks, challah french toast, Strawberry Pancakes, Corned Beef Hash (served with poached eggs and dee-licious potato pancakes) even their basic scrambled eggs are incredibly tasty, as are their meats: sausage patties are flavorful and perfectly crispy, the bacon is thick cut and addictive.  I don't love their orange juice (too pulpy for me), their coffee is good and their hot cocoa is just the ticket on a cold day - they use milk instead of water and top it with thick, real whipped cream that is not out of a can ... can't get better than that!   The prices are higher than a fast food place but cheaper than the strip.   I've been to lots of Original Pancake locations- 4 or 5 in California, 2 in Wisconsin, 1 in Florida, 1 in Arizona, and all of the Las Vegas locations are THE. BEST. The Freudenberger group runs the Las Vegas franchises and they do a top notch job without all of the weird idiosyncrasies that many of the other locations seem to have.  I'm so sad that I'm 6 hours away from my favorite breakfast spot. I would eat at the Original Pancake every day if I could.  Go, and have some crepes for me :)"}
{"text":"I love the Original Pancake House. This one is super weird, but less weird than it was once upon a time.   My first visit was probably 5-7 years ago. They had a multitude of signs plastered on the door and in the entry \"NO CELL PHONES\" \"CASH ONLY\" \"WE DON'T LIKE YOU\" (I made that last one up, the first two are for reals) They didn't have half of the things I was used to ordering at Original Pancake Houses elsewhere and they had *gasp* bad bacon (cardinal sin for any breakfast place) Additionally, the beverage situation was bizarre... like, I ordered a Diet Coke, hubs ordered a regular Coke, and they came in aluminum cans - one Diet Coke, one regular ... Pepsi? Service was gruff. The orangey/bluey/turqoisey tackiness of the decor made my eyes hurt.   Fast forward to my experience 2 weekends ago... still lots of signs on the door, but I had called ahead to verify and although there is a sign that it is cash only and an ATM just inside, they actually DO take credit cards now, thank goodness. I think there may have been a no cell phones sign, but it doesn't seem as strictly policed (I was able to check in on Yelp and take my obligatory food photos) They even sat our incomplete party --- craziness! It was great. The birthday girl was running a little behind, so we were able to grab a table so that we were ready for her. We were visiting on a Saturday, so I expected a wait and bustling busyness, but while there were other patrons around, it was not jam packed and there was no wait for a table or service. Our server was pretty nice - not bubbly but not grumpy.   The menu seems to have improved - they had plenty of strawberry treats (my go-to choices) and I ordered plain crepes with delicious strawberry syrup. On my last visit, the only syrup option for my crepes was \"tropical\", so I was very pleased with the current situation. Delicious bacon, plus some yummy pancakes, Strawberry Crepes, and Eggs Michael rounded out our orders. Great reviews all around. The beverage service has progressed to normal fountain drinks, which was much nicer than my past experience.  The oddly shaped table was a bit strange (we were on a banquette in a corner and 2 out of the 5 people in our group sat a little awkwardly on corners of the table) and the super tacky decor still hurt my eyes, but overall the place is clean, bright, and generally welcoming.   I will definitely visit again (sooner than 5-7 years from now, I hope) and look forward to more of the breakfast-y wonderfulness I've come to expect from my favorite Original Pancake House locations."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. I heard really good things about this place. My fiancé and I went in, we didn't even get a chance to look at the menu and the waiter asked us what we would like to drink so we asked for water until we could decide. The guy leaves and brings back our waters slams them on the table and walks away. See I'm use to this kind of service when I don't do my hair and I look like some punk kid, waiters think I don't tip but it's the opposite cause I work as a bartender so I always tip. He took our order brought our food out and I got bacon instead of the sausage I ordered. I didn't say anything cause people make mistakes. But my fiancee asked for the sausage instead. He looked at the ticket and asked himself if it was his fault or the kitchens. Of course the ticket didn't say the details so instead of apologizing he went and brought out the sausage. We also noticed he was striking a conversation with every other table but not us. Once again thats fine. But you can be polite."}
{"text":"Fresh whipped butter makes everything better...It might not be frrsly whipped but it sure tastes like it. The butter is yimmy on the pancakes with the very warm syrup and the grits are delicious with this whipped butter. Ordered the spinach omelette which was gluffyand had a good amount of spinach and sauteed onions, nice flavor and texture. The service from hostess and out waitress, Esther, was very good. They were friendly, welcoming and professional.  The coffee also had a good flavor and aroma.  The dining area is very bright and cheerful. The parking lot is a little cramped. And the temperature was a little cold, dont think the thermostat was expecting this 40° day."}
{"text":"Healthy sourdough pancakes and a Spanish omelette plenty to share or take home.... The Spanish omelette was loaded with  mushrooms and covered in  a tomato sauce loaded with olives. The fresh squeeze orange juice is refreshing.  The butter and warm syrup were great on the pancakes. Great service all around the place."}
{"text":"All I can say is \"Oh My God\". The menu...extensive. Food...great. Coffee...fabulous. I had the \"Dutch baby\" which was just great. Tried a little of everyone else's food and all was outstanding.  My waitress, Abby, was terrific. We need one of these in Fayetteville."}
{"text":"Good food. Long lines. Worth the wait! The pancakes are really good however don't order the apple pancake. It takes 20-25 minutes to cook and it wasn't all that. Please save your time and money. Pet peeve- warm syrup wasn't warm!!! We asked for warm syrup twice and it wasn't warm at all. Who wants to eat hot food with cold syrup?"}
{"text":"I come here pretty often.  They always have great customer service which keeps me coming back. The food and portions are great for the price."}
{"text":"This is one of the awesome breakfast joints in Madison.  If you love pancakes, you will be ecstatic over this joint which offers about 50 varieties of the fluffy doughy disc-shaped treats.  Very crowded with suburban families on the weekends, so be prepared for a possible lengthy wait.  Its worth it though.  Better yet, skip classes on weekday mornings to enjoy without the crowds and kids."}
{"text":"Best breakfast around!  Try the pumpkin pancakes for Fall...and/or the crepes! Ooh La La!"}
{"text":"Big operation but small business feel . Arrive before they open or within ten minutes or expect to wait . Pricey for breakfast food but worth it once in a while ."}
{"text":"i am shocked by any bad reviews of this place and i urge anyone who had a bad experience to give 'em another shot! i have seen this tiny place tucked on the side of Camelback for sometime but wasn't impressed with its exterior enough to venture in but boy, was i missing out! these pancakes will knock your socks off; every cake i've tried has taken me to taste -bud heaven. i'm usually not a fan of the richness in chocolate chip pancakes but for some reason The Original Pancake House makes them so divine, i typically order them... but it's not without a thoughtful internal argument since everything looks and tastes really flippin' good.   i feel sorry for anyone letting the minor \"rules\" that they ask that you turn off your cell (AS COURTESY to your server and other patrons) and that they are a cash-only establishment get in the way of enjoying super tasty pancakes. but i'm glad some people keep away - it means more for me!"}
{"text":"I used to like The Pancake House for their huge menu, amazing options, great service and good coffee and that fresh OJ.  Then I got the Dutch Baby.....and I don't even look at the extensive menu anymore.    Show me a place in Madison, that doesn't have screaming kids and a long wait on the weekends, and I'll show you a miracle!  Expect to wait for your breakfast on weekends....it's a given.    If you don't like what you ordered, order something different the next time - their menu is HUGE!  We have never been disappointed, and always bring out of towners here to eat - my mom starts to request her Dutch Baby as soon as she hits state lines.    TIP: once the wait was 45 minutes, and we were all starving and tired and we asked the host desk for coffee while we waited and they happily obliged...coffee makes any wait easier!!"}
{"text":"My pick for #1 in breakfast. eggworks/egg and I is #2. I still have not tried dutch baby (sounds like too much sugar, I'm a meat lover) and always opt for gouda on my omelettes (it's awesome). Fresh tasty coffee, insanely good OJ,but expensive.  I wish this place was open at night so I can get my evening breakfast fix on. Their pancakes are really fluffy and wonderful, I don't give a damn if it doesn't come with REAL maple syrup-still awesome, and I always will favor this place."}
{"text":"I'm with Michael on this place.  I don't get the adoration of this place.  It's always packed.  People fall all over themselves to praise these cash-only schmucks.   So who the eff cares that this place is cash only?  I do.   Restaurants like this stick out like a sore thumb in Phoenix. I hardly ever carry cash.  I know.  Bad habit.  But, please Original Pancake House, buy a flippin credit card merchant machine thing and raise your prices on everything by 75 cents.  It's really inconvenient. Luckily there are many other breakfast places who accept debit/credit cards in the immediate area (Over Easy, Orange Table, etc.).  I don't care for pancakes (so I'm no expert on them) but I usually order the chorizo scramble here and give my pancakes to my dining partner. Good egg to chorizo ratio on the scramble.  Very quick service once you're seated, but the wait can be long on occasion.  It's all good though, because during your wait you can marvel and analyze the uber-60s architecture of the interior."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the Original Pancake House, on the recommendation of one of my friends who tried it on a recent visit to Charlotte. She said that it was really good and the omelets were unbelievable. Mmmmm....omelets!   So in we went, on Sunday afternoon....surprised that the wait was not very long at all! Our waitress greeted us right away and gave us menus to review.   I already knew what I wanted, I was a little disappointed that there was no \"build your own option\" on the omelet menu. I mean don't get me wrong they had some pretty awesome choices Western, Veggie, Ham and Bacon but none that you could customize on your own. Oh well.... I customized my ordered and chose a ham omelet, add spinach and cheese.   My mouth was watering as all the entrees came flying out the kitchen! I could hardly wait, our waitress brought our a plate with some butter and syrup and then it was time to dig in!  My omelet was huge! It's a four egg omelet....I mean does it get much better than that??? It was hot and cheesy! And they did not skimp on the toppings! Every bite had some ham, and spinach...so that was awesome! The pancakes were light and fluffy and just simply delicious!  Everything with this place was totally right, look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"The quality of food and service here is good compared to other places. When you walk in you get the immediate feeling of good home cooking with the warm welcomes and the smell of bacon, eggs, flour and coffee.   I've only been here twice. I haven't tried any of their pancake dishes, which are the most popular there, but my favorite is the belgium waffles with a side of bacon and a glass of their fresh squeezed orange juice! NOM NOM NOM. The price is decent compared to the quality and serving sizes, but would def recommend this place to people visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"All the foods look good as they are coming out to the tables, I decided to try their special Sausage Patti and eggs...What a mistake, I would be embarrassed to serve it , let alone eat it...you see the great pictures of bacon etc,, Two link sausage or one patti, I was expecting something great.. When delivered it was smaller than a silver dollar, and about as thin...Im sure it was a boxed, frozen patti.....NEVER BUY IT......"}
{"text":"Food is amazing - highly recommend the apple pancake - as is the service. I've always wanted to visit one of these, and I wasn't disappointed. If you're in Vegas, it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place ever! Always leave full and with leftovers. I've been several times now and have tried different things every time. I've never been disappointed. Definitely get the large fresh squeezed oj. Such a treat!"}
{"text":"Swedish pancakes, yum! ..I am one of a lot of regular patrons -- classic, local diner feel with great food."}
{"text":"Great service tonight as usual. The menu is the same but the food seems to get better anytime. For little $ you great a grand meal with a side of home made whipped cream."}
{"text":"The people are nice, the place is clean, and the food is great! Have never had an unpleasant morning there, and always look forward to being able to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST pancakes I've ever eaten. The place is immaculate and the waitstaff are always attentive and very friendly. Your coffee cup will never go empty. The buttermilk pancakes are light and fluffy. Even whe there is a wait - the line goes fast. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Apple pancake for me and strawberry crepe when in season for my fiance. a couple times I had to have them take it back for the fact that my pancake was burnt. so now I always check my food. the orange juice I mix with grapefruit taste fresh squeezed. overall a slightly better than Ihop"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to eating here this morning, then everything went wrong. We were not seated when tables were available, since they were being saved for future larger groups who had not even put their name down, let alone arrived yet. I would have appreciated myself and my pregnant wife being able to sit down and eat. Strike one. The restaurant seemed to not have a problem with a lady bringing her toy dog in with her and feeding it a plate of eggs under the table. Strike two. The eggs Michael, usually pretty good and what we went for, had only mushrooms and flour in the sauce, nothing else, when it is supposed to have sherry for the flavor. Strike three. This restaurant does not even get close to meeting expectations. Don't go here based on the name alone and waste your time - Phoenix has much better breakfasts to offer."}
{"text":"I get a craving for the 49er flapjacks every 3 years or so  and I took the family for brunch today.  We went early to avoid the wait but ended up hanging out for 15 minutes anyway.  I don't, as a rule, wait but I really wanted those flapjacks!  We were taken to our table by a hostess who almost didn't seat us because my brother was in the restroom.  I had to tell her where he was...kinda ridiculous.    We were famished and ordered coffee, pancakes, corned beef hash, eggs, and a few other goodies.  Our water and coffee were never less than half-full, our waitress was reall nice, and we walked out with leftovers.  So I struggle with rating this place.  The service was good once we were seated.  The flapjacks are really good.  The coffee was too.  They take credit cards now, which is a plus.   The hash was dry and grainy and we took it home JUST because it was 5.95.  The eggs and hash browns weren't wonderful either .  All in all, it wasn't a horrible experience but I have an aversion to traveling, waiting, and explaining where one of our party is just to have food that is average.  See you in 3 years UNLESS I learn how to make them myself."}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast! Great service- a little pricey, but worth every penny. The coffee is delicious- my favorite are the cinnamon oatmeal raisin pancakes!"}
{"text":"Besides getting hot coco instead of chocolate milk, everything else was pretty solid! It's not the type of fancy or trendy breakfast place you'd expect to see in these parts of Scottsdale. But it is a classic breakfast place with lots of options - feels like an old-timey mom and pop place. The wait staff were kind and quick, the food was good, overall an enjoyable experience if your just wanting a solid breakfast and not expecting to be wow'd. It's a the perfect place to take your folks or grandparents. And everyone would have a good time."}
{"text":"I've made many trips here for breakfast; you'll have a wait on the weekends but the food is worth it.  Prepared well and large portions.  Highly recommended.....oh, by the way, no credit cards accepted!"}
{"text":"Great food! Clean. Basic. Friendly staff and reasonably priced. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"The pancakes are so fluffy! Really loved this place for an early morning breakfast. The eggs & bacon were also fab. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star, I would. While the food was good, the service was horrendous. After waiting 15 minutes for someone to greet us, it took over 45 minutes to get anything more than water. The managers did not seem to care, the waitress (Julie) was rude and defensive, and when we addressed the issue we were dismissed without apology. I do not recommend this location for anyone who wants to eat a meal at a semi-normal pace."}
{"text":"I really do like the OG pancake house!! Me and my soon to be babies daddy went for breakfast after our DR. apt the other day (our after Dr. ritual).  We were seated right away, and them greeted right away; a huge plus for me.  My man had never been there so he took some time to peruse the menu.  I made some suggestions as we looked.  I was craving apple flavor, so I quickly choose the apple waffle.  There is fresh apples  actually baked in the batter, YUMMY!  I also opted to have German style breakfast potatoes.  When the server came back to take our order, my man decided to go with my recommendation and get the bacon pancakes (he LOVES bacon), he also got sausage patties .  So we sat and chatted while we waited. The meal came quickly, but before it hit the table the server had brought all the sauces and such, another huge plus!  My waffle was outstanding!!!  Fresh hot apples and cinnamon coated the moist, fluffy waffle.  I ate the whole thing!  Not hard when you are 5 1/2 months pregos!  The potatoes were good, not the best but good.  Just as I suspected the bacon pancakes disappeared quickly as well.  The only complaint I had was the sausage patties we got were small  and we got 2 for $4.39.  Not a good value compared to the rest of the meal.  All together with tip a 20% tip was $28.00.  A great meal, great service and a happy pregnant woman, which makes a happy man.  I will defiantly be going there again to have another one of their great flavored waffles or pancakes.   PS if you dont want pancakes or waffles there are egg and other choices for you."}
{"text":"Probably the best spots for breakfast. Everything is delicious and the portions are large and filling, just a bit pricey than most. And this place on the weekends will be hopping & packed.  Food comes out hot and well cooked. Would recommend when the craving for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? I have been to an orginal pancake house in California which was nice and had very good food. This one however I think was the very first original pancake house because the decor was horrible and dirty. We decided to still try it and the food was not good at all. I don't know how u really can really manage to mess u breakfast entrees but they did."}
{"text":"Its been mentioned several times that this place is very, very busy and there is a wait.  I do agree with that but I found the wait to be very quick (20 minutes is fast in my book for a popular restaurant at peak hours).  I love that they have coffee for you while you wait.  To me, the Original Pancake house is like IHop+.  Its liked the upgraded, more attractive sister of IHop.  I ordered the egg, cheese, biscuit and gravy dish (can't recall name) and a side blueberry pancake.  Food was brought out quick (which was pretty impressive based on how busy it was).   It was a MASSIVE amount of food. I got about 1/2 way through my main plate before I called it quits.  Pancake was simple but tasty.  The syrup was blueberry syrup with actual blueberries in it (which I liked).  I can see why this place is a staple in Champaign.  Although the waitress advised us to just take our tickets to the front register, before we could a host came to our table and ran our tabs. This extra effort was very nice especially considering how packed they were."}
{"text":"Got seated instantly on a Saturday morning around 10:30 AM.  Yeah, it was the middle of June and the college kids are away, but the restaurant was crowded and I was expecting a fifteen minute wait for a table.  I found the service to be prompt and friendly once we were seated.   Clearly, the staff is used to managing crowds.  The menu is a bit overwhelming, but not too extreme.  I appreciated the mix of breakfast staples and unique offerings.   Overall, the food was good and, like most breakfast places, the portions were enormous.   My advice:  order a small plate!"}
{"text":"This may not be a likely breakfast winner, but they serve a yummy German pancake, so this is a 5 star spot in my book.   If you've never had a German pancake, you should order one! It's like a huge skillet size popover that comes with butter, lemons and powdered sugar to create your own glaze. It's nothing like a traditional pancake, but it's soooo good. German pancakes are quite the chore to make on your own, so it's worth making a trip to the Original Pancake House to try one.   We get breakfast to-go here at least once a month and it's always good."}
{"text":"Mmmmm!!! This place is so good!!! The pecan waffle with the special syrup was amazing! My husband got the philly omelette and it was huge and cheesy and absolutely yummy!! Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"The best pancakes around town!!! Love the bacon too! Thick crispy and lovely! My go to stop in Vegas."}
{"text":"Always a line here but the food is worth the wait! I die for the blueberry pancakes and my husband loves the \"Dutch Baby.\" My only gripe is they only take cash and I am a hardcore debit gal. Excellent breakfast and terrific prices."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful location for breakfast, brunch, or lunch on those post-college party mid-mornings. The orange juice here is amazing, and it is a particular joy for me to drink it here. Their combination waffle/pancakes are rather pricey, but among the best I've ever tasted.  For those who care to glorify their breakfasts, this is the place to be. As will I, when I'm tired of eating pop-tarts, and decide to make the 4-mile trek"}
{"text":"It's a classic. Don't go if you are in a rush or looking for healthy food. This is  a traditional pancake house - no bells and whistles, just good breakfast."}
{"text":"Breakfast, you always speak to my heart and my stomach. Like I've said before, this is the best meal of the day. Restaurants that serve breakfast all day should be given an award for awesomeness. I came here with a friend for brunch during the week and we both ordered the chorizo omelette. With an omelette you get a side of pancakes (3), hashbrowns, or fresh fruit. We decided to upgrade to the pumpkin pancakes and I added pecans to mine. I also had an Earl Grey tea. I don't even really like eggs, but this omelette was delicious. It had chorizo, pork crumbles, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and a ton of cheese. It also came with sour cream and \"Spanish sauce\" which was like a really hearty salsa. The pancakes were served with whipped cream and syrup. I never tasted the nuts which were the only thing I would change.   Be aware of the construction going on around the block that contains the OPH. I passed the entrance 3 times."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food at OPH.  Had the Belgin Waffles with a side of bacon.  The bacon was thick & delicious.  Ok, I don't get bacon often.  The Belgin Waffle was light and had a good taste.  If you are a grandparent or grandchild (55+, 12 & under) they have a good deal.  Under $5 for 3 pancakes, eggs & meat.  I recommend eating here vs. the breakfast buffet ($8).  The food tastes better."}
{"text":"Busy Saturday morning option for a birthday breakfast, but the pumpkin pecan pancakes complete with candle for my birthday celebration were worth it!  My first time to this great place and it didn't disappoint!  I got the pancakes (an order of SIX for $5.99...totally could've shared with someone and brought three home) and the hashbrown potatoes which were both delicious and no syrup needed!  Also at our table we have pigs in a blanket (pancake wrapped sausage links), eggs and country ham and a HUGE omelet! Great service, great food and reasonably priced!  If you are in the South Park area...check it out...you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Original Pancake House's pancakes are great!  The best I've ever had?  No, but among the best.  Servers are consistently friendly and efficient, and the dining area is always clean.  Portions are generous, and prices are fair."}
{"text":"They don't let you order from the kids meal if you have weight loss surgery. So if you don't mind ordering a full meal then your ok. As for me I don't even try to. You could share but they don't give you much food to share."}
{"text":"Been here plenty of times for breakfast always had great service and excellent food Came in this morning order completely wrong I order a omelet bacon with spinach light bacon, light cheese I got extra bacon and cheese no spinach. The waitness that I always go to do not want to mention her name had two large table she was waiting on. I understand the larger the quest table the bigger your tip is going to be. Don't screw up are order so that you can get a bigger tip from a larger group. With not be returning back."}
{"text":"Food was not bad but their service wasn't all that great. I'm not impressed with the pancakes... Overall, mediocre experience."}
{"text":"The service and breakfast is always great. Bacon lovers heaven! Something about the bacon here is just mind blowing. :)"}
{"text":"It was all wonderful. The ham & cheddar omelet was fluffy and great. The apple pancake came out so hot and delicious that my sister burned her mouth on it. Mom loves the dutch baby with the lemon and sugar. Definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"I got the chocolate chip pancakes--they were yummy!. However, easily the best part was the whipped cream on top. Not sure if it's homemade, but it sure seemed like it. Also, I wanted to be mad that the side of hash browns with cheese was over $5, but man, that was a lot of hash browns...and they were delicious as well. I'll definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to visit for over a year and I'm not disappointed by far!! Wonderful food! Good service. The omelettes are baked and oh my!!! Fantastic pancakes!!!! Cannot recommend enough! Everyone at our table ate well today"}
{"text":"The only place to ever tell me that I can't have eggs \"sunny side up\". And for a place who's menu says \"Good food takes time\" they sure did seem in a hurry to get us out of there. My bacon waffle and OVER EASY eggs were fantastic."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how anyone couldn't find something on this menu to make embarrassing sounds over!  The omelet was good, the Eggs Benedict, according to my partner in dining, was excellent.    But the crowning touch here is the bacon....yep, the pancakes are good, but that bacon.....ummmmm, ummmmm, ummmmm, good.  The bacon of dreams, if you dream of bacon...and I do, I do!"}
{"text":"Amy was an amazing server! Food was excellent! Will definitely return the next time we are in town"}
{"text":"The food is original but I wish the service was just as awesome as the food. It just seems that every server I've had is always having a crappy day or something. I mean they look like nice people, but their service is half-bleep.  On the other hand, I honestly love the home style, major portions kind of dishes. They're known for their Dutch Baby. I'm not quite sure what it is, but it's a whole bunch of goodness. It's different from waffles and pancakes. I guess that's what makes them original from IHOP. Their omelettes are filling for a great way to start anyones day.  Too bad it's only open til 3pm. Cus I always get those breakfast cravings late at night."}
{"text":"LOVE their Mandarin Crepes, turkey bacon, and fresh squeezed 1/2 OJ+1/2 grapefruit juice blend. A breakfast fail-safe place to go and it's very wallet friendly."}
{"text":"My husband & I are recent residents to Summerlin. We've been trying out all the places that were new to us & looooooved this stop! The service was incredible, the food was AWESOME, and everything was quite affordable! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Popular chain as good as Chicago and San Diego Richard Walker's.  Always busy with lots of beautiful presentation along with beautiful customers adjoining Scottsdale Fashion Square.  More than pancakes and lots of entrees."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me a very long time ago, and it's still one of my favorite places for breakfast. Since then, I've also hooked my friends and family -- its a mandatory send-off breakfast when my cousins from Michigan visit.   The portion sizes are AMAZING -- especially for the price! I usually get the chili omelette (4 baked eggs, smothered in delicious chili) with a side of coconut pancakes (hold the side of tropical syrup) and a small dish of their whipped cream. Basically, I waddle away from the place a very happy kid. The staff are always friendly and attentive, and the wait time is never too wild. The place still only works with cash, so be prepared if you decide to stop in."}
{"text":"Wow. Waiting in line Sunday morning for the OPH, I thought they were handing out free gold dust from the line.  But no, just standard breakfasty grub.  That said, there's an incredibly cheery fireplace, and the menu is a standard but predictably tasty greasy experience.  I didn't have pancakes, because I'm weird--and was intrigued by biscuits and gravy covered with egg/cheese/bacon.  It sounds bizarre, but it was T-A-S-T-E-Y.  (Yes, it was so good I spelled it Fergie style.  Bite me).  The waitress was amazingly sweet, warned me not too much coffee or I'd \"float all the way back to California,\" and told me to check out Seven Saints for California Sliders.  I'll have to follow her advice next time I'm in CU.  Great spot, although you may want to go on a day other than the Lord's.  That wait is craaaaaaaaaazy."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of food options and serve up generous portions.  The food is pretty good and the waitstaff are friendly.  Frankly, their buckwheat pancakes are probably the best I've ever tasted.  Come here but bring a friend: you can't finish one of their entrees unless you're REALLY hungry."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Pancake House for a long time. I love eating breakfast here and sometimes will try new things or just get my norm. I've never had a problem with the food here.   The staff is always friendly and hardly let your coffee cup go empty."}
{"text":"The German pancake is great, it's a very light tasting meal, I recommend giving it a shot. You combine butter powder suger and lemon juice inside the pancake bowl. Or The omelets are yummy but take awhile to cook because of the size. Unlike other places that fold the egg in half. There's is the size of a plate.  The location on flamingo and fort apache is very clean. The booths aren't broken down so here's plenty of cushion."}
{"text":"Great, quick breakfast on a late Saturday morning.  I ordered the wheat germ pancakes and they literally brought me 8 pancakes. Crush were delicious.  I was with a party of 6 and everyone was satisfied."}
{"text":"Oh yes. My mom and I ducked in here after a Dr appointment and I'm SO glad we did. the pancakes were delicious actually everything was delicious. Mom had an omelette that was very well done. My steak and eggs were awesome. I ordered the steak medium rare and it came that way. The over easy eggs came out over easy. The service was great she kept me in coffee and water. A previous reviewer complained about eating with 'elders and degenerates'. When I was there the clientele consisted of business people from downtown and medical people from CMC. So . . . yeah. Give them a try."}
{"text":"I absolutely love breakfast and this place made my love for breakfast even stronger. I came in with a couple friends on a Sunday around noon and, surprisingly, we didn't have to wait that long to get seated even though there were so many people. The menu was extensive and had a wide array of breakfast favorites.   One of my friends spoke highly of the omelettes, so I decided to try one. From the many delectable options, I ended up getting the Chorizo Omelette. The omelettes here are not your ordinary omelettes. These huge and fluffy egg delights are perfectly prepared and super cheesy (which is important). As an egg-slut, excitement ran through me as soon as this King-size pillow of an omelette hit the table. And it doesn't end there. All of the egg plates come with 3 excellent buttermilk pancakes. I love pancakes, so that's winning... Two Times.   Overall, the service was great and the food was excellent. This is definitely a place I want to return to on my next trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Read reviews and was told by coworkers how good this place was. Will never go back in my life. The waitress was 93 years old and rude as they come. She was pulling the menu out of my wifes hand as she was still ordering. My wife asked for green onions with her eggs and was told flat out NO. Then I asked for one of their signature pancakes and was told they were out. No apology or anything. Then was told they could make a small one. I should have went with my instinct and got up and went somewhere who valued their customers.  I ended up staying and waiting for the food.  It finally came and was disgusting.  My wifes eggs were over cooked and had no flavor.  My signature pancake was like eating a sugar coated sponge.  I couldnt even finish it nor did I want to.  This was the first and only place I have eaten at that I didnt leave a tip. I would have given a negative tip if I could have.  Will never go back.  Dont come here unless you like to be treated like crap and fed the same."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of nine and the wait wasn't long at all. The service was great and so was the food! Everyone was so polite and helpful! Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!! Waffle was bomb AF Super good coffee. Food came out fast.  Eat here for sure."}
{"text":"Great food.  Poor service.  Not bad service just not attentive when you have to keep asking for things and they never refill your coffee."}
{"text":"Wow, yelp put me onto a great place to get a fantastic breakfast! The food is great especially the pancakes. Be careful the portion sizes are big and I had to leave a lot of food on my plate. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Absolute best breakfast place in town. We go there on the regular. It's a weekly thing because it's that good. French toast is out of this world. The Dutch baby is super tasty. Their bacon is bomb. And I can't not mention the strawberry pancakes with fresh whipped cream... Delicious. They are always packed, but the wait time is never too long and they bring out your food so fast. This review needed to be written a while ago. I'm finally getting around to it after probably 30 times of going to this place. Trust me. It's good."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, it's just a tad pricey for me. About $50 for three people to eat. They have the best crepes in town. Unfortunately, strawberry goes off the menu for the few months that strawberries are out of season. I always come later in the day because A) I sleep all day and B) I don't like to wait. This place is very popular and gets super busy, so brace yourself unless you come later like I do."}
{"text":"OPH has some of the best pancakes around. Go on a Saturday or Sunday morning chances are you'll have to wait for a seat but it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"I was satisfied. Service was good. Food was decent. Prices were ok. There was no wait on a saturday morning.   The apple sauce was the best dish on the table."}
{"text":"Mostly good results, but screwing up the $3.50 side of breakfast potatoes was a big deal in my mind. It was a small portion of fried potatoes, but over half of the spuds were not cooked. This seems to be a simple problem to overcome if the cook would taste his food. No time to return them due to busy day that day. The rest of the food was good, not great. Short stack of Hawaiian pancakes - loaded with pineapple, topped with coconut and came with it's own sweet syrup. These were good, a new twist. The bacon omelette was fine, nothing superb and the coffee situation was great. My coffee cup was always full. This place falls just outside my Big 4 Scottsdale breakfast eateries."}
{"text":"I agree with many of the other reviews.  The NO CREDIT CARDS ACCEPTED is a bit ridiculous in this day.  It was WAY overpriced.  The menu selections were really limited, I mean it IS a Pancake House, but there was nothing spectacular about it.  I had the spinach and mushroom crepe.  The crepe part was OK, but the filling tasted like previously frozen cooked-spinach mixed with cream of mushroom soup.  They  gave me a little extra bowl of ICE COLD mushroom soup (which they called sauce) on the plate along side of 3 crepes.  Bland, Bland, Bland...... The waitress was OK, but the hostess was pretty \"in your face\" about the CASH only policy and rudely pointed me to the ATM behind me.   I was able to pull together the cash, without using the ATM, so really no big deal. Would I visit again? No.  Sad, because I thought it would be fun for my kids."}
{"text":"Came in on Monday around lunch time and was immediately seated. We ordered the junior pancake meal, adding blueberries for an extra dollar. I don't like eggs without adding ketchup and salt and pepper, but these cheese eggs were good without adding anything. The pancakes were delicious and had no complaints whatsoever. I would recommend it to anyone visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love the Dutch Baby..to go..to go....  No not to go.  Please enjoy here.    If you are breakfast lover, you gotta reserve a morning here. Definitely a nice alternative to a buffet =)"}
{"text":"Yeah, I know it's a chain restaurant. Yeah, it's in one of those min-malls in Vegas (but what isn't?) Yeah, yeah, yeah . . .   It's a really good breakfast.  End of story.  It's a big restaurant.  Our waitress was borderline friendly.  But the food just hits the spot. Try the dutch baby.  It's huge and yummy.  I'd be afraid of the regular size dutch.  yelp it out."}
{"text":"A friend of mine who lives in LV took us over here on a Saturday morning after a crazy night of clubbing. The service was pretty decent and the food was good. I ordered the french toast with a side of coffee.. It was very tasty. Yum yum... Everybody else seemed to like their food as well.   Hmmm... I usually elaborate in my reviews.. but I can't say much about this one.. It's like any typical breakfast diner.. I can't say it's better than IHOP or Denny's.. I think most breakfast diners have very similar food and service.. It just tastes really good when you have a craving for American breakfast items... Ok.. that is all.. Take care now, bye bye..."}
{"text":"There is something to be said about an old \"stand-by\" where you know you'll get a fabulous breakfast, probably have to wait to get seated, and feel like you're back in the \"old days\" while there.  Such is breakfast at The Original Pancake House.  The owner always says \"Hello\" like you're a old friend, and he's frequently seen sitting down and chatting with patrons.  The breaksfasts here are always (think consistently) very good, and I can't think of a visit to this place where the food hasn't been wonderful. One caution: they don't take plastic so bring your cash! And, be prepared to wait to get seated."}
{"text":"Very fast service! I was seated within 10 minutes and served in 15. The only problem was that my order got messed up but other than that the food was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is the business!!!!   I go here all the time with my girlfriend and roommates.  The service is fantastic and prompt.  The decor is awesome. It's 50's style in a hotel... Reminds me of sinatra's Palm Springs! I have actually worn a leisure and fedora here!  The food is to die for... I always get the 49er shoe stack.  They are light thin pancakes from the miner days! Bringing back my Bay roots!!  The food is fast, delicious! This place is a must for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I'm going to need the chef to teach me how to make those omelettes. We ordered the philly cheesesteak omelette, apple waffle and bacon pancakes. EVERYTHING was great. That omelette is really something special. It's huge, but not heavy, almost cloud-like. Not sure how they do that. I NEED to know. We wanted to order the apple pancake special that's popular there, but we were told that it takes about 25 minutes to make, and we didn't have time since we had an appointment. We have already decided that, upon our return, we will make sure we have time to try the pancakes. The bacon pancakes were good too. And the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"One of my Favorite places to get breakfast is this specific o.p.h. I have ate this all over America this specific location the food is always excellent. The only downside in my opinion is that they sell no Coke. They give a choice of Diet Coke or Pepsi. The orange juice is delicious. I recommend the apple baby or 49er flapjacks the bacon, eggs and other sides are also delicious. This is a very convenient location when traveling to the mall."}
{"text":"Not unique, particularly interesting [or ahem . . . original], the Original Pancake House is basically a diner with a wider variety of pancakes to choose from.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to a place with cornucopia of pancake choices, but none of the food was great.  The blueberry pancakes just weren't remarkable and the blueberries weren't fresh or flavorful.  They came with a dusting of powdered sugar, which was a nice touch, but all in all the pancakes were blah.  The Continental Crepe was similarly mediocre -- the actual crepe was good, but was overwhelmed by too much sour cream in the filling.  The side of \"German potatoes\" was also surprisingly flavorless.  In the end, the only remarkable part of the meal was the side order of bacon -- quality pork with perfect crispness.  Bottom line: if you can't think of anywhere else to grab breakfast, the Original Pancake House isn't the worst place to eat."}
{"text":"Good food.  Fast and friendly service.   The hashbrowns were crisp on the outside but not on the inside... by design, but not bad. Only issue was that the staff didn't inform me of up charges on menu items.  For instance going from potato pancakes to hashbrowns was 2.20. .  Then When The Bill Came I Was Double Charged for one entree.  They fixed it and apologized but I'm lucky I noticed it."}
{"text":"We ordered a 4 egg fresh veggie omlet with blueberry pancakes.  The wait was pretty long... but I gather that that is the norm here."}
{"text":"There is no gluten-free menu, which automatically places it well below The Cracked Egg, in my opinion. The sausage was good, eggs were nothing special, ham was a bit too thick and flavorless, and bacon too salty. Obviously pancakes are their specialty, and they looked delish, but unfortunately they don't have many options for those with food allergies. I went on a Sunday, and service was subpar (it took 15 minutes to be seated, 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us at a table, and we didn't get paid much attention when it came to drinks or orders). I didn't get sick from the food, but I can't see a reason to return."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Original Pancake House since I moved to Vegas in 2003. Unfortunately for me, there are only two locations left: one on Fort Apache near Flamingo and the 215, and the other at Primm. Such a shame, because their pancakes, I believe, are better than IHOP's, and their thick-cut bacon is juicy and yummy.  We went early a.m. on a Friday for this particular visit. My friend had the strawberry crepes (very large) and I had a half-order of the strawberry pancakes. We both had a side of bacon. Yum! Service was good. Everything on the menu is good. The omlettes are huuuge! Try the pancakes...they are the best!"}
{"text":"We love coming here for breakfast. When you have to wait to be seated it tells you this place is good :)  stuff is very friendly,  restaurant is clean. We like the menu. Not just traditional American breakfast but nice options to choose from.  My favorites are Shells,  Nutella crepes,  Mandarin crepes. But looking on the food being delivered -  everything looks good. Will go back soon!"}
{"text":"They make everything in house. Comes beef and hash was not much hash, a bit greasy but good. The pancakes were really good! Fluffy, hot perfect with the whipped butter and the hot syrup I was in heaven with those and they were just the right size for me too! Looking forward to next time to just getting more pancakes!"}
{"text":"You know the arrogant asshole that no one wants to like--because he's an arrogant asshole--but everyone begrudgingly does like--because he's just so damn good?  (resist the temptation to say I'm that arrogant asshole)  Well, the Original Pancake House is just that arrogant asshole.  What you'll notice when you first arrive is (usually) a long wait and a bunch of rules.  Cash only.  We'll only seat full parties (or even put their names in line).  Substitutions at a la carte prices.  Sharing requires an additional fee.  Only short stacks of 49er flapjacks on the weekends.  Etc.  Etc.  So the first time you go there, you'll probably think, \"this place may be good, but it won't be *that* good.\"  Well you'd be wrong.  I was.  The food here is bar none the best basic breakfast food you'll ever eat.  It's just perfect.  The strawberry pancakes come with this amazing strawberry syrup that is good enough to eat by itself with dabs of the homemade whipped cream (I know from experience).  The patty sausage is a pure euphony of spices.  My heart skips two beats every time I eat there.  Recommendations: the French crepes.  If you like strawberries and/or anything delicious, have the crepes.  The only, and I mean only problem with them is that they don't come with anything salty so if you want a variety then have a bite of someone else's shit because you absolutely must have these things.  49er flapjacks--thin, chewy, mindbendingly good.  Pecan pancakes.  They also offer many different types of crepes, oven baked omelettes, chocolate chip pancakes, coconut pancakes, blueberry, bacon pancakes, and on and on.  And, if it looks good to you, their specialty is this gigantic apple pancake--but imho it isn't the best thing on the menu.  Same with the Dutch baby.  Look: I know food.  Really.  If you don't like this place, then you are just a hater.  Sometimes you have to look past the rude hostess, the long wait times, and the excessive rules and just enjoy the best breakfast that the city has to offer.  And at least now they have a goddamn ATM in the store."}
{"text":"It's been nearly 2 years since I've been back here. The first thing I noticed was that they now take credit card! The second thing? The food is still amazing. Going strong for over 50 years, Original Pancake House is a Scottsdale treat that you just can't beat! Try their daily specials; I had the Leo omlette and the salmon was rich and smoky. For a price that beats out your daily diner, stop in; but do it before 2 or you'll miss out!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite breakfast/brunch place in charlotte. Being an eggitarian i like to come to this place on the weekends for brunch. Their hash browns and eggs with pancake easily fills my stomach. It's crowded in the mornings so you might have to wait in the line to be seated.  The French press coffee served is the best! You have lot of options to choose from their menu and customize your breakfast/lunch however you like.   The staff is friendly. Try this place and I am sure you will love it."}
{"text":"Before heading home from Vegas, OPH is the last eating establishment we visit.  It's tradition now.  Why?  Breakfast done right, priced for the quality and quantity received, and world class service.  The last visit, the Mrs. wanted to add some salsa to her eggs.  She asked the waitress how hot (spicy) it was, and was given a sample taste.  Not hot enough for her liking.  The manager overheard her tell the waitress that it wasn't hot enough, so he stops by the table and tells her that it is his recipe, and asks if she wants to try a hotter version.  Now, what other breakfast place can you name where the manager takes that much pride in his salsa and makes a batch for a solo customer?  More known for egg sauces and pancake syrup (and obviously, bacon) than homemade salsa, that was a nice touch!  The omelets are cheesy good, the pancakes always hot and fresh, the OJ tastes like oranges and not orange-flavored juice, the coffee good and strong, and great service.  Sold!"}
{"text":"For under $8 (in South Park, that's nothing), I was served two eggs, two potato pancakes, three pancakes and three turkey sausage links.  I went for lunch on election day 2010 and though the place was packed, our party of two was seated immediately.  The eggs were decent; nothing special.  The potato pancakes were pretty good, but not the best I've had.  The turkey sausage and pancakes, on the other hand, were the best I've had in Charlotte.  In my experience, turkey sausage is just something that restaurants keep on hand to please their selective customers (again, this is South Park we're talking about), but I actually feel like the Original Pancake House cared about the quality of even their more obscure ingredients.  As for the pancakes, they were simply the best I've had, which says a lot considering I'm not a huge fan of pancakes in general.  This filling lunch was well worth my $8.  The best breakfast restaurant I've been to around the Quail Commons area where I work."}
{"text":"Service was slow and dismissive. Food was excellent-the best waffles and pancakes.  Place needs a deep cleaning and training in customer service."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan unless they have their vegetable soup. My boyfriend on the other hand loves this place and has to go every time he's in town. I have to settle. LOL. He loves basically all of the omelets, and pancakes. I settle for their sandwiches because I don't like breakfast like that."}
{"text":"I loved this place. A variety of choices to choose from. Kids meals are a big shareable portions. This place was packed but the wait time was less than 10 min. A frequent placed to add to your list. We ordered too much food omelette, pancakes, crepes... great way to start your family day without having to take out a pan and cook. Atmosphere was pleasant and family friendly."}
{"text":"It's your sub-standard breakfast joint. Moderately busy on any given weekday, ungodly busy on Saturdays. It seems like everyone wakes up at the exact same moment and realizes they don't want know how to make pancakes in their own kitchen.   The menu is what you've had in every other joint -- pancakes, sausage, bacon, toast, fruit, etc. One thing I do end up enjoying more than any other carb-laden item is the oatmeal. It's actually pretty good and rather hearty.   If you're headed in for a quick breakfast/readthrough of the paper on a weekday, you're safe. If you're coming in for a Saturday breakfast at 10am, good luck."}
{"text":"WAY overpriced. Wait is crazy on weekends. I don't understand why people think the pancakes are so good...I can make much tastier buttermilk pancakes at home for much cheaper."}
{"text":"There is not a better \"pancake house\" anywhere. No matter what town you are in, if there is an Original Pancake House, you are in for great food. This shop on Ft. Apache Rd is one of the best. Great service and cooks that know how to make you smile."}
{"text":"Our go to breakfast place. This place never disappoints. I hate that I have to wait so long to get a table. We have learned to not visit this place on Sunday. It's over crowed. Week days are pretty decent and Saturday if u can go before 9am.   I love their pancakes. They do an awesome job with it. When strawberries are in season, I always get the strawberry with whip cream on the pancakes. I also love their buck wheat pancake. It was a hearty taste to it.   Their prices are reasonable and the service is fast and very friendly. If u are craving for good fluffy pancakes with great service, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Let me first say, Breakfast out is one of my favorite things in the world.   If they delivered this to my hotel room, I would be in absolute heaven and I would do whatever necessary to never check out of that hotel.   Secondly, the food here is the best in Las Vegas, there is only one place in LA that may beat this, and that is only because its on Sunset and I'm usually a bit hungover when I eat there, OK I'm daydreaming.   OK, down to the good stuff..order the eggs Benedict, AND the dutch baby. Don't argue with me, just do it.   I cannot order only one thing here and if you do, your missing out on SOMETHING. The bacon is so good, it may be the reason I can't be a vegetarian, and why I don't weigh 115 pounds."}
{"text":"I really like OPH's pancakes.  Especially the fresh strawberry pancakes, when in season.    Like others have said, the wait is ridiculous.  The service is usually very good.    Prices are decent for most items.  There is no waffle on the kids menu, so be prepared to shell out over 5 bucks for one.  Really, the thing probably cost .80 TOPS, to make."}
{"text":"During my stay in Champaign, I made it here twice it was that good! I got 2 words for you Shiela: Zip Disc. Well okay, maybe these 2 words are more apropos: Dutch Baby. And for those who don't know what this is: it's DELICIOUS! That's pretty much all you need to know, and to wait a little extra time for this piping, fresh, flaky, pancake version of amazingness to come to your table. Be sure to order the side of bacon, and fresh juice to round out your breakfast/brunch situation. It does get busy on weekends, so be prepared to have a little wait and help yourself to the complimentary coffee.  I'll pretty much do anything for a dutch baby, especially when the strawberries and banana are so fresh and yum. Go get one, now!"}
{"text":"1. Sunday morning: The wait time was about 25-30 min.  Host was very friendly and making sure you are comfortable and kept us informed on the wait time.  I just had to order two.  Yum...  2. Ordered the French press style coffee( dark roast) with cream: my god.  Heavenly.   Best coffee I have ever had in a very long time.   3. Blintz: did not have it. It is seasonal: spring and fall.  Waitress recommended highly.  I cannot wait.   4. Strawberry crepes: very good. Came with real strawberries on top.    5. Eggs and bacon sandwich on a sour bread: not bad.  Bacon was burnt a little bit.    I will defiantly come back here again."}
{"text":"Charlotte has so few breakfast places this will have to do. Although I prefer a local place. The coffee was great, I got the pecan pumpkin pancakes with a side of bacon. Delicious but the whipped cream was kind of weird. Server was friendly and we got our food and seat very fast."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I've been here and it's so great to see that the service and quality that I remember have been upheld. We always get the most friendly servers (this time it was Jesse and he was wonderful) and the food is fantastic. I don't know how they get their pancakes so fluffy but they are the best in town! The food came out fast and we had a really enjoyable time! Yummy stuff, right here!"}
{"text":"My rating is not based on the food. Last time I ate there it was just as good as the one I worked at in La Grange, IL. It is definitely the service that has always been the problem. I don't know why. I've had a plate of bacon literally thrown down on the table at me with a nasty look. I've waited forever even after being seated. Things have been forgotten. But the food has always been good. It is pricey, but if they make it true to what they are supposed to do, there is a reason for it. I was an assistant manager at the one in IL. We made literally everything from scratch. We even melted a 25 lb chunk of butter to make our clarified butter to cook the pancakes on the griddle with. We ground our own corned beef and peeled the potatoes for the hash. The sour dough batter was made from a fermenting potato. The syrups were all homemade. I seriously mean every single thing was homemade. So all this does take time and quality ingredients to make which costs. With that being said, I learned how to make my own apple pancakes at home and we now have them every Sunday with thick sliced bacon and fresh squeezed orange juice for a fraction of what it would cost us to go to OPH."}
{"text":"Can we talk Original Pancake House for a second? (Of course we can, that's why you are reading this)  OPH is rapidly becoming a Sunday ritual for the roommate and I. Despite all the delicious and fancy brunch options around this fair city, there is something about those fluffy circles of love and their breakfast-y entourage that is undeniable. My standby is the banana pancakes, which come with a tropical syrup that tastes like (and might be) liquid marmalade. One week when I was feeling particularly childlike I went with the chocolate chip pancakes sans whipped cream. They hit the spot without making me feel like I was going to go into diabetic coma. If a traditional breakfast combo is what you seek grab the 2 eggs and either bacon or sausage meal (links are better than patties in this situation). It comes with a side of three pancakes and will be sure to fill you up right to the brim.  The staff matches up to the quality of the food beautifully. I have never encountered an OPH employee who was anything but cheery and helpful (This includes the waiter who said he could *make* some ginger ale for my friend. She said it tasted like Canada Dry but the fact that he came by to ask how it was left us wondering).  The next time you are wondering where to grab your mimosas or bloody marys on a Sunday afternoon, try passing on the trendy brunch and grab some good old pancakes. They'll do you a world of good."}
{"text":"Wasn't quite 5 stars but pretty darn close. (I think it might be cause I'm not really a breakfast person)  First time I've been to The Original Pancake House and I'd definitely go back.   The wait was pretty short (10 minutes). It was pretty packed and we went on a Friday around 10:30AM.   The waitress was amazing. I usually hate being that person that substitutes everything, but I wanted to try a lot of things on the menu. She suggested I substitute things and order half-orders (which isn't explicitly advertised).   I ended up getting a half order of the Eggs Michael (similar to Eggs Benedict) and I substituted the potato pancakes for BACON pancakes.  I always crave biscuits and gravy and she let me order a \"quarter order\" (one biscuit)  Pretty good meal,but I definitely couldn't finish what I ordered.  I honestly didn't think I liked it as much, simply because I was too busy staring at what my boyfriend ordered. He got the The Original Scrambler. HOLY COW! Biscuits and gravy, potatoes, scrambled eggs...oh my. I'll definitely order that when I go next time.  Don't forget to get the freshly squeezed orange juice!"}
{"text":"We came here on a $20 Groupon today at about 1pm.  It was super empty, which is unusual for any OPH we've ever been to, even this late in the day.    We ordered a Dutch panacake, and spinach omelet with cheddar and gouda and substituted the pancakes that came with it with wheat toast.  With that we ordered a side of bacon and coffee.  The coffee was not the smooth coffee we've normally had at OPH in San Diego.  I had to add a lot of cream and sugar and it was still bitter.    We ordered the Dutch Pancake while we looked over the menu.  It normally takes a while to cook.  When it arrived it was deflated and looked like yesterday's leftover pancake.  We asked the server if that is normally how they come out and she said normally they have higher walls and look much better and she had no idea what happened to this one.  Why she would serve it then, we have no idea.  So she said she would have them make another one.  Well if it's going to take another 15 minutes and the rest of the food was already here, we didn't want her to take the deflated one while we waited for the replacement one.  So she said she would have them cook the smaller Dutch Baby instead of the regular one.  So that was disappointing.  My spinach and cheese crepe was super good, and very flavorful - maybe a little on the salty side.  It had tons of cheddar cheese inside and the gouda must have been what was toasted on top. It was full of spinach too.  I was quite happy with it. Although, it would have been nice if the server had mentioned that they couldn't do a blend of cheddar/gouda, and that she was going to charge for extra cheese.  But overall I was happy with the omelet.  The bacon was awesome as always.  I asked them to under-cook and it was just the way I wanted it.  Our total bill came to $33.67, which is a bit pricey.  I'm glad we had our $20 Groupon, although it wasn't really all that much of a savings since I paid $10 for it.  We'll still come back.  We love Original Pancake House in general and were excited to find one in Vegas.  We saw them bring an Apple pancake to the table next to us and it looked really good.  So I think we'll try that on our next visit."}
{"text":"The perfect budget breakfast place in the area. I call it budget because it's not the type where you are coming for gourmet brunch. However it's not something I would compare to a Waffle House because that would be a complete disservice to the business.   The wait can be lengthy but if you expect that coming in, it's not too bad. They have a pretty expansive menu with all kinds of breakfast offerings. The service is quick and friendly and the food comes out quickly as well.   Overall, it is great for the price. The pancakes are amazing and the coffee cups are too cool (they even offer them for sale at the front). I love stopping in here when I'm not trying to pay an arm and a leg for breakfast but also don't want to have to worry about where the pancake better may have been kept."}
{"text":"the Dutch baby was dense and lacking flavor, despite the powdered sugar, lemon juice, butter and syrup.  I was picturing more of a Danish consistency and sweetness in the center, and that was just not the case.  wouldn't recommend it and my husband didn't like it either.  he got the pigs in a blanket, which he liked.  the syrup container had syrup running down the bottle and handle when it was placed on the table.  the bathroom was not the best either.  first time in one of these and I was pretty disappointed, although if I had gotten a more traditional pancake or waffle breakfast I probably would have been happier.  having an upset stomach after breakfast just doesn't leave a good taste in my mouth for the place. oh well."}
{"text":"I think you could pretty easily compare this restaurant to an IHOP/Village Inn type establishment. It was similarly priced but the food was definitely better than your typical (cheaper) breakfast joint. We were seated right away but there seemed to be a pretty consistent wait in the small dining room. Our table was in a pretty cramped area which I normally don't mind but few people would ever want to sit that close to my typical frazzled Sunday morning self.   Our food was average. I had a pecan waffle and OJ, the hubby had a short stack of yeast pancakes, home-style potatoes and OJ. It was all OK, our service was good and the check with tip totaled $26 (cash ONLY.) A good alternative to typical breakfast chains but overall nothing that made me swoon over my plate."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Huge variety of pancakes and more on the menu.  All very tempting, but from the first time we visited we tried the Eggs Benedict and have been hooked ever since!!  The Hollandaise sauce is the best I've had ever - anywhere!  And the potato pancakes that come with them are to die for!!  I don't know how they do it, they are thin, crisp, potatoey and very onioney.  I love them!!  It only makes me sad that I live in Durham and only get to this place about once a year.  I did switch once and try the Dutch Baby, which was big and lovely and tasty with all the powdered sugar, butter and lemony, but I really missed my eggs bennie and potato pancakes and have never looked back.  Oh, you must try it and btw, get the sour cream and applesauce for the tater pancakes."}
{"text":"While it's called the Original Pancake House, and their specialty pancakes are very good and classic not just pancakes with a bunch of sweet stuff piled on, the omelette a are amazing. They are baked! A completely different experience and very very tasty."}
{"text":"The pancakes were wonderful - we will be returning on our next LV visit!!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. The food was decent (I don't know how to mess up breakfast food), but not spectacular.   I had an egg/pancake/bacon combo and it was pretty cheap.   The bacon was done to perfection. A little crispy, a little chewy. The pancakes weren't very large or particularly delicious. The eggs were done just about right.  There was also a pretty long wait. I don't like waiting, especially if the food isn't the best. I doubt I will ever plan on going here again, but if somebody were to invite me, I wouldn't say no."}
{"text":"So this place is amazing. I mean, if you really want a great place to get breakfast, come here. Although they're incredibly busy on weekend mornings (so get here early!) the food is well worth the wait. My first time here I got the pancakes after a few friends had recommended them, and wow, they were remarkable. In all honesty, I think they may have been the best pancakes I have ever had. They were cooked to perfection, light and fluffy. I've had the french toast as well, and it did not disappoint.  All in all, this is one of the best breakfast spots in C-U. If you are an early riser, or don't mind semi-long waits, this place is definitely for you. A must stop that will become a favorite of anyone who walks through the door."}
{"text":"Great quantities for the price. Easily tops major chains like IHOP, and its local! Give em a go"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 eggs (over easy) and sausage patties, toast and a biscuit. To start off the price came out to 17 dollars. Wayyyy to expensive unless the quality is worth it. Let me tell you it wasn't even close. The sausage patties were super dry. The eggs were over cooked. The toast was fine. The biscuit was so dry and crumbled when I tried splitting it. I needed to drink water to wash it down. The service was adequate. Took forever to get our food. I asked for a water and took a while to get that too. Overall I would not go back."}
{"text":"I am a nice person but I don't have nothing nice to say about this place .The food was not hot the bacon taste like it was a year old the waiter smell like he had been drinking all night long .And to top everything off the cashier was rude I will not be back ever"}
{"text":"This place is the best in town for breakfast. The parking lot is always full so get there early if you don't want to wait. My wife and I stopped in around 7am for breakfast on a Thursday and we got right in. I ordered a half-omelet which is baked in the oven and tastes much better than a regular omelet. The half omelet is a decent size so don't order a full sized omelet unless you plan on taking a good chunk of it home for later.   The bacon is the best I've ever had as its a lot thicker than most places. If you like orange juice, they freshly squeeze it here and it's good. The staff is friendly and they keep the drinks refilled."}
{"text":"For some reason, the first time I came here I thought this place was called \"Ed's Original Pancake House\", and my brother and I always referred to this place as \"Ed's\" thereafter.  Anyway, Ed's is particularly fantastic, great pancakes and other assorted breakfast fare.  My favorite would be the Strawberry Pancakes, which come with fresh strawberries and strawberry syrup.  Fantastic stuff.  Additionally, Ed's had one of the best waiter-customer exchanges ever, as my brother noticed that actor Leslie Nielsen had signed his name on the wall...  My brother: \"I'll have what Leslie Nielsen orders\" Sassy Waitress: \"Oh, that guy looks like HELL!!\" My brother: \"Well I'm going to order whatever he gets.\" Sassy Waitress: \"He ordered two egg whites and dry wheat toast.  Should I mark you down for that?\" My brother: \"Ah, never mind.\"  Anyway, check this place out.  Great no-nonsense breakfast, and I love that the no cell phone policy is strictly enforced."}
{"text":"Breakfast all day.  Who doesn't love breakfast for dinner? Every where i live, i have to find a place that serves diner style breakfast all day because every now and then i need pancakes for dinner. :)  This is a little diner type place that has good pancakes and all your regular breakfast items. On weekend mornings there is always a wait and lots of larger groups - but it usually moves pretty fast.  They have this thing called a Dutch Baby - I never tried it, but it looked like a giant bowl shaped pancake.. people seemed to like it.  Omlets are HUGE, pancakes are fluffy, coffee is diner style..  i like it."}
{"text":"This is an alternative to dennys, or IHOP or Mimis, Carrows, etc. The thing I liked about it was breakfast all day because I am someone who has to have breakfast for dinner and breakfast for lunch when I get stressed. Seems like nothing helps stress so much as a stack of strawberry pancakes and a cup of joe.  Good for kids and family meals, moderately priced, clean and comfortable with a good menu of standard breakfast treats. I do have to say, I have not eaten anything but breakfast here, so I couldnt rate the other meal options.  Portions are big, especially the omelets.. HUGE!"}
{"text":"Cash only!!! Have been here several times. Only did not wait for a place to sit twice after about 15 visits. Have tried almost all things on menu, but the 2 faves are: Cherry Kijafa Crepes & Mandarin Crepes. Along with  the omelets, all pancakes...All yummy! Only bad thing from last visit, pancakes were almost cold before got syrup & butter...:("}
{"text":"Honestly, I hate this place.  It's not the food.  The chocolate chip, or bacon pancakes, FOR-GET-ABOUT-IT.  They are amazing.  My biggest issue is everyone's biggest issue.  Jammed into a severely dated waiting area with forty other sad sacks, everyone scurrying over one another like ants at a picnic!  It's something, boy.  And not a _good_ something.  Parking is a nightmare.  There's plenty of it, to be sure, but I can't tell you how many times on a Sunday, I've gone to back out, or pull around, and someone's almost side-swiped me.  There are a lot of people still driving in that parking lot who maybe shouldn't be?  It's a bit dangerous.  I'm being serious, now.  No hyperbole!  The other down side is that for the privilege of not being able to hear yourself (think), or the folks you're with (talk), you also get to pay them about twenty times more than what a darn pancake should cost. =P    I'm just not a huge fan of this joint.  Sadly, my in-laws love(d) it.  That meant meeting up between 6 and 7:30AM to grab Sunday breakfast.  One would think there'd be a chance of missing the throng that early, but one would be very mistaken. =P  No matter what time it is, this place is always buzzing!  Have those pancakes tho.  My stomach is growling just thinking of them!"}
{"text":"The Skinny: there's only one thing good here and that's the giant apple pancake... 'nuff said (4), Service - pretty good but it was also on a weekday morning so *shrug* (3) Value - okay, not great.  There is only one reason to come here and that's the giant apple pancake. I'm going to take a few minutes to wax poetic about the giant apple pancake.   It's not so much a pancake but a poor man's form of tarte tatin aux pommes (or a french word upside down apple tart - essentially).  I swear, when anyone orders this, the aroma of apple and cinnamon surrounds at least a radius of two tables.   The bottom layer is crisp from being finished in the oven. The middle layers of the pancake takes on a rich, eggy, bread-custard-like quality. This is all topped with apples carmelized with brown sugar and plenty of cinnamon.   This is not that crappy overly sweet pre-made apple topping you see at a buffet. No - you can still see the bits of peel from the apple - this is the real thing. The pancake fills the plate and is often too hard to finish alone.  Oh yeah, baby. This  is da bomb - and all under $10.  My hubby ordered an omelette which was bleh but the regular pancakes were pretty good. He also ordered a very small glass of juice (cranberry) which didn't seem like a very good deal (at  the supermarket you can buy an entire jug for that price!).  So do check this place out - for the giant apple pancake - but basically everything else is just okay."}
{"text":"Im from Arizona visiting and This place is awesome, great service, awesome food. A great menu. If you want to eat healthy you can eat healthy you want to pig out then go for it."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, super chill yet super fast! Drinks Always stay full and food tastes great! Best part is when they give you your food they also leave the check so you can get out of there as soon as you want!"}
{"text":"Long time yelp reader, first time reviewer...  I wanted my first review to be about a place I've never had problems with and OPH was the first thing that came to mind.  Located in Las Vegas near the Arizona Charlie's on the corner of Charleston and Decatur, I always make it a point to visit OPH for breakfast when I'm in town--usually the Sunday morning before we head back to Cali.  The serving is generous, even their half-orders are more than enough for my friends who don't want too much.  It's also one of the few places I know that serves potato pancakes...or maybe I haven't been out much.  Regardless, their potato pancakes are top notch.  It goes great with a side order of corned beef.  The omelettes are amazing.  I'd love to know how to make omelettes the same way OPH does at home if I could.  Mind you, I'm not even mentioning the other pancakes--you jus can't go wrong with any of em.  You just have to try them for yourself.  Almost everyone I know has their own preference: the one with their favorite fruit, the one with the chocolate chips, and the famous Dutch Baby.  Bottom line:  when you're in Vegas, it's definitely worth a few minutes trip from the Strip to enjoy this place.  ^_^"}
{"text":"Very mediocre breakfast food. I've definitely experienced better. The food is very eh."}
{"text":"This past Thanksgiving time was my second time here in the past 10 years and to me it was better the second time than the first.  It really does blow all those other huge chains away that seem to enter a city and devour the competition.  No, OPH really is a cut above the rest. The pancakes are naturally on-point with a great variety. Hence the time of year I had to try the pumpkin pancakes - which I've been a fan of before they became famous the nationwide.  I even some simple scrambled eggs to add and they were quite tasty.   The staff was also very nice, even better than before.  Next time in Charlotte this will once again be my first stop-over."}
{"text":"I had the chorizo omelet with pecan pancakes on my first visit. Absolutely incredible. The omelet was huge and had a ton of flavor. That salsa they bring is the ticket. I took my pancakes home and had them later-soooooo good! They bring the syrup hot so I kind of wish I would've had them there but that omelet won that battle.   My second visit I had to have the chorizo omelet again but I subbed hash browns for pancakes. Bad choice, but lesson learned.   Definitely worth the wait and hunt/fight for a parking spot."}
{"text":"The food is great, and the establishment is clean, nice, with plenty of sunlight if you're going on a nice Sat/Sun morning. My problem is the service. Most of the waitresses are unbelievably rude. They want you to leave ASAP so they can seat someone else and make more tips I assume. Specially Teresa, who doesn't even say hi and enjoys dropping hints about leaving, like coming by and asking if we want coffees to go, even after being there just a short time. It's ridiculous and ruins the experience."}
{"text":"The service was very prompt and the food was good. I had an omelette the size of my face! It was awesome. I like the diner feel it gives without being to chain like. Amy was our server and she was absolutely perfect! The comfort of the food and busy atmosphere makes this place feel like home for me.  Good job!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite one and I visit here at least weekly once. Today have ordered for feta spinach omelet as I do every time I visit. According to the menu, it doesn't contains any meat. But they served me 'something' with lot of cheese n ham. I have realized that after taking couple of bites. I don't eat meat..I was super hungry n came out from my favorite restaurant with an empty stomach. They hardly cared and am surprised. I am pissed off. It never happened before."}
{"text":"I saw a Groupon cash back offer of Original Pancake House. I gave the place a shot along with my husband. The wait was long but I did appreciate on how close the host was at estimating the wait time. Wait time was 11 minutes. The waiter was very kind. The atmosphere was extremely family friendly. My husband ordered Chocolate pancakes with eggs and bacon on the side . I ordered another meal I forgot the name but it was chopped ham with grilled onions and egg on the top and potato pancakes. The pancakes where far better than any other ihop I have eaten from."}
{"text":"I don't write many reviews and only write this one in the hopes of saving someone else a drive; I know I sure wish I'd seen this info before trekking over here. If you're coming here for some gluten free pancakes based on the reviews on gluten free websites, the companies website, etc. like I did, be prepared for disappointment. While this chain of restaurants does offer a wide variety of gluten free pancake options, this particular location has a different menu than other locations, which includes no gluten free choices. I'm not just talking about cross contamination, either. I was told all pancakes have wheat flour in them. Even their buckwheat pancakes have wheat flour. The staff was polite enough but I can't comment on any other food, the only reason I came was for pancakes. Based off of the small time I spent here, it seems VERY similar to a Waffle House though."}
{"text":"Our family's favorite breakfast place of all time never disappoints.  First time at the Charlotte location and it was as consistent as ever.  We enjoyed the pumpkin and chocolate chip pancakes.  Solid coffee. Hasn't lost its place at the top.  Be sure to visit whenever you need a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"The Dutch baby is insanely good with butter.  Spinach omelette is big and delicious.  Coffee is just ok."}
{"text":"According to Yelp, I have checked in here 38 times since 2012... but I can guarantee that it has been FAR more times than that!  We still love coming here for breakfast.  We have a few favorite servers that have been there for years!  My favorites are definitely the bacon and eggs with the pancakes and Venecia Benedict.  Oh and the coffee is a MUST.  It's really good!  All in all, we will keep this as our go to breakfast spot, even though we live 30 minutes away from it now!  Wait times can rack up if you go during the busy times on the weekends, but not too bad when it comes down to it."}
{"text":"We have been out in Danville, il for two weeks and if you've  been here you'd know that the town is really small. The closest bigger city is Champaign, il.  Anyways, two weeks of hotel breakfast had me wanting to shoot myself. On a fine Saturday morning we decided to drive 40 miles to champaign to eat brunch. Searched on yelp for omelettes and found this place. It had good reviews so why not.  I had the Santa-fe omelette with banana pancakes.  This place blows IHOP, Denny's or any other diner out of the park. They were extremely busy but service was still great and the food was phenomenal.  We may drive back again tomorrow.  That's right I am loco for breakfast."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in town and have time for breakfast, I stop by here. I love the Sweedish or 49er flapjack with lingonberry sauce.  They are also fo mouse for their Dutch Baby, it's really good, I just like mine better."}
{"text":"I had the fresh squeezed oj, which actually tasted fresh squeezed to start. Then had the chorizo omelette. The omelette was HUGE! And so yummy! I got the hashbrowns as a side. They were more like homefries than hashbrowns but they still tasted good. The place was soooo crowded when we went (noon on a Sunday) but we probably only waited 10 minutes for a table. Definitely going back there again soon!"}
{"text":"Out of all the breakfast diners in Madison, this is my favorite. The food totally does it for me. The venue itself is a little divey and the service was okay, but I'd go there again and again for one of those massive fluffy omelettes and some pancakes. Yes, plz.   While I have only been to this OPH once, the location in Minneapolis that I usually go to has great crepes, apple pancakes, etc. I haven't had anything I didn't care for, and I can tell the Madison location is no different.   Just beware, there's usually a wait unless there's a football game going on, so go early and maybe call before you plan to leave. I'm drooling... Looking forward to next time."}
{"text":"Great service and great food for reasonable prices.  Had the apple pancakes and they were awesome, but be sure to let it cool a little before eating.  My group had the Farmers Skillet, Bacon Pancakes, Strawberry Crepes, Strawberry Waffle, Three Little Pigs in Blankets, Sausage Eggs and Biscuits, and bacon bacon and bacon.  I would recommend all of these as good choices. I wish they were open late like the one back in my hometown, because breakfast is sometimes good for dinner."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food here is fantastic, which is why I recommended it to my co-workers. The problem I had this morning was attempting to place a pick up order for myself and co-workers. I called and was told that they are not filling pick up orders, I have never heard this from any kind of breakfast restaurant in my life. After considering the time it took for everybody to figure out there orders and the amount of money we were about to spend I thought maybe they would reconsider. I called back and was transferred to the manager who was even more unreasonable. I was told they just don't have any body to fill the order (put food in styrofoam boxes and the boxes into a plastic bag?). That sounds an utterly ridiculous reason to not make an easy $100+. I will never suggest this restaurant to anybody ever again. I myself will also not spend a dime in this place, which is hard to say because I really enjoy the   food."}
{"text":"The pancake house was just an average experience for my friends and I. We had only a minor wait and was called in and seated by a not so friendly hostess.  Our waitress was definitely the best thing about breakfast, she was fast, really friendly, and kept the water and coffee flowing - I think she called each and every one of us 'love' at some point too!    In terms of the food, expect a pretty typical diner-esk experience.  My omelet was huge and I enjoyed it, the pancakes were also really tasty and coupled with the hot syrup made it even better.  My friend got a pecan waffle, it was honestly the smallest, thinnest waffle I have seen served at a diner.  My other friend ordered cheese grits and was really disappointed with them.  Overall it seemed like about half of the food we ordered was good, the other half was rather disappointing.    If you are looking for this place along Charlottetown ave, don't look for a sign out front, it's just a plain looking brick building, with a really jam packed parking lot - so expect to have a tough time getting a spot if its prime time breakfast time!"}
{"text":"Great buttermilk pancakes and an interesting, well flavored corned beef hash and potatoes. Always had good service as well.  I've heard people rave about the omelets, but I'm not a huge fan."}
{"text":"Love this place for its Apple Pancake! Always a hit. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Neither slow seating or waiting over 5 mins for coffee will dissuade me from going back to get another apple pancake. Everyone has an off day and this was one for the OPH. An old school diner that offers a few healthy items and two pages of wonderful breakfast gluttony. I love the irony of this joint just a short walk from glitzy fashion place mall. A long line forms on the weekend so get there early or take a news paper to kill the 30+ minute wait. No plastic here...OPH is cash only so remember to bring a few Jacksons with you."}
{"text":"I started going to this place in the late 90s!  The scrambled eggs and ham is supered. They had a special seasoning and the generous ham chunks taste like honey baked ham. Their Dutch babies are by far the best in town. Love the Swedish pancakes as well.  Food is always good but service  is sometimes amazing and other times down right bad but the food outweighs the service."}
{"text":"Food so good you just want to fuck it rather than actually eat it!"}
{"text":"I love this pancake house because they have great service and the best gluten free pancakes I've ever had in my life. I try to go here as often as possible lol, even though it's across town. On weekends there is no place to park in the shopping center and the restaurant is packed so I try to visit during the week. Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"In todays Champaign paper, it says that they got a health rating of 25 out of 100."}
{"text":"Food was good at a reasonable price.  Waitress seemed impatient with taking our order when one in our group couldn't make up her mind. We stayed for a long time, we were asked if we wanted refills on coffee and water every 5 minutes after we received our food."}
{"text":"As a Madison native, I've been going to the Madison branch for about 15 years. Most valuable brunch award.  Ambiance: It is a chain but for the Original Pancake House, each branch is very different. This is the least fancy one I've been to, and it feels the most homey and local. I think it is also cheaper.   You'll most likely wait at least 20 minutes on the weekends no matter how small your group is.   I've eaten before closing once and the waiter gave us free hash browns that they had made and didn't serve.   Lunch: Everything is SO GOOD! I tend to get omelettes for brunch or french toast if I'm feeling like splurging. But I never get omelettes or french toast here because everything else is too good.   -Crepes are amazing. Blueberry crepes are my go-to. It comes with blueberry syrup with real blueberries in it. They always match a syrup with your flavor of crepe or pancakes.   -The waffles are crunchy and soft on the inside.   -The pancakes are huge and fluffy but not too fluffy. I love that they have healthier options like buckwheat pancakes.   -The whipped cream comes with almost any dish if you ask for it. It's house made and so good.   -Too few people get the Dutch Baby, possibly because there is a warning sign on the menu of taking longer than other orders, but it always comes out at a reasonable time. It's chewy like a swedish pancake, but thicker, and toasty on the edges. They give a very generous serving of strawberries and banana on it too, so I always pay the extra couple dollars for the fruit. I always share it with everyone I'm eating with and I still leave full and everyone else decides they're getting the Dutch Baby next time."}
{"text":"This place tops my list of most frequented breakfast/brunch spots.   Pros: - yummy waffles and pancakes - freshly squeezed OJ  Cons: - often 20+ minute wait on weekends - cash only (there's an ATM inside but who wants to be charged a fee? Come prepared) - decor is barebones and outdated  I still fantasize about the strawberry waffle-- thick with crispy edges, fresh strawberries (none of those mushy frozen strawberries that are typically in a thick syrupy sauce that you might get elsewhere), and freshly whipped cream (not rediwhip). It's heavenly. Get it-- you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"They don't have grape jelly and their french fries are I assume pre-packaged and have no flavor. The waffles are always delicious. A nice variety of hot tea options. Our waitress was very friendly and hospitable."}
{"text":"Based in others' reviews waited until after the breakfast rush.  Food and service were good. Pancakes, hash browns, and coffee for under $10."}
{"text":"The Food, service and Hospitality is always THE BEST. they must hire the nicest people to work here. My absolute favorite place to eat the most important meal of the day. Ask for a Julie, she is the sweetest waitress. We love her."}
{"text":"This place is a go to breakfast for me. I've been coming here since 2000 when I moved to Madison. The staff is always quick and friendly. The pancakes are to die for. I always get the bacon ones with my spinach omelet. The omelets are always delicious and baked to perfection. If it's busy be prepared to wait because they make everything by scratch. The only downfall is it's cash only but that's a small price to pay. They do have an atm on site just in case."}
{"text":"After 3 years of driving by this place and smelling it on walks I finally ate here! I went on a Sunday at 9:30 and had a 15 minute wait. The entrance is a bit strange as you walk into basically a small box with a bench.   Inside is better but also lacks some excitement and decoration. But who cares right? Let's get to the food review.  I ordered \"three pigs in a blanket\" and a side of hash browns. They were everything I dreamed of. Three sausages wrapped in pancakes. The pancakes are perfect and so were the sausages. I put a little maple syrup on there and it was delightful and very filling. The hash browns are perfectly flavored. They're more like house fries but no matter what they're called, they're delicious. My friend ordered the blueberry pancakes and some Canadian bacon. He loved both but raved about the Canadian bacon.  The service is very quick but our server was not friendly and gave us the bill before we were halfway done. After we had put the food in the to go box she started giving us the evil eye to get out. As a former server, I get it, the faster a table leaves, the faster you make more tips. But we had been there less than 30 minutes so like, chill. I want to enjoy my coffee!"}
{"text":"It was an okay experience - sure wasn't what I expected . Waitress was hyper and rushed and we kept having to ask for things that she should have known to bring like butter, napkins and a refill of water...  The food was okay - we both ordered steak and eggs - my English muffin was sent back 3 times to get toasted so the eggs were cold by the time I got the hard English muffin back ...  The steak was less than desirable but I was hungry and too tired of asking the waitress for help.  I wouldn't recommend this place - way too much work to get a meal right... It never really was right - just worn out trying ...  Way too much money for the lack of quality and service -"}
{"text":"I've been to OHOP before in Dallas, but have never tried their signature dutch pancakes and thought this was the perfect opportunity for me to try them when my friend came from OKC to visit me in Scottsdale. We were craving pancakes and were excited to find out that there's an OHOP in Scottsdale near Fashion Square, not too far from my apartment in Old Town Scottsdale!  I finally tried the dutch pancake and ordered the Junior Dutch Baby. This pancake was so big and it's the smaller version of the larger original Dutch Pancake! I ordered this and a side of biscuits and gravy.   Service:  My friend and I were seated immediately even though the restaurant seemed pretty busy. It looks like they have more open tables for smaller groups because larger groups of families come here on Sundays for brunch. The waiters were friendly and frequented our table asking to refill our water glasses throughout our brunch.   Food:  *Junior Dutch Baby* the smaller version of the original dutch pancake was still huge! Don't let the name of this fool you. I was only able to eat half of it. I took the other half home. I would say that the dutch pancake tasted like a regular pancake except more eggy.   *Biscuits and Gravy* Two soft and flaky biscuits smothered in sausage gravy. My favorite! I ate half of this and took the other biscuit to-go.  I would highly recommend this place if you don't want to go to IHOP, but are still craving similar breakfast-y type foods. There are a lot of options to choose from the menu. There's something for everyone whether you like a healthy omelet, are craving pancakes and want to stick to the basics, or want to try something new like a dutch pancake."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad service!! Never buying a groupon for this location again."}
{"text":"I have been to the other locations before though it's been awhile (Green Valley Ranch and the Charleston and Decatur locations). Both of those locations have since closed. I was really hoping they would rebuild the one that burnt down on Charleston but last time I drove by another restaurant was being built. Don't know why they still have the address listed on their website if they are not rebuilding. Anyways, I absolutely loved going to OPH. This was the first time I had been to this location. You would think since they only have one location open in the area (Primm doesn't count) they would focus all their attention on it. We arrived and there was a 35 minute wait. Since it was 11am on a Saturday we expected a wait. We finally sat down and our waiter came to take our order. He came back with our drinks and we ordered our food. My son also asked for a glass of water. The place was packed so our waiter was extremely busy. He never brought my son's water and we couldn't seem to catch his attention. Finally when he brought our food we asked again for the water. The food was not cooked how we ordered it so that was disappointing. The waiter was bringing beverages to a table behind us so we managed to get his attention. We asked a 3rd time for my son's water and then asked for refills on our drinks. Finally he brought it out. We saw the manager but unlike other restaurants he never walked around to see how everyone was doing. He just walked between the kitchen and the register several times. Needless to say I don't think I will be coming back especially since it's not near where we live. Would much rather prefer to go to BabyStacks."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great food and huge portions. Love to eat here every time we Re in the South park area around breakfast time"}
{"text":"The Original Pancake House has one item on its menu that absolutely blows my mind, the Apple Pancake. The apple pancake is delicious to the max; well worth the extra wait. A gooey cinnamon glaze, sweet apples, crunchy crust and the enormity of the apple pancake make this item a cannot live without breakfast meal.  I love corn-beef hash and as a side dish the Original Pancake House serves a wonderful homemade hash, not from the can.  I usually wash the apple pancake and homemade hash down with some freshly squeezed orange juice.  On any given day this place is always busy and is one of my favorite breakfast franchises."}
{"text":"love this place! When I was younger I went here with my mom and brother, and now when we visit Charlotte stopping in here never disappoints. The waiters and waitresses are very kind and social, the service is great, the food well priced, and it all tastes so good!"}
{"text":"Nice day for some brunch at the ohop. Meat lovers omelet was great.  The waitress kept forgetting things. We asked for extra napkins twice. First she only bought us 2. Well it was 2 people at the table. Then we asked for more an had to ask 2 times. We come here several times a year. This was unusual for the waitress staff. The food was good."}
{"text":"Been here several times for crepes and Benedict breakfasts...each visit has been less satisfactory than the previous visit.   Venicia Benedict today ...crisp bacon atop spinach on an English muffin with two poached eggs and hollandaise sauce and German potato pancakes with apple sauce ..I like this plate but today the bacon was quite undercooked and the poached eggs were 'nearly' poached, whites and yolks were still clear and runny...'raw'. I ate the cooked parts of the eggs and didn't even attempt the bacon.   I would've sent the plate back to be corrected but my server never stopped to check on me or refill my coffee.   Quite disappointed, again.   Sorry..no more chances.  A shame because I like the German menu items."}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming here. No wait during the week. Fresh food and excellent service though a little pricey. My usual choice is the veggie omelet. I can rarely polish off the whole meal. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Me and my family visited on Sunday at 2:00 pm. We were greeted and seated right away. Our servers name was Alan he was very attentive he kept our drinks filled and came to check on us often. I had strawberry French toast and a side of hash browns. All of it was really good . I only have a four star instead of five because I have two boys a they had pancakes neither ate them they said they taste funny. If you are in the mood for breakfast anytime a day I would recommend it."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with this place! Great service and great, affordable food! This place is a gem in the South Park area.   I highly recommend the Western Omelette. Extremely generous portions. I'd estimate the omelette to be 10 inches in diameter if I recall correctly. Perfect amount and balance of fillings fill the omelette. The best part is how insanely fluffy the omelette is. It really cant get better than this. Best omelette I've had.   I've also had the Eggs Michael. If you're a die-hard Eggs benedict fan, you'll love this creative twist on the classic dish. It's seriously awesome. Mushroom sherry sauce doesn't sound like it'd be good with eggs benedict but it's freaking delicious. Get it. You won't regret it. Also, the potato pancakes that come with this dish are the bees-knees. crispy out the outside yet still has that potatoey stringy hashbrown texture you know and love.   And of course, if you are craving normal eggs benedict, this place does them pretty well too. They do everything right. Perfectly crisp english muffin, perfectly poached egg, perfectly seasoned hollandaise. Not too sweet, not too sour.   One caveat though, ironically, the pancakes here at the Original Pancake House are just okay. I like mine fluffy and moist. These lean a little drier than I prefer.  We always go around 2 or 3 in the afternoon so we never ever run into crowds if you don't feel like waiting. I heard it can get crazy crowded during lunch/breakfast hours."}
{"text":"When I go to a restaurant I usually will eat things the way that restaurant prefers to prepare the food. My only exception to this rule is with breakfast. If I don't want runny eggs, no pulp in my juice,  etc. I recently went to ohp and asked for my omelette to have grilled onions rolled into the finished egg product and the kitchen refused. The waitress came back to my table and said they had there own way of cooking an omelette at which time I promptly removed myself from the establishment. I will never go there again... Well done ohp! This restaurant needs serious training in the customer service department."}
{"text":"My opinion for this place has not changed. We've taken a few friends/relatives here for brunch since my last review, and we continue to be impressed with the food and service. I'm glad they have been consistent in providing excellent quality with their meals and how staff treat their customers."}
{"text":"Absolute best breakfast in town!! Friendly, efficient staff, always perfectly prepared eggs and pancakes. No place better!"}
{"text":"This review is just based on my Apple Pancake, it was AWESOME.  I got the junior size and I ended up giving half of it to my husband.  I wish I had more time before starting my Hcg diet.  I would have loved to try the Dutch Baby, it looked great.  Service was fine, they sent us to the back room since we had the twins, I don't get offended.  My hubby was not thrilled.  Good thing there was a little girl back there with a couple having breakfast. It made it so much fun for the twins.  They had their scrambled eggs and then they devoured most of my hubby's chocolate chip pancakes.  The place is as described by most, kind of 50s dinner vibe.  Good thing we read the reviews and brought cash."}
{"text":"The pancakes are the ONLY thing worth getting.  There are always cooked to perfection and taste great."}
{"text":"Best pancakes in Charlotte , the staff are friendly. Restaurant always is busy .their menu  had Blintz a fill time in the year"}
{"text":"WOW!!!!!!!!! Amazing food! Probably the best breakfast me and my fiancé have ever had! The pancakes were amazing, bacon was cooked very well, and the hash brown was great! Will come again!!!!"}
{"text":"\"We be flipping styles like pancake batter\" - Beastie Boys \"Say It\"  I've lived in Madison for eight years and never gave this institution a shot.  Why not follow with this...  \"You Can't, You Won't And You Don't Stop Ad Rock Come And Rock The Sure Shot\" Beastie Boys \"Sure Shot\"  Enough with song lyrics... it's time to wax on/off about the joint.  The place was packed yesterday an hour before close.  For a table of two, we needed to wait a good 10 minutes.  The decor is somewhere between family style and diner.   There were also plenty of interesting matted and framed photos for sale in the lobby.    After checking out the menu, we settled on omelettes with three buttermilk pancakes.  We love omelettes.  My partner went for a sausage omelette with cheddar and I grabbed the Western (green/red peppers, onion, ham & cheddar).  After about 15 minutes our orders came.    I was a little freaked out about the omelette monstrosity that belonged at a freak show (check out the picture).  Look at that thing?!?!?  It does not look appetizing at all.    I went for it 1st.  It was not greasy and it exploded with steam (likely nuked).  The effing thing was dangerous.  Worse yet, it was not very tasty.  The cheddar formed oddly.  I still have no clue how (combo insanely hot oil frying and microwaving?) or why they cooked an omelette in this fashion.  It was basically a derpy & ginormous Hot Pocket made with an egg shell.   Totally senseless.  Why three stars?  The pancakes were amazing.  Between the delicious warm maple syrup, the intense white butter and the perfectly textured and flavor pancakes, the confusing and mediocre pancakes were almost forgotten. These were the best buttermilk pancakes I have ever had.  To go, I grabbed there corned beef hash (with pancakes).  Although the hash tasted pretty good, it's no Mickies Dairy Bar -- the potatoes were undercooked and bits were raw-ish, the recipe was unspectacular and the corned beef was minced so small there was none of its unique texture.   The service was solid.  Our waitress checked up on us plenty and was very friendly.   On days that I have some patience, I would return ONLY for their pancakes.  In all likelihood, I'll just continue going to IHOP since the prices are about the same, omelettes are a major upgrade and pancakes are only a minor downgrade."}
{"text":"My wife and I live in the Chicago Area and are huge fans of OPH. We were very happy to find OPH in Scottsdale last week as we were in town to look for a potential winter home. The Scottsdale restaurant did not disappoint! We visited twice during the week and both times we had fantastic service with very personable waitresses. My wife always gets the Dutch Baby and it was excellent. I got the Eggs Michael one time and the Mushroom Omelette the next visit.  I have to say the the Mushroom Omelette was not at all greasy and was the best I have ever had at any OPH. You helped us make the decision that we need to get a winter place in Scottsdale. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Very mediocre. There's plenty of places for breakfast in Summerlin/southwest that are better. The eggs and buttermilk pancakes I had were fine. The potato pancakes seemed raw on the inside and were pretty bland. The hollandaise sauce was disgusting and inedible. I'm so glad I ordered it on the side.  The bright spot to our meal was our server. I didn't catch his name but it said Jesse C on the receipt so I'm assuming that it was him. He was efficient and attentive. Got our order perfectly and made sure our coffee and water were always full. He checked on us regularly and I thought he was great."}
{"text":"Came in Saturday for breakfast. They were almost fully packed but seemed to have their shit together. Short wait time and prompt service!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food! Reminds me of a place we have back home in Oregon which is always a good thing! Cheap and good amount of food"}
{"text":"OMG..... you're kidding me.  Took my son and fiance there for breakfast today.  I about fell out of my chair when our bill was 53.00 and change.  The waitress made an error on our ticket that reduced it to 46.00 and change.  But seriously a glass of orange juice $4.95 where did you get those expensive oranges from??  The food was okay but needless to say we will not be going back.  Just be prepared to get shocked at your bill!!"}
{"text":"Simply wonderful.  I love everything about this place, especially the staff.  The barista, I believe his name is Lester, is a long time staple there. His friendly demeanor and terrific service keeps me coming back for that one of a kind, delicious coffee.  Food is delicious as well."}
{"text":"I hate it when it takes 15 minutes to get a cup of coffee. I hate it when i don't ever get a second cup of coffee after waiting so long to get the first. I hate it when you get swedish pancakes, and they overcook them so they're hard and crispy. I hate it when places serve you sausage patties that were cooked a day or two ago, then reheated (and completely dried) for your breakfast. I hate it when your server speaks barely enough english to get by.   I hate it when breakfast places only carry sweet and low (\"they just have the pink kind? really??\") instead of equal or splenda. What decade is this?  This location is by far the worst i've ever been to."}
{"text":"As a chain breakfast joint this place lives up to its promises. Decent food, good service, lots of coffee... I went with a friend on Sunday morning when places like this are usually PACKED but we waited maybe five minutes for a table and our food came out super fast. Quite impressive."}
{"text":"I came here before years ago and it was decent. Not sure if Yelp was around at the time. Wasn't hip to it yet... But today it was \"aight\". I'm sorry but $2.99 for a large orange juice with no refills is a bad start. I know plenty of restaurants like this but then on top of that the Eggs Benedict was HORRIBLE! Taste like egg yolks. Now mind you the hollandaise sauce is mostly egg yolk but it shouldn't taste like it, especially with poached eggs. It was really small and should come with some roasted potatoes. I got the buttermilk pancakes instead of the potato cakes. Considering its a pancake house, they're pretty good... With some strawberries and syrup, it's JUMPIN! So if you come here... just get what it's known for... pancakes."}
{"text":"We were driving around in Charlotte trying to find a place to have breakfast.  My nickname is Turnaround Tina and I didn't disappoint.  Lucy, our garmin, sent us past this breakfast establishment to a lot that is undergoing construction; however, knowing Lucy's quirks I turned around and looked to see if she was off and low and behold found the restaurant.  It was during the week and mid morning so we were seated right way.  This is a tight restaurant using every bit of real estate available.  Our server was very attentive.  The pancakes have a wonderful cake flavor to them.  Almost like cake batter ice cream.  My husband got the cheese omelet.  The omelet seemed to be a little watered down.  I got the feta, mushroom, spinach and tomato omelet and it was loaded with fixings.  However the egg was a little thin.   Overall a good breakfast.  I think we would go with the specialty next time - pancakes."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I'm not a big fan.  Why?  I don't really like pancakes and if you're like me,  the rest of the breakfast menu is ho-hum without 'em.  Big omelets, typical sides, and eggs to order I can get anywhere.  When I dine here it's because someone asked me to join them.  In fairness,  however,  the service and price point is favorable.  I've never declined an invite (even if I'm buying), so if you like pancakes, I say Give 'em a Whirl."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  Nothing special about this place, located in the front parking lot of Motel 6.  We walked in and the first thing I noticed was the CASH ONLY sign and the NO CELL PHONES ALLOWED sign.  I maybe get the cash only thing since it's in close proximity to a Motel 6, but does a casual breakfast diner type establishment have to tell you not to use your cell phone?  The prices do not equal the quality and definitely not the quantity of their food.  I ordered the bacon waffle ($8.50), but it looked more like a pancake waffle (flat) with, I swear, one strip of bacon crumbled on top.  I did not taste any \"bits of bacon\" inside the waffle.  Bleh.  My friend had the strawberry waffle, also flat, which turned out to be the best tasting thing at the table,  The guys both ordered sausage, eggs, hashbrowns, and pancakes.  Pancakes weren't bad, but like I said earlier, nothing special.  One of the hashbrowns was forgotten.  Coffee was good.  Service was friendly but average.  Our bill came out to $40, but honestly it wasn't worth it.  The next morning, we drove a little further and found a Cracker Barrel.  And there you have it."}
{"text":"Ordered the Pecan Waffles, they were decent, I guess you don't come to the Pancake house and order waffles. It was an average breakfast and the service was good as well. I'll have to come back and give them another try."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for a few years due to the proximity of my home and also the baked German pancake. The food is great if you order the baked pancake and so so everything else. What makes this a 1 star as oppose to 5 is the service and attitude. You get the very distinct feeling you must have been working there as oppose to being a paying customer there. They don't handle cash at the table and no exceptions! so if you ran out of change you have to go back to the table to leave a tip cause that is the law there. They do not allow outside coffee there even though they don't offer much in the way of coffee drinks and when you want to tell the owners what you think of these policies, they hand you a card and tell you to leave a message at corporate number on the card? no specific person just corporate number meaning it goes unheard so i figure i post my comment here where everyone will read. I ask the lady how many places do they  have ? when she answer 2 I broke out laughing, what ego the owners must have and now it all makes sense why they treat their customers that way. we eat breakfast at all the locals like black bear, egg and I, hash house ago go and none of them treat you this way so I guess we won't be back as I am not there to report to work. customer service is an art and they do not get it. oh and the other places handle cash and bring change and they don't even mention outside drinks..i mean I guess they are not that desperate for the extra $2 as they are always packed at black bear ( with 20 locations ) and hash house ago go ( with many locations including casino locations which are the most demanding on service and they offer a huge coffee  drink menu and still did not have rules on outside drinks! )."}
{"text":"1 star to vent... I first will say I've been here many times and the food is delicious. BUT... This morning I came in to order their awesome Eggs Michael. It comes with pancakes (which is equivalent on their menu as a half order of pancakes for $7) I politely ask if I can substitute or even pay a little more (even thought it's less) to get a plain waffles ($6). My waitress said no... I argued with her about how it's less in price bla bla bla and firmly said no. I walked... I'm reasonable and understanding with request but cmon!!! This little experience with this lady will make me never come back and go to egg n I or egg works instead"}
{"text":"Love the pancake house.  It's a no frills good inexpensive breakfast.  I recommend their omelettes and their pancakes.  It's great for families.  Looks wise it could probably use a bit of a facelift but I still probably go there once a week"}
{"text":"I went to this place the day after seeing Wicked with some friends several years ago not realizing I'd actually eaten at another location before a good bit with my sister...in Columbia. I don't normally ever get pancakes, but I read they were good here, so I gave them a try. They were super delicious. The last time I went, (about a year ago) I had one of their (HUGE) omelets. You won't go hungry here, the portions are very big. The place is always packed, but we've always managed to get seated fairly quickly considering the (sometimes) long lines outside and the service is pretty good (orders, coffee refills, etc.). I'll be going back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Probably the only place to get truly good pancakes in CU, The Original Pancake House has an extensive menu of favorites like blueberry and new creations like oatmeal. Not Walker Brothers up north, but these satisfy.  The major problem here is the crowds. On the weekends expect to wait a pretty long time. Eggs here are also worth skipping...they just don't taste like they are made fresh with butter, which is the only way breakfast eggs should be cooked."}
{"text":"A great place for breafast!  Super yummy.  The eggs bebdict and potato pancakes were wonderful!  The apple pancake was amazing but definitly not for breakfast.  It was more like an apple skillet bread pudding than a pancake.  But I love bread pudding so all and all it was still deliscious.  All items on the menu looked good and the place was clean and trendy.  The staff was really nice as well.  We will definitely make this a regular stop when we are in SC.  This is a definite gem!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite breakfast spots. I do kind of wish it was open later but I'll take what I can get. The food is always fresh and hot and my order is always right. I see the same smiling faces working there week after week so employees must like their jobs. The entire facility is very clean, including the bathrooms. I have nothing but good things to say about this restaurant and this location for anybody up in this area this is a must stop for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"We visited for breakfast over the weekend and were pleasantly surprised! Service was speedy and our food was delicious. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing but the Bacon......Hard and burned! I thought maybe it was just my bacon but everyone's looked like mine. I get that thick bacon is what's \"hot\" now but does it need to be burned to a crisp??"}
{"text":"We ate here the lady time we stayed at the motel 6 behind it, but last time it was much better. This time I got an omelette, which was crazy fluffy, but tasted like nothing. I pretty much just enjoyed my pancakes, which are pretty tasty. Husband got a different omelette, thought the same. Very unexciting. Fluffy heavenly blandness.  Next time, I will get fancy pancakes...I should have known by the name what I should be getting."}
{"text":"Vibes here is like a old fashion diner. Older crowd and families great place for brunch. Almost everything on the menu is $10+ so don't expect a quick eat it's more for the person who is looking to start the day right. The main reason I come here is for the 49er crispy corners and gooey center with warm buttery syrup goodness. Perfecto!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Everyone's super friendly. The food is always out quick, has been right every time I've gone, and is delicious. Not to mention the portions are huge for a great price. I would definitely recommend trying the buttermilk pancakes (they come as a side with some dishes) as they're amazing. The environment is really laid back and you'll see people in suits or in their pajamas."}
{"text":"I realize I have a soft spot for diners, but this is truly a wonderful little spot! I come here for warm fuzzy feelings and delicious breakfast foods. It can get get pretty busy if the weather isn't terrible, so get here early if you're coming in for brunch.   I've had a few different types of pancakes - all delicious. The waffles are also pretty good. The last time I was here, I had the peach crepes and they felt a little eggy... which maybe would be fine for most people, but I'm not a huge egg-person. Speaking of eggs, they have a fun way of making their omelets and my friends, who like eggs, seem to really enjoy them!"}
{"text":"The food was good! Definitely get more bang for your buck here with prices ranging around 10 and they give you more than enough food. I ordered the vegetarian omelette which came with 3 pancakes and walked out stuffed. The service was great even from the managers walking by."}
{"text":"What a fun little place in Scottsdale! My family went for breakfast this morning and enjoyed chocolate chip pancakes, little piggies, egg white omelets, and biscuits and gravy. All were delicious. In fact, while I make some pretty darn good pancakes, I will admit that these are better than mine. So much so, that I can't wait to go back. The service was excellent, friendly, and prompt. Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Its pancakes, you eat one, then you are sick of them...until they put BACON in it...this place has pancakes of all shapes and every stupid thing you can put on or in it.  Its basically a glorified IHOP but done way better.  Its basically a solid place to sponge up all the liquid pollution you put in you're body the night before.  No frills, just good diner breakfast...and if you came here for lunch, well you are a turd, eat some pancakes"}
{"text":"I live near this restaurant and always wondered if it was good, on Easter morning I decided to try it out.  The food is super bland, over priced and over-cooked.  Does that look like a \"ham steak\"?? I would have been better off going through a McDonald's drive thru - disappointing!!!"}
{"text":"Always a fantastic breakfast.  Great food and service!  I love this place and make sure it starts my day in the big city of Charlotte."}
{"text":"I was at the restaurant this morning with my two children. Although the wait was not too long, I was glad there were children's books available to pass the time.  Our server was nice, and the food was average. My biggest complaint was the price. I had a cup of tea, and my son had a watered down juice. Both were $2.25. I've never had such an expensive cup of tea, and it was not very good. We ordered a side of bacon, which had 4 strips, and it was $4.75.  I won't be going back. Not because the food wasn't good. But because it's just not worth the price."}
{"text":"OPH is my favorite brunch spot in all of Charlotte. I tend to rotate between three excellent dishes: strawberry french toast, eggs benedict, and swedish crepes. Their strawberries are always fresh and sweet and I can't get enough of their homemade whipped cream. I always get seated quickly, even during their busy weekend mornings, and the service never fails to be great. No complaints, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Apple pancakes were awesome! Disappointed in the swedish pancakes but quality of food was definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"I think this place would've been +4 star if they had NOT run out of fresh strawberries..   I have Yelped, of course, to find a good breakfast / crepe place & found this place.  So I go out of my way to drive my semi-drunk azz to here, which is located appx 1 mile west of 15 Fwy.. Waited, appx 15 minutes & ordered my Crepe..   Waitress tells me \"we're sorry but just ran out of fresh strawberries...\" dang it.  So I ordered Crepes w/ banana, which was good but since I did not crave banana crepe, it didn't quite made me content..   She was however, very attentive & even came by to see if I liked the sub order..  Kept re filling my coffee w/out asking was nice too..  I may try again next time when in LV.."}
{"text":"Really good food, but is a bit overpriced. Of course the service is always excellent and the food never disappoints, so that makes up for it. However sometimes the portions are too big, but I guess that's not really a downside. All in all, a good family friendly delicious spot, that's constantly busy"}
{"text":"This is one of those places where you love it, you leave, you crave the food and want to go back but it's only been like....what....two hours? Weirdo.  Wee had an omelet, fruit bowl, and pecan pancakes. IT WAS AMAZING. It's so hard for me to finish eating all the food on my plate and let me tell you...I inhaled it. Especially the pancakes! Best pancakes I've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and service was good! A great place for brunch! I had the chorizo omelette and strawberry pancakes and freshest squeezed O.J! It was all so good! Great experience will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This fine breakfast establishment is right next to my work and I am lucky enough to get to go there often.  Even if I go for work with a large group the service is good, the food is great, and the prices are very fair.  Most times when we go with a large group they give us one of their famous Apple Pancakes for free!  The Pancake house does not accept credit or debit cards,  it is cash or check only.  They also STRONGLY suggest you do not use  your cell phone while you are in the restaurant.  This policy alone warrants 5 stars.  They have signs all over the place advising of their request for this courtesy, which should be common, but some people are VERY important in case you did not know.  I have never had anything here that did not impress me."}
{"text":"I always get the eggs Benedicts the hashbrowns are awesome too... tried some of their omelets they are super fluffy. never had a bad meal there since it opened."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Charlotte. Reasonably priced & friendly service! I've been here about 20 times now and they never disappoint! Sometimes when a restaurant has a wait... It's because they are that good!"}
{"text":"I ate here the other day and I am not sure if it was just that day that there was something wrong, but the pancakes that I had were horrible, they tasted like pure yeast and not any way like pancakes should taste. The rest of the food was alright, but if they can't serve me decent pancakes why bother!"}
{"text":"Went there this past weekend with friends from out of town. Seating was fast, the service was SUPER courteous and speedy. Our waitress checked with us every 10 minutes or so and refreshed coffee and water right on time.  This was my first visit to one in NC but I was a big fan in GA. I will be going back. There are few places where you get such great service with such HUGE plates of food. Strawberry waffles are next on my list!"}
{"text":"Really good morning spot the pancakes are really good, all the plates look delicious i got a skillet and i was really happy with my dish.  Our waiter was amazing check up on us constantly and make sure we had everything we neeeded. The bad thing is they close at around 2.30pm other then that i love it."}
{"text":"Yum!!!!  For breakfast there is no place better, except the other OPH on University, not better equal.  Omelettes are huge, baked so they're fluffy and lots of ingredients.  A favorite is asparagus with tomato and feta.  Bacon, what can I say?  Thick-cut, smokey, nine better!  Crepes- the cherry is great.  Every item is delicious and quality ingredients.  Most egg items come with a side of buttermilk pancakes, which are good.  Yes this is a chain, but they are so picky and precise on their food it's amazing!  Apple pancake is huge and to die for!!!"}
{"text":"I just don't get the appeal of this place. My mom loves it and if the lines out the door are any indication everyone else loves it as well. Every time I've been here the place has been packed and cramped and the food is nothing to really write home about. I make better breakfast at home. Now that being said, it's not bad either. It's a decent breakfast spot if that's what you're craving. I just don't see why it's a die hard spot to eat at."}
{"text":"This place has gradually gone down hill over the years. Two weeks ago I They gave me raw eggs in my omelet this time they gave me cheap and nasty Costco bacon with fuzz on it and wouldn't refund me my money because I ate half of it before I noticed. It's cool I'm not coming here anymore and would suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"I'm a regular. I'm here every Saturday, and I always sit in Charlet's section. She's great (as I'm sure the others are, too, but I'm loyal to her). The coffee is good and the pancakes are big and tasty. You have to get the potatoes. There are seasoned and cooked to perfection! I've only every eaten breakfast here - regadless of the time of day - but I've seen the kitchen dish out soups, salads and sandwiches and they all look good, too."}
{"text":"Excellent. None to compare. Every bite is more delicious than before. A treat beyond belief!"}
{"text":"I have found my new go-to breakfast spot! Usually very busy but the wait is never long. Super nice employees and service is quick. The menu is huge and has something for everyone! I get gluten free pancakes (which are delicious) with hash browns and bacon."}
{"text":"Awesome! Had the Eggs Benedict with chorizo patties and potatoe pancakes- wow! Loved this. The simple eggs, thick sliced bacon with pancakes was delicious, too! Thanks yelpers for the great recommendation!!! A must when I visit Charlotte again!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Phoenix since 1986 and this was my first time at the Original Pancake House.....if it's another 32 years before I'm back it'll be too soon. We had to wait 35 minutes for a table.  Then it took 40 minutes to get our food.  When I said something to Jessica, our server, she said \"yeah its taking longer than usual\"...... No apologies, nothing.  We said something to the cashier and she had already run our card so she gave us $6 from the register.  That was for our $41 bill for 2 people.  I'll never come back again.  Screw this place and screw Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot if you want your money's worth. All of the things on their menu are huge portions and won't leave you still feeling hungry. I recommend the strawberry crepes and the Dutch baby !"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is really good.  My husband, who isn't a big breakfast eater really like this place too.  Service is quick and friendly.    They have the best pancakes I've ever tasted, good thick cut bacon, you can't go wrong with whatever you order.  And it's not too expensive."}
{"text":"Belgian Pecan Waffle and coffee were great. Wouldn't normally think of diner coffee as great, but it was smooth and the perfect drinking temp. Waffle was delicious! The waffle and coffee came to $10 something, but my friend got the pumpkin pancakes (served all year) which was much cheaper. She orders them everytime.  Misc.: The parking lot was full and drivers were getting testy at about 9am on a Sunday. They recently got new coffee mugs that are super cute (and you can buy them). Diners pay their check at the register. They offer table-side stands for baby carriers."}
{"text":"Forget IHOP - this place is where it's at! Fresh squeezed orange juice, amazing food, fast and friendly service! I'd never had buckwheat pancakes but they were incredible! Eggs Benedict were great and aren't on a lot of menus, so they were a nice treat. Wish we had this place back home in KY!"}
{"text":"Located at Sharon Corners (behind Harper's/McD's) is some superfantastic breakfast eats!  I had it in my head that OPH was going to be 1. expensive, because Southpark and 2. crazy crowded.  On a weeknight around 7:00, I was wrong on both counts.  Now, don't get it twisted - on the weekends, this place stays at full capacity, but the Tuesday dinner crowd was light, seemingly consisting of mostly regulars.    With a prime corner spot in the shopping center, parking is plentiful but the lot is crammed and the spots are on the narrow side (for those of us killing the planet in our SUV's).  I was warmly greeted when I entered and promptly seated.  My waiter came over immediately to get my drink order, came back a moment later and I was ready to order.  My food came out very quickly, and was smoking hot.  My food: 2 eggs over well - cooked perfectly.  Eggs were fresh and delicious. 4 slices of turkey bacon - it seemed to be Butterball?  It tasted exactly like what I make at home, only it wasn't burned like I always manage to do.   3 pancakes - so good, so very very good.  Fluffy, not crazy sweet - with butter and some ample pours of the warm syrup, I could have eaten my body weight in these pancakes and I find myself craving them.  The total for my meal, without tip, was $8 (I had water to drink).  The food was delicious, service was wonderful, the gentleman who seemed to be the boss that evening was very pleasant.  I will definitely return to OPH."}
{"text":"Rules. Rules. And more Rules!  No cell phones. No incomplete parties. No credit cards. (cash only) No firearms. No outside drinks allowed in. No to go orders on weekends & holidays. No smoking. (which is a city law) So if you can handle all of this, the food is pretty good. oh yeah... btw.. if you would like to try the blueberry syrup then be prepared to pay $1.75 for a 2 Tbsp. serving of smashed blueberries mixed with pancake syrup... They didn't tell me it was extra and I found it quite disappointing to pay so much for so little."}
{"text":"These are the best pancakes I ever had. The plates are huge, and there was no way I could finish my meal. However I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service...had the owner yelling, put his finger in my gf's face. It's too bad he couldn't even look at my plate to see the hair on it. Never... ever go here."}
{"text":"This place usually has a line on Sunday for brunch/lunch but that day was different.  Maybe the economy really is hitting Vegas hard.  Pros:  The classic baked apple pancake was tasty and delicious but it seems to be smaller than the last time we had it and was burnt on the bottom.  The side of potato pancakes were good and I liked them served with the applesauce.  Cons: The venecia benedict is not as good as their regular eggs benedict since the sauteed mushrooms and spinach were oily and ruined the hollandaise sauce."}
{"text":"I am a fan of  the Original Pancake House locations. I have visited Redondo Beach, Anaheim, Poway, and Las Vegas.   What sets this location apart from the others is the bacon. The bacon here is the best!! It's nice and thicker than the other franchises...the best I've had...EVER!!! When I asked the waitress why their bacon was different, she said it's because they special order it.   -Kudos to you OPH Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Even though we came doing a busy time we sat down pretty quick if he sees our food at a reasonable time. The food was hot customer service was awesome thank you"}
{"text":"My favorite pancakes are made here. I choose the 49ers. They are thin and when buttered with syrup are out of this world. Large as a plate"}
{"text":"Will not return. Nothing special about their pancakes, I could make something better at home and their prices are outrageous. also we waiting a long time just to get our drinks. Not happy. Baby stacks is way better, only came here because they were closed."}
{"text":"If I ever feel the need to indulge on breakfast, this is the place I go. We stopped in this past weekend and had a feast that carried us through the rest of the day. Every time we come in, I ALWAYS order the orange juice and finally noticed the price today, nearly $5! Okay, the orange juice is definitely the most delicious orange juice I've had, but for $5, I can buy myself a bag of oranges and make 3 cups of orange juice.   We ordered a vegetarian omelet with Gouda and it is SO good!!! I always get this every time I come and can easily share this with my husband and still be super full. It has mushrooms, tomatoes, broccoli, onions, and peppers (I think) and delicious melty Gouda all over it. The best part is probably the hardened cheesy crust on top that contrasts with the soft fluffy omelet containing all those fresh veggies inside. This came with a side of pancakes which is a given to be decent since pancake is in the name.   My husband ordered chocolate crepes which has yummy crepe batter surrounding chocolate, strawberries, and a mound of whipped cream on top. I'm not a sweet breakfast person, but if you are, this is bliss. We packed this to go and was still delicious at 10PM.   Lastly, I always order potato pancakes which are like hash browns in pancake form. They're usually really crispy on the outside and softer on the inside but the ones I got were all a bit soggy and unseasoned this time around. If you order these, make sure to get the sour cream! It sounds weird, but it's so delicious.   So, even though my potato pancakes weren't as perfect as usual, this will always be my go-to breakfast place on days when I don't want to cook breakfast, lunch, or dinner!"}
{"text":"Pretty big disappointment for me after all these great reviews praising pancakes of the Gods. Everything here seems pretty average to me, only slightly ahead the likes of Cracker Barrel. I compare it to Cracker Barrel not because it has a ton of crap all over the place and a tacky gift shop, but because the food is pretty flavorless except when they decide to heap on the sugar.  Had the famous apple pancake. Which does have a delicious apple cinnamon topping, but on top of a thick, spongy, bizarre apple pancake. I'm definitely not a fan of the pancake base and the whole thing made me OD on apples and sugar. I think it would be better just to have the spiced apples on the side of a dish.  The omelets are amazingly fluffy and flavorless. I had cheddar in my omelet, right?  For good measure, we ordered some coconut pancakes on the side with the omelet. Pretty average pancakes with a little bit of coconut mixed in and some intensely pineapple syrup. Again I ODed on pineapple without any good pancake substance.  I'm guessing the people who love this place are more into sugary toppings on their pancakes, while I am in it for the cake experience.  Coffee also tasted like it came from Denny's.  To aggravate the situation, this location has all the atmosphere of a Village Inn on sugar roids. Elderly patrons trying to clank there way through all the crowded tables with their walkers, angry Scottsdale douche bags yelling about how stupid it is for a restaurant to not take credit cards, church-goers sequestering large sections for a apple God chasers, and morbidly obese patrons with fashion statements like Tinkerbell sweat pants with a hot pink shirt and crocs and a rainbow Coach purse. It all just made me wish I went to the Good Egg at Park Central Mall instead. Would've cost less too."}
{"text":"Because the parking lot is small we parked at the Target parking deck down the road and walked up. The food was great (pecan pancakes and pigs in a blanket w/ eggs). Our server (Madisen) was polite, quick and attentive. We will be back."}
{"text":"I could never give this place less than 5 stars. They accommodate larger groups in the small space, pricing is fantastic (especially for being in South Park), DELICIOUS food, friendly staff, the wait is never unbearable, and frankly, I just love it. For a brief period of time, I wanted to become a franchisee of an OPH and bring it to Fort Mill. I couldn't imagine any possible reason why it wouldn't be successful. I've been to one in Savannah, too. Equally as busy and delicious. When I visit, I visit on Sundays. So, always prime time, busy and fresh. I've still never gotten the wrong order, had to send something back for being undercooked, had a hair in my food...NONE of the common complaints when a restaurant it slammed.  Frankly, if I could sleep in a bed of chocolate chip pancakes and whipped cream (fresh, hand whipped), I might never get up. If you didn't figure out that chocolate chip pancakes are my favorite from that sentence, I'm equally as concerned for you as you now are for me. The hash browns are NOT the fried strips of preprocessed potato flakes. You're going to get real potatoes chopped into chunks, seasoned and sautéed with onion; a masterpiece. I've been here several times and will use anyone visiting or who hasn't been, as an excuse to go. With a HUGE menu, genuine staff and amazing food, you MUST stop here. They have locations everywhere, too. I've found that each location has a a few slightly different options too. Like, Savannah had Reese's Cup pancakes.  Not sure I'll ever get a picture for this review though. Once my food hits the table, it gets in my belly, do not pass go, do not collect $200, ain't no time for that! I'll see what I can do but likely, you'll all have to enjoy an image of me chowing down like a linebacker!"}
{"text":"Getting breakfast in Charlotte?  Don't even think about going anywhere else, get here early to avoid the wait.  There is a reason so many people wait for this tasty meal, the pancakes are ON POINT.  The 49er that I got was almost like a crepe, it was very thin, but packed full of delicious buttery goodness.  While the staff may not be overly friendly, our server Rob was effective, and I would rather have good food fast, than sacrifice quality for some cheesy jokes.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast. I think it's open until 2pm so dinner is definitely out. This am I arrived and was quickly seated ... And it took a little while longer than normal for the server to arrive. No big deal. Not in a hurry at the present time. When she arrived she was very nice and professional.  Food and coffee is always great here. I enjoyed their famous apple pancake for hers and years. Since then, I've switched to ordering a ham and cheese omelette with a small stack do pancakes.  Noticed that their guest wifi was on today.  That's a good thing. It wasn't on last week when I was in the restaurant.  The omelette was piping hot and oozing with cheese. Years ago (not sure nowadays) their menu said the omelets were made from 6 eggs. The size of it suggests it still is. I think the omelette is also cooked in a oven instead of in a pan or grill.   The panclocks (pancakes as termed in the movie \"50 First Dates\" by Drew Barrymore) were great as usual.  A very good and tasty meal."}
{"text":"BEST PANCAKES IN TOWN. This place is by far my favorite bfast/brunch spot. And their pancakes are better than any brunch location out there (NYC included). If you want to avoid the wait, go later in the afternoon. I would highly recommended their strawberry pancakes, they're out of this world."}
{"text":"I ask you what would you do when you go and pick your red Ferrari up? What is the first thing you do in that car? Put the top down, turn the bass up, light your cigarrette, and what? Go to the Original Pancake House (OPH as me and my Vegas crew call it). That's what I do. And I'm not playing.   I'm driving on the freeway with one thing in mind. My challah french toast. I want my front parking spot, why I don't know because none of the spots there are in the shade at all, and want my breakfast. Thick slices of beautiful challah, dipped and cooked up all perfect with some strawberries. Oh, my strawberries, yes please. Extra please. Throw down some coffee with that, a little O.J. ya'll and watch your fingers. If you get too close to my toast you're gonna lose a hand. I'll even take an extra order to go knowing that they don't do takeout orders. That way I know I'll be totally taken care of in three hours, when my sugar high has crashed and I know I want more. I've even had my french toast with a glass of Chateau D'Yquem. That's sick. And it was delicious.  The service is fast, they have conveniently located restaurants. They close early, I think about 2:30 pm, so get your hungover asses outta bed and get some breakfast. It's a whole hell of a lot better than that IHOP shit they're always trying to feed us. I know it's not Waffle House guys, but that's a whole different story."}
{"text":"While glancing the menu at OPH, we noted that 'challah french toast'  was on the menu. My friend the Host With the Mostest in Las vegas (HWMLV), whom I have known for over half of my life, claimed he did not know this word, \"challah\"!  Nutters!   Since college, I had the chance to attend my share of break Fasts, Seders, etc... so 'challah' to me was just another baked good from the Noe Valley Baking company. Everyone knows that, right? Or so I thought!   Thank you, HWMLV, for knowing about the two for one deal from the paper. I'm all about the cheap eats.. and I'm all abou the OPH.  Yum, yum, yum. Come hungry and for the best selection: SHARE!   Their Apple Pancake: There is no reason why one human should be consuming ONE of these in one sitting by themselves. (I'm scared to even ask about the nutritional value of it, but eating ONE would be akin to eating 4-5 apple fritters. At least.)   Their house specialty is this apple pancake (see pic above), created with care and it comes out hot, fluffy and much like an apple pastry. IN any case, it's a must try, in my book.   Cinnamony and chewy, it's a nice start to the day (even though we got started kinda late, but you know Vegas)   We also split the eggs benedict (see pic above) which comes with a side of 4 potato pancakes. Yummy, but these thin potato pancakes were thin crepe like concoctions... unlike the thick fried patties of goodness I remember from my college days.  No worries, it was still quite tasty.   NOTE: the applesauce and sour cream that arrive with your meal is the accompaniment to the potato pancakes. Just FYI. I think you all knew that though.   The eggs benedict hollandaise sauce was quite yellow and eggy, but the balance of ham/egg/english muffin was perfect...   NEXT time we're going to share the Dutch Baby Pancake.  Reminder. It's not Dutch BOY. That's a Paint.   But I think you all know that, too."}
{"text":"I think Original Pancake House is one of the few restaurants which we took for granted and never reviewed it till now.  That's because its SOOOOO GOOOOOD.  Its a perfect brunch place for a Sunday or a weekend, at least to us.   It is no news that their pancakes are to die for.  Super soft, super fluffy and super flavorful, especially with their homemade maple syrup and fresh cream and fruit toppings.  We have tried most of their pancakes and loved them all.  In our recent visit I order a french toast, its a cinnamon nut French toast with sautéed apples and fresh cream and WOW was it good.  Felt like IT was the answer to my Sunday brunch craving loaded with carbs and no protein lol. 4 loafs of bread generously drenched in eggs and seared, topped with enough cinnamon (which I love) and pecan and roasted almonds and a huge dollop of super fresh cream.  Loved the fresh cream because it is not too sweet and smells super fresh.   Wife's egg benedicts was just awesome (that's what she said).  English muffin, a thick layer of Canadian bacon and poached egg topped with hollandaise and you get two of these in an order with pancakes.  this is always a go-to place for us, rings in mind by default when we crave for Sunday brunch.  Even though we know we have to wait for a while to get a table, we still go here, wait outside, bear the hunger, scream at each other as it was their fault to choose this place, keep silent for a while, anxiously check our mobile phones, eagerly waiting to hear those words from the front desk \" Dee, party of 2 \" and everything changes. :)"}
{"text":"Down in a hold behind the McDonald's on Fairview Ave across from South Park Mall is one of the Original Pancake restaurants.  Hard to find, but an excellent place for breakfasts and lunches.  My 98 year old dad really loves pancakes so this is his place when we have medical appointments at Novant Senior Care next door.    The host and servers are always courteous and friendly.  With my dad, once they see the walker the host will acknowledge the walker to others waiting and put dad into a seat right away.  We are more than willing to wait our turn, but that courtesy is much appreciated.  Apparently this is a standard they regularly maintain for your floor staff and my guess is that they look to hire people with this courtesy attitude.   We get fast and efficient service and one unique item is the apple or cherry crepe.  Dad can wolf down, well...maybe not wolf, but can consume almost all of this three crepe order by himself.  It is that good.  He also likes pancakes with a fried egg, which he puts in between two pancakes.  They really do have good meals here and the prices are very reasonable.  Parking is in the strip mall lot, so you might have to park and walk a bit to get to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Blueberry pancakes to die for! The Madison location needs to get with the times as far as payment. They will take cash only. They have an ATM in the restaurant charging $2.00 for each use. In the year 2016 a popular restaurant should be able to factor into their menu pricing, the cost of doing business with debit and credit cards!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I remember going to the OPH near Detroit when I was kid.  I never realized they were a chain until I moved to WNY and they had three loactions there, which were all just as good.  I was happy to see the two locations in Charlotte when I moved here.  This chain has a lot going for it - especially fresh food AND consistency.    This one is a good location but gets very busy on the weekends.  The food is always fresh and the service is also good, plus you cannot beat the price.  The food tastes a lot more \"real\" than IHOP and Waffle House and it's just overall a better experience."}
{"text":"Today we had the cherry crepes, baked western omelet, and pancakes we shared this for 2 people. Fabulous perfect be sure to ask for the salsa it tops of the omelet. Bridgette was our waitress and she was fast and super nice."}
{"text":"We were so impressed.  These people (owners and staff) really get it when it comes to good food and good service.  We were surprised at how crowded it was and our party of six only had to wait about 20 minutes.  We were greeted warmly and served right away.  The food was terrific!  Our sincere thanks go out to this wonderful neighborhood restaurant!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was amazing so much to chose from and tbe portions are large!!! Fast but quality service. An oldie but definitely a goody"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the largest omelets I have ever seen!  Two people can definitely share. The omelets are light and fluffy. We also tried the French toast with apple spice syrup that was yummy too. There is usually a line here on weekends so try to go during the week day if possible. The wait team is very friendly. I love this place."}
{"text":"With pancake selections that range from bacon to coconut to sourdough to Swedish, this chain pancake house is amazing and puts IHOP to serious shame.  Do not miss their specialties of the house- the apple and the Dutch baby!  Oh thank you Eva S. for introducing me to OPH!"}
{"text":"The perfect ambience for New Years Day breakfast. The fireplace was on. The mantel was beautifully decorated with Christmas decorations which they took down after lunch. Rather odd since Im used to seeing decorations up until a week after new year.   The place was packed for lunch but miraculously I was seated within 10 minutes of checking in. And I was seated with a beautiful view of the fireplace no less. I recommend the swedish pancakes. They're light and tasty, served piping hot with a side of linconberry and fresh butter. They looked like crepes and tasted better than ones I had in Amsterdam. Amazing. Being extremely hungry, I added a full order of biscuits with gravy, home fries, and scrambled eggs. It came out really cheesy. The biscuits were light & fluffly and the gravy was just the right consistency, served with bacon bits inside.   The ambience was what you would expect in a family style restaurant and really cozy. Service was wonderful. Great place to start the year on a good foot with a great breakfast. It really made my day special."}
{"text":"I could go with either two or three stars.  Restaurant was 3/4 full; time from seating to food arrival was 40 minutes.  I had the spinach crepe, which was bland.  The potato pancakes that came with it were too sour.  Kitchen made the wrong dish for two of the table's orders.  Options were to accept incorrect food or wait (even longer) for correct food to be made.  Ugh.  To top it off, when I went to use the restroom, they were out of toilet paper.    Things to know: they are closed on Tuesdays, no credit cards, omelets come with 3 pancakes (unless you specify toast), and omelets are four-egg.  This is all stated on the menu, etc., but people still seem to miss them.  Oh, and the online menu is different than the actual menu (some items are missing but the in-person menu is much larger)."}
{"text":"Delish Sunday brunch mom and pop breakfast spot. Friendly staff, great value for the size of portion, and lively atmosphere. Great spot for a Sunday morning date. Get there early or you might have to wait! (To be seated)"}
{"text":"Best service, best food, best prices! I am happy everytime I come here. Friendly staff and authentic, delicious food! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here at this restaurant and it was pretty good, despite the wait and the cigarette smoke......ugh!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here today with my Cousin, childhood friend and of course the Mrs.  We arrived at about 9:30 and had a 15 minute wait. It was a good way to catch up with the family.   When we were seated our waitress Teresa came right over to take our drink orders. She was also very helpful answering any questions we had about the menu.   After deliberating over the menu my wife had the Jr plate (three pancakes, one egg and two sausage links). I had the buckwheat pancakes with scrambled egg beaters and corned beef hash.   My cousin had the two by four platter and my friend had the pigs in a blanket. (I was tempted to try the Dutch baby as mentioned in other reviews but then I would have needed a nap).   Everyone was very satisfied with their food. You get a lot of great food for a great value. When we left there was a thirty minute wait and now I know why. Timing is everything when coming here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing,  you should expect a wait but it is worth it.  My 2 favorites are the apple waffle and the hash browns and eggs.  Make sure to order them extra crispy.   Be careful when the hash browns come out as the middle will be very hot.    The service can get busy at times but everyone is always nice and they get to know you as well.  This place is worth becoming a regular at."}
{"text":"OPH is a solid breakfast/brunch destination with good prices in Charlotte (and beyond - they have locations all over the states). Get ready to wait during prime times. But once you get your table (put your name in online before you arrive to shave off some time), order a coffee and the dutch baby with fruit and be satisfied."}
{"text":"This place generally has very good food, but the service is a little slow. I really like their sausage and their omelets are awesome. The main reason I only gave it three stars was due to the unfriendly staff. The woman that was handling our table was rude and poor mannered. We went here on the recommendation of a friend and again, the food was good, but they really need to train their staff better. The bathrooms are clean and the restaurant as well kept, but they could also use a little bit better parking Arrangements."}
{"text":"The decor is very plain and looks like something out of the 60's. The food is really good. Cooked fresh to order. They have the best plain pancakes I have ever had. They have changed their policy and are now accepting credit cards which is a plus. The downside is they increased their prices significantly. I ordered 2 eggs (scrambled), 3 sausage links which came with 3 pancakes. It was almost 9 dollars. I had a side of hash browns and coffee. The bill was just over $13.50. The price is way too expensive for what I got. The food is good but it's much like the decor, plain. There are many good breakfast places in Scottsdale which offer a much more for that kind of money. This place used to be my go to place for breakfast but not anymore. If the prices were more in line with what you get I would continue to eat here. I would also change their rating to 5 stars."}
{"text":"FIlthy parking lot, attached to the Motel 6, didn't even look open. Had to turn around and leave. Yuck."}
{"text":"The Original Pancake House is tucked away in the corner of Goldwater and Camelback. It's a part of the Motel 6 which kind of makes it hard to find parking during their peak hours.   I arrived there at 10:30 and there was no line to get in. But there were a lot of people already seated. My friend and I were sat immediately, but didn't get any drink orders for 10 minutes and didn't get our food order for another 20 minutes. While waiting for our server to take our order, i noticed that they didn't take credit or debit cards, which happened to be the only thing i had. Luckily for me, they had an ATM machine that had a $2.50 service charge.  When our server finally took our order. I ordered the Biscuits and gravy and my friend ordered the Apple pancakes. The biscuits and gravy plate was only 5 bucks and was enough to fill me up, but i don't think it would be able to fill up someone who would be REALLY hungry. The apple pancake was HUGE! It's just one really large pancake enough for two people to eat.  If you're looking for a cheap breakfast place to eat, this is a good place to go. But as far as service, you'd have to have a little bit a patience. And don't forget to bring your cash because they don't take cards, they're so old fashioned that they accept personal checks!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to get breakfast in Madison.  Plan to go slightly hungry, because they serve A LOT! But beware of the weekends.  There will be a wait on the weekends.  But the wait is worth it. Make sure to try the fresh squeezed orange juice, the 49'er flap jacks, and the hashbrowns well done with cheese.  I have loved the omlettes and pancakes and getting the dutch baby is always a treat.  But I always go a little hungry so I am always thwarted by the note for extra wait on the dutch babys.   The service we have recieved at this location has always been awesome.  We have gone to the other location once and that was enough.  We much prefer this location and make the drive out to the west side for this breakfast pretty frequently.  It's definately worth it.   We have taken our son many times since he was born, he is now 14 months and they have always been extra considerate to our needs with him.  One time they even gave us a larger booth so he could continue sleeping in his car seat.  :-) Also, I brought my family here when they were visiting from Canada and they still talk about this place, a year later.  They are coming in a couple of days and we will be returning."}
{"text":"I've always looked forward to going to an Original Pancake House. This was my first visit to an OPH outside of Illinois. I ordered the spinach omelette with a side of bacon and of course pancakes. The omelette was supposed to have cheese in it, and if it did the amount was so small that I couldn't taste it. It wasn't very flavorful, but the bacon and pancakes were on point. Beware that they have a tiny little parking lot that fills up quickly. Service was quick and they refilled coffee regularly. My sister ordered the coconut waffles....one word....YUM!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place until a friend of mine mentioned it. One Sunday morning all 4 of us (2 couples) headed to the Original Pancake House. When we first entered we endured a bit of a wait after claiming a number. That's ok though as they have a local photographers work posted all over the front. The waiting area is very small though and should be expanded.   We waited maybe 30 minutes and finally our number was called. We sat down and a waitress immediately stopped by to get our drink order. I had the orange juice which is fresh squeezed and delicious. It reminds me of the juice from either Jennifer Street Market or Willy Street Co-op, I don't recall. The other three had apple juice which I was told was just \"Ok.\"   I had to get the original style pancakes as that's what they are famous for. My fiancee had the chocolate pancakes with chocolate chips. She did not like them, the problem is the menu makes it sound like regular pancake batter with chocolate chips inside. What comes out is way too much chocolate.   My other couple enjoyed strawberry pancakes and a gigantic Western Omelet. I had a slice of the Western Omelet and it was perfect. It wasn't watery and it had plenty of bell peppers.   The food only took about 10-15 minutes to bring out and the service was great. We will definitely go back here as the breakfast food was awesome minus the chocolate chip pancakes."}
{"text":"I generally avoid chain restaurants but I've been addicted to this one since the original Walker's Pancake House was featured in the movie \"Ordinary People\" in the 80s.  The reason is simple...they have the most unbelievable omelettes.  I've tried to replicate them at home to no avail, so I have to keep coming back.  The baked apple pancake is also a wonder of the world.  It's not the cheapest breakfast in town, and there might be a line to get in, but it general it moves fast, and if you order like I do your breakfast will keep you full all the way to dinner."}
{"text":"The baked Spinach Omelette with Gouda cheese was superb! All the ingredients were very fresh. The best that I have ever tasted. The service was great and we did not have to wait a long time to get in for a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"I had a delicious western omelet. Prices bring it down to 3 stars. Omelet, coffee and hash browns was over $16. I pay $8 for the same meal at my local diner."}
{"text":"Well chalk up another great breakfast at what I believe to be Charlotte's most excellent breakfast destination, The Original Pancake House (OPH) in SouthPark. Always packed, be it breakfast or lunch, OPH serves up consistently excellent food, all made fresh in house including its whipped cream, tropical syrup and crepes.  On this trip, I went with the strawberry Belgian waffle with fresh cream it's $7.95, with a side of bacon about $3. The berries were fresh, plentiful and sweet and the waffle, a perfect golden brown. Note that the bacon is thick-cut and crunchy, which I prefer, some may not. My wife order the chicken crepe which comes for potato pancakes which can be substituted with any other pancakes. At $8, this is not only a great deal but typically the portion so large that it leaves enough for lunch.  Service is always excellent and sanitation is consistently high. Predictably, the management is supreme as they always put the customer first and make it clear that they appreciate you as such. Nothing fancy here, just great food, service and prices make it a Gotta Try for me."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for breakfast/brunch.  The baked apple pancake, with the cinnamon and apple topping, is like eating dessert and is easily big enough for two to share.  The \"Grandparent Treat\" is also a good value.  Service is always excellent."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite breakfast spot in Vegas. They are affordable with large portions! The service is always great, food is wonderful, and they keep your coffee topped off! I would recommend everything on the menu, I have not yet had anything there that was not delicious and I've order quite a bit of different meals from their menu."}
{"text":"Wowza! Your dollar goes the extra mile here! The food was great, and the service was wonderful. What a nice place to stumble upon for a sit down brunch. If you don't leave here full, it's your own fault.  The omelettes are enormous! All in all, a good experience.  This is a cash only establishment, but they do provide an ATM for easy use."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the pancakes on this trip. Con beef was okay but had not crispy crust on it. The grits were alright but lacked butter.  The kids loved the chocolate chip panels but not the bacon. Had to much of a smiley taste to it.   Next time we will try the Dutch pancakes"}
{"text":"Phenomenal breakfast! Omelet was awesome and the waffle with fresh whipped cream, strawberries and their homemade strawberry syrup was the best I've had!!! Krista was the friendliest and most attentive server EVER! Will be back most definitely!"}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast or brunch. Recently I had breakfast with my husband and I had cherry crepes, bacon and coffee. My husband had the Santa Fe omlet with salsa.  We felt it was the best breakfast we have had in this town and the fresh squeezed orange juice was the cherry on top. Our server was Debi and she was very friendly, attentive and made us feel welcome."}
{"text":"They're known for their pancakes, so why would I get anything else? I ordered their Georgia Pecan Pancakes, which I thought would have pecans mixed into the batter. Nope. They're just regular pancakes with chopped pecans on top along with powdered sugar. The pancakes were light and fluffy, except for one of them which was overcooked and hard. Their orange juice is freshly squeezed and mighty tasty. With so many other breakfast places coming up with innovative breakfast items, I'm surprised The Original Pancake House doesn't do the same. Their menu seems more traditional, which is perfectly fine if that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"I visited this place in between deliveries to have a quick bite to eat.  Luckily I didn't have an order for quite some time because if I had I'd be in trouble.  When I arrived I was immediately greeted by the hostess and seated in a booth next to another party.  My first impression of the restaurant was overall warm and the place seems well-maintained with a decent health sanitation score.  They have a few random things on the wall for decoration but it's no biggie because you are here to eat right?  I will say that the food came out slowly but surely.  It was hot and fresh but they don't use any salt (which is good for a lot of people).  The atmosphere is good and service was okay but there was very few people there at the time I went.  I ordered  two eggs over medium, turkey bacon and substituted my pancakes for grits.  I didn't take time to really think much past taking a photo and I smashed the whole meal.  The pricing is a bit higher than what I would like and the whole experience just reminds me of an IHOP knockoff.  Maybe they came first but I really don't know.  What I do know is if you are looking to have a quick bite this would be a great place to try.  I mean what have you really got to lose?  For the area that you are in I would say this is a really good spot.  Of course you can grab something a bit more immaculate since this is located in Southpark Charlotte and there's a McDonalds right next door that does all day breakfast although those folded eggs aren't really my thing.  I can't really comment on this places Pancakes because I have never had them.  Another visit is due at a higher traffic time when it's packed to see what things are like then.  Until next time.."}
{"text":"Disappointed. At the start, they would not seat me with my two small children because my wife was a step behind. The restaurant was half empty! I asked them to just seat us in a table for three. He would not do it. After insisting, he called the manager over, who relented and let us get a table. On to the food.  The blueberry pancakes for the kids have no blueberries in them! What?!? There is blueberry syrup. The chocolate pancakes have no chocolate in them! Some chips are sprinkled on top. The French toast was just not good. Ok, maybe I should not have ordered French toast at a pancake house, but if you have it on the menu, do it right. Then when leaving, discovered it is cash only (hello tax scam). I got money from the ATM and paid for the $28.00 meal. While I am getting my son's coat on, he sets my change on the counter and goes over to talk with a customer. He gave me two singles and a ten. So, sadly, I only tipped the waitress $2, rather then fight again with the host to get more change. Just give me enough change to tip 20%; you saw the bill, you saw I got cash from the ATM. We will not be back and recommend you go elsewhere as well."}
{"text":"My two boys and I had breakfast at the Original Pancake House on a Saturday morning, because it's next door to the motel where we stayed.    The food was outstanding (as it is at most OPHs).  The crepe my one son ordered was HUGE - he was very glad he didn't order the three.  My other son had biscuits and gravy and said it was very good.  I had regular old bacon and eggs - and it was outstanding. The bacon was perfectly cooked - not too crispy, not too chewy.  The portions were generous but not overwhelming.  The service was a wee bit slow, but the restaurant was very busy that morning. Note that they only seat complete parties, so don't bother sending someone ahead to get a table."}
{"text":"My wife and I always go here every so often on a Sunday.  We went on September 27, and was informed that the we would have to wait 20 minutes to be seated.... But 6 minutes later we were seated. Had the Eggs & Thick Cut Bacon combo... Sub'd regular pancakes for blueberry pancakes and a side order of grits.   The applewood bacon is ADDICTIVELY delicious! Grits were plain. Eggs were ok. And blueberry pancakes great!  They do pack people in kind of tight at the tables.  You're sitting there elbows length of people near you. It's so close you can hear each other's conversation. Even thought it may take a little longer, for privacy and comfort, request a booth.  I like the fact that a good portion of the staff was there from the last time I was was there. Generally when see the same faces over a course of months to a year, that lets you know something positive about the establishment. Parking is also a issue with their small lot. It seems every time I go, there is this competitive and aggressive atmosphere to obtain a parking spot."}
{"text":"Doesn't get much better than this for breakfast.  I shared the asparagus omelette and sharing is the way to go, unless you haven't eaten for a few weeks. Bacon side, which was thick and juicy. Pancakes went down very well on our table. And service was excellent - stopping by to check on coffee every five minutes. Now I need to try and walk to the car..."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love this place? It seems like all of Champaign is here on the weekends! It's great. I've visited this chain in several cities and they are always consistent. I've never had a meal that I didn't love.   The dutch baby and apple pancake are a must-try!"}
{"text":"Still good food and service, but I just wish in the two years since I've been there they would've been wise to redecorate the place for a more \"homey\" feel. Everything's white! (Well, this is Madison, ba-dum-bump!). But seriously, get some gingham curtains like you used to have. Yes, some guys know what gingham is, get over it.   And don't go insulting the waiter asking for the Lumberjack's breakfast- they don't have it. And there isn't a need for it.  1/2 orderBanana pancakes, hashbrowns and coffee. Perfection."}
{"text":"Too expensive for the food quality. My omelette was awful and the pancakes were dry as ever! How is it that the thing they're supposed to make great (it's literally in their name), they made so bad? It's a pancake. Didn't know that could fail. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and it is definitely my favorite place to get breakfast in Champaign-Urbana.   Any of the pancakes are great, but I usually just stick to the buttermilk pancakes. There is a sweet buttery goodness to them that makes my mouth water just thinking about.   On the weekends the wait can be longer, but not unreasonable. It is definitely worth going to."}
{"text":"So, I love a good breakfast. Enough said. My husband and I took my brother, who is not normally impressed with breakfast to the Original Pancake House. He was really impressed.  It is a busy place, due to the great service and amazing food. So, be ready to wait. It is well worth the wait however. Everything from their fresh squeezed orange juice, to the Belgian waffles, to their sausage is wonderful.  It looks like a dinky hole in the wall place, and does not even have the same advertising as other Original Pancake houses around the country, but who cares because the food is exceptional.   Please do not pass up the opportunity for the breakfast of a lifetime. Yum!"}
{"text":"So I knew this place was going to be good when we came here on a Monday morning and it was packed.    After reading over the menu with what seems like a never ending selection of waffles, pancakes and crepes I went for the Kijafa Cherry crepes & Ethiopian coffee. The Ethiopian Coffee came in a french press, so you could probably get 2-3 cups out this one. The Kijafa Crepes came with 3 large crepes covered in cherries and this awesome sauce.  Each crepe itself could have been its own serving.   But I do have to remember that this is the South...so therefore everything comes in extra large.  I wish I was able eat all of it, but the my body will reject the greasy fatty goodness.  So the one crepe that I was able to eat was yum-tastic."}
{"text":"Overall, OPH is a solid place for breakfast. It can get packed in the mornings on weekends, but the line tends to move quickly. Service has always been fairly prompt and friendly.  Prices are reasonable, and their pancake selection is pretty impressive. Among that list are some definite winners and losers... Pumpkin pancakes were quite good. Understand that good pumpkin pancakes are *not* easy to make - pumpkin is very heavy and wet and likes to make your pancakes heavy. But they were good here. Light and fluffy, while retaining that awesome pumpkin pie flavor.  The apple cinnamon pancakes were much too heavy, and much too much. Not recommended.  The blueberry pancakes are respectable. As are the dollar pancakes.  Swedish pancakes are good, but my socks remained covering my toes.  The potato pancakes were not tasty at all, but maybe I'm just not a potato pancake person. Because I have good taste. Unlike the weirdos that get these.  The Georgia Pecan pancakes were also solid.  If you're in Chambanavoy and have wheels, this is probably the best place to get yourself some tasty pancakes."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I always get the Apple Pancake.  It takes 15+ min to cook, but so worth it.  I wish the side order of potatoes was a little larger, so yummy.  I always have leftover pancake and it tastes just as good when heated up."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast. The wait looked like it was going to be very long, but the restaurant is very efficient on moving people through. The pancakes were very good. Service was great."}
{"text":"Dry pancakes served with no butter and a strange concoction they call 'tropical syrup' which is corn syrup mixed with OJ.  Syrup served in a tiny ramekin. I ran out of syrup 1/2 way through and I dont even use much syrup. My friend's omelette was burned. Small portions. Overpriced. Booth had dirty seats. Nobody asks if you want more; they just bring the check.  You could do much better."}
{"text":"The food here is quite good.  They use fresh strawberries to make the strawberry syrup.  The food has always come out piping hot.  I usually get the Dutch baby with strawberries or the apple pancake.  These are both enough food to split.  This latest visit the service was barely above poor service.  The server was busy and our glasses frequently went dry.  The server did make some nice substitutions such as the fruit cup with no grapes or cantaloupe for a young child.  He also brought out alternate syrups upon request.  This place is very busy from the church crowd on weekends and parking is scarce.  Be prepared to lose your place in line if your entire party isn't there already."}
{"text":"Great breakfast the three times we have been here. Prices are reasonable and portions are large. Try and stay away on weekends because it tends to get crowded and you will have to wait."}
{"text":"My gf who lives in Vegas said that we had to try this place during out stay there because the breakfast is TDF! The OJ was freshly squeezed and $4 for a large glass which was kind of expensive, but I guess cuz its fresh.  I ordered the bacon waffle as requested by my friend to try. I was sort of sketchy about bacon in a waffle but she insisted it was delish. And was she right! I loved it! My bf ordered banana pancakes and they were huge! The only downside is that we thought the banana was mixed in the batter but all they do is cut up banana slices and place them on top. Boooo. We also shared an order was bacon and eggs. The bacon was thick, crispy, and yummy. It also came with a side of pancakes that we weren't aware of and omg, we had way too much food.  The place gets packed and the wait time for us was about 30 mins or so around 12pm. The total for the 4 of us was around $60. I guess that's how much you would spend at IHOP or where ever. I thought that was kind of expensive for breakfast. We might have just eaten at the breakfast buffets at one of the casinos.   Overall, the food and service was good. Wouldn't mind going back there again."}
{"text":"As someone who was a big fan of this place for years in California, I have to say that for many reasons, this would be the your worst choice for breakfast in Scottsdale. Our previous visits have always been filled with ridiculous waits for OK food and a very dirty table. This past weekend, we had the added bonus of a bitchy hostess/manager that actually mouthed off to one of our party and was completely rude and unreasonable. Please do not give your money to this establishment. (Besides, they only take cash...)"}
{"text":"Always get amazing food and remarkable service! Absolute favorite breakfast spot by far! Thank you"}
{"text":"I got the pancakes today, they tasted and smelled fishy it was funny the blueberry syrup smelled fishy too. As a side item i got the turkey bacon and it was awesome. Definitely not gonna order from this business again, I'm afraid."}
{"text":"Cook is not quite up to the chain standard   Its the little differences.   Sauce on eggs michael is less sauce and more jell.  Pecan pancakes are doughy.  Bacon arrives oily.   However, potato pancakes are excellent.  Eggs were cooked perfectly.  Coffee is very good.  Service is excellent.   Ill try them again sometime."}
{"text":"We have eaten there for years.  I always get the Dutch Baby.  This past Sunday morning we were seated immediately, order taken quickly and then it was a long 25 MINUTES until we got our order.  The order was lukewarm - we actually sent the side of eggs back because they were cold.  I then asked to speak to the manager.  He came out to our table, leaned on it with both hands (so he was kind of \"in my face\") and said \"yes\"?????   He was unfriendly and argumentative and all he would say is that baked items take longer.  I told him we had eaten there for years and it never takes close to 30 minutes and he never smiled, apologized, anything.  Wow!  Never seen customer service like this before at a restaurant!!!  For this reason alone I will not go back.  I guess his pride his worth more than his customers?  P.S.  I thought it noteworthy that several other reviewers complained about the same manager (one of them even described him to a \"T\").  Wonder why they keep him?"}
{"text":"Previously lived right down the street and never made it in here because although there seemed to be cars filling up the lot, I never saw a lot of people waiting outside. Now I realize that's because there's hardly ever a wait here because the inside is huge, the service is effecient and the staff does a great job ensuring everyone is seated quickly. This place is right around the corner from an Egg Works. It's not even an issue, hands down this place is better. Traditional pancakes are fluffy, potato pancakes have this great chewy texture and their baked omelettes are larger than life and bursting with cheese. Breakfast is one of those meals where you can skip eating out to save a few bucks and eat a little bit healthier at home, but if I'm feeling lazy at home, this is definitely one of my first choices."}
{"text":"Don't bother coming here with a large group. We came in at 10:20 on a Thursday and we had to wait over a half hour to be seated together. Our group was 10 people. They don't take reservations and refused to push tables together to accommodate. The management is useless and unable to effectively manage the restaurant. There were plenty of empty tables so the wait we withstood was unacceptable. If my out of town guests didn't insist on eating here, I would have left. I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"If I could give 3.5 stars, I would.   I've been here twice and I definitely like it. I'm not from here but went to college in Madison so we usually go out to breakfast here when I'm in town.  We went on a Sunday at 9:30 with a group of 18 and miraculously we were seated (we had a few people get there around 9:10 to warn them). This is extremely rare as far as I understand. Usually the wait time is long for even a group of 4. So that was impressive and the staff was very nice and accomdating, especially for a group of our size.  I've had the apple pancake in the past and it is YUM. It's huge and delicious and like nothing I've ever had before. The downside is that it takes a long time to be prepared. So this time I opted for the apple waffle (no extra preparation time). It was really good, nice amount of apple and cinnamon. It was a regular sized belgian waffle and didn't come with anything though. I definitely could have eaten more.  Many of my friends got combo platters which were definitely a better deal (like $8-9 for eggs, pancakes and meat). The pancakes were fluffy and light and there were a couple choices of syrups (regular, strawberry and maybe one other). The eggs were standard. My fiance loved the sausage. But no one stated that the combo was anything out of this world.  I was intrigued by their bacon pancake. Maybe I'll attempt that one next time.  I say if you want to go, go during an off peak time and try their super specialties like the apple dutch baby and apple pancake.   OH and one big thing: CASH ONLY. ATM is on site but I'm sure it charges a ton so be prepared."}
{"text":"This restaurant has really good food if you're looking for hometown flavor. Went here for breakfast before going to the outlets. It was packed and busy (always a good sign to me. I was seated within 5 minutes. The service was good and the food was better. I ordered the blueberry pancakes with eggs and turkey bacon. My boyfriend ordered the philly steak omelet which was R E A L L Y tasty. The omelette covered almost his entire plate. The waitress helped us out with a deal. His meal included a biscuit or 3 pancakes. I got his pancakes and added blueberries. But their prices will fit any budget with enough food for leftovers. Plan to return the next time I'm on Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Food is great.  Service was quick and friendly.  Try the cheese omelette with Gouda.  You will love it.  Refills fast."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It is always busy, so you have to be patient, but it is worth it.  You get huge helpings and friendly service.  This is a no fuss kind of place, but try it, you will be hooked!"}
{"text":"OR-PAN-HO; as it's called in my family has been a staple of my go to breakfast spots for some time now.  I think that when it comes to their Omelets and Pancakes they are tuff to beat.  The service from location to location isn't always consistent, but the food is.  I was very upset when they took the location out of GVR (Green Valley Ranch), but the other OR-PAN-HO's are still around."}
{"text":"Great food topped off by a horrible attitude combines for a rather unpleasant dining experience.  For whatever reason, this Oregon based franchise does not seem to apply its standards rules to the Scottsdale location which may be best described as stuck in the 60's with its horrible attitude toward customers, refusal to take any kind of plastic card, and even its refusal to serve Splenda (which costs more than other sugar substitutes).  Saving pennies at every corner may seem like a good idea for a business, but when it ends up disrespecting your customer base, not such a good idea.  The franchise needs to get this store in line or revoke its franchise rights."}
{"text":"Saturday morning and I had to stop in, it had been so long.  I had the strawberry pancakes (very fresh with the whipped cream of course), grits and country ham and the mrs had blueberry pancakes with bacon and eggs.  The food was great and the service was even better! Great Job OPH!!"}
{"text":"My wife has been talking about this place because she used to go all the time as a child.  The pancakes were good, but I didn't think they were anything special.  I would not be opposed to going back but I don't think I would  put it on my must go to list."}
{"text":"If you love breakfast this is definitely the place to go! The menu, at least during my visit at lunchtime, is entirely breakfast items with strong emphasis on pancakes and waffles.  I had an exceptionally good Denver omelet that came with a side of buttermilk pancakes. The pancakes were also exceptional. My wife had a meatlover's scramble that she thoroughly enjoyed. It too came with a side of pancakes. In both cases we could have opted for toast instead of pancakes, but what fun would that be?  Service was prompt and friendly even though the restaurant was extremely busy. The order was served up quickly too. Our waitress was very attentive and efficient. I couldn't have asked for better. Even though the restaurant was packed there was a roomy feeling to the dining room. It was a great experience all around.   We pass through Champaign about once per year. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The BEST breakfast place I have found in Las Vegas, next to Hash House A Go-Go.  Ordered the Spinach crepes and they were to DIE FOR.  Orange Juice tasted like it was fresh squeezed out of my mamma's garden!  My meal came with potato pancakes and they were excellent.  I definitely recommend and will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"While it's not as handy as the one that was on Charleston (that burned down), the food and service are consistently excellent.  I had the bacon lover's bacon and egg breakfast; it was fabulous, as usual."}
{"text":"I do not normally cuss, and will not start now. But, I declare this is the best damn breakfast spot this side of the Mississippi! I had the Swedish pancakes and lingonberries with a side of bacon.  The cakes were so buttery and warm and soft with a satin texture so real that for the first time in my life I wondered, if pancakes (like sheets) have a flour count. If they do, these cakes are 1000 Egyptian Cotton, baby!  And the lingonberries were summertime, a first kiss, a precious baby, a new car, birds singing, old men dreaming, and young people laughing. They were so fresh, so clean, so authentically berry delicious they'll make a hardened rapper pull up his pants. The bacon...oh, the bacon...succulent, divine, exquisite. As I ate my soul spinned on the floor Three Stooges style singing nyuk, nyuk, nyuk and woot, woot, woot, woot."}
{"text":"Finally made it to this place, good thing there was no rush.  The food was just avarage, nothing special here.  The problem was it seemed that only 3 or 4 people showed up for work on the day we chose to eat breakfast here.  We sat for over half an hour waiting for our food, I looked around & noticed that the whole place was just waiting, ridiculous!!  Our poor waitress was so stressed, she was shaking.  Our table was so full of redundant dishes & pitchers of duplicate things that the food wouldn't fit on the table!! Not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This cute little breakfast joint is a stone's throw away from my husband's work, so decided it would be the perfect spot to meet for brunch. We were immediately seated by a friendly waitress who gave us the low-down on the menu. I ordered the the buckwheat pancakes with Canadian bacon and scrambled eggs with an iced coffee. My husband ordered the Hawaiian pancakes. My coffee was served to me from a pot, most likely brewed at 6 AM, therefore tasted stale, and then poured over ice in a glass cup, served without a straw, which is absolutely the worst kind of way to drink it. My pancakes were tasty, but the eggs were lukewarm and tasteless and the Canadian bacon was as cold and dry as a honey baked ham left out all night and served the day after Thanksgiving. My husband enjoyed the first few bites of his pancakes, but couldn't finish them due to their extreme richness, and then later came down with a serious case of Montezuma's Revenge later that night. I'm not saying it was related, but it was related. We both agreed we will never be back."}
{"text":"Great food and service.   This is the place for breakfast in Scottsdale.   Hash browns rock."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times, but I have to say, I'm not super impressed. There is always a long line or some sort of wait for mediocre food. The staff seems extremely over worked and rushed, so I haven't gotten the best service.   The coffee is diner coffee and the bacon and sausage are over cooked. Their pancakes are good, but I prefer IHOP or Bob Evans. And for the love of god, do NOT get the potato pancakes. I was so excited they had these because I make them annually for Christmas, but they were awful.   Maybe a different location would be better, but for as much as this place is recommended, I have always been disappointed upon leaving."}
{"text":"This is a great classic breakfast diner experience. Any kind of a million pancake options along with crepes, French toast, everything plain or extravagant as you want it. I like that the side is often potato pancakes instead of hash browns- what a fun option! I came here because I had been brought up on Dutch Baby pancakes in Chicago and never see that on a menu. The staff is friendly in classic diner style.. My Dutch baby is right on the money!!! Exactly as I remember! Folks, if you try this, and you should, it's NOT A PANCAKE.. don't say it's too eggy or undercooked because it is a Dutch baby and how it's supposed to be. The middle becomes about a custard and the outer more cooked part is a beautiful light fluffy dough. I get it plain, it only needs maybe extra powdered sugar but nothing more. My son got a fajita crepe which was huge but, almost too huge.. There was so much stuff and filling you couldn't taste the crepe. What I do have \"beef\" with is coffee was $2.25????!!!!?? That seems ridiculous to me. So come, have a Dutch baby but just get water!"}
{"text":"Today is only my second visit to this place ever:  Pancakes, Sausage and Cubed&Grilled Potato with a little Onion!  Sorry for the comparison:  Compared to \"Eddie's Place\" and \"Le Peep\"!  Pancakes With Powdered Sugar Wrapped around Link Sausages and whipped Butter!  Yum!  These were Very Good!  4 yelp stars for the pancakes  Sausage Links 3 stars!  Good Flavor, better than Eddie's on the Sausage!  \"Le Peep\" wins on the Sausage  Cubed and Grilled Potatoes with Onion... 3 stars!  Eddies Place Wins on the Potatoes!  Service was Fantastic... Being sleep deprived made my ability to read a Menu even more pronounced, my Server told me how to get what i wanted as a package deal!  At 11:00 am Friday Breakfast they were Packed!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome...not sure why some negative posts...food and service was excellent...place was packed...unfortunately alot of Dodger fans...hahaha."}
{"text":"Very clean, great service from Shereen,  delicious food.  Corn beef is great, spicy chicken sausage is very good."}
{"text":"The baked omelettes are wonderful I eat omelettes all the time I have never had in the oven baked omelette I would definitely return and order a baked omelette they are a little far from my house but it was worth having a different breakfast experience not bad I will return"}
{"text":"I will definitely say this place is better than The Egg & I or Egg Works (can't stand their \"hasbrowns\" - they're just boring diced potatoes).   I really love their pancakes, whether they're plain, or banana, or whatever.  Always really fresh. I'm sorry to see other people had some bad experiences here, but so far, our food has always lived up to what I expect from a pancake/breakfast restaurant.  Although... I did finally cave and order the Swedish Pancakes (because I absolutely LOVE Swedish pancakes and lingonberries) - and I *was* disappointed that the ones at IHOP are better (I feel guilty for saying that).  The way they're made at IHOP is the way they should be made, and they're moist.  Here, they're served flat, unrolled and they were kinda dry.  That's where the 4 stars come in.  If they made those pancakes better, they'd get a 5 star from me.  Plus, the lingonberries weren't as good as the ones at IHOP (the Swedish pancakes are the ONLY reason I go to IHOP).    They do make DELICIOUS potatoes, just like my aunt used to make (again, I'm picky since I'm German and grew up with real, authentic German cooking).    We go there all the time, so, I really do enjoy their food.  Just bummed about the Swedish Pancakes."}
{"text":"Overall it's probably your best bet when it comes to pancakes / waffles in Champaign. The service is decent as well, but the wait can be a killer at times. I would suggest you not to go on Sundays since its packed and usually the quality of the food becomes mediocre, but other than that its a safe choice throughout the week. I usually get the Swedish pancakes and they are bomb."}
{"text":"really friendly staff, amazing food, and real good prices. You wont be  disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a tossup. Horrible and disrespectful service, but good food. The worst service I've ever had in any restaurant was at the Original Pancake House, and I explore food establishments on several continents. But I still go back once in a while for their crepes. Not letting me and my girl sit in a booth because we're only 2 people is also ridiculous. It's the end of the day and there's plenty of room. Being overly pedantic for no reason is not the way to treat people. Especially not when you're charging them $5 for a side of 2 strips of bacon. That being said, the service this time was still much better than previous experiences with them."}
{"text":"The first and last thing I noticed was how friendly the staff was here. The food comes out quick but then again I went when it wasn't too busy. The dutch babies are delicious and the menu overall is fairly affordable. The omelettes are also very generously portioned so one could easily feed two people. I would definitely come back again and again once I have a better income to support my constant eating out cravings."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast/brunch! Good food, good service and they get you in and out quick!"}
{"text":"Been 7 years since my five star review and a little over 20 years since I first visited this loacation.  Since that time I have been to several other OPH franchises to include back to the Original OPH in Portland.  Since my last review the Champaign location has expanded and remodeled.  Bigger is not better and outside of the pancakes everything else took a huge downfall in quality, taste and portion sizes.  Wife's omlette was runny (cloudy type)  and the home fries tasted like they were previously Frozen and were room temperature when it arrived.  The cornbeef hash was burnt.  When we left and we were asked how things were, I responded in a disappointed 'ok'.  Cashier did not seem to care.  Overall poor experience."}
{"text":"This is such a great place for breakfast/brunch! The pancakes are so good, but I love the omelettes the most! Crowded on weekends but worth the wait."}
{"text":"They make their pancakes with peanut oil.  Which makes me sad, because I'm allergic to peanuts.  So yeah, until they use something else, I literally can't eat pancakes here."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for over a decade. Great service, incredible pancakes & eggs & crepes & people & coffee. Definitely the best breakfast place in town. And I'm a bit of a breakfast snob. ;)"}
{"text":"I went here for a meet up with the family at 10:30 on a Saturday, the place was very busy but the staff was able to handle the customers and their orders quickly, accurately, and with a smile. This location was sunny and bright. There were booths or tables to chose from. The menu offered your usual selection of breakfast items and lunch items as well. I went for the tuna salad sandwich. Every one else at my table  ordered breakfast items which were cooked to order and seemed very tasty. I really appreciated the extra patience our waitress gave us."}
{"text":"Original Pancake House is my favorite breakfast chain. We have eaten at the one in Champaign twice. Yesterday, we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. Once seated, our server quickly took our drink orders and coffee appears right away. For breakfast, I ordered bacon and eggs with cheese. Pancakes or toast comes with that order and I got pancakes with bananas (you can get specialty pancakes for a small upcharge). My husband ordered the meat lovers scramble without cheese and pancakes. Our food came fairly quickly considering how busy they were. My husband's pancakes were not delivered with the rest of the food and it took 5-10 minutes to get them. Overall, the food was good. I ordered my eggs soft scrambled and they were still more cooked than I like. The bacon that Original Pancake House serves is the best bacon I have ever eaten! We'll eat here again if in Champaign at breakfast or brunch time -- I'll just have to remember not to go on the first day that kids are out of school!!"}
{"text":"Always good, but wait can be long in weekend mornings. Recommendations are: junior plate, potato pancakes, & western omelet. Omelets are huge but do reheat well for a 2nd meal."}
{"text":"I hopefully will be amending this review when I go back and try food that's more suited to my tastes.  I went here this past Saturday - the wait wasn't long at all and the host taking names was awesome.  Very nice.    We were looking forward to brunch as I had my bestie visiting from out of town.  We both ordered the Dutch Baby and split an order of potato pancakes and corned beef hash.  The Dutch Baby was just the wrong item for me to order.  I googled it and it was billed as a 'puffed pancake' when really it's more like a thick crepe.  I hate crepe's.  I'm not a fan of eggs frankly.  And this dish was just too eggy.  My bff enjoyed hers.  The potato pancake was also too eggy and not enough potato, though it was pleasantly seasoned.  The corned beef hash was good, but by that time I was just so let down by my poor choices that I didn't eat too much.  The service was great and I will definitely be back - it's funny everyone and their brother seems to know that a Dutch Baby is eggy.  LOL.  I commented to the waiter about it and he said \"yeah that's why i've never tried it, I don't like eggs.\"  So moral of the story - ask the right questions prior to ordering.  LOL."}
{"text":"9 dollars for a Plajn Belgian waffle, I don't think so, great service but food is overpriced. Better deal at cracked egg and better food. Also my waffle was burnt and crunchy. Not going back"}
{"text":"Maybe I'd give this place 2.5 stars if I could. Maybe. I have been to the Pancake House about three times and I have never been overly impressed.  I just don't get it when people give a breakfast restaurant five stars then say something like: \"OMG I loooovvveee the scrambled eggs and white toast, so good!!!!!\" The food is decent, but there really is nothing on the menu that wouldn't taste just as good or better if you spent 10 minutes making it at home."}
{"text":"Excellent pancakes of a large variety, great coffee, fresh meats and eggs, and a comfortable dining room.  The service is slower than molasses.  If you're going on a Sunday, prepare for the long haul.  Almost makes it a three-star, but the food is really delicious."}
{"text":"We went here for Breakfast after church one day.  it is a tiny place that looks old. But that is expected when it has been a favorite here for years and years.  So just be ready for a classic, small, diner style place.  It was pretty packed there so we ate at the bar. Service was good. Food was good. But nothing remarkable.  So honestly, I'd rather go somewhere that is nice and has a better ambience and environment along with good food."}
{"text":"I had the old fashioned buckwheat pancakes and home made hash brown potatoes. It was wonderful, definitely a friendly environment and good for families. It was refreshing to go to breakfast at an brunch hour without being surrounded by mimosas. I will definitely come back to this location."}
{"text":"Have a great brunch with my girls! I supposed the Dutch Baby would very slow but it came first and brilliant! And I like my farmer's scramble best! Pancakes also nice! One omelette with 3 buttermilk pancakes!"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I have been to OPH and I have only been to the one in Las Vegas. I loved that place and would go each time I visited Vegas. This was not the same. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Really great. Grew up with this chain in Michigan. The food is consistent and service is very good."}
{"text":"Good food at reasonable prices with truly exceptional service has been my experience over many visits.  The food is reliably tasty and well prepared- something that can't be said for Mickie's Dairy Bar, Ihop, or Denny's.   My coffee cup has never run dry, I've never finished a meal and found myself waiting around for the bill, and I have yet to order something that didn't arrive properly prepared.   Also of note- At least one of the negative reviews about this restaurant actually refers to the University Ave. location, which isn't as good.   My only complaint here is that the business is cash only."}
{"text":"We went here on Christmas morning and we couldn't have been happier.  The service was amazing and our waitress was so informative on the different menu choices.  I got the banana pancakes and my husband got \"the best omelet\" he's ever had.  They bake their omelets so they come out nice n fluffy.  Will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Used to love the Charleston location as a kid but noticed the quality going down over the past few years. I thought maybe they went through a change in owners but that wasn't the case. Pancakes aren't great anymore. A little too doughy. Service has always been bad at this location. Friends of mine also had an unfortunate run-in with the owner where she was so disrespectful that they left before they even got to eat. So not worth it when there are other great breakfast places around town like BabyStacks and the Egg and I."}
{"text":"Great pancakes, not a place to go if you're watching your cholesterol. Very rich and tasty. The wait, however, is a real drag. it seems like you have to wait FOREVER to get a seat. And even then, the service is slow. I also wish that they didn't discontinue the Hawaiian pancakes, they were some of my favs. I only stick to the pancakes, I wouldn't really go out of my way to try much else here."}
{"text":"Food = amazing. Servers and server assistance = amazing.  Hosts and Cashiers = not good. Since the process is to check out and pay the cashiers, they leave a lasting impression on our experience. And the hosts and cashiers were not very friendly. Quite actually ruined the experience.  But as far as food, amazing. Best potato pancakes and strawberry pancakes of life!gondo"}
{"text":"Underwhelming. My fiancee and I had a couple of friends in town, and they love OHP so we went. I had never been before and was anticipating a cross of IHOP and a cool brunch spot. Turned out to be an overhyped Waffle House in my opinion. We waited about 30 minutes to be seated, then ordered drinks. Our server, Jessica I believe, was great. She was very attentive and timely, always checking to make sure we were ok and didn't need anything.   I ordered a bacon egg and cheese sandwich with a side of hash browns. Not especially terrible, just extremely bland. The hash browns tasted like cardboard, so they were subsequently drowned in ketchup. The sandwich wasn't bad, but again the eggs lacked much flavor.   For the price I guess I can't complain too much, but I would rather spend an extra $5-$10 and have my socks blown off at a brunch spot somewhere."}
{"text":"Consider this a 2.5 star.  I wouldn't call this place bad.  They have a nice selection of breakfast options, good service and fair pricing.  But for a place called \"Original Pancake House\", the pancakes simply aren't that good.  Imagine my surprise :/    Now, I am not saying the food is bad... I am just saying... not that great.  And the flagship item, pancakes, were the main culprit.  Maybe it was an off day, but my pancakes were not the light, fluffy, buttery goodness, that I would've expected.  Instead, they smelled and tasted of straight up yeast.  I've never had that experience before.  Yeast in my bread?  Yaaaas! Yeasty pancakes?  Not so much.  Plus there was a curious lack of selection in the syrup/honey department.  I mean, it's a pancake house--shouldn't' there be some pouring options?!  Maybe i'll give them another try someday, but for today I remain disappointed."}
{"text":"There is better breakfast food in town if you prefer egg dishes over pancakes, but it would require a ton of nitpicking to give this place a lower rating, especially since I have been here close to 20 times. The servers here have always been attentive and friendly, and I love that they have coffee out for diners when there is a longer wait.  The omelletes are huge, so they're perfect for a bigger appetite. Some people prefer that it is oven-baked. I'm not one of those people, but I will order them when I am really hungry. I prefer the scrambles. You can't go wrong with any of those. While the egg dishes don't blow me away, they represent their name well when it comes to the pancakes. The buttermilk pancakes are some of the best I have eaten, and they have a huge selection of specialty pancakes.  You have to be here before 8am to beat the rush.  *Illinois athletics sometimes brings recruits here for breakfast."}
{"text":"After reading about half a dozen reviews on this place, I had to try it out for their pancakes (especially their apple pancake with caramelized glazing....YUM!)  So what did I end up ordering?...The fluffy spinach omelet...lol  and on the side I got three buttermilk pancakes (comes with the order).   I passed the place two times because the sign is covered with some hedge bushes and it doesn't look very prominent overall (something that actually impressed me!).  They don't have to flaunt their business name, they just let their cooking and service do the advertising!  Luv it! The omelet was perfect, the pancakes were pancakes for buttermilk....The service on point!   Next time, I need to come here with a buddy so that we can share more of the menu...One person is NOT enough!   So why did I give it four stars instead of five?....Well, so that I had something more to look foreword too!  Can't wait to get back here...  PS....Someone needs to take a digital pic of this place!....So obscure!"}
{"text":"First time experiencing The Original Pancake House. And it was not disappointing. This would be at least a 4.5 - 5 star rating if not for the price for the sausage patties, but that was pretty disappointing. ~$4.39 for two tiny little sausage patties??? Are you kidding me?  Other than that disappointment, yesterday's brunch was awesome. I got a 1/2 order ($2 off the original price of 8.49) of the bacon pancakes and wow were they excellent. I'd never tried anything like those pancakes and I'm gonna have to try that at home now and see if I can do anything even close to those. The lady had the Apple Waffle and she said it was amazing too. We split an order of the aforementioned sausages and an order of the country potatoes. They were both very good, but the sausages were not worth the money for damn sure. Excited to go back and try one of their egg specialties, omelets, or maybe one of the crepes. They have a great selection on the menu and the prices are very good for most of their items. The country breakfast atmosphere in the restaurant was very homey feeling and the service was excellent. It was a Thursday morning at about 10:30 and the place was not too busy so that was nice. Our food came out pretty quick considering what we got and that they make everything in house and from scratch.  Happy customer and the service was great. She was very attentive, and very friendly with a few common questions as we sat down that made us feel all warm and fuzzy.... 4 solid stars would be 5 stars if they added at least 2 more sausage patties for that price"}
{"text":"Disappointed! We come from Denver where the OPH is AMAZING and were excited to try this one, YUCK!  I read a review saying more for someone else- you can have it.  The food was slow to come out, service was rude, space is simply off putting, parking is a mess. Honestly, we wouldn't go back if someone paid us"}
{"text":"Good customer service, good menu, quality eating, so-so parking. This pretty much sums up my visit to OPH. Although I've been to other locations across the country, this one off of E. Camelback is no exception when it comes to quality.  If I had to change one thing, it would be within the parking lot. When you make the left turn off of E. Camelback (coming from Phoenix), you can almost miss this place due to its close proximity to the Motel 6. In fact, I'm certain that Motel 6 sold the OPH property it once owned. The table that I sat at faced the Motel 6's pool. Not a bad thing, yet this property can be easily missed from the road.   If I were OPH, I would place signage that clearly distinguishes this from the Motel 6. Altogether, a pretty good place to stop by to get some good eating!"}
{"text":"I was a lifelong die-hard IHOPer until my first breakfast at OPH.  That was 3 years ago -wheat germ pancakes and homemade corned beef hash- and it threw me into an existential crisis, forcing me to question everything I though I knew about a great pancake. Add to that, I'd never had corned beef hash made from scratch until that point. I was never the same.  OPH is a breakfast gamechanger.  One of my favorite things about OPH is that you can order more or less than the standard portion. I awoke wanting crepes AND pancakes for breakfast. Easy fix. Ordered 2 crepes, and 3 pancakes. *Slaying the red 'easy' button.*  Today was the first time I ordered crepes there, and had I known they make them so huge, would have just ordered one. They were more eggy than I would have liked, but the pecan pancakes were exceptional. Outstanding service by Rosalyn today. Lastly, I love maple syrup, so much so I could drink it. OPH is the rare restaurant that serves it in it's purest form.   You down with OPH?! Yeah, you know me :) ."}
{"text":"Awesome place to chow down on a delicious breakfast! Hit it up"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Lots of options, lots of different types of food. Pricier than say iHop, but well worth it. Excellent food quality and service. Clean and spacious. Filled with other diners, but didn't feel like I was crowded. They do have healthier options of that's what you are looking for."}
{"text":"OPH all over this country is amazing. I've enjoyed them in Minneapolis, Chicago, LA and Seattle.  I cannot believe how bad this location is and I hate that this is the only location in the valley of the sun.  Please... someone... open another franchise somewhere else in this valley.. PLEASE!"}
{"text":"When the hubs and I lived in Vegas this was one of our favorite places, and I was bummed to see some pretty negative reviews when we were looking for a place to have breakfast off the strip on our most recent trip out there. We actually scored a groupon so we figured we'd risk it and we were so glad they did. We have been spoiled by many an independent pancake restaurant here in San Diego - but we are still huge fans of original house of pancakes! We loved everything about breakfast - it was delicious, hot, and surprisingly didn't take that long to come out even though they were slammed. (Saturday morning at 10:30 - it's really annoying watching people complain about the wait. Don't be surprised!) I'm obsessed with their cheesy potatoes - yummmm. I had chocolate chip pancakes and my husband had an omelet and we split both. I'm also a fan of their coffee and my cup never once was missing fresh brew (and I'm a fast coffee drinker!) for the families - this is a great place to go. They had a balloon artist going to different tables, it was so cute. The groupon made a delicious breakfast a great value and we'll definitely come back next time were in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love The Original Pancake House and have been going since I was a kid. I moved to Arizona from Wisconsin almost two years ago and was ecstatic when I found out they had a location here. I live near South Mountain so I usually make a special trip to drive 25 minutes to get breakfast here. I looked at it's location on the map and saw it was in Scottsdale near Fashion Square so I had high expectations. This is where it gets funny...  The first time I drove there, I went past it atleast two or three times until I found it. There it was...in a dumpy parking lot attached to a Motel 6!! Yes, you read that right. I love the food so I gave it a shot. When I walked in, I immediately noticed how tiny it was, the old people/egg yolk smell, and the tacky signs everywhere that said to turn off your cell phones. If people can't sit on their phones, then people shouldn't be able to read the newspaper. Scottsdale has a lot of business oriented people that need their phones and it's extremely tacky to have that posted with neon papers everywhere.   I order my usual Dutch Baby with a side of whip cream, bacon and hash browns. The Dutch Baby takes 20 minutes to make but it is totally worth it. The whip cream makes the Dutch Baby even better and it's my favorite whip cream I've had since I've lived hear. I realize that sounds funny, but most breakfast places use the can stuff or even worse, the frosting stuff. Hash browns were definitely fresh but tasted like nothing. Bacon was perfectly crispy with no soggy spots just like I like it. I noticed a little hair on it which I thought was my dogs so I continued to eat it. I kept eating the bacon until I noticed that there was a lot of little fuzzies and realized that they actually patted down the bacon with crappy paper towels. Thanks for getting rid of the grease but how gross!  In other reviews, I see people talk about the rude waitstaff. I've had pretty good luck but I know who they're referring to. The first time I ate there we were sat 45 minutes before close and when it was maybe 5 minutes after close while other tables were still there, this old lady who worked their kept walking by saying they were closed conveniently \"talking to herself\" which made our group very uncomfortable. I tried to order grapefruit juice which they had at their other location but they didn't offer that. No sparkling water, so I stuck with my water and lemon. My guest orders soda every time and they bring it out IN A CAN... So my third time, I brought my own sparkling water in a can and we got sat at a table. Turns out we got the rude lady this time. She didn't greet us at all and walked right up to our table, picked up my can and said I can't bring that in there and it's \"illegal\" in a really rude tone again making my table feel uncomfortable. I understand not bringing other food in, but if it's a unopened canned drink when they serve only canned drinks?!?!   After my experience with the rude waitress that makes me uncomfortable even when I'm not at her table, and the horrible smell and location, I called to order take out. To my surprise, they don't do orders over the phone and you have to come in and order at the bar. The Dutch Baby states on the menu it takes atleast 20 minutes and the Apple Pancake takes 40. So I should show up and wait forever for take out? What's the point of even offering that service?  Depending on the business of the location, the hostess can be rude but the last time I was there it was very pleasant. I ended up buying a shirt from there just because I liked the shirt. The bussers are very quick and extremely attentive. Request Betty the waitress if she's there because she's easily the best waitress there! Find more people like her!!! Please consider refacing/remodeling or changing the location. I know you're relatively busy, but you could be busier and/or have more tables. If I happen to find another place in the valley that makes good Dutch Baby's, it's safe to say I will not come back. 5 stars on food -1 for the fuzzy bacon I get every time, -1 for scary old waitress, and -1 for horrifying crackhead location."}
{"text":"I have been to Original Pancake Houses in a few cities and it never fails to disappoint.   This location was great, with a wait on a Saturday morning (short around 930 am).  Our server was absolutely wonderful as well.  We had pancakes, eggs, bacon, and homefries between us.  The homefries were awesome.  In general, all of the pancakes are incredible, bacon is thick cut and delicious, and orange juice is fresh squeezed. Also worth trying crepes or the dutch baby if you're willing to wait for it.  Always an incredible experience, although not the cheapest."}
{"text":"Not easy to find this restaurant. Food was very good, service was steady, there were a few problems with the menu, no egg whites, no broccoli, no swiss cheese, and we were charged for items that we thought came with breakfast."}
{"text":"When it comes to a fantastic local breakfast here in the southwest part of Vegas, the original pancake house definitely is amongst one of the best places of choice for breakfast! There are plenty of places to sit as well as parking! Customer service is normally on point for the most part.. Wait times are exceptional as well! Facility has always been very clean on the times I've dined in! Prices for beverages are a bit high in my opinion so I stick to some coffee or water the omelets are by far some of the best I've had.. EVER!!! The Irish speciality is one of my favorites rather that's all I order with cheddar and Gouda cheese! Pancakes are always a hot nice and fluffy with a great choices of syrup! The cheesy potatoes are a great side choice of well even though it will cost you a little but extra!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside appearance scare you off.  I was a little worried about the outdated decor, and the fact it was connected to a Motel 6. But the food was great. The pancakes were delicious. All of the food was great. The only complaint I have was that there wasn't any fountain drinks. The soda was in a can, and you had to pay for each refill."}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast in town. Good, clean, simple err \"classic?\" breakfast food without pretension. Fresh orange juice & strawberries. It is a small, nationwide chain (around 75), although each one is managed pretty independently and the menu tailored.Also, as in anywhere the cleanliness of the kitchen & choice of ingredients matters, and this is why I think they do so much better than the others. Many of the standard items, though (like the apple pancake) is superb.  This is all fine, but the staff is really what makes it excel. Everyone treats you like family.  It's true that the weekend waits are long. You might take this as a sign. The early mornings and weekends are less crowded, but it doesn't have the same lively vibe."}
{"text":"Ohop has really good food. This is one of Champaign's sought after breakfast spots. The only thing that is a pain is they are always jam packed and when you have two kids waiting can be a pain.  The bacon is really good and pancakes are top notch. Biscuit and gravy are a must try. The price is pretty pricy, but the quality and portions are worth it. I recommend waiting put the lines or going during the week to try this gem!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, organized seating, what else could you possibly want? If they don't have it, you don't need it."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location. Was slightly unimpressed by the decor but I love the location. This location really does need an update. The waitress seemed to have a lot on her \"plate\". She came to my table twice...once to take my order and second to give check upon my request. My food was warm but it was good nonetheless. I don't know if refilling your coffee mug is customary but I would've liked to have been asked. I think I'll keep going to the location in South Park. The woman who seated me and took my payment was wonderful and very pleasant."}
{"text":"Don't get anything but pancakes.  They don't do eggs well, the bacon wasn't good.  Stick with pancakes.  That they do well!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Wait wasn't too bad either, about 10 mins to be seated."}
{"text":"This place is good if you want a big breakfast. We recommend the strawberry waffles. They are delicious."}
{"text":"Just finished a great breakfast here at The Original Pancake House. I had the Ham and Cheese (gouda) omelette. My mother has the \"pigs in blanket\" Very good. Service was above and beyond what we expected. Julie our server was very friendly and cracked some jokes here and there. Really enjoyed our 1st experience here. One thing the we will note, you have to get their pancakes!!!! The most fluffy pancakes we've ever had. The coffee refills were on point as well. Thank you so much Julie!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Grew up going to the one in my hometown, Columbia, SC.  I almost always get the crepes and they never disappoint.  Great service and I was pleasantly surprised to see they had the feature where you could get on the waiting list via Yelp."}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend with a friend, and we are from VA. We had searched a few places on Yelp for brunch, and every place had a 1-2 hour wait except Original Pancake House.... and I don't know why it didn't have a wait!  The service and food were amazing. All the workers were very friendly and helpful. My friend and I both had omelette and a small stack of pancakes, with the hash browns on the side. I had the southwestern? omelette made with egg whites, and it was the FLUFFIEST omelette I've ever had from a restaurant!!!! It was full of cheese and veggies, and the salsa on top was so flavorful, and the omelette was bigger than my head. I had banana walnut chocolate chip pancakes, and they were DELICIOUS! The hash browns were fresh potatoes with onions and seasoning, and they were perfectly cooked. My friend had blueberry pancakes and a vegetarian omelette that she loved as well.   We both paid around 15 dollars each at the end of our meal, which was a huge bargain for the enormous amount of food and coffee. I only wish I can find an Original Pancake house in Virginia now! It's basically a WAY better version of IHOP.   Also, don't forget to try the complimentary sauces and syrups they bring out with the pancakes, the lemon one is delicious!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Fashion Square, Old Scottsdale area. No AMEX but take other cards. Used to be cash only. Fluffy pancakes. Thick bacon, decent coffee, awesome omelets. Can have a wait at times. Food takes longer than you would expect to come out but definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Greeted and seated right away.  Took a good few minutes for server to come to table, even though only 4 tables in whole restaurant and other servers working.  Finally took drink and food order.  Asked him to describe the home style German potatoes, he said they are just like German potatoes! We both ordered meals with pancakes, however he delivered syrup and one small ramekin of butter, I said right away we would need another butter, he acknowledged me but never bought one, nor refilled coffee or checked on meals. Scrambled eggs were nice, bacon yummy but potatoes were barely warm and bland."}
{"text":"This breakfast place is amazing - I went to school at UIUC and every saturday, this was the spot to brunch. The butter and syrup they use on their pancakes is out of this world. The syrup has something salty in it, which makes the sweet/salty pancakes the best i've ever had. Don't go and NOT get pancakes :)"}
{"text":"If it's not yet obvious, breakfast is my favorite meal. Also my favorite meal to eat out. That being said, I love OHOP. They make these baked omelets that are incredible. Fluffy, cheesy and amazing. Pair that with a stack of yeasty buckwheat pancakes and I'm a happy boy.  I eat alone a lot (unless you consider a book dining company) and this location even has a booth for one. Good way to skip Sunday morning crowds when I head out solo.   Food arrived piping hot and looking delicious. Cup of coffee already in my belly. What more could I need?"}
{"text":"I have never been a fan of chain breakfast places (I'm looking at you, IHOP) because the chain business model ignores quality and just goes for churning through customers to maximize profits. The Original Pancake House is a chain, but completely unlike others- one that I actually enjoy.  When you come in, you are greeted nicely and sat quickly. We came on Easter Sunday and were sat right away (pretty impressive for the Bible Belt). Coffee was served right away (good luck getting that at IHOP) and our food came out only a short while after we ordered.  The taste was good, the prices were fair, and the service was excellent. I will return. Did I mention that I dislike IHOP? :)"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast joint. We really enjoyed the menu and of course the pancakes are tremendous. The meats are really good as well. We enjoyed their corn beef hash which is made fresh. I had the western omelette which was really good. I like the way they whip and fluff up the eggs.  The service was polite and efficient."}
{"text":"Amazing pancake house. Very traditional and lots of choices! I like the Dutch baby, it comes like a cake, yum yum!"}
{"text":"we went here on news year day at 2pm. The hours are very limited and they usually close at 2pm but where open until 3 for that day. Good thing because they used to always stay open until 3 and I would have been pissed we drove all that way. Food was excellent!!! They fresh squeeze all the juice so they were out of orange sadly. I got the eggs benedict and it was amazing. would have given 5 stars if they had the juice."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, cut from the same cloth as the Walker Bros establishments in the Chicagoland area.  Everything is heavily buttered and creamed here, so make sure to chase with multiples cups of coffee."}
{"text":"Retro back to the 60's with colors and booths to match.    Three large Swedish pancakes, sprinkled with powdered sugar and lingonberries. Pancakes are what one would expect but the small cup of berries only cover one pancake.  So either go dry or add a so, so syrup to the other two.  Syrup was not a good idea.  If you go solo don't expect a booth when it is crowded.  Tight quarters in the center tables and close to your \"new\" neighbors.  Average restaurant coffee (lots of it).  Service OK.  Cash only.  Has been and appears will always be cash only based on the history and age of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I was curious about checking this place out because they made Dutch babies and I had never tried one before it was so delicious and the pancakes and syrup we're the best I've ever tasted. The wait staff was fast and courteous oh and I almost forgot to mention how fluffy the eggs were in the omelets Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try someplace different than our typical weekend breakfast spots and I remembered Original Pancake House as it had been years since I had been there and my boyfriend had never been there. We arrived on Sunday morning about 9:45 and waited just a few minutes to be seated. Our server (Dianne) promptly came over and we got our waters and coffee. We looked at the menu and I was getting more and more hungry reading all the yummy options. As you walk in the front door they had their daily specials. We decided to both get a daily special. I had the Ham Steak, 2 Eggs, Hashbrowns and a Short Stack (Yes I was hungry - LOL) and my boyfriend got the Bread Pudding French Toast. Both were AMAZING! The service was great!!! I will be back to get the Dutch Pancake (takes 20 minutes and it's HUGE).   I also have to say that our server Dianne was AWESOME!!! Hope to have her wait on us in the future!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is great! The waitress was nice, great with kids, and our food was brought out pretty fast in spite of it being busy and we were a part of a large group.  Minus one star due to the omelette I ordered. The portion size was generous, but the omlette was too bland and somewhat unimaginative. Pancakes were AMAZING though. The hot chocolate is to die for. The options for a healthy kid's meal are extremely limited."}
{"text":"The wait at OPH is unbearable, but the atmosphere, once inside, is quite jolly and welcoming.  The portions are generous but within a few bites I have a stomach ache and/or heart burn.  The food is good, but I'd be just as happy anywhere else that serves breakfast food."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty, but accepts no cards, and usually has a long wait. I can't say it stands above other pancake/breakfast places around the city but it's certainly not bad and very cheap!"}
{"text":"I have been asking my husband to take me here for the last year and a half and we finally did when some relatives visited us from out of town! Our wait on a Saturday at noon was surprisingly only 25 minutes, considering there were a ton of folks waiting outside. Good thing it was worth the wait!  Our server(s) were fantastic - knowledgeable and didn't skip a beat refilling drinks. The eggs benedict I ordered were simple, but so delicious. The potato pancakes that came with it were so good - like comfort food to the max. I could've eaten it all day. My favorite (and last second addition!) was the coconut waffle. I pretty much died and went to brunch heaven that moment. Our cousin had the Dutch baby and he said it was just as good as it looked. The fruits on top were also sweet and fresh.  My husband ordered the apple pancakes - which was incredibly flavorful! It tasted even better the next day after heating it up in the oven. He raved about this place for a couple days, so I'm pretty sure we'll be back here soon!"}
{"text":"The hours today (Sunday) said they were open until 3pm. I arrived around 2:15 and parked out front of the entrance. Before I could even get out of my car, 3 waitresses came out and yelled at my girlfriend that they closed at 2. I clearly saw people that had just been seated. I would have been fine with them being closed at 2 (even though yelp said 3) if they hadn't been so rude in the way they told us. This will be my last time coming here and I'll be sure to pass my experience along to others."}
{"text":"You know a place must be special when you have people waiting outside (twenty, thirty minutes!) in the Charlotte heat just to eat breakfast. Once you enter, you realize it's not for the ambience, as the interior is unmemorable with dated food photos on the walls and tables packed into every inch of floorspace. But if you ask this girl, Original Pancake House, or \"O-HOP\" as my friends and I have always called it, is all about the food and is definitely worth the wait!  I feel like you can always tell the quality of a breakfast spot by the coffee. And O-HOP has great coffee! Smooth, strong but not bitter, always piping hot and fresh and brought out with the old-school little metal pitchers of real cream.  Both my boyfriend and I were feeling adventurous that day, and the risks paid off big time. He ordered the Apple Cinnamon Nut French Toast. Before long a heaping plate arrived with large pieces of French bread, coated in almonds, with gobs of REAL whipped cream and homemade apple nectar syrup. I would have been jealous, except I ordered the Apple Pancake at the suggestion of our waitress, and that pancake was the star of the show.  O-HOP's Apple Pancakes reportedly take an hour to make, but they have one cooking during brunch at all times because it's always being ordered so it is not an extra wait. Even if it were, again, it would be worth it! The Apple Pancake is a soft baked pillow of deliciousness, coated in thinly-sliced, sweet and tart Granny Smith apples that have been caramelized and glazed in cinnamon and sugar. I wish I had the words to better describe this extraordinary experience. This is a CAN'T MISS DISH!  All of O-HOP's items are cooked with clarified butter (ghee) and peanut oil. They use real preserves. Batters are made from scratch, and some mixes take days to develop. It's a true testament to the importance of details, because their food is truly divine. Don't let the ho-hum digs fool you, Original Pancake House  is a real diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in many years, mostly because they are always so very busy. Today I had corn beef hash and eggs. I must say I was disappointed. The Hash was very chunky with hard chewy pieces and because of that I'm not as disappointed with amount on the plate. My friend had a Ham and cheese omelette that looked incredible and she could only eat half and took the rest home. Mixed bag which is why they earned 3 stars, the avg."}
{"text":"Love the original pancake house, best service,great price point the food is to die for; five stars!"}
{"text":"I love the Original Pancake House!Their pancakes are AMAZING! I have had the buttermilk and the coconut type. The pancakes melt in your mouth and are best drenched in full-calorie maple syrup. They have some sort of Apple Pie Pancake that looks incredible- I plan on getting it the next time I go. I also have had the bacon and cheese omelet- which was huge! the omelet was super fluffy and full of thick cut bacon and cheddar cheese. I wish I could eat it everyday.  The only suggestion I would make to O.P.H. would be to let people pay with debit/credit cards. This is a cash-only business and they pretty much make customers use an ATM inside that charges 3 dollars per transaction if those customers didn't bring cash with them. It is a bit ridiculous since most everywhere takes card now. Regardless,I will be going back but stopping by Chase beforehand!"}
{"text":"yes, the giant apple pancake/actual cake, is ridiculously delicious. but the place is cash only and they wouldn't let us share...charged us for a seperate plate, even though we ate directly off the plate the pancake came on. i guess that's typical...i only noticed the service charge on the menu and many others, after that. unfair...."}
{"text":"You're either going to love this place or hate it.  There's no room for ambivalence at this eatery.  First, it's run by a couple of crotchety ladies.  They're pretty funny actually.  Secondly, our server barely spoke English and we had difficulty understand her and she us.  This is in Scottsdale mind you, right next door to the high end mall.  Thirdly, the decor is early 1980's with cheesy yellow tables and putty/white combo wooden chairs.   You're either going to be transported to Boogie Nights or think the place is skanky, as my Aunt thinks.  Be warned that the menu you see on the internet is NOT indicative of the actual menu.  I came here specifically for the sourdough pancakes advertised on the web and they were nowhere to be found.  I had the 49'er pancakes instead.  They were OK.  I believe they are the same as the wrappers they use for their crepes however, just be aware... under a different, gimmicky/cutesy name.  If you're a big pancake fan like I am you should know that they do indeed have real maple, but you'll need to pay for it.  About $2-3 extra and it comes in a little bottle.  Otherwise, you'll get the normal high-fructose corn syrup, caramel colored goop chains like this call maple syrup.  Would I come back?  Probably not.  It was kitschy fun the first time but since I'm a real pancake afficionado and there's 2 breakfast joints in town that have been featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives that make their own pancakes from scratch and have real maple sitting on the table, I'll probably leave the pancakes at the OPH to those staying at the Motel 6 next door -- where most of their clientele seems to come from.  p.s.  CASH ONLY, unless you're an AZ resident with your checkbook handy"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm spoiled. But The Original Pancake Houses in Minnesota were much better. I had the misfortune of parting with $15.90 for a sub par breakfast of Steak and eggs with home fries, coffee and pancakes. I ordered the steak medium it was medium well to well done depending on where you cut it. The home fries were tasteless. Not even ketchup could help them. At least the eggs were cooked correctly and the pancakes were the saving grace. The waiter had no personality and treated everyone like an inconvenience. I'm writing off this location and going to try the one in SouthPark."}
{"text":"Yeaaa, they are good...  Hubby and I make it a point to share whenever we come here.  There is absolutely no reason for him and I to be ordering our own meal unless we plan on packing half of it up. With breakfast, leftovers just never quite sound appetizing.   Portions for the omelettes are ridiculously huge! They are not the traditional type of omelette with the egg folded over the ingredients, instead it is more like an omelette pie!  They must use about 6 eggs for these beasts!  It looks like they most likely mix everything in the skillet and then bake it in the oven for a few.  It comes to you like a huge pie that you cut into and boom, there is the spinach and cheese and mushrooms oozing out onto your fork and knife as you cut.  YUMMMM is all I can say....    So hubby orders that beast, AND included is a 3-stack of pancakes with the order!  So all I order is some fresh strawberries and melon, and by melon I mean they bring out an entire half of a Cantaloupe with a spoon for digging! Man did we have quite the meal.  We shared everything and still walked out of that place FULL, and very very happy.    I definitely understand the long lines."}
{"text":"I like this place since they have a huge menu, but sometimes less is more LOL! You are sure to satisfy your hunger with their fair portions. This particular location has a very small waiting area/lobby and on weekends can get very cramped. That would be my only complaint. Serviice is usually good and there food is edible."}
{"text":"Okay I know they are called the Original Pancake House but they have by far the best french toast of any eating establishment I have ever visited.  But you gotta order the challah french toast, not the regular.  Pair it with a side of their awesome bacon and coffee and I am in breakfast heaven.  The only downside is this is the only OPH I have been to that has this on the menu.  Win for Las Vegas.  5 Stars!!"}
{"text":"This review is really late. This location has been burned down and hasn't begun construction again. But I will never come here and spend my money ever again. Rude service!! We had a party of four people but only two of us were present. The hostess sat us anyway probably because there was no wait. So our third person came shortly after and we come to find out that we were actually going to be a party of five instead. So we politely told our server that we were going to have more people join and she rudely replies \"Well did you guys tell the hostess that? You're going to have to move into another station and you guys are taking up my table.\" WOW. We are taking up her table????? I couldn't believe my ears. First off, not only did the hostess seat us at the table, which by the way we didn't insist on her seating us right away.. We would have completely understood if she told us to wait, BUT the host still sat us. Anyway, and to state the OBVIOUS, no one should ever tell a customer that. Ever.  I told her exactly that and I asked to speak to her manager. The manager was polite and told us she talked to her server and that she would make sure we would get another table with another server. So we sat in the front to wait. That's when we decided to leave and go to Jamms up the street where we know the service is always friendly and hospitable. Plus they have better food. I will never step foot in OPH now. Sorry. You lost our business."}
{"text":"Good food. And great service. Long waits but worth it not the most amazing breakfast I've ever had but definitely a good breakfast spot. They should stay open later"}
{"text":"There was a waiting line but we only had to wait for 15 minutes. The service is great here and the food is good too. I ordered and eggs Benedict which was good but the sauce wasn't a proper hollandaise sauce (tasted good regardless).   The highlight must have been the chocolate chip pancakes. Would definitely recommend this place for breakfast of lunch or if you're craving some good America style pancakes. We got 2 x eggs Benedict's and  1 x half a portion chocolate chip pancakes and paid about USD 33,- for us both."}
{"text":"The customer service here is a joke. Not only did the waitress gives smart ass responses so did the manager! Unbelievable the manager told my fiancé to \"go eat tomatoes\" since he didn't like the pancakes and was asking to get the substitute. Short, rude, and doesn't understand the basics of customer service. No need for a smart ass comment! Never coming here again, and the food wasn't all that either. Might as well go to IHOP. Least no one is going to tell my fiancé to eat tomatoes there."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars only because they pull of their namesake really well. Really well. Good variety too so you'll not get bored of just doing the pancakes here!  Trouble is, I can't just do either sweet or savory. And I'm not a fan of their savory options. I never enjoy their potatoes, their eggs are okay, and the one version of their sausages I loved was the pig-in-a-blanket with a dollop of syrup and butter."}
{"text":"The apple waffles were to die for. Not to mention the red syrup made it even more exquisite. The coffee and potatoes weren't too shabby either. Well worth the money."}
{"text":"This one of my favorite breakfast spots in CLT. The bacon is delicious, the French toast and the breakfast potatoes are great!!! If you go on the weekend be ready for a long wait."}
{"text":"Almost ten years later so I figure it's a good time to update my review. Well as you can tell by my second five star rating of OPH, I am still a very happy customer.  I will say that the fact that they have included themselves as part of the Nowait app has made my visits here that much better. While en route (as a passenger, thankyouverymuch), I check the wait times at OPH and then depending on time left of drive, I will add myself and party to the wait list. Each time I've done this, I've been able to walk right in and be seated. GAME CHANGER.  My normal order is the junior plate which comes with one egg (scrambled), two turkey sausage links, and three pancakes. I clean my plate every time. no shame. I try to talk myself into trying something new every time I go but I like what I like!  I must shout out their DELICIOUS home fries. Potatoes well seasoned and cooked with diced onions as well as their insanely thick-cut bacon. Seriously, they have the best bacon slices to be found. Also, they serve coffee piping hot. The way it should always be.  Everyone here from the hostess, to the waitstaff, and check out person have all been friendly in my experience."}
{"text":"The service is pretty good but you have to wait a bit of time for your food. I highly recommend the apple pancake, it really isn't a pancake it is like a pie. Get here early so that you avoid the crowd."}
{"text":"The wife and I visited this establishment this past Sunday to compare it to the one we used to go to in Forest Park Illinois. I had read here on yelp about the long lines and indeed we ran into that when we arrived about noon on Sunday. There was a 20 minute wait and i was shocked to see this place so busy do to the fact that it is right next to a Motel 6. I say that because with the obvious patrons from the Motel i would think people would not come because they would have to \"battle\" with the Motel crowd.  When we were seated we got a very nice waitress, we already knew what we wanted so we ordered. I had the smoked turkey sausage with 2 eggs, 3 buttermilk pancakes, and hasbrowns. My wife had Pancakes with 2 eggs with chorizo sausage and hashbrowns. The FOOD is definitely the reason for the long lines people...trust me we were not disappointed at all with that. The service was outstanding as well and while it is a little more expensive than in Illinois the FOOD more than made up for it.  A personal note here: i was a huge fan of The skillets this establishment  made back in Illinois which consisted of potatoes,  3 eggs, your choice of 4 kinds of meat , cheese  and,  veggies. This was definitely the best deal in the house for the money, but this pancake house did not have it on their menu. You can order all of these things however,  a la carte but it will cost you, but trust me all mixed together it is quite delicious.  Now i don't know if i will go again on a weekend day, due to the lines but i will have to visit during the week to see how it looks then. Also bring CASH because unlike the location in Illinois they don't take plastic here. So i will keep you posted my friends as i plan to visit them this coming Monday, until then Eat, Drink and  Be Merry!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food comes in big plates. Sucks I couldn't substitute my food pancake for French toast , long line went by quick . Seems bigger from the outside. Tip if you want to save money and still get eggs and ham or bacon in your meal with pancakes ,  look at the Egg Specialist section . Affordable and for the quality it's worth getting . I will come again . My server was great but kinda annoying constantly asking us if we're ok every 2 mins .... I can't say yes with my mouth full that's all I'm saying ."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of places so maybe I expected a little more. For a diner style restaurant (meaning not hoity toity) it wasn't very friendly and warm. We were seated quickly on a Sunday morning so that's convenient. I was freezing and asked if our party could sit in the back booth. A lady who may be the manager said she would turn off the fans but wouldn't let us move. \"The air will blow on you anywhere\" she said. Was the booth reserved? Was the queen coming in for breakfast? No one ever sat in that booth. I also want to mention that we asked for a booth when we first came in. The food took forever to come out. It took about 25-30 minutes. Mind you I ordered one scramble egg and turkey bacon. Everyone else ordered regular pancakes. If their Dutch baby takes 20 minutes why would our very simple orders take so long? I didn't order much but the food was ok. I left my table a little early to wait outside because I was so cold. None of us received a goodbye. I personally wouldn't return."}
{"text":"We recently found this amazing restaurant during a trip to Charlotte and must say, it's the best pancake house EVER!  We've had to come back to Charlotte the last few weekends and always make sure we end our trip right here!"}
{"text":"It had been a couple of years since we visited, and the service (and cleanliness) seems to have gone downhill.   We got there around 8:00 a.m. on a Sunday, and it wasn't crowded at all... however, it took so long for our waiter to come by that we were about to get up and leave. He finally showed up, and I ordered the banana walnut pancakes with bacon while the fella ordered sausage and eggs over-well.  To be fair, it IS called the Original Pancake House, so sausage and eggs probably aren't the way to go, but the fella got the driest-looking hockey puck sausages I've ever seen. His plate was just sad. My pancakes were good, but they just had a few slices of bananas and walnuts on top - it seemed odd considering most banana pancakes I've had had the bananas already in the batter. The bacon was solid.  As we left, the place was pretty packed, so maybe the service gets better as they get busier? I won't be in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey compare to other restaurants. The pancakes were amazing though. No doubt about that.   We had Santa Fe omelette and asked for our sauce on the side but they just plopped it on top instead. It was mediocre.  Our service wasn't that great either.  Our server came over to our table three times the entire time."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast.  I had a german pancake and my wife had an egg dish with hash browns (subbed for pancakes).  The german pancake was good.  I had the basic one served with butter, powdered sugar and lemon wedges.  It did have some burnt/crispy edges I removed before eating it.  Not sure if that's normal here but it doesn't look the best.  I would order the german pancake again but at full price, it is pretty expensive, almost $10 for one pancake.  We had a good coupon that made our meal a good value.  I would come back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so at full price."}
{"text":"Coffee was DELICIOUS!!  Pancakes were small and they we weren't fans of the strip. Omlets were big but not very flavorful.  Service was great but I really wish they'd write down what you order because our waitress (who was really sweet) messed up our order twice. I asked for skim milk and she brought whole and my hubby ordered OJ but she brought him coffee. Overall pretty good though."}
{"text":"Pretty much solid everytime I have come here. I love pancakes and this has an incredible amount of variety. Very fast even on busy days, they still don't seem to be backed up"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place on university. I love it and have been going here sense I was a kid. Great service, usually pretty fast. Sometimes the wait can be long but I don't complain about it because they have such great food! This is the only place that I can get great hash browns and delicious pancakes."}
{"text":"Let me pre ent this review by stating that breakfast is our meal we eat out most often, that said the service, food and coffee at Original Pancake House was out of this world.   We were seated in a bright section of the restaurant, were asked right away for out beverage choices and were given menus. We were greeted by Marisa, and she asked if we had any questions. We ordered two coffees and told her we took cream. We were immediately brought 2 big cups of coffee and a good sized pitcher of cream. The coffee was hot and tasted delicious, it was of high quality and prepared perfectly, in fact were the several refills we received.   We ordered our breakfast, my wife ordered bacon and scrambled eggs and upgraded for $1 to potato pancakes, I ordered the meat lovers omelette with pancakes, I upgraded to banana pancakes. Let me start off by saying that my wife did not share her bacon with me, normally she does but she preempted it by saying that it was the absolute best bacon she has ever had ever! And that she didn't want to share but she was not going to. She was also served three piping hot perfectly cooked potato pancakes, mind you these only cost a dollar extra and she is a lover of potato pancakes and she said that they were awesome, even the scrambled egg she had where light and fluffy and delicious the potato pancakes were served with sour cream and applesauce.  The meat lovers omelette was just that it was crammed full of perfectly cooked in lean him perfectly cooked bacon and sausage it also had cheddar cheese the omelette was huge almost as big as the plate very sick and high and also fluffy I have yet to have a better omelette!! The omelette was probably the best I had but to be completely honest the star of the show with the banana pancakes not only do they have an entire banana cut up and placed on top that was perfect in all regards but the pancake batter itself had the taste of bananas not the nasty artificial taste as someone have but a very natural taste of bananas with a slight hint of brown sugar. Combined with the high-quality pancake syrup they supplied it was quite amazing it was served with a dollop of fresh grade AA butter whipped, and that brought the flavor profile to a new level.  All in all it was excellent service by our waitress Marisa, and the other folks who constantly refilled their coffee and asked us if we needed anything else.  If you're in the area and are craving a delicious breakfast of the highest quality in one great service and delicious hot coffee this is the place to go if we didn't live two hours away this would be our go to breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I've been to 4 different Original Pancake House locations.  The other 3 are all an absolute treat.  This location sucks.  The food is OK.  The manager is a dishonest dealer.  He charged me for things I did not order and refused to take them off the bill.  The services was unfriendly to say the least."}
{"text":"The best breakfast!  Good people, excellent food, no matter what you order.  (Terrific hot chocolate, too.)  Simple diner, the owner is a real philanthropist (gives generously to animal causes, for example) and a decent fellow.  Highly recommended!! And I LOVE the 'No cell phones' sign! Wish more restaurants had them! Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Confession: If I'm not feeling Vietnamese Pho, this is my other top pick for a hangover breakfast stop. Their hash browns alone are enough to get me in the door. It's also just a really great spot to come and eat. They have a huge menu and they do everything well. I love getting the Chorizo omelette with egg whites and gluten free pancakes (yep, I'm *that* person at the table -- and they never seem to mind my finicky ordering!) My husband loves the Grilled Chicken and Spinach omelette.   The coffee is good, the service is impeccable. They move a TON of people in and out of this place every morning. And the omelettes are HUGE. It is seriously difficult to leave this place hungry.   As an example of the impeccable service, last time we were there my omelette accidentally got made with regular eggs instead of egg whites. Our server recognized it before serving to us and offered me free hash browns to nibble on while I waited for them to remake my omelette (which only took a few minutes.) It was a really nice touch."}
{"text":"We have driven past this place many times, but never stopped because we have our \"favorite\" breakfast places, but we've always said we'd need to try it at some point. Well, today we did, and I'm not disappointed! Hubby had the ham steak and eggs, which come with 3 buttermilk pancakes, and he ordered a side of German hash browns. Ham steak was smoky and not-too-salty...very flavorful. The pancakes were good, basic pancakes. Eggs were cooked to perfection and he really enjoyed the potatoes. I had the Venecia Benedict and I LOVED it. It comes with four potato pancakes, which were tasty, but a bit on the greasy side. That is literally the only negative to the meal. If they had been less greasy, I'd have given five stars. Our server, Kate, was attentive and kind. We were served quickly and it was a great experience overall. We will come back."}
{"text":"Came here for some breakfast on a Wednesday morning. Wasn't too packed, so service was quick and friendly. I pretty much found this place to be a bit better than what you find at places like IHOP and Denny's. But I'm bumping it up to 4 stars just because they were so kind and patient with our big party of 9. And the pancakes were very fluffy and delicious haha."}
{"text":"Regardless of how the food tastes, the service is horrible. And when asked about changing specialty items, even for something cheaper, due to allergies they will not do so. Any business should want to customer happy and to return. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by friends and I can see why. We knew this place had to be good when there was barely a place to park to get inside. Once inside there was a wait, for BREAKFAST! Really? The staff was very nice and the wait was reasonable. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. I got the short stack blueberry pancakes and they were absolutely fantastic. My wife got short stack of buttermilk pancakes. She raved about them. The entire staff was hospitable and hustled to take care of everyone. I would like to see some sides served with the pancakes, but all of those were extra. I guess you can't have it all. I will definitely eat at any of the Original Pancake House' I see. This would be a great place to fill up on some great carbs before a long day of hiking or biking. Loved it."}
{"text":"If you go on a weekend make sure you plan on waiting in line for a while - but it's worth it! The food here is outstanding. I especially love their biscuits and gravy and eggs Benedict. Service is always fast once you are seated and servers are usually very nice."}
{"text":"Been coming to the original pancake house for years, massive omelettes and good food all around. Service is sometimes hit and miss but today we had Brian who was awesome. Keep up the good work and we'll be back"}
{"text":"Best homestyle pancakes in Madison without a doubt. Gets crowded fast on weekend mornings."}
{"text":"OMG. This place is heaven. My friend- who is a local, had planned to take me here for breakfast before dropping me at the airport. Now- I had been entertaining clients the night prior and may or may not have had too many martinis. So I may or may not have been seriously hungover. Which could explain why I took a picture of my coffee-cup (see pictures). The coffee was quite a welcome taste. NOT \"bad diner coffee\". I ordered Eggs Benedict and (yes AND) plain buttermilk pancakes. OMG. Everything was perfection. The food is a thrill- soooo delicious. My friend said they don't have hashbrowns- as you can see in the picture, you get potato pancakes. Yummy. I did NOT even peruse the menu- but I could see they have TONS of pancakes, omelets, and pretty much every breakfast concoction you can imagine. Honestly- I'll be here EVERY TIME I am in Vegas- for a cheat day of course. (Yea, I'm one of those fitness freaks that watches what I eat 80% of the time, so this is a cheat meal in a big way.) So worth it."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of all kinds of pancakes and Original Pancake House fills that need in my life. I had the blueberry pancakes just this morning. The veggie omelet is also really good, and OPH has all the breakfast options you could ever want.   They moved from their South Boulevard spot to the new Charlottetowne location in the past year. But the problem was the same with both locations: parking is awful. There just isn't enough parking for how packed the place gets, and the lot is always a mess of confused drivers.  If you go on a weekend morning, expect to wait a long time for a table. If you go on a weekday morning, expect to find lots of moms with sticky little kids."}
{"text":"I got the strawberry French toast and it was great. We had Cedric as our waiter and he was quick and very polite."}
{"text":"The pancakes are amazing. And the omelettes are probably the fluffiest I have ever seen. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"I'm still going strong on my not eating out challenge...but when my sister wants to take us out to breakfast...who am I to say no? Original Pancake House (or OPH) has become a regular Sunday breakfast spot when my mom and sister are in town. We meet up, chit chat...with my monkeys getting into the sugar caddies (no worries...I clean them up and put them back in order for the server...its really annoying when parents don't clean up after their offspring...servers aren't your slaves...ok i'm getting off my soap box now).   We were greeted by Monica (who has graciously waited on us before). She was sweet, quick as lightning, and very knowledgeable about the menu (my sister asked her 1,000,001 questions about the chocolate crepe). She brought the monkeys drinks in kid friendly cups without being asked and did her best to clear everything away from their reach.   The coffee is good, the grapefruit juice was fresh squeezed, the whipped cream wasn't out of a can, the pancakes were fluffy, the portions were huge and it made us all very happy. Will most likely be back on Sunday."}
{"text":"The apple pancakes were piping hot and full of apple, cinnamon and real maple syrup. This place has a cool early morning vibe: mixture of old folks, families and business people getting ready for the day and enjoying the company and the food.   Service could be faster, but the place was slammed."}
{"text":"i fucking love this place omgggg everything was out of this worlddd bigg portions for cheap !!! and everything was fresh!!"}
{"text":"Crepes... glorious crepes!    I've frequented OPH for many, many years!  The quality, service and the decor (unfortunately) never changes.    Things to know:  They do not accept credit cards They do not take reservations They will only seat you when your entire party is there The wait on the weekends is almost unbearable The French Crepes are freaking amazing! The Apple Pancake is delicious, slow and a modern miracle of baking Dessert for breakfast? Chocolate Chip pancakes!"}
{"text":"My apple pancake was delicious!!  Waiter told me it might take a while because it's baked, but it came out pretty quickly. Service was good.  The bacon here is just bacon though, so all the great reviews on it are highly exaggerated."}
{"text":"Very good first impression. We waited only 7 minutes on Sunday morning at 10 am. I got the eggs benedict and my dad got the chorizo eggs benedict. Mine was 3 stars, good, but I've had better. My dad gives his 5 stars, great sauce, spicy chorizo and nice flavor overall. Coffee was good, service was nice, and the food came out quick. We would come back and recommend."}
{"text":"I love the diversity of pancakes this place offers. The icing on the cake (errr....pancake) is that they actually taste really good!  Prices are decent and comparable to IHOP.   Worth checking out if you're in the area....."}
{"text":"Have visited this location numerous times. The food is excellent and the service is alright. I usually order my eggs over medium and this last visit they weren't even sunny side up. Obviously an error on the kitchen's part but should have been caught by the server. I brought it to the attention of the manager and he apologized and didn't charge me for my meal. I little hiccup, but was handled professionally. Will definitely return. Great food and big portions."}
{"text":"It's very small inside, the atmosphere is rather boring and bland. I ordered one waffle and coffee. Asked the server if it was \"Belgian\" or \"regular\" waffle, she had no idea. It was \"regular\" waffle and not Belgian which was GREAT! Anyways, the coffee was sub-par and the waffle was stone cold. When I paid at register, she asked how was everything I said Waffle stone cold, \"really' I saw them take it right up. Whatever that meant, an EXCUSE not an apology. She didn't charge me for coffee. I would not return, I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Writing this in the car because I'm so mad. What a joke! Came here and ordered a mushroom, cheese and ham omelette. First one they brought had all the cheese at one end of the omelette with about 80% of the omelette having no cheese. She agreed and took it back to be remade, next one came out with huge chunks of unmelted cheese everywhere!! Told her thanks but I'm just going to take off as it had been about 40 minutes of my time wasted. She then proceeds to bring me a check for my iced tea!! Unreal!! I asked for the manager and she said \"you're good don't worry about it\"."}
{"text":"Edited: Man, I don't know what's wrong with you people that don't think this is the greatest breakfast place, ever! There are a few mediocre exceptions. I'd avoid the belgian waffles and the french toast. But the omelets, the pancakes....yum!!!  Sweet? Savory? No matter what you're looking for, it's here and it's done to perfection. The omelettes will be a bit of a wait because they are baked, but they are some of the best you will find.  Their pancakes are also the best I've ever had. I don't know what makes them so perfect. Best breakfast in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had the most delicious fresh strawberry banana Belgium waffle with fresh whipped cream and strawberry syrup! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I have made my last trip to this place.  A more fitting name would be The Original House of Rules...I ordered scrambled eggs and sausage...asked what it came with...they said potatoes or toast...I asked if I could substitute fruit for the starch (something I never get resistance on anywhere else)...no...so I opt for rye toast...they say whole wheat...I guess that will have to do...and ordered the small portion of fruit on the side for $3.75...bananas and strawberries...what, no melon - its definitely in season?  No melon...strawberries and bananas.  No cell phones (which doesn't bother me - I always leave my phone in the car when I dine)...no credit or debit cards...just cash...no gift cards...just cash.  And if you didn't know about that rule and don't have enough, you can step up to the Original ATM Machine and pay $2.50 to get the cash to pay the bill.  Maybe its just me, but I'm used to establishments being a little more customer friendly and flexible.   The food was just okay.  Not even close to good enough to justify all the rules and inflexibility."}
{"text":"This is an excellent breakfast place!  Nice pancake selection!  They give you a lot of food.  I had the Hawaiian pancakes with tropical syrup.  While my family and I ate our meal, several employees used the nearby kitchen sink to wash their hands (good to see). The service was good and quick.  If I lived in Vegas, this would be one of my favorite, regular places to eat breakfast.  It reminds me of the way IHOP used to be."}
{"text":"Nothing like a little BFL (breakfast for lunch).   The menu has an overwhelming amount of options, including pancakes, omelettes, scramblers, meat and eggs, crepes; you name it. My corned beef hash was better than expected! It was crispy and flavorful, though not as meaty as I'd like. If you're at a pancake house, you'd better choose a side of pancakes over toast! Fluffy, buttery batter awaits your taste buds!  Service was friendly. Next time I'm trying the pigs in a blanket! Looked like the perfect combo of sweet and savory together."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I took a Thursday off work and decided to check the Original Pancake House out for the first time. We arrived at 9am and the lot was PACKED! The restaurant was also completely full. Luckily, we walked in as a couple was walking out so we got a table right away. Our waitress was very friendly and we got our drink order taken right away.  I ordered the strawberry pancakes, my fiancé ordered the chocolate chip pancakes, and we split a half order of the biscuits and gravy. My strawberry pancakes were to die for. A TON of fresh strawberries topped with whipped cream and served with the most delicious strawberry syrup I've ever had over six pancakes. I loved them! You definitely get your money's worth here! My fiancé' pancakes were a bit too sweet - chocolate chip pancakes with chocolate syrup and whipped cream. I'm sure this would have been a child's dream breakfast ;) He'll probably go for something a bit more savory next time. As for our biscuits and gravy, they were way too salt and pepper-y. We didn't eat very much of them and they were kind of expensive ($6).   All said and done, I recommend that you do not come here for the biscuits and gravy - come here for the pancakes! (Especially the strawberry pancakes.) They are the *best* in town and will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Get the chorizo omelette...you're welcome. If you have a taste for something sweet then make sure you get the French crepes with powered sugar. The pancakes were small yet fluffy and extremely filling. So disappointed that my turkey bacon came out burnt but oh well. The service was lacking. I'll try to come at a less busy time and see if that improves my next experience. Checking in through yelp shortened my wait time."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome the omelettes are amazing. We had the mushroom omelette the  sherry sauce was excellent. The pancakes are so delicious as are the crepes. The hash browns are seasoned well and cooked to perfection. Jesse  is a fantastic server and made our breakfast enjoyable."}
{"text":"I adore a fantastic breakfast. Reasonably priced. Excellent service. Service is ALWAYS great! Most friendliest and attentive serving staff on the planet. It's got a very Comforting feeling. The place is rocking hard by 8am so get in early. That's when I prefer to go. When the crowd is full of the wise and life seasoned. I love the old people. The vibe is safe. Comforting. The pancakes are out of this world. I love the pigs n blankets. The ham and eggs are fab. Omelets and potato pancakes are super good. But a secret weapon in the kitchen is the freshly squeezed juices. I love to come with a great conversationist or by myself early before 8. Sip on coffee and read a book. While I dine on a fab breakfast. This is what I love about the weekends."}
{"text":"Jeepers Batman! This place is amazing! The staff and kitchen are right on target! I ordered the Bacon Omelet and it was a huge portion defintely couldnt finish it all! My mom LOVES LOVES LOVES the strawberry crepes with fresh whipcreme! This place is definetly 3 steps up from Dennys and IHOP!!! If ever you want a great breakfast check this place out for sure you wont be dissapointed!!!"}
{"text":"Realllly, no take out !? If I wanted to come in and order to go at the bar and wait for it, I might as well just sit down and eat. It would also be nice if they had gluten free options for people that are allergic."}
{"text":"Yummy food but beware, the portions are HUGE! Expect your omelet to take up the entire gigantic plate. Not that it is not delicious, just might be something you want to share verses going solo.  I'm taking off one star because although we both enjoyed it (the food was good, the staff friendly, and the service great) my boyfriend got really bad food poisoning. Could have been a fluke (he had the regular omelet and I had egg whites) but I doubt we will be back. At least he lost more weight with his regular omelet than my egg white one. I'm going to give him that win though. Watching him throw up all night was not fun."}
{"text":"The food was pretty okay, for the price. I ordered a half order of coconut pancakes. The pancakes were great! The \"tropical\" syrup it came with did not match it AT ALL. Oranges/citrus flavor and coconut??? I don't think so lol. I wasn't sure if everyone else in my party liked what they ordered or not.  But lemme tell you something. My boyfriend got the chicken crepe and IT TASTED LIKE IT CAME STRAIGHT OUT OF THE CAN, WITH SUCH SLIMEY SAUCE. I'm sorry but that was DISGUSTING and yaaaall need to really work on that, if you think that's worth it's price.  The potato pancakes are reeeeally good, though! I don't know if I'll ever come back here again. Unless it's to try the dutch baby or get more potato pancakes..  Your seating service sucks on Sunday btw. Get girls who can manage it beter."}
{"text":"This is my go-to breakfast/brunch place in Champaign-Urbana area. Although the wait is usually long, it's definitely worth it. They've got the typical pancake house fare, it's made with love and cooked fresh. I usually get the veggie scramble with a side of potatoes (definitely a good idea to add potatoes to this one) with the pancakes. This is usually a lot of food -- enough for some delicious leftovers. Someone I'm with usually gets the fresh squeezed orange juice. Their coffee is always fresh and hot and yummy -- I'm always getting refills! Stop by if you're hungry for brunch, but be ready to wait a little (and you can't call ahead to put your name on a list or anything)."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast.  Hard to park and get into most times, but well worth it.  Have the dutch baby pancake.  It's stellar."}
{"text":"Very yummy :) great with kids.. We spilled a drink and before we could ask for help they had a stack of napkins ;)"}
{"text":"Good location.  They close early though.   Wait staff is older but really good. Very very polite.  Food is cooked to order so allow time for sure if your hungry.  Coconut pancake is delicious.  Groupon makes this even better"}
{"text":"Ultimate breakfast place right outside the strip in LV!!  I would gladly get in my car and drive off strip and come here for their breakfast grub.  BFF Jen suggested this place, being a former LV local, and I was super impressed with the service and quality of food.  A spot she use to visit regularly with her farther, she ordered me his favorite breakfast dish which is the Egg Michael.  It's like an eggs Benedict at first glance but comes with sausage instead of ham and a mushroom sauce instead of hollandaise sauce and comes with a side of potato pancakes.  It was OMG delicious.  She also ordered us a dutch baby to share and this thing is sooo freaking good.  I literally liked both plates clean.   There's a chain of them, so find one near you!!"}
{"text":"Last time I reviewed on this business I was a very unsatisfied customer.... Yet I don't want anyone to not try this wonderful pancake house. From the 49ers to the monkey bread to just some buttermilk pancakes... This place is the BEST. I've been coming here for years & it's definitely a gem."}
{"text":"Ate from this restaurant 2 mornings in a row.. first time we sat in the restaurant. It was really warm (too warm) in there and got a real rushed type feeling. Hubby got corned beef which was small in general. I got pancakes.. both were ok. Just ok.  Second morning I called and tried to order take out but the woman said that you have to come in personally and order it from the bar.. I've NEVER heard or seen any restaurant do that. Get a credit card over the phone or whatever to ensure order. The whole point is to run in and pick up your food. If I wanted to wait I'd eat there?! Unfortunately when we got there it was a 30min wait and we had a flight to catch so we ordered to go.  We both got omelettes, which I have to admit, they were the fluffiest I've ever had. Flavor could've been better with better quality fillings. The tomatoes in mine were really under ripe. I wanted to try the Dutch baby but was short on time since I needed to stand there while the food was being cooked. If I could've ordered in advance I totally would've tried it! The servers, hostess and cashier were all kind of a hot mess. No smiles anywhere. It did seem really busy I admit but still.. pull it together people.. it's a breakfast place. Start the morning with a smile!"}
{"text":"The pancakes and crepes are awesome.  Sad that there is only 1 left in the Las Vegas.  I've been to the only other one in Primm and the food is just ok.  The staff is great.  Always friendly and helpful.  Sometimes there are long lines but they move fairly quickly."}
{"text":"My mom and I both used to live in Maryland and frequented one of the Original Pancake Houses in Rockville- it was our favorite place to eat breakfast. Staff were friendly and food was delicious. We had an opposite experience here in Scottsdale. First, when we walked in, the hostess looked straight at me, acknowledging me but not smiling, then turned away and kept doing whatever she was doing. About a minute later she finally came over to seat my mom and I. She brought us to our booth and literally threw the menus onto the table and just walked away. The waitress was a little friendlier, but not much. Not only was the service horrible, but the food was not good either. Hash browns tasted frozen. The only thing saving this place is that they do have good pancakes, but I really don't think it's worth it at this location. I could hear two other tables around us also complaining about the service, don't really see a reason to come back."}
{"text":"Started in Oregon this no dive. Went to one in Las Vegas and was pleasantly surprised by the brunch food and clean nice surroundings. There must be 20 styles of pancakes. There are also German and Potato types. Many are cooked with fruit and some baked. Also combos with eggs, sausage or bacon. Delicious way to spend the morning."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to eat at this restaurant all the time.  We always loved the food.  However, the last time we were there , the manager disagreed with where we asked to be seated based on the placement of our highchair.  We did not realize that it was a problem.  Afterall, the hostess sat us there.  When the manager saw what happened, he aggressively approached our table, rapped his knuckles on the table, and loudly imformed us that \"this was never happening again\".  You betcha, Buddy, because after being chewed out by this manager like I was a tardy dishwasher, we weren't coming back.  I was angry and embarassed as this manager was loud enough that people at other tables were staring at us, so I emailed the restaurant's corporate offices right there from my phone.  A few days later, I received a phone call from the restaurant's general manager.  I think that her name was Lisa. At first, I thought that Lisa was going to work this out with me, perhaps apologize for her underling's poor behavior. That just wasn't going to happen.  What Lisa gave me was a second butt chewing.  She interrupted me time and again, and even accused me of being a bad mother because the placement of the highchair was dangerous and against city code, that she was more concerned about the safety of my child than I was.  Had she stopped talking over me for 2 seconds, she would have learned that my husband is an architect and has forgotten more about building and city codes than some diner manager would ever know.  What she didn't know that my husband did know was that the placement of the highchair was well within city egress requirements.  She then claimed to have reviewed the tape of the manager approaching our table and she that the table rapping never happened.  She was lying.  It did happen.  I saw it.  My husband saw it, and my baby jumped when he did it.  She either did not review the tape or there was no tape to review.  I seriously doubt that they have cameras trained on every table in any restaurant, much less a pancake diner.    During this entire conversation, I kept trying to get a word in edgewise to complain about the way the first manager all but yelled at us.  It was awful, and soon as she was done verbally abusing me, she said goodbye and HUNG UP on me.  I was shocked.  She never had any intention of working this out.  Her intention was to bully me for daring to complain about one of her co-workers.  And sadly, we have lost one of our favorite breakfast spots because I will not contribute a nickel to that woman's salary.  I had heard, maybe it's true, maybe it's not, that several restaurants in casinos had recently closed their doors.  If this is how they allow their manager to speak to people, I am not the least bit surprised.  I have since told everyone I know about the abuse that I suffered at this woman's hands and will continue to bad mouth this restaurant every opportunity I get."}
{"text":"Pancakes are great.  Many varieties.  I had pumpkin pecan (seasonal) and they were delicious.  I ordered a sausage omelette (4-eggs and MASSIVE) was able to upgrade the buttermilk pancakes for the difference, around $1.70.  There were a couple small things I did not enjoy.  The parking is limited when busy on sat/sunday morning.  There was a wait around 30 minutes which seems to be normal.  It is cash only.  None of these things ruined my experience but it seems nice to be aware of them.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place invented the dutch baby...for that alone I am forever indebted.  Rules aside this place is amazing.  Never greasy, fluffy omelets, perfect eggs and killer pancakes served with a side of 90s Scottsdale pastel flare.  A couple of words of warning: 1) Come early...the 65+ crowd wakes up damn early.  2)  Bring cash...this place, like many other small businesses, doesn't like forking over 3% to out-of-state CC companies.  This is not a new concept...get over it.   3) If you think IHOP is better than this place, I'm sorry that you were born without taste buds.  Cheers to my Chi-town family for turning me on to this place!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Fantastic German Pancake and chocolate chip pancakes.  Prices could be better."}
{"text":"Two words banana. pancakes. I have tried and tried and tried to replicate these at home on my own and its just not happening at least not to this level. This place does breakfast like nobodies business. They have every flavor pancake that you could possibly want. I am also thrilled that they have not just turkey bacon but turkey sausage too! Nobody ever seems to have these options (pizza joints take note! turkey pepperoni hello!?) I actually had no idea that they even had more than one location besides the one in southpark at least in charlotte anyway. The other morning I woke up and my love asked me what I wanted he said I could have anything I wanted (hes the definition of amazing) I almost yelled pancakes I was so hungry.   This place not only delivered it made me wonder why I hadn't been back in so long! Everything was great the pancakes the turkey sausage the eggs and don't even get me started on their hash browns. Good gawd! I only wish they did a brunch with ya know drinks! But other than that kudos to the food and the great service as well. Definitely wont be waiting so long to return this time.   One location in southpark and one in the metropolitan area next to the abc store. Parking can be an issue during super busy times but its worth the hunt for the space."}
{"text":"I learned this morning that \"Original Pancake House\" and \"IHOP\" are two very different restaurants... and in my mind, \"IHOP\" is much better.  We ended up at this OHOP for breakfast around 11am (on a Sunday).  We were lucky enough to get a parking spot and a table within just a few minutes.  Once seated, I noticed how tacky the interior is decorated, but that is no big deal.  The big deal is that the tables are so close together there is not much room to move... and that the place doesn't take credit cards, and if you order a couple of things ala carte like we did, it really adds up...   My short stack for buckwheat pancakes, scrambled egg whites, and OJ plus Jared's eggs over easy with hashbrowns, toast, and coffee cost us $32 before tip.  For breakfast?  Really?  And our waitress could've told us, but no...  At least they made it easy by putting an ATM inside the restaurant now - too bad there is that additional $2.50 fee to use it.    Another difference I noticed is that OHOP offers only one single kind of syrup where IHOP offers many... and the pancakes are better at the latter as well.  The one thing that OHOP has going for them is their Dutch Baby - at least from the looks of it as I saw people around me ordering it.    I'll choose IHOP or one of the many locally owned breakfast places in the future before returning to OHOP.  It was $40 out the door for a simple breakfast for two today... Screw that!"}
{"text":"Have been here about 4 times now and I get progressively disappointed.  Maybe I'm ordering the wrong things.  Last time the Dutch Baby was deflated, doughy, and pretty flavorless.  Today the Pecan Pancakes were dry and the nuts tasted \"off\".  Husband is always happy with the 49er pancakes and side of lingonberries.  The thick bacon is admittedly good but not good enough for me to get excited about this over-rated, pricey breakfast place."}
{"text":"I had a chorizo Mexican omelet well prepared light fluffy pancakes were good coffee was good service was excellent"}
{"text":"The food gets 5 STARS and the service gets 2 STARS......that being said, we'll average it out with a good 'ole 3 1/2 - 4 STARS!  ~Traditional breakfast items.....bacon and eggs, diced ham and scrambled eggs, corn beef hash and eggs.  All with the options come with toast or pancakes. ~CREPES.....both sweet and savory depending on your mood! ~NON-traditional items............potato pancakes  =), German/Dutch Baby, Dutch garden  =), and  apple pancake! ~Omelets like nothing you've ever seen before in your life.  Baked in the oven, these monstrous egg creations take nearly 20 minutes to cook, but the taste and texture make it all worth it!  P.S.  they have GOUDA cheese..........which I personally LOVE!  =) ~And the obvious DUH......this place is called the PANCAKE house for a reason.........................FREAKIN' PANCAKES!!!!!!  Sourdough cakes, Swedish cakes, 49er flapjacks, banana cakes, strawberry cakes, bacon cakes, Hawaiian cakes and my personal favorite PECAN cakes! ~The orange juice is fresh squeezed and AMAZING!  True story!  ~The whipped cream is made fresh daily!  And the two negatives I have are: ~You aren't allowed to bring in outside beverages........  =(  gotta leave your Starbucks at the door kids! ~The service kinda BLOWS!  Empty beverages drives me nuts.  Utilize the bussers if you have to.........please and thank you!"}
{"text":"This place gets five stars for several reasons. 1) Service is great - not just at this location, but always, at every location I have been to. 2) The food is amazingly good. Fresh, tastes homemade and high quality. 3) Coffee - their coffee is good. Really good. Most diners don't have good coffee. 4) Bacon - it is the good stuff.   I love their swedish pancakes and the pumpkin pancakes. Next time, I am trying the cherry crepes."}
{"text":"Look 3 Stars is not a BAD thing, Just means you are just like everyone else out there. Pancake house is, no personality on wait staff, Always feel uncomofortable when I am in a place that has to turn over tables to make a profit, I would not mind paying an Additional 1 or 2 for the meal and not have them say, is there anything else you need?  Then when you do ask for the check takes 5 mins + to get it.  Food is good, Service is a 3(ie GOOD),   Oh, One other thing we sat outside on the metal chairs and the wife and I ended up with Rust Spots on the As..um...er..Ah, BEHINDS. (Repaint time Pancake House)  Other than that not a bad place to grab Breakfast and keep it real people, they are a 3."}
{"text":"Such a go-to breakfast spot for my family and I. We go pretty early and never have to wait. OJ is fresh and our absolute favorite is the Dutch baby, it's a combo of a pancake and a crepe! Can't get it anywhere else - try it!"}
{"text":"The omelets here are amazing!!  My husband and I split an omelet and side of pancakes (the pecan pancakes are the best!)  We both love the fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juices - they are both truly FRESH SQUEEZED!  Mmmm my mouth is watering thinking about it!    Quite often on Saturdays there is a balloon lady who goes from table to table making balloon animals for children.  We have a 4.5 year old, so this is a very nice feature!  We really love going here and will certainly continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Such great service! I was blown away by how fast we got our food. My cousin is a picky eater and our server Jessica B was more than attentive to her needs. She was friendly and quick even as she was showing a newbie the ropes. I've never seen someone carry so many plates with such grace and speed .It's great to see the original pancake house takes the time to onboard their new employees and train them properly while still being able to provide excellent service. My blueberry pancakes were to die for and all my food arrived hot and looking like an Instagram photo. Just had to share my great experience !"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love The Original Pancake House! We have eaten at the Chicago location and the St Louis location and always had wonderful food and service. We went to the Las Vegas location with high hopes of a good breakfast. It was absolutely horrible! The service was NOT good and neither was the food. I will definitely try another location but I will never return to this one."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best bacon anywhere! I usually do full order of bacon and cheese hashbrowns and split with someone..Or my fave the French toast platter with strawberries and whipped cream topping for under $10!! So delicious!! Fresh OJ can't be beat either! The price is right and the food is fresh! I love!"}
{"text":"I don't normally like breakfast food. Before I came to the OG Pancake House, I had never eaten potato pancakes or eggs benedict. After coming here, I'm hooked on both. Or at least, the pancake house version of both. Breakfast here was absolutely incredible. Never been to a diner that was as friendly or prompt. Easy enough to get in and get out on a monday morning.  The eggs benedict was delight from start to finish. The bread balances out the goopiness of the cheese, and the salty meat really hits the spot. Just combines really well, easier to eat than you'd think. The potato pancakes were just as good, as they tasted like lighter hashbrowns. Mixing in the applesauce and sour cream was delicious as well.   Also, my coffee cup literally never hit half full. That's how crazy on point the service was. If you're in the area at the right time, do yourself a favor and go here!!!! Get your OG pancakes on! I'll be back for sure if I'm ever in Madison."}
{"text":"By far one of the best breakfast spots in Charlotte. I have been going here since I was a child in New Jersey. They have several locations throughout the country and 2 in the Charlotte area.  I had a western omelette that came with 3 pancakes. The pancakes were fluffy and the omelet was made to perfection and really can be split between 2 people. Definitely try the blueberry or banana pancakes you definitely won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This has to be the best breakfast/brunch place around town. Been here multiple times and everything I've ordered has been delicious. Not to mention the servings are quite large! The place itself is very cosy with a homey feel to it. There can be a long wait time depending on what time of the day or what day of the week you go here, sometimes the line can be out the door but trust me, the food is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great omelet and pancakes. I love their whipped cream!!! Whipped cream at this restaurant makes everything taste extra delicious."}
{"text":"This was awesome!  We stopped here based on a recommendation and so glad we did!  The 49ers was delicious and my sons had the pigs in a blanket and chocolate chip pancakes.  Would DEFINITELY come back when in Champaign again."}
{"text":"I honestly can not comprehend how people are not completely happy with these pancakes. These are the best pancakes I have ever had. Blows IHOP, Dennys, and any diner that I've been to while living in NY, out of the water. I usually get chocolate chip pancakes, and pour some hot syrup on it. Delicious! Some times I get a (HUGE) omelet with Ham, Bacon, Chorizo, and American. Also Delicious!  Only reason they lose a star is I wasn't a fan of their eggs Benedict, and their short opening times.  This places need to be 24 hours for those late night meals, though! PLEASE!"}
{"text":"Great food at a good price, and a nice location. Get here early, though! It draws a crowd but the service is quick and people are in and out. We always go for pancakes, eggs Benedict (with potato pancakes and apple sauce!) or the omelets (which are HUGE by the way - i think they are something like five eggs, you could definitely share it.)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast / lunch in Las Vegas!  Every restaurant has the same boring menu, especially at breakfast. At this place every menu item is unique and done with a special twist.   Many different offerings, each very different and done like no other.   I won't list them all here. Just review the menu for yourself and then go and try it out!  Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Pancakes were delicious! However, I concur with the other reviews regarding the omelettes. I ordered the spinach omelette (egg whites only) and it was waaay too fluffy. The texture was similar to marshmallow fluff and not very flavorful. But again, the pancakes were DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.   Every thing is home made.   Not kidding the buttermilk pancakes are airy & fluffy served steaming hot.   The entire order was hot."}
{"text":"The Omelettes here are light, airy, fluffy, and delicious because of the fact that they are oven baked.   We also liked their pancakes, BUT no one tops Du-Pars, IMO....  Wifey tried the pigs in a blanket, but it was just okay, not something we'd order again. If there ever is a return visit, my next mission will be to  ATTACK THE DUTCH BABY!!!! ALOHA!!!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(29/365) \"Break the fast\""}
{"text":"We came to breakfast and waited for about 10 minutes to be seated. Our server Marc was very polite and helpful. He was patient with us while we decided what we wanted to eat and brought our beverages. Then we ordered and he asked us up front if we wanted our checks to be separate which I appreciated. The food came out in a timely fashion. We ordered Corned beef hash and scrambled eggs, strawberry pancakes, an apple Belgian waffle, a Mediterranean omelet, a vegetarian omelet, a side of hash browns and grits. The Mediterranean omelet was great. It had chicken, black olives, feta cheese, and spinach. The omelet was flavorful and none of the items overpowered the others. The vegetarian omelet had spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, and cheese. It was awesome. The omelets were large enough to feed 2 people. It was light and fluffy. Both omelets came with a side of buttermilk pancakes that melted in your mouth. The syrup was not too sweet but left a smooth but subtle aftertaste. The strawberry pancakes were the same but the homemade whipped cream was a bonus. The strawberry syrup was sweet and subtle and contributed to the fresh strawberries. The hash browns were more like diced potatoes and were not hard but not soft. They were pan seared and had a little crunch too them. The Apple Belgian waffle with apple syrup had diced apple pieces that were marinated with cinnamon and brown sugar. It came with apple syrup which complemented the waffle and it was not too sweet. The Corned beef hash had a crispy outside but the inside was flavorful and moist. The hash and potatoes ratio was perfect and the potatoes were cooked all the way through. At the end, Marc brought us to go containers and to go beverages. He made sure that we had everything we needed. He is a great server and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very delicious and hearty breakfast. The German potatoes are awesome (server informed me that whether it says German potatoes or German hash browns they are the same thing.) Fresh squeezed OJ was really tasty. My sister who lives in Las Vegas said we were really lucky that we didn't have to wait because mornings on the weekends it is apparently really crowded and hard to get a table."}
{"text":"Sat immediately with smile.  Waiter Jesse? Fast friendly efficient.   Food came out about 8 min maybe 9 wow!  Very fair pricing and portions.  Was surprised since my last 2 stops to eat breakfast today we're much much higher priced.    No music so a bit blah.  Decor needs some personalty even if u want to stay neutral u cud add something to it.   Service and food and prices 4 star decor 2."}
{"text":"I can't imagine a better place to eat unusual Pancakes. My favorite has become the \"Dutch Baby,\" a smaller version of the German, served with butter, powdered sugar and lemon! Decadent, but a wonderful taste and with the texture of a popover.  Accompanying \"sides\" like bacon, and egg, etc., are equally skillfully prepared.  Oh, the place is a little old and right out of the 50's but a better breakfast in Phoenix, I am still looking!"}
{"text":"This place was good that we came here twice during my stay in Las Vegas. Both times the food was fabulous.  The portions are quite sizable so my friend and I split an omelet (Denver and added mushrooms) and we got the Swedish pancakes which are like crepes.    The omelet is so fluffy and delicious and the ingredients just melted in your mouth. Perhaps the best omelet I've ever had. One morning we also got the banana pancakes but they weren't as good as the Swedish ones and I would only get those from this point on.  The service was wonderful and we didn't wait to be seated either time. Definitely worth the drive. I will be back here on my next Vegas trip for sure."}
{"text":"Should of given 0 stars . Ordered breakfast found hair in my food not one but a lot. Complained to the manager n he came buy through receipt n said o well stay away go to McDonald's very disappointing"}
{"text":"Food was served ice cold and took forever. Told owner of the issue and he argued with us and basically called us liars. Will never go back"}
{"text":"Despite the fact that I could walk into just about any place in town for a pancake related meal and belly right up to an open table, I prefer the wait-required, OPH.   My favorite is the apple pancake which is baked with caramel and sliced granny smith apples. When it comes to your table pipping hot, it has risen from baking and as you watch it deflate and cool the mouthwatering makes you check your pant leg to ensure you still have a napkin. Make sure you can wait the 40 or so minutes it takes for this one.   While the Jr version of this pancake is still a bountiful portion, I love adding a side of home style fries. They cut the potatoes to about a half inch or so and add onions and bell peppers, so tasty.   As a creature of habit I can at times manage to sway myself to order something else on the menu. The banana pancakes actually have mashed  bananas worked into the pancake batter and it's really spectacular. The Lingonberry crepes sometimes come in handy when I can't scrape up enough cash to go to Holland. The omelets are also baked and worth the time it takes to get to you.   I've been going to this place for almost 20 years now and I have never had bad service or a dish that wasn't wonderful."}
{"text":"I always go at least twice when I visit my folks in LV.  I stick to the pancakes (duh), but the omlettes aren't too bad either.  The dutch baby (which my mom always orders) does take 20 minutes, so if someone else orders it, you might be in for a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"I've never been to the Original Pancake House when it wasn't jam-packed. There's always been a wait (although the bunker of seating near the entrance is comfortable enough)--and for good reason. The food there rocks.   The coffee may just be decent, but the mainline buttermilk pancakes are amazing. The link sausage is delicious. The loaded American fried potatoes (cheddar cheese, bits of crisped slab bacon) have brought me back after years spent going elsewhere. No matter when I hit the Original House, as our family calls it, I'm sure I'll get consistently good breakfast food -- good ingredients, well prepared. Consistency and quality. The service is also always hopping and professional, too.   The only real downside to visiting the Original House is the hustle and bustle all around you while you wait. The tables (there are a lot of them) are fairly close together and with every one of them full and the waitstaff circulating in between, the activity and noise can get to be a bit much. That is, until your pancakes arrive, and then who really cares because pancakes. There are no bad pancake choices and so many choices to make."}
{"text":"Very cute, simple, good breakfast. Good coffee, I went with pumpkin pancakes which were awesome, with egg whites and potatoes - I was a big fan of Charlotte overall, and would return for breakfast when there."}
{"text":"My husband and I don't make it to brunch very often but when we do we usually head here for the 49'ers pancakes with blueberry syrup! This time we also got their eggs Benedict special and it was great! Also they take credit cards now which is helpful!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see there was an OPH location by our hotel since we love OPH in Michigan (our home state). We visited this location this past Monday, and sat at the bar since there wasn't a wait for that area. The decor, waitress and food were meh at best.  What we saw take place behind the bar has made us non-repeat customers of this location. A younger waitress with light brown hair in a ponytail used bar cloths to wipe up spills of beverages on the floor two different times, and then put the cloths on the counter to use again a short while later...which was to wipe the inside of a refrigerated wall unit holding milk and juice. About 15 minutes after that, she was pouring tea into a glass and put her thumb inside to wipe off something, and then proceeded to fill the glass and take it to a customer.  Needless to say, absolutely disgusting and likely health violations as well. We will never return nor recommend to others."}
{"text":"Finally made it to the Original Pancake House, never been, but have heard they do carry a selection of different pancakes. I have wanted to check out this place, I host an monthly breakfast club that runs on Sat, and though that this could be a cool place to check out, but when reading the menu it clearly states that they can host parties of up to 30 people, but on WEEKDAYS only, well guess this place is out of the BC loop.  When I 1st walked in a few things hit me  1) Plenty of signs on the door, inside the place and around the place that elude you to believe it's a cash only place and they have an ATM inside the joint, but on the door it states they take Visa & MasterCard, yep skipped the ATM fee and I ponied up the Visa  2) Did I just go to Miami? The inside of the place is painted as a cool little beach diner, white/cream and aqua colors, but like a 50's cool diner, this wasn't an new place   3) Signs stating to turn off Cell phones, um ok, I understand that in a small room it would be sort of rude to carry on a conversation, but people can text, and well play games, my phone was set to silent and while I was waiting to be waited on I did text & play a game   4) Hope the people around you are friendly because they are sitting just an elbow bump away, but it was ok with us, had a nice couple next to us and he commented on how it's like dinning on a cruise being close to fellow diners.  5) I being 40 felt like the new kid on the block, so I'm guess my daughter who is 22 felt really young haha  Also, again on being close to everyone you can hear what others are ordering or not ordering, and on the menu it stated that the house specialty is the Apple Pancake, and I was interested in trying it, but overheard another table inquiring about it and they were told it was a 45 min wait for the Apple Pancakes, and it's not that I was in a rush I just wasn't into waiting 45 mins to try it, maybe call a head for it?   After checking out the menu, and yes they have a few different types of pancakes, but nothing really wowed me, but I did see a Bacon stuffed pancake and you betcha that's what I ordered and ordered a side of home fries. The pancakes come with real butter and 2 ounces of syrup, for me that was not enough I like a little bit of pancake with my sweet sticky maple syrup, I did ask for more, but it still wasn't enough, some/most of the pancakes were dry, and I don't like them that way, but the bacon was a thick slice bacon, so very good, bacon and maple syrup is the best combo ever!   The home fries looked amazing, but they were under cooked, the potatoes were a little to hard for me.   Service was slow, it was weekday morning, so the place was semi steady , we were not check on to see if we needed/wanted anything but after 5 mins of getting our food our bill was presented to us and I was told we can take care of that at the front, kind of felt like it was a hurry up eat and get out kind of thing.  Glad I finally stopped by to check them out, but even with the few types of pancakes, I'm not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Einfach ein großartiges Frühstück. Auch zum Omelett gibts drei Pancakes. Alles frisch und die Portionen sind riesig!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times with my friends and this place is as good as they say! Today I had the diced ham scrambled eggs and added cheese. I also had the pumpkin pancakes and they were amazing!! Service was a little slow but totally understandable for a late Sunday morning. Our server also gave us an extra stack of pancakes, but I'm not complaining about it!!"}
{"text":"Okay I've come here three times and each time I was just NOT impressed. The food isn't bad, but it doesn't jump out at me either. I'd feel much more satisfied cooking at home.  I understand that you can't win everyone, I'm just not a fan of a dutch baby. It tastes egg-y. As if it was super under cooked."}
{"text":"I love the oldies look of the place.  Nice that they accept credit cards now.  I remember they did not back in the day.  I had the baked ham and cheese omelette with hash browns and buttermilk pancakes.  I can say my food was ok, nothing special...  The service was good.  Why the 3 stars?  My friend that was with me found hair in her baked egg pancake thing (I don't remember that it was called).  She was lucky I shared my food with her until she got her own."}
{"text":"Love this place, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  They serve coffee the right way with real creamer on the side.  Very solid bacon too."}
{"text":"lets just say the one in Anaheim, Ca is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY better and i like the decor much better. feels antique-ish  this one here is modern is like a ihop. but they have better items than ihop.  Split the dutch baby and cheese omelette!  dutch baby was really good!!! lemon & powdered sugar was already delicious!! most people add strawberries or other stuff in it.  cheese omelet was good as well. you cant mess up an omelette at a breakfast place, can you?  portions was large & totally worth it! service was awesome here!!! seriously."}
{"text":"Ok....so I love this place I get the spinach crepe every time. It's awesome. Cheese mushrooms, spinach rolled inside a crepe with hollandaise on top. It comes with potato pancakes and A side of Apple sauce. I usually have bite of my friends pancakes and they are really good. It's like 11.99 for plenty of food.  There are inexpensive breakfast meals for less ten dollars. The orange juice is freshly squeezed which is always a plus in my book.  It's got a great menu and I wish I could try everything.  The service is mediocre but hey it's breakfast and lunch in Vegas. So the rude attitudes and long wait times are kind of part and parcel for this city."}
{"text":"Went back a couple weeks ago and it is still great.  Since I am a \"single\" seating is quick, but don't bet on that for groups as it is a crowded place.  Service:  great Food:  wonderful  Go....don't delay"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and service was outstanding. Everyone's plate looked like it should be on a food porn site.  It was our 1st time there and the manager heard so he treated us  to the house specialty of the amazing apple pancakes!"}
{"text":"German pancake (bigger size of the dutch baby), and corned beef hash with egg on top, Eggs Benedicts and a side of breakfast links, can't go wrong. had the sweetest and most polite lady server ever, really cute didn't catch her name though."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place that is always crowded. The food is pretty good and the portions are sizable. The menu is a bit limited and the prices are a little more than I might spend on breakfast, but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great choice for breakfast/brunch! I have been to this specific location many times and never had a bad experience.   I have been to multiple OHOP locations, yes this restaurant is a chain, and this one is by far the best. The food is cooked well and comes out quickly, even on a busy day. That being said, you never have to wait too long for a table, even when the place is packed.   The service is always friendly, from the moment you walk in the door. The excellent staff creates a really happy atmosphere that must rub off on the customers because everyone here seems to always be in a particularly great mood.   I am a bit of a germaphobe and can say that I am impressed by the cleanliness of this location. I have never sat in a sticky booth or sat down to a dirty table.    Overall, I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, the Dutch Delight is the perfect blend of a filling wholesome breakfast and fresh fruit goodness... It's like my birthday and Christmas rolled into one! Delicious. The pancake is so incredibly fluffy, shaped like a giant pie crust, and stuffed with sweet juicy strawberries and bananas!  As for service... Well, let's just say my coffee mug never gets below an inch from the top. The server comes around for refills every few minutes. But then again, it is 7:30 in the morning, with only a few tables. It might be different when the place fills up in about an hour... Not sure."}
{"text":"Cell Phone Na*is  WOW  i was at the counter next to the wall with no one else at the counter or around me. and i was quietly saying good morning to my wife and daughter while waiting for my breakfast and this old lady waitress comes up to me with a nasty look and points to a sign that say Cell Phones OFF underlined and shakes her head at me with a nasty look on her face. I should have left then. At a table close to me was a family playing with an ipad making all kinds of noise (which i am ok with) and she said that wasn't a cell phone. I said so my conversation is louder than anyone else talking to each other in here? I had been almost whispering. She said its policy and turned her head. Breakfast was OK. Omelet is really big and fluffy..little too many eggs for me but OK. Home fries were average. Pancakes were awesome! When leaving i told the cashier how it ruined my breakfast and she got mean and said its policy and turned her head. I asked her about the family  on the ipad and she also said not a cell phone. I told her i was here for 8 days and would have come here every day but i would NEVER come there again. I also let everyone waiting in line ( Saturday ) to know to turn off their cell phones.... its policy!"}
{"text":"Your standard Original Pancake House. Filling breakfasts/brunches. Not too pricey. Friendly service. And refillable coffee, very important. Chocolate chip pancakes are bomb. Pumpkin pancakes, when in season, are a must. Veggie and Spanish omelettes are tasty and massive.   Expect a wait on the weekends. And expect to be very, very full."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! My boyfriend and I split the chicken crepe and Venetian Benedict... best breakfast I've had in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The Dutch delite is not like the original fluffy pancake but it is a bit chewy and has crunchy crust. Huge portion and a good place to get comfort food. Nothing was amazing for me though. And they only accept cash"}
{"text":"What can I say? This place is hands down my favorite breakfast place. The blueberry waffle blew me away and the crispy bacon was perfect! They have anything you could possibly want for breakfast."}
{"text":"The wait is soooo worth it!!!!! French toast with strawberries will have you feelin like heaven is on earth and it's food... #JustMelApproved #FoodFromHeaven"}
{"text":"The OPH is a little hole in the wall next to a Motel 6, just before Fashion Square. It may seem a little dingy at first, but its breakfast, not an elegant dinner. Every time I have been here I have enjoyed the food.   I have become fond of the Banana Pancakes. They are served with chunks of bananas in the batter. I believe they come with coconut flakes on top, but I hold those since I am not a fan. They are oh so good. There regular breakfast is good too. I am usually pretty bland when it comes to breakfast. Just give me some bacon, eggs, and hash browns and I'm good. Most selections come with pancakes and for a small fee you can substitute speciality pancakes. The waffles are good too, they are big just like everything else here.   It would have been 5 stars if not for the whole, \"we don't accept plastic\" deal. Just plan ahead or use the ATM machine they now have. I should have gotten in that business and sold them one. Damn it!"}
{"text":"5 Stars based on Quality, 3 Stars based on overpricing and just mediocre service. So A 4 star overall. For the price of the food they should really be more attentive and not nickel and dime you so much they charge you for just about everything and always try to up sell you, which I don't like. But if you are rich and don't care about spending $60 on breakfast The food is amazing some of the best. The Bacon is always fresh and crisp, The German pancake is awesome with lemon and powder sugar. The French toast is great, Nutella crepes awesome, Oh and the omelets best in town.  I am lucky I have a good job so I can afford to come back because it is always around $20 to $30 a person for Breakfast Ouch."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places I've had in Charlotte. Staff is also very friendly and patient. Food is delicious I haven't had one thing from there that I didn't like. Definitely recommend going on a weekday since they can get pretty busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"Went once before and it wasn't memorable for some reason. It was just okay from what I remember. But this time around was 5 stars for sure. Delicious and great service. Excellent combo. The server always came back to check on us and brought all our food in a timely manner. Price wasn't too bad either. We went here for Eid breakfast. We all eat together after prayer, annual tradition.   IHOP is usually super packed so we stopped going there. It was busy but not too bad. It was about 18 of us. The food was great and I usually box up most my food to go but I ate it all.   Fresh and healthy options too. It's a little higher than IHOP but so much better food wise. It was about 220 without tip for all of us. I thought it be a lot more. People ordered a lot of food. Great location too. Will def go back."}
{"text":"The food here is always good. this place can get very packed on the weekends so honestly plan ahead. Also it's worth the wait.  If you ask for OJ you will get fresh squeezed OJ and it's oh so good. The dutch baby is so yummy big enough to share. Their apple pancake tastes like an apple pie. My family and friends have eaten here so many times over the years and we have never had a bad time. Staff is always great food is always amazing. Even the coffee is good!"}
{"text":"Definitely a place to go if you want an old fashioned American breakfast. They have a big menu with a lot of options to choose from; offering pancakes, crepes, waffles, eggs and more. My personal favorite are the Oatmeal Cinnamon Raisin pancakes. They thankfully offer half orders for those of us who can't eat 6 pancakes in one sitting.  The service is great with friendly staff. It gets pretty crowded on the weekends so plan to be waiting for 20-30 min before being seated."}
{"text":"Amazing pancakes and oven backed omelettes! The food is absolutely incredible and very inexpensive. Something in the pancake batter makes them insanely good. The service is usually pretty decent, nothing amazing but nothing bad. The restaurant itself is party average, looks like a Denny's or ihop."}
{"text":"Breakfast for lunch? Yes, please! The food isn't great, but it's good enough when you want steak and eggs in the afternoon. Service is excellent and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"Nice fluffy pancakes and the waitress made sure the coffee was flowing. No complaints!"}
{"text":"I have never liked breakfast foods and I think it is because places like the Original Pancake House are too few and far between!  I always get the hash and eggs for breakfast here.  Outstanding hash - super salty and finely chopped.  The coffee is excellent here and the waitresses are great about topping off your cup.  They have hot sauce but you have to ask for it.  The hash and egg combo comes with hotcakes - someone will have to roll you out of there in a wheel barrow!!  Reasonable prices (pay at the front).  Get here early!  Always gets packed.  This location is a little sketchy - we have had homeless guys asking for money in the parking lot - ug."}
{"text":"An oven-baked pancake??  Maybe I live under a rock but until last Saturday I had never heard of such a thing.  Too bad I don't like pancakes.  They are like rollercoasters....looks tempting but really a waste of time.  The baked pancake my friend got looked beautiful and he finished the whole thing - it was as big as a 12-inch plate and two inches thick.  OMG.  So for those pancake lovers out there - this is your place!!!    Well for my meal I had the corned-beef sandwich and it was fantastic (except I know for next time to order it without the weird thick cheese).  And I had a side of corned-beef hash.  I never knew this was what it was supposed to taste like.  My mom gave us corned-beef hash out of a can.  I knew nothing about the real thing until this blessed day.  Sigh.....I could make a meal out of it.  Salty and crisped on the grill to perfection.  I was in heaven.  Absolutely a perfect meal.    Service was super fast and friendly.  The wait was a bit long but it was a Saturday at brunch so I kinda think you will just have to expect to wait if you go at peak times like that.  YUM!!!"}
{"text":"The place is amazing and has truly changed my life. The people employed here are efficient, friendly, and dedicated as many of them are very long-standing. That speaks volumes about the leadership of this establishment. The food is RIDICULOUSLY delicious and this spot is great for meetings as well as friends/family time. Most quaint restaurant in the area - A given! I have become the number one fan of the owner here over the past year - Love that guy! Keep up the good work OPH!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since early childhood, and I love it. The only problem is the crowds! You either have to get there really early, like 7:00am, or later, around noon. Either that or come on a weekday morning. I'm addicted to their strawberry syrup, and their hash browns are divine. Come here for a good breakfast!"}
{"text":"I guess I could say that post op, everything taste good, but I think the food here would be good at any time.  In my still groggy state I decided on just the buttermilk pancakes and side of bacon and my wife had just hash browns and side of bacon and everything was delish (5/5).  The service was fast and she was friendly with the obligatory \"hope you feel better\" (5/5).  It's a cool vibe too as the building is sort of nestled off the road just a bit.  Great food and service!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are always on the lookout for great breakfasts- and Original Pancake House in Scottsdale has been one of our favorites for years.  we just went today and it never fails to meet our high expectations! We have our standard cheese and veggie omelet that is one of the best you'll find anywhere- and their pancakes are a perfect pairing! so light and delicious. the service is as great as the food! It is a chain but they are all different and this location is one of the best we have been to!"}
{"text":"Best bacon ever! Awesome service, we are now regulars. Love their fluffy omelets and pancakes. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great service and good food. It's a standard classic breakfast place that has all the expected menu items. I had the pancakes one morning and eggs another and both came out really good."}
{"text":"Exactly the same food I grew up eating (and loving) as I lived across the street from their location on Bellevue in downtown Chicago.  This location is kind of depressing decor-wise, but hey, you're there to eat, not to watch an episode of HGTV.  Fluffy, oven-baked omelettes, Dutch Babies, thick-cut bacon -- everything is top notch and cooked to order. Even their coffee is first-rate. You can't go wrong with anything you order.  Our service was spectacular. We had a group of ten and our server never missed a beat. Everything was delivered to our table at the same time, which is hard to do with a large group. We had a number of sides and special orders; nothing was missing and everything was cooked as specified. I'm not sure if that's because one of our group is a very regular customer, but judging by the way she handled all of her other tables, I'd say that the servers here are on top of their game.  It was nice to have a little taste of home away from home."}
{"text":"Glad we came here great food fast service even on a Sunday morning. Me and my wife will be back."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this place for breakfast while on vacation. The food was very good! The waitress was friendly and did a great job! They told us it would be 20-30 minutes to wait, but, we only waited about 15 minutes!  It felt pretty crammed inside though, we were super close to two other tables on each side of us. Maybe 2 feet away on each side, we ended up talking to a family next to us! Felt like the polite thing to do too since we were almost having breakfast together! Overall we didn't mind and it wasn't too bothersome! But I do prefer a little more space when eating."}
{"text":"Went here for a breakfast treat. The wait was pretty short since we came in the afternoon.  Please be mindful for when you walk in because it was a little confusing.   We were seated within 5 minutes and our waiter took our drink orders immediately.  We had a chance to chat a little bit and the food came out rather quickly as well.  We were pleased that everything came out correctly and was freshly prepared.   The food tasted great and the waiter was there to take away the dishes really quickly.  I would come back for the food."}
{"text":"This place has literally become my go-to breakfast spot to bring friends to that are from Charlotte and out of Charlotte. As an avid lover of all things brunch, the best perk of OPH is that you always leave feeling full for a great price. Even on a busy Saturday, my friend and I were able to be seated quickly, with our meal arriving at our table soon after we ordered. There are no misses when it comes to ordering - if i could eat the hashbrowns all day, I would! Looking forward to coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"First, the story - In early May we were in and, per my usual, I begged for them to bring back their \"seasonal\" Pumpkin Pecan Pancakes for the summer. Drew, the owner, said he would have them for us on Mother's Day. The day came, and we called ahead to check and he had forgotten and felt so bad. Fast forward two weeks. We come in for breakfast, and as soon as Drew sees me he shouts \"I have them!\" [Insert power high-five here!] He told me that after failing on his promise, he resolved to have them available until I made it in...not knowing when that would be. It truly made my day to have received that kind of special service.(Awesome waitress Michelle and I had a special celebratory moment as well!) I challenge anyone to match that level of customer care!   So, for the rest of my review...I cannot say enough good things about this place! This is our family breakfast place because it honestly feels like home. The food is really great comfort food, and also really consistent (a hard-to-find quality in Madison). There is lots of variety so you don't get bored of the menu, and things are well-made. Favorites - Ancorra coffee, PUMPKIN PECAN PANCAKES, apple waffle, fresh strawberries (which they won't serve if they are not good), and eggs benedict (best hollandaise I've found in Madison, light and lemony). The staff is plentiful and there to help everyone. No one passes you over. The prices are incredibly affordable and the portions are plentiful. Be prepared to wait on the weekends...it's worth it! And they have things to keep you occupied while you do. Grab some friends and check it out!"}
{"text":"It can be hard to find a restaurant that makes a good traditional American breakfast. If that is what you are looking for, the Original Pancake House is just what the doctor ordered. I order the Western Omelet, which includes three buttermilk pancakes. A large glass of fresh squeezed orange juice helps wash it all down. They have a large selection of breakfast dishes. OPH is a great place to have breakfast!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. The omelets are gargantuan and incredible. I don't even play around with anything else because it's such an amazing deal to get a giant omelet with pancakes, then upgrade the pancakes to chocolate chip or something for an extra couple bucks. The service is great here too. I've been here several times and have never left disappointed."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was cute, staff was friendly. My eggs (over medium) were perfect, and the thick cut bacon did not disappoint. However, the gluten free blueberry pancakes did not agree with me. I wouldn't say I have a serious gluten intolerance, but I do avoid it if I can. They tasted delicious, but I wouldn't recommend these if you indeed are gluten intolerant. Stick to the eggs and bacon."}
{"text":"I usually order approximately 6 different things when I eat at OPH.  There are no other restaurants where you can actually like that many things at once.  I'm also a huge fan of the servers, some of which I have recognized for my entire life.  I don't think you can beat that for charm."}
{"text":"Two things are just awesome here, the omelettes and the german pancakes.  I orginally tried this place at Green Valley Ranch but the wait there can be long.  This location is off the strip and much quicker.  I was fascinated by the german pancake concept, powdered sugar, lemon and berries, Wow unreal and delicious. The vegetarian omelette is so incredibly good with gouda cheese, I just get a side of bacon to go along with it.  Their bacon is also very good.  I have been to many different ones from the Los Angeles area to Fremont, CA.  I like this location the best, not everyone has gouda cheese.  No matter how strange it looks try the german pancake, its like a yolky crepe texture but so wonderful.  I can't wait to be back in Vegas just for this breakfast!"}
{"text":"As long as I have been coming here I have never been unhappy with the visit. From the long waits to the large crowds I love coming here and I LOVE, LOVE the food."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! It's like IHOP except it's much better. You get the good things about IHOP (the great pancake selection, the great syrup selection, and the all day breakfast) but it's less chain-like. Breakfast was cheap, service was good, and the coffee was hot.  I got the Three Pigs in a Blanket. We're talkin' bout 3 big links of sausage wrapped in buttermilk pancakes and topped with powdered sugar. It came with plenty of butter that was perfectly soft without being melted. The 3 Pigs in a Blanket were so good that I wish I were eating it right now. I added two eggs to my meal for a few bucks. These were the most freakishly big eggs I've ever seen in my life! The 2 eggs are almost enough for a meal. This was breakfast at a very high level.  +1 Star for having Tabasco and Texas Pete hot sauce. Sometimes a man feels like Tabasco and sometimes he feels like Texas Pete."}
{"text":"Breakfast and the service are always great.  Lots of omelette and pancake options.  One of our regular breakfast spots."}
{"text":"They have a great breakfast at a great price.  If you're looking for traditional breakfast (pancakes, waffles, bacon, sausage and eggs)- this is the place to go.  This location seems to be less busy than South Park, which is really nice. They also use the No Wait app. The service was personable but at the same time, they get you in and out quickly."}
{"text":"This breakfast was great, for a great price! It's definitely busy on weekends, but worth the wait. Everything was delicious - the pancakes, waffles, eggs, bacon and sausage, but definitely not for someone on a diet. They also use the app \"no wait.\""}
{"text":"The best breakfast place in Champaign, Illinois. I've never had a bad experience here. Coffee is always good, food is prepared in a timely fashion, service is useful, etc. The wait can be rather long sometimes though."}
{"text":"We were visiting Charlotte for a Panthers game, and we were going to go to this other restaurant I had been looking at, when I realized they didn't serve breakfast on the weekends. So by luck I found The Original Pancake House. It was soooo goood. So many options to choice from, portions were huge, and you could tell everything was fresh and scratch made. We went during peak time on a Saturday and we only had to wait 25 mins. Once we sat down and ordered it only took 10 mins before we got our food. Halfway through our meal my boyfriend and I decided we would be back before we went back home to try their Dutch Baby. If your unsure where you should go, give this place a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place has good breakfast with a great selection. Its nothing special or fancy, but the pancakes are awesome with one of the most diverse selections I've seen.   Don't like how they only accept cash and have a \"no cell phone\" policy. If I'm paying to eat somewhere, I don't want to be told I can't talk on my phone when I want to. I could understand if it was a high-end establishment...but they don't event accept debit cards here lol."}
{"text":"Love this place! Haven't had a bad meal yet!! Really like the fresh strawberry pancakes or the bacon pancakes (sounds weird but really delish). Any of their omelletes are good. Especially the Fresh Vegetarian. I normally get the eggs benedict and one of their specialty coffees they serve in a french press. Be prepared to wait - don't think I've ever waited over twenty minutes. Well worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"I came here because I was lured by the coupons on Restaurant.com, and lets just say I m glad I used that coupon. There is no way I would pay full price for the quality of food I was served and the price listed. I got 6 very thin buttermilk pancakes for $7. And a slice of ham costs like $5? I got a better deal eating at the signatures with an all american breakfast platter that costs $11.    If you are coming here to find some great steals on mom and pop style off the strip hidden gems, and this is definitely the wrong place. Its over priced, and not worth the hype and drive. Go some where else like Egg & I or your local hotel."}
{"text":"Great service and good portion sizes for what you pay. We went on a Saturday morning relatively early and had no trouble getting a table. By the time we left, there was a huge line. Very organized staff, though, for such a large restaurant. Highly recommend the buttermilk pancakes, and FYI the OJ is fresh-squeezed. Make sure you get a glass if you're thirsty!"}
{"text":"Why this place is recommended, I have no idea. Took mother in law and rest of family for her bday. Food is grossly over priced and quality is average at best. I had the corned beef hash breakfast. Must have been the scrapings from bottom of the pan. Dried out. Another had the pecan waffles. Looked and tasted like Eggo  frozen, 5 pecans sprinkled on top. Spouse had crepes which came with side of what looked and tasted like Campbell cream of mushroom soup, yuck. Everyone commented what is that? Others had omelette plates but were not impressed. Cost of meal without tip $85. So you're looking at around 100 for this junk. Place is attached to Motel 6, why people are waiting to get in I'll never know. Never again. Better go to the Good Egg, Butterfields on Shea blvd., Cracker Barrel, Denny's, or IHOP. You actually get what you pay for there. Huge ripoff.  P.S. Better have your cellphone turned off or mute lest you be admonished by staff for disobeying their rules. This isn't the Phoenician or Ruth's Chris, give me a break."}
{"text":"Great food in a IHOP style. But everything was excellent. I had the harsh brown and egg combination. It was delicious and it wasn't a bad price. Waiter was great as he brought our ticket to our table in order to expedite our departure. Only draw back, was the parking area was limited especially if it's a packed house."}
{"text":"I have to tell you that it pains me to give the restaurant by this name such a crappy review rating. I have been to two others of these in southern California and they are both 5*s in my book (and everyone I go there with every time I go down to visit). So, maybe I had high expectations. But no, I think they truly earned a 2. They may not even have a chance to redeem themselves with me. First impressions are SO important.   We went on Friday morning pretty much during peak breakfast time for most that do not get up at the crack of dawn. It was about 930am. We fully expected a wait for breakfast and as we suspected we had one. The young man functioning as host had a rather unique method. He did not write anyones names down, he just tried to remember who was who and in what order, even as people filed in. I guess it seemed to work ok as we did not hear any fights and got seated in a timely fashion. (Thank goodness for being a party of two and being able to sit at a little table.)  I knew ahead of time what I wanted to order, though I was concerned that it would be too huge for me, would take a long time to cook, and my leftovers would have to sit in the car all day. I ALWAYS order the apple pancakes. They are my favorite. I just love them. Even if they take 30-45 minutes to bake and are humungous. Imagine sauteed apples with a pancake/cake batter poured on it with lots of cinnamon, baked in the oven. Yes, its sooo good. Usually. I was quite happy to see that they had a option of a Junior apple pancake, smaller version of the same goodness I usually like. They should all do this.  SG ordered a regular egg dish, which also comes with some pancakes.   After about 45 minutes, my pancake arrives. BURNT! So, if I had gotten it about 5 minutes earlier, it would have been perfect? Ironic. I thought it would be ok, but I could not eat the charred edges, they just were too burnt. Steve's meal took another  5 minute to come. My meal is the one that takes forever and then its like they forget the other order. I noticed this at the neighboring table and blew it off until it happened to us. They need to time things better. My food would have been cold if I was polite enough to wait.  Our service was also pitiful. I had to get up and get the syrup from the bus station myself. Coffee refills were few and far between too. But, we were headed to a ball game, so we probably did not want to have too much coffee on board. I did notice the service at the neighboring tables with a different waitress appeared to be much better than ours, but I can only rate our experience.   We will likely not be back here. There are lots of breakfast options elsewhere and I can save my Apple pancake as a treat for Socal."}
{"text":"I just had a pecan waffle a few days ago and it was to die for!!!!!!!  The waffle was sweet and the texture was what you should expect when getting a waffle. It was crunchy on the outside but nice and tender inside. I was given a citrus sauce to put on the waffle but I was not a fan.  Thanks, but I will stick with MAPLE!  I usually get the cheese steak omelette and if you are looking for meat and cheese in the morning then the omelette is your go to source.  LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"IHOP it's not, not even close. It's fine, but very expensive. I got Swedish pancakes, $9 FOR PANCAKES....and that includes nothing else. I got a plate of crepe-type pancakes that covered the plate with crispy edges. I lathered on the lingonberries, which is what makes it Swedish, folded, then proceeded to take bite out of COLD PANCAKES. It seems they don't bother to heat the ICE COLD fruit compote. I questioned the waitress and she said I had to ask for them heated....she was willing to nuke if for me after the fact, uh no. I would have preferred she asked me ahead of time, or just nuke the fruit before serving. I also got country fried potatoes ($3 for the potato side, ouch,) but the best buck I spent was adding cheese and bacon to the potatoes. At those prices I won't be back anytime soon. Just beware, if you want something with fruit....I recommend asking them to HEAT THE FRUIT...or plan on eating cold pancakes."}
{"text":"The apple pancake is the best!!!  When ever the cravings hit, it never disappoints!  Soo delicious!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, are here on Father's Day and had a 40 minute wait.  Best eggs I've had in a long time...and my kids loved the pancakes.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The name \"Original Pancake House\" suggests that it's a pancake house. That is correct. I think you would be remiss to come here for anything besides pancakes, although they do a few other things besides pancakes here. Are they good? Yes, more or less. Are they better than what the ordinary American can make at home? Maybe. Their pancakes are pretty big and fluffy and good, and at least coming here means no dishes to do at home. But I was not blown away by the food or anything else. When I came, there was a massive line outside. Luckily I was a party of one, so I could slip in and get a seat at the counter, but best of luck to you if you're a party of two or more people. The place dresses itself as a diner of breakfasts, although I was disappointed at what I felt was a somewhat short menu. I got three pancakes with eggs (I did over easy) and a sausage patty. They were OK. That is how they were neither offensive nor remarkable enough that \"OK\" is all I can garner to describe them. And for pancakes, this place is not cheap. Finally, it took them a while for them to get my check.  Yelp defines three stars as \"A-OK\". That is exactly how I would describe this establishment. A-OK doesn't mean that this place is bad, it just means that I won't be regaling my friends about the meals here. A-OK is something that you do when, with three kids in the back of the minivan after soccer practice, you and your spouse want to go somewhere where the kids can have a simple and yummy meal without fuss. In my book, IHOP is A-OK. Target is A-OK. Feel free to judge this place as you wish, but I give it a solid \"Neutral\"."}
{"text":"Apple pancake, Rons Southwest Eggs, and the 49ers. Done deal. I've been coming here since I was a little girl and I have no idea WHY this place doesn't have 5 stars!! Ron is so personable, he's here 7 days a week from open to close and the food is total comfort food. There is so much competition with breakfast places but this is totally 100% the best, the food is so flavorful!! No brainer, come here for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my family yesterday and immediately we felt a warm welcome by the Hostess Carmella.  I'm big on greetings when I enter a restaurant I've never been to and she was great.  Very helpful, and also very knowledgeable of there menu. She gave me and my fiance great recommendations (Dutch baby, Apple Pancake) and was exactly what we were in the mood for. Our servers name was Jesse who was also really good.  Im just writing this in hopes that management sees this because I had no time to talk to a manager while we were there to let them know that they have a truly genuine staff especially Carmella and please keep doing what your doing!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! Potato pancakes are perfect: thin, crisp with lacy edges. Service was fantastic. Brian, our server was flawless, and remembered all of our requests.  Only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars: the poached eggs on the eggs benedict were slightly overdone. I prefer the yolks to be runny; ours were more like soft-cooked.  Otherwise, I would recommend this location."}
{"text":"Walked in 45 minutes before they closed. Never felt rushed at all. Everyone was friendly to the point that I felt like a regular at the corner diner. I couldn't decide what to have and was told that it was no problem to customize my order. I got the corned beef hash with eggs. For a little more I got the bacon pancakes instead of plain ones. Lordy, I was a happy woman!  The hash was made in house, and some of the best I've ever had. A little salty, but in a good way. My eggs were cooked PERFECTLY! Basted medium. Whites cooked, yolk making a nice runny sauce for the hash. Ketchup and hot sauce were available, but not needed.  Those bacon studded pancakes were CRAZY good. If you like the balance between sweet and salty, fluffy and crunchy, you will love these.  Hubby ordered some crepes with strawberries. He loved them and offered me a bite. I couldn't break away from my plate to try them. I am sorry/not sorry."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent server and quick. Loved using yelp to get on wait list.  Had blueberry pancakes they were amazing would highly recommend and will be back again"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! We have been multiple times and I swear it just gets better with each visit. Our last visit was during a busy Sunday around brunch time. They had a packed house but our wait for seats was literally only about 5-10 minutes. They are really quick at getting people in and out. It helps that you don't have to wait for the waiter to bring your card/money back; you just walk up to the front register and pay there.  The food is amazing. Eggs Michael, Eggs Benedict, Blueberry pancakes, literally everything we've tried has yet to let us down. The bacon is AMAZING - thick cut Canadian bacon. They know just how to cook it! The blueberry pancakes come with blueberry compote which is SO good - and the portion sizes are amazing. 6 pancakes for less than 6 bucks! Their omelets are $12 but don't let the price fool you, they are HUGE!   The entire wait staff is fast, efficient and friendly. During our last visit, Charlette was our waitress and she was SO sweet and quick. The girls at the front door and at the register are always great, as well!  Awesome place, awesome food, awesome staff!"}
{"text":"Now I know.  I didn't realize this was a chain.  After we left my husband said \"I was wondering why you wanted to go to an \"IHOP\".\"    For what it is it was fine; nothing special typical breakfast food.  I had the eggs Benedict; eggs had runny whites, hollandaise was oily (like it sat in the window for a bit),  bacon was nice and thick though.  Nick had the apple waffle.  Much better than mine; so I finished it for him.  Service was good.  Sorry, but I probably wont be back. Still looking for my holy grail breakfast place."}
{"text":"This Original Pancake House is definitely OG! I love the classic diner feels I get when we take our seat at the counter top. The servers here are very attentive and sweet. Coffee could be stronger but it's still very good.  The offer daily specials and of course a variety of fluffy pancakes to choose from. My favorite is the German and the blueberry cakes.  If you're ever in Scottsdale and you're looking for a solid breakfast spot without an overwhelming menu or location then I recommend this spot!  4 stars for being better than most pancake houses I've been to. It's on the favored list."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast with my cousin an the service an food were great. I had blueberry pancakes and eggs, bacon an hash browns an it was all cooked perfectly. Loved the blueberry compote on the side. I also love how it wasn't that busy an we were seated right away. Usually it's a wait especially on the weekends. So I will definitely be back. Want to try the German pancakes..."}
{"text":"Side of bacon - good.  Pancakes - total trash.  Eggs - nothing special.  Sausage links - old and soft. Sausage patties - lacked flavor.  Omelette - overcooked with a hard exterior. Yes hard.   Do not come here."}
{"text":"Worth the wait!  The oven pancakes are beyond description.  Comfortable , great staff!"}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST PLACE IN MADISON! (either location: Monona & University)!!! I have eaten here over 20 times and never been disappointed. Their pancakes, omelettes... really everything... is amazing! If you come in on a weekend be prepared to have a 15-25 minutes (though my waits may be longer than most people dinning here because I request my waiter). Typically my boyfriend and I order an omelette and share it because it also comes with 3 pancakes. The omelets consist of 4 eggs and A LOT of cheese! I'm telling you these are the biggest omelets you'll ever see. The pancakes that come with are of good size too and we always add whipped cream and strawberries to our order. Their whipped cream is amazing and home made every morning. This meal usually costs us about ~$9-10 dollars and we are both stuffed after.   You have to try this place their food is delicious.  Be prepared to pay with cash or check only!"}
{"text":"Service and food was very good for an early Saturday morning.    I ordered the blueberry pancakes that came with real blueberries, powdered sugar, and an orange juice.  The orange juice is freshly squeezed and was very pulpy and frothy.  You could taste the \"real\" little orange flakes from the actual fruit.  My friend had the Swedish pancakes and it was more like a crepe, also excellent.  Overall the food got here quick, tasted good, and I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Warning - Cash only restaurant!  I took my family of 4 (including two kids) here for the first time last Saturday. We were all in the mood for some good pancakes and French toast. I am glad we picked this restaurant to eat at! We got to the restaurant around 11am, and had a small wait. Per other reviews sounds like the wait can get long, so we must have gotten lucky.   We were seated and asked by the hostess what we would like for drinks. I like that they were quick with service for how busy they were. The menu was large with I don't recall how many different types of pancakes they offer, but it was A LOT. All of them had me drooling and it was hard to pick just one. I was also impressed with the large kids menu for picky eaters.   I ordered their apple pancakes which said takes longer. What arrived was HUGE and not at all what I expected. But to my surprise it was delicious, just don't expect your typical pancakes. It was seriously like the size of a LARGE apple pie.   All in all everyone finished their food besides me, because frankly what I ordered could feed a family of 4! The table next to me ordered the same thing to share."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we found this one on Yelp. Visiting from Chicago we were trying to find something familiar to us. This place is way better than the one in IL. Super friendly service and quick. Great place for small or big families. The parking lot is not large but not impossible to get a spot. It was a little confusing getting in because of Google map directions but we figured it out. Other than that prices were fair for quantity of food."}
{"text":"Awesome!  I love potato pancakes.  They are excellent here.  When we visited here, among other things, we got the Bacon Lover's Special.  We must have gotten half a pound of bacon!  We ended up sharing with the \"older\" couple next to us, who commented on how much bacon came to the table.    Mostly locals at this joint, since it's way off the strip.  My 'original' favorite was the OPH at Green Valley Ranch in Henderson  (see: http://www.yelp.com/biz/p7RWwyP49cDwgvoK1Um8Mg?hrid=JAjv8kjm89V08MGTqmb97Q ) but the lines are insane there and it' doesn't make much sense to drive all the way out there when my family is near Summerlin.  Thank goodness theres an excellent OPH in this part of town."}
{"text":"Great for thier buttermilk pancakes...mmm delicious. Very nice home style breakfast all the way to the hot chocolate with the thick cream to top it off. Omletts are good, fluffy and fill just right. Great service and friendly atmosphere. One small clinch....NO CELL PHONE USE...ugh, but with great food and company who needs to chat or text."}
{"text":"Very retro cool dive vibe to it. Waiting in line for breakfast on a Wednesday morning. Pretty clean for an older place. Not cheap. The food is beautiful! The cheese bacon grits are the best grits I've ever had and I live in the south!"}
{"text":"We came over to this place because it was showing at the #1 ranking on TripAdvisor for Charlotte. I think that is extremely overrated. The food is not even that great, we had better food at IHOP ! The restaurant does not takes reservations and it is extremely busy. Parking lot has not enough spaces and there isn't any alternatives to park nearby.  The best thing of this restaurant was the fresh squeezed orange juice, everything else, you get much better anywhere else."}
{"text":"I am a huge OPH fan from way back, except I had always gone to the one in Laguna Niguel, CA.  When I saw this location as I was driving by one day, I had to turn around, pull into the parking lot, and tag it in my GPS so I could easily find it again.  Moving into a new area can be hard, but this was a piece of home that I was thrilled to find.  We showed up on a weekday, around 10.  We still had to wait about 10 minutes or so, which wouldn't have been so bad except there is no warm place to do it!  They have a little anteroom, but it is devoid of even a basic space heater.  When we were seated, I was happy to find that the tables were spaced out a little more (in CA, you are close enough to taste the food at the table next to you).  Decor pretty much consisted of blown-up posters of the menu fare.  The menu is pretty much the same, except CHEAPER (WH!!!).  This required me to get the baked apple pancake.  For years, I have been visiting OPH, and trying to get other items, except I almost always have the same thing.  Maybe I should call it the apple CRACKcake, because it's so addictive!  One of these days, I'm going to have to trick myself into getting something different by making my husband order while I run to the car or something, lol.  One menu item that I hadn't seen before was some sort of tropical chicken and fruit salad, prominently displayed in one of the aforementioned posters.  Seriously?  I thought it was a joke when I first saw it.  It is served in a hollowed out pineapple, with a banana sticking out of one end, in order to build some sort of \"fruit bird\".  The thing looks like a reject from 1950's era polynesian theme restaurants.  I'm guessing even Don Ho would have thought this thing kitschy, lol.  In any case, the apple pancake (and dh's cheese steak omelette) arrived.  I WAS a little disappointed, because THIS apple pancake was drowning in grease!  Normally I would have sent it back, but by this time we had struck up a conversation with the guy at the next table, and were thoroughly enjoying ourselves with that.  On a 2nd visit, the grease was thankfully absent, so I will have to see if they are inconsistent, or that was just an anomaly.  DH's cheese steak omelette ROCKED!  It had big chunks of meat that were tender and flavorful.  The omelettes are smaller than in CA, but still WAY huge (and did I mention cheaper?)  I will definitely make the OPH a go-to place for breakfast, if only to point and snicker at the scary bird salad.  ;)"}
{"text":"Great food friendly prompt service. We got there at 8 a.m. on a Sunday if you're going to go, go early the place packed out so be prepared to wait if you're not an early bird definitely going again and again and again. The omelets are delicious they are baked so they're more on the healthy side and the pancakes are to die for. You can eat and eat and eat and not feel like a stuffed cow afterwards :-)"}
{"text":"I've been to the other location but never here.  Needless to say, same experience of great food was had.  Love the pancakes but even more so love the omelettes!  I had the western omelet and it was as big as my head!  The key to coming to this place is come hungry but understand that you will NOT eat lunch most likely.  They feed you right.  The service was a bit off the morning I was there but it does get slammed and is a kid friendly place so I am a bit more lenient with the wait staff with that in mind."}
{"text":"Nothing here sucks....nothing.  Ok, maybe the fact that it's gonna be packed but they do a good job churning the patrons in and out so it doesn't really suck too bad.  Just recently visited with my girlfriend and friends and one person there tried an oven baked pancake and I swear it was the size of a tire and nearly as thick.  I don't know how but he put it all away!  It looked delicious and it was a custom order so if you go and you want some additional ingredients in your pancake, don't be afraid to ask.  Aside from that, my meal was great (actually had a turkey club) and everyone let more than satisfied.  Be warned though, the menu can be a bit overwhelming....there are SO many great items to choose from!"}
{"text":"30 min wait seems to be the standard reply while you wait to have breakfast at the original pancake house.  At first I thought it just lack of training and I was hoping it would be worth in at 8:30 a.m. on a Sunday morning.    In short, really glad we waited.  One of the best breakfasts I've had on my dozens of visits to Mad City.  The crepes were wonderful as were the eggs and pancakes eaten by others in our party. Plus they have the absolutely BEST bacon - thick, lean and cooked to perfection.  Definitely planning my next visit!!"}
{"text":"Aimlessly driving around, and I stumbled upon this place. I really like the vintage vibes and the staff is super attentive! I had challah French toast and a side of corned beef house. The French toast was fluffy, sweet, and had a crunch that has my mouth watering as I'm writing this review. My boyfriend loved his vegetarian omelette. It was pretty fluffy too since he got it with egg whites. The portions are pretty large and not a long wait on a Saturday morning!"}
{"text":"This place is much better than that other pancake chain, IMO.  What you really want to order is the Swedish pancakes.  They are nice and thin with good texture, and the lingonberry sauce is yummy.  The plate of three is not a super-heavy meal and goes nicely with a side of bacon.  As for the rest of it, well, it's breakfast food classic style.  Not a lot of worldly innovation, but it's all good.  Plus they are open at the crack of dawn."}
{"text":"Definitely the best breakfast place I have tried in all my Madison trips. Friendly staff, very clean and very fresh food. Potato pancakes were perfect and the hollandaise sauce was great. Fast, freshly cooked and coffee never got cold"}
{"text":"If you are going to demand (I'm sure past bad experiences dictated that so OK) payment up front for to go orders then do it all at the cashier. Why would ANYBODY have to: place an order at the bar wait for the ticket go to the cashier and pay Go BACK TO THE BAR Give the ticket so it can FINALLY reach the kitchen  Inefficient is a understatement"}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped here for breakfast prior to a hike at Red Rock Canyon.  I'm glad this was a place we decided to try.    I ordered a small portion of coconut pancakes and my friend ordered a Dutch baby.  My breakfast consisted of 3 pancakes, medium size, and some butter, maple syrup, and tropical fruit syrup.  The pancakes were already dusted with confectioners sugar so I just used a small amount of the tropical fruit syrup.  It was very good and so were the pancakes.  My friend liked his Dutch baby.  He also had two eggs and they were done nicely.  Service was very good.  The server came around a couple of times to give us more coffee or freshen what we had.  She was a very pleasant person besides being very competent.  This is a will  return breakfast place.  Oh, and the hike was just over 6 miles and we survived thanks partially to the good breakfast with which we started!"}
{"text":"Other than the fact that our waitress was  extremely pushy, we fully enjoyed the German Babies.  I suggest you get here early.  Restaurant is small and popular."}
{"text":"Due to business trips I have been able to visit Charlotte more often in the past 2 months and was able to find this gem! I have had the eggs Benedict, corned beef hash, omelette, and their potato pancakes. It's not every day that you can order potato pancakes! I used to eat them growing up so it's definitely a must try for me and they did not disappoint because they were delicious.  The other neat thing is that their corned beef hash is homemade not from the can my friends! So pay a little extra for that premium meat and you won't be sad. All the other dishes were outstanding including the Hollandaise sauce for the eggs Benedict.    Overall, we have been back here every single trip for breakfast so we are loving it!"}
{"text":"My parents live less than a mile from this place, and whenever we visit (from Norcal) we make it a point to eat here -- and we've never been disappointed.  If you are used to the tasteless mush they serve at IHOP or Denny's you will be pleasantly surprised.  I'm rather partial to the buckweat pancakes or 49er flapjacks, and my wife is crazy for the corned beef hash, which is homemade and nothing like the stuff that comes from a can (and is what you usually find in restaurants.)  One word of caution:  the omelets are way too much for one person (especially since they come with pancakes) unless you are either incredibly hungry or rather porky, so we normally split one between two people.    Otherwise, nothing to complain about -- good food and good service.  If you come on the weekends, either come in really early or late (i.e. after 10am) if you want to avoid a rather lengthy wait.  I've eaten at a number of OPHs (including Glenview Illinois, Cupertino CA, Anaheim CA, and Los Altos CA) and this one is by far my favorite.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love pancakes and i really love pumpkin pancakes - but  i didnt love the ones they served me. dry flavorless (no pumpkin - just hint of pie spice)  whipped creamed, and overpriced - reminded me of some canned ayce buffet style casserole  sweet potato dish. sad to say but perkins up the road kicks their ass in cakes dept."}
{"text":"Freshly squeezed grapefruit juice and hot coffee were a great start to the meal. I ordered the Corned Beef Hash, which was flavorful and had a perfect balance of onions, potatoes, and corned beef, and was accompanied by 2 eggs and 4 potato pancakes (which are basically latkes!).   The meal was great, and I would definitely go again for the delicious food (five stars!), but I felt a little miffed by the end of the meal, as the waitress basically ignored me from the second half of the meal onward. My coffee was not refilled, I wasn't asked if I wanted dessert, and the waitress basically threw down my receipt on the table and went to look after other customers. I tried to get her attention several times, and she ignored me. I went on a Tuesday at noon: the entire restaurant was practically empty. I had been thinking about ordering an apple pancake for dessert, but with that kind of treatment, no thank you.   Great meal, but service was only so-so."}
{"text":"I came here for the apple pancakes everyone was raving about.   They are good, I will readily admit that. For about $12 bucks a large, an approximately 1 foot diameter pancake covered with warm granny smith apples and drowning in cinnamon syrup is placed in front of you. The pancake itself is dense and moist, some areas have a crispy crust due to how it is prepared. It is still hot when served so you do have to be careful when eating. If I had to nitpick their signature dish, I think it would have been better with the syrup on the side, so if you didn't want it so sweet you just use a little less syrup.  The service is what brought the rating down. Although my server was great, the hostess and cashier were definitely not happy to be there. When I first walked into the restaurant, the glare the cashier gave me knocked my back a bit. No greeting, just a stink eye. Then the hostess walks over, I guess she was mad I made her work since I didn't get a greeting from her either. Even though there were plenty of tables and booths available, she seated me in the middle of the room.   If you are craving a specialty pancake, like german or apple, then definitely give the pancake house a try. Just be prepared to suffer the wrath of the cashier and hostess. If you are just craving plain pancakes or other breakfast fare then there are many places with friendlier greeters than here."}
{"text":"I like the pancake house pretty well.  It's a bit over priced and the decor could use an update. Omlet lovers will enjoy the egg options. Gluten free batter is available but if you're celiac remember how much other flour is around a pancake place.  Cross contamination is pretty much inevitable."}
{"text":"Primm location not recommended. Over priced and tasteless. Also, the waiter presumably tried to impress us by not writing down our order on a ticket and just used his memory. No surprise,he got two of our orders wrong."}
{"text":"This place is my weekend heaven and really love their Garden Benedict ;)) They are pretty busy whenever I get there but who cares as long as you have delicious food in your stomach at the end right?"}
{"text":"The food and service were great, if you want a good breakfast with thick bacon this is the place."}
{"text":"The food is good here but the orange juice is a rip off & they charge you per cup! Not only do they charge you per cup, if you order OJ with a kids meal (which drinks are included) they charge you for an adult glass of orange juice and don't even tell you. It's $5 per cup and you can't order it with a kids meal. Well you can but you pay the full price & then basically waste the included drink that comes with the kids meal. Paid $20 just for orange juice on Mother's Day! Very disappointed that we weren't informed of this up charge or per glass charge. Wasn't until I asked after I received the bill & it was too late by then."}
{"text":"Can I give a zero?  Staying next door to this restaurant.   Certainly plan on going there for breakfast later but walk in to get some to go coffee.  \"Two large coffees to go, please\"  \"That will be $12.  It is double price to go\"  Huh?  I mean, this is no Vemti cappuccino from Starbucks!  More like crap coffee from a 76 station.   Highway robbery."}
{"text":"Original Pancake House used to be my favorite breakfast spot. Ever since my go-to Original Pancake House location by Decatur and Charleston got destroyed by a fire,I have been visiting this location. The quality of their food is going down and I am disappointed with how inconsistent they have been.  AMBIANCE If you were lucky enough to have visited the other location on Decatur before it got destroyed, you know how great the ambiance was. It was much spacious and multiple windows that brought all the sunlight in made it a perfect spot to enjoy your warm and fluffy pancakes.  This location is complete opposite. It is crowded and super loud. I feel like there's too many people in there...not enough oxygen. I feel sick and overwhelmed when I'm here.  SERVICE Typically quick and friendly. There is one server named Jesse who is my absolute favorite server. He has the best smile that is brighter than a sunshine and I always feel welcomed there whenever I see him.  FOOD It has definitely gone downhill. My usual is there chocolate crepe. It's a crepe with chocolate cream inside, topped with chocolate sauce, fresh whipped cream and fruits which changes with season. It's usually strawberry because they stock so much of strawberry but I've gotten bananas few times.   I noticed this place is very inconsistent. Sometimes my chocolate crepe comes out perfect as it could be, at times it is soggy like it was drenched in water. On my recent visit, it was cold and dry. Please, Original Pancake House, get it together.  My family always gets their pancake and they claim the pancake here has gotten dry and not as good as it used to be. Disappointment is real.   CONCLUSION They do have rushes but usually quick to get you to a table. Food has gone downhill but reasonable price and attentive servers. I recommend Jamms Restaurant over this place."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast brunch spot. Great service and excellent food. Allow yourself a little bit of time and belly room and treat yourself to a Dutch baby."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I started with a bowl of fruit. It was freshly cut, cold, and really good, not all cantaloupe. The menu is huge so if you don't find a something you like you shouldn't have come to a breakfast place.The hash was a bit disappointing with too much greasy corned beef for what I expected in home made. The German pancakes served with it were amazing. We were seated by the kitchen so had the opportunity to see other dishes coming out. Lots of wonderful looking items. I'll try the Dutch apple souffle next time. It's their signature dish and looked terrific. Matt had a more traditional Canadian bacon and eggs with a side of pancakes. He cleaned the plates and left with a smile. Breakfast for two was about $40. A, a little much but we both added side items. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and will be  return."}
{"text":"I don't find myself in this area often but when I do I like to drop in at OPH. My usual haunts are Stack's & Charlotte Cafe where 2 eggs, bacon, hash browns & java are priced in the $6-7 range. Being a firm believer in value I can honestly say that all three deliver. OPH bacon is thick cut, well smoked & ample, 4 slices versus 3. Their coffee is a far superior blend as is their buttermilk pancake blend. Service is A+ at all three. Occasionally, having spent 23+ years in the coffee trade, I'll order a French Press at OPH and really bump my day over the top."}
{"text":"Me and the girlfriend came here for an anniversary breakfast! It was amazing! Strongly recommend the strawberry pancakes!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating here. The food was great. I had the strawberry French toast with eggs over medium came out with fresh strawberries and strawberry syrup soo delicious also my eggs were perfect. As for my husband he had the steak and cheese omelet it was so fluffy and filled with shaved steak and veggies I recommend it. The reason for my 4 stars was because our server seemed to have an off day. She was rude and then had the Odasity to be friendly to the table next to is, she didn't even check on us got my drink order wrong and when I asked about items she gave me cold answers, when I come back I hope I don't have her again thank god the food was good enough to overlook her horrible service"}
{"text":"This place has all the elements you'd expect would make a wonderful establishment, but somehow it falls short.  First, the menu is expansive. Anything you could ever imagine you'd like from a place with \"pancakes\" in the name, plus specials. There are dozens of planned dishes, but if none of those make your skirt fly up, you can create your own breakfast from the menu of side dishes.   The service is great, but also along the lines of what you'd expect from a diner. There's no way you're eating here without some sort of endearing acknowledgement -- our server called every female \"young lady.\"   There's no ambiance here -- none. The high ceilings make it feel very industrial, and the fluorescent lights give the place a clinical vibe. I wouldn't dare complain about that, though; if the food is great, I'll eat it in a shack. The food is always the most important part.  The food, though, is disappointing. I ordered a simple midday breakfast of corned beef hash and eggs with a side of grits and not one part of my meal was worth writing home about. My \"over medium\" eggs were far undercooked. Not just runny whites, either -- I'm talking about whites that were still clear and snotty. As in completely raw. My corned beef hash was cold and unproportionally heavy on the onion. And my grits were flavorless, even after adding whipped butter I stole from my companion's french toast.  I know, I know, breakfast isn't supposed to be five star, chef-inspired cuisine. But if I'm ordering eggs (and paying $10), I expect them to be, you know, cooked. My bar is set very low, and OPH couldn't reach it."}
{"text":"Fresh squeezed grape fruit juice, amazing!  Buck wheat pancakes.  I was in Charlotte for business and needed a good breakfast and place to check email.  I noticed it was crowded and gave it a shot.  So glad I did.  The food was fast, service courteous and price fair.  I recommend this place.  There's something for everyone and it won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch/breakfast and thought the place was great! What a nice, unpretentious little breakfast spot in Charlotte. They have all sorts of different pancakes, so if you are in the mood for pancakes, its the perfect spot to go. The inside is pretty bare ambiance wise, but its ideal for a casual pancake breakfast out !"}
{"text":"Great service and food. The egg benedict is a must try! Food is kind of overpriced for a breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I came here because of close proximity to my house and great reviews. However, I wasn't impressed. I would think that with the restaurant having \"pancakes\" in their restaurant name that the pancakes would at least be the best item. The pancakes to me tasted like flour. I also ordered the vegetarian omelette which was different in texture than what I was used too, but did the job in satisfying my breakfast craving. It wasn't anything impressive. However, the pricing is great and my waitress was accommodating. Unfortunately, that was not enough to continue my business with this establishment."}
{"text":"Where do I even start?! This is my go to place for breakfast in Charlotte. I've even came here for lunch when I worked in South Park. It's the bomb. My favorite is the egg combo with turkey bacon and buckwheat pancakes. Don't forget the strawberry or Apple syrup depends on what mood I'm in. We keep saying we're going to try the apple pancake. But it's so huge. I'm scared lol. Go here! It's my favorite and will be yours too. It's one of those places where you become a regular and don't need a menu to order after a few trips."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in CU! Veggie scramble is delicious, eggs, cheese, tomatoes, and mushrooms all scrambled together and so so good! 49er pancakes are amazing, thin gooey pancakes that are light and tasty, however you must try the apple pancake if you haven't yet- it is to die for! I'm not a huge apple pie or baked apple person but this thing is so so good! Chocolate chip pancakes, blueberry pancakes, any kind of pancakes are all good here too. I hear the coffee is awesome but I'm not a coffee drinker so I don't know"}
{"text":"Well... at least the coffee was good.  Greetings, fellow Yelpers! Despite the previous and rather good reviews, I cannot report the same. I arrived 30min after opening, and the meal was a disappointment. Hollandaise was anything but fresh made. It had that \"sat in the fridge all night\" look to it. Dull sheen and stiff but not broken/overcooked. Just not quite right. Bland, flavorless yellow muck. The potato pancakes were the real horror story. Whatever they used on the flat top was rancid. Completely inedible. Caveat Emptor, my friends! As for me, I'll not be back."}
{"text":"This place does breakfast/brunch right! I ordered up the bacon lover's breakfast which included 5 strips of bacon, home fries, 3 eggs, and pancakes. Talk about stuffed! No one in my party was able to eat it all. I substituted the pancakes for banana nut pancakes and they were the star of the show- so good!   I deducted 1 star because parking is kind of difficult on busy days. Also, while there were a lot of options on the menu, there weren't many \"combinations.\" So you have to order things separate, which can really add up. I wouldn't call this place a bargain. That's why I ended up ordering the bacon lover's breakfast. However, even though I love bacon, I didn't need that much bacon."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for breakfast.  Corned beef hash & eggs &  fresh squeezed OK.  What a great way to start the day!  The Dutch Pancakes &  Banana Pancakes  were also really good.  Our waiter was very attentive &  pro-active.  10 minute wait on a Friday morning.  Watch out...  people try to jump the line by taking your name.  It's happened twice here."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab breakfast my family ani love to go here in the mornings. The food is always great no matter what you have and the staff is always willing to go the extra mile for you."}
{"text":"Pulled in on a whim...was heading for Einstein's bagels, but this place looked intriguing.  Large, bright warehouse/loft effect inside. Menu posted in lobby for convenience. Walls painted a pale lemon color, kitchen semi-open to the public. Friendly waitress (I ordered the coffee in spite of myself--trying to cut down--because she was so nice).  I ordered a plain waffle for the daughter and the sourdough french toast for me (we shared with each other, though).  She was given crayons and a kids' menu.  OH. Ingredients do make such a difference. According to the menu,   \"Our recipes demand only the very finest of ingredients, such as 93 score butter, pure 36% whipping cream, fresh grade AA eggs, hard wheat unbleached flour, and our own recipe sourdough starter. Our batters and sauces are made fresh in each restaurant's kitchen.\"  The flavor of the French was subtle and excellent.  The waitress said it was the almond (extract?).  I didn't realize until she said it, but that was what I was tasting (and I am not usually a fan of almond flavoring--that's how gently-flavored it was).  The texture was perfect--just enough resistance and softness in balance.   Sprinkled with powdered sugar, spread with butter, and anointed with warm syrup---I never clear my plate (portion control), but I cleared my plate (with my daughter's help).  The waffle my daughter had was thin and crispy. She liked it. She finished it. I tasted it. It was fine, but after my French toast, I wasn't having it.   The coffee I gave in and had was hot and aromatic. I think it was pretty expensive, though. Like twice as much as a tall cup of Sbux for less the coffee.   I was there around noon on a weekday. It was comfortably occupied, but not crowded. I have the feeling that it can get pretty crazy in the mornings, based on a sign in the lobby about waiting in line.   Definitely beats IHOP (duh). :-)"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT food! Nice Manager. SUPER RUDE waiter.  Our Waiter was complaining about us to the other waitstaff cos we asked someone else to bring us water, when it hadn't come yet.  He then proceeded to keep bringing us waters, and asking us if we wanted more water, to insult us.  Sorry if my spouse needed water to take his medication!  Find a new profession if u r that thin skinned - u punk.  We tipped the little jerk well, and didn't tell his boss.  He's lucky!  People like him, are NOT worth it.    FOOD WAS GREAT!  Go there!"}
{"text":"GREAT food!  SUPER RUDE staff.  Haven't been back in over a year - and counting!  You're not the ONLY OPH around.  Waitress told us they couldn't put the berries on the side, we don't do it that way.  Ordered crepe plain.  Got it w/the berries inside anyway.  Crazy waitress pitched a fit when we said it was wrong.  What a scene.  We just wanted to eat, not visit an insane assylum! Manager tried to diffuse situation, how about, fire the off-center rude waitress?  And what IF we were wrong/is that how u treat customers? Guess so!  Everyone enjoy your experience! LOL!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic dive. Great corned beef hash and delicious pancakes.  Interior is not updated but the good food, hot coffee, and friendly waitstaff make up for it. Food came out really quick. Going to try the apple pancakes next time because they looked awesome!   Cash only and yes they have an ATM.. no cell phones which was kinda nice"}
{"text":"My mom and I visited the Pancake House while visiting Charlotte from New Jersey today.  We truly were in seventh heaven with our food!  We ordered pancakes bacon and sausage links that were so tasty and yummy.  We needed a good meal before heading home & this hit the spot.  The staff is also very kind and professional, true southern hospitality!  Do order the Georgia pecan pancakes, they are amazing!  We will understand why there are crowds waiting to go in to eat."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!! This was my very first time eating here so I had high expectations. I ordered the fresh strawberry pancakes with eggs and thick sliced bacon. I substituted the eggs for grits because I don't like restaurant eggs unless it's omelet style. The pancakes were VERY good and fluffy and has a quality taste to it unlike ihop where to me the pancakes just aren't great. They also use REAL strawberries (not that ihop preserve strawberries). One thing I did not like and I found out when I got my bill was the added strawberries were apparently $2.75 which is ridiculous to me. The grits were nothing special, the bacon was perfect. My little sister got the 3 pigs in a blanket and those were pretty good also.   On Sunday's expect a wait time of about 15-20 min since they close at 3 and everyone is leaving church. But once seated the food came fairly fast. Also finding a parking space can be hard. I'll definitely be coming back here again to try a different platter though!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing about OPH - I love it and I hate it.  Let's start with why I hate it. 1. There is always a long wait and they have a tiny waiting area so you end up waiting outside in the heat. 2. They only take cash. I'm a debit card kinda girl. 3. The staff is not very friendly and they do not accommodate special orders - they may have blueberry pancakes and banana pancakes on the menu but if you want blueberry-banana pancakes you're outta luck. 4. It never seems very clean. 5. It's overpriced.  So why do I keep going back? 1. The food. They have really good pancakes.  Damn it."}
{"text":"Good food - good service even when crowded - when Homeland was filming in Charlotte - the cast was always there for Sunday brunch-- every Sunday for one whole month I went after church to see who would be there -  Morena Baccarin - Brody's wife - David Harewood - FBI director and a few others - food is good - loved the omelettes and the apple pancake"}
{"text":"Oh how I have loved this place for so many years -- since it was located right next to Hilldale.  A great, affordable breakfast (If you like greasy spoon -- which I do). It can be a pain to wait for on the weekends, to be sure.  But I swear, I have never had better chocolate chip pancakes yet.  And the strawberries and creme are excellent when in season."}
{"text":"When a dear friend suggests that we meet for breakfast at the Original Pancake House, I always jump at the chance.  Going during a weekday gives us a chance to relax, since there's not too many tables filled.  The omelettes there are HUGE! Today, I choose the bacon omelette, which also comes with a short stack of pancakes. I forget how much bacon is in the omelette and ordered a side of bacon. The amount of bacon in the omelette is more than enough, so my side was overkill.  Couldn't finish it all, even though I'm a big eater.  If you're looking to get stuffed while avoiding the buffet, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a Vegas staple. The food is CONSISTENTLY GOOD! And that's saying something. The people who work at OPH have worked there for decades. Again, that says something. I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered from there. Especially the poached eggs. They are perfect. Every time. They also know how to cook bacon. YAY!!! Most places serve it half cooked. Not here, always crispy & perfect. All in all, OPH is a fantastic breakfast spot. This is where a lot of the locals go for breakfast. So good. All the time."}
{"text":"There are few things I enjoy more than getting up early on a Saturday before everyone else and going out for a nice breakfast.  I've been to other locations of Original Pancake House before and have always liked it.  I met a friend from another part of town and this location was about halfway.  I got there early and was greeted promptly and got a booth by a window.  Coffee black is how I started.  My friend arrived and I orders 2 eggs, thick bacon (which is spelled out on the menu) and it came with 3 pancakes.  Eggs were good and to be expected.  Bacon was thick as noted.....nothing worse then going out to breakfast and they serve that paper thin crap.  This bacon was as God intended it.  Pancakes were fluffy, lightly sweet and served with whipped butter I LOVE WHIPPED BUTTER, and good syrup.  For like $8.00 it was all good!!!  This location was excellent and the experience was positive.  Only negative was the parking spots were a bit small but other than that everything was A-OK"}
{"text":"A very diner-y experience. The food is classic American breakfast. They offer a wide range of pancake options and gratuitous portions. It is not possible to leave hungry.  The cakes are fluffy pillows and are complimented by a hefty helping of whipped butter and syrup. However, I would actively steer you away from the Egg's Michael or anything with the mushroom sherry gravy, it tastes a lot like regret.  Overall, a decent place for breakfast. It doesn't make my short list, but is a good option if you are near by. Not necessarily worth a drive across town."}
{"text":"Wow. Avoid this place like the plague.   We were very excited to eat here, so despite us having plans afterwards, we figured we would just show up late. They said 15 - 20 mins wait for a table, not a big deal. 20 mins later we get the worst table in the whole restaurant, not a big deal. We order right away considering we didn't have much time to waste.   20 mins after ordering we noticed a few tables that showed up after us had already recieved their food. 20 mins later we noticed those tables already left and the people who got there after them had already ordered and received their food.   10 mins later I noticed a lady who had showed up about 10 mins ago had already recieved her food which was the same order as ours. At this point we recieved part of one of our orders... The rest of the food is no where in sight.  An hour after we order, we decided that we have to leave because of prior obligations. We complain to the cashier who then starts to rudely tell us food takes time to cook, but then or waitress who sees us leaving comes over and tells the cashier how we had been waiting for an hour for our food and it still hasn't come.   Thank you incompetent cooks, rude cashier, and worthless manager for ruining my day. Our server was alright... She was probably the best part of that catastrophy of a restaurant."}
{"text":"For a place with so many stars on yelp, a hefty line to wait in on the weekend and Pancake in the name I expected this experience to be amazing. Alas, I make better pancakes out of a box at home. The dishes at this restaurant are not original. There are no real healthy food options and the portions are enormous (I'm guessing that's why it's so darn expensive?). It's basically grease, grease, more grease and butter. I'd much rather go to a Le Peep or get reservations at Radio Maria for brunch. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I still love going to OPH. Great service and terrific food. Today was the strawberry blintzes, which are crepes wrapped around a strawberry and custard filling, then topped with strawberry syrup and real (not canned) whipped cream.  You can't go wrong here. Their omelets are baked rather than grilled, which means that they come out tall and fluffy, stuffed with goodness. Or try the Dutch Baby, a huge pancake bowl that needs only lemons and hold the powdered sugar. The pancakes are also rather fluffy and I love the doughyness of them, topped with fresh strawberries and hot syrup.  I see people get the eggs and bacon and I wonder... dude! There is so much more here than the basic over easy and three strips. But it's a free country.  On the weekends, this place is rocking. Expect an hour wait on sunny days."}
{"text":"My first meal when I came to Charlotte was at an OPH, so the chain has a special place in my heart. I've been holding off coming to this one because I didn't want to chance that it would be anything less than the perfect experience it should be. (I'm actually embarrassed that the review of the Southpark location isn't even in my first hundred reviews!) Yes, it's a chain and it's a big one, but other than the heavily laminated menus it could be a one-off. So don't worry about it.  I got here before the breakfast rush started on Saturday morning, but even without a line at the door there was still a full parking lot. (Tip for you folks with full-size Impalas or Expeditions: \"C\" means Compact. So don't park there!). An overflow lot is available across the street. I was fortunate to be seated immediately and at a comfortable booth no less. This gave me a good view of the door so that I could take up the table for a while (until the battery on my laptop ran down) but I knew when it was time to move on.  Pancakes are the main focus of the menu here, with strawberry and pecan and even bacon ones. But I decided to go with my favorite, the \"Eggs Michael.\" Sort of like Eggs Benedict, this is two halves of an English muffin with poached eggs but on top of that is a delish mushroom sherry sauce. Served with four potato pancakes, it's a great treat! I've also had the Dutch Baby many times, but didn't feel like a big carb hit today.  The coffee is excellent  here and it's refilled often.  They do have free wifi (the password today was 'pancakes' but ask the staff if it isn't) and I did not see any freely accessible power outlets.  If you come here for the eggs and bacon, it's great and all that. But really, it's a pancake place. Try them, you'll like them!"}
{"text":"Decent food, GREAT pancakes.  I had the potatoes and eggs (because I just can't have breakfast without potatoes), and they were okay... but the three fluffy buttermilk pancakes that accompany all egg breakfasts were awesome.  I'm usually not a pancake person, but if I come back I will get one of the pancake breakfasts for sure.  And the service was awesome. My server, Beans, or something, according to the ticket, was charming.  Give that girl a raise! My coffee never went empty."}
{"text":"It used to be good but this morning was such a disappointment! I ordered banana crepe, German pancakes and egg Benedict! The egg Benedict was truly disgusting and banana crepe was not good at all. What happened Original Pancake House?? The only I ate was German pan cakes! You really need to step it up! Otherwise you will lose your customers slowly but surely!"}
{"text":"Husband and I couldn't sleep so we decided to check out the Pancake House one morning for breakfast.  We probably should have just stayed in bed!  Ok, ok, it wasn't terrible by any means... but next time, I'll have the hubby cook something up instead.    Hubby had the specialty \"Dutch baby\" thing they have on the menu and it was... interesting.  A really big, thin, lemon-y pancake.  Hubby was born and raised in the Netherlands, and this was just disappointing.  I had eggs and pancakes and they were also very meh.  Very IHOP-ish, like they were microwaved.  Service was friendly and he tried but we were just disappointed.  The restaurant itself is pretty blah, boring, old-looking too.  Save your money and go somewhere better like Hash House A Go Go!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience going to original pancake house!! We got to meet the owner and she was wonderful!! My husband and I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot in Charlotte - be prepared to wait especially on weekends. Their service is great, and prices can't be beaten. Love their potatoes, waffles, fresh squeezed oj, and coffee. They have large omelets and crepes as well. It's no wonder this place is always busy."}
{"text":"When it comes to pancakes it's good to know this joint offers potato cakes and not just wheat and gluten pancakes that you get most everywhere.  I ordered a side of eggs and potato cakes which came with awesome fixings of sour cream and apple jam which made them irresistible. I'm not quiet sure that $8.00 for 8 super thin cakes are worth the price, but still glad I tried them.  The service was rushed and not as friendly as I would of liked and our seating area was dirty. There must have been a spill on the floor around/under our table, because when I got up I was all sticky... Yikes! Over all this place gets 3 stars for good food, but 4 stars will come around when cleanness and customer service improve."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Best breakfast in Charlotte hands down! I've tried many items on the menu like the Dutch baby, omelettes, pancakes, and crepes and I have not been disappointed! Anytime I have friends visiting I ALWAYS recommend Original Pancake House! It is by far my favorite breakfast spot ever! Service is always friendly and accommodating and the food is always excellent! Trust me, just go and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I second Sarah's review. Try the 49er flapjacks and Ron's Special Southwest Eggs (they come with nearly diaphanous potato pancakes). Don't forget to hit the ATM -- there's a Wells Fargo at 68th and Camelback."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went for Breakfast.  We had eggs bacon benedict with potato pancakes and banana pancakes.....................  Delicious...............  Fresh squeezed orange juice, good coffee and good service. Enjoyed it very much."}

{"text":"Decided to have  breakfast there this morning after the positive reviews I read on yelp. The place was half empty when we got there but service was still slow. Ordered rainbow pancakes for my girls, husband had eggs, bacon & hash browns & MIL ordered waffles while I had the Dutch baby.  She told me that the Dutch baby would take approximately 15min & asked if I would want to have all food wait to come out at once & I said no, pls bring out ASAP since my little ones were already hungry & pancakes should be quick to get out. Did she do this? Of course not & we all waited about 20mim for our food.   My husband specifically asked for hash browns but what came out home fries, or more like a breakfast potatoes. When he asked the lady why they weren't hash browns, she proceeded  to argue that in their restaurant, those cut up chunky potatoes were considered hash browns. That went on for a few minutes... Pretty disappointing.... She should've just asked if he wanted something different right away.  Anyways, food was alright... Service was worst. Prob wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"This place is worth the wait!  It was so good that I didn't even take a picture of my food. I had the blueberry waffles which was so-so. The best thing to order is the OMELETS! yes, it's a pancake house but the omelets are mouth-watering. This isn't your typically denny's omelet. Its like a puff pastry filled with gooey melted cheese. Let me tell you, they do not skimp on the cheese. I can't remember the exact omelet he ordered but we had to fight for the last bite. It's large so it can be easily shared between two people."}
{"text":"There's nothing like breakfast at the Original Pancake House! Whether you're in the mood for one of their signature pancake dishes, an omelet, or their unbeatable Belgian waffles, you won't be disappointed. The service is prompt and friendly, the coffee delicious, and the atmosphere lively and fun. The Midtown location in particular, is THE spot to see and BE seen by Charlotte's business and political crowd. Don't waste your time on any of the pale imitations -- when it comes to great pancakes, only the ORIGINAL will do!"}
{"text":"In Scottsdale for a horse show and so excited to have breakfast at our favorite restaurant. Disappointing. No gluten free options. According to the waitress, \"the owner does not believe in gluten free\". They charge $1.50 extra for potatoes when a customer cannot eat the pancakes that come with the meal. So $10.75 for a small omelette. Waitress was snide. Hostess was rude. This particular Original Pancake House does not live up to the standard of the name."}
{"text":"Came here after work for breakfast with a coworker on a Sunday.  Seated immediately, server took our order, food came out very quickly! Love it and will be back!   I ordered the pecan Belgian waffle and sausage links!"}
{"text":"Really good diner food for a great price. It's a small space which completely adds to the charm, but would add to the wait. We arrived at eight on a Sunday without a wait but the hosts were quoting forty five minutes when we were on our way out.   I had a single strawberry crepe and it was more than enough to fill me up, I can't imagine how someone orders three! The crepe was perfectly soft and sweet and served with warm strawberries and syrup which was mostly strawberry puree. Yum! My friend got pancakes with bacon bits in the batter which was an awesome flavor combination for a savory breakfast, she let me share in the bacon feasting thank goodness. I also got to try a bite of corned beef hash which was tasty and also a bit of the Eggs Benedict. I like my English muffin a little toastier, but the hollandaise was yummy enough it didn't matter.  The prices were very reasonable, if not generous to the customers. I would recommend this restaurant to any early bird!"}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday with a friend. And well it was ok. I got the Tahitian crepes and side if Bacon with oj. I loved the juice it tasted so fresh and had just a Lil bit of pulp like I love. Really good. The crepes were OK. And the bacon was decent. Over all it was typical diner food. Honestly this place is really cool simply because of the amazing menu. It's definitely something for everyone on there. It's huge. My guy friends loved the waitress and thought she made the experience. I would go back here. Why not. It's food"}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this restaurant.  So let's start with the positive. There is no better place to get a Dutch Baby pancake.  They are light, lemony and luscious!  They also make a wonderful classic Apple pancake. Both are special orders and take longer to cook, which is well noted on the menu - and worth the wait.   The service is great and attentive. The wait staff and bussers really hustle.  They are always busy and turn over fast without feeling rushed.   Here's my challenge - they are a franchise of the Original Pancake House. So they have the menu, but not the ambiance.  The building is attached to a Motel 6 where my mom worked in the 60's and not much has changed.  It's cramped and a bit dated.   What gets me are the \"rules\" - they are posted everywhere. Minimum 2 people to a booth. No parties will be seated until the entire party is present. Substitutions are priced at ala carte prices - no exceptions.  The hostess is like that grandma that scares the bejesus out of you if you misbehave.  So if you are okay with a lot of rules then this is your place.  Don't ask for any special treatment.    Yet I keep coming back. Love those Dutch Babies!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, a Charlotte main stay has worn out the welcome pad.  My husband took the kids on Sunday and he said \"now I remember, the last time we were here we said we would never go back\".  The meals are over priced and just ok in terms of quality. When my husband spoke to the manager, he could care less about it. (Which is the same thing that happened the last time we were there).  So, to anyone reading this, I would look for another breakfast option."}
{"text":"I visited here for the first time on 5/27, my birthday. I had a pretty good experience, the food was good though the place was a bit Ihop-ish. I thought the name was a bit bold, which I liked. Overall it was a good experience and I would recommend it to those in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Ok, Yes there are lot's of rules, but some of the rules are totally fine in my book.. The no cell phone policy is spot on.. The cash thing sucks.. The wait time is completely out of their hands.. The service is always prompt, and yes if you order anything that is not on your plate(ie:blueberry syrup or peanut butter) you will be charged extra for it. But there is one reason to put up with all of their rules.. And that is in the formation of the 49er flapjacks.. I have mine with syrup and Peanut Butter, and it is the single best breakfast item I have ever put in my mouth, I go to OPH during the week, I never wait, and I bring cash, and life is good... IMO stick to the pancakes.. This isn't Original Omelet House.."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero I would... My family of 7 came in this morning seated within 5 min, served our drinks n then made to wait over 20 while or waiter waited on everyone else but us.. He never took our order... After nearly 30 min we got up and left.. I will never ever visit this establishment again...."}
{"text":"Ok so this was my first time here, it was just my son and I. When I tell you the manager watched me with a smug look on his face. My child was very quiet and respectful. The waitress even commended me on how well behaved he was. The manager acted as if I was going to steal pancakes!!! I asked for him after my meal. I asked him was there any problem??  I told him you watched my 3 year old and I the whole time at least you could of smiled and said hello, as you did with your other customers. Basically he didnt care for my color. I will always kill such ignorance with kindness. I just wanted to make him aware of how uncomfortable he made me feel.  I didnt even eat the food. You cant eat while someone is watching you in that manner.  Still no Hello or smile. My waitress was nice. Food was bland and eggs were burnt."}
{"text":"Only place to eat breakfast in Vegas! Omelets are awesome, as are the pancakes. Great value, quality, and service."}
{"text":"I was craving for some blueberry pancakes big time and the closest place that I knew was the OPH. We came here on a Sunday morning and we had to wait to be seated even though there was open tables, but the wait was only like 10-15 minutes.   We were seated in a cozy booth and I decided to get the ham and eggs and upgrade my pancakes to the blueberry cakes. My husband got the irish omelette. Everything came out fairly quickly and I just have to say that the blueberry pancakes fulfilled my craving.....they had this blueberry compote to put on top instead of syrup and it wasn't overly sweet. My husbands omelette was also really delicious! A HUGE omelette and very cheesy! I love cheese! We left full and satisfied and service was efficient minus the cashier which had a long line.   I will be back for more pancakes for sure! =)"}
{"text":"Tucked in the corner of the crowded lot, looks like your average coffee shop. Not super clean, just above a dive and full of cops.   Not sure what the features something called a Dutch Baby made with dough, powdered sugar and lemon.   A stack of three pancakes came with our meals, my husband had corned beef hash and I had a Western omelet. The pancakes distinctly had the taste of lemon in them and we asked the waitress but she said no way just buttermilk. Nah the lemon was overwhelming so I'm guessing it was remnants from a Dutch Baby. The restaurant isn't allergy friendly and I can see how the cross contamination would be a problem.   The western omelet was the fluffiest biggest omelet I have had and it was thick yet light. So yummy, I ate it all! My husband said the corned beef hash was the best he'd ever eaten.   Skip the coffee. We actually asked for fresh pot because it tasted like black sludge leftover at the days end (we got there at 10am after the morning rush so I can understand old coffee). The so called fresh pot tasted like donkey grease. No way no how. Gross. Don't drink it. It probably was donkey grease or the same cup, I hate asking for something to go back to the kitchen."}
{"text":"You want amazing breakfast? This is the place.  Here's the good: Great food, perfect portions, and awesome unique choices.  Here's the bad: A little pricey, and CASH ONLY?  Cmon people, it's 2009.  I'm not going to repeat what's already been said, but this place is a definite go-to."}
{"text":"I recently went with my two favorite guys to the Original Pancake House on a Sunday morning.   We showed up at around 11am and were able to park without a problem. The parking lot is very small, but on our trip only 3 other cars were there.  We immediately noticed the \"cash only\" sign on the door. What kind of place still takes cash only? Especially in Scottsdale, next to the Fashion center, and it's a place that charges $10 for pancakes????  Fortunately there is a cash machine across the street. Once we got our cash we were able to get a table without waiting. I guess that should have been our clue to what type of food/service we were going to receive.  After looking for over 7 years in Arizona for a breakfast place that serves potato pancakes and dutch pancakes I was pretty excited about trying this place out. The ambiance in this place leaves much to be desired, but I wasn't going to complain if the food was good.  Well, the food and service definitely weren't good..... Our server came to take our order, and it was clear she didn't speak any English. Luckily, one of my guys speaks Spanish and was able to relay our order.   We ordered the Dutch Baby, an order of Potato pancakes, a Cheese omelet, and 3 diet cokes.  I nearly laughed when they brought us 3 cans of soda and a glass of ice cubes. What kind of place doesn't have a soda machine? And secondly, you get no refills. Bad news for someone who drinks 15+ glasses of diet coke while eating out like my friend does! (He makes sure to get his moneys worth!).  We waited nearly an hour for our food. When it finally came it was clear that they had timed our order wrong and put all our food in at the same time. The omelet was ice cold, the pancakes were soggy, the dutch baby was pipping hot. Hmmm..... Our waitress?? No where to be found.  We decided to just eat our food. The omelet was probably the best of what was offered, even though it was ice cold. There was a good amount of cheese, and it was a large portion. It also came with a side of pancakes, which were ok, but really just average pancakes. Not too much different from Denny's. Certainly not what you would expect from a restaurant named \"Original Pancake House\".  The potato pancakes were dismal. Soggy, sad, little things that made me nearly cry for my old Minnesota breakfast hangouts. The applesauce was muscleman's brand, which seemed to cheapen the pancakes even more.  The dutch baby, which I had been so excited about was an eggy mess. Dutch pancakes are usually served while still puffy, this one had fell flat 5 minutes ago. It said on the menu it would come with a lemon butter side. I was served butter in a dish and a slice of lemon. Very disappointing.  Over all, the breakfast wasn't bad. It wasn't good. It was just ok. I realize my expectations were very high. I wouldn't go again, and I wouldn't recommend it. I guess if you are staying at the attached Motel 6 it would probably be a good choice for a quick, filling meal.  If you are looking for a better quality breakfast I would recommend Butterfield's. More ambiance, much better food, the take credit cards, and the prices are much more reasonable."}
{"text":"Here is another MUST GO TO everytime I'm in Vegas... EXCELANTE!!  Great service, delishious pancakes and the best place to hit after a night of partying... It's always packed so you might have to wait a bit but it's well worth it... I've never had to wait more than 15mins...   I always get the pancakes... the batter they use is soo yummy!! You eat every last bite cuz you just cant stop the goodness!  Friends of mine got the baked omelets and they were humongous!!  Way more than enough for two people!! Crepes were also sweet and perfect!  If you love breakfast, You'll LOVE the Pancake house!!"}
{"text":"Our waitress Debbie was so nice and the food was GREAT. Quick service, great tasting food and friendly staff"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a better review...but compared to the one near Gross Pointe, MI- the AZ location is not living up to it's full potential. The omelets are half the size, the rules restrict any creative freedom you like to take with your food, and the service was cold and lacking. It was still a good breakfast, but the one in Michigan is the type of breakfast you dream about."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the veggie omelet, 3 pancakes w turkey bacon.  Boo had Bacon lovers breakfast which includes SEVEN  thick pieces of bacan, eggs, hashbrowns for an upcharge. Sitting was quick, service was excellent. Server kept coffee cup filled and all other requests. Will return to try creapes or the variety of pancakes."}
{"text":"Well, any place that offers more than 10 different pancake offerings on their menu has a special place in my heart...err, or my belly, rather.  I've been to this place four times, and I've tried different pancakes each time.  Only one, thus far, has disappointed me, although I think they may have brought us the wrong pancakes.  I have to say, I especially love the yeasty old buckwheat pancakes (which I'm still not entirely convinced you should put the words \"yeasty\" and \"old\" next to each other on a food menu) and the sourdough pancakes.  Their regular coffee is just ok (pretty standard diner-style), but they do offer french press coffee there (I've not tried it, but one of these days I will).  Their egg and side offers are pretty generous as well.  More food for a better price than IHOP or Waffle House, I think.  This is my favorite breakfast place...or anytime I want breakfast-for-lunch or for-dinner place!"}
{"text":"Love the Dutch babies !  We have had great service every time we have come in.  Love the selection of pancakes and crepes.   It gets QUITE busy on Saturday and Sunday's if you can go on a weekday and not really a long wait which is great and the parking lot is pretty big to find a good space to park.  The portion size is wonderful I normally have left overs I take and have for lunch later, yum!   Give it a try and enjoy the yumminess!"}
{"text":"Pro: waffles Cons: cash only, slow staff, unprofessional environment, horrible cooking, dingy interior.  They don't accept cards at all which was annoying when we had to pay $2 for it there ATM just to pay them. I don't know if they're too cheap to put in for a card reader? The manager, I'm assuming, seated us but came out in street clothes. The inside of the building looks reckless. It seriously needs an overhaul. We've heard good things and there were a lot of people there so we ignored all of this. The servers were pretty slow but were nice enough. We wanted to make a substitution in one of the meals and were told we were not allowed to. If we ordered our meal we had to get what came with it and Order what we wanted separately. We would have paid the difference. The most disappointing part was the food. The only good thing was the waffle. I got eggs benedict that came with potato pancakes. The center of my poached eggs were cooked through. The Hollandaise sauce was lumpy and we had been over cooked. The potato pancakes legitimately tasted like fish! What the hell. I also ended up getting sick from the food later in the day. All in all I will never eat here again their old business practices and horrible cooking make it impossible to enjoy the place."}
{"text":"Ate at one of these in MN awhile ago.  Happened to see one in Charlotte and went today.  As was our previous experience, the food was outstanding.    Service...I get that people have bad days sometimes, but it's really hard to part with a 20% or bigger tip when they just act like they could care less if you're here or not."}
{"text":"This place is becoming my favorite breakfast place. I was never a brekkie enthusiast but each visit has brought new discoveries to me. The Dutch baby is an eggy pancake batter, but with the powdered sugar and squeeze of lemon, the contrast between the sweet and sour is unbelievably good.  More notably, I enjoyed potato pancakes for the first time. After spreading the sour cream and apple sauce on top, I couldn't believe how this tasted perfect in my mouth. Once again, the contrast between the sour and sweet was an explosion of flavor. Thanks OPH, you've opened my eyes to brekkie heaven."}
{"text":"The BEST pancakes I have EVER had. That's right, they start their yeast before daylight and make everything from Scratch with the best ingredients! They order their bacon special and their butter is the real deal and perfectly soft. Their syrup is warm like it should be and I don't know why the pancakes don't float up off the plate.   Dispense with the hype and the frills. This is a Midwestern family-owned restaurant run by people who care about quality. It's old school good.   They still care about quality and there is a little bit of love and pride in every bite!   Oh! ... And they serve fresh squeezed orange juice! Enough said!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the ultimate pancake experience, look know further than the Original Pancake house in midtown Charlotte.   The parking is tight and they stay extremely busy so plan accordingly. If you go after 9AM on a weekend the average wait is 20-30 minutes, but they have a waiting area in and outside.   The pancakes are always made to order, way more food than you can eat and the variety of toppings is endless.   The atmosphere is a little on the noisy side, but you don't go to breakfast for a romantic meal."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant and we go frequently. Excellent breakfast food. We especially love the pancakes and French toast. Be sure to use the Nowait app to put your name on the waitlist since it is always busy. They are good about seating quickly despite the crowds. Solid service and a huge menu. Well worth the price."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with my visit here.  I ordered the apple waffle, which was okay, but they didn't have any almond or soy milk for the coffee--that left a bad taste in my mouth. The potatoes I ordered were EXTREMELY salty and had very little flavor.  Potatoes should be a bit crispy and have at least a creamy and a crunchy texture--these were just a salty overload and way overcooked."}
{"text":"Definately a five star experience. Busy Sunday morning - they could not have been more accommodating. The omelets were best ever,  great pancakes. Service was top shelf."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our breakfast here. As soon as we walked in we were seated. I had thick slices of bacon, pancakes, and eggs and he had turkey sausage with grits and eggs. The service was really good and the server was attentive. The only thing was the coffee was a little weak."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow service from our server.   Not the best start.  Came for the apple pancake cuz it's been years since we've had it.  Also ordered the chorizo & cheese omelette.  We're going to split these two entrees so it is going to be more than enough. Coffee is good.  Limited soda selection so my dining guest ordered the strawberry lemonade which gets one free refill.  They do NOT take credit card, it's cash only and for your convenience (?) they have an ATM available.  Seriously, why pay credit card processing fees when you can collect money by making an ATM machine available.  :-p  The omelette WAS yummy, the pancake was pretty good but I actually needed to use a tiny bit of syrup for each bite cuz it seemed to lack the intensity I had remembered.  Must be aging brain cells.  Service picked up once our waitress finally took our order.   It seems there are plenty of regulars that visit this place.  Heads up on the parking.  It seems as if the parking space is kind of lacking.  It looked as if customers have to park in the street it the small lot is full.  Will we be going here again anytime soon?  Nah, it's not likely unless I have an out of town guest or a hankerin' for another apple pancake."}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was absolutely fantastic I got seated quickly and the food was here within 15 minutes or less my server was absolutely fantastic friendly very knowledgeable the food was so pretty very well put together and delicious I will be back again and again"}
{"text":"Good pancakes and coffee - but frequently slow service, incredibly oversized portions and high prices for what you're getting.  My favorite thing on the menu is the Eggs Michael, and a half order is only $1 cheaper than the full order.  If you go on Sunday, you'll have a long wait, and if you go any other day, you may still have a long wait for your food.  I have a few friends who swear by it, but I'd be really just as happy to never go there again."}
{"text":"We came back here again last weekend because we were really craving their giant Dutch Babies! We arrived at about 9:30am on a Saturday, and only waited about 5 minutes for a table for two. Mind you, it does get very busy shortly after that time, so I'd definitely recommend coming here earlier if possible.   Coffee was served almost immediately after we sat down, and service was quick, just like how we remembered it last time. I had the Eggs Michael with Potato Pancakes, while my boyfriend had the Dutch Baby. Both dishes arrived together, and they were massive! My eggs were poached perfectly, and the mushroom sherry sauce was amazing. The Dutch Baby? As big as my head, and wonderfully light and fluffy.   Again, my five star rating still stands for this place. Just remember to come early, and that it's cash only!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since I was a kid and it's one of the best places to get brunch in Chambana. Original Pancake House has never once disappointed me - they consistently deliver delicious breakfast food!  I recommend the apple pancake, the dutch baby, and their vegetarian omelet. Though their crepes, waffles, and regular buttermilk pancakes are super tasty as well.  The wait can be pretty long on the weekends but it's SOO worth it."}
{"text":"Best chocolate chip pancakes in town. This place does diner-style food right. Cash only, which is a bit frustrating, although they have an ATM in-house. And only open until 1:30. My advice would be to get here at about 1PM if at all possible; the place is a madhouse beforehand."}
{"text":"Year round Pumpkin pancake YAAAA! Can get my fall flavor fix when every I want. Will most certainly be stopping by when I'm back in town. Coffee was pretty good for a chain reateraunt. Not burnt or bitter just the way it should be.   Little under staffed...but a good value."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place if I want a light and huge fluffy omelet. The pancakes are just ok. The only thing I feel they are missing on their menu is some type of steak, like country fried steak. But I will definitely keep returning for the omelets!"}
{"text":"We arrived around 10:30, and as usual this place was packed for brunch.  Ahthough we had to wait for a large group, it took 10-15 mins. to seat us in the seperate room they have off to the side of the main dining area.  It was empty all that time, so i wonder why it took so long to get it ready for us?  The food is just OK.  We left pretty full, but not overwhelmed by the taste of the meals.  LIKES: the bacon is very tasty, fresh squeezed OJ, service was OK, lots of variety on the menu  DISLIKES: decor looks old and dingy, prices are a little high for breakfast food, pancakes were a little bland and not as fluffy as I would like them to be  We will try another breakfast place before returning here."}
{"text":"Best baked omelette and bacon pancakes, EVER!   We got there just as they opened on a Sunday morning. By the time we were done the house was packed.   Nice friendly staff. Will definitely be back next time through Champaign."}
{"text":"Breakfast while in Vegas, this place was great! The portions were huge and the variety was awesome.  Crepes, pancakes waffles etc...... this a definite come back to place."}
{"text":"Solid food and good service.  Not stellar, but everything you could ask for, plus generous portions to boot.  They do nothing poorly, and several things darn well.  This place makes a good regular breakfast joint, and as said in other reviews, expect to wait for a table.  If you do become a regular, make friends with the wait staff and you'll discover they're... ful of personality :)"}
{"text":"My brother and I frequent this place. They've cut back on a few things so you need to order the sour cream and apple sauce for your potato pancakes but you don't need to pay extra.  1. Eggs Michael/Venetia/Benedict: I prefer this over the Eggs Benedict because the sauce is lighter and it doesn't make me nauseous. 2 english muffins and 4 potato pancakes with a side of sour cream and apple sauce. The potato pancakes are winners but to be fair, I haven't had potato pancakes anywhere else for comparison. As far as I know, these are made well.  The Venetia comes with spinach if I remember correctly and it's lighter than the Michael. The spinach is starchier than usual and makes your teeth waxy but still delicious.  2. Corned Hash. Really good corned beef with eggs and potatoes. It's a bit too salty for me but the potato pancakes that come with it are a good balance.  3. Dutch Baby. IT'S HUGE. So huge that the two of us (growing guys) couldn't tackle it all. Beware the Dutch Baby. Delicious and worth a try.  4. Any of their omelets ARE HUGE HUGE. I swear they must use 10 eggs each or something. My aunt's husband ordered one and it was bigger than a newborn. I haven't ordered an omelet from them since so you'll need to confirm that.  It's about $22 for two people with tax and tip. Not bad."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, found this place on yelp. Loved it and our server Charlette was the best!"}
{"text":"Deserves maybe closer to a 4.5 for me. Like others said, we went on a Sunday and it was pretty packed. Only waited about 10 min or so. Service was very quick. I ordered an omelet as they all come with 3 pancakes (so can't go wrong with that). Omelet was huge and pancakes delicious with a variety of syrups to match. We also had a blueberry compote waffle and enjoyed it. My only complaint was we were seated by kitchen which was very loud and very busy. Almost hard to even hear conversation. Overall, good food and experience. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I was completely creeped out by the host.  He had an attitude from the minute I walked up!!   Very strange and unwelcoming.. I chose not to eat there..  They don't care about customers.."}
{"text":"We went to the Original Pancake House with friends.  The omelettes are huge and oven baked not cooked on the grill.  Oven baked makes the cheese melt nice and the inside of the omelet fluffy, but it also gives it a strange \"crispy\" exterior.  The potato pancakes look amazing, but I thought they had a funny taste to them.  The pancakes were excellent. I think if I return I will stick to pancakes.  The service was great and there was always someone circulating to offer a coffee warmup."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and every time has been less than impressed with both the service and the food. Most recently, I went here on a Sunday for brunch with my family. The chicken sandwich I ordered was awful. The chicken was undercooked. Despite \"looking\" cooked on the outside, I could tell by the texture that it was not fully cooked - it totally grossed me out and I couldn't eat it. I told the server about it, and he looked at me like he didn't believe me and made some comment that it was cooked on a flat top. He walked away with my plate in hand, and never returned to ask if I would like anything else or to even refill my empty iced tea. I just sat there for 25 minutes while my party ate their food.   I never send food back, but uncooked chicken is a deal breaker for me. I understand busy kitchens, and sometimes the chef misjudges how well cooked the chicken may be. We all make mistakes. But there is no reason to mistreat the customer, especially in this situation. The fact that the server proceeded to ignore me completely while I sat there watching the rest of my party eat their food was just rude. Sure, the server took my meal off the bill, but the fact that I was treated so poorly made an impression that no \"credit\" could make up for. I will never go back to OPH and highly recommend anyone considering a trip there consider other options."}
{"text":"I give this 3 stars because it was just that...OK. I am not sure I get the hype of this place...maybe that there isn't much to offer here in c/u for breakfast? The prices are high for what you get. A bowl of oatmeal...5 bucks?! Really?? Not a good, if any, kids menu. And the food is just okay. No kid size drinks. Only juice was 3 and 4 dollars. Not worth the money in our opinion."}
{"text":"So soon since swerving sinisterly southwestardly to seek stimulus in this sullen economic situation, I found the syrupy soaked security of a seemingly \"regulars\" secret scene to engage in mutual swelling!   My eyes were bigger than my stomach as each word on the menu left me wondering if they could truly deliver something more than the average diner when it comes to omelettes and pancakes.  Then I began to see what would become my breakfast dining goal for the next few years...\" an apple pancake\" more beautiful than any other.  But I did not allow that evil ice cream laden morsel to sway me.  Yes, I owe it to all my Yelp fans to remain objective and focused and what?!!  Did I just eat that Dutch Pancake \"soufle\"?  Did I really get lemons and confection sugar like the old country?  Was it the biggest rumour ever that I finished that ( and a side of canadian bacon) all by myself in less than 20 minutes?    Disclaimer:  I might have passed this place up on the road but, thank goodness my friend Henri knew where to stop and was able to look beyond the Motel 6 that is attached to the premises.  This attempt to remain incognito did not stop the line from peeling out of the door.  Nor did the fact that there is no way to pay with a credit card or debit card!  Thank goodness there is an ATM in there.    But if you decide to look past that, and focus on the awesome family like hospitality of the staff and the scrumptousness of the wafflisciousness of  whatever dish you decide to savour, you will become a hush hush admirerer who is not trying to make it harder to get in for food on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Great classic American Breakfast food - and of course, lots of varieties of Pancakes! Buttermilk, Creeps, potato cakes, French toast, etc.  Be sure to try the signature apple bake!  And now they take credit cards!"}
{"text":"YUM.  Absolutely delcious diner food.  I had the cherry crepes and they were spectacular. My friend had the coconut pancakes and I'll definitely get those next.  The bacon I ordered was 'eh'. I asked for crispy, but it was a tad overcooked.  There is a wait for this place, but is well worth it.  Bring CASH."}
{"text":"Despite only accepting cash, (which I rarely carry) this is one of my favorite breakfast spots in the city.   They are always busy, the food is always impeccable, and the service is always friendly.  Their prices are super reasonable as well.   Some of my favorites: any of the crepes, the veggie omelet, their bacon is awesome, and the hash browns are wonderful, especially when you ask for them extra crispy.   Definitely visit. But be sure to bring cash. There IS an ATM, but it charges a fee. Best to have cash on hand first."}
{"text":"Original Pancake House will be the reason I gain endless amounts of weight. The food here is so delicious! It tastes like a homemade southern breakfast and I can never get enough. Every time I come here, I make sure I get the pumpkin pancakes-they are out of this world!  If you come on Saturday or Sunday, definitely expect a wait. But I will tell you, the wait is worth it! And it's honestly never thaaaat long-you can do it! The omelets are definitely something to note. They are huge and always so tasty!! My favorite one is definitely the steak one-so many amazing flavors.  The menu is very extensive so I try to order something different every time but it's so hard since what I have gotten is just soooo good!  So definitely make a trip here and eat some good southern breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"Drove here from Peoria on a recommendation from my husbands co-workers. And the drive was worth it!  The restaurant has an old school restaurant feel and was very clean. We were seated immediately, and our server took our order quickly, and she was very friendly. I had the southwestern scramble with potato pancakes. It was so good that I wanted more, but I was SO full! Husband had biscuits and gravy, hash browns and sausage. The gravy was delicious and the hash browns tasted amazing!  It's a haul from our house, but well worth the drive. Can't wait to come back and try the Dutch baby! We saw several come out of the kitchen and it looks fantastic!"}
{"text":"Had an opportunity to eat here last night, as it was the first time in many years since my last visit.  The staff was friendly, the location was clean, and the food was good.  I usually do not visit such places in the evenings, but the younger one wanted to have some pancakes, so where do you go.......she said  \"The Original Pancake House\".  This has a more limited menu than most places, but it is not lacking in the pancakes and breakfast department.  I can see why this place is a staple, and I could not imagine trying to get in the doors for Breakfast as it is surely crowded with regulars and hungry people.  Good Value for the money.  NCFoodGuy"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my meal today . My bacon was undercook when I asked to make ur crispy it came back as if it was deep fried so greasy . The strawberries on my pancake had a weird taste that made the entire meal unpleasant . To put icing on my total experience the waitress was extremely rude and seek like she hated her job and never came to check on us or to give us our check. I really with I would have went to my normal location in South Park where every experience is awesome. I guess never come here a hour before they close"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get breakfast in Madison! I always get the belguim waffle with strawberries and lots of whipped cream! Absolutely delicious every time! They have freshly squeezed orange juice that is just so sweet and delicious and their bacon is always the perfect amount of crispiness. Staff are always very friendly and service is quick! The only downside is that there are never enough parking spaces in their tiny lot, so best to come as early as possible. (The neighboring stores don't allow customers to park in their spaces.) Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"First time I ate hear I went of the reservation and decided to try something different instead of pancakes. I ordered the beef hash stuffed omelette and my wife ordered salami and eggs. Totally different than we had seen it prepared anywhere else. A little warning from the waiter would have been nice. The did had delicious fresh squeezed orange juice. And the hash was good just a lot of crispy egg."}
{"text":"had i written about this place after my 1st experience i would say it's way over priced & crappy food. the first time out we ordered corned beef hash omelette & salami & eggs. we were not expecting what we got. an enormous portion. had to be 8-10 eggs used. the hash was good but the salami & eggs was bad-sliced salami cooked into eggs-yuck!!! the waiter wasn't very helpful about asking if we had ever been,etc.  now the 2nd trip we decided to stick with the pancakes & boy were they good. mine was practically a cinnamon apple pie & it was sooooo good. a little pricey $50 for 3 people for breakfast. i'd recommend sticking to the pancakes & waffles & fresh squeezed oj."}
{"text":"First, I like to say the food here was really good. The food gets 4+ stars. Unfortunately they do (or don't do for that matter) one of my pet peeves. They don't accept credit or debt cards. Other than being a pain in the rear, they're profiting extra from people who didn't bring cash with them. Yes, they have an ATM. The service charge is $1.75 per transaction. I don't see why a legitimate business in 2014 wouldn't  accept credit or debt cards."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed. Here the portions Are SMALL and the service SLOW. Very Impersonal. The REAL Original pancake house on \"Charleston & Decatuer\"  Now CLOSED  DOWN. THEY WHERE A VEGAS LEGEND, A REAL GEM and Landmark. A MUST STOP TO EAT! VERY POPULAR PLACE! They had HUGH portions, great Food & excellent service, Very Friendly, personable and Fun staff. Always Fresh Food & real good coffee. Hugh omelets, Great pancakes, desserts, everything was delicious and BIG MANLY SIZED PORTIONS!  Always stopped in several times on my Vegas trips since 1996 till closing. What remorse knowing this Gold Standard Is Now part of Past History, and the reputation is Now Tarnished by Low standards & poor over all quality of food, help, service & smaller portions. This place is not even a shadow of the \"REAL ORIGINAL\", nothing exceptional here, just another average place. The Great original is sorely missed. This is a \"Charlatan\" of The Original that's Now Closed! What a Shame ! Greatness Gone! Original was always alive & full of life ! NOT HERE! NOT A GLIMMER OF THE GREAT ORIGINAL PLACE ! TOO BAD!! \"Can't  CLONE the Original\"!"}
{"text":"The pancakes are obviously delicious but I feel like they could do better in other other parts of the menu, for example there are only few varieties of savory food items."}
{"text":"This place wasn't how I remembered it. Before I moved to Vegas, I came here and was blown away by their portions and German style breakfasts. I came back recently, and I was a bit disappointed.   The wait was 20 minutes. Not terrible...this is a very popular place. One of their locations in Vegas closed a couple years ago, so I can imagine they've dealt with the overflow traffic from that.   I ordered the Fresh Vegetarian Omelette with egg whites and light on the cheese and hash browns instead of pancakes. I despise pancakes. The omelettes take a very long time to make (about 20 minutes) since they are baked in an oven. It is very nice that they state this on the menu.   We waited about 20 minutes for our orders, which isn't anything out of the ordinary for this place. The food came out piping hot. Sadly, I was super dissapointed with the omelette. It lacked flavor and I was forced to douse it in salt and ketchup. Additionally, it was incredibly fluffy, so although it looked GIGANTIC, it wasn't at all filling. Also, since I asked for light cheese, the cheese was all in one clump only on one side of the omelette..inside of it. So, I had an entire omelette with no cheese, and then about 4 giant bites of cheese.  The hash browns were not hash browns at all. They were potatoes. I don't remember seeing this on the menu, but it certainly wasn't explained. I'm sure they were \"German potatoes,\" but that wasn't what I wanted.   I will come back here to give this place another chance, but probably not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I would give this place less than 1 star if it were possible. This particular locations food made me sick. One bite and I was in the restroom throwing up. The manager was less than understanding and insisted on the foods freshness (which I never questioned). I only said that it made me sick. He kept going on about how nobody else got sick and I said that was fine, but it made ME sick. He got indignant with me calling me a liar and I had to tell him that I wasn't gonna pay for my food.  Been going to the original pancake house for 20yrs in various states and this is the 1st time I have ever thrown up and the 1st time I have been treated badly.  You can go here if u want, but I will never return."}
{"text":"5*STARS EASY! I've been here 3 or 4 times already and they're consistently Delicious each time. Their plates are large, fresh, very tasty, and creative. They arguably have the best breakfast you can eat, but for sure THE BEST BREAKFAST IN LAS VEGAS! . Def a must go. It's off the strip, but its doesn't take long to get to; it's definitely worth the drive! Just get there b4 they close!!!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast choice. They even offer some healthier choices these days, which is appreciated. Service can be a bit slow during busy breakfast times. I'm giving them an extra Yelp star for offering the online waitlist, which is an awesome feature!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Place and all the food is great although I wish they had Shredded hash browns instead of country potato hash browns.  I usually get the strawberry French toast or the Dutch Baby which is the same as a German Pancake!!  There is usually always a wait but it moves fast and they use the NoWait app so you know right where you are at in line or get in line in advance!!"}
{"text":"After waiting about an hour for a seat, I am not quite sure what the hype is about this place. I was an out of town visitor and the convenience to the mall/shopping is great, but the food i could have missed. I LOVE breakfast/brunch and this wasn't a memorable meal. Don't get me wrong, the portion size and prices were decent, but there are better places for breakfast vs waiting an hour or more here.   i did like the fact that they used the wait system that texts you when your food is ready. So we took that time to shop at the local stores in the same shopping center. The service was also great, which is why I gave it an extra star.  WARNING: if you plan to order the one of a kind griddle pancakes, it requires about 25 minutes to bake!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Great service, great menu choices, clean and efficient. I ordered the German Pancake, and it was better than the one I make. Theirs was soft but firm, very fluffy and so tasty with the powdered sugar and lemon. (The lemon makes it). My dining partners got the crepes, which also looked tasty - and good for a modest appetite. Coffee was a serviceable (Cracked Egg has better coffee, IMHO).   Overall, great experience and will be back. Irish omelet looks good for next time. :)"}
{"text":"I {heart} breakfast.  Usually, I try to make it my biggest meal of the day... with the thinking that I have the whole day to burn it off.  It's also that mix of savory and sweet that makes breakfast my fav.  The Original Pancake House is great... I had been avoiding it due to the large crowds and waiting time it draws on the weekends, but it is definitely worth the wait.  Or if you can finagle an \"off\" time to beat the crowds, it's just a great thing.  They open up at 6:30am on weekdays and if you plan accordingly, you can start your day off just right.  Pretty much any breakfast staple is good here.  I'm probably 99.96% sure I will always get a Benedict.  Staffers here are super nice and the servers are quick to refill your coffee.  Definitely leave satisfied every time.  The trick to this midtown location is that it has a small parking lot.  With the addition of the new apartments next door, parking is definitely a challenge, but doable.  I would recommend walking if you live near the area.  As an added bonus, you can go right from breakfast into the ABC store next door."}
{"text":"You know I really wanted to give this place a higher rating, because the manager who works here is on top of his game. He saw that I was waiting for a table and he immediately stepped in and helped out. Plus, my waiter was so sweet.  But.... For the 45 minutes we sat there, there were 3 different mix ups. I did not order fruit and was brought fruit. We asked for mustard but was brought whipped cream. We did not ask for jams but brought out jams. I think they could have done a better job of remember which table it is, the logistics is very messed up here. It really ruins the experience makes you feel like you are just another diner. Needs to do a better job of personalizing if you want to be a true competitor to iHop.   Also, the pancakes I had were very dry."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in to the packed space, you can feel the history of the place.  It is almost a tradition for our family to take our friends in town here, as they have the best breakfast in all of Phoenix, and the best pancakes in the world! Even their coffee is amazing!   No wonder so many celebrities and athletes have gone over the years!"}
{"text":"Just had a great breakfast at OPH.  This restaurant is easy to overlook, it is old and next to the Motel 6--but wait!!!  Go in...the food is really good at a reasonable price. Asked for bacon that was not gooey, bendy ie raw--came thick and crisp. Daughter wanted eggs, bacon and pancakes--but a specialty kind.  The waitress upgraded the pancakes to coconut for a 1.50 up charge.  What a deal."}
{"text":"Really good coffee in a not small mug. Good service and tasty food (I had an apple Belgian waffle with Turkey bacon). I'll be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here around 8am on a Sunday morning.  I started with a cup of coffee and ordered corned beef hash with an extra egg (for a total of 3) over easy and rye toast.  She ordered the vegetarian omelette with the default pancakes on the side.  I have to start with the coffee.  For what is ostensibly a diner, the coffee's got to be good.  This coffee was not.  I'm not sure if it had been sitting in a heated carafe for too long, but it was extremely acidic.  If I wasn't so tired, I'd have gotten something else to drink.  I'm not terribly picky about my coffee as long as it tastes like coffee and has caffeine, but this was just bad.  The food was disappointing.  The corned beef hash wasn't really a hash...it didn't really have any identifiable pieces of potato or onion.  It was a monochrome dark pink color with little texture.  Slop, even.  Regardless of its content, it would have been a lot better if it had some extra time on the griddle, allowing a nice crust to form.  No such luck.  It was mushy, VERY salty even for corned beef hash, and just not that great.  My rye toast was undertoasted.  Only one side of one of the four pieces had any appreciable color to it.  The butter served alongside my wife's waffles didn't even melt, meaning it had been sitting for a bit and got cold, so they definitely had some extra time they could have used to toast it more deeply.  The eggs were perfectly cooked with warm runny yolks.  The whites themselves were completely pale white with no browning, but I won't hold that against them since I didn't ask for crispy whites or anything.  My wife enjoyed her omelette, though it had what must have been four ounces of cheese in it.  Way too much, and I love cheese, but some people must like that.  Her pancakes, however, were undercooked.  I tried a few bites and they definitely had uncooked batter in the center.  Really disappointing, for a restaurant with \"pancake\" in its name.  Service was fine, but I don't think we'd come back."}
{"text":"Decent food, great service, fair price.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I had there apple pancake all I tasted was eggs it was disgusting. I will never come back here"}
{"text":"The food here is nothing special, but the OPH gets points for value and efficiency. If you're looking for a quick, tasty, standard breakfast joint this will fit the bill. They deal really well with kids also, which is a plus when you're wrangling your 3 year old."}
{"text":"Wow...you'd never believe that this place is a franchised restaurant, they hide it very well. If you're hungover on a Saturday or Sunday morning, head over to The Original Pancake House to ease your woes.  Their breakfast selection is absolutely huge, anything you can think of to have for breakfast, they have it. From pancakes, to waffles, to omelets, absolutely anything. Not only is every item I've had very good, it's also very filling. They give you very big portions for a pretty decent price. I promise you that the food here will not disappoint & you'll be heading back here again.  The breakfast/brunch crowd is always huge on the weekends, with people always waiting for tables. You may not enjoy your wait, but it's well worth it because you'll leave full & happy, without all those hangover woes.  The Original Pancake House will make you feel like you're eating at a homegrown restaurant, because the food tastes so fresh & homemade. So while it is a great place to catch breakfast/brunch in Charlotte, it is a little disappointing for me. I'd rather go to a local breakfast business to get true freshness in my breakfast. But if you're just looking for a great breakfast, with so many choices to choose from, then The Original Pancake House will definitely impress you & having you coming back again."}
{"text":"I usually just edit my reviews, but I bumped up to four stars rather than three. I have been here three times and each time it has gotten better. My coffee cup was never empty, we waited 10 minutes rather than the 25 I was expecting, and FLUFFY AZZ OMELETS!  What a gem here in Central Illinois. I will say right now (again), they do not have buckwheat pancakes as the Walker Brothers' Restaurant group menu says. Don't let that sway you my gluten free fans! My brother and I arrived at 1215 on Sunday after a workout at the infamous PBL Work/Weight Room. This is about 30 minutes north of Champaign. We knew we would have to wait 20 minutes since it was a Sunday. No problem, the first time I had this place was no wait (on a Saturday). Sunday is omelet and 'cake time! They have coffee up front for those waiting, so it worked out that they were treated to a cup of joe (and refills).   So we were seated, and when I inquired about buckwheat (love the nutty ((yar)) flavor), I was told no buckwheat. Now, each omelet comes with three buttermilk pancakes. Nothing wrong with buttermilk...but why not go into a culinary adventure this friggin' cold January day? I asked about the \"bran\" pancakes...don't let it fool you, Grandpa. Oat bran, yogurt, strawberries, and powdered sugar sounds good to me! My brother ended up ordering them sans strawberries and powdered sugar (they dusted them....brother didn't care...all he cared about was the waitress willing to remake them). I went with the bacon pancakes and savory is an  understatement! So delicious!  They have a ton of pancake options (not a lot of whole grain/more fiber options), but bacon, Hawaiian, blueberry, and oatmeal raisin (which I got on a previous visit) should suffice for you pancake purists.  Anyways, we both knew of the fluffy omelet reputation because of plates coming out and pictures. Brother built his own and I went with the Western and my goodness...the flavor, the fluffiness, and the fantastic coffee I ordered went so well together. Fresh veggies in January? YES PLEASE!  The pancakes were great, but the omelets kicked a$$.. If you want average, go to Bob Evans.    I wish the omelets came with fruit/hash browns, but three smaller pancakes is better than two, so I guess they it's okay. I will be back for sure!  If you think you're being an original by going to OPH, you'd be wrong! I would gladly go back here, spend 25 bucks (two people) not including the generous tip we left. Our waitress was great; she felt bad about the powdered sugar but it wasn't her fault. Speaking of the waitresses, thank you U of I undergrad/grad students. You were eye candy I enjoyed! Does that sound creepy? Maybe? Is it the truth? Yes, middle aged 20 somethings are very attractive.   We even got a pitcher of water since I drink water like U of I gives up touchdowns.  If you're looking for a great meal, come here!"}
{"text":"Yikes don't try and get a burrito without meat and cheese you would have thought I asked for the moon!  I was told that the cooks would do it this one time but don't come back on the weekend and expect that to happen again.  How hard is it to remove something from an item That has to be assembled anyhow?  Our waitress made a huge deal out of it and that we should be pretty grateful they were willing to do it."}
{"text":"We had another $20 Groupon.  My friends ordered their favorite Dutch Garden and Venetia Benedict.   I ordered the Bacon and Eggs which came with 3 Buttermilk Pancakes.  The bacon was thick and crisp, just the way I like it.  The 2 eggs were made-to-order.  The 3 buttermilk pancakes were okay.  It was a little pricey for bacon and eggs.  The server brought us the check soon after she delivered our food to the table.  So no water refills or any other service.  We paid at the cashier.  I know my friends will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place, I always order the same thing at this location: Hash browns and Eggs, Sub for banana nut Pancakes.  Here is what you need to know: Original Pancake House is a franchise, however it is not the same in all locations, the Charlotte location's both share what appears to be the same menu. I have also visited the one in Northern VA, and South field MI. The main differences are the prices, combinations, and menu layouts. The main thing they all have in common is the best pancakes that you can find at a restaurant period.  That being said, every year after Ramadan ends, Muslim's usually go to breakfast. I credit myself as the person that fought for everyone to go to OPH, which I we know as OHOP, because everyone always wanted to go to iHop. There was a staunch iHOP supporter in our cliche, but she thankfully has retreated to Jordan, but sadly I have also made a tactical withdraw to Michigan where the OPH is not quite the same.   Why OPH, is better than IHOP:  1. They will allow to sub anything for anything, and pay the difference, IHOP will not. example: IHOP will not allow you sub meat for non-meat, even if you don't eat meat!  2. OPH has better options for people who don't want to eat meat, but do want to eat eggs.  example: Hash brown and eggs Combo comes with Pancakes.  3. OPH pancakes are perfection, IHOP pancakes are a joke and are only eaten as a result of good marketing and advertising.   4. OPH has better syrup, made from fresh ingredients. The strawberry syrup is made with real strawberries, The Blueberry is made with real blueberries.  This cannot be said about IHOP. Think about that next time you are at IHOP trying to pull that syrup jug that's stuck on the table to pour over your lowsy IHOP pancakes.  5. OPH omellets are bigger and better, granted that are different style. Example: I brought my friend there, and before we order I asked him, \"Are you ready?\". He didn't what I was talking about until the mammoth omelet came out. I am sure OPH is a great way to put your kids to sleep for the day, worth trying.   IHOP omellets aren't bad as long as they don't cross contaminate your food, with things you don't want.  I think I have made my point, the take away here, is OPH has the best pancakes period, if you know better send me a message or something."}
{"text":"The food is good. How ever they always confuse the order. The wait staff appears over worked."}
{"text":"I got the baked apple pancake. It was large and filling but didn't seem especially well prepared. It was thick and heavy. I didn't finish it. I also got a side of bacon and that was average."}
{"text":"I know the Original Pancake House is pretty well known around town, and I'm sure a lot of people reading this have dined there at least once (with mixed reviews), but I feel I can give a fair assesment of the best dishes on (and off) the menu, so I'd like to share them. I've been eating here for years and have come to th conclusion that you really do have to know what to order here, since not everything is as good as the pancakes (i.e the eggs benedict - go to Payard's in Caesar's for this).  I feel the omelets are the best option, which is one reason my anti-omelet husband would rather go to the Egg and I (he's a 'breakfast skillet' kind of guy). The omelets here are tremendous, both in flavor and size. I love that if you have a willing dining companion you can split one and both be completely satiated for a reasonable price. Normally I opt for the Western or the spicy Fiesta omelet, but this time we had the Irish, which included their home made corned beef hash and cheddar cheese enveloped in fluffy eggs. It was scrumptious, and might be my new favorite. Since the omelets come with a side of pancakes or toast, I always get pancakes (who would get toast?) and I ALWAYS upgrade to something more interesting than the ordinary plain cakes. This gets more expensive if you are ordering alone here (not recommended, you'll get to look like the people around you), but if you are sharing, it is totally worth it. I really like the blueberry and coconut varieties, but this time we shared something particularly indulgent, bacon AND chocolate chip pancakes, served with nothing less than freshly whipped cream. This is not on the menu, and the waitress might look at you funny (as ours did) but I promise you'll like it. It is reminiscent of the Voges chocolate bar, Mo's Milk Chocolate Bacon Bar (also highly recommended), and packs a powerful punch with a few of Earth's finest offerings - sugar, flour, bacon, whipped cream, and of course, chocolate. I'm actually not a chocoholic by any means, but these pancakes steer me in that direction. If you're in the mood to be sinful, these will make you feel like the devil. You can wash it all down with a glass of freshly squeezed orange or grapefruit juice, which are much better than juices offered at any other off-strip breakfast places.  To summarize, come here for the omelets, pancakes, corned beef hash, and juice - nothing else is that good. (Oh, i forgot to mention the potato pancakes are smokin')"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Super friendly and courteous. Today on the same visit a gentleman came in and was irate and the ladies were super gracious in spite of his negative attitude. The lady he was yelling at kept her poise and he is in his truck right now posting his promised \"tell everyone on social media about this\". The guy wanted them to give him a booth while he waited for a friend for 30 minutes. They said that they were unfortunately too busy to accommodate at the time, and the guy got loud and started crying about the place. Grow up man. This place is great, highly recommend the potato pancakes, killer."}
{"text":"They are always pleasant and the food is good with reasonable prices.  Standard breakfast and lunch fare with the addition of the Dutch Baby (Enormous) and the omelet (Enormous).  Those are enough to share unless you've got a tapeworm.  They have a good selection of crepes, too."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast spot & they are always friendly and get you in as quickly as possible when there is a wait.  Their selections are good and everything is prepared well.  The dutch baby is sort of a fluffy crepe and plenty to share.  I love their potato pancakes, very light and tasty.  You get one refill with hot chocolate!  I like that on busy weekends they set up a complimentary coffee station right inside the door.  Just FYI their OJ is pulpy."}
{"text":"A nice filling breakfast and good customer service!"}
{"text":"My husband and I split a few dishes this morning so we could have some variety. We usually get our own omelette's, which are always amazing, but we wanted to branch out. We ended up still going with an omelette, The Western, with its usual side of pancakes. We also split an Eggs Benedict with the crispy hash browns. Everything was absolutely amazing. Service was great, and we both cleaned our plates. Their omelette's are huge so I'm always quite proud of myself when I can make a huge dent.   I especially liked the Eggs Benedict. Nothing quite like poached eggs and Canadian bacon on an English muffin. I've also had their Eggs Michael before, which is equally as delicious. I can't be sure but I believe the hollandaise is replaced with a sherry mushroom sauce.  Every time we come here, we leave happy. We have been to both locations and have never had a bad experience. You get what you pay for, unlike a lot of other overpriced breakfast spots in Charlotte. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My youngest son's future Father-In-Law had Breakfast at this Original Pancake House location yesterday... the very first time I've been to an OPH, even when I was living here... I was just shaking with anticipation of a great Breakfast.  On the menu...  Irish Corned Beef Hash (***) A Homemade Hash, with a blend of Kosher Corned Beef, Potatoes, Onions and Cream. This entree, under the category \"Specialties of the House\" should have been rated under two-Stars, but because of it's heftiness the concoction provides a Value deserving of something a litte higher. All the \"Specialties\" are Oven-Baked... I asked the waitress what is the difference between an Oven-Baked entree versus something you just grill in a Frying Pan...   She replied that this was actually her fist week... and that she'd get back to me...    Otherwise, this is a rather pedestrian and a very bland \"Specialty\" entree... The concoction was pretty high... over three inches, but not because of it's fluffiness.... but rather because of all it's ingredients literally piled on top of each other  I later found out, with the help of my son, that Oven Baking this entree supposedly provides a Fluffiness to the entree that Frying does not provide and supposedly the entree is NOT folded over as with traditional Omelets. But, he further added, that the Yolk of the Eggs are supposed to be separated from Whites and the ingredients are layered during the Oven Baking process.  BTW, all the Specialty items will require a close to 20 minute wait for your Entree... because of the Oven Baking...  Side Order of 3-Buttermilk Pancakes (* 1/2 Came with Meal) I always have to provide a rationale to my son about how I judge Pancakes, especially Flour based Pancakes.   1) Fluffiness - You have two extremes under this category - The    Heavy-Ass Pancake - where it is sooo heavy that you have to go right    after your meal. And then there's the light-as-a-feather Pancake that    will have you consuming close to a dozen without any ill effects.    Unfortunately, OPH's Pancakes are the HEAVY kind...   2) Absorption - Again, there are two extremes under this category...    Pancakes that seemingly act like a Sponge - no matter how much    Syrup you pour onto the Pancake... the Pancake still needs more    and more and more. And then there's the Pancakes the seeming are    resistant to Syrup (or any kind of liquid) - the Pancakes just will not    absorb Syrup, but you can sop up the Syrup with each fork-full.  OPH's Pacakes are the worst of the two qualities I mentioned above... HEAVY - and I mean H-E-A-V-Y... and no matter how much Syrup you put on... the Pancakes WILL still need more!  Coffee (***) The Best part of the meal, mainly because it was not objectionable. But the Coffee did not have any positive attributes either.  After talking to my youngest son about my experience at Original Pancake House yesterday, he said that this specific location was supposedly the worst OPH location in Las Vegas. I guess fate drove me here. BTW, my son is a fanatic about OPH... in a good way..."}
{"text":"i went here because i kept hearing about how good it was.  the food was good but nothing to get really excited over.  the service was good too.  what shocked me was my bill because it was way higher then what i expected it would be.  after looking it over, i saw that the drinks is what killed me.  2 orange juices for $3. each and a small apple juice at $2.50.  there was no alcohol in these drinks folks.  crazy right? or am i just crazy? idk"}
{"text":"I saw this place featured on DDD and my mouth watered upon viewing the apple cake and dutch baby. I drove the 45 minutes up the 101 to get my hands on this delectible meal. The service was ok, nothing special, borderline rude, but I don't let that ruin my meal if it's good. I was super happy to see that they offer Junior portions of their famous pancakes. So yes, I had two. I ordered the apple cake and the dutch baby (don't judge me) Both cakes were better looking than tasting. The middle of both cakes were a unsweetened chewy flan-like consistency. The edge of the apple cake was ok so I ate that along with my hashbrowns and bacon but still left slightly unsatisfied. I also had to pay for the rest of my party when we realized that they do not accept credit cards! ????!!!! There is an atm that charges a $5 fee, yay. I won't be back, the drive is too far for something that is just meh."}
{"text":"Fun place. Great view of downtown.  A lil tight on the parking. The french press coffee was fun..."}
{"text":"I've passed this place about 1,000 times but never stopped in, came for Sunday family breakfast and we were in love!   For a mid Sunday morning the wait wasn't bad - though keep in mind they won't seat you until your entire party is present...   Service was okay but the food is the best part (obviously). I had a veggie omelet, they give you the choice of cheese (Swiss, cheddar or Gouda) so, so, so good. The veggies taste fresh and the cheese is mixed in and not just plopped on top like other places - not to be mentioned.   With that it even comes with a short stack of pancakes which taste just as great.   Everyone loved their meals and for a family of 6 our bill was under $79.  We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Fresh coffee, quickly and excellently prepared pancakes, friendly service - everything that you can expect from a breakfast shop. Loved it."}
{"text":"I often stop in here at least once when I am in Charlotte on business, and always with a co-worker that is a local. Good coffee and pigs in a blanket - love it."}
{"text":"Is this the only breakfast spot in uptown?  The omlet was good but SO FLUFFED with batter that I didnt feel like I was eating eggs, not my favorite.  Service was quick, polite and helpful with coffee refills.  Place was very busy even at the late hour that I made it in for breakfast.  I was happy with the diner fare menu and ambiance."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to go for breakfast, especially pancakes! Unfortunately I don't get to go very often but when I do I'm never disappointed! I also make sure to go to the San Diego Original Pancake house when visiting my father and have never had any complaints! I highly recommend Original Pancake House to all my friends looking for a great breakfast/brunch dining experience!"}
{"text":"Very tasty dutch babies.  Delicious baked omlette.  Waitress was on top of it and super friendly.  Yummy coffee.  Definitely an \"older\" crowd.  The ambience hasn't been updated since the early 80s probably and is covered with a multitude of  \"NO _____\",  \"DO NOT _____\" \"Outside Drink Not Allowed\" etc posters all over the walls giving it the look and feel of of a middle school gym..... are all those warnings and policy posters necessary?"}
{"text":"Absolute garbage food. Went here as a local recommended it last night, he must have been drunk as hell. We left our food on the table. 2 bites out of each and we could stomach no more. This must be a regular occurrence there as the staff seemed not to notice the full table of 'food'. Begrudgingly paid the tab and tipped, as it wasn't the severs fault the chefs are from Craigslist. I can only imagine that this is what soup kitchens during WWII were like when food was rationed and meals were cooked on the same grill and instead of butter they used axle grease or lard from dead prisoners.   Do. Not. Go. Here."}
{"text":"Only reason for two stars is because bf loved his buckwheat cakes. My vegetarian omelet however was really awful. Consistency, presentation, flavor=not good. It looked like a flying saucer landed on my plate. We had a Groupon which is the only reason we dined here. I would consider going back as long as I didn't order the yucky omelet again."}
{"text":"This is my number one spot for non-buffet breakfast/brunch in Vegas and definitely in my Top three anywhere!! If there's a special occasion, I always make sure to stop by/bring people by here because it makes that day/weekend all the more wonderful.  Clearly this place is amazing, so expect a line during peak hours. I agree the service and portions seem to fluctuate a bit lately, but not significantly enough to deter me, as the food quality seems to be consistent. Plan accordingly, and this place will easily earn your four to five star review.   -Their German pancakes are huge, fluffy, and perfect as they are.. yet somehow they manage to go an extra mile of awesome with the Dutch Garden!! A colorful mix of veggies with a healthy serving of Gouda cheese, baked to perfection on that yummy German pancake! -The Venecia Benedict is my guilty pleasure.. I almost always order this, and never regret it even if I was teetering on another order. It has everything you need and want from breakfast. The best of breakfast vegetables (spinach and mushroom), thick crispy bacon, perfectly poached eggs with runny yolks, on top of a crunchy and chewy English muffin to sop up the creamy Hollandaise sauce!! -Potato Pancakes ARE A MUST TRY!! With or without the traditional sour cream and applesauce, it's always a hit. -Great Corn Beef and Hash! -Giant delicious fluffy BAKED omelets! You can't go wrong with any of them (let alone anything on the menu)! -The waffles are also everything you ever want Belgian Waffles to be! Fresh strawberry or blueberry waffles are my personal favorite.  -Fresh squeezed juices, fresh whipped cream, homemade applesauce and blueberry compote, warmed honey, unforgettable potato pancakes and coffee good enough to take black. So many little things that make this place amazing."}
{"text":"Had to kill some time while a family member was having outpatient surgery. Had a late brunch here. The service was wonderful. Was quickly seated and attended to. I had the chorizo omelette which was exceptional. Huge portion and very light and fluffy. It came with an absolutely dynamite homemade salsa! I ordered a side of thick bacon and it was, indeed, truly thick and absolutely delicious. This is on a Monday morning. Was crowded but no wait for seating. Parking can be a bit of a challenge."}
{"text":"This place gets busy and you need to plan accordingly.  I often favor the dutch baby pancake and that takes a long time so make sure you have good conversationalists at your table.  You could also all just stare at your phones for 30 minutes.  They make good eggs and have plenty of toast options.  I almost always stick to crepes and dutch babies.  The eggs benedict is done well as are all the savory optiona.  The has browns aren't.  They are home fries.  Plenty of pepper so beware."}
{"text":"The original pancake house has a special place in my heart as my Dad starting taking me to the one in Detroit (yes, its a franchise) when I was a kid. When we found one in our native Southern California we were very excited, and when I realized this place was right around the corner from my new digs in Scottsdale.....I nearly freaked out.  This is the best breakfast place you will ever eat at. The food is amazing and very consistent. I get the 49er flap jack everytime. The apple pancake and \"dutch baby\" are RIDICULOUSLY huge and delicous. We ordered a half one and split it amongst the table as a \"breakfast desert\"....it was amazing.   This particular location accepts cash only, so make sure you hit the ATM before you go but put this on your list of \"must eat\" places in town and try it....you'll never eat at the IHOP again...."}
{"text":"I have frequented OPH for over 15 years. I used to goto the Decatur location but soooo sadly it burned down :( I've visited this location for the last 8 years or so. I always bring family here when they are in town. We usually all go for holidays too!  My usual breakfast is the Hawaiian pancakes with strawberry syrup and their cheesy german potatoes. So the pancakes are filed with pineapple and dusted with powdered sugar, they're usually served with tropical syrup but their fresh made strawberry syrup is THE BOMB! Ill usually get the half order unless I'm really hungry. The german potatoes are cut in squares then cooked with a lil onion then I like mine with cheese so they melt cheddar over them.   The prices are high. The OJ is awesome but I don't like to pay $5 for a small cup. Get their coffee it's solid! They get very very busy so get there pretty early or be prepared to wait. We've never had a horrible server and this last time we got REALLY lucky with our server. There were 10 of us including 5 kids!!! She didn't miss a beat during service, I wish I could remember her name!!!! So now to the reason I'm only giving a 2 star review. I asked to speak to the manager and he came out(he has gray/brown hair and a mustache) I proceeded to tell him how fabulous our server was and how she made our breakfast even better. He then looked at me like I was speaking the African click language and said \"ok\".  ARE YOU SERIOUS!?!? I was giving you a compliment and you make me feel like an idiot. There's a review on here about being asked to give up their table and I didn't wanna believe it but this guy is a serious D-BAG and I can picture him laughing about killing kittens!! I am so sad my usual location burned down because I refuse to go back here ever again. Goto the Cheyenne location!!!"}
{"text":"Bomb omlettes and of course the pancakes are stellar! Great service and fast to the table"}
{"text":"Family owned business. I have never had a bad experienced while dining here and I've gone a good 15 times. My family are regular customers as we often go after church service. I typically get turkey sausage links with scrambled eggs and buttermilk pancakes. I add a side of hash browns which 4 people can eat from.   By far the best breakfast place I've eaten at. Love the food and service. Also, their coffee is excellent! Not watered down at all.  They only take cash or checks! No credit or debit cards! Also, if you choose to dine there on a Saturday or Sunday, get the no later than 9am. The place is very very tiny and the line is out the door. Waiting time can but 20+ mins on a Sunday if you come after 10am."}
{"text":"Best pancakes I have ever had. Amazing. Cash only no plastic kinda sucks. No Splenda sucks.  They have signs everywhere about not using cell phones but c'mon it's 2012 relax."}
{"text":"Grilled ham and cheese is not very good, cheese was not melted and there was way too much ham, but the fries that came with it were really good. Fresh squeezed OJ was good but wasn't really cold. My bf got the pancakes, eggs, and sausage and said they were pretty good but not as good as \"homemade\" (bisquick). Our waitress was nice though"}
{"text":"I never knew this place was part of a chain!  So we decided to eat here before the trip back to Cali, and let me just say the food was decent, a bit pricey for breakfast food and the quantity, but the service was the huge downfall.   So we get sat after a bit of a wait. It took even longer to get greeted. Even after a friend had to hunt down a girl, it took her a while to come over.   She takes our drink order, which took a while to get our drinks. She take our orders, and it took FOREVER to get our food.   Not knowing what to order, I was my usual self:  Double order of Over easy eggs with sausage patties.  Side of hashbrowns to try.  Side of corn beef n hash.  And three pancakes(which were included).    Being that we got there after 12'sh pm, the place wasn't that busy at all. But yet service still bad.   Even worse, they didn't tell us gratuity was included, so we added it. But we had them credit our c/c when we found out. I guess my bad for not reading the bill.      Will I dine here again, highly doubt it. Service was seriously that bad for the money spent...."}
{"text":"Best pancakes on the planet  I'm seriously obsessed. Their syrup is delicious too which is key for real pancake lovers like myself. Their omelettes are oven baked, large and and delicious. Roseville (CA) location has gluten free pancakes and here they don't so that's the only downside for my little one. Fresh squeezed OJ and always quick great service. #1 of of 2 places I've found in Vegas with delicious pancakes. Haven't tried their other famous items but I'm sure they're good too. Always packed on the weekends but quick in and out during the week"}
{"text":"If you've never been here I highly suggest checking it out. I'm not super keen on mornings, or breakfast foods for that matter, but this place is an exception.  I rolled over yesterday and before even getting out of bed I knew I wanted a strawberry waffle, but I knew I didn't want to cook. Original Pancake House was the first place that popped into my mind. When we got there we were told it'd be a 10 minute wait. Always expect a wait here, especially on the weekends. But their turnover is really fast.   They have their own special house coffee blend that I just absolutely love. And do yourself a favor by getting a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. Yea... it's a little expensive. But it's so good it's worth treating yourself occasionally."}
{"text":"This place sucks balls,  no joke.  It was dead on a Wednesday which is fine but now I know why it's dead.  Booth seats weren't clean when we were seated.  Waitress rarely checks up,  had to constantly flag her down.  Food was shitty and is not worth the price.  This is a reminder of why we should check reviews first lol."}
{"text":"To me this is the best place to have breakfast. Excellent meats, which are not common in Madison. Even scrambled eggs are delicious. Toasts are crunchy. My wife likes a Dutch delight, which is an excellent choice if you like a sweat crepe. Super friendly and prompt services whenever we come."}
{"text":"We've been to OPH a handful of times over the years and the service and food are always pretty consistent.  My 14 yo son typically gets some type of pancakes (he likes their chocolate chip) and my husband always gets an omelet and we split it because they are enormous!!!  During our recent visit, we had the Chorizo Omelet and it was quite good...Chorizo, peppers, onions, cheese with a side of salsa (they have green and black olives in their salsa, which is a bit odd but tastes ok) and sour cream.  Their (enormous) omelets also come with a side of pancakes, but we opt for home fries instead.  Their coffee is ok...it's a bit on the strong side for me, but it's acceptable.    Service is always friendly and attentive.  The only major downside is that there is always a long wait on the weekends....so get there early!!  Our last visit was the morning after a night of freezing rain so the restaurant was only busy and not CRAZY busy so we walked right in...and got the last open table.  Score!  Prices a bit high for breakfast ($11.95 for the Chorizo omelet with side of potatoes), but consistent with other breakfast places in the South Park area."}
{"text":"This is my first time here.  I got the vegetarians omelette and it came with 3 buttermilk pancakes.  The portion was pretty big!  I gave it a 2 star reasoning for over all food and service.  The omelette was just okay nothing really to wow about.  But the service and the vibe in her is very depressing.  Never got a refill on my coffee or water."}
{"text":"I love their strawberry pancakes here. They are always big and fluffy, like a pancake should be. Their orange juice is delightful. I always get their toast, Bacon and eggs as well. I love the smell of syrup and coffee in here. Makes for a fantastic morning. Especially on sunny days with a good read."}
{"text":"Food was great - moderately priced.   Bacon pancakes were amazing as well as their ooey- gooey ones.    Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Food was really done well for breakfast.  Buck wheat pancakes were stellar.  Side of salsa amazing, don't forget to ask for it.  Bacon was thick and cooked to perfection.  Everything else was great.  Service was very good.  Definite future visit for me."}
{"text":"I've been to other OPH's, but this one is my favorite.  Ron (the owner?) is an awfully nice fella, and when he stops in to chat with you, you get that warm fuzzy, small-town vibe.  As others have pointed out, on the weekends, the wait is super long -- which should tell you something, but if you are just a party of 2, you can skip the line and hit the small counter bar -- it's first come first serve.  As for the food, with a name like \"original pancake house\", the pancakes are about what you'd expect -- nothing short of perfect.  But don't underestimate other menu choices -- my mother, a chef, said they made the best omelette of her life.  Seriously.  At *this* place.  And the coup de grâce? Order the bacon cheddar grits on the side to share.  The best grits you'll ever eat.  My only gripe, sometimes, is the wait staff is a little shaky.  I recognize they are super busy, and this is a hole in the wall, but sometimes, I don't feel the love ...  sometimes."}
{"text":"Food is Delicious, long wait though.... but worth it. If you haven't been you should definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"Long wait, but I can see why. People drive for miles just to come eat here.  While one of our bosses raved about it (it's one of his favorite spots), I found it to be only close to as good as most down south pancake/waffle houses.   I personally found my corned beef hash to have way too much onion (it shouldnt overpower the corned beef hash, nor have that crunch oniony consistency).  However, my pancakes and other breakfast essentials were quite edible.  Would I go here again? Not if I could test something else."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot!  Pancakes and the Dutch baby are amazing.  Lots of options and amazing pancake choices.  This place is always hopping so do yourself a favor and add yourself to the wait list on Yelp or the Nowait app ahead of time."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in the South Park area! The prices are reasonable too. I love their chocolate chip pancakes, and their coffee is way better than your typical breakfast diner cup'o'jo. The waitress was accommodating and tentative. Just know that when you get their \"hash browns\" it's not the shredded potato strings that you would expect when ordering your usual hash browns. They are more like peasant potato wedges. Still good, just not what you would expect. Also the wait on Saturday and Sunday mornings ranges from 15 to 45 min and you cannot call ahead and make reservations. But you can put your name in and go walk around to the other nearby shops. They give you a text notification when they are ready to seat your party."}
{"text":"They have these in the South Bay where I grew up, so I was very pleased to find them in Las Vegas, also. I love the apple pancakes and the has is very good, too. In fact, everything here is good. Not to mention, you should head over to the Green Valley Ranch Hotel and Casino any way. Its a little bit of a sleeper, being away from the strip but all the cool locals hang out here when they aren't at the Hard Rock."}
{"text":"Still my go-to place for breakfast. Even on the holidays they are open. Service and food is always spot on. One of the few places in Vegas that is consistently great."}
{"text":"this breakfast place is located in a very unlikely location...the downstairs of a motel 6 near the fashion square mall...odd, right? well, do yourself a favor, grab some cash (because it's cash only, not because it's expensive!), and grab a table because this place does a good thing to breakfast foods...  my waffle selection was delightful...it wasn't as dough or big as typical waffles are done at breakfast places...instead it was crisp and had a texture that was a cross between a pancake and almost like a chip...odd, right? perhaps, but oooooooooooooh was it yummy!    best way to go about it? get a bunch of people, each order a different plate, get bites of each and share a side of bacon...(oh, and then go shopping at fashion square!)"}
{"text":"I love their pancakes, omelettes, and the hash browns-mmmmm.  I still can't believe that someone can make an omelette the size of my head.  But, I do not love this location.  This is by far the best 'chain' to go to in town, but go to the one in South Park.  The people that work here are incompetent and I am not just reviewing one occasion.  Every time I go, whether I eat there or take it to go, they screw something up or are just plain slow.  And there's something off with the vibe of this place.  It doesn't feel comfortable like the other restaurant.  I only go to this one because it's closer.  If I'm out, I head over to the other one.  I even think the food is fresher at the other one.  5 stars for the one in South Park though.  **Update** Again they screwed something up.  How do you forget to give a person butter for pancakes and then, after reminding them 3 times that you need butter, still manage to never get it?"}
{"text":"Long waits for decent food. Might be worth it for something beyond just eggs and toast. There is a wide variety of special items on the menu."}
{"text":"Pancake House is the perfect casual weekend breakfast location. Go early to avoid waiting for a table. Everyone is so friendly and they make sure your coffee cup is always full. I always order the oven baked omelet which is enormous and delicious! Good price for the portion of food. Must pay with cash or check. If you only have plastic, they have an ATM machine inside. Yum!"}
{"text":"Probably the BEST pancakes that I've ever had. I got the chocolate chip pancakes with bananas on it as the side of my scrambler. The scrambler was too wet and nothing to write home about, but the pancakes were the real star of the show and made up for all of it. We were seated quickly and in and out efficiently."}
{"text":"The bran pancakes with a side of strawberries.  I know it sounds super healthy (not tasty) but man these are good-I crave them on a regular basis.   I love the atmosphere, homey, good food, can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place is UNDEFEATED for pancakes. My boyfriend is a waffle fanatic and he holds them up there with the best waffles. The portions are generous, the prices are right and the food is ALWAYS perfect. No frills, just excellent breakfast. Only downside is the wait (which is usually a good sign). It's a popular place so on a Saturday/Sunday you need to get there early or prepare for a 30 minute wait."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Champaign and I was happy because the city has OPH."}
{"text":"As advertised this place definitely has a good variety of pancakes.  I had the pumpkin pancakes today and they seem like they needed a pinch more sugar or cinnamon.  I've had them before and remembered them being pretty good, but today's batch was just lacking a little.  I also had some bacon to go with them.  Normally bacon is pretty much bacon at most places, but these were some nice slices of bacon and cooked just right.  Definitely a spot to come back to."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast and even better service!  Pigs in a blanket, Apple Pancake, Eggs and hash browns."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast spot for when you just want a traditional breakfast. Went on a Friday morning and had great service! Love their coffee mugs.   The pancakes home fries were both great. I was a little disappointed in the lack of breakfast combos, but the food was good!"}
{"text":"O M G...best pecan pancakes and side of potatoes!!! Oh and the biscuit and gravy is amazing as well! If you have not gone--go! ASAP! The service is fast and very friendly folks everywhere. My coffee cup was never empty! Cute little place by Motel 6 and Fashion Square mall. You still sitting there? Go I said!"}
{"text":"Is this the original pancake house? I seem to recall one on South Boulevard that proceeded this one. And perhaps at least one more. But regardless of that claim, it is certainly a decent spot for a solid breakfast - unfortunately we don't get out for breakfast often, and if we do, it is rarely to the South Park area.  The good news is that you don't have to get there for breakfast, as they are actually open into the evening, just make sure you don't head by for a late night meal, as they do close somewhat early (about 9pm if memory serves).  One thing to be sure of: Make sure you're looking for some pancakes, as they have plenty of choices, and you'll be able to find something you're sure to like. Definitely worth a visit if that's your fancy."}
{"text":"I come here once a week on my day off and they never cease to amaze me. This visit I decided to use a Groupon voucher, and it clearly states dine-in only, however they let me order to go... I've been feeling a little under the weather so it was SO convenient."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. It feels like home, no matter how busy it gets. Ask for Jesse. You can settle back and experience quality food, service & a great vibe."}
{"text":"Great service.  Even when the place is packed!  Ate on a Tuesday morning at 7:30 and had the Swedish pancakes.  Delish except no Loganberries:(. The very best breakfast place in CU and has been for MANY years:)"}
{"text":"Often on weekends (usually rainy weekends for some reason) I find myself craving this place. Saturdays are really packed here so we try to go on Sundays, while most people are at church. That almost always guarantees a parking spot and no wait.  My absolute favorite thing here are the pecan pancakes with powdered sugar. I'm always a little disappointed to eat the lower most pancake of the stack since it has little or no powdered sugar. I hope they will remedy that some day. Their waffles are good as well, but I don't remember what kind I had ordered. Most likely pecan waffles.  I have tried their omelets before which are decent. The fajita crepes are pretty good, but the potato pancakes are not quite the way we've had them before. What particularly annoys me is their coffee. It is substandard, almost watery, every time we go here, but still somehow costs more than a tall coffee at Starbucks. Every time I realize this and decide I won't order coffee here next time and yet every time I forget it and order it again. Good thing my boyfriend has a habit of checking my Yelp reviews before we go to a place to see what we like and what we don't, so now that I have mentioned that, hopefully I won't be ordering any more coffee here."}
{"text":"I always see people standing outside waiting for a table so I knew it had to be good. We didn't wait long. Sweet tea was good. I got the crepe. It was my first crepe ever. It was good and flavorful and light and fluffy at the same time. My fiance got the pancakes and he loved them. Service was good and attentive for how busy they were. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite breakfast restaurant when I am in Scottsdale, AZ as well as my families favorite.   Recommend the Fantastic Dutch Baby, strawberry waffles, Potato Pancakes, blueberry pancakes, crepes and great oven-finished veggie omelettes. .. and the list goes on!  A 1950's retro diner that is part of the Original Pancake House chain although Ron the owner has always taken pride in providing exceptional quality food and unique original consistent recipes for over 25 years as one of the original locations. Highly recommend. Can be busy on weekends although always worth the wait.    Diners, Drive-Ins and dives should visit this place soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite place to go for breakfast! The staff is always great! They always remember us, especially our daughter, which she loves!  I love the dutch baby, the 49er flap jacks, corned beef and hash, and the list goes on!"}
{"text":"We ate here this morning. While the coffee was OK, the OJ was great! But that is where it stops. My Pancakes were half raw, eggs overdone. My husband didn't finish his meal either, he only ate his bacon because his eggs were so dry and his pancakes were raw. Service was good.  I wouldn't recommend this place. Over priced."}
{"text":"Definitely make this a stop if you are in or passing through Charlotte, NC. We went for a Sunday morning meet up with our close friends before we left town. It was an excellent experience because the food was delicious, service wasn't anything special, but it was immediate when we sat down. And the price was fair! I cannot wait to come back here.  There was a long wait before we were seated, but it was worth it. We waited about 45 minutes to an hour, and then were seated at a clean table. Service was friendly and actually quick. The menu is expansive and reminds me of a cross breed of IHOP and Waffle House.  The only part that was tough was the parking. I almost gave up on parking here and going here, but there were cars moving right when we arrived and we lucked up!"}
{"text":"Another first! And this place was hopping. It was packed and we were like let's just see how long! 15 min wait and boom. We were in, yes it was that fast.  We sat down and more people were coming and going! They we very busy.  Anyway, we had the best waitress we could get. She was a sweetheart! And good at what she does. Then the food came out and it was off the hook good. Price wasn't bad either. I would recommend this place if your ever in Charlotte NC! Dam it was good."}
{"text":"Read  the reviews as I always like to do and the place surely did not disappoint! I had the Eggs Michael - poached eggs over two sausage patties sitting on a toasted english muffin smothered with a delicious mushroom sherry sauce with potato pancakes with apple sauce dressing which were fabulous! The place has a modern industrial design with lots of high windows which makes it nice and bright to wake you up in the morning. The staff was friendly and attentive. I thought the price was reasonable for the amount of food we received. You will not leave hungry! We certainly will be back again. This was the Charlottetowne Ave location!"}
{"text":"Wow! Service was on point. Everyone from the girl seating us to Bertha our server. The pancakes were so amazing! I loved the sourdough used & how light & fluffy they were. The portions are huge & I couldn't finish my omelette WHICH I hated to do! 2 of us ate for around $30 & included a HUGE omelette, 3 pancakes & coffee EACH.   I also need to mention the coffee was delicious too. I mean I drank it black & normally I need a ton of cream & sugar.   I really loved the atmosphere of the place & how authentic it felt to the old school pancake houses. It was super clean & didn't feel run down at all. Everything from the color scheme to the Formica tables. I felt like a kid again!   I was surprised to find it's a chain & will be hunting out the next location!   Thank you for feeding my belly!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, short wait times, and phenomenal food. Our server was great, she suggested the potato pancakes so I got them with the eggs Benedict with veggies. Everything was delicious, English muffin perfectly toasted and buttered. My friend got the cinnamon oatmeal raisin pancakes and I'm positive I will never have better pancakes in my life, they were THAT GOOD. Make sure you get a glass of fresh oj, it's worth it."}
{"text":"By far my favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix/Scottadale. Adorable tiny little neighborhood spot with great food! Have tried the apple pancake, salami and eggs, dutch baby, and sourdough pancakes, all which were amazing. Be prepared for a wait though, this place is packed on the weekends - and if you decide to try the apple pancake or Dutch baby they take about 45 min but are well worth the wait. They are both a little piece of heaven in your mouth. The salami and eggs (and most of their other egg dishes) are also a real treat as they are baked which makes them fluffy and delicious!!! Be sure to give this place a try if you're in the area!!!"}
{"text":"If you don't mind a wait in the morning, it's by far the best place for breakfast in champaign. The best pancakes around for sure!"}
{"text":"Admittedly, I've been to several OPH's around the country, and while each franchise seems to have a lot of leeway in altering their menu or decorating as they see fit, across the board I think this is the type of restaurant you can't truly appreciate until you've become a regular at one of them.  Many are family owned and have become neighborhood institutions.  This particular branch derives a certain amount of \"charm\" from its attachment to a Motel 8, walls that have been collecting grime and signatures from celebrities for years, and newer solid surfacing table and countertops that are rainbow flecked, perhaps to coordinate with the teal paint details?  The angry \"turn your cell phones off\" signs have an air of authority that demand that the customers respect the wait staff.  The menu here mirrors most in the franchise (enormous apple pancake, oven baked dutch baby, a variety of breakfast crepes, traditional - ie, non-Belgian - waffle, fat oven baked omelets and a wide variety of pancakes), and additionally offers a few egg scramblers and daily specials.  I'll point out that I LOVE 49ers, and was disappointed that they came slightly crispy fried here, similar to a potato pancake.  I'm sure they'd be fine if I had nothing to compare them to.  I wouldn't necessarily make a special trip here, but if you live in the area and can dedicate yourself to becoming a weekend fixture and working your way through the menu, do it.  Oh!  They have take-out here too!"}
{"text":"I love the pancake house.  Love it love it love it.  In Madison, there is no equal.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  The omelets are four eggs, fluffy and baked, and probably larger than your face.  For a small upcharge, you can swap out the buttermilk pancakes on the side with any of the other specialty cakes.  I'd highly recommend the wheat germ pancakes (hearty and slightly sweet) or the 49er flapjacks (flat like a crepe, but doughier, and well, gooey).  All of their crepes are divine, and if you don't mind waiting a little longer, their oven-baked pancakes (the signature dutch baby and apple pancake) are phenomenal.  With Brennan's across the street, they often purchase fresh fruit in the summer for daily specials - keep an eye out for anything they create with fresh peaches.  The weekend wait is worth it.  You can get in quickly on weekday mornings for a fast bowl of oatmeal with brown sugar and cream.  Oh, be forewarned - the coffee is only for those with strong stomachs.  Family owned and run, with servers who have been working there for years, if you come here often enough they'll soon learn your name, how you like your eggs, and if you're lucky, they'll provide you service with a hug."}
{"text":"Good times with family and friends.  In the Motel 6 where the kids stayed for the wedding, so very convenient.  Near great shopping."}
{"text":"I have seen this old looking spot as long as I have lived here. Drive by it almost every day. Finally we go in. Unfortunately they didnt have what I have been craving for the last 2 weeks, and after going out for breakfast too darn often for the last couple weeks not much is impressing me anymore. Until today. yes the place looks dated, but it was clean. The wait staff was very attentive & efficient. This food was GOOD. Very good. & my friend, swears we a re going back again. The pancakes were unlike any other either of us have had. I love finding these little treasures of places."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre. The food didn't taste like it was anything to die for. The bacon pancakes were a nice addition, however, I would still choose MiMi's cafe or even Denny's over this breakfast venue."}
{"text":"First time at this location! It's a busy Friday morning but we were seated within ten minutes. Jessica our server was very diligent. Their menu is huge and have many speciality pancakes. I really enjoyed my pumpkin pancakes (I was so excited because these are usually seasonal) and the grapefruits. Everyone's food at the table was delicious. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Strongly recommend. It is a nice place for family to spend their weekend morning. Food is really nice. What needs to recommend is its coffee, not the best, but better than most restaurants."}
{"text":"I definitely prefer this place to the big chains like IHOP. it's very straightforward here with the buttermilk pancakes, eggs, meat type of stuff for breakfast. If you're vegetarian, there's not a whole ton for you. I wouldn't mind seeing some more options that aren't littered in animal proteins, but hey, I'm just happy there's buckwheat. I will eat buckwheat all day.   Coffee - weak, but hot and plentiful Food - gets the job done Buckwheat - YEAH BABY Fruit - Meh Toppings - They have lingonberries! Yum!  This is a good place to come if you are one of those people who can't figure out what you want. You can literally piecemeal your entire order. Do it. And come early on the weekend or expect a big wait."}
{"text":"This place has been around for ever, and it just gets better and better. We dined here on a Sunday morning, fairly early, trying to beat the church crowd. When w got there, there was a wait. They told us 15 minutes, but it was more like 5, which is always a pleasant surprise.   I ordered the strawberry pancakes, which is 6 pancakes, fresh strawberries, whipped cream and warm strawberry syrup. I also had a side of bacon. My husband had 2 eggs, fried, with bacon and an order of three pancakes. Both of our meals were wonderful! The pancakes are smaller than what you get at IHOP, but so, SO much better. They're light, fluffy, and delicious. The strawberries were super sweet on their own, and between those, the whipped cream and the dusting of powdered sugar, you don't need much syrup. But add some anyways ;)  The bacon was thick cut and delicious.   The service was quick, our server was friendly and efficient. This is definitely a favorite spot for breakfast in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Q: Where can you find...church goers, hungover peeps, masses of kids and some of the quickest, delicious breakfast in all of Charlotte?   A: Original Pancake House  Yup, it's a smorgasbord of hungry folks and it's tasty. And yes, it's a chain, but I can't help but express my love for this particular OPH. If you're looking for breakfast, early in the mornin' or late in the afternoon, I highly recommend dropping by here. If you make this particular breakfast run on a Sunday, be prepared to run into a line of hungry folks. But it's ok, really - don't you fear. A very long line absolutely flies into the restaurant in lighting quick speed. I don't know how many cooks OPH has working, but those guys/gals are really, really fast. Thus the tables turn really, really quickly.   No joke, as soon as hubs and I are seated we are out of there in 30-40 minutes at the longest. I usually order the French Crepes - perfectly cooked, delicious, thin crepes stuffed with fresh strawberries accompanied by a side of strawberry sauce. I typically order only two as the regular order comes with three and I just can't handle that much delectable goodness. Make sure you try the turkey sausage too - it's pretty amazing.   If you're more of an omelet fan, OPH makes them the size of footballs. They.are.huge. Oh, and they come with a side of pancakes, so be sure to come hungry. This particular joint is a staple for me as I'm always craving those damn crepes. Thanks, OPH!"}
{"text":"Warning: ONLY ACCEPTS CASH OR CHECK. I didn't realize this until i sat down. Good thing i had my debit card, but wasnt too happy about getting charged $2 to take out money from the ATM. At least I know for next time though...I have actually been wanting to try this place out for years, but haven't had the chance to until today because of the limited hours they are open (when I first wanted to try them out, I think they were only open Thursday-Sunday). I was pretty excited to try them out, but wasn't super impressed. We had to wait a while to be seated, but I understand that since we were coming in at 10:45 in the morning on a Sunday). They served their food on non-disposable plastic plates and to be honest, it didn't look all that appetizing. For the price, I thought the quality could have been better. (I got the asparagus omelette with bacon added to it) and I thought it was lacking flavor. I did try a bite of my sister's plate (Tex Mex) and I thought that was pretty good. Not sure if I will go back in the future though."}
{"text":"Best place for pancakes! This place is highly popular! The staff is friendly and the place is clean. Cannot wait until I return and try more of their menu items.  The decorations are nice and traditional to breakfast places."}
{"text":"Husbands choice- Hun lets go to this original pancake house in Scottsdale your gonna like it! Okay, Let's go! As we were driving towards the fashion mall we were pulling up on the side of Motel 6. I told my husband \"ugghhh where we going? Why are we here?\" Lol.. He says no Hun the restaurant is inside trust me! Lol, ok.. We came inside the restaurant and was greeted immediately but, their nice hostess and the service was nice. The breakfast brunch was not bad at all it was really good tooo good I wanted to go back home and go back to sleep! Lol..."}
{"text":"Too expen$$$ive for breakfast.  Pancakes are pretty good.  I've had better.  Their hash browns are excellent, but $5 for some hash browns and cheese.  Ouch.... The options on the menu are somewhat limited.  Most breakfast places have an option for something with eggs, hash browns, pancakes/french toast, and meat.  It seems like you have to order everything separately here.  The sausage was good, not great.  The orange juice was definitely fresh squeezed.  It should be more like $$ for price.  There were 2 of us and when we were done, our bill was over $30.  Definitely not a cheap place to eat breakfast (which should be the cheapest meal of the day)."}
{"text":"Original Pancake House has always had really great food. I truly do think this is one of the best places if you just trying to get some good breakfast food without any drama. I have always gone with Family every Sunday for Brunch and it gets packed but the wait is worth every bit."}
{"text":"Ok idk what happened yesterday but the pancakes were dry and unflavorful and the eggs were meh. Even the coffee was subpar. I have always preferred this place over other pancake houses but after yesterday I am still craving good pancakes cuz we both did not get good ones yesterday. There was a sign as we walked in they were hiring a busser. Perhaps they should change that to cook. Won't rush back"}
{"text":"Their hours are too short. open only till around 2. But they have the largest selection of pancakes. A lot you can't find at Ihop."}
{"text":"Being a big Laguna Hills OHOP fan, I was disappointed when I visited the Scottsdale AZ location. It felt like a completely different restaurant.  First off--cash only. Wasn't ready for that. Luckily, they have an ATM onsite.  Secondly, they really nerfed the size of the Dutch Baby here. I worked up my friends at how awesome and overwhelmingly large the Dutch Baby is (and that you could share it with two people), but it was a disappointment. It was bit dry, almost burnt and stale tasting.  Third, I felt very rushed. I know that there is a long line, but they were really pushy about cleaning up our plates immediately after we finished and it made for an uncomfortable eating experience.  All in all, there is little to distinguish this place from an IHOP."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for breakfast in Champaign.  Unfortunately, it's just about everyone else's go-to place also, because it's good and we have a lack of good places in the area.  If you come on weekdays the crowd is substantially less, but even today (Friday late morning) it was still pretty crowded with a short wait for a table of four.  Weekends you'd better be an early riser, or like eating breakfast late, because it's consistently crowded with full waiting room + groups sitting outside the door.  My favorite is the Farmer's Omelette.  It's sausage, cheese, mushrooms, red peppers, green peppers, onions and it's a pretty big omelet.  It comes with 3 pancakes as well, so the usual plan is eat the pancakes and about half the omelet, and take the rest home.  It runs about $12, so all in all you end up getting 1.5 - 2 meals out of it, depending on your appetite.  My wife frequently gets the Ham and Cheese Omelette and she says it's very good.  My girls like the bacon pancakes and the chocolate chip pancakes.  The chocolate chip pancakes come with whipped cream and chocolate drizzle, so it's more like a dessert than a breakfast.  They have fresh squeezed orange juice, but that's the source of my \"minus 1 star.\"  The quality varies, and a large OJ is $5.  It's usually pretty good, but that's Las Vegas/Chicago pricing folks.   Today the juice was pretty weak, so that made the price thing gnaw at me even more.   Today our two omelette meals (my youngest split one with my wife), a chocolate chip pancakes, 2 large juice, 1 large chocolate milk (large ~= 12 oz), and a coffee ran us $46+tip.   That's pretty steep for breakfast, considering that about $15 of that was just drinks alone.  We have a lack of good choices for sit-down breakfast in the area.  Even with the mentioned beverage price issues, it's still the best choice in the area that we've found so far."}
{"text":"Really better than IHOP, completely different recipe...more homemade, like what Mom used to make. I had the Banana pancakes, huge portion. Half portions available too. But no Wi-Fi to post this review."}
{"text":"I have never seen this place less than full during any hour of the day. Considered one of the gems of Champaign, the Original House of Pancakes by no doubt triumphs any other breakfast joints in the area. My family and I have been in here a myriad amount of times, and each time we had spectacular customer service despite their overwhelming amounts of customers. One can expect to wait approximately 15-30 minutes before being seated, but I can promise that the wait will be worth it. The food is unimaginably godly(not even kidding) and are portioned generously. Each plate that you order will be guaranteed to make your mouth water no matter what. The waffles in particular always taste shockingly aphrodisiac and are certainly Instagram worthy. This place is a must visit for any habitants or visitors of Champaign, and rest assured that this place will be sure to bedazzle your taste buds and give you an unforgettable breakfast."}
{"text":"Got the Georgia pecan pancakes with scrambled eggs and sausage links.  Everything was very good and John was very helpful and on top of our drinks!  Would return."}
{"text":"Always the best!  Great food, service, and atmosphere!  We've been coming in here for 20 years and it is consistently fabulous!  I love their specials of the day and the pancakes are obviously out of this world."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I have eaten at a Original Pancake House ever since the Charleston and Decatur location burned down a couple of years ago. Even though it was a different location, I still got the same great food and service that I remembered.   I got a baked omelet with gouda, a side of potatoes, and a stack of pancakes that came with the omelete.  Everything came out the same time, hot, and tasted excellent. The omelet was stringy, and gooey with plenty of cheese. I asked for extra grilled onions with my potatoes and they delivered. The pancakes where fluffy and tender with good flavor.  My waitress, even without me ever asking, also made sure my drinks were always topped off, and dumped a pile of extra napkins on my table.  This place is really far from the location that I used to go to, but I will definitely make the trip for more awesome food and service."}
{"text":"Buttermilk pancakes are the bomb dot com!  Ok...that was cheesy, but seriously.  I never expected pancakes to taste that good.  Yea, the service is crappy and the decor could use some updating, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"The Apple Pancake is huge... too big for someone who often orders off the kids menu.  Generally, I don't think you can take home breakfast leftovers.  But our waitress said this pancake would hold up pretty well, and she suggested we pair it with vanilla ice cream at home.  Yum!"}
{"text":"You've been to one Original Pancake House, you've been to them all. Our waitress was fast and our food arrived quickly....what more could you ask for. This place is pretty far from my apartment so unless I'm in the area and haven't already had breakfast, I don't see a reason to make a special trip.  By the way, the are cash only."}
{"text":"After moving to Charlotte from Chicago, I thought I'd list the Original Pancake House forever. Then we stumbled upon this location. Food stood up to what i remembered.   If you're looking for the best most filling breakfast out there, I'd recommend the apple Pancake. It's less of a pancake and more of an apple pie. The flavors are incredible and you will undoubtedly have leftovers. Now if you're not looking for dessert for breakfast, my go to ate the  49ers. Very thin, chewy pancakes. Amazing.   Beware of the wait on weekends. You're usually looking at 30-60 minutes on average, and usually greater than that Sunday after church."}
{"text":"Great establishment , I've had this in Atlanta so i knew wgat to expect,  Only difference is the state i am in now was North Carolina. I ordered Western Omelette with Turkey instead of Ham, and it was humongous . I actually tried to finish it and was defeated lol   Somewhat friendly staff, I dont think they see as many young Men like me . Service was lightning fast though and food was piping hot ."}
{"text":"After a night of beers and mixed drinks, what better in the morning than a trip to the Original Pancake House? This was my first experience here, and when we pulled up I was about to pull right back ot of the parkin lot because there were people outside waiting for tables. The couple we were with assured us that this is normal and that they turn the tables over quickly. They were right; after about 10 minutes we were seated.   We've heard great things about the omelettes so that was the first place we looked on the menu. Even better was the fact that you get a short stack with your omelette. I chose the Spanish omelette while most others at the table ordered cheese omelettes, and when all of our orders came out I had immediate food envy. Everyone's omelettes looked like big, giant fluffy egg pillows of deliciousness, and mine was covered with some sort of mystery pasta gravy/salsa hybrid sauce. But I dug in, and it was delicous. The pancakes were soooooo good, and once you add their homemade butter and maple syrup, you have a recipe for 100% breakfast bliss. Eat here. Then go home and pass our for 3 hours, and don't expect to be hungry again until 7pm."}
{"text":"Perfectly seasoned potatoes, piping hot coffee, and scrambled egg whites were all fantastic. The perfect brunch"}
{"text":"The chocolate chip pancakes and bacon are my go to and always are delicious. The service is always fast and extremely friendly. I would recommend the fresh squeezed OJ. It's hard to go back to store bought once you have tried their fresh squeezed OJ."}
{"text":"Food was okay , staff was slow and our waitress messed up a lot. Good omelets but it sucks it comes with no sides. Overall this place was okay. Not sure if I would recommend."}
{"text":"I've gone to this Original Pancake House near the Metropolitan a few times now. I've only ever really gone after a night of drinking since I live nearly across the street from this location. The food is typically very average, it would be good cheap food, but the quality doesn't really reflect the price. Just a bit more than I care to pay for poor service and mediocre food.   The service is typically pretty poor. The waiter/waitress will disappear once you get your food without checking in on the table. I've had servers completely forget to bring the drinks that were ordered. Once I was delivered the wrong food, which meant for another table.  Recently, my credit card company emailed me telling me that I left a $50 tip on a $10 meal. So someone on the staff tried to change the tip I had left, which is generally just disappointing. But I guess it is an Original Pancake House and I can't really expect much more, so I'm just happy I have a good credit card company to warn me about these kind of issues."}
{"text":"This place used to be a four star breakfast but has gradually gone down hill.  The food is still ok but no longer stellar."}
{"text":"At last ive tried the historic ohop. Will be back and back again. Its hard to make eggs to my taste and they hit the nail on the head. Now that matties is gone ill be comming here for my breakfast fix."}
{"text":"Dude. Bad coffee? The hell you say. The coffee is GOOD, and they serve it with heavy cream! No wimpy half-n-half here.   This was actually the very first restaurant I went to in Champaign. I was nine. My family and I had just unloaded the moving truck and we went here for dinner (note: has not been open for dinner in many years, which is unfortunate). I had Hawaiian pancakes with Tropical Syrup. It seemed the height of exoticism. Breakfast at dinner! Tropical! Wow. I began to resent our move just a little bit less."}
{"text":"I had the Eggs Michael, I couldn't even swallow the food it was so awful.  I have never sent food back in my life but I gave it back after one bite. I would never tell anyone to eat here. The staff however was awesome"}
{"text":"As a franchise, this is a great place for breakfast. The menu is extensive, with pancakes in every shape and size being the feature. Portions are large, but there are options for half size plates. Everyone in our group of six enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"Love than pancakes and bacon here!  Fresh OJ!  Place is always busy on the weekends so come ready to wait!  But its worth it."}
{"text":"I am the omelet queen. Just ask my husband or any houseguest who has ever graced our doorstep. I make the meanest omelets just this side of heaven.  This place does it better.  Their baked omelets rock on so many levels that my drumsticks caught fire. (ok, I guess that only makes sense if you know I play the drums, my husband laughed until he snorted) The Irish is my favorite (says the ginger) - their corned beef is incredible.  Best of show: Fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. Pulpy, wonderful yumminess. So sweet that it makes oranges blush. They have fresh squeezed orange juice, too. Haven't tried it, but I'm sure it, too, embarrasses a lesser citrus.  Pancakes come with everything you order. I've never made it to the pancake course - even though they do look amazing. I pack them up and donate them to someone more gluten tolerant. Typically, the benefactors eat them like cookies right from the box, foregoing butter, syrup, or utensils, so they must be good.  I did try the potato pancakes this last round. Light and crispy, they're served with fresh, chunky apple sauce and sour cream. Uh-may-zing. I could hurt myself on these.  I have found the service efficient and friendly, whether we're the only customers or the place is hopping. Food is served quickly and piping hot. The portions are more than generous. Coffee flows freely, as it should. Lots of real cream.  The restaurant itself is immaculate and quantly decorated. Easy parking, too!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent customer service, and a quick turnaround time. When I came on a Saturday morning, there were so many people but I didn't have to wait very long. The prices are great, especially considering how much food you get. Their coffee was alright, but I've definitely had better from similar restaurants. Nice place, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Groupon in hand we came in through the doors to a packed dining room and waiting .. area.. Sunday morning, of course! Put my name on the waiting list and expected to have to wait at least 30 minutes and was pleasantly surprised when they called my name in less than 10 minutes! We were seated in a comfy booth in the far corner away from all the morning madness.   --Egg white vegetarian omelet with Gouda cheese... Seriously the largest omelet I have ever seen...!!!!They must use dinosaur eggs LOL Mine was nice, light and fluffy.  --I forgot what my bf got but it came with sausages, eggs, potatoes & pancakes.. Pretty standard but tasty. --Buttermilk Pancakes.. very Delicious.. melt in your mouth good!!! mmmm  Food alone I would give this place a 3 but our server, Dino, was just awesome!!! He kind of reminded me of Bruno Mars in a way haha He never let our coffee get empty and when i forgot to tell him I wanted egg whites he seriously ran to the kitchen to make sure that's what I got. He was very upbeat and on his A game!   HOT TIP: The omelets are oven baked so it takes approximately 18 minutes to cook so order it as soon as you sit down ;]]]"}
{"text":"Whoever the manager on duty is at your establishment is horrible. I have never been treated so poorly at a restaurant until now. He was rude from the moment we walked in the door. He pointed at dirty tables and told us to pick one. We found the only clean table in the restaurant and he brought over menus. Never greeted us and walked away. Every server walked right past us never acknowledged that they had a new customer in the empty restaurant. After waiting for no one to come over we got up and decided to leave. As we were walking out some guy shouted at us oh y'all are leaving? We said yes why would I spend my money at a restaurant who treats their customers like this. The manager stood at the host Stand and never once questioned why we were leaving. Quite frankly he didn't care if anyone left or stayed he was a complete rude person!"}
{"text":"We did eat here 4 days in a row, and everything was delicious.   I can recommend the grits,  Swedish pancakes, pecan waffle, Dutch baby, buckwheat pancakes, hash browns, and eggs any style.   It's crowded, but the wait is never long, and the service is very good.   It's lucky I don't live near here,  or I'd weigh 500 pounds!"}
{"text":"My absolutely favorite breakfast place...cannot go wrong!   The cherry kijafa crepes and mandarin orange crepes are killer, and when craving eggs I love getting their light and fluffy scrambled eggs loaded with diced ham.  We've never had anything but good friendly service there even if having to wait occasionally for seating during busier times. It is worth a wait!"}
{"text":"In my opinion  a hidden gem because most people don't know about this location.  Seated fast even on a packed Saturday. Food came out hot, cooked just right, and delicious! Would highly recommend when the craving for pancakes and waffles hits! Some of the best cornbeef hash in the area. YUM!"}
{"text":"During their business hours won't be going back to IHOP.    The parking is a bit tight and the crowd showed how good this place was. It was our first visit and looking at the menu we thought the prices were a little bit high, until we saw the plates come out. A good value for the dollar.  I had the limited time meat omelette.  The eggs it was made of were light and fluffy and was packed full of meat and cheese.  The pancakes were much better than the dense ones served at some other pancake places.  I highly recommend the warm strawberry syrup with the buttermilk pancakes.  Tasted like strawberry shortcake."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place, prices are relatively ok. The Apple pancake is awesome! Parking can be an issue but not impossible."}
{"text":"They burned my eggs.  I never had a place burn my eggs before.  The Original Pancake House is a VERY retro-looking restaurant attached to a Motel 6 in the middle of Scottsdale.  The place reminds me of the joints that my parents would take me to for breakfast when we were on vacation somewhere.  I'd order breakfast, it wouldn't be all that good, and I'd have a slightly upset stomach for the next hour while we were driving to our next destination.  The food here is mediocre at best.  I always order my eggs over hard when I'm eating out.  The ones here came with a brown crust and were obviously overcooked.  I tried my wife's and they were soaked in butter--not good--I could feel the old upset stomach coming on again. . .  The potatoes here are a horror that need  to be experienced in order to believe them.  One bite yields up a mouth bitter with onion, garlic, and grease--no potato to discern.  Pancakes, being that they are part of the name of this place, are the specialty of the House.  My wife ordered the Dutch Baby.  She thought it was decent.  It wasn't my taste--reminded me of solidified custard.  The regular pancakes overall were good, but I could have made something like them myself with a pan and a box of Bisquick.  There just wasn't anything here that I could say was distinctive about this place at all--no real reason to put it on my breakfast rotation.  It's got blah food and nice service.  No, I'll pass on this one."}
{"text":"Was excited to try based on reviews. Eggs benedict was good, they used a piece of ham instead of canadian bacon, eggs were a little over poached. Potato pancakes were a HUGE disappointment, it was like eating a fried egg with some potatoes mixed in. French toast was ok, not crispy enough for my liking but good flavor. Pancakes were good, better than ihop, even after we watched kitchen microwave them before bringing to table. Final verdict? Would come back for benedict, and to try good looking omelets we saw but won't make a special trip across town just for breakfast. Wasn't worth $30 for sure."}
{"text":"LOVE this place, food & service always consistent. Very attentive staff, pancake are like little mini cakes from heaven! Lol"}
{"text":"We've been to this long established restaurant many times.  The food is great,  the waitstaff is awesome.  The hostess is rude to the point that this will be our last time here.  Luckily we have many great choices for a nice breakfast dining experience."}
{"text":"Very nice local breakfast place !! Try to make it early in the morning. This place is in demand and hence long waiting. Its worth the wait though. Always wanted to go to OPH for breakfast. Went the last time 6 months back and returned because the wait time was about an hour. We were hungry so couldn't wait that long. This time reached around 8 and we were seated in 10 minutes. Awesome.  We tried the pecan waffles, extra crispy hash browns and veggie omelette..  Everything yummy.  Service was really good. Oh how can i forgot the freshly squeezed ORANGE juice. One interesting thing that i tried for the first time ever was the tropical sauce which was surprisingly tasty. it went great with the waffles. I would recommend it.  Very important: carry CASH or CHECK. There is an ATM inside but that would charge for the service. they do not accept any kind of debit/credit card."}
{"text":"Don't remember what I gave this place last time, but second time around, it's not as impressive as I may have once thought (?).    Ordered the Cobb salad with raspberry vinagrette and it was a pretty big salad--no way that I could finish it.  I think why I didn't think it was as good this time around was because there were a lot of people there on Sunday morning and I don't necessarily get the hype of the place.    The food is fairly average, but priced pretty good.  When things get hyped up too much, I generally dismiss it and places rarely ever live up to my expectation.  Will I come here again?  Probably, can't think of any other place that has the variety, price, and casual dining that this place has.  dmo out."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The Dutch baby is my favorite thing on the menu. We normally do the breakfast thing here. Although there may be a wait they get you in fast on the weekends. The owner/manager jumps right in and helps his staff out a lot."}
{"text":"Wasn't the best experience.  The waitress was extremely slow.  Four tables that were seated at least twenty minutes after us were served and left before us. I ordered the French toast and it was soggy."}
{"text":"Service was a little weird. The restaurant wasn't very busy yet they barely ever checked on us. But the food was fantastic and they were still very nice people!"}
{"text":"It was an okay dining experience. I was expecting something more I guess after getting referred by an article stating they had one of the best pancakes in the valley. I ordered the pancake which was featured in the article called the apple pancake. I guess it was ok. I ordered the junior size and only ate about a third because it was really sweet. The kids had a bacon waffle which they liked, but it didn't seem like it was anything special. The bussers were really nice, but the waitress just seemed irritated that we were there. I probably wont go back but it wasn't too terrible."}
{"text":"Having lived in NW Oregon most of my life -- coming to this location was a bit different than their Oregon ones.  The food quality was not up to par, but it wasn't bad food...just different.  Don't get me wrong, this is my favorite breakfast place in the world -- seriously -- amazing food.  The prices were lower here than in Oregon.  The location itself is just off Charleston, and you might miss it if you're speeding like everyone else.  Once inside, it feels older and non-welcoming.  It is VERY LOUD inside, as we were practically YELLING to even speak, lol.  Oh well.  Since they closed their Cheyenne location -- you have to go this one on, if you live on the west side of town...but its worth the drive...so go go go!"}
{"text":"I give this establishment a neutral review, went over the weekend had breakfast which was very good but the prices are quite expensive. Breakfast for two was almost $50 which was quite expensive. Service was good but the cost and the amount of time it took to get my food did not leave me highly impressed."}
{"text":"Great food and service portions are perfect for the breakfast lover. The fajita crape is amazing"}
{"text":"Every time we're in Vegas we always stop here for breakfast. Their pancakes are fluffy and delicious! I've had the German pancake which is HUGE and covered with butter, lemon and dusted with powdered sugar. (It hangs over the edge of the plate it's so big.) Their omelets are really good also, from the ham and cheese to the mushroom and spinach covered with jack cheese. Crepes are perfect and go great with the potato pancakes with sour cream. Staff is like family, very friendly and welcoming. From what I remember they close at 2PM."}
{"text":"Busy as heck, food was ok. 20 to 25 is what the wait person told everyone that walked in the door while 60 min later they kept say 10 more minutes we rode it out to see how attentive they would be.  The waitress was great but because they put a rush on the food they left it undercooked.  I won't be back the hostess had to keep going to the manager to see where snd how she could seat us."}
{"text":"Good stuff. You can't go wrong at The Original Pancake House. Come in ,sit down,make a choice and ENJOY!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. We visit Las Vegas several times a year, and we wanted to find good pancakes at a reasonable price, which meant off the Strip. Now my wife is addicted and we must stop whenever in town. Her favorite: Chocolate Chip pancakes. My favorite: Strawberry pancakes, and bacon. The prices are reasonable, portions are big, and service is friendly and quick. Since this is a franchise, you can check your area for one, but from our experience the prices and service vary.  We enjoy their awesome pancakes so much, we hunted online and found what is supposedly their recipe so we can enjoy them when 300 miles away in Phoenix. Ours don't come out as good, but it's definitely better than local restaurants or Bisquick!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad I had to give an OPH 3-stars, because I want to love it. The Las Vegas location is phenomenal, and after experiencing it, the Scottsdale location doesn't live up to our expectations. The pancakes taste the same (excellent), and some of their daily specials are obviously targeted to local tastes (and prices to local income levels), but it's a total dive. Attached to a Motel 6, it is easy to miss and isn't ritzy like the nearby restaurants at the Fashion Square.   There are \"NO Cell Phone\" signs posted everywhere, and we hear they are strictly enforced, though we haven't had any problems on our visits. The policy seems a bit dated and draconian. Additionally, your soda choices clearly reflect the personal taste of the owner - Pepsi or Diet Coke, only in cans. No fountains, no refills. Coffee is good (and bottomless), but getting extra half-and-half feels like pulling teeth if you like your coffee light.   We've been several times because my wife is addicted, but I could skip it and the 46 mile round trip from Gilbert. The first time we went, we were surprised at the surcharge for items included on the Las Vegas menu (such as whipped cream for chocolate chip pancakes), and the a la carte nature of the Scottsdale menu. Another time the waitress got our order wrong and argued with us instead of fixing it right away.   CASH ONLY. Keep that in mind before going. If you've never been to an OPH you will be blown away by the \"awesome pancakes\" (says my wife), but if you have been to any other location, you will probably be disappointed with the service and prices."}
{"text":"Their breakfast is very good and they have fresh squeezed orange juice. 4 stars because the foods are a little bit too oily"}
{"text":"One thing that the strip is lacking is quality traditional breakfast food at a reasonable price. So if you're visiting Vegas put OPH in your gps and discover what the locals already know, it's one of the best breakfast restaurants in Vegas.  No, it's not unique, in fact it's a franchise, but that doesn't change the fact that it's good. Try the potato pancakes with apple sauce, or the banana pancakes with strawberries! There are a million pancake variations to tempt every palate. And if you don't feel like pancakes they have a variety of other great breakfast fare including omelettes, crepes, and waffles.   Bottom line: good service, great food, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We were told that the wait was only 15-20 minutes and we ended up waiting for 45 minutes!!! We were all just waiting there while others that just arrived passed us by. I finally decided to complain and that's when they finally put their heads together and set-up a table for us. Worst place for a Sunday Brunch! Food was ok...not worth the wait."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast or brunch spots in Charlotte, menu is vast, service is fast and food is bountiful as well as yummy."}
{"text":"Very yummy breakfasts and exceptionally nice wait staff. The wait is long but organized and it is because the food and service is so good. I recommend the veggie scramble with potatoes added. Come hungry because the portions are big and accompanied by pancakes. My only complaint is they need bigger water glasses for us non-coffee drinkers. This is the place to go in town for breakfast."}
{"text":"I know this is a chain, but I've only ever been to this location, so this is a review for this specific location (as it should be). I LOVE their pancakes. Never had any better in my life; not even close. I always get the buttermilk pancakes. The orange juice is heavenly, although occasionally it seems more watered-down than usual. But even in its watered down state, it beats most I've had.   Lived here during college and every time I return to visit, I have to eat breakfast at Original Pancake House. It's always packed, but the 'line' moves fast."}
{"text":"As always the constant one...ever since we ate at this  restaurant  back in L.A.  it is our family favorite  Eggs Benedict with my sourdough pancakes my go to...also Dutch baby pancakes Awesome!!!! Service is always attentive"}
{"text":"Time for breakfast.  Had pancakes and 7 slices of thick bacon, I'm in heaven!!!  The service was fast, establishment was very clean."}
{"text":"We used to eat at the original location and when that was burned and hasn't been rebuild and the one in Aliante was gone, I thought they were no longer. I was happy to find that this location is alive and well. I think I like this one better as the old one was a bit run down, duct tape on the seats type of thing.  I came with my MIL for breakfast.   She got the dutch baby and a side of bacon. We make the dutch pancakes at home and while theirs is decent, it's a bit thick here and we prefer the thinner style we do at home and I load mine up with delicious berries. Still good though. Where they get you is the side of something savory to balance out the sweet pancakes as the bacon was almost $5 for 4 strips. However, those were really good quality thick sliced bacon.   I got the Venicia benedict which has ham, mushrooms, spinach and bacon. All the toppings were awesome and the eggs were perfectly poached and runny. The kicker is instead of breakfast potatoes, these come with potato pancakes! I love them and don't see them often enough of menus.   Portions here are pretty hefty. If you got a appetite, you will leave here happy I think.   Service was pretty decent and personable. Our drinks were refilled in a timely manner, we were checked on and chit chatted with our server. The hostess and cashier were fairly friendly as well.   I'm glad that the Original Pancake House is still around. I think their breakfasts have always been good. I will be back pretty soon with the Fiance."}
{"text":"Was going to attempt to go this weekend but found out yesterday from the one on Fort Apache that this one is CLOSED."}
{"text":"Great place. Was there for breakfast when they opened at 6:30am. Staff was very friendly and the food was good. I would eat here again if I lived close by. Had to take someone to the airport early then waited for them to open. Choose this over some others because my daughter is a vegan and they had something on the menu she could eat. She got the oatmeal with raisins and nuts. I had the Belgian waffle with a side of grits while my wife ordered a ham and cheese sandwich with hash brown potatoes. There potatoes were big chunks fried. I don't call these hash browns and I am not too fond of then this way."}
{"text":"We will NEVER be back. I'm only giving it two stars cause our server was wonderful, but without good food, the service doesn't mean too much.  My man ordered the chicken crepe. Sounds good in theory, until it came out, and it looked like a soupy mess! So much flavorless liquid, it was totally disgusting. Whatever liquid (think like chicken pot pie soup, but without any flavor) made the crepe slimy and gooey, and not appetizing.   I ordered corned beef hash, and it was too salty, tasted un-cooked and really chewy. It resembled dog food/asphalt.   Both of our came with their \"famous\" potato pancakes, and I think they should be \"famous\" for being horrible. No flavor, and VERY greasy!! Needed salt, or ketchup to make them edible. It came with a little cup of apple sauce, which happened to be the most flavorful item we received. Too bad it was supposed to be a condiment.   Seriously, we have NEVER had such a horrible breakfast in Las Vegas. Please save yourself some money and go somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot!! The crepes are sooo good and the bacon!! They have specials which are very good too. You are seated with basic breakfast menu. The staff is very friendly. This place tends to get very crowded."}
{"text":"Went to bkfst with another couple. The service was great, the place was nice and clean.  Coffee was just ok and was never hot, just warm.  I ordered a spinach omelette with gouda cheese and substituted the buttermilk pancakes that came with it for their buckwheat pancakes.  When my order arrived my first thought was HOLY COW! Who did they think they were feeding.  The omelette was HUGE. I am quite happy with a typical 3 egg omelete but this had to be a minimum of 6 eggs.  It was very yummy and loaded with lots of spinach and cheese.  I also LOVED the pancakes.    The reason I didn't give it 4 stars is simple..  Breakfast was $11 + coffee  and I made this same comment about Big Bear Diner.... The portion was huge and yes it was good but it's NOT necessary.  I'd rather have a smaller/more regular portioned size omelette and have a choice of sausage or bacon served with it and hashbrowns and of course a small side order of pancakes for the same price.  I enjoy the basic variety/package that is common for breakfast.  Not just 1 huge main item and no side items.    Would I go back, eh probably.. But for the same price I can get a good bkfst at ihop, dennys and blueberry hill and get a more varied bkfst."}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast places! !! There are about 5 we go between here in town but what wins this place for me the most is the service!  Bravo to whomever is in charge of hiring this wonderful staff and keeping them happy! We have never had a bad meal or bad service here :)"}
{"text":"I have been getting the potato pancakes here for over 15 years and that recipe is exactly the same and it's spectacular."}
{"text":"Diner style pancakes which is good.. I actually like it better than ihop simply because they have so many different types of pancakes! we had the raisin and bran pancake and the Cherry Kijafa Crepes.. the pancakes were amazing with the berry syrup.. the crepes while perfect in flavor were very very sweet..  that was a kill for me since the cherries went perfect with the crepes; i just wish there was less syrup on it.."}
{"text":"I was in today and I had a lady named Starla and she was amazing. I am not a big breakfast person and she recommended me the Philly cheesesteak which is amazing. She was at every needs we needed. I'll be seeing her soon."}
{"text":"Pretty good, it's basic. It's nothing to go flipping over but it will satisfy any breakfast craving you may have. What I do like is the prompt seating. Even if the place is packed you will be seated fast and that's remarkable especially for my large family of six!"}
{"text":"The chocolate chip pancakes without whip cream was great. The real pure maple syrup is 10/10. The Oven Baked Meat Lovers omelette was absolutely amazing. The Santa Fe omelette was delicious (the jalapeño in it was very hot) and even the regular plain pancakes were equally delicious. All portions were huge and the food was tasty. The coffee was very good. The orange juice is freshly squeezed and has a natural taste. The environment is friendly, as well as friendly wait staff. The parking is also fine."}
{"text":"A sturdy breakfast place, full of pancake choices and good, solid egg dishes.  I came here twice while in Charlotte for work.    First time, I had the corned beef hash and eggs over medium with the sourdough pancakes.  The hash was great -- real chunky pieces of the corned beef proved that it was a good homemade one.  The eggs were not exactly over-medium (more like over easy -- a little too runny for my tastes).  The sourdough pancakes were chewy and a little overdone, but pretty good when drizzled with their orange marmalade syrup thing.    Second time, I had the egg white veggie omelette with cheddar cheese and a side of potato pancakes.  (Can you tell I'm not a fan of the sweet breakfasts?)  The omelette was HUGE.  I was so startled, I asked how many eggs they used (five).  The egg whites were very fluffy and airy, and the omelette really went down smooth.  At least the half I was able to finish.    The potato pancakes were GREAT.  Tasted like little patties of crisp potato hash.  With sour cream and apple sauce, it was very yumm.  Each time I came here, there was a crowd of people at the door, but the wait was never longer than ten minutes.    Solid breakfast place!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb dizzle if you're looking for some solid breakfast choices. I'm personally not a fan of the Dutch baby, but their omelets are massive. You get a good bang for your buck while you're here. Just take note that this place is quite crowded on weekend mornings."}
{"text":"Having been to an Original Pancake House when I lived in Minnesota, I was excited to see a location in Arizona.  I didn't visit this restaurant until my previously favorite breakfast joint stopped serving the Baked Apple Pancake.  I've been here a couple of times for a \"cheat\" meal, specifically for the Baked Apple Pancake. They offer two sizes, a full size and a \"baby\" size. I think most people could split the baby size, but if you are very hungry and want to indulge, a baby size will suit one person just fine. The full size on the other hand is perfect to split if both people want to order something else.  The first time we tried eating here I also ordered a crepe which had some alcohol soaked fruit inside with pecans, served cold, sprinkled with chopped pecans and a side of tropical syrup. If this was refrigerator cold it might have been okay, but it was closer to room temperature, there seemed to be an overwhelming amount of nuts, and it just wasn't that flavorful. I suppose anything compared to their Baked Apple Pancake is sub-par.  The baked pancake though, wow. It is huge and puffy when it arrives, but it does settle a bit. I recommend waiting 2 or 3 minutes before digging in, or else you will burn your mouth and spoil the rest of your meal (don't ask, ha). A good way to do this is to ask for a side of whipped cream (which they will charge you for) as soon as they serve you the apple pancake. By the time the server comes back with the whipped cream, the pancake should be ready for your enjoyment!  Even after settling, the pancake is thick, doughy, filling, and the apples are amazing. If you are lucky, the cooks will have put a little extra brown sugar on top so there will be some crunch, and your experience will be complete. You definitely will feel the need to brush your teeth after eating one of these (not to mention hit the gym), and you probably won't eat for the rest of the day. I don't condone eating these all the time, but once in a while for a special occasion won't make a dent in your daily diet.  A couple things to be aware of; these types of joints make their money on sides, so if ordering sausage, bacon, or another side, the portion size is tiny. If ordering a soda/pop/cola, they serve it by the can (no refills). From the outside the restaurant may not look like much, but it is a great divey breakfast place. It is breakfast place after all, not a 4-star dinner restaurant.  Yay for breakfast.  And most importantly, bring cash; no credit cards are accepted here."}
{"text":"Let's start at the beginning. I arrived on a Saturday morning to join friends for breakfast. I expected to have a parking problem and a long wait however this was not true. Parking was abundant and the wait was under 10 minutes. Out waiter Marc was gracious and knowledgeable. We order a plethora of items to sample: strawberry pancakes, scrambled eggs, corn beef hash, apple waffle, veggies omelette, grits, regular pancakes, Mediterranean omelette and homemade hash browns. Everything was accompanied with: regular syrup, strawberry syrup, apple syrup, sweet butter and fresh whip cream.  I don't like whip cream however this whip cream was great. All of pancakes were light and fluffy and their fruit topping were perfect. The strawberries were freshly sliced and the apples were finely diced and gently cooked in a cinnamon syrup. The corn beef was crispy on the outside with flavorful moist interior. The hash browns took me back to my childhood.   You get picture. Go try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Had the worst experience I've ever had in my life. General manager was super rude when I asked him to substitute pancakes to something  else, he said he have to charge me but He can give me maybe a \"SLICE OF TOMATO\" for free. \"In his own words\"  Like seriously, was that necessary & having a attitude on Saturday afternoon & you happen to be the GENERAL MANAGER? No wonder this place gets bad reviews. It's these people make the restaurant look bad. But food can't save this Original pancake house ANYWAY. I fell the like the GM hated his job & didn't want to be here. For food, Worst taste of pancakes I've ever had. WILL NOT RETURN back to this place ever."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and cooked to perfection. I had a Philly cheesesteak sandwich which was overloaded with. Meat, cheese bell peppers and onions. Couldn't finish it all. Fast friendly service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Thick cripsy bacon.  The best bacon in the world.  mmmmm...bacon.  Supposedly they have great pancakes but who the hell knows.  Its all about the thick cripsy tasty bacon.  Just kidding the pancakes are great and the omlettes are huge.  My favorite were the blueberry with the real blueberries in them not some crappy jam type substance.  They have some other Original House of Pancakes throughout the midwest and I even went to one in Hawaii.  If you go get the bacon.  OHOP closes early on the weekend.  Nothing is worse than being hungover thinking about bacon driving from campus and finding out its closed.  Call ahead."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday around 1 which was the perfect timing because there wasn't a wait. Their menu is pretty big and their pancakes are the best. You can order a meal for two and only spend $25. Their bacon is my favorite because it's always thick although a few pieces were burnt but everything else was good!"}
{"text":"Not a place we generally frequent but the wife had a gift card so we figured we'd give it a shot.  I was as unimpressed as the last time I was there.  I know they have a large following and that's OK, so does Starbucks.  The food is cooked well with a nice presentation and the service is exemplary but for the money we'll drive to Bloomington to the Hyvee for a much better breakfast.  What cost us $25.00 could be gotten for $15 - $17.00 most anywhere else."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place! I love ordering their omelette and pancakes. I like eating them together in one bit for a sweet and salty taste!"}
{"text":"If I could give 100 stars I would....   I went two days in a row.. YEAH it's that good.   The first time I got a spinach omelette with added tomato and bacon, it comes with cheese..... This thing was HUGE it looked like they used a dozen eggs to make it. All omelets come with the to die for pancakes.   My boyfriend got the \"bacon lovers bacon and eggs\" special... His exact words \" they must have a farm outback, because everything taste fresh\".  The second day we went I got sausage patties and eggs, which comes pancakes and my boyfriend got his usual.   The ambiance is a country breakfast feel. The service was AMAZING everyone was sweet as pie. The prices are also very reasonable.  IF YOUR IN VEGAS THIS IS A MUST TRY!!!!"}
{"text":"A couple of folks in our party had expressed a desire to eat German pancakes also known as Dutch babies.  We've eaten at this restaurant before and enjoyed the food.   Our server was Mary; she was sweet and had a really nice calming energy.  She was friendly and attentive. We didn't have to ask for refills, etc...  Everyone enjoyed the food and our server. Always nice to know you can find good food away from the strip.   Definitely a must return."}
{"text":"After a long morning of Black Friday shopping, we ventured to refuel at The Original Pancake House.  My sister and her friends had been raving about the eatery and their breakfast foods for days and so I decided ... why not.  We arrived at around 9am and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.  We were promptly greeted by our server and our drink order was taken.  It's sad to say - but this was the only time in which our server was prompt.  It felt as though after we had ordered, our server didn't seem to check back as frequently as needed.  Upon suggestion of my sister, I ordered the bacon pancakes half order.  I was hoping that the mixture of sweet and salty would satisfy me the way Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles does.  I was wrong again.  The bacon didn't seem to be spread throughout the pancake so I often found myself removing bacon pieces from the middle and saving them for the outer edges.  My husband had a combo of eggs, bacon, and toast - he too didn't find anything too spectacular about the restaurant and even compared it to \"Dennys\" type food (which it was).    A full stack of pancakes would run you about $7 and a half order about $5 (a half order consists of 3 pancakes).  A large orange juice... $3.85!! Jeez! I could buy a whole carton for that!! A cup of coffee... $2.95."}
{"text":"It was pretty good but not worth the wait and the hype. Food tasted like any other breakfast place. Also, parking was a nightmare."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid. Haven't found a place with better pancakes yet. Friendly and attentive service. The cash only policy is annoying because I always forget but it's worth it."}
{"text":"It's so hit or miss.   No one wears name tags so I don't know who this person is but there's a man with a baseball hat and a beard who I've seen doing every job you can imagine in this restaurant. He's the host, the chef, the waiter, the bus boy, and the cashier all at once. If you're ever reading this, we appreciate you!   Food is decent, I've been getting banana pancakes from different OHOP locations in Illinois for years and the ones at this location are no different.   I've lost track of how many early Saturdays we've spent here, so I guess you can call us regulars. If you don't feel like driving to the one on University Avenue, just go here."}
{"text":"The best place in town for breakfast, just no bloody marys."}
{"text":"Seriously this place is the best. We go here for brunch/breakfast all the time! It's definitely one of our \"spots\" in Champaign. Their coffee is always strong and hot, and their sourdough French toast is to die for!! The folks who work here are kind and quick. Always making sure you have the best service. This definitely a Champaign staple."}
{"text":"I came back to this location because I enjoy the food.  The table with the white stuff falling from the ceiling was now blocked off so no one would be put there.  It was a weekend AM and very busy.  We were greeted by the same hostess as last time who is extremely friendly and welcoming.  We were surprisingly seated right away.  The food was good and so was the service.  When I went to check out, I had some gift certificates that were on my email, which was on my phone.  The nice cashier called the manager, Steve, over to take care of me.  He was pretty rude and seemed annoyed by the fact I had the vouchers.  He didn't know anything about them and acted as if they were fabricated.  I didn't say much because I really didn't have the time to argue with him.  He eventually took off the amount I was owed and I went about my day.  I think that next time, I will try another location instead."}
{"text":"This place has many menu options to choose from.  The food is very good and well cooked.  Pancake specials are alway great.  The prices are good.  Service is good, but it can get very busy, so plan ahead!"}
{"text":"This is how breakfast should be done everywhere.  HUGE portions of fantastic and flavorful fare for super cheap with friendly and attentive staff.  The Dutch Baby is their claim to fame, I think, but the other standard dishes (like simple eggs, sausage & hash browns) are also very delicious.  I only wish I had one closer to me in LA."}
{"text":"We got seated quickly.  Server was a nice girl.  Orders were fast and food was tasty.  I bought a groupon for this restaurant, and saved 10 dollars, which felt like a free entree. The orange juice is REAL. I had so much pulp in mine.  I would like to come back to try something else."}
{"text":"Everything I ate here today tasted like it was concocted in back from bags of dried egg, pancake mix, and the scariest of all - hollandaise powder. Fatty texture but not even a little butter or lemon flavor in that mother of all breakfast indulgences. Burnt, dry, microwave tasting omelettes, puffed and brown. Freezer-flavored hash browns with no crisp to them whatsoever.   Basically, the best argument towards anti-corpo food that I've eaten in a long, long while.   It hurt pretty bad, as I used to frequent this chain constantly as a kid - the Kosher made my gma+gpa happy, dad went for the apple pancake, week in, week out. Smoked salmon, potato pancakes, it was all delish. And strawberry pancakes, with fresh whipped cream, were totally my jam.  This new thing sporting the same name is like the OPH I remember but nightmarishly riffing off the nastiest of Denny's. Potato pancakes thin like paper, eerily tasting of potato, floppy and gummy. Sour cream in tiny, spit-cup sized containers. Watered down applesauce.   No thanks."}
{"text":"Very nice services and food. Very noisy this morning due to national holiday. Good in general."}
{"text":"The eggs and pancake mix must be made of gold because the prices are way over priced. I compare to wonderful Dinners from New Jersey and other eateries across the country I have gone to and this place is mehhh...  I recently went there and got the blueberry pancakes and there were almost $10!!! I feel like I am back in New York! and in this case, well, it is NYC. Anyways, that would be fine if the service was great, but except for the bus boys who are always running around and you can grab their attention, the service has also been mehhh  I do not recommend this place. As a matter of fact, I think that as soon as someone else opens up a better place, this place will go down hill...  Also, I should say that if anyone gives this place 5 stars it is because they have not tried Americana Dinner (Hamilton, New Jersey) or Eggsclusive (Genoa, Illinois), now those places are the real deal."}
{"text":"Their sourdough pancakes deserve 5/5 stars! Many places say that their pancakes are sourdough, but they don't taste like sourdough to me. Hey! This is the one."}
{"text":"went here with a groupon in hand and funny drove by many times,,, glad I stopped in, as the food is wonderful,loads of good selection, little pricey for pancakes, but you pay for what you get good tasty food...I tried the Venezia Benedict, big slabs of bacon sandwiched in between with spinach and poached egg and sauce,,mmm just thinking about it makes me hungry for one...Ooh this also come with 4, yes  4 potato pancakes(includes a little sour cream and apple sauce), alittle too much for the heart and cholesteral ,, but I don't eat this stuff everyday... I go early, to beat the morning rush,, before 8am on sunday, was a good time to partake... My friend got the Dutch Garden, another tasty eat, fluffy pancake-baked, topped with vegetables and cheese...... Service has been always prompt the two times I have ventured there.."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast chains but every time I go to this location, the service lags terribly. I say its mainly due to the lack of servers for the amount of patrons they get in. Food is a 5 star but service is a 2.4 My favs are their omelets (every one). It's like a soufflé !! Cant get it like that anywhere else.  Also, their whip cream is probably the best!! I don't think I've had anything on the menu that was less than amazing. I definitely tolerate the slow service for the food. I went there today and ordered their pumpkin pancakes and it came with the amazing whip cream. It's a seasonal special they serve and they do an amazing job! They do it better than at IHOP ~~ :D"}
{"text":"Really great establishment. The go to place for breakfast for my family and I. I love the French toast with bananas."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times. The pancakes are excellent and the service is usually very good. I have requested turkey sausage or bacon for years, and they added it to the menu recently. So now I can visit more often instead of giving all of my money to the competitors."}
{"text":"What kind of backasswards place still clings to a \"Cash Only\" policy? A.) Dive bars that can't be trusted to give you a clean glass, but can be trusted to offer a complimentary sprinkle of crabs on the toilet seat. B.) Wholesome off the radar entertainment, cash up front, that may also give you crabs. Sinner. C.) Cruddy breakfast diners trying to instill an aura of the \"greatest generation.\" Why I remember a time back before that newfangled in-ter-net contraption when I had to walk uphill both ways in waist deep snow to... Those demon harpies are trying to steal your identity! Where's my pants?! D.) All of the above.  Ding! Time's up. Pencils down.   Original Pancake House, did you answer D? No? You just bubbled in a smiley face on your scantron sheet? Well why not change your answer now, just a little substitute. Oh you charge a minimum of a dollar for any substitute or deviation from your menu. That's straight up retarded. I'm relegating you to the short bus for the remainder of term.  I see that you also have a tiny clause that states you're at liberty to add an 18% gratuity to any order. How very sneaky of you to not define the terms of that. So you're a trouble maker too? I'll be keeping my eye on you.  A strict \"No Cellphones\" policy? Interesting idea, but the place is so obnoxiously loud that I don't see the cause for such a stipulation, and since we only saw our waitress in passing, I can't fathom that it's out of respect for her. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think you've fully developed that theme. Rework that passage and turn it back in by Monday for full credit.  That brings me to my next point, OPH. It's a great idea to have a wide variety of friends, from brodogs and scottstiudes to old folks and families out for brunch. It's really nice to see you making an effort to make everyone feel included, but your waitstaff, they're crappy, hon. Terse, perfunctory, and cold, like little automatons they whir around the restaurant. Order. Better hope you don't need anything else. Human feelings are not programmed into their model. Eat. Now get out. There are people waiting for your seat. Repeat.  And what gives you the gall to think you can charge $4.25 for three pieces of dinky bacon? OPH, I'm really disappointed in you. Since you don't allow any substitutions and since none of your entrees come with any sides (aside from massive amounts of carb-y, bland pancakes), you're practically forcing people to order certain menu items a la carte. Your food is overpriced as it is. Breakfast for two cost us 35 bucks, and we didn't even get that much food. For shame. I'm assigning you Saturday detention for the remainder of the month. Maybe that'll teach you some respect.  Now let's move on to your coursework. The food that you delivered was actually quite good. I had the Eggs Michael (even though I would have liked to substitute Canadian bacon, I couldn't justify the ridiculous extra charge on an already pricey entree) with four thin potato pancakes. The yolks of the poached eggs created a lovely little dipping sauce, the sausage beneath it jujitsu'd my taste buds to smithereens with its awesomosity, and the English muffin base was crispity and delicious. The accompanying mushroom sauce...what is the term you kids use today...sucked big dangly donkey balls. A flavorless white sauce with canned mushroom floating around looking bored with their lot in life. I can't justify cream sauce unless it's good, and your gravy sucked those donkey balls blue, OPH. The potato pancakes more than made up for the crappy sauce though. Thin little hashbrown patties with sour cream and applesauce! Yum!  Mr. Man ordered the spinach crepes with a side order of homefries and redonkulously overpriced bacon. The homefries were the only stand out aspect of that meal. The spinach filling was soggy, had more tasteless canned mushrooms filler (even came complete with the bland mushroom dipping crap) and I could taste none of the cheese you claimed was there. Quite disappointing, OPH. You did your homework at the last minute on that one, didn't you?  It's clear that you have potential. However since your grade is cumulative, I'm going to have to give you a C. Tut, tut, tut, no complaining. You earned it."}
{"text":"On a quest for a waffle with strawberries, I found myself at the Original Pancake House on a Saturday morning. It was crowded, but we were seated within 15 minutes of arrival. I ordered the waffle with strawberry. My friend had pecan pancakes and an omelet. She liked everything. I was excited to see fresh strawberries. I've learned not to take such things for granted. The whipped cream wasn't fluffy enough for me. I think it was home made. I like it out of the can better, as it was also too sweet. Almost taste like iced cream. Nevertheless, the waffle was great and I was about to eat about 3/4 of it before getting full. I also had bacon. It had a good taste, but was too thick for my liking. Overall, this is a good place with good service. It's very busy, but they do a good job moving things along."}
{"text":"The omelets are amazing! I can feed 4 people. The pancakes are the best. Love the service and the food"}
{"text":"4.5 stars   I have been enjoying the food here for over 10 years, back when they were in Hilldale. The new location doesn't have the same eating-in-your-grandparent's-kitchen feel, but the food is just as delicious. The servings are generous, especially for the price point. The only downfall is the amount of time you can wait at peak meal times. I don't recommend going at 11am on a Saturday. You'll probably be waiting 20 - 30 minutes for a table, and there isn't much seating available while you wait.   My favorites are the blueberry crepes with homemade whipped cream and the chocolate chip pancakes. The homemade whipped cream is fantastic. The omelets are also good. The coffee is strong but smooth and they're very good about coming around and refilling your mug."}
{"text":"Our first visit here, the food was exceptional. You have to try the potato pancakes. Our waiter Jessie did an outstanding job during a very busy hour. Also purchased coffee cups and can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu. Do yourself a favor come try them out. Portions are Hardy"}
{"text":"I have to say, I'm am dumbfounded by the other reviews. I have been coming here for nearly a decade and never once had a bad experience.  Nearly everything is homemade.  The pancakes are not the typical prefab mix garbage, but a mix of natural ingredients.  The strawberry waffles are not covered in strawberry sauce, but fresh cut strawberries.  They make their own corned beef hash from scratch, which is one of my favorites. And to top all of this off, most of their juices are fresh squeezed.  There aren't many breakfast beverages better than a freshly squeezed glass of OJ.  The only real downside for me is that you need cash.  Even if you show up when they're busy, which is often, it really is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for breakfast and stopped in. I was not disappointed. I was seated immediately and was able to promptly place my order. Everything came out hot and tasty."}
{"text":"I had always driven past, and wondered if this was the same place as the chains in IL, and yes, it is.  These are the pancakes you remember, but not the restaurant.  We showed with a group of 15, and granted, that's overwhelming, but they had no idea what to do.  After 5 minutes, rather than putting us in the long bench seat in the front, they put us in 3 different tables and booths across the back of the restaurant.  The place wasn't full, but we were greeted, and got our coffee.    They have tons of waffle, crape, and pancake options, omelet, and meat sides to add on.  I ordered the Georgia pancakes and a side of thick-cut bacon, and ended up eating on those pancakes for 3 days (order the stack of 3).   The flavor was good, nothing special, but the service is where they could use the help.  The waitress had an attitude problem.  She was too young, and it was too early for her to be so rude.  I was all, \"yes, can't wait to bring people here\".  And left thinking, \"wow, I won't be going back there\".    Good, cheap food at terrible service prices."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite places in Charlotte. If you're looking for quick easy breakfast faves, this is the place to come. Of course the pancakes are great, as are the Belgian waffles. Staff is always welcoming and friendly. This location uses the no wait app so you Can get on line before you even get there! I've never had lunch or dinner here but I'm sure it's just as delicious as breakfast."}
{"text":"I enjoy the pancakes but the bacon and eggs so-so. Price not as good as competition, but also not unreasonable overall."}
{"text":"An ok place to have breakfast.  I was not entirely impressed with the pancakes and breakfast items.  I would say very close to Ihop and such.  If I were to choose a breakfast place in Vegas if this is a drive for you, I would skip it and go to a closer breakfast place.  Nothing really would make me want to revisit the place."}
{"text":"Now that I hop is gone, the original House of Pancakes is probably one of the premier breakfast spots in Champaign. For you quick eaters, it's a pretty busy place . Like most breakfast places places in the Midwest, you'll find that they close early and open even earlier. If you're ready to eat at a reasonable breakfast time let's say 10 or 11, you're going to be in for a wait. It's usually 15 to 20 minutes no matter what day you go. But, the wait is worthwhile. The food is pretty inexpensive . you usually spend between 10 and 15 dollars including drinks. But that can include eggs bacon and some of their awesome pancakes a variable flavors. I tried about half of them and so far I have not found a bad bunch. They also have thick sliced bacon which I am always a fan of. To accompany your meal, try some of the fresh squeezed orange juice. Of course the local favorites are the Apple pancakes and the Dutch baby. These can take up to a half hour to make because they are made in an oven but they're pretty good. I still prefer a good old fashioned eggs, bacon, and pancake breakfast. Service is always wonderful and the staff is always happy to see you. They accept most forms of payment including credit card and cash."}
{"text":"Tucked in south Scottsdale right near the Fashion Square mall is a throw back to the 1950's. I love the bright counter tops and the bright colored leather booths. It's a good morning kind of place!  It's stuck in time and they make it work. When I first starting going here they didn't take credit cards or debit cards, cash only.  I thought that was a little strange but they have since changed that policy.   The dutch baby... OMG.  I love this delicious buttery, sweet pancake bowl that takes some time but worth the wait, it's superb!!  A couple dabs of butter, powder sugar, lemon and maple syrup and you will have breakfast dessert party in your mouth!!  I also love it with orange  Suzette sauce!  Which brings me to their crepes... french crepes!!  Have to try them... they are hard to pass up!  Dessert for breakfast.    The savory side of me has had their Eggs Michael which reminded me of biscuits and gravy but a much more sophisticated version.  Mushrooms in a sherry sauce over eggs served on an english muffin. Need I say more.  The also serve up some mean potato pancakes... it's a heavy breakfast, so good.  Servers are usually fast and so is the food.  The dutch baby is the only dish that takes additional time.  Deciding on what to order,  savory vs. sweet is always my biggest issue.  Both are great here!!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast in the local area. Now, it is pricey compared with other places, so I can't disagree with that criticism. But, look at what you get - the omelettes are enormous and come with pancakes.  Plus, I don't even like pancakes, yet I find myself getting them more often than not. Not into pancakes? Their whole wheat toast is awesome.  Service is great, and even the wait goes by rather quickly (unless you're in a huge group - I never understand why people who go in huge groups criticize breakfast places for not seating them right away). And they have excellent coffee. Don't fear the line."}
{"text":"A nice place with good service and surroundings.  Excellent light with suitable sites."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new Brunch place and came across this one. So glad we went, food was really good, Philly cheesesteak omelet was phenomenal, coffee was really good. Since it was our first time Charlette the waitress helped us with what to get and she is a Superstar. I will be requesting to sit at her section again."}
{"text":"If ya like pancakes this place sure has em'  Discrete location just west of Fashion Square mall on Camelback (left of the motel 6 - a bonus, as you might need a nap after too many pancakes). The walls have autographs of 100's of celebrities and sports legends who have previously dined here.  It took awhile to get our order, but when it arrived I was delighted. We tried the strawberry pancakes and the buckwheat pancakes, and that is some darned good eatin'  I would pick this over Denny's ANY DAY."}
{"text":"Man what a disservice this particular location is doing to franchise that was sorta a Vegas staple since as long as I can remember. So, lets begin with how excited my husband and I were when we saw the groupon offer for this place, 50% off for some yummy breakfast......count us in! We arrive and are immediately seated, no wait at all. They were busy but not crazy like I remember the charleston location being. We were welcomed by our waiter taking our drink orders minutes after being seated....hey we're off to a great start. He comes back a few minutes later and we proceed to order. I order bacon, eggs with the side of pancakes. I ask if they can provide a side of salsa, he says sure for an extra dollar. Ummmm, come again? Now it's not that it's a lot of money, but were talking a small side of salsa here, needless to say I passed. My husband ordered (or at least attempted) the bacon waffles with strawberries. Our waiter, \"my apologies but we don't have any strawberries, they are still out of season and we have yet to receive our shipment.\" Hmmmmm, that's pretty interesting cause I can pretty much guarantee I can drive over to albertsons across the street and they will have a plethora of fresh, ripe strawberries. In fact, I bought a bulk of them at Costco just a week or so ago for valentines day. Whatever. So my husband opts for the bacon waffles with blueberries. Now I don't know about y'all but I like fast, efficient service but this was almost frightening. We literally put in our order, and about 2 minutes later here comes our waiter with our breakfast. I said, \" wow! That was like the cooks could here us ordering and got on it before you even got back there to give them the ticket.\" Well here's why...... Husbands waffles were NOT cooked all the way through. In fact you could taste the runny batter in your mouth as you took a bite. It was so disgusting. He was so turned off he took two bites and put it to the side. I felt so bad, I offered him my pancakes and some bacon. He took my pancakes and took a bite.....wow.....how do you screw up.......pancakes??? Your restaurant is supposed to be known for that very dish! I tore off a piece of pancake, I just wanted to see what he was talking about. Holy shit.....the pancakes tasted like the card board box I assume they came out of. We did not put any butter or syrup on the pancakes, in my humble opinion you should be able to eat a pancake without having to add all that sugar, to me the syrup and butter is just an added little pleasure. The pancake should still taste delicious without the sugar. My oh my....what a waste. I would have been a ton happier at Montana mining company, breakfast for 4.95. Bacon, eggs, potatoes and side of pancakes.....and it's yummy. Oh and they don't charge for salsa. I'll never go back to this place, ever."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and excellent service. Your coffee cup will never be empty.  The apple pancake is something everyone should try at least once."}
{"text":"Sorry Amy P. this place is bum city. It used to be a family favorite. Now, the lines are forever, food portions are lacking and coffee refills are denied. Won't waste my time again."}
{"text":"We used the Yelp App to decide where to go for breakfast while visiting Charlotte, NC, for our first time.  This place had a 4 star rating.  The reviews and food photos looked pretty darn good so we gave it a try.  It was fantastic!  We ordered the French press coffee and both the apple pancake and the Dutch baby with fruit (both considered their specialty items).  My husband truly enjoyed his apple pancake, but it had a bit too much cinnamon for my taste.  The Dutch baby is unlike anything I've ever had before.  Each bite was so darn good but I had trouble finishing it - it was huge!  We would definitely go back if we're ever back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a breakfast joint with a hometown feel, this might be your place.  The place has a very 70s era theme about it, aqua green and roller shades!  Everything seemed very clean and my hostess was very attentive.  The food was good too, although the prices are a bit higher than I think they should be, but it is right next to the fashion mall....   Their western omelet was very good, they bake it so the egg rises.  It was very fluffy with just the right amount of ham and cheese, and was not greasy at all.  Plus you get pancakes with it, although I opted for an english muffin.  I would put the food here on par with US Egg, but with a better atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Original Pancake House and never disappoints. Service is very prompt and friendly the food comes out steaming hot so hot that it takes a minute for you to wait for it to cool down. I absolutely love their buttermilk pancakes and this time I didn't disappoint. The pancakes were very fluffy and hot it was so hot that as soon as I put the butter on it had melted and slid right off of the pancakes. I suggest during your visit you ask for the warm syrup that makes the pancakes go to a completely different level of fluffiness in your mouth. I also suggest that you get their hash browns and wait and take them home because eating them the day after makes it that much better."}
{"text":"This place is always a favorite. The hostesses are always welcoming and friendly. They keep things moving and are very organized in handling seating people and checking you out. The food is great and consistently good every single time.  The waitresses are friendly and very attentive.  The staff who refills beverages are on top of things never leaving you to ask for a refill. This place has been around for a long time and I can see why. Excellent food, atmosphere and staff."}
{"text":"I came by this location after my mom had helped me move into my new apartment in Charlotte. We were extremely disappointed. We came around 1:00pm so the restaurant was quite empty yet they sat us in the very back near the drink station. Next the food came out and the pancakes had egg shells in them. I will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"A Charlotte classic! Probably the best spot in Charlotte for breakfast. Everything is delicious and the portions are large and filling! If you took an IHOP and Waffle House and put them together then added fresh food and a home town feel, you would have OPH! In fact, it's hard to visit a IHOP or Waffle House after eating at OPH. Give it a Try!"}
{"text":"Items Selected: Chocolate Chip Buttermilk Short Stack Challah French Toast Baked Apple Pancake  Technically a chain, with origins in Portland OR and the famous Walker Bros location in Wilmette IL, it was only when Groupon offered a discount that I realized Las Vegas even had an Original Pancake House and although I guess it could be said that the $8 discount was the impetus for my visit, in reality it was fond childhood memories that drew me through the doors.  Located on Fort Apache, and thus less than ten minutes from my door, it was after another long morning run that I arrived at the sizeable storefront and although the clock had just ticked past 7:15am I entered the restaurant to find the place already lively, a quartet of tables already seated while two couples before me checked in with a friendly hostess soon leading them to their seats.  Eventually finding my place at a booth best suited for four it was mere seconds before my server stopped by and with my order pre-decided based on past experience a simple request that plates arrive in two courses was granted, the long cooking time of the later assuring a fifteen minute delay between rounds.  Sipping on water as the restaurant continued to fill it would not be long before first plates arrived and although the restaurant's eponymous buttermilk batter was fluffy as ever beneath a mountain of whipped cream it was the house-baked challah that truly impressed, the exterior rendered crispy while the center was soaked in sweet custard playing counterpoint the rich egginess of soft bread.  Admittedly a substantial start, and nearly enough to use up my gift certificate, there was simply no way I was leaving Original Pancake House without ordering one of their signatures and this time opting for the Baked Apple Pancake over the Dutch Baby I'll simply say that one cannot go wrong with either, the piping hot pile of thinly sliced Granny Smith's teaming with cinnamon and sugar atop a buttery golden base proving as much a 'pie' as it does a pancake, but absolutely delicious regardless of what it is called.  Individually owned and operated but similar in menu from coast-to-coast there is simply 'something' about Original Pancake House that makes me smile - the service ever pleasant, the space always bustling, and the apple pancake always served so hot that you *know* the first bite is likely to end in a blistered mouth.  Obviously a bit more expensive than IHOP or Denny's but also using superior ingredients including 93-score butter, pure whipping cream, and free-range eggs it's good to know that every once in a while you can indeed find a taste of 'home,' even a thousand or more miles away."}
{"text":"Overall - this place is okay. We come here when we are craving something sweet. We share the apple pancake (which is such a huge portion that we typically take a lot of it home with us). My fiancé got two eggs and bacon, as well. He said it was good but we were charged $8 for the eggs and bacon, which is pretty steep. I ordered some potato pancakes which were good on flavor but super dry - they fell apart into crumbles when we tried to eat them. We didn't even ask for a box to take what was left of them with us.   We come to this spot maybe twice a year and I don't see us increasing that. It's okay but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. There are several superior brunch spots in the CLT area that I am more likely to go to.  Note: I appreciated that Karen T. (I am guessing she is the manager of this location) read my review and responded but found her to be somewhat rude in her response. It doesn't matter that this establishment hasn't raised their prices in a few years - that does not change my opinion that some items are overpriced. Also, there was no offer of toast or pancakes with my fiancé's eggs and bacon. One of my pet peeves is when businesses don't welcome the feedback of customers and her defensive response makes me feel even more confident about my two star rating."}
{"text":"We visited the OPH on a Sunday morning. There were so many people waiting that we thought it would take a while, however the wait was relatively short about 10 minutes. We started with the fresh squeezed orange juice! It was very fresh and and a large is in a huge glass! A small is all you may need. My companion ordered the Bacon and Egg platter that comes with 3 pancakes. He said that it was all cooked well and the bacon was thick cut and cooked to just the right crispness. I ordered the Chorizo omelet with banana pancakes. The omelet was HUGE! Apparently they make their omelets with 5 eggs! You definitely could share! I took over half of it with me. The omelet was very fresh, just the right amount of spicy, and came with a warm salsa and sour cream. I barely made a dent in it! Then I had 4 smaller banana pancakes with a dusting of powdered sugar. I only need a very small amount of syrup, as the pancakes were sweet from the bananas. I like a little more banana in my pancakes, but overall they were still great. We really enjoyed our meal and would definitely go back...but share next time!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! The German pancakes are amazing. Their freshly squeezed orange juice is actually freshly squeezed. Every time I come, I have great service and delicious food.   I highly recommend this restaurant to ANYONE!!! The food is fresh and has that home cooked taste."}
{"text":"I can't explain how they can make food that is so tasteless. I went with my dad for brunch. I ordered a vegetable omelet with cheese--so bland--it didn't matter how much salt and pepper on it, just no flavor and way way too much cheese! My dad had an omelet as well and he even put ketchup on it just to try and get some flavor and he never does that.  I will never go there again nor can i recommend anyone else go there."}
{"text":"Lots of food for a fair price! We both had their oven baked omelettes- which are AMAZING (see picture). Both made with 4 eggs and come with 3 pancakes. Lots of filling food. Mushroom omelette was a little bland, the spinach omelette had GREAT flavor.   Had a cup of coffee (unlimited refills)- coffee was great for a non-coffee shop establishment, however a little pricy. Great coffee though.  Plain buttermilk pancakes were basic pancakes. Their menu had a wide assortment of pancake flavors that looked delicious.   NOTE: They only accept CASH! No credit or debit card accepted. They have an ATM, obviously. Luckily we had the $$.   I recommend this place for a simple breakfast. Be alert omelette lovers!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome- best pancakes in charlotte! You absolutely have to try either the apple pancake or Dutch baby. They both take longer to make but are so incredibly worth it. The wait is always pretty long on weekends but you can get in like ahead of time using the No Wait app. Otherwise expect around an hour wait!"}
{"text":"While I won't deny that the food is good and plenty big portion wise, 3 stars because they should be ashamed of themselves to charge $4.89 for a glass of OJ."}
{"text":"All I have to say is yummy in my tummy!  I ordered the western omelet and so glad I did. Not only did I have plenty for breakfast but there was tons to take home.  Huge fan and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The pancakes are really good never overdone or underdone. Good service waitresses are nice and it does not take that long to get your food."}
{"text":"Busy place in the weekend mornings. Good food for the price!"}
{"text":"Relatively clean environment. Professional and friendly service. Fairly priced. Recommended to anyone who enjoys pancakes (obviously), but does offer non-pancake options too.   Pancakes are well made, and I especially enjoy the hash browns (chunky potatoes)."}
{"text":"pretty good breakfast spot but $6 for a small glass of orange juice is a bit much. the Denver omelette was solid."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place.   Seriously, their food is amazing.   For starters, I love that they have the traditional thin waffle.   My personal favorite is the waffle with strawberries.   And it comes with a strawberry syrup.    Their bacon is the best in town.  Thick cured and flavorful bacon.  Yum!  The staff is always friendly and the wait time is never as bad as other restaurants."}
{"text":"They are in my top 5 spots for a great breakfast. Sometimes the wait can be a little ridiculous but the pancakes make it more than worth it. 49er flap jacks all the way!"}
{"text":"Great service! You more than enough food for your money and the service is flawless. The only reason it didn't 5/5 is because you have to catch the establishement on it's rare occasion of not being PACKED or else you'll be waiting a bit for a table as it's almost always busting at the seams (on weekends)."}
{"text":"Near the top of my list of great breakfast joints. The pancake choices are extensive (including potato pancakes). Great menu and service. I try something different every time I eat here, and haven't been disappointed yet. Only downfall is that I don't think this place is a secret as it's usually busy.  Side note: Check out the weird orange juice machine."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to try out this place because it was close to home. The service is absolutely terrible!! Our server Stephanie specifically contributed to why our time here was unpleasant. The hash potatoes were extremely burnt and taste awful, the syrup was cold, and on top of that the sever caught an attitude because I asked her to please remake them. The only positive was the strawberry waffles which taste AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the ham and cheese omelet. The servings are enormous. I barely finished half of it and was only able to eat one of my side of pancakes. Lots of people there so you know the food is good. The German pancakes with lemon and powdered sugar are also delicious."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast/ lunch today. Debi was my waitress.  She was fabulous, fast friendly and very efficient.  The food is great I had a western omelet and my husband had a philly steak sandwich. Both where perfect. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"It's hard to make breakfast exceptional in my opinion. But very easy to ruin it. The food here is always very, very good! They have a HUGE menu so everyone should be able to find something they like. The 30-45 minute wait on the weekends is worth the wait."}
{"text":"oph is so good!  anything on the menu is worth trying and the service is always exceptional."}
{"text":"These chocolate chip pancakes were so good. I was definitely impressed. I wish I was more hungry so I could eat more. I would go back again!"}
{"text":"Dont go out of your way for this breakfast place. It was ok food and ok service. Good part - very clean and friendly."}
{"text":"This place used to be good... About a year or more ago. It seems to me they have changed ownership or management or something. The food quality is bad now. They have a menu item that has a bunch of bacon. The bacon used to be crispy and thick not it couldn't be more thin and under cooked. They give you a huge plate with two items on it and it makes it look like they forgot part of your meal. I've tried everything here. Nothing is good.   I had the sausage and hash browns. The hash was undercooked (despite asking for it to be crispy). The sausage was cold. Seems they put it onto the griddle frozen and it didn't cook all the way or something. The pancakes alone are okay. The thing about pancakes, waffles and French toast are they are only as good as their syrup. Well the syrup is the cheapest tasting syrup substitute I've ever had. You can taste the sugar/ corn syrup in it. It has no smoky or mapley flavor to it (not even fake flavor).   Service is fine. Nothing to get excited about. Maybe 3/5 stars. The food is just so horrible that it brought the rating down that much.  My family and I have decided we will not return unless there are no other options. My warning is just because you had it before doesn't mean it is close to the same. I mean there wasn't even a piece of orange or parsley or melon on my plate like there usually is when you order breakfast at any other breakfast place"}
{"text":"Tried again.  The owner or manager left a note on my review to come back for a second chance, so we did.   The service was much friendlier this time so that was a huge improvement.  However the coffee still tastes super weak - like half the strength of coffee anywhere else.  When you ask for stronger coffee, they're quick to offer the expensive shot of espresso- clearly a scam that is still paying off for them.    Food was good.  It is too bad.  Raise the prices a nickel and start putting enough coffee grounds in the filter.  Please."}
{"text":"I was sadden when they took away the pancake house at GVR.  So Brad T. & I was craving the pancake house one morning & we decided to drive all the way to the west side to satisfy our cravings.  (ohhh yess.)  Service (5):  The service was outstanding.  They were very friendly & they always seem cheerful.   Food (5): We ordered the Dutch Baby pancakes and waffles.  Aamazzing.  The dutch baby pancake with the squeeze of lemons makes it unbelievably gooooddd.  I could eat probably 3 of them all for myself.  The waffles were good and the waffle was soft and it had a heavenly smell.   Atmosphere (4):  Very down to earth breakfast place.   Overall (5):  Highly recommended and one of the best places to go for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"I love their hot chocolate! I don't really like pancakes, but I usually go with my sister who adores them. Pretty good service except there's this really creepy dishwasher who is always staring.... Really creepy."}
{"text":"Breakfast doesn't get much better than Original Pancake house.  The place gets packed on the weekends so be prepared to wait. I've been a couple times and had to wait an hour each time. The wait I will say is well worth it.  The service is friendly. You can sit at the counter area or at a table. Coffee is always refilled right away. The waitresses are friendly that I've interacted with. My order was taken quickly.  I order the bacon pancakes which are amazing! They're the perfect consistency and not too thick or thin. I feel like they're not weighing my stomach down like some places do. Maybe it's a better batter..I don't know.  The eggs are fresh. The bacon is thick and cooked to perfection. The hashrooms are average, just standard hashbrowns and maybe could have been cooked a little more on the inside.  It's a great breakfast and always first on my list for a Saturday or Sunday morning if I feel like going out. I've been to the one in Milwaukee and this one is a little different. It seems like they have more options and it's definitely cheaper."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place I've gone to. I've only gone twice but I really want to go again. The crepes,pancakes and even omelets were the best I've had. Not much else to say except try their specialties. I tried their Apple pancakes which was a bit heavy for those not expecting it but almost reminded me of a pie with the fresh apples flavor."}
{"text":"I have lived in Madison for nearly 5 years and for some reason I always wrote Original  Pancake House off as a sub-par or generic chain of breakfast places like Denny's, but man...this place does it right.   I ordered the 49er Flapjacks because so many other people have raved about them on here, and holy crap...how is it possible for pancakes that big to be so delicious!? Absolutely the best pancakes I have ever had.   Other highlights were the perfectly crispy hashbrowns, the thick cut and perfectly cooked bacon, and constantly refilled cup of tasty and locally roasted coffee.   The only negative was that it was incredibly busy and had a 45 minute wait before we sat down. The great service and the fact that our food came out in less than 10 minutes after ordering made up for that, though.   I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I have heard lots of rants and raves about the great pancakes at OHOP, which is located in the parking lot of the Motel 6 right by Neiman Marcus (I know...it is an odd block of Camelback Road). Parking is adequate...there were people waiting outside, yet my dining companion and I were able to get parking in the lot, and there is street parking if needed.  We were told that we would have a 20-25 minute wait and were given a ticket with a number. Our number was called about 10 minutes later and we were seated. We were accosted by what seemed like dozens of signs warning us that they don't accept credit cards for payment as we walked to our seats, so I made a mental note to go to the ATM located in the restaurant after placing our orders ($2.50 fee, and more ranting on this later).  The decor is indeed classic outdated breakfast chic. It looks like Mel's diner, but with tables much closer together. We ordered coffee and orange juice and sat down to look over the menu. They have a large variety of pancakes that vary in both batter type (buckwheat, potato, buttermilk, chocolate chip) and topping (banana, coconut, lignonberries). In addition they have a large selection of crepes and omlettes (the oms come with a short stack of buttermilk pancakes).  We received our coffee, which was of the standard generic diner variety, and placed our order. I ordered a short stack of the 49er flap jacks, described as plate-size, chewy, and tender, and added a a side order of potatoes. My friend ordered the \"lacy\" swedish pancakes, which come with lignonberries. He also ordered an english muffin on the side.  Our food arrived and the pancakes were great. My 49ers were chewy, almost creamy, and delicious. The texture and consistency was perfect, and they absorbed the butter and syrup perfectly. They were almost crepe-thin, but were not delicate. My companion spoke very highly of the swedish cakes as well. The potatoes were a nightmare though. In most breakfast situations, one expects a side order of potatoes to be cooked to order, served fresh off the griddle. That was not the case with these potatoes. They had the temperature and texture that indicates they had spent the better part of the morning drying out in a steam table. They were seasoned perfectly, with just the right amount of onion and pepper tossed in, and I am sure they were delicious when they were cooked, but by the time they reached my table, they tasted like yesterday's leftovers reheated in a microwave.  The check arrived and the damage was $32. Keep in mind that this is not the place to go for a \"bargain\" breakfast. Our bill included the two pancake orders (mine was a short stack), a side of potatoes, an english muffin, 2 coffees, one juice, and an extra side of berries ($1.50). The pancakes are definitely worth the $7-9.25 that they charge, but there is no reason to go for the side dishes. In all honesty, I prefer the food and atmosphere at a place like Palette if I want a $32 breakfast. The pancakes here are something that I expect I will have a craving for again, though.  Service was friendly and prompt. Our drinks never went below half-full and the wait staff was friendly and helpful.  On to the Credit Card issue. I totally understand that businesses don't want to deal with the fees and hassle associated with accepting credit cards, but for a restaurant in a major tourist area where a meal for 2 costs more than $30, it seems silly and stubborn to refuse to accept credit cards. I can almost picture some crotchety, grumpy guy in the back boring his grandchildren with yet another diatribe about how the credit card companies are out to get him. My point is, If you are going to charge an upscale price, you need to accept credit card payment. period.  So overall, 3 stars. It would have been 4 stars had it not been for the steam-table potatoes and the annoyance of paying 2.50 to pay."}
{"text":"Food was good. Always enjoy the 49er flap jacks.  Service was slow and bacon was hard as a rock. Almost chipped a tooth."}
{"text":"I have been going here since college (lol too long ago), and it is both nostalgic and homey. It never changes, the food is always and always has been amazing. There are a lot of 'good' breakfast places in Charlotte, but this is tried and true. Everything I've ever gotten is delicious and no-fuss.   Really any of the Original Pancake locations in Charlotte are great. Make sure you are ready for a wait though--they are always packed!"}
{"text":"Every time I find an Original Pancake House I have to go. We don't have them on Long Island where I'm from and it became more of a tradition when we go to Florida. I was so happy to find one in Arizona. My favorite thing is the Dutch Baby and it was amazing as always! On the way to the restaurant my father was so excited that he would get his fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and cheese blintzes, only to find out that they didn't have either. This is his breakfast of choice when we visit the Florida locations. I've never actually seen my father as crushed in spirit as he was. They also didn't have club soda or sparkling water which I thought was also super weird. He wound up with an omelette which he enjoyed. We learned from our waitress Jessica that each franchise has a different menu and that the blintzes have been requested by other customers as well. She even said she would speak to the owner to see if it could be added due to the amount of requests! Jessica was a great waitress and even sympathized with my father. Hopefully when we come to visit next time they will update the options!"}
{"text":"I had the corn beef omelet with Gouda cheese.  The omelet was very light and fluffy, the meat all seemed to be concentrated in the middle with only egg on the surrounding edges.  It came with three buttermilk pancakes which were very good.  Service was good, and the place appeared clean.  It was early morning, and the place wasn't too busy, so I guess we lucked out."}
{"text":"Positive- Pancakes were awesome! I get the choco, but they are all good. Very glad I experienced this restaurant. Excellent omelets and fresh squeezed orange juice is always a plus!  Negative- Service was extreemly slow, I believe we waited 15-20 minutes for our food to come out. Servers not very personable and somewhat pricey for the amount.  All in all, definitely worth checking out 1X. However, if you are in a hurry or have somewhere to be, this is not the place."}
{"text":"Perfect Dutch Baby.  Thank you Mary, our waitress came the coffee coming.  Great breakfast.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Service was amazing. The servers are very very nice and helpful. I'm a big fan of savory breakfast so I got the Corned Beef Hash. The potatoes are kinda dry... The corned beef was just ok. It came with pancakes or toasts so it was a lot of food for the price :)"}
{"text":"Waiting to be seated and the greeter helps someone else cause my wife was on her phone playing a game (not talking) so she helps the next person. Which they said she was  rude. So she helps us. But i will report her to the mgr.   Just for the rudeness they get a 1 star forever. ..if my food is wrong they will never get and I will remove my star.   Oh one more thing this place hates cell phones. I will place a picture of it . What did I just walk in ?? This is a time warp dimensional!! Where cells phones are hated!!! Good lord"}
{"text":"Only been here once but, that one time brought me the best scrambled eggs I've ever had in Charlotte, maybe anywhere.  Moist and fluffy and exactly what I have in my minds eye when I order scrambled eggs but almost never get.  Pancakes and sausage were boss too.  5 Stars until I show up again and they happen to offer less than the aforementioned perfection!  As always with my reviews of fine South of Uptown locations, my only complaint is that it's too far from home.  Any of you getting the idea that I need to pack up the family and move?"}
{"text":"We came here a few weeks ago and the service was so slow.  when we asked the waitress why it was taking so long after about 40 minutes of waiting after we ordered our food, she rudely replied that the oven takes a while to cook an omelette. The person I was with only ordered a salad she got back a big bowl with only a third of it filled with salad and they charged her six dollars for it. when I got my omelette, the cheese wasn't melted. The portion was extremely large and I couldn't even finish it and I had to take it home and it served as another meal. That would have been fine but the omelette was not very good. the prices are way too high for the quality of food they serve. I will not be going back here."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?!? I literally love this little joint. It's cozy warm and friendly and the food is delicious. My boss and I usually go here on Thursday midday to give the week a jolt of energy or sugar..... the pancake batter is seriously sweet tasty and delicious and they pack a punch into their omelette!!!! My absolute favorite is their southwestern..... the flavors are loud and impactful .... not to mention it's gigantic! Definitely try the blue berry pancakes and corn beef hash!!  Most days I leave this place excited and ready to pass out ...."}
{"text":"My favorite signs at TOPH: *Please turn cell phones off while dining at TOPH! (annoyed by and enjoyed by this sign) * No oatmeal during summer! (WTF! LOL!) * This room dedicated to my friend Stanley (the back room had a plaque...Stanley who? Kubrik? Roper? Steemer?...the mystery remains...) Retro diner meets whimsical, artsy cafe. The front room has a counter complete with beehived, geriatric waitresses. Back room, a little more modern with trippy artwork (floating pancakes on a checkered sidewalk...kinda Willie Wonka meets flour...glad I wasn't in my mushroom phase) We had the most delightful server, very accommodating, friendly and yes...beehived and geriatric. We ordered typical fare like eggs, bacon and such and yes, PANCAKES. The buttermilk pancakes did not disappoint though I do enjoy a slightly crispy edge on my flapjacks. Banana cakes were just sweet enough. Yummy! Prices, however, not so retro but not over the top. Loved our staycation, loved my cakes, loved the architecture but not loving the $2.50 ATM charge because they don't accept credit or debit cards. Sneaky pancake people!"}
{"text":"I have been here for two times now. I have tried pancakes,  they were wonderful (try the strawberry and banana ones). Not a big fan of crepes here but waffles are also really good. I also like their maple syrup."}
{"text":"Share the Canadian bacon n eggs with the side of buttermilk pancakes upgraded to blueberry.  Solid coffee.  Great place to stop in after a long night of partying or for a quick bite on the way to McCarren."}
{"text":"This was the weirdest dining experience any of us had ever had. Our waiter was overly friendly (to the point of creepiness,) the food was okay but way over priced and the atmosphere was fucking weird.  I'd go here again if I had to but if I have a choice I'll try something else."}
{"text":"I can see why some people might not care to eat at a Motel 6. I also understand that the lack of a kids menu can be a problem for some families. But this is the Original Pancake House! I don't mind modest surroundings for breakfast and the kids won't mind sharing.   This location has been here for awhile, years, and the restaurant has a 1980's ma and pa feel as a result. Perfect for pancakes in my opinion. There's a wall next to the restrooms that has autographs of some minor and some even more minor celebrities. A window looks out onto the Motel 6 pool.   There can be a wait at peak times, and some of the menu items are baked, requiring a more time as well. Budget a little extra time just in case. Pancakes are fluffy. Portions are large. A variety of egg dishes will well satisfy breakfast protein lovers and pancake selections will fulfill any carb craving.  Conveniently located in the shadows of Fashion Square Mall."}
{"text":"My all time favorite breakfast spot. Like others said the wait can be aggravating but it has always been worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to eat. My wife has came here as long as she can remember and we've together been going here for several years. He food is always excellent, crepes are amazing, and the service is always top notch. They recently updated the decor inside, a great place for families and couples. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Breakfast: The one meal that gets no respect...  Most Yelpers rarely cover the most important meal of the day other than happy hour....  That said, breakfast in the restaurant world usually comes in the form of 2 genres: The over priced, pretentious, yet marginal quality hotel breakfast... ( Yes, the 15$ egg is alive and well in the USA ) or the greasy spoon so cheesy that even the most hard core of truckers would take a pass.  Happily, the \"Original Pancake House\" in Scottsdale AZ ( about as original as Rays Pizza in NYC ) delivers an extremely diverse and satisfying array of breakfast treats without the feeling you need a Penicillin shot after dining... all at a very reasonable price.   To be truthful, they have things on this menu that I have never seen in chain breakfast joints or snooty hotels...   I had the \"Ron's Special\" - egg scramble with carmelized onions, tomatoes, shrooms & cheese with potato pancakes... a truly satisfying meal!  Last trip here I ate twice... having the French Toast... then the berry crepes.  You couldn't get  a bad breakfast here if you tried!  Only negative, I found the coffee to be a little weak... but hey, food over coffee!  * Point of interest: You can write on the walls here... and yes, I have left my mark!"}
{"text":"Really disappointing. Wait for our food was interminable, even after we were seated, and food came out cold -- save for the bacon, which arrived 5 minutes after we started. The Swedish pancakes were almost inedible. Chewy and cold. Used to be one of my favorites. And, to top it off, it was really expensive AND the staff didn't seem the least bit interested when I suggested that the meal wasn't up to their standards. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Delicious. Great service. We left so full and happy we wanted to fall asleep. I had the french crepes and they were perfect ( and I make crepes ALL the time)! Our waitress was very friendly and checked on us a lot. I really appreciated the cheap kids menu. My only complaint is that I wish the crepes or pancakes came with one small side. I wanted two eggs and home style potatoes and that ended up making my meal $15 by itself. Also I wish they had hash browns but the home style potatoes were very tasty unlike other places! Maybe I'll try the potato pancake next time. I was a happy yelper getting breakfast for dinner!"}
{"text":"Love the food...the apple pancake took my son to heaven!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have gone to this location several times and the wait has never been too long and the food has always been doggy bag worthy..."}
{"text":"Impressed, friendly service, quick to bring out your food. About the best tasting bacon you can get and the pancakes are delicious."}
{"text":"OHOP.  Dutch babies. Waffles. Perfect poached eggs. Thick, crispy bacon. Delicious black coffee. Incredible inlets and smiling staff.  It is a tad pricey but quality isn't cheap."}
{"text":"Omelet was great! !! Pancakes and bacon horrible. ..hashbrowns with cheese on point. .."}
{"text":"Great food and service... Our breakfast place of choice over several others in Charlotte. Scrambled eggs are always fluffy, bacon is very good and the pancakes are awesome- blueberry, pumpkin etc.. Their so called \"hash browns\" are home fries- they are just ok. Wish they had shredded hash browns but the pancakes make up for them!"}
{"text":"Good food but a terrible experience. They won't seat you unless your entire party is there.  Cash only or local check. The rush you out so they can turn the tables as fast as possible. And in general the atmosphere is anything but relaxing. You feel like you don't even have time to enjoy your food."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast, and popular place!!!  We somewhat beat the rush--when we arrived, we were given a 20 minute wait time, but we were seated much quicker, more like 10 minutes.  I think for such a busy place, the service was excellent.  Our server, Rodney, was quick to check on our table and get our coffee and order - great server very tentative, and coffee cup was never empty.  I had Eggs Benedict and Buttermilk Pancakes.  You certainly don't go away hungry.  The Eggs Benedict were very good, eggs poached perfectly, and a really decent slab of Canadian Bacon.  My dining companion had strawberry crepes, which were good, but she wishes she went with the Eggs Benedict.  When leaving, the line was now out the door!  Glad we went when we did--get there early."}
{"text":"The wait here look pretty crazy but we were actually seated before the quoted wait time. That is always a positive.  After reading the reviews on what is good here, I decided to get an omelet and upgrade my pancakes. The people in my group ordered bacon and eggs.  Our server was really nice and answered all our questions and was patient with us while we decide what we wanted.  After placing our order, the food came out fairly quick I feel. My omlet looked kinda of weird at first but when I took a bite into it, I knew it will taste great. After i pretty much inhale my omlet, I then worked on my pancakes.  I went with the Pumpkin Pecan pancakes and the pumpkin flavor was really good. You know how when they flavor pancakes, the flavor is weak, NOT with these, These were very very good. I told my self, I would only eat two, but I ended up eating all three!  My buddies got the chocolate chip pancakes and he ate all three of his! He said they were really good.  All in all, don't let the long line outside scare you, it goes quick, and food comes out quick also. You would be in and out of there in no time! I will most definitely come back when I'm in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"First time there and my wife had the Dutch Baby and I had the Cobb Salad. The Dutch Baby with fresh fruit was outstanding. The Cobb Salad was excellent and I enjoyed it. Everything was fresh and the service was very good. Great meal and a good time."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Irish omelet is delish and the pancakes are always tasty. Mary is by far the best server I've had the pleasure to know."}
{"text":"Holy smokes! Portions are intense! Must try the German pancake - it's yum! We got the Nutella crepe, single serving & I had to take 3/4 of it home. It wasn't bad, but could have been cooked a smidge longer - the crepe was a little wilty. Omelettes are great. Potatoes are good. Service was ok. Refills took a little longer for a Tuesday morning with 1/2 full restaurant. Next time I definitely want to try the corned beef hash!"}
{"text":"Not a bad wait this morning, only 15 min.  Food was very good and service was excellent."}
{"text":"My family and I drove down to Champaign on our way to Florida. I had never been to this place, though they have quite a few locations in Illinois.  We had to wait for nearly 20 minutes for our table. Granted, there were seven of us, and we expected to wait for a bit.  The owner was very attentive, working alongside his employees and getting to know customers.   Our waitress was great. Attentive, punctual, fun, very kind, and personable. She would've been the best part of the experience, had my meal not been out of this world.  I had the Dutch with bananas and strawberries. Out of this world. The batter was light and fluffy, and the fruit was fresh. Not to heavy, and an exceptional sweet taste.   My brother had a skillet, which I tasted. Very good, great balance of eggs, meat and vegetables. Coffee was good too.   Portions were generous, pricing was decent.   The restroom was well kept.  The mix of people seems to consist of quite a few locals. We spoke to one woman from town, who had been going for breakfast there everyday for the last 35 years. Talk about commitment.  Great spot, homey feel, excellent food. I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Although the pancake syrup is very runny,  there is no lack of flavor.  The waffles are amazing and the fresh fruit that can be added to them is always tasty.  I have had the crepes a few time and never been disappointed.  The wait is always a LONG wait, but for good reason.  If you choose to come here, don't come starving because by the time you get seated you will be!!   I say, perfect timing!!   The wait staff is very friendly and ready to get your food to your table almost as soon as you order it.    Come here and discover the magic of the Original Pancake House!!"}
{"text":"Best pancakes you will ever have. Try no other if your looking for a clean friendly perfectly made pancakes."}
{"text":"Wandered off the strip and found this gem. Great breakfast items and great service! Ended up going back a couple more times during our trip. Only wish they were open later."}
{"text":"This place is my SPOT! They NEVER let me down. I've been a regular here for years...I get pretty much the same thing everytime either  A.-The Bacon Lovers with BANANA PANCAKES (add pecans) or  B.-The Strawberry Waffle  I don't know WHAT type of PIG these people use but...their bacon is RIDICULOUS.It's a thicker cut and MELTS in your mouth.My brother (the biggest bacon lover I know) describes it as \"bacon so good..it's worth the high blood pressure it will give you\".   My bf and bff LOVE the omelettes. They dont look like a regular omelette but a yellow fluffy pillow.Except these pillows might be oozing out cheese.  The waffle and pancakes here are....(bows head) the waffle is so light and GREAT..so are the pancakes. I haven't went to IHOP since I've been to this place.I LOVE my ORIGINAL PANCAKE HOUSE!  Take it from a regular..try NOT to go on the weekend and IF you order the bacon lovers TRY to share it instead of eating it all yourself.I did that once and went to sleep for 5 HOURS!!!"}
{"text":"Updated review:  gluten-friendly pancakes are not vegan or FODMAP friendly.  They include eggs, peanut oil, and milk.  For FODMAP, request eggs with no milk or spices in it."}
{"text":"Probably the best brunch spot in Madison. Friendly staff, delicious food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed to find out that they don't have neither steak nor gravy and biscuits.   On top of that, it takes the server forever just to bring beverages.  The syrup with the pancake runs like water pouring out.   Quite strange!   The potato hash tasted wired.  My sunny side up eggs came out undone, I had to send it back to have it recooked. Server clearly doesn't want to work much, we can't upgrade our side toast to French toast like other competitive breakfast places such as rise n' shine or bites. Won't be back for too many reasons!"}
{"text":"Not 2A friendly, didn't see the sign until I was leaving. The food is good though.  So all you Anti-2A supporters meet here for your rallies and to be victims for criminals who don't obey the law.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"GET THE APPLE PANCAKES!!! They are absolutely AMAZING!!!  There is enough for 2 as I could only finish half. The grits were spot on and the bacon was great. OJ tasted fresh squeezed (opinion only). The coffee was not bad just a little earthy for my taste. Reasonably priced. I will be back next time I'm in Charolette."}
{"text":"The banana pancakes are OFF THE HOOK!!!  Maple syrup was warm and think. The OJ had pulp but that's just a personal thing. Either way it tasted freshly squeezed!!!"}
{"text":"Just had the pecan pancakes. Nothing fancy, just delicious!  BTW, the bacon IS amazing."}
{"text":"The food is great. Everything is made fresh & natural. Service is very good and everyone is friendly. The downsides are that there's often a wait, and it's cash-only. If you can accept the bad, you'll appreciate food and service."}
{"text":"This place was PACKED.  On Mother's Day morning of all days, we showed up with a party of 7. The queue was huge. But, my sis had their text msg/mobile app setup, and we could track our progress to getting stacks of fried cakes.  The wait was maybe 15 minutes, not bad at all.  The food was great - this was better than your avg truck-stop-feel pancake and eggs joint.  They kept my coffee mug FILLED.  I ordered the apple waffle, and it was amazing.  Everyone left happy and full.  Would definitely recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's so affordable and great food. Maybe the best breakfast food I've ever had. The place is pretty cool looking. There may be a wait but they do a great job of getting you in. This is the place to go if you want breakfast food. There omelettes are massive."}
{"text":"I heard amazing things about this place so I think I walked in the door with my expectations a little high. It's just a breakfast joint that's on par with the others in town. Mad props to them for their choice of bacon. It's long thick sliced pieces and I love me some bacon!"}
{"text":"NICHOLAS CAGE sighting! He walked in with his son for pancakes as we were dining! AWESOME!!!  :)  4.5 stars. This O.P.H. is kind of wayyyy out there away from the Strip. I mistook this location for the closer one on Ft. Apache to our hotel (The Rio). It took us a while to get out there and with minimal sleep and rest after the finish of our Baker to Vegas run, we were starving and super tired.   I picked this place for breakfast and had great reviews and adda-boys from the 2 minivan carloads of friends that were hungry and attended breakfast this morning. Coffee, ginormous crazy hub cap sized omelets, pancakes and bacon were the stars of the morning on this visit. You can't go wrong with their pancakes, hence the name Original PANCAKE House.   The service was also good, our waitress was training another new waitress and seemed to be a pretty good trainer. Coffee, water and drinks were always topped off.   This may be an annual trip for breakfast after our runner crosses the finish line for the race.   Plenty of parking, next to a B of A if you need the ATM (I don't like using the casino ATMs so this was perfect for me), clean establishment. We were seated right away...a party of about 12-13."}
{"text":"When your looking for good food, great service, low prices go here.  Large portions!  Its a big place with lots of tables and service staff!  The food is great.  I actually took home my leftover pancakes!  lol The OJ was fresh squeezed, find that in a restaurant these days!  Im glad i found this gem"}
{"text":"Great food. This place was so solid, I went back there four days in a row. The prices were low. The service was super fast. I'm a fan of the hash browns and of course the pancakes. Little details like you could tell the OJ was fresh squeezed. Try the hot chocolate. Just top notch all the way."}
{"text":"To me breakfast is my most important meal of the day and this place does breakfast to its best!! living in Vegas at the time  while attending school for  Interior design, I decided to check this place out after hearing so many great things about it , not only in LV but in California .Wow Everything from there chocolate chip pancakes to there omelets are Amazing!! There omelets are fluffy and the size of my head,hard to finish, but just absolutely delisious.And there pancakes OMG!!Incredable I have since then tried choclate chip panckes one or two other place s and they just dont compare.It has been a while since i have been there but look forward to visiting once a gain"}
{"text":"I agree with Jen T. that the decor could use some work. It does feel pretty generic. The food and service have always been great. Our servers have always seemed happy with their jobs. The strawberry pancakes along with the chocolate chip pancakes are the best that I have ever had. The orange juice is also outstanding as they squeeze their own. The Dutch Baby is also excellent. We always make sure to take visitors to the pancake house. When I travel back to the Midwest, people that have visited us will often talk about the pancake house."}
{"text":"This place was great! The food was great! The portions were generous and the prices were reasonable! Our server Cedric was wonderful! He made sure that we had what we needed before our food arrived and then checked back once our food arrived to ensure we didn't need anything else. Great service, relaxed environment and we didn't have to wait! We will definitely be back! Order the potatoes! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Eggs.  Pancakes.  Fresh Fruit.  Probably cholesterol on a diner like dish, but WHOAAAA nelly!!!  OH SO GOOD!!!!!  It's the kinda place that you see in a Norman Rockwell vacation... And it's THAT good!!!!  Screw Mickeys.... OPH is da bomb!!  Bonus points if you order the 4 egg omelette that frankly will feed 3 people, and if you order it for you, you'll have a meal to go for days...  OH LAY OFF PEOPLE, I\"M A POOR STUDENT!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is better than going to an IHOP or Denny's but it isn't the best breakfast place in town.  I got the corporate run feel to it because breakfast for 3 people was $50.  I think I am just old fashioned or something but that just seems like too much...  I ordered the spinach crepes with hallandaise sauce.  It was actually very tasty.  It was a large portion and it was served with 4 potatoe pancakes.  My friends were far less impressed - their orders were;  eggs & bacon and eggs and canadian bacon.  --- No hashbrowns, no toast, no pancakes... an extra order of toast was $2.59!!!  Quite a few of the breakfasts were priced in the $11-$15 range... Yikes.  This place needs to throw some taters on the plate for crying out loud!"}
{"text":"Forget about IHOP and Perkin's because it's time for some REAL breakfast. The pancakes are amazing, especially the Dutch Baby. You've got to have strawberries with it. The corned beef hash is good as well. They also serve REAL cream to go with your coffee or tea, not milk or half and half. It is very busy in the weekends, so expect to wait for a seat. But it's worth the wait for some great breakfast in a comfy place-just like being at grandma's."}
{"text":"I intended to get there for a Sunday brunch.  Arrived late (around 1 PM) and there was still a wait.  That's a good sign.  The tables turned over pretty quickly and our party of four was seated in about 20 minutes.    Attentive waiter and good value.  How different can pancakes be?  I don't know what they do at this particular OPH, but the plain pancakes were amazing.  Definitely craving more today.  Hash browns were okay.  They're more home style with large chunks and kind of soft.  I happen to prefer mine more like Waffle House hashbrowns.  Eggs and sausage links were as expected.  The six year old in our party was a huge fan of the chocolate chip pancakes.  Fortunately he didn't finish all of them so I had the chance to try his.  I concur with his assessment.    There's an overflow parking lot across the street which has reserved spaces for the restaurant.  Expect to use it."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food, 2 stars for the service.  Averages out to a 3 right?  We had a waitress that must have had a bad day. She was not friendly at all and she did a not so good job of keeping the coffee full.  I saw a woman from another table carry her empty cup up to the front to ask for more coffee.  If in the area, I would give this place another try."}
{"text":"Great family style restaurant!  The breakfast selections are always \"hug\"-quality (you just want to hug the cook after tasting one of the best breakfasts you'll ever experience in your life)!  The staff has always been friendly yet professional, and that restaurant is literally spotless everytime we visit.  I've become used to the cash or check policy they have, as every meal has been exceptional... Worth the trip to the cash station, in my opinion!  One of the best places in Madison to start your day!"}
{"text":"We usually get the same few dishes over and over: the strawberry/French crepes, the Swedish pancakes, cherry crepes, the Dutch Baby, or the Apple pancake, and bacon or sausage. Everything is great. The service is pleasant and accommodating, and if you don't come Sat/Sun-after-church times it's not a long wait.  However, I noticed in the past months they've switched to half-n-half instead of heavy cream for their coffee. There are other little shortcuts here and there, like not asking if you want sour cream with your cherry crepes. I know the economy isn't great, but I think it's a mistake to cut corners. I think it's better to raise prices.   Overall, friendly and efficient, generous with coffee refills."}
{"text":"Cash only so be forewarned. They like to promote their in house ATM but that's got a nice service fee on it. The pancakes are solidly good from this chain, the service ranges from average to slightly above. The decor needs work and lots of it. I am used to this chain in a different setting (http://www.walkerbros.net) and it doesn't need to be this good but it get to middle of the road if they tried."}
{"text":"Original Pancake House is always packed on Sundays so it was nice to see only an 18-25 minute wait time online. I was able to put my name in online and have 10 minutes to check in at the door. Once I checked it I only waited 10 minutes, nice! Once seated, service wasn't great! My waiter has a few tables and we all seemed to be looking for him. I ordered the Hash Browns and Eggs, which comes with 3 original pancakes and I added a side of Bacon. My order was delivered with no pancakes. I asked about the pancakes and he looked at me strangely. Needless to say three pancakes were delivered cold.  They must have been sitting out for a while.  My coffee and water went unfilled, and when I asked for some more sugar packets I never received them. As for the food, it was good, although I do wish my pancakes were fresh/hot! I have been to the Metropolitan location and will stick to that one, seems the service and food are better there."}
{"text":"Be prepared for a wait on any Saturday or Sunday, but the Original Pancake House is worth it.  This location can be deceiving from the outside, but is actual vey large and they move tables pretty quickly, so your wait may not be too long.  The service is great, it appears their is someone always around to pour you some extra coffee, grab you a napkin or really anything. As for the food, the menu can be overwhelming, but offers a lot and a can satisfy any and all guests pallets. I ordered the Bacon Breakfast special, eggs, bacon, hash browns and 3 pancakes. Yes, it is a lot. I subbed my bacon for half bacon half sausage and they were able to accommodate that request. Eggs, cooked perfectly, but the pancakes made my breakfast. I guess that is why their name is what it is. There pancakes are light and fluffy...amazing! This will definitely a go to breakfast spot for me!"}
{"text":"I love the Original Pancake House... I love it!  Eversince I went to my first one in Charlotte, NC i fell in love with this place. Since then everytime I go to a city with an OPH in it I make it a point to have breakfast there. The OPH in Vegas is no exception. It is a great place to have breakfast, and a welcome escape from the Strip.  Their omelettes are amazing... I have yet to figure how they get them to be so crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. They make them from a lot of eggs and that means they are big.  The pancakes are great and their house specialty the Dutch Baby is awesome. And did I mention they serve freshly squeezed orange juice... nice!  Check this place out.  p.s. For those of you who are tourists, make sure you have a way to get back to the Strip as finding a cab out there or calling one is no simple task."}
{"text":"Busy, busy, busy - - that was our last wknd experience here. Still awesome.... service was great, but on a wknd be prepared to wait.   I was surprised how fast it went for us - - we were only a party of two.   It's an OPH, so pretty much just like all the others. I like the eggs, bacon, and pancake combo. Extra crisp bacon.... my husband is currently hooked on the Apple pancake thingy. Yeah... it is very good!! Tons of cinnamon and sugar.   The one thing different about this location is: a) CASH only b) it's attached to a ghetto looking Motel 6 or something.  c) Parking can be tough, so consider it a start to a good day if you score a spot"}
{"text":"I love... Breakfast! Especially when it's at an OPH.   The reviews here were not the usual stellar ones that I'm used to for OPH's, but I was willing to give it a shot! This location was much closer to my hotel than the other location in Madison.   I arrived promptly at 7:30am when they opened up...no waiting around for me. A small number of us hungry eaters were there.   Take note: Cash only. (I still don't get this....) But whatever. :)  I ordered the usual pancake, eggs, meat combo - - tasty! I had the coconut cakes. This time they were more baked into the batter, i think at other OPH locations it's less mixed and more sprinkled on the top.   It's been a week that I've been here.. and I remember thinking that it was just okay for an OPH. But now that I'm writing this, i'm kinda craving their pancakes. ha! I'll probably go back... don't have to twist my arm that hard."}
{"text":"I had the country ham and eggs with the 3 pancakes. It was pretty good! My wife got one of the omelets and it was just ok. I would definitely recommend the pancakes. Quick and efficient service as well."}
{"text":"I try the Original Pancake House in every city I can. This one is right up there with some of the best one's I've been too. Clean and great staff...and of course, their breakfast menu is a must have experience!!! Excellent pancakes and swedish cakes!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this location since I was a kid and it has been fairly consistent except.... I guess some of the magic that it had when I was younger went away when I realized it was a chain and also probably since everywhere started serving 'specialty' pancakes. The BF and I went this morning and everything was fine. We waited about ten minutes, got a booth (almost unheard of on a Sunday with a party of 2!), and sat down. We both got coffee, which was fine, but the BF seems to think that they used to serve real cream with coffee... now it's the standard half and half, but I do not share that memory. I got a short stack of banana pancakes and some home fries and he got the bacon pancakes. His pancakes were good. Mine were alright... the coconut they put on top was a little hard so it gave it a weird texture, but the cakes were good. The 'tropical' syrup that comes with it is pretty gross and I'm glad I tasted it on a small piece before putting it all over the cakes... it tasted like orange rinds.... not my thing. The home fries were tasty, but overpriced at 3$ in my opinion. Overall this place is good, just not great... still way better than Denny's.   PS the rules really aren't that big a deal... maybe people can actually talk to each other over a meal *shock!*"}
{"text":"Service was good. I was very disappointed in my breakfast. I had potatoes pancakes. They were greasy and had no flavor. The applesauce was amazing!  I should have sent them back - my bad. I've had breakfast here before and it was good. I will go back but will stay away from their potatoes pancakes."}
{"text":"The German pancake is the bomb, better than the regular American pancakes which were still good, fluffy and soaked up the syrup wonderfully. I like the small touches of serving warm syrup and the powdered sugar with lemon to make a glaze on the German pancake. Omelette was huge. Enjoyable and reasonable prices. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I hate reviewing a place when I've only been once, but the quality of ingredients was so bad and the level of cooking so apparently awful that I'm pretty confident in reviewing it. I can't complain about how my Denver omelette was cooked, but the only thing I tasted was the salt and hot sauce I added. The peppers, ham, onion and cheese were merely textural additions to the pale fluffy eggs. My friend's eggs Benedict is what inspired this review and how I knew the level of cooks was sub par. Aside from the crappy English muffins and Canadian bacon one of his poached eggs was half gone, just a piece of egg white, covered in a broken hollandaise. \"Broken\" meaning the butter didn't emulsify with the eggs. Instead of a rich buttery sauce, it was greasy with clumps of overcooked egg. Yuck. Who let that slide??"}
{"text":"I went here on many drunken and late nights at school! The pancakes here are really good, especially if you get the ones with the straweberries on them! The service is usually really friendly too!"}
{"text":"This regional chain is the place to go to eat gigantic portions of good-enough pancakes and eggs surrounded by senior citizens and high school students.  The standout here is the surprisingly tasty, lacy-thin potato pancakes, which they serve, correctly, with apple sauce and sour cream.  The bacon pancakes are another welcome innovation.   Things to be aware of:  1.  Go weekday mornings to avoid long waits. 2.  Cash only.  3.  Many items can be ordered in half-portions (otherwise known as \"normal-sized portions\") making the OP an even cheaper place to have breakfast."}
{"text":"Used to go to the location in north Phoenix and Greenway and 7th street. Lovely restuarant, great food, always our choice for breakfast. Went to this one a couple of years ago and will never go back. Small, cramped, the corned beef hash, which used to be my favorite, was terrible, and staff was rude. Not a fancy location by a Motel 6, but a lot of \"Scottsdale attitude\" being tossed around. Very, very disappointing!"}
{"text":"It was my genius idea to eat a late breakfast here before heading across the street to get all wine-up at the Great Grapes Festival.  Of course I didn't think of the fact that at 10ish it's packed with people who just finished the cancer walk (the confusing part is this is not the closest one to uptown...).  I was pretty impressed with the quick turnover of the tables.  The menu is big (literally and figuratively).  They don't offer the typical breakfast combo of eggs, meat, toast/biscuit, hushbrown/grits. But you bet it that pancakes come with almost everything. I ended up with the corned beef hash breakfast, which come with 2 eggs and pancakes.  I love mixing my corned beef hash with grits, so I had to order a side of grits (boooo!).  My sweet tooth of a boyfriend ordered an oven baked apple pancake with chocolate chips added.  It's way more exciting to write about his food... that thing is huge and thick, and it doesn't look like a pancake at all.  More like bread pudding or something.  It's not too sweet, but sweet enough that you don't have to put syrup if you don't want to.  He managed to finish it (with a little help from me).  I swear I don't know how he stays so freaking tiny.  My breakfast on the other hand was ok.  The corned beef hash was not as salty as others.  The pancakes weren't as good as I would have expected from a place named \"Original Pancake House.\"  It's a little mushy if I have to say.  I do have to say I wasn't happy with the service at first.  The lady wasn't exactly friendly.  I was without silverwares for longer that I should.  I know this place was crowded, but it's always crowded, so that's not good enough of a reason. But oh well... I was told to chill, so chill I did haha  Apparently I'll be back for their seasonal pumpkin pancakes... let's guess whose idea that is??"}
{"text":"Stopped off here after a pickup at the airport. My friend & both enjoyed our food - we had pancakes & egg.  The waitress was a trainee & was very friendly & efficient."}
{"text":"I have many fond memories of the Hyde Park OHOP, where I was a regular many years ago. The Madison OHOP was a great reminder of why I loved it so much. They did a great job of handling a large party on Easter morning. As always, the coffee was immediate and copious, though average in quality. They accommodated various special requirements - eating with somebody with a gluten intolerance in a pancake house was a first for me, but they handled it well. The corned beef hash was particularly good. I wish we had had room for the Swedish pancakes and 49'er flapjacks!"}
{"text":"A little bit of a wait was worth it.  Great place for the family.   Don't sleep in too late on Sunday!!!!"}
{"text":"So, finally last Saturday, I went here for breakfast with my husband. There was a long queue, which I had expected but it was way long than my expectation. We got so hungry that we had to grab a smoothie from smoothie king nearby, which was not that great. Anyways, after waiting for 45 minutes, we were seated. We ordered oven baked veggie omelette and strawberry pancakes. Food arrived in 10-15 minutes. Omelette was fluffy and well seasoned. I would have preferred way less cheese but otherwise it was good. Now, I love pancakes and since the name of this establishment itself contains pancakes in it, I expected them to be awesome. But, I was disappointed. I have had better. They were not as fluffy as I would have liked. They were just ok. Service on the other hand was nice."}
{"text":"Mmmm. I love this place. Their pancakes have changed slightly from before but they still taste great. I've gotten their farmers omelet and others containing sausage and vegetables. They taste so fresh and are super fluffy. Get the banana pancakes! Yummmm. Topped with bananas and all the things. These are delicious! Friendly staff but definitely expect a wait on the weekends."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in town that I can see.  Pancakes are great especially the Dutch babies and apple ones.  Although I am not a fan of baked omelettes this place has the formula.  The crepes are delicious and traditional breakfast are well-done.  Service is quick but nice.  Avoid church going prime time because of line.  Good coffee too.  Hope this one doesn't disappear like the others."}
{"text":"Today it's 5 stars because our wait was only 10 minutes and the food and service was just excellent.  We didn't wait long for our food and were always topped off with fresh coffee.  Spouse ordered the most excellent omelet topped with mushroom sherry sauce.  He was very happy.  My bacon was thick and crispy.  Freshly squeezed orange juice is a real treat!  Highly recommend a visit here."}
{"text":"This review is now 3 years late, but better late than never? Anyways, below was my draft so it was exactly how I felt when ate there, so I'll say its still accurate.   I loooooooove pancake house! I visit this location quite often as its close to my apartment. Its generally pretty packed but the front keeps things going like a well oiled machine. The most Ive waited is like 10 minutes. The banana pancake is my favorite and there is not one thing I have tried here I don't like. Its fairly priced, delicious, great service. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place on the weekends besides the fact that it is jam packed with people so on the weekend get up at about 7 am to get a decent spot. The FRENCH TOAST is sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon.YUM!"}
{"text":"For you bacon lovers, they have bacon pancakes!   The restaurant is in a busy location but this was not a problem when I arrived. I like the warmness of the restaurant.  I ordered two buckwheat pancakes and two eggs over hard.  Buckwheat is a type of flour that is supposed to be pretty health.  I enjoyed every bit of the meal as it was just enough for my stomach.  Service was fast and courteous so we were able to run in, grab a quick bite, and be on our way.  I look forward to my next visit to OPH; the location, however, is far from home."}
{"text":"I tried to have breakfast inside (with me, myself, and I) but the wait was 15-20 minutes.  At least, that is what she told everyone who came in the door.  In any case, being impatient and super hungry, I ordered to go.  The buckwheat pancakes were a hit with me.  I ordered the special apple pancake.  It was heavy but looked good.  It is more like a baked apple dessert.  I can't tell you how it tasted because I opted not to have any.  I am confident It will be devoured by someone in the house with some vanilla bean ice cream!  Oh, while I was outside walking in the lot, the staff member came out and hand delivered my order.  That is excellent customer service and she did well to remember my face, as well as another customer's whose order she delivered to their waiting car."}
{"text":"I discovered this place by accident when I was visiting in  Vegas. My sister and I split the gouda and spinach omelet, which , by the way, is HUGE! Crispy on the outside, and fluffy filled to capacity with yummy smoked gouda and spinach. THE BEST!! It was so delicious I would of gladly stuffed myself and eaten the entire thing. The next time I was in town I got one all to myself (Yummy!) and my daughter ordered the chocolate chip pancakes, which are good, but can put you in a sugar coma. Anyway, my five year old asks if she can try a bite of my omelet and she loved it! The kid scarfed down half of it. Damn, I may never get one all to myself. Next time, it will all be mine! The service was mediocre, but I can totally deal for food this great."}
{"text":"Quick. Delicious. Exceptionally friendly.  The cherry crepes were out of this world. Possibly the best crepe we've had.  The hash browns (traditional German style, not shredded) were \"not as good as Oma's, but close!\" As this IS the Original Pancake House, the pancakes did not disappoint. They were fantastic.  Our server, Jesse, was great. Attentive, personable, and on his game!! A great experience and we will be sure to return!"}
{"text":"Pancakes tasted horrible. Waiter didn't even show up to our table. Talked to manager and he didn't do anything about It! Never going there again."}
{"text":"When we don't have our son with us this my husband and I's favorite breakfast spot. Our son has a peanut allergy and they cook most of their pancakes in peanut oil, which is probably why they are so delicious.  I love just getting their bacon and egg meal. The bacon is thick cut and so good. I always get the side of pancakes, so fluffy and melt in your mouth good. We also order a side of hash browns to share. My husband either gets the chilli omelette or the tex mex omelette. They are huge and we always have left overs. They also have amazing strawberry pancakes with tons of fresh whipped cream.  They do only take cash but have an ATM on site. If you are looking for traditional breakfast food this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Best breakfast around by far! Try to get there early on Sundays, it gets very busy around 1030/12; people are packed outside waiting for a table. Promise you the wait is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Went to one in our old hometown numerous times throughout 20 years and loved it there.  So it was a little bit of nostalgia hitting us.  My hubby had the chorizo omelet and the tropical pancakes and loved every bite.  I had the \"egg supreme (beaters\" omelet w/ lots of veggies.  I had some great whole grain toast w/ it.  A bit burnt, but still good.  Coffee and waitstaff were great and the hostess was a doll.  It was a 45 minute trip for us to get there-but it was a nice treat."}
{"text":"Though I usually steer clear of restaurant chains, I can make an exception for this particular chain since it serves up fantastic breakfast items. They have a rather extensive menu with all items priced below $10 with most items falling in between the 6 to 8 dollar range.  I generally prefer savory breakfast items over sweet so on this visit I got an order of the Florentine crepes with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. I'm not exaggerating when I say that their hollandaise sauce is one of the best I've tasted outside of Paris (Paris Hotel in Las Vegas that is). The sauce was smooth and lusciously rich. The mushrooms and spinach inside the crepes were plentiful. My glass of OJ had the right balance of tart and sweetness which was a nice accompaniment to my crepes. It was without a doubt, the best breakfast I had had in awhile.  The restaurant was very busy during our visit so we anticipated that service would be on the slow side. However, our server never appeared frazzled, inpatient, or rude. Service was excellent and served with a smile.    Be aware that unlike their South Park location which closes at 9pm daily, the Midtown location closes at 2:30pm during the weekdays and 3pm on weekends. Get there early because parking is scarce and there tends to be a wait for seating whether it be as short as 10 minutes or as long as an hour. Trust me though, the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"They serve apple pancakes here that are pretty special. It's an innovative baked creation.    Then again, this place does things a little differently. Not like IHOP.    I highly recommend the cherry crepes.... And I don't even like cherries. They just taste amazing!!"}
{"text":"OMGEEERDD! I have found my new cheap, hungover breakfast/brunch eats! I have been wanting to try this place for a while and I wasn't disappointed with what I found! We arrived around noon, it was packed but, we were seated within a couple of minutes. Our servers were so nice and welcoming, so different from the recurring, unpleasant experiences at IHOP. The entire menu looked good, it was so hard for me to choose. We ended up ordering the western omelette with a side of Bermuda pancakes for an upcharge as well as a fajita crepe. Food was brought out promptly and hot. I LOVED the Bermuda pancakes (3 with the combo and 6 in a full order)! The pecans gave it great texture and the tropical maple syrup had a sweet fruity flavor, almost like passion fruit. The bananas and coconut shavings also provided for a wonderful texture. The western omelette and fajita crepes were very hearty, the crepe was my favorite out of the two. I wasn't a fan of the Spanish sauce that was included in the entrees, it was more like a tomato-y marinara sauce. I think the two of us would have been set between the western omelette - Bermuda pancakes combo, it was a lot of food, will do this next time. The hot chocolate was also delicious and served in their OPH mugs, very cute. And, refills on hot chocolate, score! And and, the hot chocolate and pancakes come with house-made vanilla whipped cream, double score. Egg whites for omelettes come at an additional charge.  We left stuffed with a tone of food to take home. The best experience I've had at a low cost breakfast joint. I will definitely be back, hell, I wish they were open longer so I could go after work. Original Pancake House knows how to work it."}
{"text":"The gf and I came here for the first time the other day. The definitely live up to their name, as the pancakes were dope. I got two eggs over easy, smoked ham, and 3 fresh strawberry pancakes. It was cheap and had good coffee, coffee is a big deal to me. Anyway, highly recommend, the service was very good; just remember to be as kind to your servers as you would like to be treated."}
{"text":"Very great restaurant! Got here right when it opened and there were people lining up to eat already. The servers were very nice and very quick with our food. The pancakes aren't large but they are still fluffy and filling - the syrup is very sweet. The omelettes were very large and delicious. They also have fresh fruit! This is a breakfast restaurant I'd urge anyone to try."}
{"text":"My friend and I have been here a few times for breakfast, and had a good meal each time. The wait is not bad at all, if there is one, for a Sunday morning, which is important to me since I sure do get grumpy when I've not been fed!   The coffee is good, the juice is good. I've had eggs, sausage, pancakes, toast, hashbrowns. All good. The poached eggs I had today were particularly good - cooked the perfect amount. My friend once tried the apple pancake which was crazy, and tasted much more like dessert than breakfast. It was delicious, don't get me wrong, but not a breakfast food in my opinion. If you like really sweet stuff though you'll like it.  The service is friendly but sometimes tough to find someone as they tend to be running around.  I don't know that I'd rave about it as the best breakfast place EEEEEVER but I like that it's not packed and has good food."}
{"text":"This place is always packed on Sunday mornings, we finally decided to see what they hype was all about. YES, WAIT IN LINE! You will NOT be disappointed. I ordered the Dutch baby pancake with sliced strawberries and bananas. It comes with powdered sugar and lemon wedges. GET THE APPLE SYRUP. My daughter got the Gluten free granny smith apple pancakes. She said they were fantastic! but that apple syrup, it was the perfect paring to the fresh apples on the pancakes.....and my dutch baby!  We got there around 10 am and only waited about 25 min for a table."}
{"text":"WOW! first time visiting and the place was packed on a Thursday at 10:50am and rightly so. We were seated quickly and had our drink order taken within 5 mins.  We ordered and within 20 minutes were served our omelets, 4 egg baked, along with hash browns, pancakes and toast. Delicious and servings were double the size of any other place!! The omelets are baked not fried and light and fluffy. The syrup is REAL maple make here in WI. The jam was authentic berry jam with seeds and real whipped butter. The bathrooms are VERY clean and wells stocked with soap and paper towels. The restaurant is also very clean. We paid $30 for 2 omelets, hash browns, pancakes, toast, coffee and ice tea. We tipped $7 because it was a great experience. They're open until 1pm weekly and 2pm on weekends."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if I could. I went there this morning and ordered strawberry pancakes and the strawberries were rotten. We asked the waitress about the strawberries. She said that they just looked that way and they had tasted them and they were ok. The strawberries had no firmness and were mush. the cashier asked how the meal was and we told him, and he said sorry but made no effort to help correct our order. they have no customer service or stand behind their food.   We will never return and have much better service at the location on University Avenue. The restaurant should not put up signs asking for Yelp reviews if they do not care about the quality of food they provide."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place in Phoenix/Scottsdale, BY FAR!  I know it's technically a chain and there are original pancake houses everywhere, but it's great. You can't go wrong with good 'ol fashion pancakes, I mean come on.   Their 49er flapjacks are on point! Thin and made perfectly.  When I don't get those, I indulge in just their basic pancakes - I haven't been anywhere else that can make basic pancakes as fantastic as this place.   They are usually pretty busy, but be patient, the wait is super fast!"}
{"text":"There are Pancakes for days here! Hence, the Pancake House...All manner of pancakes. This was my first visit. I ordered buttermilk pancakes but I ended up sharing the blueberry pancakes with my companion. I couldn't stop eating them! Light, fluffy, and flavorful. You can request a blueberry compost with them as well but I tell you, they can surely stand alone. If I return to this restaurant, I'll try a different flavor. I also, ordered egg whites, chicken sausage and hashbrowns. The waitress would not allow me to substitute the hashbrowns for breakfast potatoes. She was firm on that! The egg whites cost $1.50 to substitute in place of eggs and the $4.50 OJ was not worth that steep price tag. The chicken sausage was over cooked so I was disappointed there too. Our bill was $40.60! For a basic breakfast. Parking is limited in the lot but there is street parking nearby. The service was fine but in a small, quaint little breakfast place, I would have expected more personable service. I'm realizing that people don't value customer service like they used to. If you decide to try them out, order the blueberry pancakes. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Very community oriented. The portions are good the pancakes are a little smaller than the standard IHOP but there are a bigger variety of flavors. Definitely get the fresh squeezes orange juice and omelet."}
{"text":"Highly suggest the Potato Pancakes with a side of sour cream and apple sauce & the Spinach Omelet with gouda. The Mushroom omelet is also good. All delicious!!!!!   Great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place hands down in CLT!! I mean, it doesn't even serve alcohol and I'm here whenever I get the chance! I love it! The pancakes are the best I've ever had! And it's ALWAYS packed!!"}
{"text":"Tried to go there for breakfast this morning because we love the one near us in the Milwaukee area. We walked out before for even opening the second door for two reasons- 1) It smelled like vomit in the vestibule and 2) they take cash only. No debit or credit cards. Seemed very odd!"}
{"text":"Came in with wife & 2 LO's in tow and didn't have to wait long (great for a Sunday after church!). Super sweet waitress who was very accommodative. Good breakfast with my family."}
{"text":"Over the past 15 years I have to have been here at least 100 times (seriously). The food is always good quality, hot, the service courteous and efficient, and although I see that some people have commented that the portions are small, I have no idea what they are talking about. The salami and eggs (an oven baked omelet of sorts, and a personal favorite) is literally dinner-plate sized - it covers the whole darn plate. The dutch baby (also a favorite) is an eggy baked pancake concoction that is delicious slathered with butter, sprayed with fresh lemon juice, then sprinkled with powdered sugar. The hash browns are crispy and brown on the outside, soft on the inside, and cooked in one mass. Get cheese on top and they're even better. Yes, it isn't cheap, but with dozens of varieties of pancakes, waffles, omelets, crepes, etc to choose from, everyone I've ever taken has been happy at the end of the meal. The same staff has been here over the years, which tells me that they're treated well by the owners, and that means something to me too. I love this place, and plan to visit here at least 100 more times."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location and they did not disappoint. I walked in and was seated very quickly. I ordered the buckwheat pancakes, scrambled eggs, and turkey bacon (crispy). The food came out quick and hot. Surprisingly my turkey bacon was perfect . I will definitely come back to this location."}
{"text":"Restaurant review In Champlain this simply may be the most popular breakfast restaurant whether it's weekday or weekend's. There always significant amount of cars parked in the parking lot and I finally got to experience a breakfast here. Be prepared to wait long lines for seating some of the entrées take significantly long. When I ordered the Apple pancake I thought it would take no more than 30 minutes however it really did take the full 45 minutes. It was worth it but my wife who ordered the omelette ended up starving while she was waiting. The Apple pancake is a German pancake flip upside down coated with Apple slices and cinnamon. It's simply a taste of heaven that words can't even describe. I just wish that you didn't have to wait as long or you could order it online.  Pros: Best pancakes in town and friendly service  Cons: Long wait times an even longer depending on what you order  Hidden deals: Free coffee while you wait  Health code rating: B. Very clean and modern. It appears to have some temperature with the food issues. http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=690"}
{"text":"(Ate here for breakfast   today )  Didn't have to wait too long and  the food came out pretty quickly. The waitress was friendly and gave suggestions. The menu  is pretty large and offers lots of selections. I  Had the strawberry pancakes with thick sliced  bacon & eggs  and  a  French press.   Pancakes were delicious , bacon was a little \"fattier\" than I liked but it was ok. Overall everything  was delicious will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place is like a small mom and pop diner with the best crepe pancakes! Favorite is the Swedish crepe-like pancakes; other faves are their Dutch oven and of course their many varieties of pancakes!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite places on earth. Amazing breakfast you will not be disappointed. So many pancakes to choose from it's insane. This is absolutely the best breakfast place in Charlotte. They're chocolate chip pancakes and they're pumpkin pecan pancakes are outstanding."}
{"text":"The apple pancake is my favorite breakfast ever.  I wish they did not close so early so I could go more often."}
{"text":"Waiting in a physical line for food makes me feel like a fat pig going to a trough, so I do not like going here much.  When you finally strip your shame and decide to stand in a long food line full of elders and degenerates....the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"The key to this OPH is the hours it is open. The one in midtown closes down in the early afternoon, so if you are looking for some breakfast food later in the day, you are out of luck.  Another bonus of being able to go later in the day is that you do not have to wait in the the long lines, where everyone is sprawled all over the steps doing their best not to make eye contact with anyone else, so you feel like no one can judge you for your current condition.  I know it is the Original Pancake House, but damn...their bacon is good here.  It tastes great and is never soggy/flimsy.  If you are looking to avoid the 90 minute wait at Cheesecake Factory, just head across the street to this OPH for some solid bacon and eggs."}
{"text":"My first Original Pancake House experience was actually not at the Original location.  We would occasionally go the the one in North Phoenix.  In that one, all done with bright colors and modern touches - we liked the food, but we weren't too hip for some of their policies.  So we stopped going - and it appears that was the case with everyone else in North Phoenix too as that funky and cool looking location closed down about 3 years ago or so.    I've only been to this original location once, but found that they seemed a bit less tense on some issues they were more intense on others.  I went during a strong no-cell phone period apparently.  And when work called, which means I had to answer, several folks gave dirty looks.  While I totally get that folks shouldn't have obnoxious rings and talk loud into their ear pieces while walking through the restaurant, that policy seemed to encourage the dirty looks for answering a vibrating phone.  So... I haven't been back.    Based on Selby's review, I may have to go back one of these days because their food really was great - thus the 4 stars.   But I'll try to make sure it's a day when I don't expect to get any calls."}
{"text":"Let me cut to the chase- this place SUCKS. I've had better breakfasts and better service from McDonald's.   We ventured here on a Sunday morning when the wait at Hash House A Go Go was 45 min.- an hour. (Never again will I make that mistake- totally worth the wait at Hash House) and walked in to a seemingly unbusy breakfast joint-- ON A SUNDAY MORNING? Seriously, the shittiest places around are busy for weekend breakfast and the dining room here sat mostly empty which should've been my first clue.   After sitting for several minutes and not being acknowledged by anyone (because apparently, the skanky old waitress helping all the tables around us was not responsible for us) we finally had some has-been waitress mosey on over to take our drink order. We also gave our food order since we'd been there contemplating the menu for a good 15 minutes at this point.   The breakfast was uneventful. They gave me chewy bacon when I asked for extra crispy. I thought the whole thing was subpar. And to top it off, a $62 bill for 4 of us. You've got to be fucking kidding me... there's nothing worse than bland food, terrible service and a pricey bill to leave a bad taste in your mouth.   With the options of other breakfast joints in this town, this is not a place we'll be going to again."}
{"text":"A brunch place for the books: huge portions, fluffy pancakes, and long crowds. This place is AMAZING! If you don't believe me - look at the line of people waiting to eat here! And no, it's not because this is one of the only brunch/diner places in the area. It's because the food is delicious. I'll come here weeks back-to-back. The omelettes are fluffy and delicious. The portions for the omelettes are huge - they almost taste like stuffed omelettes. The Veggie and Santa Fe omelettes are amazing. If you want a smaller, but still filling, portion of eggs - order the scrambles. Also, what other can you go to where a short stack of pancakes IS the free side?! Yes, you get a short stack of pancakes with your eggs. So you never have to worry about choosing between sweet and salty ever again. All the pancakes are amazing - choose your topping and it'll come cooked fresh and fluffy with warm syrup! Also, the apple waffles. Yum. They're so light and fluffy!  This stellar American-themed diner is the way brunch should be: come hungry and leave in a good coma."}
{"text":"OK, so this wasn't exactly a gourmet experience, but I just needed to have some pancakes. This restaurant is a Northwest chain that has expanded through much of the U.S. I got bacon pancakes (i.e., bacon inside the pancakes) and a side order of sausage patties. The pancakes were heavy, the sausage not bad.  Too bad I didn't check here first - perhaps the house specialties (apple pancake or Dutch baby) are the way to go."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I'm rather upset with what just happened. The food here is excellent probably one of the best places to dine in Vegas, but as we all know it's about the Service! I've been a loyal customer of this location since it opened a few years back. Every single time that I have EVER dined here since opening I always grab a starbucks coffee and then I will go eat here because I don't like drip coffee. So today was no different than the other 50-60 times I've eaten here except I was denied a table due to the fact that I had my starbucks coffee. Listen, I understand having policies it's a business the issue here is consistency! If you have a policy than you have to stick to it not just simply implement it one random day because you feel like it and not on other days. I hope it was worth losing a loyal customer as I will definitely not be returning to dine here!"}
{"text":"Loved this place.. We started with their freshly squeezed tomato juice and grapefruit juice and they were thick and delicious.. We ordered their Swedish pancakes and meat lover's omelette ( which came with 3 buttermilk pancakes)..   The Swedish pancakes were unlike the regular pancakes.. These were more on the lines of crepes (not something we like) but this was delicious.. It was served with lingonberry sauce and whipped butter and the combination was divine!  The meat lovers omlette was huge and extremely filling (imagine an omlette made with 4-5 eggs!) The buttermilk pancakes were the best I've ever had.. Unlike the pancakes you usually get at Ihop or other such places! I'd surely go back just to have the pancakes again..   Expect a 15-20 mins wait time if you arrive post 8:30-9:00 AM on weekends!"}
{"text":"Great service (waitress was in training and everything still came out quickly and correctly); delicious pancakes (we got our usual order and it was done to perfection); clean; no wait!  I don't understand why this place would have less than 4-5 stars - it is exactly as advertised...an original pancake house like we have been visiting since childhood. I can't wait until my son is old enough to join in the deliciousness."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed OPH. Everything was delicious. The bathroom were clean and I was able to get a great parking spot. The pricing of the food was great as well. I was looking for a place that was great for kids and I feel like it is. The atmosphere was very kid friendly. Our server was very attentive and made sure that we had everything that we needed. The manager walks around to make sure that everyone is okay and that's a fine touch, I even seen him cleaning tables and to me that was awesome. Overall great experience, awesome price and clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awful service. We actually just walked out a few minutes ago. I asked for a straw for my drink and it was thrown at me along with the waiter stating \"here's more so I don't need to be asked again\". Really?! Had a wonderful experience our first visit a few weeks ago but now I will always have a sour taste for this place due to our service today! Be wary of the service!"}
{"text":"Love love love the eggs Michael here. The potato pancakes served with are crispy and not too salty. MMMM.  And the crepes are delicious as well. Have yet to have a bad experience here."}
{"text":"I went on a Monday morning and the place had customers but it wasn't super busy. It took some time to order because the menu was different from the ones in Cali. Finally, we decided on Pecan Waffles and Corned Beef Hash. The food came out faster than it took to decide.  The pecan waffles were yummy! The waffle was fluffy and a little bit sweet just how I like it.   The corned beef hash looked like they opened a can of Libby's and then barely warmed it up in a pan. I have to say Libby's taste much better. It was nothing like the corned beef hash at the California locations.  I definitely will be back just for pancakes and waffles. I might take a chance on other breakfast meats but I would stay away from the corned beef hash."}
{"text":"Best Breakfasts Ever!!  I couldn't help myself and stopped in twice last week, and I actually tried a couple of items I'd never ordered before. Seating was no problem either morning since I arrived not long after they opened.  The first day I was craving veggies, so I ordered an omelette with spinach and cheese. It arrived piping hot, and it was HUGE. It was very fluffy and loaded with lots of fresh spinach just as I was hoping. It was served with a side of their delicious pancakes, although I hardly had room to do eat more than a few bites of them.  The second time I'd had buttermilk pancakes on my mind, and Original Pancake House definitely has the best, so I decided to go there again. They had bacon pancakes and blueberry pancakes on the menu, so I compromised and ordered a short stack of blueberry bacon pancakes to satisfy both my savory and sweet cravings. The combination was awesome, and I almost managed to finish them.  I have never been disappointed at Original Pancake House. I think I'll go again this week and try the Swedish pancakes..."}
{"text":"I have some fond memories of eating at one of these in Las Vegas as a kid.  A recent trip to the Scottsdale location didn't live up to those memories. My food (bacon waffle) was good -- don't get me wrong -- but it wasn't worth the price. The service was pretty rude/blah/cold. I probably won't go back to this location."}
{"text":"My family came into town from Raleigh and heard about this place so we had to try it.  Let me start off by saying our server wasn't that attentive and he did forget my coffee and orange juice (seems as if he was busy people watching as opposed to serving his table). The atmosphere is mediocre I mean it's pancake house and people were turning tables quickly to accommodate everyone but for it to be so \"famous\" I expecting more.  When our food came it was a regular breakfast but the corned beef hash was serious!!  I love corned beef I grew up on it and this was amazing.  All in all if your looking for a quick hot cup of coffee and some eggs this is the spot."}
{"text":"So yeah, this place is so famous and is serving such a good pancake so if you come later than earlier, you have to expect to wait for about 15 to 20 minutes to get a spot. But, it's all worth waiting. Their orange juice is fresh! the dutch baby is delish. I specifically like their waffle. I've tried their pecan, strawberry and coconut waffles and the later is my favorite. Coconut waffle is just unique and it comes with lemon syrup.  My brunch companions today loved their choice. One had apple caramel, the other had strawberry crepe. The crepe is the richest one and can fix your sweet tooth carving."}
{"text":"Best 49'er flapjacks!! Reminds me of sourdough pancakes from Jsckson Hole WY. Came across the valley and will come again!!"}
{"text":"I came in today with my fiancé because I haven't been here in over a year. I adore the big Apple Cake. It has always been absolutely incredible, fresh, soft and delicious.  Today it was stale and disgusting. It was overlooked and almost burned on the top. The Apple cake always take longer. It came out in like 5 min. I'm pretty sure we got someone's old or misordered item. It tasted like the chefs \"pre cooked\" and then reheated or something. I've worked in restaurants my whole life, so I know it wasn't fresh.  Bethany was our server 3-4-17 middle booth on right side of entrance. She never asked us how anything was, but she did her \"job\" . Poor customer service though. I was starving so I ate the apple Cake and didn't complain, but I'm very disappointed . I raved about the apple Cake to my fiancé and we were both nothing short of dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Omelettes that have killed lesser men than me.  Otherwise, pretty standard fare.  Great if you're hung-over.  Which you probably are, you drunk."}
{"text":"Fast service. Thick bacon slices yum! Sunday morning, had to wait for about 25-30 minutes but it was worth it. Once we got in the service was speedy. I'd say better than IHOP for sure. The orange juice is fresh squeezed and tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"On our last visit here (Never EVER AGAIN), wifey found a Short and Curly in her crepe.  Luckily she didn't eat any of it yet.  Eff you, OPH!   NPH Would NEVER Do that!"}
{"text":"Place is a bit pricey but they serve you quality food and the only breakfast in Las Vegas that has a nice strong cup of coffee!"}
{"text":"Best food but cranky service which somehow fits the ambiance so I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but the wait for an omelette and some French toast was long, it's also really small inside"}
{"text":"As I entered the restaurant I was afraid I'd be disappointed as it wasn't the \"diner\" feel I expected; somewhat, but not exactly old school as I expected  However, the food was great! Some of the BEST pancakes I've ever had. The portions are HUGE! My son ordered bacon-lover's breakfast and it came with 7 pieces of thick-sliced bacon. Service was great also--more of the old school \"how ya doin sweetie\" from the waitress that I expected. Don't be fooled by the somewhat generic ambience. The food is way above standard."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!! It took too long to get our drinks, napkins and utensils. Not to mention we couldn't get our waitress' attention and when she brought our napkins they were dirty. Not the cleanest of restaurants either. The food was ok, nothing special. Loved seeing what they had to offer in their menu but disappointed when it came out. The bacon was the best thing."}
{"text":"Lovely brunch experience. It is a family own traditional pancake house. Every server is very very nice with smile face.  The coffee is free and cream together with the coffee is kind of nice. Though it is free, it is not cheap ones. The fresh orange juice is delicious. You could feet the orange in your mouse. $3 / bottle  The strawberry waffles are both beautiful and delicious. The egg Benedict is overall good but the egg is a little cover over. Every entree is very very big size. By the way, only cash and checks are accepted. No card please"}
{"text":"Man oh man.... How I missed this place. Ever since they closed up shop in Green Valley Ranch, I have been yearning for some Dutch Baby pancakes. Something about that baked pancake goodness and the option to put some powered sugar and a squeeze of lemon takes it to a whole new level. But off my tangent on awesome pancakes and on to the review.   The restaurant is located  in a strip mall like any other run of the mill restaurant which allows for plenty of parking. Our server was quite cheery and very attentive. The food was superb as always and was worth the drive over from the other side of town to eat breakfast. Next time I am in the area, you can bet I will stop by to get my pancake fix as they are the best in town."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed having breakfast here. We were a little concerned with the wait time when we pulled up b/c it was extremely crowded, but we only had about a 4-5 mins wait after we put our name in which was surprising and excellent at the same time. The service was fast and friendly here also. This is a definite must hit spot for breakfast if staying in the downtown area."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Charlotte for Strawberry Pancakes!! The fruit is fresh sliced...not sitting in a pre-packaged \"syrup\" base. The whip cream is made fresh in house and the Kona French Press coffee is a delight!  If you are going with the regular's for a mid morning b'fast on a Saturday..plan to wait....a while."}
{"text":"We had brunch here on Saturday. It was kind of a mixed bag, to be honest. I know, I know, it's a Pancake House, but we were encouraged by the good reviews. I'll start with the good and work my way from there. I had the Fresh Vegetarian omelette (see picture). I loved it, and couldn't finish it because it was ginormous. I loved how it was filled with all the fresh veg they promised and the sautéed mushrooms and sharp cheddar. It was baked in the oven, which made the eggs super fluffy. Everyone who waited on us, from seating to serving was super friendly. If your coffee mug was half full, they were all over it. Brett had the mushroom omelette (pictured). It's filled with mushrooms and smothered in their mushroom sherry sauce. I almost ordered that myself because the description sounded appealing. However, we suspect there is chicken stock in the sauce, so vegetarians will want to avoid it. It will wreak havoc on your system later, in addition to not being a vegetarian sauce. We assumed it'd be based on mushroom stock. Brett got a side of pancakes, which were perfect. You'd sort of expect that at the pancake house. I got wheat toast, which was stone cold and quite chewy. Only a thick layer of the whipped butter and the (ugh) packets of smuckers jam could make it edible. We both had coffee, which is not good coffee. I'm seeing those hideous all-in-one folgers packets Sysco would provide being used is some giant percolator urn. The inside of the place could be described as rustic, if you squint. They could really stand to paint the walls with a warm, inviting color that isn't cold white, buy some art, and ditch the plywood benches. I liked the idea of the hand-done stencils and painting here and there, but they need to find someone who knows what they're doing. We're not likely to return until they update their look and stop using something like Sysco foods. They may not have much choice in suppliers, but perhaps chains could come to understand that cans and packets just aren't going to cut it anymore."}
{"text":"Ok food. Ok setting. Ok pricing.   You get what you pay for  and it's certainly something you won't be craving for afterwards.  Mostly pancakes and waffles. Very limited choices on meat dishes. Just bacon and sausage links and patties. Coffee is okay, something you could definitely make at home taste better."}
{"text":"This is an amazing treat for breakfast or lunch. Not too fancy, it's very homey. Pancakes are delicious, perfect recipe, served any way you want. My go-to has been small stack with a side of lingonberries. Chocolate chip ones are also great, not too sweet (hold the cream and butter). Also have gotten the chicken crepes--they are good, though not as good as the pancakes. Staff is nice, service is pretty quick, as they get petty busy. Great for big parties. They get pretty crowded on weekends so be patient."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this trip here. The service was super slow and the food was average."}
{"text":"Every time we come to Vegas we have breakfast here. It's a great place. They have huge oven baked omelette's and a great selection of pancakes!! Waffles are amazing. All delicious. Reasonable prices, friendly staff and clean.   The only thing is that it gets busy so expect a wait on the weekend and holidays. Don't come if your starving cause your gonna get Hangry! Lol"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to have breakfast quickly before an event we had to be at. Midnight Diner was our original choice, however, we couldn't wait in their line because we were pressed for time. So we stopped in Original Pancake House. We were seated with 10 minutes by the hostess who called our name over the speaker. We heard it standing outside in front. We were seated and our waitress was there to take our order as soon as we sat down. We asked for a few more minutes, and after looking at the heavy looking pancakes at the table next to us, we knew we would go with waffles instead. We ordered the bacon plate, our food came out quickly and man that bacon is stuff dreams are made of!! It is sooooooo goood!! Nice and thick and cooked to a nice crisp. The Waffles however, tasted just like the pancakes looked, heavy. The batter just wasn't good at all. If I ever returned, it'd be for the bacon."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, all the chips are in, THIS IS THE BEST BREAKFAST IN VEGAS.  I know they are a chain, but for some reason, their other state counterparts just aren't the same. Out of the way if you are staying on the Strip or in Downtown, but worth the drive.  There's also one in Henderson in the Green Valley Ranch Casino that I go to and some other locations throughout Vegas.  Take the short trip, you won't regret it. Perfect for that after-party binge, helps you get over that hangover.  Everything I've had there is good, but I highly recommend 2 things: YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH THEIR SWEDISH PANCAKES WITH LINGONBERRY SAUCE.  If you want something sweet, FLUFFY and straight up delicious then get this.  You may want to get a side of breakfast meat to balance out the tastes. OR I go with the FRESH VEGETARIAN OMELETTE WITH THE 3 PANCAKES & A SIDE OF LINGONBERRY SAUCE.  Im not really a vegetarian type of guy (you can probably tell, if you've read the other reviews I've done), but this omelette is so light, fluffy and the veggies are so fresh that YOU WILL NOT REGRET EATING \"HEALTHY\"."}
{"text":"I am EXTEREMELY picky about breakfast food, so much so that I never eat it. But wow, the pancakes here are amazing. I don't know what it is about it but wow. The service is good too, always really friendly. I now know why my grandparents go here every single day for coffee :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times, since I usually stay at the Motel 6 when in Phoenix.  However the last time will be my last time.  I watched a cockroach crawl across the kitchen floor.  On the up side, the food was pretty good (pancakes, bacon, and scrambled eggs - orange juice from a carton).  I do have a strong stomach."}
{"text":"It's what you expect it to be. Consistently quick service and consistent quality of food. Amazing variety of pancakes -- and they're incredibly flexible on substitutions on combos (you can sub toast for most varieties of pancakes) which is awesome because their 49er pancakes are some of my favorites ever."}
{"text":"This place is worth the wait!  There always seems to be a wait when we arrive, yet it never really seems to be that long.   The service is always great, they have good hearty food, and strong coffee!  My hardest dilemma with breakfast is that I always want to try everything! Guess that means I need to continue coming back!"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad, but for a place that has \"pancake\" in it's name, I guess I expected more of their.. .well, pancakes.  It's clean inside and the service is pleasant.  They have a good menu with many options, baked pancakes, gourmet pancakes, waffles, omelets etc.  I had eggs, hash browns and pancakes.  The eggs were fine, the hash browns were country style and the pancakes looked fluffy, but they ate dense and slightly chewy.  The syrup was very sugary, too much so, that it had that no-sugar added kind of taste, where they overcompensate with sweetness.  I miss real maple taste.  I just wasn't a huge fan of the place, but it's not bad and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Omelets to die for  Found this place while searching for diner dive and dive places on the web. Not sure if it was featured, but the reviews were good. Prices are excellent and the food is amazing. Before we even got our food the OJ was the best I ever had, For breakfast I had the Santa Fe Omelet with 3 pancakes, OMG! Best omelet ever. The other orders were the western omelet and the Dutch Baby. All generous portions and delicious. This was a nice diversion from breakfast on the strip while in Vegas. Will surely be telling others about this place."}
{"text":"It's good, but not as good as their locations in California. In California they are amazing . The wait times are a little crazy. Good food at good prices."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spots I've ever been to. Was in charlotte for the night and needed a good meal before hitting the road and stumbled upon this gem thanks to yelp. When we arrived we were told the wait was 25-30 minutes which I didn't think was too bad for a Sunday morning especially with plenary of space outside to sit and wait, name was called in less than 15 minutes!!!! The service was amazing and very attentive. My girl was craving eggs Benedict and all the reviews said it was the best..... and they were one hundred percent right!!! They even brought out extra hollandaise sauce and hash browns for us and didn't even charge us for it!!!! I got the steak and eggs which is my go to breakfast and they nailed it!!!!!! perfectly seasoned and cooked steak!!! And to make the meal even better where most places give you toast with your meal I got three fluffy buttermilk pancakes. Needless to say I highly recommend this restaurant and would most definitely go back if I'm ever in the area. Oh and you gotta get the orange juice it's fresh squeezed and super tasty."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the Original Pancake House since I lived in Hawaii. That was years ago and I can't remember whether I liked it or not. We recently came here on a Saturday morning. The first thing I thought when we drove in was \"maybe this was a bad idea.\" The parking lot was packed! There were even cars parked on the street. Seriously, is this place THAT good? We walked in and there were many people waiting to get a table. We put our name on the list and they told us the wait would be 15 minutes. Surprisingly, they were right and did a good job cleaning up the tables and getting people seated quickly.  Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with the food. However, there are 3 good things about this place:  1. The bacon!! Cut thick and cooked very crispy, just the way I like it! Good bacon is important.  2. The coffee. I don't know what it is, but their coffee was great. I prefer a good amount of sugar and some cream, but I did not have to add much of both, and it didn't taste bitter.  3. The sugar. I love the dispensers they use because it makes pouring the sugar very easy, compared to the usual small packets that need to be torn open and can get messy.   Warning: this place loves onions!  First, I wanted to order the corned beef hash. I asked our waitress if I could get it without the onions, but she said no because it was premixed. So I just went with the short stack of bacon pancakes. They were a bit dry and the syrup was too watery. Isn't syrup supposed to be on the thicker side? Maybe they were being cheap and diluted it to save money. Ewww. I also ordered the potatoes with cheese as a side, and they had onions in them. Big pieces too! *sigh* My husband ordered the bacon and eggs. I got to try one strip of his bacon, and again, it was so good! Thick, crispy and tasty! In comparison to the thin and floppy ones at other places. Try it, and you will agree that they do bacon right!   Service was okay for being extremely busy. Honestly, I don't see myself returning, but if I do, I'll just order a coffee and a side of bacon!"}
{"text":"Every once in a while you'll stumble across a good gem. A gem so amazing that the food will haunt your stomach even weeks after you leave N.C. This is that gem. My strawberry pancakes were beyond ~*amazing*~ and I seriously ate everything on my plate. All 192252618 calories of it. Service was also amazing. If I ever get back down there, I will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here today, and I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the Pumpkin Pecan Pancakes with the homemade whip cream and an egg over easy on the side. The pancakes were nice and fluffy, and the whip cream was absolutely delicious! My husband had the OPH Grilled Chicken Salad, and he really enjoyed it. It was not crowded at all, but I think it was because we got there at 4pm. I highly recommend the OPH...In the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger \"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"This is the BEST breakfast place in Madison, nay, the world. Try the 49'er pancakes and you'll never go back to regular ones.   My family eats there every weekend!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. The Apple pancake is to die for and the Benedict was great! Def coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"I usually prefer local restaurants over chains, but this one FEELS local.  The food and service is consistently good and the huge variety of pancakes is impressive."}
{"text":"Nothing brightens my mornings faster than a short stack of  sweet and delicious pancakes!  This morning a few friends of mine talked me into trying out the Original Pancake House off of Charlottetowne Ave. We arrived at the restaurant at about 11:30 am, and it goes without saying that this place was packed. To my pleasant surprise we were seated within about 10 minutes. That was record time considering there were about 8 other parties in front of us.   Once seated we were greeted by our amiable waitress, and put in our orders. My champion breakfast that morning was the CIAA Combo #1, which consisted of two eggs scrambled with cheese, 5 strips of bacon, and 3 pancakes with a glass of apple juice to wash it all down. The food was delicious, it reminded me of my mother's homemade breakfasts. The pancakes were fluffy and moist, with just the right hint of sweetness in the  batter that you didn't even have to use alot of syrup. The eggs were scrumptious with a near perfect consistency and had a wonderful egg to cheese ratio. The only issue I could find with my breakfast was my bacon. As always, I ordered the turkey bacon, however, I neglected to ask for it to be cooked to the crisp. So when the waitress noticed this she kindly took back my bacon and brought me out a some fresh crisp strips. Such a kind staff, and very attentive. Overall, my dinning experience was memorable and pleasant, and my wallet thanked me. (My total for breakfast was only $8.97)   Outside of the restaurant are lots of shops and things within walking distance so feel free to shop around and work off some of that delicious meal you just indulged in. I sure did. Parking at the Original Pancake house is a little tight, but traffic in and out of the restaurant tends to move pretty quickly, so no worries.  I suggest you and your friends give the Original Pancake House a try, it's definitely a nice change of pace from the typical breakfast chains."}
{"text":"Fine for what it is.  Greasy breakfast food.  We used a groupon 12 for 20.00.  I'm glad we did because the food is pricey.  We shared the apple pancake, really sweet and eggy, but that is just the type of pancake it is.  We also had an order of crispy bacon and a side of eggs.  That's it, we shared everything.  We had to pay another 1.54 cents for tax and we left a tip.  Reasonable for what we had, overpriced if we didn't have the groupon."}
{"text":"Definitely a varied menu with many choices, but each option only differs slightly from the next and a lengthy menu equals quality by no means. Pancakes to me are a breakfast treat, a couple times a month indulgence. And so when I eat one, I want it to be really, really good. These guys just don't equate to more than some en mass batter topped with a few varied ingredients. Maybe next time I'll opt for one of the house specialties--definitely look good in the picture--look like more than your average pancake."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast.  If you enjoy fluffy buttermilk pancakes or gigantic fresh, hot eggs made any style, French toast or pretty much any breakfast food, the Original Pancake House will not disappoint you.  The pancakes melt your individual cup of whipped butter, syrup piles on it, fresh fruit (not canned or frozen, but sliced fresh berries) will cover them with whipped cream if you'd like.  Omelettes are made of four eggs.  Four.  I date you to eat and leave hungry.  The food is worth the rest.    Wait:  the place is only open until 1:30/2 on weekends.  There is not enough seating for the demand, so you will wait.  They have an efficient system and if you want to make your wait slightly shorter you can opt to sit at the counter.  However, after doing this, I would rather wait for a table.  I sat in a fixed stool next to a young woman flipping her hair as she took selfies and video chatted with someone.  I'm not a fan of other people's hair brushing my arm when I'm eating...so unless you are more comfortable with strangers or you don't mind the awful view of a dingy yellow(ish) wall, the uneven weirdly placed floor tiles that ripple up in the middle making me wonder how the employees are so coordinated that no one trips over that spot, please feel free to sit at the counter and view the tops of the cooks heads.  I would rather sit in the entryway and enjoy the bird photographs that are for sale while I wait.  Service is good.  My coffee only went empty once, as did the water cup we didn't even have to ask for.  Our server was friendly and efficient as well.    But if you have AT&T you may be like me and stuck with \"no service\" on your cellphone making the sign strategically placed reminding you to review them on Yelp sadly tantalizing.  There's no wifi unless you know the password to \"No Soup for You.\"  You will be stuck talking to your company or bring a book.  Luckily the food also comes fast so you can then concentrate on eating instead of rearranging tiles or trying to think what would look better on that wall (anything!!!)."}
{"text":"Meh, maybe if I was a  big breakfast lover. For me Bkfst is Bkfst-- lol. This place is an experience though. Total dive. The place is like from the 50's with the colors and tackiness of the decor. But hey that's what the three stars are for. I love diners being raised in Long Island. I really miss them. I have eaten here twice and both times something was wrong with the order, cleanliness, and/or service was very lacking. Very slow, very crowded, and the food is just not that great to keep me coming back. They are also a cash only establishment which is highly inconvenient for me. I have to admit their menu is extensive and the Dutch Baby, awesomeness of that German Pancake was to die for. The other stuff is just regular Breakfast food, and nothing special at that. The first time I went I did not like their pancakes. They was dry and not that great. I am glad I got the Dutch Baby this time around. That thing was darn good!!!!! I just don't eat pancakes enough to make it worth coming back that often."}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience here.   I had been dying to try the apple pancake that I had heard many good things about, so I headed to the Original Pancake House. The service was terrible. The server practically forgot my table existed. I had to wait a long time for anyone to even approach the table. When she finally did, I ordered a coffee and the apple pancake. My coffee came out and EW, there was lipstick on the cup. Unfortunately I didn't notice until the waitress had already wandered away from the table and when I was finally able to get her attention again, it took her far too long to return with a fresh cup.   When my pancake arrived, it was enormous. I looked down to get my fork in preparation of my first bite of apple-y goodness and was appalled to find my fork was dirty. I again had to try to get my waitress' attention to replace my fork, which again took forever.  Finally, I'm ready to eat. The flavor was nothing spectacular and I became bored about three bites in.   I really don't have too many positive things to say about this place and can't say I'm particularly motivated to try it again after this negative breakfast experience."}
{"text":"\"Original\"  Take that literally, as in unique, one of a kind.  I love breakfast.  I eat breakfast for dinner sometimes I like it so much.  I can honestly say that I have never been anywhere with so many original pancake recipes.  Fantastic.  Get \"the Apple Thing\".  Trust me.  This is a local institution.  Good early.  Bring cash."}
{"text":"I had to give you a review. This breakfast restaurant is out of the ordinary, the food was delicious, but the service was out of this world, everybody who works there makes you feel like you went back 20 years when service was important, very friendly, everybody smiling and Attentive. Highly recommended One suggestion is that they should make serving water an option. Visiting from California where water is an option at restaurants to see the waste of water there shook me"}
{"text":"OHOP has been around since the 1950's. Most customers will reflect this fact. Is the Dutch Baby worth the wait? If you like things like calzones or empanadas, maybe.   I've had the omelettes and pancakes. Don't be like me and get banana pancakes, which was a whopping ~$9 bucks for literally sliced bananas on pancakes. Nothing too special there. To get the best bang out of your buck, get an omelette instead-- it will come with an addition of eggs, meat, and potato for a slightly higher price, AND pancakes or toast. You can substitute the plain pancakes with, let's say, banana pancakes for an additional cost. I like a big breakfast. If you order the right way at OHOP, we can make it happen for you too."}
{"text":"It's a good thing that the line is long on weekend mornings because if it wasn't, I believe I would eat here every day. Their menu is large and includes all your favorites, but the inclusion of pancakes with every meal makes it an absolute delight. I often find myself scouring through breakfast menus to find an option that includes both eggs and pancakes but at this place, there is no searching necessary since all eggs come with pancakes !"}
{"text":"We love this place.  Dutch Babies are awesome.  We also love the crepes, the coffee, the servers!  Strawberry crepes are only available when fresh strawberries are in season.  What a concept!"}
{"text":"Original pancake house is a great gathering place with your friends! I've been here a handful of times and really enjoy the menu options. I recently went on a gluten free journey and it was impressive to find that Original Pancake House supported that with a gluten free menu. That said, their GF pancakes are satisfying and delicious!! The only thing is that it's always such a crowded atmosphere and the wait can be ridiculous so make sure you go in hungry but not too hungry because then you'll be hangry!"}
{"text":"Went on Christmas Eve for brunch. Very busy but the professional staff is obviously experienced at keeping the crowd happy.  I ordered an omelet with spinach & gouda cheese and also the Continental crepes. Omelet was very good, spinach was plentiful and fresh. The cheese was kind of concentrated into one area, could have been spread a little better. The crepes were very good with the tropical syrup, but I had to add the syrup because I only got the tiniest hint of triple sec in the filling. Of course you don't want to overwhelm the dish with triple sec but I only tasted about three drops. The fresh squeezed grapefruit juice was good and quite pulpy, but $5 is a bit pricey. The pancakes that came with the omelet were just pancakes; well made, but just pancakes. My daughter ordered a corned beef hash with braised (?) eggs on top and, I believe, a Nutella crepe. The hash dish was very good. She did not like the crepe, it was too wet. Side note: There was a lady walking through the restaurant making balloon animals for the kids. No idea if this is a regular thing, but it was cool."}
{"text":"Just ate one of their signature Dutch Babies. (Takes about 40 minutes.) Delicious. Plenty of powdered sugar, butter and lemon made it all the moreso. The side of bacon was a little overdone but still OK. My coffee cup was never empty so I'm pretty happy."}
