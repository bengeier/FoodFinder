{"text":"Went for tacos and a burrito late Sunday morning. The place looked a little sketchy but the parking lot was packed so we decided to give it a try. I ordered pork tacos which came with a super hot grilled pepper and radishes, limes and red sauce. My husband got a beef burrito. Both we super tasty, super fresh and big portions. Service was friendly. Plan to return the and try some of the shrimp plates."}
{"text":"We were encouraged by others to come here and were not disappointed. I had the more than generous California Burrito and my wife had various tacos all if which were good."}
{"text":"We have tried every restaurant and food truck serving Mexican food in Buckeye and surrounding neighborhoods, and Jacky's is by far our favorite. The street tacos are great, our favorites are Asada, Pastor, Pollo, Lengua, Camaron. Flour quesadillas with Asada are also great as are their Tortas. Actually, I haven't had anything there that I wouldn't want again."}
{"text":"Middle of nowhere, the father-in-law drove in and wanted to drive right out again, but he raves about it now after sticking with it. Best veggie burritos, amazing salsa. Service is great, and I'm impressed with their use of space. Definitely coming back, with friends!"}
{"text":"I'm from LA but whenever I come to AZ I have to stop at Jacky's multiple times! The food is always great! Haven't been dissapointed yet!"}
{"text":"so worth the time and effort it takes to find them - best tacos around!"}
{"text":"Best food truck around!  Hidden away so most people don't know where it is.  Let's keep it that way!"}
{"text":"Awesome street tacos. Friendly service. Will be a frequent stop. Hard to find if you weren't looking though."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect since this was not a traditional restaurant with a building.   I called in a an order to go.  Within 10 minutes, I had picked up a bacon breakfast burrito and brought it home.  It included a couple containers of salsa. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"Found a yum Mexican food truck in the a west valley! Fresh strawberry saying and lots of options. We did take out but you can stay there and eat too! We had several of the street tacos. My husband had a burrito. We ordered a side of beans and a side of guacamole. All yummy!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time... TERRIBLE. I had a gordita.. no flavor. My boyfriend had a carne asada burrito without beans and this was the cheapest, nastiest meat ever. We asked if we could exchange it for something different and we would pay the difference.. they said NO we had to pay full price just because we had the burrito \"how we wanted it\" which we only asked for no beans because he doesnt like beans. Honestly i wish I could've taken a picture of the meat because that was the grossest carne asada. If you want good mexican food go to LA FIESTA in Avondale its very good and affordable!! Im glad i tried this place anyways to know i will never come back!!"}
{"text":"My fiancés co-worker recommended this place, knowing we love real authentic Mexican food. This is the absolute best place I have eaten by far. Not only is the food beyond incredible, but the establishment is very clean, and the customer service is exquisite! The employees make you feel right at home. My fiancé had gotten the Mexican Californian burrito, and I had gotten the fully loaded Pastor burrito, grilled shrimp burrito, and shared a delicious cheese quesadilla. Everything is made and chopped fresh when ordered. Also the prices are amazing, my burrito was only six dollars and I still had half a burrito to take home to eat. I absolutely love and adore this family owned establishment!"}
{"text":"Im not sure why I didn't know about this place. It is amazingly good. Everything is made fresh and super delicious. I tried carne asada nachos, very good and perfect portions in topping; corn tortilla chicken quesadilla which was fried to perfection , crunchy & flavorful; carne asada tacos & chicken gordita was also great. Very fast & friendly service, great prices. Will be definitely going back"}
{"text":"Cheap Carne Asada. I ordered a carne Asada burrito because a friend recommended it to me, never again! I took one bite and spit it out on a napkin. I asked the server if I could switch it out for something different and I would pay the difference, because it tasted nothing like Carne Asada but she told me that they would not switch it because that's what I ordered and I would have to pay for a new meal. The lack of customer service is what also got me just because when you try a new place there's always something you may or may not like, as I tried giving it a second chance.... they refused to be reasonable. Will never come back."}
{"text":"Good street taco's. I had asada and shrimp. Mine were good but my wife's pastor tacos were very dry. The chicken quesadilla my wife had was outstanding.  We'll be back for tacos."}
{"text":"One word ... DELICIOUS! I ha shears about this place but I didn't realize it was a permanent structure so I wasn't sure where to find it. But, man this food is REALLY REALLY GOOD!  It's close to my house also. This is for sure my new go to Mexican spot . This place is so LA. My husband and I both had street tacos. Carne asada, shrimp , and pastor. BOMB!  Highly recommending it to all of my local friends. We will be back. Good service also."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the West Valley hands down better than any of the sitdown restaurants in the area I would recommend to anyone who loves Mexican food"}
{"text":"Love their food.  We don't have a lot of options way out here so it's nice to have something close that tastes good."}
{"text":"Omg Jackie's is the best. Food is fantastic every time. I've tried almost everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I got a steak breakfast burrito and The steak corn quesadilla. Burrito was good but the quesadilla was way better."}
{"text":"Looking for place to eat on the way back from Joshua Tree to Phoenix. Found this on Yelp and decided to give it a try based off all the good reviews. It is a very interesting place for sure. The food truck tent is literally located in the mid of no where. However, the food is awesome. Two of us ordered 4 people portion food. We got a couple of tacos, 1 enchilada, 1 gorditas, and 1 huaraches. I really wanted to try menudo, but that's only on the weekends. The waitress is super sweet. She couldn't believe we would eat all of the food. But we did because they were all really good. If you are like us enjoying to explore, please don't hesitate to give it a try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of about 10 people, and yes, we're all Mexican. We all enjoyed our food! We got mulitas, burritos, soft tacos, and shrimp cocktail. Everyone really enjoyed their food! Will be back soon! Great mexican food !"}
{"text":"At first I wasn't expecting much from the taco truck in the middle of nowhere. But it was the best reviewed taco closest to Buckeye. I had two tacos de asada, two de al pastor, and one asada gordita. The Asada was tasty but the pastor stole the scene. It was very flavorful. My favorite thing was the Gordita, it was crisp, not soggy, and had plenty of veggies. The masa was delicious and not bland."}
{"text":"This was a find for non-chain restaurant food in the area. Jacky's is a permanent \"taco wagon\" with authentic Mexican food. The food (I had chile rellenos) was tasty and inexpensive. The service was polite and efficient. I will certainly stop here again on my way to Yuma or San Diego, although I would assume that the heat of the summer will render it strictly to take-out or post sunset dinning."}
{"text":"Dont be scared of its unassuming appearance when turning into the parking lot - this place is legit.  Fantastic fresh mexican food and drinks (try the various flavors of \"Mexican water\"), with very friendly service.  Prices are reasonable as well.  Well worth the stop for a quick lunch or dinner.   We all very much enjoyed the food and experience.  Thank you Jacky's!"}
{"text":"Definitely our favorite go to for street tacos!  Love bring out of town family here to try something that they can't get back home!!"}
{"text":"You gotta try this!   Authentic Mexican.   Good and service was on Point!   Chilaquiles were Fire .   The Menudo was homemade and delicious.   In a really hidden spot."}
{"text":"Amazing! The food is delicious, great prices and great customer service. If you're looking for authentic Mexican food on the west side, Jacky's is your spot."}
{"text":"Great find and excellent food!  I judged them on their freshly made menudo and they didn't dissappoint.  Well worth the 5 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great price. I have gotten the asada gordita and it is amazing. Salsa is good and they give you all the fixins with your tacos as well. Way better than going in to dine"}
{"text":"Seriously the best Mexican food in metro phoenix...ever! This is a \"food truck\" on a dirt lot, seriously.  Its north of the i10 off Jackrabbit Trail.  If you are adventurous and you should be for food... you gotta try this place!  There's sit down tables, we do take out mostly, eat here often.  Weekends often there's 20 cars in the parking lot.  Great service, amazing food, great prices and value for huge portions.  Did I mention its best Mexican food ever?  Dont go south to Mexico for food, go to Jacky's!  By the way, dont confuse the Salsitas food truck that's just south on Jackrabbit, dont go there..."}
{"text":"Great food. The place is clean and super friendly staff. Definitely coming back with the fam and friends that visit from out of town. Affordable prices. We'd recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"For the love of tacos! My pops told me about this place that's just off the beaten path and boy have I found my go to for Mexican food locally. From the burritos to the tacos you won't be disappointed. Don't let the simple outdoor setup stop you from having a quality Mexican meal!"}
{"text":"Wow...best food truck food ever. Burritos are not only huge but also delicious. Seems to Always be a crowd but well worth the wait. Go hungry but definitely go. You will Not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Jacky's is located in a food truck on McDowell in no mans land between Perryville and Jackrabbit   We drive up a short dusty road and found a busy establishment. The setup made me wonder just a little bit, however, the number of cars in the parking lot gave a sense of reassurance.  Hubby ordered his standard variety of tacos (beef head is a favorite) and I ordered nachos with chicken.  Our food arrived quickly and it was tasty. Hubby cleaned his plate which is a rare occurrence. The nachos were enough for at least two people. I like nachos but shy away from ordering them after several disappointments. There were no disappointments at Jacky's, every chip was crisp and the ingredients were very good.  Our tab came to $22 with tax and tip. I look forward to bringing my family here on our next visit."}
{"text":"Tacos were okay, I was expecting the Mexican flare. I was a bit disappointed when we ordered our food and it wasn't until I was done with my meal that our drinks arrived. Horchata and mango agua Fresca those were delish! Too bad by that point I was done with my meal, offered no salsas. The red one we got was part of the chips and salsa that's they give while you wait. I would say a 3 stars most definitely. I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Jacky's is simply amazing. The food is always top notch no matter what you order. I've tried almost everything on the menu and their food never disappoints. They also have outstanding customer service. The ladies are all extremely nice. The only downside is probably the location. But the food and service definitely makes up for it.   Only recommendation is that they maybe have some signs put up to let people know of the location. Must go if you're in the buckeye area or if you are passing by!"}
{"text":"Jacky's food is excellent. It is refreshing to have authentic Mexican food in the far West valley. There is a large selection of items. The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious. The tortillas are handmade! It is very popular , so you may need to have some patience, but it is well worth the wait. Try to avoid weekday lunch if you can as it tends to be very busy at that time."}
{"text":"Delicious and awesome breakfast burritos! Also works out great for our kiddo as he loves the availability of fresh fruit and the beans are killer. We have only been there for breakfast but will definitely be trying lunch in the future. For breakfast, I recommend the chorizo burrito. My brother also loves that real Coke is served and they are prompt with the service."}
{"text":"We stopped in mid-morning for a breakfast burrito.  The entire area was super clean and nicely decorated.  Plenty of shaded seating.  We ordered two burritos-(which were big enough for two meals!), and a street taco.  Not the best burrito I've ever had, but good.  Very good.  Chips and salsa are free it you eat in.  Lots of menu choices, portions are plentiful.  The service was fast and friendly.  They take Visa!  We feel like we found a hidden treasure."}
{"text":"This is the perfect example of a hole in the wall. Went with some friends, good food and very reasonable. The ladies that took our order and waited on us were very nice. Had the carne asada burrito and recommend it if you go. If you like taco truck style food this is the place."}
{"text":"Great place when the actually put what u ask on the food. I've resorted to just getting street tacos so that they don't mess up my food.  Other than that they are always nice when we go there. My son and his friends love this place."}
{"text":"Great road side spot for some really good Mexican food! Easy to find and you can cool off in the shade. They have a good variety on their menu. One of the best road side restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"Family trip from San Diego, CA to AZ to visit friends and found out the Mexican food here is supposed to be just as good if not better than in San Diego. We have tons of taco shops so I've had my fair share of good and bad food. This place is legit! I loved everything we ordered. Cali burrito, nachos with chicken, street tacos asada and chicken. All were amazing! We will definitely be back every time we come."}
{"text":"First and only time here and I was hooked. We were looking for local, authentic Mexican joint and found the positive reviews here on Yelp. We were so happy to have made the 20 minute drive. Food was on point and the service was super nice. The only warning I can give is that it is not in a standing, structures building, basically its a couple of food trucks skillfully tented to hold the Arizona sun at bay - there are tables and chairs, quite comfortable for all its rustic-ness."}
{"text":"Jacky's Mexican Restaurant, 19005 W. McDowell in Buckeye, AZ made OUTSTANDING meals for our neighborhood Cinco de Mayo Party  attended by 160 people. We had so much extra food, we were able to donate the remainder to Buckeye Fire Station #703-Verrado on N. Verrado Way. Party goers were treated to four street tacos per person, with choices of beef, pork & chicken; beans & rice, salsa, onions, peppers, radishes & cucumbers. The price per person was very reasonable.  The food was all ready to go when we arrived with two pick up trucks. In six minutes, the staff @ Jacky's had all the food in the trucks & we were on our way.   I will definitely use them again!!!"}
{"text":"Jacky's is a really good Mexican food place and their salsa and chips are on point. Also the horchata and their agua de piña are so good. My husband and I enjoy going to eat here every now and then."}
{"text":"Love is place! Have been a customer of theirs since the beginning! The food is great and very tasty! I haven't found anything I don't like on their menu and the staff is very friendly. It's a cool food stand that I recommend to anyone! Their breakfast burritos are hot and huge!"}
{"text":"I recently discovered jackys within the last 2 months, i've been going there at least three times a week since then. At first everything was amazing, the food and customer service and since i've been going there more often they've become so rude. they \"forget\" the limes and then when i ask for them they get an attitude and then try to charge me for them. the quality of the food gets worse every time i come. today at least 1/4 of my burrito was drenched in oil and it was running down my hands. i don't understand what i did to be treated this was at my favorite taco spot... needless to say i won't return, because my business is obviously not welcomed. in my opinion, salsitas on jackrabbit is about the same."}
{"text":"Great place to stop by if you're on your way in or out of California and if you're a local then you're in luck. The order and time of wait for food was quick and accurate. Thumbs up all the way!"}
{"text":"I order a shrimp burrito every week and they are always good. I came today and it's got an abundance of sour cream and was half the size as usual. I asked the lady to fix the burrito and was met with attitude, very disappointed. Usually this place is great."}
{"text":"There were three of us and all three ordered  Huaraches there were awesome. We ordered  Pastor,Asada and Shredded beef. We all agree there were awesome. the service was the best. we'll be back. (Authentic)"}
{"text":"Excited to have found this place!! It is a hidden gem making some bomb food! The gorditas and chilaquiles are really good but the carne asada is average. I can only imagine how busy they would get if they had a better location.   If the owners are reading this, I highly suggest putting up a sign that is visible from the highway. I drive past there everyday and didn't have a clue that it has been there for 3 years. I wish I would have found this place much sooner.  #LatinoApproved"}
{"text":"After hearing so many friends recommend this place, we decided to give it a go. The nachos were huge and delicious, but everything else was a little dry.  I don't think the food is worth sitting under a tent in a folding chair."}
{"text":"The food was alright. It seems that the prices keep going up every time I order to go. I dislike that they dont provide a receipt with the actual charges. They only provide you with a total amount. My bill was almost $30 for 2 burritos, and 2 quesadillas. Seemed pricey to me for the value. My children were disappointed."}
{"text":"I'll bet you've driven by this place a hundred times and thought it sure doesn't look like much but they always seem busy! Well, you'd be correct on both counts. The food is delicious! The homemade quesadilla is the best! Most folks order and take their food home but if you don't mind simple unpretentious open air ambiance, have a seat, wave off the flies and enjoy your meal.  I'd rather take mine home but in a pinch we'll eat there and enjoy La Musica!  Reasonably priced and authentically Mexican, Jackys is worth the stop! But don't blink! You don't want to miss it!"}
{"text":"Definitely agree with other reviewers. The place isn't much to look at and it's in the middle of nowhere but the food is bomb and the staff was very nice. I recommend."}
{"text":"We love to stop by the taco stands when visiting Rocky Point.  Little did we know we could have the same experience at home. Jacky's rocks!  The food is delicious, fresh and fairly priced.  Their menu is a step up from those in Mexico, serving everything from menudo to huge breakfast burritos to talapia dinners.  Lots of room to eat in or you can order to go.  Stop by, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Best Mexican spot I've ate at in Arizona the California burrito is delicious the nachos & tacos are so good"}
{"text":"I ordered a shrimp burrito with guacamole and cheese. They forgot the cheese and guacamole, which really isn't a big deal, I understand these things happen.  However, the shrimp were not even deveined, not a single shrimp. It was absolutely disgusting. Two shrimp had tails left on them, kind of important to remove the tails when it's in a burrito. Thankfully I was already removing the shrimp because they weren't deveined and avoided eating the tails.   It's really too bad because the flavors are great, but I question the quality of their food and cleanliness if they can't even bother to devein the shrimp. What else are they cutting corners on?"}
{"text":"Great food and service super friendly. Here is an updated menu from what is posted here"}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food. The wait was short and the portions were generous. I had nachos with no meat and no dairy my husband had cali burrito with everything. The Mexican sodas are delicious."}
{"text":"I truly wish that this place had better food. Somethings they do are fine, the refried beans are yummy and one of their hot sauces is ok but it's the one they serve with chips and salsa. The one they serve with an entrée is really not that appetizing. I'm not sure why they don't make their own chips and they buy the round ones you can get in bulk from Costco or Sam's Club. We live right down the road from this place and would love it if the food was just better. We've gone there to grab lunch on days were working in the yard but every time we're just slightly disappointed in the food. I wish they would eat what they're serving and design it to have better flavor. We will continue to keep trying different times maybe they'll step up their flavor game."}
{"text":"Best quesadillas I have ever had! Handmade corn tortillas, and just the right amount of cheese, not a greasy mess! I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"this family doesn't BS with the food. Everything made from scratch and done to perfection. We had the carne asada burrito and some taco with a hand made corn tortilla it was ridiculously good and fresh with 2 fresh salsas that were that were crazy good as well. This place will be on my weekly calendar for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick meal before heading back to Cali. Found them on yelp.  Eating area was very clean. Tables were clean & utensils & napkins, salt were already at the table, Nice.  I don't judge a homely pop up tent because we live in LA & that's not uncommon for taco pop up spots for us.  They had a sink with soap and water available as well as outdoor heaters and fans for changing weather. & a tv to watch while eating there.  Most importantly... everything was clean!We ordered carne asada tacos, asada tortas & a asada huarache (there was 5 of us).  The food was good. The tortas & huarache was a good size portion and inexpensive for a little over $6 each.  Tacos were about $2 each.  They brought us chips & homemade salsa (red Chile) while we waited for our food which was a nice bonus for a food truck. Our food was good & hot.  We were all pleased and will definitely stop by again next time we're in town. The lady who took our order & brought us out our food was friendly.   Only reason it doesn't get 5 starts, they indicated \"guacamole\" on a lot of their menu items and it's really a avocado thin/watery sauce, slightly spicy.  We had 3 items that were suppose to have guacamole on them but all 3 had that sauce instead.  Other than that, the food was good."}
{"text":"This place is not for me.  I like authentic Mexican food but my street tacos were bland and the meat tasted different to me.  Ordered 2 and tossed one.  Then went elsewhere for lunch.  They only gave us about 6 chips and hot sauce with meal."}
{"text":"Was not expecting this place in any sense, haha. I was surprised sitting in the car as we turned into the rocky parking lot and past the busted looking fence, I looked up and was like \"uuuuummm???\" All I saw was this broken down looking half tent half building and didn't know where we were until I saw the small sign that said Jacky's Mexican by the road. When we pulled up closer and I saw the food truck then I got excited.  Nothing is better then some street-style Mexican food! They have a lot of options, I only wish they had some Elote and Chile Rellenos also They also have a vegetarian menu. Initially they were a little confused when we wanted to order one of the items without meat and just with more veggies (they gave us a quesadilla with just cheese and lettuce) but it was cleared up and we got a veggie burrito packed with veggies and potatoes. One of the girls let us know that they have something for everyone there, whether you want something spicy or if you are vegan/vegetarian. My favorite however were the beans and rice are, not many \"Mexican restaurants\" can make them right but these were just like my Grandma makes them. I wanted more and can't wait to return, so don't let the outside appearance deter you and give it a shot!"}
