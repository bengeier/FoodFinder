{"text":"Food was tasty and high quality but was small portioned. We had ordered a tamasalata dip, lamp shank specially wrapped in parchment paper and a grilled octopus tentacle. Our server was very knowledgeable but she was the exception as the other staff were very uninformed about the food and provided little to no interest in recommendations otherwise. 

Atmosphere was good,  saw a few dates taking place but personally found to talk as the room itself amplified noise.

Part of what made this experience undesirable was because we were not given the option the even have tap water. We were pretty much forced to be charged for having still water. Additionally we were never informed that we'd be charged for asking for additionally pita when the 4 small pieces were insufficient for the dip we ordered."}
{"text":"Food here is satisfactory -staff are pleasant ... But be aware of surprisingly high costs when it comes to \"market-price\" items.  We were very unhappy to learn that our very simple grilled Beeliner fish cost a whopping $65!  Not happy that the waitress didn't mention this especially when all other food items from this section of the menu were in the $20 - $30 range.  Very deceiptful of her not to inform us of the price."}
{"text":"Guys you smell like your menu. No excuses. Tempted by the Greek menu and the nice decor.... Regretted our choice with the first course.... Beside the good wine and tender octopus, there is clearly a disconnect between what you project and the actual experience. We are still trying to air our jackets and disappointment"}
{"text":"YUMMY! I was here in February for a friend's birthday. She had organized a fixed sharing menu for the group - I highly recommend as the staff was very accommodating and attentive.

We had dips and super soft pita, spanakopita, octopus, tomato salad, lamb chops with tabouli and tzatziki, spicy potatoes and assorted ice cream and cookies for dessert.

I can't find a fault with the meal. The lamb chops were the star, I loved the smokey meat paired with creamy tzatziki and some acid from the tabouli. I could have eaten the platter. Spanakopita was also an impressive version, very flaky pastry and a savoury salty filling. 

The atmosphere was also really fun and lively, I'm going to go back this summer and pretend I'm in Greece."}
{"text":"Stopped by Mamakas on a friday night without a reservation, it was quite packed. We were second in line, but were seated very quickly at the kitchen.

Service was fast, friendly and knowledgeable. I found the menu hard to navigate as I was unfamiliar with a lot of the terminology but the server was great at explaining.
Sitting by the kitchen, we were also able to interact with the kitchen staff who were also friendly.
Food was delicious, on the higher end in terms of price but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Went with the family on Sunday night. 
The place was busy ,loved vibe. 
The food was excellent!!!!!!!
Fresh and tasty and the service was super friendly. 
We are coming back foshu."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Highly recommend this place. I loved the decor and selection of Greek wines. I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Go to this restaurant. Busy as hell. Great energy. Fabulous food. Fabulous. I would say this is the currently the best Greek in Toronto. Savoury, interesting flavours. Share everything. Don't expect extremely fast service as this place is crazy busy (in a good way) but have a drink (also great) and take it all in. My favourite dining experience of 2014. This resto nailed it."}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious! Came here with some family and it was a lovely intro to upscale dining. Totally laid back atmosphere, great vibe in the place (servers wear denim if that gives you an idea). Would go back!"}
{"text":"For starters, I would recommend the olives and the taramosalata/kopanisti house dips. Very different textures but great beginners. The grilled octopus was tender to perfection. We ordered the grilled Ontario lamb and I have had better so I wouldn't order it again. For dessert, try the baklava with honey + milk ice cream. We also ordered the olive oil ice cream but it crumbled (not smooth and creamy like gelato). It did taste better when we let the ice cream melt slightly. Aside from food, the service was impeccable, very friendly!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the atmosphere and the friendly host staff. Our waitress was helpful with the descriptions of the food as most of it was in Greek.

The food was decent, I enjoyed the dips and the traditional Greek salad. Both I would get again.

I went on a night they roasted a whole lamb so we opted for that, but the portions of meat they served were small and not satisfying.

However the Greek amber beer and the baklava rounded the meal off nicely."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant.  I've been here twice now,  once for work and once with my wife,  and both experiences were excellent. Staff is friendly,  service is quick,  and the food is great!

Im partial to the dips you get as appetizers.  I think I could subsists on  a few of those and their flatbread for a few weeks."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but seems like this past year their menu offerings/selection are way less than it used to be. They should add more variety. Was also disappointed with the portion of octopus for the price there should have been more than one piece of octopus! Service was good although our bottle of wine came after our appetizers were nearly all done. Overall I don't have this resto on my top fav anymore unfortunately."}
{"text":"Started off with their house dips Melitzanosalata and kopanisti which came with soft house made pita breads and the Patates (Greek fries). Amazing starter. For our second course we ordered cheese saganaki, Moussaka, Horiatiki and keftedes, the Presimmon was pre grilled to perfection, and the humus with parsley puree stole the show. Finally we completed our meal with brined chicken  let me tell you the lemon butter sauce is amazing. Cocktails karida was amazing. Ambiance is amazing friendly staff would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food was very average and it took a long time to prepare.  The hostess had a major attitude, and the server was quite clueless.  Overall, it isn't a good value for money place.  I will not return."}
{"text":"Came here on the first day of my Toronto visit. Bf is Greek so it was obvious choice. The place has a small cozy feel. 

Initial impression was great, since we were constantly asked if someone had helped us ( we were waiting for a table).  

We ordered the zucchini flowers, the lamb chops, and the grilled fish of the day. The zucchini flowers were ok but for for the price charged for cheese stuffed flowers(only 4 pieces) was a bit much. I would order again.
The lamb chops were delicious especially with the tzatziki and bulgar.  We have had plenty of different types of tzatziki at Greek places and this was our fave. The fish was decent, cooked well. Bf said he has had much more flavorful fish. 

Great experience until the waitress refused to separate the liquor and the food as two different checks. We had asked her about three times and she kept refusing. She didn't even ask the manager. So Bf ended up having to go up to another staff by the register and the staff immediately accepted the request without hesitation. We received our separate checks and placed the cards out to pay. The waitress took longer to process the cards in fact we had to point it out to her. 

Overall good dinner and Food is worth trying. Service can be better. Servers shouldn't take away plates so fast and shouldn't inconvenience customers."}
{"text":"Giving this place just two stars, for now, but I think it has the potential to be very good. 

Went as a group of 4. We were very excited to try it out as we had watched the construction for a long time. Was very busy but the atmosphere was great and the food smelled amazing. Sat at our table at the back and picked the cheap, $39, bottle of sauvignon blanc. Waiter told us he hated it and it was horrible. Suggested either a $50 or $80 bottle instead. Nice try. 

As for food, guess we didn't realize it was share plates but ordered some appetizers and a few mains. Server kept saying we needed more and that we had to have some salad that he never ended up bringing. Fish main was sold out and there was no other veggie non shellfish option. Appetizers were generally $12-$16 but were very small. Half an eggplant with some onion on top and a half slice of toast was like $16. Waiter told us we would have to pay for more bread, but graciously brought us another have slice even though he wasn't supposed to. What a rogue! Eggplant tasted good. Saganaki was very good. Mains were also excellent. Waiter was inattentive because he seemed preoccupied with a large group who would yield a bigger tip. With better service and more value, this place would be awesome. 

Tl;dr delicious food and good atmosphere hampered by poor service and mediocre value."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in Toronto. Focusing on seasonal ingredients, the chefs create inventive versions of classic Greek dishes like horitaki salad, saganaki, spanakopita. Lamb chops and sea bass were grilled to perfection. Enjoyed a really unusual but tasty ricotta cheesecake with rhubarb and sesame. Delicious! They also offer an extensive list of Greek wines. The service is excellent -- efficient and attentive. I have already made another reservation for a return visit next week. The place is busy, so reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"Food: What can I say this place is Amazing!!!

Service: Was number one, my glass was never empty.

Ordered: Spanakopita, Tzatziki Dip, Chicken, Pork sausage, I was completely full by the end of all that."}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place. Very nice atmosphere, good friendly unpretentious non-hipster service. Wine was good. Tzatziki was great. But it all went downhill after that. Eggplant dip was under spiced and overly date-y. Some pita was quite burnt so I requested (and was charged $5) for another one. Was told sea bass is almost always a special and very popular so I ordered it. Was later told at 6:15pm it was sold out. Had snapper instead - doused in oregano.

Greek restaurant with no potatoes (sorry cheese fries don't count) or rice?"}
{"text":"Un service parfait.
De la nourriture authentique.
Une ambiance agréable.
Les prix sont raisonnables.

Nous avons partagé :
- House dip (tzatziki avec pain grec)
- Spanakopita
- Asperges au citron
- salade grecque
- vin rouge grecque
- baklava
- café grec

Total incluant taxes et service = 150$

Portions plus que suffisantes.
Tous nos plats étaient savoureux.

Un sans faute."}
{"text":"We were curious to try it because of the gorgeous setting and the absolutely amazing romantic ambience.  The dips and spanakopita we had as apps were great, but the lamb arrived as chewy and not quite cooked properly-- quite rare inside and tough.  Well, you can't screw up lamb in a Greek resto so we decided there's no reason to go back-- too bad, because of the beautiful setting for our little date night."}
{"text":"I've had Mamakas on my list of \"go to\" restaurants for a while and it met all of my expectations! I went there with a girlfriend for dinner last night and the food was so delicious. As a half greek myself, and having been exposed to a lot of real Greek food in my life, this restaurant held its own quite well!

First off, our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. After we ordered he offered us a new menu item on the house to get our opinion (yes please!)

We ordered the keftedes (beef and mint meatballs) and Greek salad to start and the item on the house was the saganaki with apricot & honey. The keftedes were nice and light with the mint sauce and the Greek salad was very traditional without lettuce and lots of feta but the saganaki was by far our favorite. The saganaki is on the menu without the apricot but the sweet and salty pairing was absolutely amazing! Hopefully they add it to the menu soon so everyone else can try because it was to die for.

As a main course I had the fish of the day which was sea bream and my friend ordered the moussaka which is a Greek version of lasagna/Sheppard's pie. The fish was a whole fish, head and all, dressed with lots of lemon, oregano and olive oil (yum)! The moussaka had the same flavors as my Greek relatives make so I was very impressed. As recommended from our waiter, we also ordered a side of red peppers which were also sweet and delicious!

Overall, I would 100% go back! Food was amazing and authentic, service was friendly, atmosphere was lively - couldn't have asked for more!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this restaurant. Food was flawless, and service was great with our server making excellent recommendations. I felt my glass of wine was great value. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My 3 mates and I dined there a week ago. Service was very good, but unfortunately the food was not. I felt that the fish was not fresh. I attribute the food poisoning I experienced to the food ate at this restaurant"}
{"text":"I would give this place minus 5 stars if I could. I was walking by that place with a friend at around 1 pm when we saw a guy grilling a lamb outdoors. We were tempted to try it and the guy and his buddy told us to come after 3 pm to try it. When we came at 3:05 they closed the place in front of us. I was really surprised and asked their hostess how is it possible that they invite people to come at times when they're closed. She spoke to the \"lamb guy\" and invited us in (he was nice). Inside we were ambushed by a very arrogant manager who didn't even apologize for what happened. He was happy to tell us that they are closed and no more lamb left. \"Come after 5 pm for dinner serve\" he said. I'll be honest I was already reluctant to go, but in the end of the day you only live once. We came there at 5:30. The same manager didn't even say hi, though he clearly made contact with both of us on multiple occasions. The hostess offered us seats a the bar next to the smoky kitchen. As a side note she asked if we have reservations (we didn't but why couldn't she offer us to make reservation when we spoke to her earlier that day?!). It took 20 minutes and 3 reminders for waitress to arrive. During this time we had an opportunity to overlook some food burning on the grill, and their manager and chef badmouthing pedestrians. In the end of the day the waitress arrived and told us that we can't have this lamb as it will be ready only in a couple of hours. We left of course. This place truly sucks and I will never ever come there again. What a f***ing waste of time! I normally don't write reviews on Yelp, but I had to post it as it simply unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Had trouble booking a table for birthday , called in three times to make sure the reservation is made! 
On the day , when called in to confirm the booking was told that for big parties every person should order min $50. As it was not communicated at the time of booking the manager made an exception. That aside , the appetizers taste very good and the eggplant tahini ice cream tastes very unique."}
{"text":"3.5/5! Great ambiance, fantastic location and amazing apps! We recommend the eggplant and meatballs from the starters section. The cocktails are unique and the staff does an awesome job of pairing choices. The only downside was my main. We ordered the grilled shrimp and, personally, I thought it was overpriced for 5 pieces of shrimp (nothing special about the way it was made). If we go again, we would order the lamb and that might revising this rating."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the chefs bar with a good friend. As expected for a Saturday, the place was really bustling, line up at the door the whole night. The atmosphere is great, beautiful room, upbeat music and a well run kitchen banging out amazing food. It is family style dining so we had 5 or 6 dishes that were all a good size. By far the best was the grilled Octopus, it was actually the best I've ever had. It was cooked to perfection and paired wonderfully with peas. I can't wait to go back and try the lamb chops as they looked amazing! Service was attentive and pleasant. Will definitely go back and spread the good word."}
{"text":"The good is good, but don't go here if you're hungry. Portions are really small for what you pay. Even with a reservation, you'll get a reminder email, plus a phone call which really annoys me. Had a reso for 8:15, and we got seated next to a nice, white wall, while the table by the window was\"reserved\" for a couple arriving at 8:30. This kind of pretension doesn't sit well with me and I wouldn't return. I was out with a friend from Europe who also couldn't comprehend the cost-to-portion ratio. Lastly, it was noisy, very noisy."}
{"text":"Amazing Food, great ambience. 

However, the server was one of the most miserable, unfriendly people I have ever met."}
{"text":"I went here for my friend's birthday and I was impressed. Although the service was pretty poor, we sat at the chef's table and had a very reasonably priced delicious dinner. There was 6 of us and we had a 250 bill despite ordering 3 mains and 4 appetizers along with drinks. The haloumi and the goat tartar were to die for, though the spanakopitas was average. For mains we had the lamb chops, which were perfectly cooked along with the grilled octopus which was amazing. Although the service wasn't great the food was amazing, i'd for sure recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really wanted to enjoy this place. As many people have said here they heard great things and were excited to try this food. Our experience unfortunately fell short of what we expected.

Cured swordfish. 3.5/5: - ok flavour. Under seasoned. 

Cheese Saganaki. 1/5: Maybe we don't know Greek food, but this was was basic. You could get this at any bar. Its a bunch of cheese melted in a cast iron skillet with some figs and raw walnuts. A joke.

Lamb. 2/5: Anyone saying this is the best lamb in the city is a joke. It was overcooked and under seasoned. Cold when it arrived. We can not stress enough - this is not the best lamb in the city.

Octopus. 3/5: Slightly over cooked. Underwhelming dish in our opinion.

Greens. 3.5/5: Green beans that you can make at home. Made at Mamakas.

Cocktails. 5/5: Great drinks.

Can't stress enough that this place is over-rated and over-priced. Read the reviews and you will see consistently that the dishes above receive the same criticism - with the occasional fanboy raving about how the tzatziki is the best they ever had. So many better options."}
{"text":"Delicious food but on the pricy side. The tomato and feta salad was $18. It was good but not worth $18. The grilled octopus was the bargain of the night at $21. The staff was very friendly and helpful with the menu. The decor is casual and bright. I enjoyed the experience but probably wouldn't go back because of the prices."}
{"text":"Exceptionally satisfied after our meal at Mamakas Taverna. Nice addition to Ossington. The restaurant was full so we took a seat at the stools overlooking the kitchen - which I personally love because you get to watch the talented chefs do their thing. Everything that left that kitchen was presented perfectly and looked delicious. We ended up having the tzatziki, fried artichokes, grilled octopus with a fava puree, sauteed green beans and the roasted free-range chicken, glazed with honey and lemon thyme. We witnessed the chef carefully glaze the chicken several times and when we were presented with the dish, we were very pleased with the flavour and nice crisp of the skin. Must try the whole fish on my next visit. My only disappointment of the night was my cocktail - but hey, I was there for the food!

If you have the patience to wait in line, check out Bang Bang Ice Cream across the street."}
{"text":"A beautiful space with hit and miss food (sweetbreads were laughable with afterthought turnips, goat tartare quite lovely) but what a poor excuse for service. Sharing a multi-course meal where not once are you quality checked and course after course is dropped with no descriptor, dessert menu with nothing said, and bill with no acknowledgment. Unfortunate that that can pass for service, and that alone will keep me from returning, even for the out of this world tzatziki."}
{"text":"I didn't read any of the reviews here before visiting, but I wish I did. I agree with most of the comments here in that the atmosphere is unique and gives off a great ambiance, combine with the good service, it makes for an experience. However I should have realize why we are able to get a table for 2 immediately on a busy Friday night, when we cannot find a seat anywhere else on Ossington. (We have no reservations.)

The food is yummy, it seems like you can't go wrong with any of their options because when I had a look around, everyone is ordering something different and everyone seem to enjoy their food. However, the price is definitely NOT worth the overall food and experience. (Unless you really had money to burn...?) We ordered 2 appetizers, 1 main, and still water for 2 people. Plus tip, total came to nearly $80. A bit ridiculous if you ask me.

Toilets are also a bit shocking; tiny and dirty for such a pricey poshy place.

Overall...
Food: 4 stars
Price: 1 star
Service: (we tip for the service which is probably the only thing that deserve) 5 stars
Overall experience: 3 stars

Sadly, I would not step foot in this place again... I don't think I can afford to!"}
{"text":"Great Spot - Super Busy and Super loud , went in with a group of 10 .. we had a prix fix menu which was great as it gave us an opportunity to try a lot of the menu. The food was great loved the spanakoptia (sp) - Lamb chops were on point and Octopus was very good. The only area i saw this fail in was the service, I can respect the place is busy but waiting 15mins for a 2 cocktails was a bit much. ALso for one reason or another our waitress kept forgetting to clear our plates ? so as food kept coming she was struggling to find space to put our food down (we did sharing style) so eventually we just helped her along with piling all the plates together. The desserts were fantastic we had the ice cream and backlava (sp) - they were also very good.. would have given 5 stars if only i could find space to put my drink down LOL .. great resto you wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"A friend recently claimed Mamakas to be the best restaurant in Toronto right now. I am always skeptical of such claims, especially because I went to Alo for my last birthday. Decided to give this a go anyway and see what the hype is about!

We walked in and all the tables were reserved so we were offered a seat at the bar by the hostess, which I am totally ok with because you get to see the chefs working and that's always super fun. You get more of an insight on how things are prepared and how the kitchen is run.

The server was pretty friendly, and gave us a rundown of the menu and an idea of how much we should order. I asked a couple of questions about what we should get and she was helpful, except for one tiny, but annoying error - I will explain more shortly. 

What we got:
- tzatziki dip: this was delicious and addictive, with fresh dill. what the server forgot to mention was that the lamb we ordered also comes with this dip, so this was a double order. if we had known, we would have tried another app
- house made pita: we ordered these once and then ordered them again cause they were freaking amazing and also because of the repeat dip that came with the lamb. they grill these and then season them \"salt bae\" style before they are served. the salt comes as a nice burst of flavour and crunch with some bites
- fried smelts: YUM, addictive little salty bites of goodness, served with some kind of aioli 
- greek salad: the most authentic greek salad i've had outside of greece. came with a big slab of GOOD feta at the top
- the lamb main: grilled, with a nice char, but a little rare for my liking - although my husband loved this. came with more tzatziki, which annoyed me lol
- the octopus main: the way they prepare this is sous-vide and then grilled, which makes it perfect. it comes on a bed of santorini fava, which i found to be a bit grainy, could have been creamier. but i enjoyed this more than the lamb
- baklava + ice cream dessert: good baklava, good ice cream. not too sweet and a well balanced dessert
- aphrodite cocktail: good, cute cup, not too sweet 
- siko old fashioned cocktail: my husband enjoyed it

is this the best restaurant in toronto? no. is it worth a try and worth going back? absolutely, yes. the tea smoked chicken and whole fish (they debone it after it's grilled - i love a good whole, deboned fish!) are on my list of mains to try next time!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food+Sexist service? Methinks not.

I came here to chill on a Sunday night by myself and got seated at the inner bar. I asked about the menu on the chalk board because it's written in greek. The server didn't offer me the Daily Fish (Seabass) special. He claimed that he never offered it to anybody because of its $38 price. But he offered it to a single middle age man right beside me? Sexist much? I guess since I'm woman, I will never have enough money to buy a $38 fish. He also didn't offer me dessert. I guess since I'm a woman, I will never eat any sugary treats either (I found out that this place serves dessert later on when a friend pointed it out)

The 'Tiganites Patates - Handcut Potatoes+Kefalotyri+Garlic Sauce' is a $8 fries(good fries, but definitely not worth the price), not those Lemon Greek Potatoes that people has in mind. The menu is tricky. Make sure you have your 'Man' to ask the server if you're not sure. I inquire the server about this, but he just said, \"Oh yeah, I know what you're talking about. Nah, it's just fries.\" So, it seems that I'm not the first and only person who got ripped off by their tricky menu. I only ate 3 pieces of fries. There was no regret from the server even though I barely touched the plate. In other restaurants, when a server saw that the plate is barely touched, they would have taken it off the bill. But I guess, since I have no 'Man' with me, I don't deserve such treatment.

Just in case anyone is wondering. I ordered the $8Kopanisti, $16Goat Tartare, $16Halloumi, $15Roasted Cauliflower, $8Fries, $14Angostura Sour. With tips+tax, I ended up spending $100++ for this Sexist Service. This is my second time here, so hopefully this is just a one time thing. I will definitely bring a man next time though."}
{"text":"Beautiful and comfortable interior. Friendly staff. We ordered fried smelts with lemon for appetizer, tomato salad, grilled octopus and lamb chops for mains. The food was simple but delicious. Highly recommend the octopus and lamb chops!"}
{"text":"Beautiful room, grill is hot and food is quite nice.  Nice service
Touch pricey but kind of worth it
Upscale Greek"}
{"text":"We came in 10 minutes early for our reservation at 6:15pm and we were told by the hostess very rudely that we were too early. She told us to come back later. She could have just said that our table wasn't ready yet but she said it in a very ill-mannered way. We were so disgusted with her that we didn't even bother coming back and ended up dining somewhere else. Such a shame though since the restaurant looked nice."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, a great looking, casual... friendly space in a great neighbourhood, but the food, it always come down to the food.  

Before I begin, we were explained to that this is a family style dinner, much like you'd get in a Greek family home. Well, since I grew up around Greek families then it should be familiar and amazing! Looking at the menu, I noticed the prices to be quite high, starters for $12-$18 and mains from $22-$32, and two salads from $14-$18. However, they were apparently large enough to share... not really. The salad arrived and it was barely enough for 1 person, literally 4 bites and it was gone, $14 worth of lettuce and mint? The meatball appetizer came with 5 bite size balls, sitting on a slither of humous, barely Greek family style... humous is not delicate, put more in there please. Our main was the veal eggplant dish, I couldn't find much veal in there... maybe a few bits, my Greek baba's would be yelling at this chef by now. And finally the spanakopita came, it looked incredible, super creative presentation.. too bad it tasted like oven metal, isn't that sad? You must cure the ovenware! I was really hoping it would pull through, but no. 

We decided not to order anything else at this point, and we were not even full... imagine leaving a Greek family dinner hungry??? It's a sin, so was $120 for the meal I described above, with only one glass of wine and a beer.  At least the service was good, friendly smiles from start to end, however sad to say I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is a glowing review - because the place is whitewashed, brightly lit, and sparkly.

This adds to the vibrant ambiance, where everyone is having as much fun as you. On the three axes, Mamakas wins - service is on point despite being busy, the food (small plates anyway) were fresh, tasty, and seemingly authentic. The drink selection was appropriate, and the ouzo is affordable and rounds out the experience.

We're at a shortage of great Greek places in the west.... this is a welcome addition."}
{"text":"Very nice venue but food was disappointing. Had high expectations, tried the resto out before booking birthday dinner and thankfully I did or I would've felt bad."}
{"text":"I have eaten here five times and there is nothing I don't like. I am not really even into Greek food. Great atmosphere and cool vibe for a date."}
{"text":"Everything about Mamakas is perfect.  The staff is very informative and helpful. I had no reservation and waited only 20mins on a Friday night. This place is always packed! It's worth awaiting for! Seating by the kitchen is fun and entertaining. 
Thanks Chris!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to try Mamakas for a reallyyyyy long time - I liked the idea of a Greek restaurant not on the saturated Danforth area. 

When making resos online, Open Table told me there were only bar or high top tables available. Since I like a back to my seat, I chose the high top tables which were nice and intimate for two.

Love the interior, it's nice, cozy and all white for a dark and cold wintery night. I am going to say this now, and will repeat it later...they are EFFICIENT here! Plates come out one after another and we were done our apps and mains in 40 minutes. 

Please order one of the dips as it comes with warm and oh so yummy house-made pita bread. We got the eggplant dip and it was delish. With a bit of sweet honey, everything about this app was appetizing. Unfortunately, the night we were there, the resto had no more smelts for the night. We tried the fried meatballs which were ok.

For two, my husband and I decided to share the fresh fish which was grilled to perfection. The meat was tender and with good EVOO, the simple, but great flavors really hit the spot. Plates are meant to be shared so for two, the fish was enough plus a side.

Desserts are your usual Baklava and sweet desserts.

Service was great. Wine list all Greek which I love - it gives you a chance to try Greek wines. I ordered two glasses of a Gaia (categorized under the Lighter Red) and it was delish.

Overall, highly recommend Mamakas. It is great Greek Food, service and ambiance."}
{"text":"One of our favorited spots in TO for ding by. Good food, ok prices, great ambience and friendly service. All the dishes are good to great. Octopus main needs more flavour."}
{"text":"Great food. Grill branzino, lamb, quail, and lobster were great. So were the mussels. However the places needs a serious HVAC system - even the worst Korean BBQ places ventilate better than this. I should send them my dry cleaning bill."}
{"text":"Went to Mamakas for dinner on a Sunday. Love the decor inside and the open concept kitchen. For 3 people, we ordered the Spanokopita, Fried Smelt, Halloumi, Lamb and Octopus.  The dishes came out surprisingly fast and the service was above average. 

Spanokopita - Well prepared, decent size and comes in a spiral form
Fried Smelt - Not aesthetically pleasing to most people, but was amazing. Stuffed them down like popcorn at a movie theatre.
Halloumi - Very filling and delicious. Good balance of nuttiness (pistachio), sweet (strawberries) and savoury (cheese)
Lamb - Cooked medium, very tender and simple rub. Came with Tzaziki and a small salad.
Octopus - Very tender. The lemon sauce and capers complemented it very nicely

Overall, a memorable experience and will be back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"A fairly upscale Greek place, with some decent cocktails, absurd little fried fish, tasty-but-uneven octopus, very tender lamb chops, and excellent appetizer dips.

The server suggested doing things family-style --- order a plate of chops for the table, not as a meal for yourself.  This worked well --- one person ran a little short of bread with the dips, but everything split up into four chunks well.

Drink-wise, I tried the \"Mov\" --- gin, egg white, blueberry shrub, lemon, and a few other things.  Nicely frilly and frothy, which is what I was looking for.

The \"Atherina\" fried smelts were delicious --- sort of an rich, oily, fishy version of popcorn shrimp.

The \"Oktapódi\" octopus was a little uneven --- my quarter was delicious, but some of the other legs came out a little dry.

Dessert-wise, the \"Galaktoboureko\" was more airy and less chocolatey than expected, but tasty.  The milk-and-honey icecream had a great flavor, and fine (though slightly icey) texture.

Excellent service.

Having a reservation helped significantly on a Thursday evening."}
{"text":"Word on the street was that Ossington had a popping new Greek joint with good food.  Read the Yelp reviews and was pretty conflicted by the ratings; the ratings were either 5 stars or 1. What I noticed was that all the 5 stars reviews were for the food, and the 1 star reviews were for the price of the food. My review will be about the overall experience. 

All dishes are meant to be shared, similar to tapas but larger in size. 

What we ate: 

Imam Baildi  - Eggplant, Tomato confit, caramelized onion, fresh thyme $12 (6/10) - This olive oil braised eggplant was served with a slice of bread. The eggplant was well cooked and booming with onion and thyme flavor. The only disappointment was that the bread served with the dish was vividly burnt. The burnt side of the bread was flipped over and it made me wonder whether the chef knew it was burnt and served it anyway. 

Horta - Baby organic dandelion salad $12 (6/10) - The description is a bit deceiving. It's not the yellow dandelion you imagine on your lawn. Also it's not so much of a cold salad, rather a sautéed green vegetable dish with garlic. In all honestly, this was identical to a Chinese wok fried choy dish. Tasty, just wasn't what we expected after reading the description. 

Psari - Whole grilled fish-catch of the day $55 (5/10) - The catch of the day was a yellow sword fish. Grilled, doused in olive oil, and de-boned. A little disappointed at this dish, especially if the fish is valued at $55 I expect to be writing home about it. It was a basic white fish. It wasn't terrible, but it definitely didn't taste like it was fresh and it wasn't entirely deboned. 

Padiakia - Ontario lamb chops $24 (5/10) -Medium rare grilled lamb chops. The meat needed more seasoning, tenderizing and a bit more game (freshness of the meat is questionable).  Tasted like any meat.


Rating Summary: 

Food: 5/10 - average for the items noted above. The food wasn't terrible, but also nothing spectacular for what you expect to experience with the amount of money you're spending on each dish. 

Atmosphere: 8/10 - Packed house on a Tuesday night, good Greek music, homely and modern interior design. Only caveat, the exposed kitchen will leave you smelling like your dinner for the next week. 

Service: 7/10 - Water service needed improvement and food service was generally slow. It was just over an hour from the time of ordering to when all four dishes came out .

Overall, food was decent (neither terrible nor spectacular).  However, I would agree with the other reviewers and note the price you're paying for the food isn't worth it. I'd come back for the scene and drinks, but not the food. 

P.S  - there is a charge for water, yes, includes still tap water."}
{"text":"The food quality is good. However the pricing is kind of excessive for what it is. The ceviche is alright but too much dill and lemon. To be honest I could make better at home. We also got the grilled fish which was burnt on the outside so it was really hard to eat. They don't change the oil for their fries it seems which is why the fries are so dark. Should not have ordered them . The sevice was fantastic however and ambiance nice and lively which I like especially if you have no plans after dinner it's kind of a nice pseudo bar scene. Also beware some of the prices on the menu aren't what they are. We got charged $14 for the spanakopita which were $8 on the menu. Not that much better overall than a danforth Greek restaurant. Go on the danforth, better portions and pricing!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Mamakas for a while.  We booked a reservation a while back for this past Saturday night.  We arrived on time, and were promptly seated.  The first thing to note, however, is how crammed the restaurant is, particularly the entrance.  I got the feeling that they were trying to jam as many people in there as possible, comfort or accessibility be damned!  

We were seated at a table at the back, right by the window.  It was lovely, but the acoustics in this place were pretty bad, and surely not helped by the number of people crammed into the restaurant.    

We ordered quite a few dishes:
- Red pepper spread and pitas (definitely get a dip with pitas - the pitas are awesome)
- Cured Swordfish (I enjoyed it, my husband thought the fish was mostly hidden by the accompaniments)
- Halloumi with strawberries (good, but more of a dessert than an app as it was quite sweet)
- Horiatiki salad (I may have misspelled that - the feta made that salad, otherwise it would be pretty ordinary)
- The grilled octopus (tender and delightfully charred)
- The eggplant (just okay, as long as it was on bread, otherwise a mushy pile of goo)

We received the first four dishes within ten minutes of ordering, three dishes in the first go round and another one five minutes later.  While everything was reasonably tasty, bringing four dishes that quickly for a table of two is bad service in my books.  We told the runner to put a hold on bringing any more food, and her awkward response was off-putting.  

When we finished off that first round, we got our mains.  The octopus was good, the eggplant was okay.  We settled up and went home.  Overall, the food was pretty good, but the experience was dragged down by the service and atmosphere.  Maybe I would go back, but it would have to be on a less busy night.  With so many great places nearby, however, I'm not sure I would bother."}
{"text":"We loved this place. Stopped in on a busy weekday night and quickly got a seat at the kitchen. We would highly recommend sitting there when you dine here.

We quickly fell in love with the atmosphere and friendliness of the staff. We ordered the rose which was crisp, refreshing and light. It paired perfectly with the smoked trout appetizer. The food was absolutely fantastic, both complex and authentic."}
{"text":"First time I went to Mamakas, my boyfriend and I were absolutely blown away by the food. It was the best Greek in Toronto thus far.  We had 4 apps and the chicken and Market fish- a Porgy.  Both divine and so, so we'll done.... As cheesy as it may sound I really felt this was cooked with love and pride by the chef.  As well as two desserts we found absolutely fabulous.  

The service on the other hand was pretty bad.  Our server didn't initially approach us until about 15 minutes in. When she did it was quite rushed (it was busy, to be fair). Her menu knowledge was barely there and knowledge of the restaurants liquor was zero.  We were super interested in a tequila and she went on telling us it was a tequila we knew. After our meal, we again, could not locate our missing server so we had to order our tequilas with the owner who told us that what we were ordering was absolutely wrong, and he was confused why we thought so.... Kinda funny. 

The food was worth it though.  So we made a reservation for a week from that day for 6 to bring our family to this wonderful resto. 

We came back a week later to find the service was a bit better and friendlier (more existent) but the food was an absolute disappointment. Which was very upsetting at we dragged our family out, singing Mamaka's praises.  

Our lamb chops came out before most of our apps and the rest trickled in the next 15 minutes.  We ordered two orders of chicken that came 30 minutes later than everyone else's dishes. We were warned of the delay of food coming out (and were pretty easy). Once our chicken came it looked gorgeous but undercooked :( bad enough for either of us not to really touch it and when our server came over and saw the full dishes in front of us she offered to just pack it up. 

I don't think we'll be returning because inconsistency is the worst."}
{"text":"We have a winner on our hand here folks. I have seen this place crop up without much fan fare then I started to see the crowds gather and was more intrigued how the food was here. 
This was an unplanned visit as was in the area. We had time to kill so came in and looked at the menu and decided to visit this spot after looking at the menu (should have checked what's available as well more on than later)
I enjoy Greek cuisine and was thinking to try out the classics to get a better idea on where they stand. My DC wanted to have chicken and found out later that was it wasn't being sold that day. Anyway here is what we ordered 
Haloomi: Hit it out of park just gorgeous presentation and with a nice balance of citrus and carrot puree. Fried just right and was quite fresh too I think as its unlike the store bought version I am used too.
Spanakopita : Done very well again. Very rich as expected and I recommend it sharing among 3-4 people if having mains.
Octopus: I use this as a yardstick for Greek food along with the lavraki to asses the kitchen skills on seafood. Hmm this was OK not great. While charred nicely it was a bit more chewy than I would expect at a place that does other dishes so well.
Moussaka (vegetarian): Oh boy this is the highlight of the dishes I tried on this visit. Just gorgeous as it is just so hard to elevate a vegetable dish let alone make it stand out this way over a cuisine which is mainly known for their meats. This is the best Moussaka I have ever had. Gorgeous perfectly cooked vegetables cut paper thin and layer upon layer of flavor. Bechamel topping the dish was also done just right. I will be back just to try this out.
Potatos side was forgetful. 
Wine list as expected is mainly Greek wines and are reasonably priced with good options by the glass. 
The place gets crowded real fast as seemed like many of them were regulars so I would recommend making a reservations even on weekdays. I think this by far one of the best Greek food spots in Toronto! I will be back to try out the other classics
4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"The most memorable dish for me here is the grill lamb chops. For that alone I think I would name Mamakas the best Greek food in town. Nonetheless, of items on the menu that I have tried (spinach & feta phyllo, fried smelts, cured swordfish, grilled octopus, and roasted eggplant), all are stellar."}
{"text":"Ate at this place last week and loved it!  The place was packed and the food was fantastic.  We had the spanakopita, which was so delicious, we had another!  Then we had the lamb chops and the octopus as mains.  I loved them both.  And then finished it off with a black pepper infused goat milk rum drink with goat cheesecake with a fig.  It was so delicious that I was having what I call, food orgasms all night.  The atmosphere was wonderful, staff were fun and the owner and main bartender are both so passionate about what they are doing, it was nice to watch and relish in their creations."}
{"text":"Greek food experience at its best! Tzatziki and tirramosalata with pita are great starters. The pita is the best I've ever had. Order the spinakopita, chicken and horatiki salad. We paired our meal with a bottle of Malamatina (retsina). Atmosphere is lovely and the service was terrific."}
{"text":"Meh. He food was okay. I was not super impressed by the vegetarian options. The cocktails are fantastic, the service is impeccable, and the spanikopita can't be beat. 

Wife ordered the beef dish and was unable to finish it due to the \"off\" taste. 

Go for cocktails!"}
{"text":"We came here after hearing so many good reviews from friends. All I have to say is...WOW! The place is small but quaint, feels very homey and the service was good.
The food was delicious! It wasn't too heavy....depending on what dish you order of course. The grill whole fish was the star of the night! Salt and pepper drizzled with olive oil and sliced lemon on the side. Simple but delicious! The house dip was good as well. The salad exceeded our expectations. My husband doesn't like olive and he ate the salad. The brown/purple olive paste wasn't too overwhelming. It blended perfectly with the feta cheese, tomatoes and purple onion.
The fries were surprisingly good. I didn't expect to have feta cheese and tzatziki dip with my fries.
Left the restaurant full and happy. We didn't feel heavy and overstuffed. It was a bit pricey for some items, but given that the food was delicious, and service was good, I don't mind paying for it. We would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This super cool spot is the closest experience to Santorini without hopping on a plane. 
The food and ambience are both authentic enough to leave out the funny \"opa\" references and blue & white flags. I really enjoyed my time here. I even perched myself at the bar ordering as much as possible to observe it all being prepared before my eyes. Delicious, savoury, clean and trendy. Go here."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Mamakas for about a year now, mainly from a friend who couldn't stop singing its praises. I finally had an opportunity to check it out and I have to say I wasn't let down at all.  We arrive and are seated immediately, even though we haven't had any reservations.  I would recommend making reservations though, they filled up pretty quickly on the Monday night. 

Our server was lovely, and informative.  I mentioned it was my first time here and she made suggestions on what and how many of each course to order. She also recommended a Metaxa Mule as I like cocktails that aren't too sweet. 

As per the norm, we ordered waaay too much for just two people and all the food arrived promptly - in fact the only complaint I really have is that the food arrived pretty much all at the same time and we felt a bit rushed to eat it all (I know, it's tragic), but our server did apologize a couple times. 

The food here is meant to be shared, so order a few dishes and family style it. 

Must order:
Lamb - Perfectly cooked, if you enjoy lamb rare to mid-rare, melts in your mouth, and sits on a bed of tzaiki and bulgar. 

Octopus - tender pieces of tentacle served with pickled onions and capers. My fav octopus in the city thus far. 

Dips - I only tried two of the four listed - the Taramousalata, fish based dip that has the texture of mousse, it was very light and tasty, and the Kopanisti which is feta with roasted red pepper. It's a little coarser than the first dip but just as good. It's served with the most amazing, freshly baked pita bread. I could sit there and eat bread and dip all day.

The only dish I didn't enjoy as much was the eggplant dish. I found a bit under seasoned for my tastes. 

Thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish (their desserts are divine!) and would return in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This place brings a much-needed Greek gem to the otherwise deprived Toronto area (outside of Danforth, of course!) 

What I loved - it's very fancy food served in an environment that is anything but. The prices are \"fine dining\" but the atmosphere is fun, cozy and casual all at once. The atmosphere is lively - strikingly so. Loved the strings of lights that hung from the walls as they made you feel at home. That's exactly how I envision Greek fare - homely and unpretentious. Our table of eight fit comfortably despite the venue's fairly small size. 

The food did not disappoint - in particular, the bread and dips we had as an appetizer (there were four of the latter which were so delicious, especially the babaganoush and an orange-coloured one that was full of cheese). You must try them!

The rest of the meal (we opted for the fixed menu - $65 per person) was very nice. A loooooot of food (in fact I might suggest you come with your friends and share a few plates in lieu of a fixed menu set - we had 15 boxes of packed food at the end!). Highlights were the tender lamb chops and a resplendent spinach and cheese-filled phyllo pastry. I'm not much of a fish eater but the fish at our table must have been great as it disappeared quickly! Dessert was also wonderful - a selection of ice creams (with such unique flavours - cardamom, honey, something reminiscent of gingerbread, etc.) as well as some sort of pastry which I didn't try (too full by that point) but heard was great. 

The only misses - there was a half-hour gap between serving our penultimate and last dish (dessert!) which wasn't ideal (but once dessert cake we gobbled it up fast). There were also a few dishes that weren't as memorable (eg a pepper covered in olive (?) oil). Overall I'm happy to forgive - a dinner I really enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Very nice ambience and great service. Quality of food was great. Best lamb ever. Make sure you try olive oil ice cream! Very interesting. This place is going to be a fave for us from now on."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best Greek restaurants in Toronto hands down and far, far away from the Danforth so hold your OPAs. Delicious, modern takes on classic Greek dishes set in the hip and trendy Ossington area. I'd highly suggest the Sunday lunch. They offer smaller portions of their regular dinner menu and it's not as busy. Great service. I'd say this is mid-range + in terms of price. I don't know who is complaining about portions because we left stuffed and very happy.

---Spanakopita: Outstanding spinach filled phyllo topped with honey and set on a bed of delicious greek yogurt. Tangy, sweet and rich. Three more please.
---Halloumi: Would have preferred the cheese to be a bit warmer but with the squash, apple and pecan compote/puree underneath, it was a great marriage
---Tiganites Patates: Pretty spectacular. Umami
---Calamari: Served with fried chickpeas and chickpea puree. This was just okay for me.

Great cappuccinos and cocktails. $2 sparkling water. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Food is great service sucks.

So sit at the bar and order direct from the chefs.

They'll take your order and you get to bypass the staff in the back, actually it was only one waitress who really ruined it for us, the others are truly great.

This place offers next level create Greek food, fantastic and delicious and packs with flavours."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and enjoyed each occasion. However , this time we were sat at the bar where they are preparing the food, rather than a table. On the whole, I would recommend the table. Although watching them prepare food was fun . The noise level is still high no matter where you sit.
They have some really lovely Greek white wines, in particular those from Santorini.
The service, as always, was lovely and friendly and efficient.

We had the taramasalata which is a rich and with a strong garlic/onion flavour. We also had the yellowtail  'tenos'. This is a cold dish of cucumber, fennel, yoghurt and blood orange - a really good combination with the raw fish. We shared the sea bream which was plentiful and succulent - interestingly they take a blowtorch to singe it and finish it off before being carried to the table! Finally, we hand the lamb chops with french fries and brussels sprouts all of which were excellent."}
{"text":"Went to Mamakas on the recommendation of my Greek coworker for a friend's birthday dinner. Quick run-down:

- great service, attentive but not over-bearing
- great modern twist on classic Greek fare
- cute venue with interesting art, good for a date night
- would definitely go back
- $$$

I went here with a group. There was 8 of us and everyone loved their food. We pretty much ended up all sharing because it was all so good.

I'll start with what I ordered, which was the stifado (braised beef cheek). Holy crap this was amazing! The meat was so tender and whatever they marinated the meat in, it was superb. It came on a bed of what I think was potato puree with some sort of glaze drizzled on the meat and the puree. Onion, sunchokes and a few roasted baby potatoes. The dish looks rather small when it comes out, but the meat is surprisingly filling and I was at a good point when I finished. Perfectly content.

I also tried the mousakas, spanikopita (probably my second favourite dish), and the pork belly gyro. All were fantastic dishes. We got a few orders of the house dips, which came with freshly baked bread that was amazing on its own. Our waiter messed up and gave us an extra dip, we let him know and he let us have it for free. We also had their dark chocolate & tahini icecream. It was a very interesting combo. First bite, I thought \"ehhhh\" second bite, \"okay, okay this is interesting\" third bite \"yeah, I like this\" it has an almost peanut buttery taste that is slightly salty but decidedly good.

One of my friends has a pretty severe nut allergy and when we told our server he pointed out the dishes that didn't contain any nuts and when he brought the dessert menu he did the same thing. Which was very helpful.

I love Greek food and have been to a number of Greek restaurants on the Danforth that were on point and I would say this restaurant stacks up really well against them. I would also recommend making a reservation. We went on a Wednesday evening for 7:30 and the restaurant quickly filled up.

Final answer, I would most definitely go back. That braised beef cheek.... **sigh"}
{"text":"Love Mamakas! Great ambience and the food is delicious (a bit pricey but worth it). My favourite dishes so far are the saganaki, halloumi with grilled peach, fresh pita, and lamb with tzatziki. The only downfall for the place is that the staff is hit or miss; they're either amazing or can be a bit rude, which is unfortunate because it really takes away from having an overall positive experience. However, the dishes and drinks are fantastic so I continue to go. Definitely make a reservation. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best meals I've had anywhere. I love Greek food.  The extremely knowledgable waiter helped us select the best bottle of white wine which went perfectly with the lite, nearly mousse like taramasalata, grilled pita, olives and grilled Octopus.  

So simple at first glance, but each dish was created from meticulously selected and costly imported ingredients prepared with a variety of methods ranging from pickling, sous vide, grilling and braising. Truly a wonderful meal made better by its spontaneity. (Planned to go to union based on recommendations but they were booked for the night). I will be back EVERY TIME I visit Toronto.

Place is a little tight, but feels homey while being a bit contemporary and clean. Pricey and portioned conservatively, but so worth it. 

Definitely give it a shot."}
{"text":"Incredible Greek food! 
Beautiful setting, delicious food and amazing service 
Servers are extremely friendly and knowledgeable- they are keen to teach you about new Greek foods and wine 

Perfect for date night or special occasion"}
{"text":"Let bed this place...authentic tavern in Ossington...I gave these guys 4 stars although it's a casual place, because of the food and service not the ambiance. We had 3 or 4 Mezes plus the village salad and I can honestly say everything tasted delicious. For the main course I ordered the lamb chubs and it was heavenly. One thing for sure I am going back."}
{"text":"** GOOD but EXPENSIVE **
The food was great but I felt it was over priced. Now I say this because I love me some Greek food but I found I was paying for the hype and the Ossington atmosphere. However, my fiancé ordered the Lamb and it was probably some of the best cooked Lamb I've had from any Greek restaurant, but I ordered the classic Moussaka and it was medium at best and way too expensive which is a shame since it's such an iconic Greek dish. Service was fabulous. Our server was prompt and extremely friendly. It was a busy Wednesday night during holidays and she was not stressed and did not rush us for dessert or the bill. 


Make a reservation if you want to go as they are quite popular. Will I be coming back? Unfortunately not. They are the only Greek restaurant in the West Queen West area, so if you're craving some Greek on a romantic date night than this is your best bet!"}
{"text":"Favourite Greek spot in town. Rahil was our waiter and treated us like family. Lamb chops and sea bream fish was the best I've ever had, grilled, baked and torched afterwards."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here for the first time a couple of weeks ago and we had a fantastic experience. We ordered 2 appetizers (the spanakopita and the cheese saganaki), 2 mains (sheftalia and paidakia), a side of handcut potatoes and the baklava for dessert. The spanakopita was so nice and crispy on the outside and the yogurt at the bottom paired very well with it. The lamb chops were very tender and well seasoned. Although, my favourite was definitely the baklava with the milk and honey ice cream! Lastly, our waiter was great and brought out our food at a good time. I recommend this place for a date night or a birthday!"}
{"text":"One of the best Greek taverna in Toronto. The food at Mamakas is elevated rustic Aegean cuisine at its finest. My favourite dishes were the fish (I think it was a seabass) and the lamb - although, all of the dishes were excellent. I would recommend going with a few friends so that you can share a few dishes to get the full experience at Mamakas.  Save room for dessert! 

Mamakas is always busy so I would highly recommend getting a reservation."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is lovely. The ambiance is great, service was amazing and the food was phenomenal. Went here for date night. We tried tzatziki, bread, sea bass and lamb chops. Everything was delicious. I highly recommend the bread and dips. I will be coming back again. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"For the food that we received and the price that we paid, we definitely DID NOT get our money's worth!!! Service was great and the atmosphere was ok but i mean lets be honest when we all go out to eat at a restaurant because we are hungry, we expect to at least get full after paying more than $100. 
My husband and I will definitely never go back. We will stick to greek town!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and ambiance. Lovely and refined wine selection and boutique crafted cocktails are gorgeous and well designed. The food... hmm. .. difficult. Get some help from the wait staff for sure.  (Who are lovely, effecient and so professional.) Bc the sharing plates are significant but the mains are small etc. The fries are divine, a true double fried frites that are seasoned plenty and leave a lasting impression. 

Only order the smelts if you are die hard into them or have more then two table mates hahaha... Bc omg the serving is massive and also delicious. The spreads and pita are too die for. The olives are a definite skip, not worth it, over burdened with spices and oil and very hard. Apparently they are supposed to be, so if that's your thing... well enjoy! But I'm more of a olive crazed lunatic so I want my olives ripe, succulent and varied. 
The saganaki was understated and adorned with figs, honey and walnuts making it my favourite item 100%. The Parmasan crusted asparagus was my second fave. 

The sausage and hummus dish. Not my bag, S.O. loved it. To me it was far too.... everything. The texture was more towards overcooked even though it certainly was not and the spicing was too fall/winter for me. Again, S.O. loved it, but he likes pumpkin spice and is a simple betch whereas I'm a fussy orenary 90 yr old with halatosis so... grain of salt. 

Will absolutely return for sharing with more ppl, but would gladly attend for a romantic date as well."}
{"text":"This is the best Greek restaurant in the city! The interior is beautiful and the food is packed with flavour. There are so many great options on the menu, with the Spanakopita being one of my favourites and probably the best one I've ever had. The fish is amazing, and one of the cooks was kind enough to show us how it was made when we were seated at the bar. All in all one of my favourite places to eat and I cannot recommend it enough!"}
{"text":"The lamb chops is at one of the best price points. Great flavour, well cooked and juicy. I dream about it."}
{"text":"So... first of all it's the first Greek restaurant that feels Greek without using 25 pictures of Acropolis and another 43 of Santorini!
So atmosphere is really nice.
The Greek recipes are very interesting but the portions are ridiculously small. So small that I've lost one of the meatballs in my mouth. Maybe I swallowed it, don't know.
Yes, some products are imported, most are vegetables but still, I know the costs and it doesn't add up to $18 for 2 bites of Greek salad. The green beans were the biggest I've ever seen so GMO was the first thing that came in my mind.
The taste was really good no complaints there but definitely not a traditional Greek food, and It's not very nice to leave a restaurant hungry and a bit furious when you see the total $.

We'll go back for sure for drinks and an appetizer but not if we are hungry.
Regulars if they double the portions (not the prices)"}
{"text":"It's pricy, but for the service and food - I thought it was well worth my money! Fair price if you're splitting with a friend, but fairly pricy if you're footing the bill for a date - but overall, I'd come back again :)

Spanakopita - HOLY FASHIZZLE. It's one of those crumbly pastries where it just hits the spot when you're feeling ravenous. The exterior was a buttery, flaky crust and the inside was practically stuffed to the brim with spinach and feta(?) - 10/10 would recommend

Lamb chops - Pretty popular dish and with good reason. Tender lamb chops on smear of tabouleh and tzatziki sauce. I recommend skipping the house dip order of tzatziki if you're getting this - 10/10 would recommend 

Octopus - This dish kind of paled in comparison to the previous two, but still delicious. It's a pretty small dish, so don't expect this to act as a main. Fairly tender, but could've used a bit more sauce - 7.5/10 would recommend

Overall, it's a cute place and I highly recommend reservations (OpenTable), unless you don't mind sitting at the bar near the entrance (but not optimal for winter). The food came out extremely quick and the servers were fairly attentive! 

Would go back to check out the fish and baklava :)!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. Everything we had - the taramosalata, mussels, octopus, horiatiki salad, sweetbreads, lamb, sea bass carpaccio and dessert - was perfectly cooked and amazing!

The place is really cute and has a great vibe and buzz. Will definitely go back. :)"}
{"text":"Wow, one of the best places that I have been for dinner in a long, long time. This place is a gem in Toronto and if you have yet to visit you are missing out!

We came here to celebrate our anniversary and were blown away by the service and food. The atmosphere is quaint, tables are pretty close together so be prepared to get cosy with your neighbour!

We ordered three appys and two mains:
- tzatziki: lemony, citrus-y, creamy. Must try. Pita's served warm, and are very salty. 
- spanakopita: the layers of phyllo are dusted with a sweet honey and the spinach gives it quite the flavour. 
- soutzoukakia: from what I was told, these were phenomenal. My partner ate them in seconds. 
- kounoupidi: WOW. so much flavour for a dish. served with this roasted tomato sauce that is absolutely to die for. 
- paidakia: this is a full portion. little underwhelming, but definitely worth the try. 

The drinks are great too! Moscow mule is spicy and packed with flavor. Our waitress was the sweetest and brought us some champagne to celebrate. 

Will return! (Also, be prepared to dish out $$$. Not cheap)."}
{"text":"Recently ate here for the second time and similar to the first, it did not disappoint. Servings are generally family sized and meant for sharing. I would highly recommend the Spanakopita to start along with the House dips (we had the Melitzanosalata but you can't go wrong with any of the 4 choices). We had the Grilled lamb chops and Grilled octopus which were fantastic. The lamb chops were by far some of the best tasting I have tried - perfectly grilled and slides right off the bone. The octopus was perfectly textured and extremely tasty with the added caper and pickled onion. For dessert, the milk & honey ice cream was the perfect way to finish a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"This was our first time at the restaurant and we were not disappointed. The service and food were great. The ambiance was your typical Greek restaurant, simple but clean. It was a bit noisy but that is expected from a 'trendy' and popular place. We had the fish and chicken. They were both very tasty and very good portions. The pita was unbelievable delicious. Would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Fish, apps, service, environment everything was great! We love Greek food and always used to go to Greek Town. After our experience here, will not go any other Greek restaurant ever!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful decor and the amazing ambiance, when I entered this restaurant. My wife's cocktail were amazing and so was the swordfish carpaccio. The rest of the meal was \"meh\". But where it all went downhill, is when our waiter was so quick to take our plates before we were finished. So quick to take our menus too. Kinda like he wanted to turn over the table super quick. Pretty pricey for what I got, to top it off. Bill came up to $70 for 3 small dishes and a cocktail, and that was before the tip. I don't think I will be returning to this establishment. Being Greek, the food did not remind me even close to what my Yiayia used to make."}
{"text":"Holy cow, this place was super amazing!!!  No wonder it was so packed when we tried to get a table.  The taramousalada was the softest and most fluffy I have ever had.  The grilled octopus was super tender and flavorful.  The service was friendly and attentive.  I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Just what we needed on a Sunday stroll on Ossington. The food is beautifully presented and tastes as good as it looks. Super fresh ingredients and made to order."}
{"text":"This was a fun change of pace.
Loved the pitas and the taramsalta dip was great. By far the most generous portion as well.
The swordfish crudo was elegant clean flavors with radish and peppers but a tiny portion.  However it was delicious. 

Goat Tartare was great loved the texture and the beets. Portion was ok but smallish. I'd definitely get this again.

Octopus was excellent but small for a main. It would have seemed small for an app. 

Great cocktails and a decent red wine. 
The baklava ice cream dessert was delicious a perfect fit for the menu.

The space is great, the tables are tight however. 

Would i go back? Yes but not if I'm super hungry. But the flavor was perfect."}
{"text":"I was so ready to be swept off my feet by this popular Greek resto in Ossington. Reality was that even though the space was really inviting and beautiful, the food was a different story for me.

First impression was great, what a good looking & live spot. Trendy decor with cultural accents and a bustling open kitchen greeting you right after the front doors. The hanging lights from the ceiling added a warm touch and comfortable level of lighting. Very fun and homey vibe.

This place was packed on a Friday night, we were barely able to squeeze through the crowd of people at the front. Reservation seems to be a must. 

Now for the food:
- Spanakopita $12: Traditional spinach and feta filled pie which is essentially a stuffed puff pastry. Was an interesting and flavourful dish but slightly too dry and acidic. 
- Roasted eggplant $14: A roasted eggplant with tomato, onion and walnuts on top. The walnuts were a good touch but it was under-seasoned and flavours were forgettable.
- Vine ripe tomatoes and feta salad $18: Not bad but really overpriced for a small bowl of tomatoes and feta cheese. 
- Grilled octopus $20: The octupus was tender but the flavours weren't inspiring and tasted just okay. 
- Grilled lamb chops $30: Not the best ending to our meal.. the lamb was gamy and lacked juiciness. 

Maybe we just didn't order the best items but I really wished we had a better experience with the food. They have some really key ingredients for a cute date spot which was confirmed by the fact that Jonas Valanciunus and his wife sat down at a table right next to us for a dinner date! 

Raptors star gawking aside.. It was really 2 star affair for the food and mediocre value but +1 bonus star for the great ambiance and charming decor. Sorry Mamakas, wasn't a fan."}
{"text":"Came for my parents anniversary and had a fabulous time!

Food 4/5: Four of us shared atherina, house dips, spanakopita, psari, oktapodi, roasted brussel sprouts and lamb chops! Everything was fresh and declious. In particular I loved the smelts and dips. The pitas were warm and drizzled with olive oil however you only get 2 per dip which isn't nearly enough. The lost star is because the portions were disappointingly small. 

Service 5/5: Our sever was fantastic! My parents aren't familiar with Greek food and had tons of questions but he was super patient and friendly. The food came out at a good pace and our table was constantly cleared and reset.

Atmosphere 4/5: Very pretty and romantic but the tables are a bit too close together. I could hear the entire conversation of the group next to us."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows that I'm easily won over by delicious, juicy, fatty lamb ribs on a brunch menu--which, until Mamakas, I'd only encountered in NYC.

The lobster benedict is a great idea (also haven't seen that on any other brunch menus in the city) and well executed.

The previous incarnation of the french toast (with berries and mastika cream, if I recall correctly) was a very satisfying, sweet third course for me.  I look forward to trying the new \"baklava\" variation!

I've been to Mamakas for dinner as well, which was great--but in my opinion, it is their brunch that is exceptional."}
{"text":"Oh Mamakas, how quickly you captured my heart! I dedicate my 100th review to your lovely charm, friendly wait staff and delectable food. You are my favourite of 2015.

I remember walking into this cosy resto on a wintry night in December and wow! What a vibrant atmosphere. This Greek taverna was the only Ossington establishment packed on Tuesday night and with a waitlist at that. Picture warm chatter, polished white decor, stucco walls lit by incandescent patio lights... it's as if you've been transported to your Greek grandmother's house.

I've been here a few times and absolutely love the halloumi, the grilled lamb chops as well as the grilled fish of the day. Dessert cannot be passed up if you've a sweet tooth. Finally, make reservations if you intend to drop by as this space only seats 85.

Looking forward to the next visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Our first time there tonight and is now by far our favourite Greek food (coming from my Greek hubby that means something!) The most delicious spanakopita we've ever had.  Light and flakey filo, washed in honey served over thick yoghurt.   Eggplant dip another winner (very unique and delicious) as well as the saganaki, roasted eggplant appetizer and Greek fries.   Finished it with meat dessert...lamb chops and two glasses of Greek wine.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. 

Had a client visiting the city and wanted to go for a late dinner. 

Our options were limited as it was 9pm on a Tuesday night. I knew this place was new and who doesn't like Greek food?

We walked in and the sous chef immediately informed us that the kitchen had just closed.. (Yet they still had half of the restaurant filled with people) Took a bit of charm on our end and he told us he's re-open the kitchen for us! 

Not only that, he made us special lamb chops and truffle fries. Which were both delicious! 

The manager came by for a quick chat and made us feel welcome, the waitress was all smiles and seemed like she loved what she does. 

After our meal we obviously had to leave a larger than normal gratuity for all their hospitality, the chef came and gave us his card and told us to let him know anytime we wanted to return or have anything catered.  

Happy employees and good customer service really made this a stellar dining experience. Keep it up! 

Definitely going to be returning with more people."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pretty casual. The restaurant caters to all ages, groups, couples, friends, etc.. Whatever you want this place to be, it becomes that. The drinks were great and the servers were all nice. Really interesting decor elements but it got noisy VERY fast. 

And about the food.. I personally did not like most of it except for the lamb and the octopus. Their pita was fresh out of the oven but was drenched in olive oil + super dough-y. Food in general were salty. I love mediterranean food but every single dish was salty, even the fries!

BUT despite the saltiness, the lamb was SO good and the octopus was SO tender. I'd come back just for those 2 dishes :) Hummus was on point too."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice - fun, light, relaxed - perfect for our group. Service was also excellent. The food was delicious. The only criticism would have been value for price: the baklava french toast and lobster eggs benedict that we enjoyed were truly delicious, but a bit pricey for the quantity."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and food, the waiters were great but the busboy was a hustler, we all watched him worked and we felt we would hire him in a heartbeat. Bartender was great, I loved my drink. The piece de resistance of the evening was the Octopus, although everything else was awesome, we all loved the octopus. Our waiter said, the kalamari was great but the Oct0pus is amazing. We got both. Next time I am in Toronto I will return. ( the space is also really nice)."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I have been to Greece and visited the islands and the feta cheese and olive oil in the Horiatiki Salad brought me back to Santorini. I will be back to try more dishes! We ordered a bottle of white wine which accompanied our dishes perfectly. We decided to share plates so we ordered the horiatiki (greek) salad and some eggplant dip with pita. We then ordered lamb chops and a side of fries and it was the perfect amount of food for two. We were too full for dessert but we will definitely be coming back for more greek cuisine. Service was attentive and our waitress provided us recommendations on dishes which were all top notch! Delicious food, nice ambiance, and great service."}
{"text":"Great fun and bright atmosphere. Came with 3 girlfriends, all with various food allergies (vegetarian, lactose, gluten-free). We each found several options for us on the menu, but best of all, is probably the extensive cocktail list!! (pricey at $14 a pop, however). Our server was incredibly knowledgeable about all items on the menu and provided us with sound guidance as we made our choices. 

The spanikopita is seriously like crack. There is a honey drizzle that provides a lovely addition.
The octopus was much better than any of the \"trendy octopus\" dishes served by many of Toronto's west-end restaurants. 
We had a bunch of other things -- the eggplant appetizer dish was quite meaty for a veg option; fairly heavy. 

Overall, excellent service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Mamaka's offers a modern/hipster/Westernized take on Greek cuisine. The food is not authentic Greek food but rather spin offs with interesting tastes and insta-worthy presentations....but that's what you're overpaying for. The octopus was delicious and the chicken was probably the best bang for your buck. If you're familiar with mountain tea, do yourself a favour and try their cocktail. Overall, cute drinks-only/date atmosphere. Special props for the karaggiozi mural!"}
{"text":"Really delicious Greek food! Mamakas Taverna is located on the Ossington strip, flanked by (and on par with) some of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. I recommend the Karida (coconut and lime) cocktail to start. Of the house dips, I think the eggplant one is the best. The feta one is a bit salty for my liking. Order at least one full pita bread per person - you won't regret it! Other highlights included the whole grilled fish of the day (sea bream) and lamb chops. I probably would not order the Greek salad or tuna tartare again - they were good but not particularly memorable. Note that the lamb chops come with a healthy serving of tzatziki so either order extra pita breads or save some of your appetizer bread! Also you may be tempted to skip dessert because Bang Bang is right across the street, but DON'T MAKE THIS MISTAKE! Order the baklava with honey ice cream and then get Bang Bang as your second dessert."}
{"text":"Pricey, mediocre food. For brunch, it's a no. Youre paying for the ambiance, i like to pay for my food.

We went for brunch. I was banking on them having what looked to me like the best item on their menu--custard pie, bougatsa--but they didn't have it and thus i was forced to find something else on the menu, which did not impress me. We settled for the baklava inspired french toast but it was not good: dry and unflavourful. We also shared the white omlette which was equally unmemorable and the melizanosalata which was not as tasty as it seemed to be. It didnt seem as though the establishment was willing to make concessions for us--if we could take two dips rather than a full portion, or get sufficient syrup for the french toast that was particularly dry..... for the price, they really should be more open to better customer service.

The place was expensive and again, unimpressive. Would not recomend for brunch."}
{"text":"I am not the type of person to go online and write reviews about restaurants but I felt compelled to do so.

My boyfriend and I arrived at Mamakas with great anticipation as we have been wanting to try them out for over a year.  This was suppose to be a special night for us, celebrating our anniversary but it turned out to be one of the worst dinning experiences we've ever endured.

1.) Service: HORRIBLE. I was confused about the wines as I am not too familiar with greek wines. Our server was not only condescending but also very rude. As I made my final decision she walked away, rolling her eyes with a half smirk. I was appalled. This set the tone for the entire night as she was rude and short with us throughout service.

2.) FOOD: Our appetizers and salad were fantastic. Beautiful olive oil used and simplicity of the dish. When our mains came, we were in anticipation of two of our favourites. Octopus and lamb chops.

After taking one bite of the lamb chop, I almost gagged. It was like they had dumped the entire bottle of salt on these chops. They were so over the top salty that they were inedible.
I requested for them to be sent back. Our server said they would re fire them not problem as this was their house specialty. Within 1 minute they were returned. How are new lamb chops re-fired and brought back within 1 minute? There were two lamb chops that were returned to us and tasted the EXACT same. Did they just scrape the top off? I was disguised. 

The same goes for the octopus. It was SO over the top over seasoned that it was just painful trying to eat it. I've been to countless greek restaurants and travelled greece for months and the food is no where this over seasoned. 

I am not only appalled by this restaurant but coming from years of working in the hospitality industry myself, I would never treat customers the way my server did. This whole dinning experience ruined a beautiful night we were suppose to have.

Disgusted."}
{"text":"In my view, there are 3 components to a successful restaurant meal:  the food, the decor/ambiance, and the service.  There are 10,000 restaurants in Toronto and if a place doesn't satisfy all three parts, then as far as I'm concerned, there are 9,999 restaurants left to try and I won't give a place a second chance.  Unfortunately Mamakas Taverna falls into that category.

Let's start with the good:  the food was quite good.  We started with a few dips, spanakopita and saganaki.  The saganaki was so delicious with a honey taste that we ordered a 2nd.  Cheese fries are not to be missed, flavoured with truffle oil.  Lamb chops were a little on the small side, and red snapper was both overcooked and overpriced at $55.

The place is loud but in a good way - lots of energy.

Now for the most important part:  the food was good enough for 3 stars however I rated Mamakas  as 1 star for their arrogance and rudeness.  I need to mention that our server was very friendly and polite.  If only she also worked the front of the restaurant as well....

Full disclosure:  we were approximately 10 minutes late for our 7:45 reservation.  We received a call in the car at 7:46 to confirm that we were still coming.  We mentioned that we were 5 minutes away and would be there shortly.  The hostess told us that she could only hold the table until 8:00 and we reassured her that we would be there before that time.  She then told us that at one minute after 8:00 our table would be gone.  Seriously?   Who chastises their customers like that?  We should have been tipped off as to what to expect at that point.  I might add that when we checked in at 7:55 we were told our table would be ready in a moment- they were just setting it.  When we were seated we were told that they have a strict policy of a two hour time limit for dining.

Our meal came out well paced, though the sides arrived well after we started the entrees and were removed from the bill.  At 10:01 the hostess came to our table to figuratively remind us that our \"meter had expired\", and that the group waiting for our table had been standing at the front for 15 minutes.  She said we were welcome to stay and finish our conversation at the bar, but we would have to vacate the table immediately.

This uncomfortable situation could easily have been avoided.  Most importantly they should let people know about their time limit when they make their reservation.  I just spoke with Carbon Bar to make a reservation and they told me they had a similar policy and I thanked them for letting me know and booked elsewhere.  Alternatively, if the hostess had offered to buy a round of drinks for our inconvenience it would have gone a long way.  But nothing but rudeness and arrogance.

Suffice it to say, there are now 9,999 restaurants in Toronto and I will NOT be going back to find out if they are any friendlier."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Wanted to go to another restaurant down the street but they were all booked up. Glad we found this restaurant. The grilled sea bass was wonderful and they took great care to debone it for you before serving. Also really liked the pomegranate and almond side dish, the Halloumi, and the sea urchin. Grilled lamb was nothing special but decent. The white chocolate yogurt dessert was a great ending to the meal"}
{"text":"The place itself is very clean, modern but still very recognizably Greek feel to it.  

The staff were great and our waitress was exceptional. You don't say that too often in Toronto especially on a busy Saturday night dinner service. 
The food has been getting rave reviews and while everything we tried was good to very good I would not classify anything as over the top. There is one exception. The dandelion greens were better than even my mamas. 

As a group of 4 we decided we would each order a appetizer and main each along with the village salad and two sides to share between us.  

Appetizers:
Bread & olive oil - meh!  This should be offered complimentary. 
Taramasalata - silky, creamy good. 
Smelts - grilled nicely. 
Croquettes - not traditional at all but a really nice Greek twist served with red pepper sauce. Could have/should have ordered a 2nd order. 

Mains:
Grilled fish - tasty and cooked well but nothing over the top. 
Octopus - grilled well but served with a bean purée that was gritty almost chalky. 
Pork - very nicely cooked. The mustard seeds added a nice pop of flavour. 
Lamb - yum. One of the few thing I wanted more of. 

Side:
Greens - as previously mention they were exceptional. I didn't want to share.
Village salad - meh!  It's tomatoes with feta. Maybe I'm spoiled having fresh tomatoes from my mothers garden all summer. 
Potatoes - they're French fries with feta. Meh! 

Desserts:
Baklava - don't bother. I found it very dry and overly stuffed with nuts. The vanilla honey ice cream was great. 
Pear cake - yum!  Could have had a second. 

Price - is moderate. Dinner for 4 with drinks came out to $200. That's pretty average for a nice night out. 

Overall this is a very nice place to go for non traditional Greek food. I don't even like calling it Greek food. It's good Mediterranean food. It's not the stereotypical \"fast food\" you find on the Danforth loaded with rice and potatoes."}
{"text":"Easily the best meal I've had in Toronto. 

Went with a group of 3 to celebrate my birthday and was totally blown away by the freshness and quality of the food. I am Greek so am very familiar with the cuisine and highly recommend dining at this restaurant. 

The decor is lovely, the service attentive and helpful, the menu varied and enticing. 

We started with the tzatziki, melitzanosalata, halloumi, and fried smelts. Each dish was perfectly seasoned and the freshness and quality of the smelts was outstanding. 

For the main course, we shared the fish of the day (beautifully fresh grilled sea bream), the squash fondue, and the beef cheek stifado. 

Put simply, this restaurant showcases the best of Greek cuisine: fresh, high quality ingredients seasoned simply to highlight their natural taste. It's a pricy meal but well worth it. 

I can't understand the inconsistent reviews on Yelp- I can't recommend this place more highly."}
{"text":"Extraordinary staff, a gorgeous venue, and some of the best hummus I've ever had in my life makes this an amazing venue. The spanakopita is to die for, too. Great place for a date, but make sure you plan in advance, as this place is super busy."}
{"text":"Don't look for a big sign with the words Mamakas Taverna, all you will see is a glass door with blue Greek lettering on it. If you see a pile of pitas through the glass front, you are at the right place.

We hopscotched around the menu with our knowledgeable server as our guide. Starting with the Taramosalata, a caviar and potato whipped mousse with hot pita bread. The Taramosalata I've had in the past have been too fishy, but this one is nicely balances with plenty of lemon so it's bright and almost light. The pita bread is divine, it comes piping hot, charred on the outside but so soft inside. Something simple but done correctly made the whole meal for me.

The Xifias was next, a thin slice of cured swordfish liberally doused with lemon and dill. The dish is refreshing but isn't too substantial and quickly leaves you wanting more. The grilled octopus consists of two long tentacles charred at the tips but tender in the thicker parts. By this time we were craving more of the pita, so ordered the Melitzanosalata which was good but who were we kidding.....we were really after the pita. The last dish of the meal was the lamb chops as recommended by our patient waiter after observing our sporadic navigation of the menu. It wrapped up the meal perfectly, four lamb chops cooked to a rare and beautifully tender.  The meal was like a quick vacation to the Greek Islands for the night, definitely worth the trip!!"}
{"text":"I don't like writing bad reviews so I will leave a quick summary: dirty fork, sold out appetizer and for dessert, their ice cream machine was broken so that limited the choices. Overall, not impressed."}
{"text":"Great experience, great food and ambiance. Food is light, great tasting and flavourful.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Excellent! Had the great fortune to sit at the chef's table and watch the culinary genius of Chef Chris Kalisperas. Our table of 5 tasted more than half of the menu:  starting with the flavourful dips like you've never had before, fresh in-house warm pita bread, succulent octopus, exquisite quail, Greek cheese served at the perfect temperature, lamb chops that were so meaty and seasoned just right, unique goat tartare, to lamb sausage with skordalia (like mashed potatoes but puréed with garlic and oil).  Even the village salad which was simple marinated tomatoes with fresh feta was fantastic. Chef Kalisperas knows the trick of using top quality ingredients in interesting combinations and allowing the flavours to tantalize your tastebuds. Gather a few friends and enjoy an evening dining experience extraordinaire at Mamakas Taverna!"}
{"text":"Oh ma gaw. Just had one of the best meals I've ever had at Mamakas.

Full disclosure: I didn't pay for anything/don't even know how much our meal cost, so this review is strictly about food and service... Which were so flawless that Beyonce would have to change her song to \"Somewhat Flawed, Actually.\"

Our server recommended the Fix Hellas for me, as I like lighter beers, and it was perfect. My family raved about their cocktails.

My family and I had a six?-course prix fixe meal:

1. Pita + four dips
2. Cured swordfish + spanakopita
3. Tomato/feta/cucumber salad
4. Grilled lambchops with couscous salad + garlic fries
5. Grilled octopus over a fava bean sauce
6. Baklava + ice cream

The lamb was so goddamn juicy and delicious. The tomato/feta/cucumber salad was another favourite. There was enough food to feed a TDSB classroom, but we managed to finish most of it.

Service was really good... Our server was knowledgeable, charming, and generally on POINT. There was also what sounded like Greek house music playing in the restaurant, which made for good (but loud-ish) vibes. Walls are all white, giving it that Santorini feel.

So, so good though."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Definitely lives up to the hype. Service was attentive but not overbearing. The food was superb and unique (not what you get at every Greek resto). This place really sends Toronto into another realm in terms of culinary class. 

Best dish of the night was the whole grilled sea bass."}
{"text":"3.5 - Good but perhaps a bit over hyped for me as I came in with high expectations. Mamakas is physically a beautiful restaurant with relatively comfortable seating, bright lighting, spacious and lovely design features. Service was excellent as well. 

The food however I was disappointed. It was still good but definitely not as amazing as I expected. 

Dips: 4.5/5 - comes with 2 pitas must order!

Sword fish 4/5 - thin sliced, like prosciutto. Filled with flavours

Lamb chops - 3/5: where I expected more, nothing special. I feel like I would have been able to make this at home

Potatoes - 3.5/5: these were basically fries. Pretty good but nothing spectacular 

Wouldn't be a rush to come back but I'll give it another chance in the future to try other parts of the menu"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cute-charming casual and up beat.  I would not say it is elegant.  The open kitchen is in the front as soon as you walk in.  A long marble bar occupies the middle of the restaurant.  I am not fooled into thinking that the cheap cinder block walls painted white are similar to Greek stucco.  In my opinion, this is a great place for a first date since I saw a lot of first date couples there on a Friday night and there were no children.  Be aware that all the cocktails on the Cocktail Menu contain simple syrup, except for one which is Sherry based.  The Greek wine was fine.  We ordered three food items.  First, if you like cheese on your Tuna Tartare (I don't) then this is the place for you.  Their Greek touch is topping tuna tartare with Feta Cheese.  Next, we got the steamed Muscles.  They are grotesquely huge!!! They are so big that one must use a knife and fork to cut in half because one whole in your mouth is like size of a golf ball.  Try 8 cm long (or 3 inches long) and wide!! 
Finally, we ordered the octopus, $20.  It was just the one arm, just like every other restaurant does here in Toronto.  This arm was huge too!!  But it was tender sweet and without any fat.  Service was good and attentive.  With so many other restaurants in the city, I don't know if I would give it another try.  I did not walk away feeling excited."}
{"text":"After reading everyone's reviews on Yelp, it seemed to be a mixture of people thinking it was 'over hyped' or in my opinion it was described perfectly. It was about what I expected for pricing (maybe a little high on certain items but with a group you could sample a few bites of everything), the atmosphere and ambiance is great.

Everything we ordered was delicious and FULL of flavor. We started with the dip (I was disappointed there wasn't a 'try all' dip option because, i would've like to try all 3 and I heard great things about the tzaiki) but our server helped us narrow it down to her fav: the Melitzanosalata which neither of us never had ever tried before so we opted for that.  

The Melitzanosalata came out FAST, it was yummy (eggplant base w honey) but, those warm pita breads drizzled with olive oil and salt - I could've eaten two more and been satisfied. So, I would suggest trying a few if you're with a larger party. 

Horiatiki (Greek Salad) also came out quickly, it was in my opinion one of the best in the city but, I agree it was a pricey salad $18? 

The fried Brussels are a new addiction of mine, they were good. I've tried them at a few places in the city and they're always about the same.

The 'fish of the day' was the sea bass- cooked to perfection again drizzled in olive oil, capers and lemon. No sides with it so if you order a few things maybe try and leave a bit of pita or salad to eat with it cause it was a fairly large portion to just eat on its own at the end. 

 Our server was extremely knowledgeable, in my opinion you can tell a place that takes pride when their staff knows the food menu and the wine menu. Kudos to them and her!  All her recommendations were appreciated, although we didn't try the goat tartare, cause I'm never overly thrilled with goat. Maybe next time ;) 

It's a loud place perfect for a night out and to share some cocktails or a bottle of wine, out w a few friends or on a date, I wouldn't suggest more than 6 or you'd just get stuck talking to the person next to you lol."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing vibe. Knocking two stars off because of the disingenuous / horrible service. The host gave me attitude for being seven minutes late. I told her I tried calling 3x to inform them I was running late and she said, oh the phones get so busy so we can't even answer it. Your guests pay you to keep your job. Get it right."}
{"text":"I was looking for Greek food but didn't want all the kitsch of Danforth Ave. I stumbled upon a review of this place and was hooked as soon as I saw the menu. 
The restaurant decor is clean, warm, and modern with subtle hints of the Mediterranean. 

 The food was outstanding. The fresh baked bread covered  in fresh and dried herbs, drizzled with olive oil were amazing fresh out of the oven. Fried smelts were salty, crunchy, addictive. Couldn't stop eating them. We also had the lamb, octopus, braised rabbit, and squash fondue. All delicious but the lamb was my favorite. Baklava dessert was kind of a miss. The phyllo had gotten soggy but the milk and honey ice cream was spot on. 

I would definitely come back here again if I am back in Toronto."}
{"text":"Food was great and ample. All 3 sides (fries, dandelion salad, red peppers) were amazing.  Service was good and we were seated right away on a Sunday night without reservations, but did get the sense we'd lucked out since it was soon packed thereafter. Ambience is great with cool white decor and good energy. Definitely a place for eating with friends. As locals we're happy to see this addition to the Ossington strip."}
{"text":"This is probably my new favourite restaurant in Toronto. The sea bass and lamb are unreal. This would be an amazing date spot too!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a handful of times and it's delicious every time! The house made dips are very good along with their pita. I would recommend ordering a few different starters and entrees to share family style. The lamb and chicken are a very good portion sizes and very tasty. The octopus is also good but a little on the lighter side in terms of portions. The fries are a must side dish as the mains don't come with any sides. 
I would definitely come back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Easily one my my favourite restaurants in Toronto.

Not only does Mamakas serve upscale flavourful greek dishes, they match it with a bustling and energetic environment.  Mamakas executed simple dishes with flair and finesse.  The simplistic spanokopita was brought alive with sweetness from the glazed honey which complemented perfectly with the acidity from the underlying yogurt spread. The lamb chops were possibly the best lamb chops that I've had. The spread of tzatziki underneath the lamb chops was so good that it could probably be a dish on its own!

I would definitely come back once, twice, and possibly many more times for the spanokopita and the lamb chops!"}
{"text":"Go on a Thursday night as they let you sit longer. Sit at the bar if you are two. Ask for Vince. Have the whipped fish for appetizer, Greek salad and the catch of the day. Prepared to be wowed. Great service, fantastic atmosphere.  

I travel a lot. Great food and excellent service is hard to find. They nailed it."}
{"text":"Like the decor and cool vibe but have to say I don't mind paying $30 for fresh catch of the day.. But the cod was anything but fresh .
The spinach pastry apps were actually awesome as was the service. 
My dinner mate had his dish comped given kitchen admission that marinade was off.
Not sure I'll give it another go.. I like the food diversity avail on the strip and nice to have the Greek option but ultimately felt like an overpriced offering . The food Definately feel short !"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Got our meal very quickly. The lamb chops are to die for. Octopus was good as well! The energy and the chefs are amazing! We loved the decor and music. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Proper greek food. Proper service. Wine list is just awesome - all greek wines which I never ever get. But the server was able to guide me to a very 'pinot noir'-esque recommendation that was perfect. Get lots of pita... tons of opportunities to dip in just about any dish you get. Ill be back!"}
{"text":"Go with a group of 6 and order as much as you can. Everything is so flavourful and the service was stand out. Our server gave us recommendations on how much to order to ensure we are full and get the true experience. Not your typical Greek restaurant...and that is a good thing. The decor is clear and makes you feel at home all at the same time. I loved the octopus."}
{"text":"A trendy, signature Ossington vibe with a Mediterranean twist. The open-kitchen concept is something that I've come to truly appreciate. The food was a nice balance between contemporary flair with traditional Greek twists. The menu boats quite a few Greek classics and a few \"Greek-fusion\" selections. We opted to start with the lamb tartare and the fried smelts. The lamb was very fresh and tender, with a rich yogurt-based garlic sauce, lemon, onion and celery. It was delicious but the flavour of the meat was a little lost in all the seasoning. It was also uncharacteristically spicy. The smelts were delicious, fresh and crisp, a dish that really brought back memories from the Aegean. Our mains were the grilled octopus and the Ontario lamb chops. The grilled octopus was flavourful, tender and perfectly cooked. This tends to be a difficult dish to execute, it's easy to overcook which results in a rubbery texture. The lamb was also spot-on, tender and juicy. It was presented beautifully and was served with a well-balanced in-house tzatziki sauce. We also ordered a side of dandelion and spinach sautéed with garlic, olive oil and rhubarb - very tasty. Overall I was very happy with my experience at Mamakas. Don't expect a traditional Greek taverna with old-school dishes and huge portions, but a modern Greek-inspired menu that's using some interesting local ingredients."}
{"text":"Brilliant, sophisticated, classy, and ambient is the best way I can describe this Greek gem at Ossington and Queen.

We ordered Melitzanosalata, from their 4 delicious dips at $7.00 each. It was the most delicious melody of authentic Olive oil and strawberry and honey flavoured thick Greek yogurt which came with a side of the thickest garnished lightly oiled pita bread. We also ordered an appetizer called Halloumi (goat/sheep cheese) infused with corn, Peaches, and Pistachios. It was extremely unique and delicious.

For our entrée we ordered half chicken and grilled calamari. Chicken was nicely crispy and grilled and came infused with thick Greek yogurt and mango chutney. Grilled calamari was also infused in a gourmet sauce.

As I was enjoying my decadent meal I was having hard time believing I was eating Greek food. This place is as authentic, delicious, and gourmet as it gets. And the prices are not that steep which makes it even more attractive. I didn't order dessert this time but will definitely be back for their pear cake and baklava which was being served behind me with a scoop of rich vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and friendly staff. I would advise coming here with a group of friends so can try most of the items on the menu. We had the chicken, octopus, saganaki (surprisingly small given the price), veal sweetbread, a salad as a side and baklava (which was my favourite item on the menu)."}
{"text":"Amazing staff. Great vibe. Declicious food. I've been twice. It's a great addition to the Ossington strip."}
{"text":"It would have been a perfect experience if we got better value for the price. 

Mamakas serves up delicious Greek food in the hip Ossington neighbourhood. Although the decor is trendy and appealing, the entrance and spacing between tables were a bit tight specially on busy nights. 

Our group ordered the cheese sgnaski, goat tartare and smelt to start, all were quite tasty. For the main, I had the lamb chops, the Mr. had the grilled calamari and my friend ordered the Moussaka. Truth be told, I didn't think the price justified the small portions served even tho the food were delicious. For example, the calamari cost $21 but it only came in 2 tiny tentacles, I was served 4 small pieces of lamb chops for $36 while my friend's moussaka was barely big enough for everyone to take a bite. On top of that, none of the entrees came with sides so we had to order side dishes.  A side order of broccolini costed $6 and came with 2 stems while the tomato feta cheese salad cost $18! 

Delicious food but not at that price."}
{"text":"The April instalment of ladies' dinner brought us to Mamakas, a new and lively place on the Ossington strip.

Luckily we made reservations for a Wednesday night as the place was pretty packed when we arrived around 6:30pm. 

Our group ordered taramasalata dip, warm olives, salmon tartar and saganaki appetizers to start.  Followed by the Marouli salad and larger chicken and octopus dishes plus a side of the fresh frites.  Drinks were a round of red/white wine, cocktails and I decided to go with a Volkan Blonde beer.

Appetizers were delivered first...the taramasalata dip was lovely.  Salmon tartar was average with the saganaki being a bit limp and unexciting without being set aflame in front of us.  The bigger dishes were great - chicken was perfectly cooked and octopus was meaty and big enough to share four ways with a bit of leftovers to spare.  Marouli salad was light, refreshing and rounded out the meal.

Too stuffed for dessert, we hit the road with bellies full.  Bill was roughly $50/person including tax and tip for our party of four.  

Definitely a nice change from traditional Greek places on the Danforth and food was given the ethnic stamp of approval by our Greek friend."}
{"text":"I don't have much experience with Greek cuisine outside of fast food like souvlaki and gyros, so I decided to go with the modern-Greek route for an introduction. 

Mamakas is on the hipster Ossington strip, where creativity is never lacking. The menu at Mamakas appeared to consist of dishes using a Greek foundation, then altered with up-to-date cooking techniques and seasonal local ingredients. 

I started off with what the owner highly recommended, the xifias, to contrast the rich flavors of the meaty main dishes. The xifias is unlike most of the appetizers, in that it's a cold dish, consisting of thin swordfish sashimi sprinkled with fennel, dill, radish, chili, and a few pieces of sea asparagus. The fish was sheet-thin but still had a meaty flesh, it tasted generally mild but easily soaked up the bright lemon sauce and herbally dill. I have heard of a Greek swordfish steak before, but never seen swordfish served the way Mamakas hprepared it. This truly demonstrates the theme of Mamakas reinventing dishes using the Greek recipe core and local vegetables.

For the main course, I ordered the rabbit stifado. This dish was the reason I came to Mamakas, after seeing it highlighted in a travel magazine that I read at my hotel. The stifado not quite served as a stew in a pot as you might imagine, the Mamakas version is an individual portion and served on big plate. It contained a succulent rabbit leg braised in wine, sweet chopped vegetables, and peppercorns, then placed over a creamy puree of artichokes. The rabbit meat was accompanied with roasted onions, which had the best caramelized flavor I had ever experienced. 

Service was exceptional from the moment I stepped through the door. The owner was genuine, energetic, and friendly, he definitely knows hospitality and how to entertain guests.

The prices were somewhat higher than expected, but justified due to the use of local fresh ingredients in a very unique and creative way. After a great meal at Mamakas, I definitely want to return the next time I'm in town, and also try a traditional Greek restaurant on Danforth to see the difference."}
{"text":"Great modern take on greek cuisine. I got to try on a lot of different dishes and the lamb and halloumi were probably my favs. The tomatoes and feta salad was amazing as well! I am not a huge fan of greek salads but this was so delicious with top-notch olive oil. The ambience is a very nice as well. It is a bit pricy but I'd definitely go back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"This was our favorite dining experience of all we enjoyed on a recent trip to Toronto. Atmosphere, A+. Food and drink, all A+. We were a party of four who ordered several appetizers and entrees for sharing and cocktails as well as desserts. All A++. Our server, Cara, made the entire dining experience fantastic. While she admitted she has served here only four months, we couldn't tell; she was extremely knowledgeable and helpful about the menu, as well as an excellent server. We spent two and a half hours here on a Saturday evening; the place was packed with patrons and more waiting to come in. We all agreed Mamakas is on our favorite list. We will certainly return!"}
{"text":"Wow from start to finish! This food was INCREDIBLE! Honestly, the roasted chicken may have been some of the juiciest well flavored chicken I've ever had. Usually chicken can be a safe dish that doesn't always standout next to the likes of lamb, beef or whole roasted fish, but this dish came to play! It was scrumptious. The wines are all from Greece and the server helped us pick a lovely bottle based on what I usually go for with wine. The spanikopita was not that run of mill kind, it was a full blown artsy pastry made with so much care and technique. The meze style dips were well flavored. Definite shout outs to the eggplant and roasted red pepper ones. Those really stood out. And OMFG the pita bread that's made in house is a carb lovers dream! Holy moly this was unreal! Honestly it was a superb meal and I would love to dine here again!"}
{"text":"My initial assumption about this place is that the food was going to be fancier souvalaki-like dishes drenched in tzatziki sauce. Boy am I wrong. This place really sets themselves apart from the flavours and nice sophisticated ambiance without the uptight feel. This is Family-style so you can share the dishes and try a bit of each. The waitress is knowledgeable but I felt like we were a little rushed to get out as they cleared the plates when there was still a little bit of food left. 

The must try: 
Paidakia (lambchops) and halloumi (appetizer with corn peaches pistachio and cheese). The house dips are are also good. I like the eggplant based and also the spicy dip one.

Not as good:
Chicken was a little on the dry side. 
Fish was just steamed fish not that special 
Octopus has an interesting sauce, good to try but it wasn't cooked that perfectly."}
{"text":"A great place to enjoy a selection of greek food. The small, flavourful dishes are great to share and the atmosphere is lively. 

My girlfriend and I shared 4 appetizer dishes and it was plenty. The spanakopita was fluffy, tangy and the added thyme finished it really well. The eggplant dish had amazing combination of flavours; dill, oregano and fried onions somehow all worked together. The lamb pitas were perfectly cooked with the lamb juices still coming out when biting into the pita which is sized to easily fit in your hand without making it awkward.

The service was really great. We aren't very adept to Greek dishes so the server was able to steer us in the right direction. 

The only concern with the restaurant overall is price. But when you add the positives of the restaurant you know what you're paying for."}
{"text":"Really, I don't even know why I am reviewing this place because it has been written up so often! I'm not sure you really need my opinion, but I have a tradition of giving it anyway. The short answer is yes. Yes, the service is great. Yes, the ambiance is great. Yes, the food is absolutely amazing! I've been a few times now and it never fails to disappoint. The plates are a testament to what care and simple ingredients can produce. The only real risk is having your eyes be bigger than your stomach when ordering! Enjoy."}
{"text":"Good experience. Solid food and service. I  walked in late in the evening and I was seated within 5 minutes. The wait staff knew the food that they were selling/serving. The food were solid 3.5 stars. In totality of ambiance, the customers, food, and service, this place is a 4 Stars material."}
{"text":"Greek restaurants are one of my favourites. 
This place does a great disservice to that love.
Good food in dismal  portions. Bad service in large servings !!"}
{"text":"Great food.  I am usually the carnivore out of the group,  but decided to try most of the vege options and truly enjoyed them. Service by James and the kitchen staff was quite welcoming and hospitable."}
{"text":"Opa! 

I've been scheming a nice new restaurant to try for a special occasion, and Mamakas was at the top of my list. I've never come across high-end Greek food in Toronto, so I was pretty excited. I love Greek food, I love fancy things, win win. 

The restaurant itself is sparkling white with bright murals and large windows for Ossington people watching, one of my favourite sports. While sitting in this bustling yet pristine setting, we enjoyed their tequila negroni, the tzaziki and pita, the spanikopita, the lamb and the octopus. It was all delicious, especially the tzaziki and lamb. The octopus is huge and means business, so if you're like Neil Patrick Harris* and are into octopus and scrabble, this is probably your dish. The owner sent over a small bottle of ouzo, which really added a kick to our night, and was very appreciated. 

PEPPER'S PISSED: Huh. Haven't been pissed in a while, but I need to sound off. What is with this new airplane-sized bathroom trend, Tarana? I'd rather wait for a couple of minutes than be squished into a 2x2 room that houses a sink, toilet, mirror and garbage. 

*I just saw Gone Girl."}
{"text":"This place, along with Estiatorio Volos, are jointly carrying the Greek cuisine crowns in Toronto. 

Unlike Volos, Mamakas is pleasantly more casual, which is why it's great for a meal with your significant other or with a small group of friends, too.

The menu is delicious on the whole. Keeping it honest, I'm less crazy about their brunch. The brunch was perfectly fine, but had brunch been my only experience at Mamakas, I wouldn't be excitedly hurrying back. With that said, dinner is fantastic, and they have some interesting and tasty cocktails, too. Their food is authentic enough for a taste of Greece, but also slightly modernized for some unique flavors, too.

The servers are friendly and great, too. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food ****1/2
Service ***
Ambience ****

These folks have it going on!  I've walked past here a hundred times and thought it was a cafe.  I'm glad I found this spot.  

As we were a larger group, we ordered a number of dishes including lamb, chicken, Greek salad, Octopus, Greek Salad and a few others.  

The standouts were the Greek salad and (surprisingly) the chicken.  Both were exceptional. The Greek salad olives (paste) were so flavourful - I'm glad some folks at the table didn't like olives and I got to go to town on it!

The group and 3 bottles of wine and a few cocktails.   Bill came to under $100 including an t&t (18% grat), which was reasonable in my opinion for that much food and a good helping of alcohol.   Service was good at the start, however towards the end when I finished my drink and was looking to get another, our server was nowhere to be found."}
