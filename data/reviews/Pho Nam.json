{"text":"Refreshing and enjoyable in every way. Reasonably priced, rapidly served, fresh and delicious ingredients. My first time here, I enjoyed the pho tai."}
{"text":"I have ate Vietnamese for a long time. Start simple with a rare beef pho (soup)...don't worry beef cooks in the soup when it is served to you. After a few visits then graduate to a vermicelli bowl or some fried quail. After that your horizons will be expanded and you may now venture into new taste relms you have never experienced. These guys cook bc they love making people happy, not because it is a business. If you think Applebee's is anything above one star please stay where you are and keep thinking Asian food is fried doughnut chicken. Ohh.. and if you get stuck eating pho for two years before you venture out don't worry I did the same thing...it's damn good!"}
{"text":"Was pleased to discover pho in Cornelius, and this place did not disappoint. I got the vegetarian pho, and it was delicious. The service was phenomenal, and the food was good. My husband got the house chicken, and he really enjoyed it. The decor is simple, and the prices are very good for dinner."}
{"text":"Coming from Dallas we have lots of great Vietnams restaurants so finding a good one close by was an absolute must, and we most def lucked out with this one. Pho Nam has great food and you can feel the love that goes into the food. The protions are also right for the price. My favorite part the owner is a Feeder, meaning he lives to feed people."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for me on the way home from work when I get a craving for noodles. The rare beef pho really hits the spot and the vermicelli with pork, shrimp and crispy fried rolls is also a solid choice. Unfortunately, the summer rolls aren't great and I've yet to try the banh xeo. But these guys get 5 stars for the noodle dishes and their fantastic, friendly service!"}
{"text":"Delicious pho here - broth is spot on, good portion size and lots of meat. We had the beef ball pho, triple meat pho and Korean rib plate which comes with rice, small salad and a bowl of pho broth. Service is excellent and fast."}
{"text":"I like to review a restaurant after going several times. It helps to get an average  This place is anything but average. The food is consistently out of sight.   Highly recommend.  Fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Nothing better than an owner and chef that takes real pride in their food. The beef broth he makes is amazing. The prices are good as well.   The ambiance is not the best, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Calling all vegans and others with dietary restrictions! The owner is an absolute dear and will make any food to your specifications. This is one of my family's favorite restaurants. The owner made me a vegetable soup which was delightful. For my lunch today I ended up getting spicy vegetables and tofu. The sauce itself wasn't very spicy, but the chili peppers in it perked it right up."}
{"text":"Set aside the cosmetic flaws of any hole in the wall place, these guys make some awesome Pho. The beef broth wasn't as heavy and artificially flavored as I've had at different Vietnamese joints. We drove thirty minutes to slurp some and we'd defiantly do it again! The owner delivered our dishes and was very tentative. He even gave us a drink on the way out!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"There isn't a lot to the restaurant, it's a pretty small hole in the wall.  They just recently got new tables so it looks a lot nicer than it did with the cheap metal and plastic ones before.  The Pho is pretty good, about the same as most other places.   One of the best things is that the food always comes out quick!"}
{"text":"As far as I know, this is the only Vietnamese restaurant in the area. The pho here is good. Broth is a little on the salty side. The rice dishes are lacking. They do not have broken rice, which is a staple of Vietnamese rice dishes. They are simple but do not offer the option to add side items like the egg and meat cake. This place will satisfy your craving when you have one. The service is great and owner is willing to make things for you that arent on the menu."}
{"text":"we have been going to Pho Nam for 7 years.  John the owner/chef knows everyone by first name.  If you want more of this or less of that he accommodates.    We try and go at least once a week.  Good people, good food....support a local establishment."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting my parents in North Carolina when we were craving one of our favorite foods, pho.  I wasn't expecting much of what we were used to in Los Angeles but it was actually very similar quality! I know what you're thinking, it's hard to go wrong with noodle soup, but I've had bad pho before.  We started out with crispy quail which was a whole quartered quail, basted and fried with no batter and served with a salt and pepper lemon juice sauce.  Then I got #29 the special meat combo pho with rare and well Cooked steak, tendon, tripe and meatball.  It didn't seem to be as flavorful as the pho in LA, but all together a simple flavor of one of our favorite comfort foods!  Great service, the staff is from San Francisco, minimal decor, indoor seating, take out, and air conditioning."}
{"text":"After finding out our regular pho place was closed on Sunday. My boyfriend and I decided to branch out and give somewhere else a try. We found  pho nam read the reviews and decided to try it. We live 16 miles away, I went to pick the food up, briefly glanced in the bag to make sure all was there. It seemed to be so I went home. When I took everything out of the bag we then  realized both orders were wrong. My boyfriend was charged for the seafood pho, but got the meatballs? I ordered the well done beef pho and I got meatballs an rare beef instead. Even though we were charged for the most expensive things and received the cheapest, we decided to still try it. Having high hopes an really craving pho. To our dismay the broth was not that great. It was ok. Tasted stale almost. We also ordered extra noodles and didn't receive both orders. If your really craving pho I would not suggest this place. I'd definitely wait until my regular spot is open and have a burger night or something."}
{"text":"Great authentic Vietnamese food, really nice people.  Great value for price.  Not much ambiance, but their investment is in the food.  Great for takeaway as well!"}
{"text":"Simple & Delicious.   This is definitely a family establishment operated by a family who pours their hearts  into being Lake Norman's go to place for Pho and Vietnamese cuisine.    If you want your food made a certain way, just ask and they'll take care of you.  No doubt you'll find something on the menu for everyone at your table."}
{"text":"My wife and I just moved to the area and we were looking for some lunch, preferably Vietnamese, so based on some reviews we decided to try Pho Nam. As other reviewers have stated it is definitely a hole in the wall type place, but my dining experience has led me to believe often these places can be the best...and this was no exception! We started with the Banh Xeo and to say it was flavorful and tasty is an understatement! I got Pho Tai while my wife got the Bun Tom Thit Noung Cha Gio and everything was simply marvelous. Add all of the basil, carrots, sprouts and sauces and it was even (if possible) more delicious! I was a little under the weather and the broth cleared me up, maybe some magical cures here, lol. Seriously, wonderful food, an owner who certainly cares about his guests and all for a more than reasonable price, what more can you ask for!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time coming here and I loved it! The owners and staff are very friendly. I got the beef pho and the egg rolls. The egg rolls were cheap and were very good for the price. The beef pho was also very good for the price and I can say you will get your money's worth. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love their Pho!! The guy at the counter is always, always nice and once in a while one of the older gentlemen pops his head out the back with a smile. Great comfort food for me."}
{"text":"I've had pho at other restaurants across the country and this is the best I've had. The owner and employees are passionate about their food and very friendly. I had the pho rare beef and it was outstanding! Prices are very reasonable. I would recommend this place to anyone. Take out or an inexpensive dinner date."}
{"text":"What a nice Staff!!! Pho Nam is well.....Pho Nam-inal (Look someone had to do it!) We really enjoyed the summer roll and the pork claypot. The only thing missing was the drinks with the boba balls that I loooooove! Again the food was really good but the people are absolutely delightful!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Pho. The ingredients are so fresh and the broth is piping hot with incredible flavor. This is my go-to for days I'm craving soup or days when soup will help solve a simple cold. Also, the owners are the sweetest folks. Our family loves this gem where you can have the best Pho around! In fact, we'll be there today for lunch when they open! 5 stars Pho sure! :)"}
{"text":"Just okay.  Nothing special about this place other then it's the only pho spot for miles.  Soup is bland."}
{"text":"My favorite food is Viet. This restaurant left much to be desired. The water tasted like well water. The pho tai was bland. The spring roll (cha gio) is indescribable as was the fish sauce (nuoc nam)."}
{"text":"What a treat to find a great Vietnamese restaurant in Salisbury.  While on vacation there, we tried a lot of places in town, and this was the best restaurant there.  This was the only one we visited multiple times.  They were prompt, friendly, and the food was fresh and very tasty.  We were welcomed as friends the second time we entered.  What a lovely experience!"}
{"text":"Great small very clean family owned establishment.  Good variety of food and owner the chef and son the server.  Food uses fresh ingregiants, is excellent tasting and very consistent.  Try to eat there every week.  Give it a look and try #21.  Had the curried vegetables and vermicelli today."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in the area!  Pho and many other amazing menu items.  Super nice family that owns it great to see them every time we dine in!"}
{"text":"This is the best pho we have had since moving to NC.  Best value as well with the amount of meat and toppings higher than any we have found here.  The toppings were very fresh and the broth was obviously cooked for many hours.  The meat in the pho tai was very tender and paper thin, as it should be.  Service was excellent, very friendly folks and the soup came out quickly and water glasses were kept filled.  I was surprised the place had been around quite a few years as it could have passed for new, including the bathrooms.  Cute location, and outdoor seating is available.  We were visiting in Charlotte and drove up to Lake Norman to enjoy this place and the lake and we will definitely make the same side trip the next time we are in the area.  We were craving pho but will be sure to try the other menu items next time.  Probably with some pho to go."}
{"text":"Spring rolls were great.  Pho broth was thin but overall was okay. Pho condiments were provided when asked for instead of available on the tables.  Papaya salad dressing was flavorless and their garnish choice was odd.  Lemongrass chicken was disappointing because I tasted no Lemongrass. None. It was all sweet peanut (tasty) sauce. The fish sauce dressing for the raw veggies was rancid smelling and tasted like dirty gym socks. For our next pho trip we will go to Charlotte and deal with the traffic on I77 instead of returning."}
{"text":"Great service extremely friendly and very helpful. Our waitress helped one of our party figure out something great to eat that she loved, even though she was scared to order it at first. They are very accommodating and even offer choices not on the menu based on what you say you may like. The food was very fresh tasting and just good all around. The decor could really use some help it has the feel of a take out joint with a couple of tables thrown in as an afterthought. We will go there again, this may become a favorite spot."}
{"text":"Pho Nam is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants I've ever been to.  I had numerous items on the menu, and everything was divine.  The service was fabulous.  Such a quaint and friendly family restaurant with top notch food.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This little tucked-away restaurant is wonderful!  We tried lots of dishes and were thrilled with them all.  The food is perfect - in taste, seasoning, and presentation.  The service is also excellent, and the entire atmosphere is very welcoming.  I can't wait to go back - and I'm proud to give them my highest recommendation.  I don't think you can go wrong here!!   As an earlier reviewer said, the restaurant is unassuming, but fantastic - and well worth your time to visit.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's got a hole-in-the-wall look to it and you can tell it's family-run, which makes you feel like you've found a hidden gem. No decor to speak of but the food is so good you won't mind; you can also get your food to-go. There is a sweet old man behind the counter who always offers me a free can of soda :) The garnishes are all very fresh and the portions are HUGE! For  about 7 or 8 bucks! :D I love picking up a bowl for dinner. It's always more than I can eat.  I only ever get the pho (beef, of course) but my mom went there with me once and had some sort of basil fried rice dish. I had the leftovers and they were delicious-- a TON of very fresh basil. Please, eat here and give them some well-deserved business!  PS-- Some reviews are saying the broth is not flavored enough. I always figured that was so you can adjust the flavor, with the 5,000 condiments they give you, to your exact liking. Experiment with it!"}
{"text":"YUMMY, COZY, FRESH, and FAMILY OWNED.   I had driven with my guy all the way from Tennessee, before pulling in. I needed something cozy and warm to make my soul feel good.  I started by ordering a couple of Tofu Spring Rolls, which were so fresh. I saw them roll them as soon as I ordered them. The tofu inside was fresh and hot, while the veggies were cool and fresh. So amazing. TIP: add sriracha to the peanut sauce ;)  I then ordered the Beef & Lemongrass Vermicelli (I believe, #12) and OH MY GOODNESS. They brought out some chili oil on the side, which I added. It was so yummy and so fresh. The meet was seasoned to perfection. My boyfriend wouldn't stop stealing from my plate. It was so delicious, and I recommend stirring it all up before digging in.   My boyfriend ordered the PHO TAI, which was soo yummy. It would be the perfect soup for a sick, or rainy day. The beef inside the soup was so tender and flavorful.   It was so nice to see our food made to order, by this very friendly older man. He ended up offering us some free soda, as we left! So nice, and a great vibe.  It was a delightful experience, and I will be back. It's simple and delicious. Plus, it's pretty cheap too. ;)"}
{"text":"Just love this place. They are so friendly and are willing to prepare your food however you like it! Food is delicious and reasonable!!!"}
{"text":"Pho is delicious!  I've also tried the grilled pork chop dish, spring roll vermicelli noodles, and spicy tofu.  All delicious.  Basil fried rice is on point too!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, attentive service.  We wandered in without having been here before just because we were nearby.  I ordered the stir fried vegetables and tofu and my friend the pho and we both enjoyed our meals.  We both agreed we would definitely come to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I had the best vegetarian pho I've had in a long time. Filled with flavor and taste, and so fresh and clean. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"The Pho Ga was so so. The broth tasted like it was made with chicken boujion. The fried rolls where more like bite size popers. It did the job... but I have had better."}
{"text":"The food was good. Service was also excellent. I did feel like my food was a bit bland and didn't have much seasoning. This was my first experience eating Vietnamese food and definitely will be trying this place again. My boyfriend loves this type of food and found his rare marinated beef to be excellent. Small place, clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"It was delicious. I had the house special chicken and tasted the Chicken Pho Nam - awesome flavor and wonderful service."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant, highly suggest you check it out. Family owned and operated, super nice people with great service!  I only wish I would've started eating at this place sooner!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome...I spent 17 years in CA and this is the real deal Pho.  They are from Sunnyvale, CA and know Pho inside and out.  It is my go to place and I never get enough.  The service is wonderful and the owner, brother and son make the experience even better.   I have introduced all my friends to Pho Nam and they are all repeat customers.  Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out from this place. The cashier allowed me a free drink while I was waiting on my food, which was very kind. I ordered rare beef pho and it was so fresh and aromatic! I love how thin they shaved the beef too. This place is legit."}
{"text":"Fantastic homemade Vietnamese. The omelette appetizer and #11 vermicelli salad are my favorites."}
{"text":"Ok. Considering the location and the place, it definitely needs some work. Is the atmosphere important? Maybe and maybe not? How so?  For me, what is important is cleanliness. A place can look a little run down but still be clean. As for us, it was not clean per our experience. Yes, it is family owned but that is no excuse for the place not being clean. We ordered hot green tea, and the kettle was dirty with some type of sticky brown sauce on it as if it was just rinsed from an earlier customer and new green tea leaves and hot water was just added. We tried to ignore it and just went with the flow. We saw younger man who spoke English and was taking orders in dirty jeans and a collared shirt. He didn't look too clean. If you have a clean appearance (not saying he has to wear a uniform) then it really helps to portray your restaurant is clean as well. He definitely needs to work on his appearance. I saw him cleaning another table and it was very sloppy as if all that mattered was the big dirty stuff were off table and who cares if there are still some crumbs. I didn't like it.   My husband ordered pho Dac Biet for $8.95 which was lean and delicious. Maybe the soup was a little bland but I loved it wasn't greasy and yes, you can add flavor although truth is yummy pho needs no real sauce additions except for maybe more spiciness with jalapeños or sriracha. I ordered vermicelli with sliced pork and spring roll for $9.95. When MY food was brought out, an older man from the back came with the bowl and the dipping sauce with a soup spoon in it. His hands were dirty I am sure from the grill so my bowl had black char marks on it. Again, I sucked it up because of the many wonderful yelp reviews and said to myself, the food is supposed to be good so just let me ignore it. I was quite happy that the pork was well marinated and delicious. We also ordered the fresh summer roll appetizer and while the spring roll was delicious, the dipping sauce was too watered down and not good.   Overall, although we went in during rush hour of 12-1 pm when many were on lunch break, and considering the family there were in a rush. I will not come here again. Although the food was delicious aside from the spring roll dipping sauce, the lack of cleanliness for the price we pay just was not worth it because I would be too paranoid to get sick. I saw older gentlemen from kitchen serving guests and his hands had cilantro or onions or herbs on them as he brought out the soup bowls. That led me to believe just as he put in herbs in soup, he did not even wash his hands afterwards. Gets me to thinking what other things he does that he does not wash up. The sauces that were set out on table were crusty on the caps and squeeze bottle openings. Again, for cleanliness purposes, they need to be cleaned regularly and look presentable. I can understand if they are just running low from customer use, but to have simply dirty sauce containers is unacceptable. The food is good but just not enough for me to want to come back when I know I can go to other places like Saigon Palace in Charlotte NC and pay around the same prices and a dollar more for food knowing the servers are clean and the people who work in the back are clean. Yes, this is just my thoughts but. I wanted others to know food is not always everything, as I don't want to risk my health for good food. I will go elsewhere for  cleaner experience. If they clean themselves up, I'll be there in a second. But otherwise, never again."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now, and have loved everything we've ordered.    Service: The service is really good - the owner is such a kind man, and always comes out to greet our children.  This is definitely a good place for kids.  Food comes out fast, fresh, and hot!  Atmosphere: What you would expect from a storefront restaurant, but with nice touches.  Not the \"hole-in-the-wall\" you might think it is based on the exterior.    Food: All we could ask for.  The fresh spring roll appetizer is solid - a couple of shrimp and fresh goods packed inside, with a nice peanut dipping sauce.  Our kids (range of 3-9) split the House Spicy Chicken, but order it non-spicy.  It's a nice, sweet, stir-fried dish served with steamed rice.  They love it.  I ordered the Pork Clay Pot the first time, and it was solid - slightly sweet, perfect texture, served with steamed rice.  The pho is where it's at, though.  We typically get Pho Tai (thinly sliced rare beef that cooks in the broth) and Pho Ga (chicken).  The beef pho has a rice, hearty broth, while the chicken pho has a lighter broth.  The spices/herbs are blended perfectly.  You can taste the coriander, anise, cilantro and ginger.  The huge bowls are served with a plate of fresh items - limes, bean sprouts, jalapeno slices, and Thai basil.  Condiments on the table are, of course, sriracha and hoisin sauce.  The portions are generous, and the meal utterly satisfying.    Not much more to say.  Prices are very reasonable - pho is around $8, other dishes are up to $11.  I'll probably try the bun sometime soon."}
{"text":"I really wanted pho but didn't want to drive to the eastside to my regular spots and found Pho Nam to be closer to me at the time.  I probably should have just waited to get to my regular spots because the pho was not that great and the ingredients were ok but not as fresh as I'm used to and the jalapeno's were not even hot.........how does that happen?  I also had a summer roll, the shrimp was not deveined and the peanut sauce looked very strange, but the taste was ok.  The owners were very nice but unfortunately the food is just not that good."}
{"text":"Pho is pretty good! I like It because it's traditional and not overly salty like most. I would not recommend ordering spring rolls because they are tiny and not much too them. Overall a good place to get your pho fix:)"}
{"text":"I live in Los Angeles where we are spoiled by dozens of excellent pho restaurants. Pho Nam is quite good and could easily compete against similar places in LA. Iced coffee with condensed milk brewed at your table, fresh spring rolls and delicious bowls of aromatic broth. I had the pho tai and it came with ample meat and noodles. The owner is really attentive and the service is friendly. Only flaw was the awful muzak! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who has a hangover or needs a break from the usual north carolina bbq and burger fare."}
{"text":"For this area it's a good Vietnamese cuisine. The food is authentic, restaurant is clean and the staff are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This little spot is consistently awesome. I'm there at least twice a month..... The owner and his family are very friendly and accommodating. I really can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"This was honestly the best Vietnamese food I have ever had! The pho was DELICIOUS along with every other thing that we had. I definitely look forward to returning ALL the time! A true diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Best Pho in the Mooresville/Huntersville NC area by far. The service is quick, the Pho is spectacular... I cannot speak to any other items on the menu as I don't dare not order he Pho. The owner always offers you a free pop (soda if you're native to these parts) or water to go."}
{"text":"There are not that many Vietnamese restaurants here in the Cornelius area. Usually, there are more Sushi and Chinese restaurants.   We ordered 2 Rare Beef with Rice Noodle Soup. The soup is scrumptious. Love the noodles. Even though it was rare beef, the beef is totally cooked after a while. We were so hungry after the soup that we also ordered a rice dish.   The Grilled Pork rice dish was a tad too sweet. Will stick with the Pho the next time around."}
{"text":"The closest pho spot to my place. If I'm craving a quick fix this would be it. Pho is decent. It's only available in one size. Slim pickin's. Not as many options to choose from like most Pho spots around the nation. Broth is decent along with portion but definitely not worth the price. We ordered the egg rolls/spring rolls. HORRIBLE. When the server placed it on the table my husband and I looked at it and didn't know what to do with it. Over cooked, yellow and the size of 2 jumbo sized chapsticks cut up in 4s."}
{"text":"Excellent little vietnamese restaurant with the sweetest owner!  I usually eat at Pho Real but a friend recommended this place.  Before heading there, I read the reviews on Yelp and noted all the comments about the sanitation issues.  So I went in with hole-in-the-wall expectations.  I had the spring roll and veggie pho. My husband the beef pho and egg roll.  Huge portions with fresh basil and sprouts.  I tasted my husbands and both were very well flavored and I would say much better than Pho Real.    Better than the meal was the a little man whom I took as the owner.  He was just the sweetest guy who offered to make me a veggie broth instead of the beef (which he did and was amazing), offered me a free drink on the house to go (which I kindly declined in lieu of my water) and actually separated my noodles from my broth when I asked for the remainder of my pho to go.  Fantastic little mom and pop restaurant.  Go in with the right expectation and you will have an amazing Vietnamese meal.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The best pho in my area, I've tried others and this place has broth that isn't bland and has a good amount of meat included. I go there by myself and eat just because it's my favorite pho place. Pricing is decent too!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and service. The young man that works there always remembers me and my family. Also, he and the other gentleman always greet us with a smile. I drive past a closer Vietnamese location for these reasons. Check them out!!!"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom. Love this place.  I took a star away for the size and cleanliness (not very appealing to the eyes.) I get the pho with rare beef on the side ( so it can cook in the boiling soup) and it is delish!  Reminds me of the pho I had in the outskirts of Vegas. The basil is super fresh and the staff is accommodating and friendly.  They also have siracha in stock so they automatically win nj my book. I haven't tried anything else yet- wish they had lettuce wrapped spring rolls!"}
{"text":"I want to recommend this place but....Twice my food smelled terrible and spoiled. I've had good food from here in the past but recently  there was a hair in my rice. Look and smell your food carefully before you eat it. They season it a lot maybe to cover up the spoilage. The owner should buy fresh food and check his food carefully."}
{"text":"Pho Nam is owned by a very caring family.  I have been there twice and it seems the father is the only chef and he is always cooking.  The first time that I went, a regular took me, the old man came out of the kitchen and greeted us.  We ordered a traditional meal that was not on the menu, it was a wide noodle dish with chicken.  Just outstanding!  The old man came out to check on us several times.  A week later I went back by myself and the old man remembered me, this time he made me a dish with shrimp and thin noodles.  It was out of this world.  Anyway, if your expecting  a finely decorated place, forget it, they have a room, tables and just plain old great eating!"}
{"text":"Pros to coming to this place: Oh man the pho is comforting. Plus amazing, authentic Vietnamese Coffee. Definitely get the pho with everything in it -- you can't go wrong. The broth definitely tastes like it's homemade and not with any of that weird bouillon cube taste that sometimes shows up.   Cons to coming to this place: none? you're missing out if you don't go."}
{"text":"Exactly what we were looking for! I ordered the Pho Chin (well cooked beef). The beef was delicious. Per usual with Pho, the portion was way more than enough.   The restaurant is small with simple decor - very casual environment, which made it perfect for lunch.   The best part was the customer service from the owners: they insisted that we take a free bottled water or soda to go from their cooler.  Thanks for a good lunch!"}
{"text":"The food is great, especially the pork vermicelli. That's my go dish, you can opt to get it with rice if you don't like noodles.The Quail are amazing and so are there Wednesday pork bun mi (you have to call Tue and pre order). I just wish there pho broth was on point."}
{"text":"Pho Nam is a takeout staple in our household.  The food quality is excellent, but the consistency of what comes with the Pho package seems to vary from trip to trip.  Sometimes you get a ton of bean sprouts, sometimes you don't.   Pho Nam is one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants in the Charlotte area.  Unfortunately, the dining experience at the restaurant is slightly boring and basic but the staff is always friendly and smiling."}
{"text":"This is the best pho I've ever had.. Started going here 3 years ago when I would visit from Florida. When I first moved here I lived close and would go once a week. We went so often that Brian one of the sons knows us by name! We get excellent service every single time and even though we live about 1 hour away we only go to see Brian at pho name when we want pho."}
{"text":"Quaint little place with a friendly staff. The food was very fresh and quite good. The grilled pork marinade was a tad sweet for me, however. The fresh spring rolls are much thinner than I'm used to but were tasty."}
{"text":"Service was good food was good not the best pho (my opinion comes from pho's I've had in California) I got the prawns an it was regular sized shrimp very disappointed. Their broth needs a little work, but overall good experience I would eat here again..."}
{"text":"This is a no frills type of place!! The Pho is basic but good. Excellent service and good prices."}
{"text":"Best Pho in the area and the family is extremely welcoming. Great food and great service every time. I've moved away and every time I'm in town I ensure to come by.   Place is unassuming but fantastic."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pho around and all of Charlotte metro area. The spicy noodle soup is also delicious. Customer service is a 10 and the family that runs the restaurant are very cordial and super sweet! Must try!"}
{"text":"Have been to Pho Nam a few times before.  This is the best place to get Pho in the LKN area as we have tried many of the options.    Usually end up getting the Rare Beef Pho.  The only complaint that I have is the lack of appetizers.  We have tried a few and they are alright.  We come for the Pho.    It's a little mom and pop place that has good service, good prices and most of all Great Pho.  This gem is hidden away but don't let that keep you away."}
{"text":"Been coming here regularly for almost 6 years. Never have I once had a bad experience. The food is always so fresh and I cant say I have ever had better Vietnamese food. Must try their summer rolls they are out of this world"}
{"text":"Love this place! The family that owns it are beyond friendly! Food is good, service is great! Can't complain!"}
{"text":"I have been away from this area for a while and haven't had the pleasure of pho nam. The food is fresh and delicious. The owner is so nice! My son and I had pho and the chicken curry chef's special tonight and it was wonderful. We got take out and I was so happy all of the traditional accoutrements were included with pho. The chicken with lemongrass and vermicelli is also a dish not to miss! This is authentic Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"Went here on 2 different occasions during lunch. Their hours of operation each time was not accurate according to any online source google or yelp. Went today 6/15/17 around 1pm and the man said they weren't open (sign said open) never going here again. Inconsistent with hours of operation.

{"text":"This is a great little place.  I live in Charlotte but work in Cornelius and this has become one of my favorite lunch places. The owner is the sweetest man. You will always get a good meal and great service!"}
{"text":"O M G! Amazing food and service. I live in Charlotte and have been craving authentic Vietnamese cuisine. Highly recommended for families, groups, friends, dates and especially by yourself so you can stuff your face!   Get ittttt!"}
{"text":"As I headed out on the road North up I-77 back to Virginia - I was craving Pho, I found Pho Nam using Yelp.  Beware, the GPS directions are wrong - the Maps App wanted to direct me down Nautical Drive to get there - Nautical Drive is part of a residential area directly adjacent to the small retail complex in which Pho Nam is located - which is off of Catawba Avenue - not Nautical Drive!  It was after the lunch rush when I arrived - about 3:00 pm so the restaurant was empty. I grabbed a table and the two gentleman working were very helpful. I asked whether their Pho Ga was made with a chicken broth or a beef broth. He advised it was a beef broth - but reiterated that it was very good because they cook it a long time - he made this point several times. So I opted to try their Pho Ga with beef broth.  The soup came out quickly, along with the plate of aromatics: everything was fresh - bean sprouts, basil, Jalapeños, and lime.  I tasted the broth before adding anything - I was not a fan of the broth. I then added the aromatics - which made it somewhat better. The chicken was very tender, the noodles were not clumped and the broth was steaming.  I added my usual doses of Sriracha sauce to bites as I worked my way through the bowl. I also added a good bit of Sriracha sauce to the broth to kick it up a bit.  I prefer Pho Ga to be served with a chicken broth. I advised the gentlemen that I thought their Pho Ga would be better if they switched to a chicken broth. The smiled and told me their beef broth is very good.  Overall, a nice little neighborhood joint, if I was back in the area I'd probably try it again for a beef Pho. The folks working here are very nice"}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant, so the quiet atmosphere was nice and provided quick service.   Pros: Seated immediately and the food was served soon after ordering. Also when you leave you can take a cold bottle of water for free (funny alternative to a mint or candy lol).   Cons: The menu provided on this Yelp page is incorrect. I went in expecting the pho to be only $6.95, but it's actually $8.95 for the simpler pho varieties and then $9.95 for pho dac biet (the one with many different meat types). So... I'm pretty disappointed by the misleading advertisement, but I guess I should've known that it was too cheap/good to be true. I'm not sure if this is an issue caused by Yelp or the business.   In the end, it's really just like any other pho restaurant in terms of price and taste. Not bad but not special enough that I'd return often (I'm from Southeast Charlotte and visit the Lake Norman area occasionally). But if you're close by and craving pho, this is a good place."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Our first time. The Pho is wonderful. Everything was good. Service was nice but slow - but it was a busy Friday night.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is where I always stop for a meal break on my road trip drive home from NJ-GA. Conveniently located close by I-77. The food is really authentic could tell they're honest about serving good food and not just decors. The service is always very fast and courteous.    And yes they did recently get new tables it looks like. They are very nice. Definitely worth a visit if you're fan of Pho and Vietnamese food :-)"}
{"text":"2 stars because I've had better. I had the fried rolls and a bowl of beef pho. Only two rolls to an order and they were small. The beef pho wasn't very flavorful even with sauces and toppings. Also, the waiter brought both soups to the table and spilled a good amount of soup down my arm. We're talking scalding hot broth. He apologized but it definitely put a damper on our lunch. $20 for two bowls of pho and an order of spring rolls."}
{"text":"stuck in traffic on 77 and was hungry so fired up yelp on my phone and found this restaurant. When we arrived the owner let us in anyway even the sign said will reopen at 5pm (we arrived at 440pm).   All your basic Vietnamese dishes are on the menu, rice plates, Vermicelli..etc. We both ordered combo pho and it tastes great! We also ordered Shirmp roll and it was good. The owner John is very nice and attentive. After he found out I was from the bay area, he started chatting with me about how he lived there for many years and had restaurant there as well. overall a great experience dinning here and will be back next time I am in the area"}
{"text":"Was pleased with their food and service. Place was clean and enough sitting area. Only thing was a little off is their bathrooms/storage/laundry ....  solid 4"}
{"text":"I tried this place a long time ago (maybe 3/4 years ago) and the owner and his daughter were incredibly friendly. The customer service was unbeatable, they even offered us complimentary drinks. However, I wasn't so impressed by the food. I got the chicken pho and asked for veggies in it. I was told they didn't have veggies like broccoli and carrots to add to my soup. So, sadly, I didn't return.   Fast forward to tonight and I was craving pho. I drive by this place all the time and finally decided it might be time to give it another shot...I'm so glad I did! The customer service was still top notch, still got a complimentary drink, but this time I got the well-done beef pho and they had the veggies to add AND the food was perfect! It was flavorful and hearty and totally hit the spot. Plus, maybe the best part, it was only around $7! A deal that's impossible to beat. Can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"This is a nice, family-owned Vietnamese restaurant.  The food is good and authentic, and service is great.  We visit Pho Nam about once a month, and the owners always remember what we like, which makes for easy ordering (and we have special requests!).  The pho (soups), fried rice, and noodle dishes are all very good, as well as the appetizers.  The dining room is not fancy, but the tables are spread far enough apart that you are not too close to your neighbors.  What a great find in Cornelius!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious and the owner is super nice! Will definately stop by again if my family and I are ever in the area!"}
{"text":"Good stuff. They are known for their soup, but I went with the chicken and rice. Also had a small soup on the side. Here's a breakdown:  Chicken: 4 Rice: 5 Soup: 5 Customer Service: 5 Cleanliness: 4 Atmosphere: 4.5 - This depends on what your'e looking for. If you want something fancy, it's not for you. If you want something genuine, it's for you.   I still have to try the steak, but a 5 overall for now."}
{"text":"Really authentic Vietnamese food in the Lake Norman area.  My wife had the grilled pork, which was really tender and had a lot of flavor.  I had the pho tai and it had an excellent broth and was comparable to the pho i had in CA.  It is a family owned establishment and the service is very friendly. This will be our go to place for vietnamese food"}
{"text":"Summer roll not fresh and only sprouts and 1 shrimp.   Pho, great broth but not enough mystery cow parts."}
{"text":"Every time we go into this place, the service is wonderful and the food is excellent! I have not had anything I haven't liked, and the food is consistent. This is our go to Pho place!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for lunch, awesome food, fast and friendly service and good prices."}
{"text":"Good pho but even better service.  John was very attentive in making sure everything was to my liking.  The house spicy sauce was great with my combination pho. He even offered me a drink to go (on the house). Come here if you like great service and you are looking for good food."}
{"text":"This place is what it is, a pho place. As such, expect nothing fancy, just good old fashioned soulful pho. If you have never tried this Vietnamese noodle soup, you are missing out. It is similar at many pho restaurants but certainly the broth here is as good as anywhere and they serve it with the requisite accessories: bean sprouts, jalapeños, basil and lime. It can be vegetarian, beef, seafood or chicken. I stick to pho in Vietnamese restaurants but they have stir fry dishes as well. Their fried quail appetizer is definitely worth trying. The Vietnamese coffee will also help restart your day as well! Great family owned place."}
{"text":"This place is great! I stumbled upon in on a drive around the area and glad I did --its the real deal very authentic! For any asian gal it hit the spot because for me , its not about how many pieces of meat  in pho ( even though it was plentiful) but it  is about the flavor -- was  sooo good and subtle with mixed notes . I loved it . I have to agree about the owner- he is so kind and seems to be a good hearted man . The place is casual but I  think the real emphasis was on the right stuff-- the food ! The coffee was soo good . The pork was soo yummy . A great mom and pop venue of good eats,!"}
{"text":"This is a great place; I just recently moved near the restaurant and have found myself going weekly since I discovered it. Great egg rolls, and especially delicious shrimp rolls and tofu rolls. The food is fresh and the chef is very helpful- my mother has an allergy to cilantro and it is never in our food when we ask. An entree highlight is the house spicy chicken- even if it isn't on the board as a special, try asking for it."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here twice and my trip today (8/21) was awesome! The Pho Tai is amazing. The broth is so, so flavorful and the garnishes are very fresh! I can't stop thinking about it. I can't wait to try more of their dishes. If you want good Pho, go here!  The owner is super sweet as well. He let me and my friend have free drinks from the fridge (he lets everyone--but it's still very generous) and he also gave me extra noodles and broth to take home for free :)"}
{"text":"I really love this place.  The meatball Pho is absolutely delicious and I always get the Korean short ribs.  I've heard some reviews questing the authenticity of the food and I can say it stacks to to all the Pho spots I've been to in the SF bay area which obviously has a high Asian population.  So not sure where they have had better Pho cause this place is as good as it gets!  Plus the owner is very friendly and cool.  Good service and great food!"}
{"text":"I was in Cornelius, NC for the first time and thanks to the power of modern GPS systems, I discovered there was a nearby Vietnamese restaurant!   Pho Nam is in a brick business center. It's small, plain, but the service is adequate and friendly. It was far from a busy restaurant with two other guys ordering To Go. We sat at a table and they had the typical Sriracha hot sauce and black bean sauce on the table - a good sign so far. The menu had the typical Vietnamese favorites. We ordered the Pho Chin (well-done beef noodle soup) and my usual Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio.   The food came quickly and both were average. The Pho broth was very clear and lightly flavored, sweet, but not very beefy - perhaps lightened up for American palettes. The beef was tender and the Pho, all in all ,was not bad. $6.95.   The vermicelli with pork and egg rolls looked pretty good, but again the dipping sauce here was mild, the pork was seasoned nicely and well cooked. The egg rolls were wrapped in a yellowish rice paper wrapper, not very crisp and different than what I'm accustomed to. $8.95  Still, the meal was satisfying and kudos to a mom and pop restaurant that serves food with a smile."}
{"text":"Love this place! Rice dishes and pho are all amazing! I loved the cooked beef and pork rice dish, always amazing!"}
{"text":"Another place that I drive by at least 5 times a week but, until yesterday, had never tried.  I've not had much experience with Vietnamese food before outside of a few Bahn Mi sandwiches over the years and was excited to further stretch my culinary legs.  My wife and I came around lunchtime on a Saturday and were the only customers until the end of our meal when a family came in.  She ordered a cold noodle dish with chicken, Bun Ga Nuong Xa and I got a Shrimp spring roll and Pho Tai which is a rare beef Pho.  I loved the spring roll, we both loved her dish and I thought the Pho was just ok.  BUT... Don't take it from me that it's not good Pho cause I really have no idea.  It just was not a flavor profile that I enjoy.  The service was quick efficient and the food came out quickly.  As we were leaving an older man came out of the kitchen, thanked us for coming in, made sure we enjoyed everything and offered us free drinks to go out of the cooler.  A very nice touch!  There were many other things on the menu that I would like to try and will certainly come to Pho Nam again."}
