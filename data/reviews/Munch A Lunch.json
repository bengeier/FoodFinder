{"text":"I ordered a veggie sandwich on wheat, and when I opended the sandwich I could not believe it!  All shredded lettuce, 2 tiny pieces of tomatoe and a few olives.  I have given this place enough chances, it is horrible don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from here through Grub Hub for the first time today because I have a lunch time meeting scheduled and no vehicle to pick up lunch myself.  Grub hub made the ordering easy and I was told the delivery would take 45 - 60 minutes.

I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich with potato salad and strawberry lemonade.

My order arrived in less than 15 minutes (the driver said it is because I got the order in before the lunch rush.  He said they get slammed around 11:30 - 1:30 PM, so if you're ordering during those times, expect some delays.)  The potato salad was nice and cold and the chicken sandwich was nice and warm.  The bread tasted fresh and the chicken was juicy and tender and cooked all the way through.  The pesto they use is pretty darn good, lots of flavor, as you would expect from pesto.  Potato salad was ok, but tasted like it came out of a tub of Kroger brand potato salad.  Not bad but not the best either, and certainly not fresh.

I would not say this is THE BEST FOOD EVER, but I will order from here again and share the menu with co-workers who are looking for an affordable, tasty, quick lunch."}
{"text":"I will gladly give Lunch a Munch 5 stars! I've only had food delivered and haven't gone into the business, but they are always nice over the phone. The delivery guy is always polite and nice.  Delivery service is usually super quick too.  Great food, good prices- great for an alternative when I don't feel like going out for lunch. I'm glad I found them!"}
{"text":"This place is quaint, clean and the food is good. Nice portion sizes and well priced. The previous owner would always allow this guy's fat pug to run All over the restaurant and hand feed it. The dog would even go back in the kitchen.I love animals but not inside a restaurant.This turned me off from going so hopefully new management doesn't allow this."}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast delivery... super fast! And holly crap was everything fresh and great tasting! The pineapple smoothie was bomb.com"}
{"text":"Awesome place, quick delivery!! I have gotten wraps here a few times and they haven't messed up my order which is nice! It's a good spot to hang for lunch"}
{"text":"If your in the Tempe area and are looking for a good breakfast or lunch, do yourself a favor and stop in to Munchalunch.  I love going here because the menu has great variety and I can always find something tasty.  I also have to say that its a great value, all of the items are well priced and the portion sizes are generous."}
{"text":"Found this little gem around the corner from our new office about 3 months back and have been a frequent visitor ever since (at least once a week).  Like the other reviews mention, its location is super random (in a commercial office complex), but super convenient for me!  I can jam out of the office, grab lunch for the crew and myself, and be back in 15 minutes.  A win in my book.

As for the tasty morsels they've got to offer, I really haven't had anything bad.  From the meat and spinach pies (a syrian and lebanese delicacy), to the perfectly toasted turkey melt, I tend to leave this place a happy camper on a regular basis.  Everything off the menu is prepared to order (and comes out quick I might add), and they also offer a daily special called the \"lunch box\".

While the Turkey Melt is a close second, the lunch box is the main reason I continue to come back to Munch a Lunch.  I'm usually running pretty hot and have little time to eat, so the fact I can walk in, grab a sandwich that was made that morning accompanied by chips and a drink is a HUGE draw for me.  Especially when it only costs $4.  I mean, you can't even get a 6\" at subway with chips and a drink for less than $5, and Munch a Lunch is using real meat!

Quality, fast, delicious and friendly.  Keep up the good work \"boddy\"."}
{"text":"Love this little place for a quick and very affordable sandwhich! The chicken pesto is my favorite, always the perfect amount of pesto and chicken with tomato and lettuce. The service is great too, everyone here is so nice!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch around 1:15, not expecting it to take 25 minutes for a salad. Sadly, this place is under staffed and lacking everything needed to be a good lunch spot. I DON'T recommend it. If you want a good sandwich place, drive down the street to Dilly's Deli or any of the other sandwich shops in Tempe, your wallet, your time, and your stomach will thank you."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a quick smoothie before heading to the gym with my friend. I got the pineapple coconut smoothie (the only thing missing in it was some rum :p) which was delish and my friend got the mango flavored smooth in which she loved as well. Very clean inside which is def a big plus for me. 

It's sort of hidden so unless you know about it or happen to notice the cute butterfly chairs out front while driving by, you can easily miss it. I plan on coming back to do lunch here next time since some of their salads did catch my eye!"}
{"text":"It was ok if you're looking for a cheap basic sandwich. I didn't love it but I didn't dislike it. I ordered american cheese on mine and it tasted like the Kraft struggle slice. It might have been better if I chose another cheese option. But other than that it was good. The indoor seating is comfortable and quiet. At least when I went at 11am."}
{"text":"As Erica O. mentions, definitely was a freezer burn issue with the firecracker shrimp? on my last trip"}
{"text":"2 stars for delivery service 3.5 stars for quality of food.

I used to order delivery from Munch A Lunxh to my office all the time. I recently relocated back to Phoenix again and found out they have new ownership. Not a lot has changed except they added a delivery fee. I feel like the quality of food and service has declined as they have gotten busier. 

The last order I placed took 1 hour to deliver (I am 3 blocks away) and the food was cold (breakfast burrito), also they gave me a Monster when i ordered a Red Bull. I would have just ordered lunch if I knew breakfast would take so long to deliver.

I will probably not order from Munch A Lunch again."}
{"text":"Looking for a good lunch to treat co-workers just picked up from the airport before our meeting.   Friendly and helpful staff. Lots of menu options. Excellent food. Got the egg salad that was made when I ordered!  My co-workers got a tuna melt, #30 ( suggested popular choice ) & southwest soup. Service was fast.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This place it so tiny, hidden and so cute. I've gone in and the folks inside have always been a treat. I don't' always do salads, and such, but the ones available here are so good, any other places seem inadequate."}
{"text":"This place is so good that I'm writing a Yelp review 9 years after the last time I ate there. I used to get breakfast burritos delivered to my work 2-3 times a week. It was a luxury that I've missed now for almost a decade. And on top of missing that amazing service, the burrito itself has also yet to find an equal."}
{"text":"Well lets just start off with the BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE that I just experienced with the \"manager/owner\" of this place. Our office place orders from this place very often. I was heading back to the office and called this place to order a sandwich for delivery. A lady came on the phone (never talked to her for the last 2 years we've ordered) and she was just so unprofessional over the phone. Didnt want to take my order properly and just kept rushing me off the phone and demanding my credit card number. She failed to ask me what type of bread I wanted, she failed to ask me what I would want in my sandwich, OH and heres the kicker, she got mad at me WHEN I ASKED HER why she failed to ask me what size of sandwich i wanted? (6inch or 12 inch) SHE HUNG UP ON ME.  I called back, and I asked if we got disconnected or IF SHE HUNG UP ON A CUSTOMER, she happily said, \"Yup I sure did hang up on you!!\" 

Well, our office is 2 mins away that I figured, maybe I'd come in and talk to a manager for the HORRIBLE EMPLOYEE that they hired!! I walk in and find out that this HORRIBLE EMPLOYEE is the owner and manager of this place! She ignored everything I said about being professional and HOW SHE IS SUPPOSE TO CONDUCT A BUSINESS and all her comments were \"Are you gonna place an order or what?\" I was beyond belief that this person conducts her business so poorly that she can careless about the professionalism of it all.

I advise our business office TO NEVER EVER ORDER from this company again!! I will be sure to aware others of the nonchalant careless RUDE customer service they conduct!! 
PS Im sure this is the business owner STEVES (who is sweet and very polite) WIFE!!! She needs to just let her husband run the business and keep her RUDE A$$ at home! She just costed him a company of faithful Munchers!!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot with great prices. I usually get a salad which is pretty hefty in size. I love that they use chicken straight off the grill for the Chicken Caesar. They have great specials available for each day of the week.  If you're in a hurry be sure to order online ahead of time and your food will be waiting for you."}
{"text":"I got the pesto chicken specialty sandwich. It's good but I'm not too impressed with the chicken. 

Definitely a place to try out."}
{"text":"A quaint and clean place for a quick lunch. My office orders from there weekly and the food and atmosphere do not disappoint. I am glad they are doing well and the menu is impressive but still it's a bit pricey for the area imo. My problem is that I'm already addicted to their egg salad so I guess I will be back!"}
{"text":"I thought the place was okay, but nothing tremendously special. The crew at Modavox swears by this place for delivery (well some of them anyway). I needed to get out of the office on a recent visit so I decided to drive over to them in Tempe. 

I had a nice talk with the young guy, who may have been the owner. He was very interested when I told him I was from San Diego. He wants to open one of these over there. I think he might have a good chance, although there are many similar and better places already.

I got the California sandwich, being from California, of course. (Turkey, Swiss, sprouts, tomato, avocado) It normally comes with mayo but I substituted mustard. The sandwich was actually much better priced for a foot-long than many other places. The place was very contemporary but I felt the sandwich was just okay. I also got chips, but bagged chips is bagged chips no no review necessary. Would I go again? Maybe."}
{"text":"I like this place. The prices are reasonable and the food is good. Breakfast and lunch are good. My favorite is their breakfast croissant."}
{"text":"Very nice employees who make a great salad!"}
{"text":"SO SAD.

I believe there are new owners here and it just seems like there is a totally different vibe here. I went on my own and the food was still good but then we tried to order for our office and we actually got a phone call telling us that our order was \"too labor intensive\" and complained basically, about getting business!

To try and give them the benefit of the doubt, I do understand for larger orders, that this can be a little more difficult but with 100 other sandwich shops in the area and being in the Tempe area, you'd think that a company wouldn't complain at all about more money. Am I wrong?

If you think the order is going to be difficult, just charge more for labor costs or something of the sort beforehand rather than calling after the order has been placed and saying that it was \"too much\". SHEESH.

Munch A Lunch has lost my business because of this. I work my butt off everyday and would ALWAYS accept more money and I can't respect a company who doesn't feel the same.

Arizona Sandwich Company will take the business any day, and they will!"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy and tasty! Used to go here quite a bit with co-workers from UOP. Love the breakfast sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Gotta love the way these guys advertise - free food samples!!  They came into our office a couple months ago with some of their Spicy Hummus....the rest as they say is history!!  I order from here 1-2 times a week, everyone there is super nice. And I like that you can place your order online. The free delivery is a definite plus!

I love the Spicy Hummus & the Dumplings, but the best thing on the menu has to be the Chicken Caesar Wrap - the homemade garlic dressing is phenomenal! All of their sandwiches are pretty unique from your standard sub shop, and I love that about them. The only thing I don't care for is their Gyros - and I love Gyros."}
{"text":"I gave this place 5 stars because it deserves it. It is a small, quiet place to have simple, great tasting food that's just like home made. When my girlfriends and I walked in the guy at the counter was very friendly and looked just like one of the Wahlberg brothers (bonus points if I could have given more than 5 stars), haha! 

So he began by explaining the wide variety of food choices and how the combo works. We paid then sat down at a table, there were several to choose from and all were clean waiting for customers. He delivered our food to the table and everything was exactly as we ordered. I got a sandwich and my girlfriends ordered wraps. Plenty of food for us. 

Shortly after we got our food, Mr Walhberg checked on us to make sure we were happy. He was very attentive but not over baring. When he noticed we were getting ready to go he bagged up the rest of my sandwich and thanked us for our visit. We will go back. Just know that this is a small, simple, clean, down to earth place with good food. And as far as those places go, this one is a 5 star in my book!"}
{"text":"Backstory: I was on PTO/vacay and Friday morning my boss calls me and asks \"where's lunch?\" and I answer, \"in Portland\" (Oregon).  Wrong answer! She's in Tempe AZ doing a training for a big group. SO I jump on Grubhub and find a close caterer with a big menu AND Munch A Lunch saved me!!

I filled out the Grubhub with THIRTY various items - PLENTY of food it turned out. I even got a follow-up call from someone there that checked on my order. I expressed they could choose a full variety that would include enough and not wipe them out of one type of bread.  They built it all, delivered it, and brought it all in for setup.   

I've never been to Tempe, do not know the lay of the land when it comes to catering but Munch A Lunch made me look good. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"So I was looking for a spot to get a quick snack before the gym. I remembered a little place around the corner I use to go to all the time when I worked in the area. I was happy to see it was still there.

If you didn't know it was there, it's easy to miss. They now have cute but unusually looking set of chairs and tables outside now with umbrellas. (So don't miss it) I always think it nice when you have the option to sit inside or outside when the day is nice.

I didn't try any of the food this time but did try a smoothie. There are limited flavors but I must say the mango smoothie is amazing!! It taste exactly like a mango, not to sweet and very flavorful!! My friend got a pineapple coconut smoothie. She let me try it and that was good as well. I would definitely recommend it over a chain smoothie establishment."}
{"text":"Great owner's. I'm a big fan of the Buffalo chicken wrap and the pesto sandwich. I will keep going back."}
{"text":"I order and visit this establishment quite frequently. I get the bagel breakfast sandwich with bacon, cream cheese and egg, SO AMAZING! They always know my exact order and they don't skimp on the extra bacon or cream cheese! Super fast, super friendly. It's literally a 2 min bike ride from my house as well! I will keep eating here for sure! Thank you, munch a lunch! I appreciate your great food, quick delivery, and kind people!!!"}
{"text":"I would never have known of this establishment's existence if it wasn't for the small dining area out front with umbrellas and strange wrought-iron flutterby and dragonfly shaped chairs and tables. Not very comfortable to dine in, but cutesy nonetheless. It also helps that I now work in the surrounding area, since Munch-a-Lunch seems to cater exclusively to the business parks around it. Although it's nothing to write home about, it does a pretty fine job of sating my hunger.

This small hole-in-the-wall joint caters to those on the go with a five dollar sandwich box that consists of a sammich, bag o' chips, candy bar and canned soda. It's a screaming deal compared to most fast food meal deal prices, and you can be in and out in a few minutes. However, if you're willing to wait around a bit (and maybe try out those funky butterfly chairs or watch an old black and white movie on the tele inside), the made to order specials and salads are usually pretty solid and a good bang for your lunch buck. 

One gripe I have with this place is that the consistency is wildly variable depending on the day. I've ordered the Greek salad numerous times (what can I say, I'm a sucker for beets in a salad) and it's been nigh inedible at times due to a heavy hand with the salty dressing and feta cheese. So order dressing on the side if you're a featherweight like me. At times some items have been a bit stale as well. I've had some unfortunate puff pastry that seemed like it had been freezer burned or microwaved a hair too long. And they have a strange propensity for smothering things in sour cream sauce. 

These are little issues in the overall quality of the food though. Sandwiches and salads are always a solid bet, and the Greek menu items have rarely let me down! 

Give it a shot if you're in the area. There's worse things you could do to yourself for five bucks."}
{"text":"Just moved our office nearby and wanted to try this place out.  Got the Pesto Chicken Sandwich combo and it was delicious!  HUGE ice tea too.  I believe I ordered with the owner, who was very nice... Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Had ordered as part of a group order - through Grub Hub. Had an issue with items being missing from my salad. No muss, no fuss, simple email / text process and the food was replaced. 
PERFECT for a super busy day without enough time to 'deal' with lunch. 

AND the food was excellent."}
{"text":"delivery driver was quick and courteous. ordered through grub hub and it got here a half hour early. i got the supreme sandwich and the cranberry candied walnut salad with chicken and both exceeded expectations. would definitely come back! :)"}
{"text":"I've been going to Munch a Lunch several times in the last couple of months, and I'm surprise with the huge menu they have! a lot of variety and incredible prizes!...it's a restaurant that never gets old!. I'm always satisfied with the service and every time i have a chance to stop by and eat, Munch a Lunch it's a wise choice for me! I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Very cute place that you just don't expect to be here in a commercial complex.  It's right next to an office for Al Collins.  Give ya an idea?  There are a few shaded tables out front, and some cute ikea/minimalistic tables/chairs on the inside.  Everything looks clean and bright and new - just the way you want it to look.  And the folks who work there are always really friendly - look like college students.  

They have some nice \"Morning munch\" selections (Breakfast) including smoothies, but I haven't tried one of them yet.  Their sandwiches and wraps though - very good. I'm not a huge fan of their turkey lunch-meat, but it's not bad - I'm just picky when it comes to turkey.  One of these days I'll eat there and try a toasted sandwich, but since I'm always a to-go girl, I figure it would be cold by the time I got back to the office.  They also have pre-made salads and sides in a case up front so you can just grab and go.  Their fruit (Cut in pieces) looked great and very fresh and for just $1.50, not a bad side at all.  Their salads are also really good sized for the money.  I will say that their chocolate chip cookies aren't quite as good as they look.  AND - while priced 2/$1, they are packaged in sets of 2, so really it's just $1.  

And oh yea - they deliver.  You can call, fax in an order, or order on-line.  Pretty fancy."}
