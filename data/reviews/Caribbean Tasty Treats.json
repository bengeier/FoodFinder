{"text":"Had their oxtail and jerk chicken last night. Their portions are really good. The rice with beans was perfectly moist. The oxtail was amazing too.

If you like your food spicy, maybe tell them ahead of time. Or add a few drops of habanero sauce to spice it up a notch hehe."}
{"text":"Good Caribbean food in the West Island? Yes!

Ducked in here for takeout one snowy night. Got a few different things ( jerk chicken, roti, festival bread, patties, black cake). Everything was fesh and flavorful, and tasted homemade. Amazing, will go again!"}
{"text":"Completely different experience this time around!
Loved it much better.
Wonderful Bob Marley playing on their speakers,  tv was off, very nice dinnerware and cutlery. 
Owner/ chef was very welcoming and helpful, warned me about the bones in the goat roti so I went with the chicken one. Great!
I had to try this place again, happy I did."}
{"text":"Our work ordered about 15 Jerk Chicken plates from Caribbean Tasty Treats. The plates came in smallish Styrofoam containers that were mostly filled with rice. It was tasty but the rice was literally 80% of the meal. I had 3 small pieces of Jerk Chicken which I found tasty but not a whole lot to eat. Also it didn't reflect the name of Jerk Chicken as it was pretty mild. Definitely will need some extra heat if you want your Jerk Chicken to by spicy with some hot sauce. My meal also came with plantain which is quite delicious...but every container only have 2 small slices? (basically a full plantain would fit in 10 plates).

Meal was good... lots of flavor and felt home-cooked... but I'm concerned about the value due to portion sizes. I'd rather receive more plantain and chicken and far less rice. Some veggies thrown in on the side would be good as well.

Service was quite slow and it was ordered ahead. So don't come here if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"Your jerk chicken is not spicy! That is why I'm giving it a 4 star. Rice and peas was delicious. I will go back to try again for the 2nd time but I will ask to make the jerk chicken spicier. My guess is to please everyone but the true way jerk chicken should be spicy. Until next time..."}
