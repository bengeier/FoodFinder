{"text":"The shrimp n grits were excellent, cheesy grits and plump big shrimp, all with a light flavorful cajon seasoning. Loved the chicken tacos & the lobster tacos were good, (better priced than Lobster Me in Mile mall). Service wondeful, friendly & attentive! Drinks are no less pricy than the usual Vegas bar BUT GOOD AND FRESH ingredients!"}
{"text":"Pregamed here!!!!!! My friends from out of town came to visit. Took em here before the club. Walkin distance from Cosmo. Good food, vibe, price, and service. Highlight*** beer pong and hot servers!!!!"}
{"text":"The eggs benedict was the best ever, definitely coming back again. The service was quick and the girls were so polite. Prices are really good too."}
{"text":"This place has amazing alcoholic beverages the food is also really good. Even though they take a long time to bring it to you. They also got a lot of beautiful women working here! With inside and outside seating. If you're on the strip and like watching sports make sure to stop here!"}
{"text":"Today was our first time in and we loved everything about it. Our great experience started with our server savanna. She greeted us almost as soon as the hostess put down our menus. We told her it was our first time and she seemed excited to give us all of her recommendations. I'm fairly picky about cocktails but she was able to suggest some based off of what I asked. I got the Anti berry and it was so good! I love when the staff knows the menu well. We ordered the carne asada fries and a breakfast flatbread. Food came out quickly enough and it was all delicious. The music they played was even good! Our server kept our table cleaned off the whole time and was very thorough even though it seemed a bit crowded. At the end of our meal we paid and got our receipt that includes a coupon for 20% off our next meal. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service! We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share, and the food was great!"}
{"text":"We were there on a Monday night during football game, 1st wk of Nov.  The place was practically deserted, but in fairness the foot traffic out front on the Strip was very light.  So of course we were eagerly greeted and seated.  Our bar service was quick but then we only ordered beers.  We watched the wait staff as they worked the few tables and noticed the staff all just going thru the motions, quite robotic. No interest in the job or the customers was shown, pretty much blank faces.  One waitress had a trailer...apparently a trainee.   The only signs of life in staff was when they conversed with each other. 
    But for the lack of interest in customers displayed, the food this night was pretty good.  The calamari arrived fairly quickly, crisp and tasty.  The Fish & Chips were prepared well and quite good. The Cincinnati Chili 3-way was tasty tho a bit mild. For heartburn sufferers like me it was just right but for spicier-loving tastes it might not appeal.  Those would be better served with the same at Steak n Shake which has more bite. 
   Overall we enjoyed the visit and plan to return, but hope to see a more engaging staff on hand next time."}
{"text":"Was there Oct 17.  Decided to stop as I am a Pete Rose fan.  However, went out on the patio ordered a tap beer and a regular cocktail. Later had to find waitress to pay, she didn't know who, where, what.  I told her what I ordered and I got a bill for 26.75.  Nice !!  I told her that Pete Rose can stick it!!"}
{"text":"Went to Pete's for happy hour and some food. Atmosphere is great whether you want to sit outside ppl watching on the strip or inside in the AC watching the endless flat screens. 

Beers were cheap (for the strip) and food was great. We had chili cheese fries- had to try the famous Cincy chili- and buffalo wings. Both were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great simple breakfast menu, which is hard to find in Vegas. The hostess was very pleasant and seated me right away. Chanell was an awesome server too! Would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good food. shanel was cool. Big beers. Hot French fries. Got a baseball but Pete couldn't come out from the kitchen to sign it. The hall of fame can suck it"}
{"text":"Great Mule cocktails - especially love the Pineapple Express Mule cocktail! Wonderful and friendly servers!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE. Great place for sports fans and family's. Huge bar with amazing appetizers and happy hour. The portions are large and fairly priced for being right on the strip with beautiful views! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant looks okay from the outside, but the service and the food are poor. We were charged for mayonnaise and bbq sauce and weren't told about it. The food was small"}
{"text":"Nice bar, but $28 for a beer and a soda is a little outrageous.  Just came from the Hard Rock down the street and got the same thing for $12. I would definitely skip this place."}
{"text":"Husband and I were looking for a place on the strip to watch a basketball game with our young kids (which was almost impossible to do) as we were about to give up my husband decided to ask someone working at a T-shirt stand and they recommend this bar and grill and what a great recommendation it was! Our server was really great very attentive. They have indoor and outdoor seating and a great food & drink menu to choose from!"}
{"text":"Stephany was the bomb!  What a great personality and she made my experience at Pete rose's amazing.  17 stars for Stephany!"}
{"text":"Great open area and welcoming . Ordered a coffee to start and they brought it out immediately but without creamer n sugar. I Decided to order the homefried steak m eggs with homefries and it was also  brought out without the utensils. Meal looked delicious and was. Overall the meal was enjoyed. The waitress may have been new. Would give them another chance. Pleasant spot."}
{"text":"We were
Walking the strip and stopped for drinks! Services were upbeat and entertaining! My Long Island was one of the best!"}
{"text":"I asked for a menu and never got one. There was a lot of employees standing around doing not a lot of anything and I did as for menu twice never got one. Just water.. I ran out of time and left.

Closed Location"}
{"text":"Ever heard of a Cincinatti four-way? Yeah, me neither, until today! It might just be the best hangover cure, ever. So, what is it? Spaghetti, topped with chili, and THEN topped with cheese, and THEN topped with onions. It may be a few days before my boyfriend wants to kiss me again, but I am feeling full and happy."}
{"text":"The cod tacos were just the right amount of spicy but the dish doesn't come with any sides, despite being in the menu column under \"comes with two sides\"

Iced tea was served with no sugar/sweetener. I asked the server for sweetener and he actually dropped off an empty/used sugar packet as one of the three I received."}
{"text":"This  is  a good  place to watch a game and grab a beer if you  want to be on the strip but not in a casino."}
{"text":"Food was great and cheap. Minus a star for (although polite) incredibly slow service."}
{"text":"I'm really impressed with the great HH specials and the amazing appetizers like artichoke hearts and spinach dip ..... that being said the service is SLOW! Nice and pleasant but SLOW!"}
{"text":"Took 45 minutes for an over cooked Cass Burger and crispy burnt Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, never received our appetizer either. We ended up walking out hungry after manager zeroed out our check.  Walked down to Fatburger for faster service and better food."}
{"text":"The service was verry slow, and we were almost the only people there. I expected a baseball themed experience, but all the employees were very young and i got the impression they didn't even know who Pete is. They were playing garbage rap type pop music that you would NEVER hear at a ball park. I am an avid Pete Rose fan from Ohio and I was very disappointed. We were there at about 4pm on a Friday in June, 2016. The food was so-so. I won't be back."}
{"text":"By far the worse place in Las Vegas and I'm serious. Also, they lost the contract with Pete rose. So it's just called sports bar and grill. Bartender girl couldn't get any fucking drink right. No tequila, nothing at all. $15 drink that was terrible. What a waste of time! Go out of business already."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place. Here is the good: The pretzel was fantastic! Fresh, soft and gigantic! The cheese sauce was really good. The honey mustard was a little weird. The flat bread pizza was fair. The beer was cold and a fair price! Overall a descent experience.

Here is the bad: When you check in they give you a free appetizer for writing a review. Cool. You have to show them the review before they remove the appetizer from your bill. I guess that's one way to keep your reviews high, unless of course you go back and share your real experience later. The service here was really slow. The kicker was there was no one inside. So our server was not doing her job! Long story short, if your looking for a place to grab a beer and sit outside, this is it. If your looking for good food and great service, this ain't the place."}
{"text":"Great location on the strip for people watching.  The food's pretty good for bar food and you can purchase some amazing souvenirs."}
{"text":"Pete Rose has opened up a new bar and grill in the Hawaiian Marketplace on the Las Vegas Strip. The Grand Opening was last night, and I was so lucky to have been able to attend. Pete himself was there greeting customers and taking pictures. I had the opportunity to meet this man and shake his hand, and I have to say he is extremely kind and humble. 

The atmosphere is definitely a sports bar. Over 32 HD TV's surround the bar as well as each booth. You definitely won't miss a minute of the game should you choose to watch them here. Tons of Pete's memorabilia, including signed balls, bats, jerseys and tons of pictures surround the dining room. This place is huge, with over 250 seats inside, as well as a patio outside for additional seating.

The staff were helpful and friendly, coming around often to check on us and make sure drinks were filled and plates were cleared. The manager even stopped by to check and see how we liked everything, and told us that everything is made in house, and you can tell they really take pride in their food. 

All the food I tried was tasty. I wasn't super hungry, and luckily there were were plenty of appetizers to choose from, including nachos, wings, flatbread pizzas and house made soups. Entrees include burgers, salads, sandwiches, ribs, and of course Cincinnati chili. Since I was eating with a few people, I got to try many different items and they were all great. I really enjoyed the lollipop wings, with housemade ranch. They come in buffalo, thai chili, salt and pepper and bbq flavors. I also enjoyed the ribs. They were meaty and fall of the bone tender.

For dessert I had white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, made with fresh whipped cream and raspberry puree. So yummy. The pricing wasn't too bad either, for a spot on the strip. Do yourself a favor and check this place out, you might even get to meet Pete!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst service on the strip. Came in with the intention of having a few beers and chilling out for a while. Took forever just to get one beer. My bar tender was \"Miki\".  Worst bar tender I've had. Horribly inattentive like customers were a bother to her. Would never come back, wouldn't even sent my worst enemy in."}
{"text":"Sorry Pete over priced and out of the way not to have better deal.  As for sports bar the tv sucked . Service was great even tho we got there at happy hour and weren't informed. As for the food, a mediocre fare. The new BWW kicks your butt for a sports bar!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a place on the strip to watch the 2015 nfl afc championship between the Peyton Manning led Denver Broncos and Brady's Patriots. We approached from the Strip side and was promptly greeted. Our host Tisa placed us right in front of a TV outside with a great view of the Crystals mall. She made a beer suggestion based on what I liked and drink suggestion for my wife! She was on the spot my wife's margarita was perfect and my beer was perfect. We ordered a Trio Tower of Shrimp Scampi, Chicken and Waffle Slider, and Calamari and really enjoyed everything. The staff was excellent we never had an empty glass and overall they were great company from the host to waitress to our busser! 

Now the best part was the Executive Chef came out and asked how was everything and I asked what I should try on his suggestion and his response was \"Perfect, I'll send something out!\" He sent out Cincinnati Chili Cheese fries and Fish tacos. 

If you are a chili fan expect a different flavor This chili is on the sweeter side of chili but it was a great change of pace. The fish tacos were perfect, not dry and dressed well I didn't have to put anything on it.

Overall the experience was great! The ambience, the view, the food, but most of all the attentive staff and when the Chef came out it was the icing on the cake we were impressed! Plan on visiting in the future"}
{"text":"We made a reservation here to watch game 7 of the World Series. When we arrived at 3:30 on a Wednesday we were surprised to see only one other person in the whole bar. The staff was accommodating by moving tables but we quickly realized this place wasn't all that great. The bar isn't even associated with Pete Rose anymore, his name is blacked out on everything. They were out of ALL domestic beers on tap except Budweiser. What kind of Sports Bar runs out of beer? The service was slow and unapologetic for running out of so many different beers so we quickly closed our tab and went over to Buffalo Wild Wings to watch the game. Don't waste your time here. Fabulous location, decenbut awful bar."}
{"text":"As Cincinnati residents, we were really excited to visit.  Great decor and bartenders, fantastic beer selection (26 on draft) and wide menu choices.  Nice break from the strip!"}
{"text":"Great food and draft beer selection.   Great espresso.  Staff was terrific.   TVs everywhere !"}
{"text":"Don't order the corned beef hash and eggs. Covered in oil. Service is good and prices are a little high for breakfast. Yes it's on the strip it breakfast should be less."}
{"text":"Nice quiet place to have a beer on the strip and watch a ball game. Colleen was exceptional and made me feel at home. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by here yesterday to watch game two of the World Series, and boy was it jumpin! Even though they just opened, it seems like they already had everything running smoothly. The service was fast and our waitress was very helpful. We tried two different kinds of chicken wings, the BBQ and the Thai. Both were delicious. The beer selection was nice and the prices weren't as expensive as you would expect for the quality. 

The management is doing a great job with everything. Good waitstaff. Great bartenders. Delicious food. Keep up the good work and we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great vibe at this sports bar.  My bartender was very attentive and \"hustled\" on my behalf.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Super location for people watching on the patio.  The wings were certainly above average and well spiced.  Really good selection of draft beers, including some less usual options.  The pulled pork flatbread was rich and flavorful.  Good choice.  We visited twice while in town, and enjoyed friendly, competent service both times.  A must for happy hour."}
{"text":"While my brother's obsession is what led us into the restaurant, the great food and atmosphere is what kept us there! I loved all the memorabilia and baseball theme of the restaurant, but especially loved the food. They had a great selection of beers, and my BBQ pulled pork flatbread was amazing! Other stand-out items my family ordered were the Triple BBB and the garlic mashed potatoes. I recommend this spot for anyone looking for good food and a good time - whether you're a baseball fanatic or not!!"}
{"text":"***UPDATE: Not only does this Pete Rose get a horrible review but their manager made numerous promises to \"remedy the situation\" and he has yet to live up to one.  It's a great place to visit. Don't expect too much. 

Previous reviews of crappy service weren't wrong! I gave it a chance because it's Pete Rose's joint. Not so much as a smile or acknowledgement. \"Hustle\" is on the back of their uniforms? The place was practically empty but had to wait for most everything and wave our waitress down who was mostly leaning on the bar. We seemed to inconvenience her. 

The place is beautiful! Lots of memorabilia and upper scale decor and design.  Breakfast omelet plates $11.  Came out piping hot but kinda bland. Glad I came but wont be back. I really wanted to love this place but didn't."}
{"text":"Great sports pub Pete Rose was their to greet guests. Great bbq, pizza and chicken wings. Lots of had tvs with sports on. Great place for sports fans to hang out and the beer models is on tap too. Can't beat this place looks small from outside but spacious inside. Go there! This is the best sports pub I've eve been to."}
{"text":"I found this place by happenstance it was a street guy handing out buy one get one off 16oz beers. We went out of our way back a day later because of my love for Pete Rose! So my wife and I ordered two apps because you get one free if you check in and leave a review. My wife had the fried calamari and I had the fried jalapeño coins. I will tell you I have had the coins at 10 other eateries and this place has the best hands down along with a great aioli dip!! It's a must have. My wife said the calamari was great! Then we split the main course a chicken and avocado sandwich it was perfect with lots of flavor with aioli sauce sliced carrots and avocado on a ciabatta bread! The best part of all were the amazing fries! They have some Pete Rose memorabilia which is a big positive and the decor was cool with the baseball painted ceiling!
I recommend this bar and grill!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast outside on the Las Vegas strip! What could be better!! Great atmosphere and service!"}
{"text":"Ate here 4/24 for lunch. No lunch served till 11am so ordered drinks and waited 30 mins. Service was slow and nobody seemed to know who was suppose to serve who. TV's are great but small and hard to see across room. My burger was good but hot dog buns were hard and stale. Really think this place has potential but they need more servers who know what they are doing..."}
{"text":"Loved the food and atmosphere. Server was very friendly and attentive. Cocktails were good. Would go back."}
{"text":"Food is below mediocre. Very disappointed. I saw a lot of good reviews I had high hopes. 
So here it goes
A. French  onion  soup had very little guryere  cheese  on it and overly  salty. 
B. Calamari was soggy and small portion for price they charge.
C.  Nachos were dry and the pork meat was dry and chewy.  I hardly saw any cheese on it. Came with small scoop of  generic guacamole(defiantly not fresh) on top of nachos.
D. Bottle of beer was almost $9.
E. Poutine was bad. It was rather cold when it got to table.
F.  Burger was OK. French fries came with burger was good(Big one piece curly fries, very different )
G.  Shrimp skewers were overly salty. But the grits and the Mexican shaved corns came with entrees were good.
H.  Clam chowder soup was good. Very thick and hearty.
G.  No wine menu.  Just white or red  house wine.
Over all experience  was I probably won't  come back. All the food came to table warm not hot. 
Outdoor seating is awesome with looking at Las Vegas Blvd. But the music they play is rap and it's not PG rated."}
{"text":"If your looking for a great spot on the strip for food and a great time try this spot ! Food was amazing Friendly fast service and very unique drinks . Loved the very chill atmosphere and watching the games . Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"After walking around and reading breakfast menu and after breakfast menu, we ended up at Pete Rose's restaurant.  Great location on the strip and perfect for people watching.  We were seated on the patio and glanced over the menu. I knew exactly what I wanted, just  basic breakfast with eggs, sausage, hash browns and toast. So simple, yet so hard to find in Vegas. Brian went with the lox and bagel. The service was not the best, but wasn't horrible. Overall, it was priced well, especially for the strip, and the food was really good."}
{"text":"Went here last night, ordered a Ginger and Jamison, I take a sip and it doesn't taste normal I try again, so the ginger ale was out of syrup, so I go back to the bar to tell them. Hey I hate to be this person but yalls ginger ale is outta syrup so I need a new drink. With mad attitude she says I'll have someone check on that. Shit you not stood up there 10! Mins with the same fucked up drink. So then a regular walks up and ask for what I'm drinking the bartender was so nice to him and got to making his drink right away! As if I didn't order that and get a fucked up drink, so now she sees me and I have to remind her again, now she seems mad at me and gives me maybe a tablespoon of Jamison in my damn ginger ale! Did I mention the drink was 10 dollars, so I paid 10 dollars for ginger ale and a drop of Jamison, will never be back and will tell people to save their money"}
{"text":"Thought I would try it out, waited 10 min for waitress to get to us and bring drinks then once we finally ordered we waited 45 more mins for our food to show up, appetizer never made it, my chicken sandwich was so overcooked you couldn't cut it and they said it came with fries which it did, 6 of them. The other person with me had a burger and it was over cooked as well! Sent it all back and left. The only good thing I have to say is they didn't charge us and the wait staff was polite."}
{"text":"I visited Pete Rose Sports Bar and Grill on 
May 17, 2016 around 6:00 pm,  the Hostess who greeted me had a warm smile, she made me feel very welcome she sat me out on the patio and let me know that Charmaine will be my server and she will be right with me. Steven the Buser was very friendly and smiling and very attentive came right away to the table and took my drink order. My server Charmaine greeted me with a warm smile and  suggested a few appetizers that were her favorite I choose the Spinach Artichoke Dip it was very good. For dinner I had the half rack of ribs it was so good. The service was outstanding and everything was fantastic, I never had to ask for drink refills Steven was definitely on top of everything and Charmaine checked on me a few times to make sure everything was good. She asked if I would like dessert but I was so full that I said I will be back and the overall service from everyone was outstanding. I will definitely be coming back. It's a great place to hang out and enjoy."}
{"text":"My dad and I have been here three times now!  The first time we stopped in for lunch.  The service was great!  The food was delicious.  We ordered the giant pretzel for an appetizer.  They do not lie, that thing is HUGE!  We would both recommend trying it.  The next time we stopped in, we went for breakfast.  We are originally from the Midwest, so biscuits and gravy is a staple for us.  Their biscuits and gravy is absolutely delicious.  Again, we had great service.  Everyone there is so friendly!  The third time we went was to watch an NHL game.  We asked if we could sit inside and near a TV with the game on.  The hostess was so nice and gave us a choice of two tables.  Again, the food was great and the service was terrific!  Our waiter was joking around with us, the manager stopped and sat with us for a little while to talk.  Even if you are not a Pete Rose fan, you need to come in and check this place out!  The ceiling is decorated like a baseball, which is just neat in itself.  The food is stick to your ribs, home cooking delicious!  The service has always been superb.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game!  Service good as well as food, Big fan of Pete!  Nice addition to Vegas strip"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, easy to get into without a wait.  We went twice, the 1st night the service at the bar was off the chain w the two male bartenders.  The drinks were made correctly and tasted good.  Since the 1st night was a success we decided to go back the next night.  This time another bartender and the drinks were awful :(. We even specifically explained how the bartender from the first night made it, but she didn't even bother to ask that bartender that was actually behind the bar w her after I told her he was the one that made my wonderful drink the evening before."}
{"text":"This place was very comfortable for a bar! The whole place was filled with TVs, I promise you wouldn't miss a game from wherever your sitting. Lol.

Our server Nicholette was such a sweet heart & a great help! I'm not a beer person, but she got me samples of some beer to taste because I wanted a drink & didn't want to choose one I didn't like!

I recommend the carne asada fries. It was made to perfection for us. & the serving was pretty big for sharing with 2. They even have a all day happy hour list ."}
{"text":"Stopped by Pete Rose Good Service Shrimp, was great Good atmosphere , music  and vibe was mellow. Seating was quick"}
{"text":"Not good.   The worker in front told us it was happy hour.... when we finally sat down we were informed it was not!?  The beers were almost $10 and food was over priced and underwhelming.  The staff could tell we knew things were a little weak and actually blushed and apologized.   The girl who told us it was happy hour hid and took her break.   This place is horrible and just about everywhere else in Vegas is better."}
{"text":"This is a total rip-off.  The fried calamari was so greasy it was gross.  The drinks have almost  nothing in them.  A glass of wine has only a small amount of wine.  A premium tequila (over $14 )looked so small I sent it back and had them take it off the bill. Save yourself some time and headache and go somewhere else.  We're never coming back to this hole."}
{"text":"I personally did not eat here, but check out the place outside and took the picture. The hostess knew I was a fan and told us it was okay for us to take pictures inside and in front of the throne chair.  So thank you very much for letting us do so."}
{"text":"Wide selection of breakfast options and special requests cheerfully accommodated. Breakfast flatbread was big enough to share."}
{"text":"Great food. Had nachos, calamari, and cheesy poofs. Also great drinks. Fun atmosphere and cool decor. The entire staff were very attentive and friendly. Everybody in the restaurant seemed to be enjoying themselves."}
{"text":"Excellent cocktails!  Enjoyed the Cincinnati Bullet Rye Old Fashion!  
Great location and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've never experienced such terrible service, manager included. We had to ask 3 times for our beer, the food took 50 mins and still no beer. Another 30 mins after asking for the check. The manager told me he was busy also and had been bartending for 15 years. He was so livid with an attitude when he approached our tables I was in complete shock! We spent 2 hours here and only had 1 drink not because we didn't want more but because we couldn't get a server for the life of us. The manager needs a different profession. I was proud of my husband after he approached with such disrespect and attitude. I had to tell my husband to let me handle it because I knew he'd go off. Rude!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place because I like Pete Rose and I was excited to see what his new restaurant was all about. Came to watch the Game 5 of the World Series and have some dinner with a party of 8, including two kids and a baby.

The service was just awful. We waited so long for my little cousin's shrimp, his mom never got her fries or her soup, our drinks went dry frequently, the bill was a mess and included the tip for a party that was essentially 5 adults and 2 children. We weren't a difficult party. We didn't make any strange requests. I don't know why this was so difficult. 

The ceiling was painted like a baseball. That was cute. Naturally, there are tons of TV's so it's a great place to watch a sporting event. The chairs were comfy, but didn't move well on the floor. 

The food was only mediocre, so that coupled with the very poor service means I won't be back. Bummer. Pete Rose, your namesake deserves better than this poorly run establishment."}
{"text":"I don't think it's called PETE ROSE SPORTS BAR anymore ...but it's great for people watching and BLOODY'S!  Lacey made a yumma basil jalapeño bloody that I lovedddd!!!  Thanks Lacey!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly. Food came quick. The side salad was okay. We ordered the Nachos with Steak and a chicken quesadilla. It was nothing out of this world but did the job in filling our bellies with some much needed food at the time."}
{"text":"Wow. I called over to see if they were showing a hockey game, in broken English, the person who answered the phone advised me that they were showing football, baseball, hockey, and any other games we wanted to watch.
I asked what baseball games are showing since the World Series has just ended and there are no games, she responded back with all of them.
Highly disappointed to call a bar that is considered a sports bar and even has the word sports in the title and have the person who answers the phone not know what games are on, what season games are being played in, or no names of teams if you ask if they're going to be on TV.   
Based on this phone conversation with the person at the front, I'm definitely skipping this place. I can understand the other reviews about poor service and overpriced drinks. They have a great location but, it seems that they fail on every other aspect"}
{"text":"The service was spectacular!  The chicken tacos made me happy dance!  Then tried my sis' fish and chips and was blown away.  Totally recommend this to any visitors!"}
