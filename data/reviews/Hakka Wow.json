{"text":"Spring rolls are good but the Singapore noodles are really terrible. Was expecting better."}
{"text":"WOW food for sure! everything we ate here was so good! very neat & nice ambiance as well. definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I am so glad that I tried this place for Hakka food. Staff was very friendly and helpful. They maintained spice level as per our need. Quantity was also more than enough. Show stealer was the vinegar dipped chopped green chillies which reminded me of the authentic street side hakka food in india. I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I entered this place expecting another run of the mill hakka place but my perspective was changed as soon as i stepped in the door. We went in the evening and the place had great ambience. The staff was very warm and sat us on a table right away. Before I knew it, we had water and the menu's on the table. We ordered the Garlic Chicken pakoora and the chicken lolipop as starters. I must say, both were excellent! Not oily at all and just the right spice. The portions are very generous as well!   For our main, we ordered the chilly fish which was prepared quickly and is probably the tastiest hakka fish dish I've ever tasted!  The owner was very polite and cared about our experience! Would definitely recommend this place to anyone!   Hakka WOW!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! We had dry chili paneer, Manchurian pakoras, and veggie chowmein. Great flavors, nice people. Wasn't too crowded for a Friday night but this place definitely rivals any downtown Hakka joint. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"So good! Ordered on Uber Eats - hot garlic chicken pakoras, dry chili chicken, shrimp in lobster sauce, chicken/beef/shrimp chow mein. Came with a surprise two orders of steamed rice. Thought was put into this food and flavouring. This is NOT the cheap oily Chinese/Hakka delivery food the price would suggest. Hakka Wow is right! I'll be coming back for sure. Kudos to Uber Eats for the assist!"}
{"text":"Wow crispy beef!!!  Hakka hakka!!  Mixed veggie was also great --the tofu was light  and tasty.    Waddling out happy and full."}
{"text":"WOW for sure, amazing Hakka food in GTA! Best Vegetable soup in town. Best place to eat while in Gerrard and good service!  Chill Chicken Dry Vegetable Soup  Vegetable Noodle  Chilli Paneer"}
{"text":"The Bombay fish was good and will made , and the crispy chicken was tasty. I would go hear again in the near future."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Waited 1 hour and 45 minutes for delivery. When we called to inquire they had no reason and no apology just saying \"the driver will be there soon\" and actually hung up.  There are alot of other places to choose from with better tasting food and better service. I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Large portions. The taste was Okay. Lots of sauce. Good for take out meals. One dish is probably enough for two people."}
{"text":"I now live in the neighbourhood, popped in for the first time for lunch, awesome! Got their Manchurian vegetable special and was so pleased by everything!  WOW serves one of the BEST hot and sour soups in the city!  The main dish was full of lots of fresh vegetables, super tasty spicy gravy, and plentiful!  As good if not better than Simon's Wok down the street (though Hakka Wow is by no means vegan, they have lots of vegan options)  I will be coming here a lot!  Must try!"}
{"text":"First time I went there I actually liked the food. Second time, not as much... This time, the chicken was slightly pink and the food completely flavourless. I ate a few bites of it. Then a few more with more sauce just to make sure. About 98% was left. I told the staff I didn't like it. One server nodded and told me \"yes, its less flavourful than (another dish)\". The second asked me whether I want my food packed. I said no, that I didn't like it at all. I was genuinely disappointed that I didn't like it. I really wanted tasty chinese food. No request to remake my food or bring me something else. Last time I visit."}
{"text":"This four star rating is for the veggie Manchurian pakoras (balls) in gravy. They are fried pakoras drenched in a sauce that is salty, savoury, spicy and addictive! We have had this dish in many Hakka restaurants and Hakka Wow makes one of the best. We have tried some of their other dishes (paneer in chili sauce, crispy noodles with veggies and manchurian sauce) that were good/average."}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I had really good Hakka Food. This place blew my taste buds away. That Crispy Beef is amazing, it is a must try for anyone that comes to this place. The food was fresh and delicious and service was amazing as well. Would recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Wow what a change! This place was actually good once upon a time and now it's just there.   We entered into a completely empty space and were to only two people the whole time. I can tell from the service that they are trying but their food is failing them. Having read a few reviews to see what's new, I tried their Hot Garlic Chicken and it was okay. But the Veg. Chowmein and Chilly Chicken were so disappointing. The first time I had this they had plenty vegetables in it, red pepper, green pepper and now onions alone seem to be the replacement. The taste too has suffered.   Seems like they've lowered their standards due to lack of customers, sad."}
{"text":"Tried this food place today at the Gerrard street festival of south Asia. Ordered the meat dish with rice. The rice was the cheap type. Then the guy put a sad amount of rice and little meat. It was so little but such a hot sunny day. The staff seemed friendly so I didn't want to argue with them. I paid the $7 and left.  Food itself was decent but the quantity was very lacking. They could easily have doubled the amount of food.  Finally, I'm dissapointed. Will not buy their food again..if you want to try food there are other places in the festival charging similar prices but giving way more."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. Food was not very flavourful and I won't likely order again. Paid extra for special crispy noodles with the chop suey and didn't even receive any crispy noodles at all so I was left with just the suey, no chop. Didn't even eat it. Most of this food was wasted."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Indian Chinese food so i thought of trying this place.Dishes served were in huge amount but chowmein was over spiced so much so that I have to take antacids after the meal.If an Indian is saying it's over spiced it means it's over spiced."}
{"text":"10/10 for the friendly staff and the food here is just delicious not forgetting the amazingly affordable prices. Can't wait to visit here again.  I would totally recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"Ordered through just eat and whoooo-eee, it was great. They send massive, massive portions for a really good price. We were having leftovers for almost a week. Everything was flavourful and delicious. We ordered a butter paneer, general tao fish, and crispy beef -- everything tasted great and they included lots of pieces of protein, not just veg. The sauces were all delicious."}
{"text":"I posted a review on Yelp after not receiving a food delivery order on New Years Night.  I was extremely disappointed and was not able to reach anyone at the restaurant for an explanation.  I was then contacted by the manager following the review and a voicemail.  I was provided with an honest explanation as to what had happened.  I respect people who take responsibility for minor mistakes. For this reason I will increase my rating on CUSTOMER SERVICE and give Hakka Wow another try."}
{"text":"As a fan of Hakka food, I thought I'd try Hakka Wow. Being in the heart of India town, I expected amazing food.  We were two, and we ordered a \"Bombay Chicken\", and a \"Szechuan Chicken\" both lacked the spice that you crave when going for Hakka.  The chicken was alright and the sauce was nothing to rave about.   Personally found the sauce to be a little too thick on both, and the lack of chicken was annoying.  The Chili oil was great, and added a much needed flavor boost to the meal.   Would I ever go there again, probably not.   Hopefully, I just went on a bad day.   Side note: we went during off-peak hours"}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of different hakka places but this one it at the bottom.   I saw the reviews and figured they had to be good, I mean they may had been good before but I would not recommend this to anyone now.  We ordered take out online. Everything was piping hot, which is always great. But what everything lacked was flavour. There was no salt in the Chili Paneer I ordered. And the Manchurian Veggie balls also lacked flavour and had little to no gravy. The Singapore Vegetarian noodles were very dry and the Vegetarian pakoras were possibly the only passible dish- but they too could have used a chutney.  Very disappointed with this hakka."}
{"text":"Oh man, the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce was such a beauty to behold!  There were many large succulent shrimps bathed in a dense lobster sauce.  The shrimps were already peeled too.  This was so good!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with the family for the first time as per Yelps recommendation. The chilli chicken had no flavour and the crispy beef was chewy. Been to much better Hakka places"}
{"text":"WOW.  We came after a day at beach volleyball, a group of 10. We didn't have a reservation. It was between lunch and dinner time, so they were fairly empty and able to accommodate our group. We got about 7 dishes, a rice and a noodles to share. The food was delicious! They servers were fairly on point about spice levels and tastes and sizes, which was great. The best part was, splitting all those dishes amongst a big group, we ended up paying about $10 each and it was a large variety of dishes. AWESOME! 10/10 would return."}
{"text":"Having had the best hakka in India, I think this is one of the worst hakka I have had in Toronto. The taste was mediocre and service was too. I asked the host to give me more chilly sauce and he refused to give me more than 2 although I orger more than 4 dishes. I also asked what noodles in the hakka noodles (my kid has an allergy to wheat) and neither the host nor the cooks were able to give me an answer."}
{"text":"What a great meal at Hakka Wow. In the heart of the Indian Bazaar. The service is friendly. The food service itself is a little slow.   Came during the week for lunch. We ordered the garlic pakoras as out apps. My goodness, the sauce on them, spicy and sweet. I couldn't get enough! Highly recommend those.  The hot and sour soup is always a hit or miss in my experience and this time it was well done, very spicy. I got the chili chicken as my main and it was very saucy. If you like your chili chicken with gravy to be very saucy, then by all means go for it. It was very delicious and not too salty. Of course there was a ridiculous amount of rice to fill you up. The rest of my group got the Bombay chicken. They were impressed and said it was like a creamy tandoori sauce.   They also have the Pakistan style Popsicles (kulfi?) and they were extremely sweet and velvety.   Would definitely visit again. 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Good luck getting your food.... ordered fold at 9pm. Waited patiently cause it was raining figured maybe driver was slow cause of the roads. Finally after 90 minutes.. I called to wonder whete food was... person said they would find out and call me back. Waited 10 minutes... called them back. Then got hung up on. Called agai. I was I formed that the food was ready but the driver said he wasn't going to do any more deliveries.. I asked to speak the the manager who apparently just stepped out... They politely said they weren't going to charge me for the food which is great considering I never recieved it. Starving .. dissapointed and understandably furious. Could have let me know. Had to chase them down to find out in not eating. Good job. Handled so poorly ."}
{"text":"UBER EATS ORDER ONLY: I ordered on a whim through Uber Eats the Chicken Tika Fried Rice, Crispy Beef, and Manchurian Chicken. All dishes were incredible and really surprised me as I was partly expecting a more Americanized greasy spoon experience - it was far from it. All there dishes had very generous sizes of chicken and beef, far more than you would expect from other Indian or Chinese restaurants. The portions were also great for the price.   I cannot judge this place on service or the actual restaurant outside of the food.   I will definitely be reordering and will pop in the next time I'm in the neighbourhood to try the restaurant."}
{"text":"Gerrard street was missing a good Hakka joint, well the wait is over. Hot and sour soup was well garnished and spiced Chicken Manchurian had the right taste and serving size was adequate Chicken chow mien was thicker than usual, but was very much on point"}
{"text":"Great food.  Had Mumbai chicken, Popcorn chicken, veg pakora.  Others in our party of 3 had the veg corn soup, veg fried rice and paneer.  Busy restaurant, efficient waitress - a little slow on refilling water glasses."}
{"text":"Hakka Wow? More like Hakka Meh. Unless you're talking about the amount of MSG. In which case, Wow! That's a lot of MSG."}
{"text":"Solid place, generous portion size.  Amazing out of this world veg Pakoras, the best in the city in my opinion.  Price is decent, with no liquor license so the keep that in mind  Tested and true for a nice informal diner with great flavors and portion size"}
{"text":"Tourists in town- made our way into the \"Indian bazar\" section of Toronto looking for late night dinner.  Really just strolling around and picked Hakka wow as it looked busy for 10pm but not crushed like some of the other places nearby.   Very Bare bones, no frills atmosphere. No beer or wine (no tea either)   fairly slow but friendly service.  Amazing food though.  We got vegetarian hot and sour soup and it tasted super crisp and fresh - it was the perfect balance of super spicy w a raw jalepeno pepper flavor, mixed w a strong black peppercorn flavor, but not overwhelming the other flavors in the soup. Great dish.   Veggie spring rolls were fine. (Spring rolls are only ever one of three things: Magic, Fine or sad.)  Crispy beef was a BIG hit w the carnivores. Looked good even to my vegetarian eyes. Clean crispy lightly sauced w veggies and sesame seeds.   Also got the crispy Sichuan veggie chow mein. Very different from what chow mein in the states is (which is usually a sad grey plate of liquified bean sprouts and overcooked onions served over deep fried wheat sticks they call noodles but are more like small sticks of mouth piercing death) THIS ON THE OTHER HAND was neither sad nor grey. It would've been called a pan fried noodle Dish at home, crispy pan fried yellow wheat noodles topped with a richly sauced pile of fresh veggies. It was amazingly not spicy despite its dangerous red oil look, (in fact after blowing out our tastebuds with the soup, it was almost on the bland side). Still really enjoyed it.   All in all a great meal, everything fresh and well prepared. Would come back if we weren't going to be 600 miles away for the rest of our lives."}
{"text":"I ordered 6 things for delivery: veg pakoras, dry, Manchurian; Thai green curry veg; Manchurian eggplant; spicy garlic veg; veg lemon soup; mango salad.  It all arrived promptly and hot, but no cutlery, which is ok with me.  the spices on the dry veg Manchurian were excellent, but the more I ate, I realized these weren't pakoras -- they were wheat battered veg. pakoras are made from chickpea flour. I called WOW, they were very nice and I explained that I wrote NO WHEAT in comment box. they told me there was no wheat in the batter. I asked what was in the batter then? I heard him ask the cook and finally reply, it's wheat. too bad since now I'll be ill and that was the best flavoured dish.  Thai green curry -- STAY AWAY! no curry paste, no basil, no galangal, no ginger, NO FLAVOUR except for gelatinous which counts as a flavour when excess and unnecessary cornstarch is used as was here. plus, it was all carrots, celery, okra. who wants those veggies to make up 100% of a curry? couldn't eat it.  eggplant Manchurian -- SUPER BLAND. Manchurian is supposed to have chilli paste, onion, coriander. this was cornstarch thickened soy sauce. ugh.  broccoli mixed veg spicy garlic -- NICE FLAVOUR, BUT ONLY 3 PIECES OF BROCCOLI. the rest was celery, carrot, baby corn and 4 snow peas.   Veg Lemon Soup -- GROSS. it was pure cornstarch. I could have done arts and crafts with it. flavour ok, but not spicy as indicated. couldn't eat it. there was also something in it which anaesthetized my throat but I have no idea what it was.  I feel like crying after spending $60 so I haven't tried the mango salad yet.  I've been in India and had Hakka which was wonderful, with proper Manchurian. this was so sad, unless you want wheat balls in dry Manchurian called pakoras, cuz those were good here."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are definitely a good way to go.  I've definitely had better chili chicken, this was more breading than actual meat.  The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Damn. This place is good. Seriously. Best Hakka I've had.  - not greasy - good heat - flavourful  We ordered, tandoori rice, crispy beef, garlic chicken pakora, chicken & shrimp chow main spring rolls and everyone loved it. You should go."}
{"text":"Very friendly, attentive staff and a nice addition to the neighbourhood.  The lunch special was excellent value and enough for leftovers, and the hot and sour soup was great.  I'm no expert on the cuisine, so it tasted pretty Chinese to me, but I was still quite happy and will definitely head back."}
{"text":"Very average food.  Place is clean and nice, especially for the areas full of dives.  But being in Toronto's \"Little India\" (the city of Toronto, not Brampton), I had much higher expectations from the food. It tasted like someone was reading the ingredients from a cooking book, no authenticity.  Our party of four had vegetable pakoras, red curry, biryani dish, chop suey and lemon chicken.  Everything tasted bland, although the ingredients were fresh.  The pakoras were probably the tastiest dish.  The food lacks a punch, spice (not hotness), maybe some of that fat-induced creaminess and fullness."}
{"text":"Pretty good! I'm not in the area often, but we found ourselves here for dinner after helping a friend hunt for an Indian-esque wedding dress next door. Overall, this place is slightly better than alright. Portion size is more than decent, service is very friendly, and while the interior and décor is pretty basic and almost diner-esque, it's still pretty clean. Plus, the prices are reasonable and it looks like they have lunch specials too.   We ordered Veggie Pakoras, Butter Chicken, and Crispy Beef. Overall, not bad and totally acceptable. Everything was piping hot and fresh, and the pakoras were nice and crunchy. The beef was a little undercooked, but I guess some people like eating it that way, and the butter chicken was tasty (not authentically tasty, but seasoned and made well).  Not a bad experience at all - if you're in the area, it wouldn't hurt to stop by at least once! It also looks like they get many take-out orders."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken pankora, wow special chow mien, and Manchurian chicken with gravy!   Love the chicken dishes, both are delicious. I found the noodle a bit plain, didn't find it too special. Portion is great and service was nice too! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Ordered in for my birthday -- feast for 5. Amazing! Flavourful, fresh, good value, large portions. Something a bit different from anything that I've had. Ordered online and the order was on time (even a wee bit early) and hot. I read a lot of reviews and made sure to order what sounded like the best dishes, like chicken pakora and crispy beef. This definitely will become my family's \"go to\" order-in place. Also, it can be hard to please everyone in our family, from my 89-year-old mother who doesn't really like spicy food anymore, to our 20-year-old non-adventurous-eater boy. All five of us LOVED everything."}
{"text":"I have yet to see the wow.    It's not for a lack of trying.  We've ordered multiple times from here, delivery, take out and in house.   But it's always been pedestrian average.   I don't quite know why.  It seems like they often seem to rely on heavy sauce to convey flavour rather than other methods.  A caveat.  Most people I speak with really like this place.  So many in fact that it leads me to believe that I'm wrong with my opinions thus far.   So we'll probably keep trying it.   But hopefully have better experiences.  It's not terrible.   And it comes fast."}
{"text":"The general Tao wasn't the greatest had a bad experience. Over priced, very little chicken one piece of broccoli. Bad customer service, didn't greet us."}
{"text":"Just ordered food from this restaurant through Uber eats.  I ordered:  - Chili chicken with gravy Nothing to write home about...could definitely use a lot more flavour. - Veg noodles Decent..tasty but could also use more flavour. - Crispy Beef Tender pieces of beef however the sauce was way on the sweeter side. - Hot & Sour Chicken soup Very generic bowl of soup with tofu & a few pieces of chicken.  I've been to quite a few Hakka places in Toronto and these guys definitely are up against some serious competition. I had to use my own hot sauce & soya sauce to add flavour.  Overall, not bad but not a place I'd order from again."}
{"text":"Service is really slow and the shrimp was way over cooked. Would not recommend. Food had no taste. Staff was friendly otherwise."}
{"text":"Good food, good portions, good value and flavour.  Ordered take away on New Year's Eve. Food was on time, piping hot.  Ordered the chili chicken with gravy, crispy beef, butter paneer, and veggie pad Thai.  The chili chicken was just enough heat and swimming in gravy sauce (if you like that).  The crispy beef was nice, bit chewy pieces but good flavour, needed more heat though.  The pad Thai was good and the container was packed so much it was double what we expected. Good flavour and they had peanuts in the side.  The butter paneer was a real winner. Rich sauce, cubes of paneer in stick shape was a nice change. Slight heat but easy on the oil.  Most of these dishes were not overly greasy or oily, a nice change if pace for both Indian or Chinese food.  Overall, good value for money.  Make sure you order online and not on the phone for a decent discount and ensure accuracy (they said they prefer it for managing their orders)"}
{"text":"Ordered last night the chicken Manchu Rian rice and chili chicken, both were delicious."}
{"text":"The wait was long only had an hour lunch food blan probably won't go there anymore only if no choice."}
{"text":"Ok this is legit Hakka. Best I've eaten around gta so far. Less greasy, fresher flavour. Order often through just eat. On time delivery. Egg fried rice, soups, chicken dishes, pakoras - everything has been good. Plus since I'm ordering often they sent a whole complimentary dish! Nice. Only recommendation would be to tone down the cornstarch in some dishes a tad. Recommend!"}
{"text":"We ordered 3 dishes, 1 was good, 1 was just ok, and 1 was barely edible.  The good: fish pakora, no compaints  The just ok: chicken fried rice, it was quite bland, seemed to be missing some seasoning but otherwise ok  The barely edible: the sweet and sour chicken, the best way I could describe the sauce was watery ketchup that had gone bad. Despite this normally being a flavourful dish, it was also quite bland, and on top of that the chicken was a very weird texture to the point where I wasn't entirely sure if it was safe to eat or not.  Overall, I was not impressed and will not be going back there."}
{"text":"Well, I have to say I will come back here always for the hot garlic chicken pakora. those are some divine flavour infused balls of addictingly  good chicken.  the rest of the food is good too but this app is just a mind blower.  other recommendation: -shrimp in lobster sauce. damn! strong flavour, but might be a bit tough to eat"}
{"text":"The food is wow!! I am definitely coming back. I was craving for chicken lollipop for so long this place played justice!!!"}
{"text":"Hakka wow deserves it's wow name.   food: delicious. I've always loved pakora but I've only ever experienced the veggie stuff so when I hit to try the chicken one with sweet chili sauce I was blown away by the deliciousness. It comes with a spicy ginger sauce but I asked for something less spicy and they gave me the sweet chili. I ordered the rice noodles hakka style with shrimp and chicken,  Bombay chicken and chili fish. All were delicious. We got \"gravy\" for the chicken and fish dishes, which is really just another name for sauce and it was delicious. It was just the right amount of spicy and had some generous portions (both these dishes were about 10.88). They came with one bowl of rice for us to put the sauce on top. the noodles were amazing and not very greasy or oily, I felt the cuisine was delicious.   The service was very nice and our waitress kept asking us if we liked it all quite often. However the service was a bit slow and the food didn't come out all at the same time (if that's something you're nit picky about).   We went on a Friday night but it was maybe a third full but I suspect they do a lot of take out (saw a lot of take out bags).   All in all, for the quality and the price, I definitely recommend this place to eat over the others.  Cor four people, we spent about $60 -not too bad!"}
{"text":"Great place , bright , clean , friendly service and Great food. This was My first visit and I had The lolipop Chicken which was delicious and also had the chili chicken all entrees come with rice so that was a nice surprise. Endless supply of water waitress was very attentive making sure water glasses were full . Definitely would go again maybe tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"This was the first time to try this place since they opened.  The atmosphere was clean, light and spacious. The service was friendly and accommodating. The lollipop chicken and dry chili chicken were both delicious.   My partner and I had mixed opinions on the chicken pakora.  We both agreed that it would have been even better with more meat and less batter.  However we both agreed it had good flavor.  He wouldn't order it again but I would.  We will definitely return. It is a nice treat to have in the neighborhood."}
