{"text":"Pizza is a misnomer.... it should be called Loft BEER... this place is kinda ridiculous because its SO Cheap to have a beer here. They always seem to have a deal on something (Bud Light or Miller or whatever). Every time I come back to Ohio I end up at the loft in one of the wooden booths drinking a LOT of beer here, and I almost never can even get to the credit card minimum!  Great place to just relax and have a drink."}
{"text":"Heavy emphasis on the \"dive\" in dive bar. Don't even know if I'd rank it high enough to be considered a dive bar. I think the only reason they're still popular is because they have a functioning juke box and people follow the tradition of starting off here (probably to get it out of the way) once they turn 21 in Kent. Also for you 21 yr olds from out of state, get ready to either be denied, or maybe if you're lucky, have them ask you to \"pull up your Facebook to match your ID\" (because that's a solid way to check an ID right?). Extremely rude bouncers, they will not give you a second if they think your ID isn't you even if you're a regular. Truly hate this place and hope it either gets new management that treats customers like human beings or closes down. They really know how to make someone feel unwelcome even after I've given them my business countless times."}
{"text":"The loft was the best pizza ever and on Tuesdays and Saturdays you could get a medium with pepperoni for $3. But alas, they are no longer serving pizza from the basement of The Loft (unless it's started up again). They were selling slices from a cart on weekends after midnight but I'm old now and haven't been downtown Kent to know if they're still doing it.  Please let me know if they are - I'd stay up late to get some of that pizza again!!"}
{"text":"This woman bouncer with the glasses let us in to the bar after kicking out our friend refusing to swipe her ID when she's actually 22 and offered multiple forms of ID, and after letting us get our drinks, kicked us out, screaming profanities at us to get the f*** out claiming we were underage, which would mean they are okay serving underage patrons, until the police came and asked us for ID proving we were of age from various forms including credit cards, debit cards, Kent student ID's, and even an Ohio Sales ID that requires a fingerprint to even obtain. This is possibly the worst bar encounter I've ever had in my three years at Kent State. Absolutely awful place to experience Kent."}
