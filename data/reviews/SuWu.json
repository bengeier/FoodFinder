{"text":"Came to this place at around 1AM with my group of friends. The music was awesome. Everyone was singing and dancing. The crowd was mainly 20-30yr olds. The drinks were probably the best part about this place. The decor made the place look cute and comfortable even though we had only gone in for the nightclub. The ratio, however was about 4 males to 1 female. I felt like men were praying on any girl that didn't have a guy next to her."}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times. Both very disappointing. The first time I went to Su Wu was no long after they opened. Went there for dinner. Fries are really good, the rest of the food in the menu is TERRIBLE. I ordered tacos and I couldn't even eat them because they were disgusting. 

This weekend I went here again because I wanted to give it another try, since maybe the lunch menu would be better. I sat there for 20 minutes and they didn't even bring us the menu. NOTHING. I looked at the waitress a couple times. She looked back at me. But she was too busy talking with some friends on another table. Not coming back here ever again."}
{"text":"Food: Came here for brunch, surprisingly good I must say! Although overall everything was a tad saltier, but the food exceeded my expectations for sure from what I considered only a bar/lounge. The brunch items are original and the hashbrowns are amazing, crunchy on the outside and soft inside and comes in a pie-piece shape~

Service: Very friendly

Price: Reasonable

Ambiance: The ambiance deserve a special mention, I LOVE it! The wooden furniture, the bar, the lights, the cozy feel, perfect for a lazy Sunday morning to come enjoy a nice meal."}
{"text":"Nice staff, trendy crowd, good music, overall good ambiance, food and cocktails are ok"}
{"text":"First bar I ever visited in my life, the employees were super nice! I wasn't a huge fan of my drink, because the minty taste was way too strong for me. Although, it was fun and there was a great atmosphere for a Friday evening! I went to this bar around 6pm and my drink was half price (around 6$). Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Suwu is a refreshing new addition to the plethora of annoying bars along st. Laurent. It's along the lines of furco and sparrow. Nice antique detailing, plants and pretty lighting :) and good music! The cocktails are tasty and they even offer a $4 beer - not bad! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Drinks are seriously overpriced, as in: more expensive than the Ritz or other hotel lounge (10$ for a beer!). Typical unfriendly wait staff, for which Montreal hip bars are so well known, 20-something crowd, playing above their pay grade, beautiful plants, but the atmosphere lacks a spark of genuine idiosyncrasy or spirit or whatever. Maybe it's your crowd; wasn't mine."}
{"text":"Bar lounge sur Saint Laurent qui change des autres bars autours
Musique Hip Hop!
Bière Suwu a 4 dollars! Cocktails qui changent!
Ambiance trentenaire et In de Montréal. Un des endroit ou il faut être en ce moment!
Ils font des petits accompagnement assez sympa style tacos aux boulettes de veau! Brochette de mozzarella pané! ect.
Arrivé assez tôt pour avoir une place assise!
Déco très sympa!"}
{"text":"Many people have given Suwu rave reviews, and I'd like to agree but this place has literally the worst service I've ever encountered. 

My first time at Suwu it took an hour to get our food after ordering, and my eggs benedict came STONE COLD. No one wants cold hollandaise, ever. 

The second time I went to Suwu, I vowed for no food, and only bottomless mimosas. We were seated after 30 minutes, and then were told we couldn't order drinks from a server because he wasn't assigned to our table. I didn't see one other person \"working\" if thats what they think they're doing. 

I love the atmosphere, and I understand why people like this place, but seriously, bad service is pathetic."}
{"text":"Good location, good (strong) drinks and an interesting food menu, can we ask for better? I've been going to Suwu for a few years now and it's honestly one of my favorite spots...I've never left unhappy! Service is a little slow though...even on nights when there isn't a large crowd.

Although Suwu is more of a bar/lounge than a restaurant, I wouldn't refer to they're food menu as \"pub food\". The ingredients they use are obviously fresh, not ALL fried and not drenched in salt/salsa.  Their salads are yummy and interesting and they're desserts are heavenly. What I love about Suwu is they usually offer a special meal and cool drink weekly - so there's always a chance to try something new. Did I mention ALL they're drinks are cool? 

If you're in the mood for intimate drinks with a friend, I would suggest going on a weeknight for their 5-7. Friday and Saturday evenings are great but JAM PACKED. If you like a loud/vibrant ambiance then weekends are for you."}
{"text":"The bar quickly became a favorite on my trip to Montreal from its music, decor, reasonable prices, and overall vibe. It gets very crowded here and the service staff isn't the most friendly, but still deserving of a 4 out of 5."}
{"text":"Always treated the best! Love the cocktails, beer and apps every time :) Not to mention the amazing ambiance!"}
{"text":"Great bar with great bartenders, everyone seems to be having fun, hoegaarden on tap - really good hang over brunch food and huge windows that open out onto the street, gets crowded at night so beware

We had their version of egg in a basket which was delicious and the creton is very good too - lady friend had the banana bread and salmon bagel which she really liked.

I thought the prices were very reasonable and I can't believe someone complained about the endless 35$ mimosa - so cheap and so good.

We came a few times before we went out and they had a DJ playing off-the-beaten-path electronic and a young diverse crowd. 

Definitely a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came during the week, just for drinks. Both of our drinks were delicious. A little pricy, but not crazy expensive. Good old school hip hop vibes going on with a nice decor."}
{"text":"Loud music with shitty speakers. I mean really bad speakers. But good music though. The drinks were decent. Crowd tends toward the younger side. Go if you are in your early twenties, otherwise skip this place."}
{"text":"Terrible Service. Incompetent Staff.

This place was once my favorite brunch spot, but in recent months it has gone down hill. I was told that I couldn't have what I ordered because the kitchen didn't feel like making it; the waitress later made a joke about how inattentive she'd been despite NOT being busy.

Sure, the food is pretty good, but I'd rather be treated as a customer rather than an inconvenience."}
{"text":"I've never had service this good! Honestly, our waiter was amazing and very easy on the eyes. We went on a Friday night, Jan 17th, just before happy hour was ending. He told us we had about 5 mins left to get drinks half off, some were only $5! So we ordered one drink each at first, then decided to order another to make it before the cut off time. The waiter gave us recommendations on drink to order which were very good! When he came to take our food order, I ordered the soup and poutine and he warned me that it would be too much for me, so I just ordered the poutine which was good and plenty, the waiter was right! I also had some of my boyfriend's lobster roll which was soooo delicious, we ended up trading our meals with each other. 

Nonetheless, we gave the waiter a nice tip and were on our way. I will definitely go back to SuWu for my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"After dropping a significant amount of money (multiple drinks, a tray of shots for our group and surrounding people, generous tips etc), a small unattractive 19 year old child who works at this establishment (who was off duty and drinking with friends), shoved a member of my party with all her strength to pass. He was irritated because it caused him to spill his drink and held his ground which in the end ended up moving her out of the way. She proceeded to shove him even harder, and then got one of the barmen to get the doorman and kick out group of 5 out of the bar while she laughed with her equally unattractive and immature friends. The barman who was serving us apologized (we'd been generous with him, and are a well off group in our late 20s early 30s). The barman who was in cahoots with this woman-child made an incredibly sexist statement to my friend by saying that she is a woman and is allowed to shove him, and also that she works here so she can do what she wants. This is unacceptable. I have been to this place multiple times, and have always enjoyed my evening, as well as spent a lot on drinks. She should not continue to work with the public if she is using her \"status\" as a bar waitress to be rude and obnoxious. The owner of this bar should realize that having such an employee is detrimental to their establishment and she shouldn't be allowed to interact with the public. Having worked in the public sector for many years, her attitude is not one I would accept as an owner or manager. Hopefully she will soon be out of a job, however if she isn't, she can continue her \"career\" cleaning up after bar patrons who have real jobs."}
{"text":"Cool place. Food is very good, love the atmosphere and location. The owners are cool guys, would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Very hipster atmosphere. 

I was there for saturday brunch and the service was very good. Poached eggs on the Tartare de Saumon were perfectly cooked. Everything was nice UNTIL, right before leaving, the waiter took our water glasses for no reason. When we asked for more water, he brought us new cups containing luke-warm tap water. Despite that last slip-up, it was a very enjoyable brunch."}
{"text":"I've come here for brunch several times - and had pretty different experiences with the food. The first time I came, they had really cool menu selections - the fried chicken and French toast with blueberry buttermilk sauce was really good. Another time that I came though, the menu items were kind of average, such as peanut butter and jelly or a mcmuffin- and it tasted pretty average as well, which made me feel like it was a little overpriced for what they served. I think it really depends, because they change their menus once in a while. 
I feel like I mainly come for the ambience - there's really cool art drawn on the counter, and the restaurant is filled with plants which give it a very lovely atmosphere. 

I've come here at night for drinks once, and I really love the atmosphere at night too! It's very laid back and there's great music playing too. I was debating between the apple bottom drink and the Wu tang, and the server recommended the Wu tang, which I really enjoyed! It was sweet and tangy, and didn't taste too strongly of alcohol. I tried my friends' drinks as well, and the apple bottom was pretty good as well. I thought the mamacita (not sure if that's the correct spelling) was very ... Interesting. There was cilantro in it, so it had a very sharp? (Not sure which word to use) taste - I wouldn't recommend it but maybe it's just me. 
My friend tried their chocolate cake with Guinness (for only $4) and he enjoyed it as well! 
It was definitely a lovely place to just relax and chill, and the servers were very friendly as well.
Will probably go back for drinks again ! (And brunch too but after I check their menu)"}
{"text":"Came to Suwu for brunch. The inside of the place looks super nice with plants sand lighting. The ambiance is a 10. Music is a 10. A lot of 90s hip hop staff is polite and friendly. 10. The food was good. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Parfois une bonne impression peut se jouer à des choses simples et une brève expérience. À la recherche d'un peu de chaleur par un jour de mai (gris), j'ai décidé d'aller payer un verre à ma blonde dans cet endroit dont l'intérieur m'avait déjà tapé dans l'oeil.

On s'installe nous-même à une table libre car la (souriante) serveuse est seule et un peu débordée. Surement à cause de l'happy hour qui vient de se terminer.. Ou pas vraiment, puisque pour la légère attente elle nous permet d'en bénéficier quand même ! Un geste apprécié à sa juste valeur.. Nous avons donc pris un cocktail Panama club au rhum épicé et lait de coco.. bien équilibré et délicieux jusqu'à en lécher le verre presque (y a pas de plaisir sans honte..)

Bref dans Panama club, y a Panama : profiter d'un petit paradis sans trop payer.. BOUM ! Nous reviendrons..."}
{"text":"Myself and 10 of my friends went here for brunch while we were celebrating a bachelors party in Montreal. I'll make this review quick and simple. This restaurant was one of the highlight of our entire trip. The service was attentive and engaging and the food was excellent. I had the bacon egg and cheese on a bagel, and it was AMAZING. So good that we came back the next day and ordered the same thing. Great spot!"}
{"text":"The good points: great deal on happy hour cocktails, lots of plants and fancy lights! 

The less good.... The service staff seem like they dislike working there. Everyone seems in a bad mood to start, and as a customer I felt like an annoyance. Maybe it's annoying to work there? It seems like there might be some management or organization issues. In the two times, once I've had wait staff tell my party that I did not pay. I had been the first one to leave, and I did pay. Thankfully the waiter realized this eventually. This is based on my work colleagues' account of what happened.

The second time we went we waited a long time before having our waiter return to order more drinks. This was at 6:30pm on a Thursday. We had to wave down the wait staff. And they seemed annoyed. Or maybe they are just too cool?

Honestly, I wasn't a huge fan of the decor, although others seem to like it. Have we reached peak mason jar yet? I think if you're really into Pinterest you will like this bar. It is trendy, and apparently hyped? Not sure why."}
{"text":"Their decor is lovely and the staff very kind. Their cocktails are strong and delish. Definetely considering going back to try the food."}

Du bon vin, de bin mets (charcuteries, thon mariné...). Quelles saveurs!"}
{"text":"After three failed club attempts SuWu was the way to go. It offers the perfect mixture between cozy and fun. Although a little crowded the music choice was very danceable. Overall my experience here was genuinely pleasurable and fun! 10/10 recommend"}
{"text":"Bad service and the fried chicken quesadilla was horrible. No taste and they forgot numerous toppings. The chicken was All just fried batter. Bloody Mary was on point though"}
{"text":"(Brunch review) 

SuWu recently made over their food section of their brunch menu -- completely different. I tried the mcmuffin and it was ok, but definitely not worth $14. The sandwich itself tasted like a mcdonalds mcmuffin, and the hashbrown was way too greasy. It's a different hashbrown than the old menu, I'd suggest substituting for the potatoes.

There's definitely way better brunch places in town. It's a shame because their old menu was really great :("}
{"text":"Un peu caché derrière les plantes, c'est un des rares endroits du genre dans le quartier. On tombe sous le charme immédiatement avec le décor, les grosses banquettes, le nom des drinks, et le fameux pinball. Tip: il y a 50% sur les cocktails entre 5 et 7. Excellente raison d'en essayer plusieurs. La crowd apres le travail versus tard le soir le week-end est très différente. Je préfère plus tôt en soirée et pendant les games. Le menu a changé depuis l'ouverture, personnellement je préférais l'ancienne formule même si plus grasse avec des petits plats."}
{"text":"I recently had brunch at Suwu on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was pretty busy, but I had made a reservation for 12 people beforehand. The reason I chose to eat here was the fantastic atmosphere and decorations that they have in the restaurant. Vines, plants, and lights in mason jars hang from the ceiling. I ordered the smoothie of the day, which happened to be a strawberry blueberry smoothie, and this dish called chiquillos (I think that's what it was called). The menu is slightly different from what their website says. They frequently change their menu, so you're in for a surprise when you go for brunch there. The smoothie was delicious and was priced at $6 (kind of pricey). The chiquillos was melted cheese, guacamole, ground beef and tomatoes served over tortilla chips. It was delicious; however, the toppings were all placed towards one side of the dish so some of the tortilla chips didn't have much flavour to it. All of the items on the menu were reasonably priced ($10-$18). I tried some of my friends' breakfast potatoes. They weren't very impressive, so I would recommend not getting them. They were a bit too hard and weren't very crispy. My total meal came to around $20, which is a reasonable price for what I got. I am most likely coming back because they offer endless mimosas at the price of $35 which is a great deal!"}
{"text":"Trendy, Aesthetic Gem on St. Laurent - Great Music/ Atmosphere / Drinks  - Food was gastropub-ish/upscale bar food.  Staff was very accommodating for our group of 10+.  Crowded, but to be expected from this type of establishment.  Young Mature Crowd - not the 18+ group found in much of the neighborhood.  Get the Shwarma + the House Cocktails."}
{"text":"After reading a few of the reviews on here, I was a bit skeptical about the place. We decided that we still wanted to check it out because we love hip hop! When we got there around 9 pm the place was packed. There were no tables available but we put our name on the list, and went to have a drink at the bar. The cocktail list had a nice variety, and the names were really fun. My friend and I each had an \"old school\" which was bourbon, aperol and st germaine. It was delicious! We also ordered their ramen crusted chicken fingers and their special of the evening, fish and chips. Both dishes were fantastic!! The atmosphere was awesome too. Dim lighting, wooden decor and the BEST music. All the servers were extremely nice and the bartenders very attentive. I would 100% recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriends for drinks and had a great time. The ambiance is comfortable and chill; dim lights, mason jars, wooden furnishings and the likes. Small place but usually crowded so a bit noisy but that's how most bars are anyway. I only tried their drinks, not their food but I saw that they had an interesting menu for food as well. 

I tried the raspberry kush which was very minty/herbal (in Bengali/Hindi we call it Tulsi). Had a refreshing essence to it but not my favorite. I really liked my other drink which was smaller and more intense. I think it was called Wu-Tang. 

Best part of the place is that they have a DJ but it's not a dance place so the DJ is playing ambiance music. Really loved that.

Staff and service was smooth as well. I do feel that the place was too busy for their staff to handle but I assume that they are better on less crowded nights. 

Would recommend this place for chill night outs when you want to talk with your friends instead of getting wasted."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my new favorite bars-clubs in town. I loved every thing about it. The music is awesome (mostly RnB, Hip hop and top 40), there is no cover and the drinks are not really overpriced compared to other bars on the same street. The barmaids are quite nice as well.

One thing I liked the most was the green decor, absolutely gorgeous. It felt like a garden. The people are mostly young (18-25) and it can get pretty crowded, but there is just something about the vibe that this place gives off, I absolutely loved it! Would 100% recommend."}
{"text":"Un gros bof pour ce resto bar ! Premierement, la bouffe est beaucoup trop chere pour la qualité ! 

Deuxiemement , les portions sont minuscule ! Apres un repas a 50$ (par personnes avec drink) j'avais encore super faim !

Je ne vous suggere pas cet endroit ! Au nombre de bon restaurant dans le coins aller essayer un autre spot !"}
{"text":"I loved the decor! The place really had an interesting and unique look to it. I spent most of my time just looking around at the decor!

Service was great! Friendly waitress and we didn't have to wait long for our drinks and plates!

I ordered a cocktail called Brooklyn's Finest ( I definitely recommend it) as well as a plate of poutine. I did underestimate the poutine but it was actually quite good, especially considering that this is not a poutine place but a bar.

Overall, I would definitely recommend Suwu!"}
{"text":"Have been going religiously to Suwu at least once a week for the past 3 years.

Food:

Brunch - Bottomless mimosas for 35$, you can ask for different kinds of juices (grapefruit, pineapple, lychee), brunch menu is limited, but their home potatoes are to die for. Make sure you make a reservation if youre a big group.

Dinner- also a very limited menu as of recently, but everything is VERY good and at a reasonable price.

Although the menu has been very small lately, when asked, management has said that they will be rolling a more complete & bigger menu in June.

Bar:

Happy hour aka 2 for 1 drinks from 5-7 every day. Its hard to get the waiters attention at this time so we usually order 4 drinks at a time. 

Every night starting at 11 is usually when people start lining up to get into Suwu as a club. The music is amazing and the bouncers aren't sexist/racist in letting people in as many are in Montreal. The vibes are incredible. 2 for 1 shots on Wednesdays!

Finally, Sundays, they have a deal where all bottles of wine are 50% and if you dont finish one you can take it home.

You can't go wrong with Suwu!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Chill vibe, lovely decorations, really nice bartenders, yummy drinks. Get the Bloody Mary Caesar drink if you like your drink to double as a meal! We sat at the bar."}

{"text":"Loved this little restaurant. The small menu has really good options and everything we tasted was delicious. Recommend the poutine. Cocktails were good too! They had a two for one cocktail special while we were there. The vibe of the place is great. Beautiful greenery decor hanging from the ceiling."}
{"text":"The music was great. We loved the old school jams. I got great decorating tips from the place. The cocktails are amazing. Get the Elk Blood. 

Could have done without the people passing gas and walking away and the waitress who but her nails, applied lip gloss, and then touched the fruit for the drinks and the tops of the straws."}
{"text":"Was placed at a table at the door. Kept my jacket on because it felt colder then outside. Music was played LOUD. Couldn't understand the person sitting across from me. incomprehensibly low quality of food for a ridiculously high price. 
Went there for brunch and left after one bite of the \"breakfast poutine\". lukewarm potatoes on the outside, hot on the inside of the bowl. supposedly there should have been meat in the poutine, but all i could find were it's cremated remains. After trying to find the meat i did discover a puddle of grease at the bottom of the bowl. That caused me to be full already.  Also got served a cold espresso :|
After getting all of this, the hostess came by to ask us how everything was. We replied with \"bad\" and that we wanted the check. No question was asked about what was bad and no solution was offered to make it better. 
We paid the ridiculously high bill and left. 
We crossed the street to have a propper meal at Juliette & Chocolat."}

{"text":"This place has a VERY limited menu. But honestly, everything was delicious. I came with a bachelor party and ordered 1 of everything. No joke. Here are my suggestions:

1. Skip the Mac and cheese sandwich
2. Get the burger. Omg do effig good
3. Fish tacos were pretty good, nothing special 
4. Falafels aren't like normal ones, and the sauce that comes with it was really average. 
5. A large fries feeds 10 people. 
6. Fried chicken isn't a burger. Just strips of friends chicken. 

Worth a stop, I enjoys this place.  FYI patron shots are $7!"}
{"text":"I traveled to Montreal solo to kick off the new year. The spot I originally planned to hit up (Buillon Bilk) was closed because it was New Year's Day. So, I stumbled around like a lost puppy for a little bit and noticed this cool spot with a nicely lit up bar. Decided to check it out. I was sold after I took a look at the menu. Any bar that has a drink called The Purple Rain can have all my chedda. There's also a really yummy drink called The Miami Vice (or something like that...drinks were flowing so memory a little fuzzy!) I also had a small plate - think it was salmon tartare. Hip hop & R&B were in the backdrop - good vibes. Also, the bartenders were super friendly and gave me some other recommendations during my stay. Would def return when I make my way back to Montreal."}

Atmosphere was nice although it was a Sunday afternoon so I'm sure it's a hoping place later in the evening. 
Definitely worth checking out. 
No sign on the outside of the building making it a little more difficult to find. That adds another bit of secrecy to finding a cool spot."}
{"text":"I came to SuWu on two occasions, once for supper and another time for partying. I've passed this spot many times and took notice how nice the decor is with the wooden panels on the walls and plants everywhere. 

Good: When I came to party, I definitely enjoyed the hip hop music. I didn't care that there was only 5 other people dancing, I was ready to dance. However, they don't move the tables or chairs to clear some space, so it was a bit awkward to dance around in such a small space. My sister noted that the cocktails were pretty good, so I get why this place is so popular.

Bad : The hostess that sat us at the bar had asked us to move seats TWICE, one time to make space for another couple and then again because the corner she moved us to was blocking the waiters. Seriously, why would you put your patrons in a tight spot? Secondly, why is there even a seat if it blocks the staff? I don't recall any particular dishes that stood out in a good way, just the typical small portions not worth the price. I ordered one of their eggplant dishes, and it was so tasteless [no seasoning, nothing...] I just forced myself to eat it since the waiter never bothered to check up on us. 

Bottom Line : I wouldn't go back for dinner to be honest, maybe in the evening to go dancing."}
{"text":"We had a group of 6. Food was on point. Couple guys got the sandwich of the day. I got their burger. Everyone loved it. Decor is very unique and and the music they were playing was great. We will Go back for brunch most likely"}
{"text":"First off, this rating was an average taken from my two visits to SuWu. 

Visit #1:
I'm a sucker for rustic, hipster décor, so when I saw those wooden paneled walls, green filled space and the pendant light bulbs dangling, I told myself I would get my lazy butt there even through the midst of midterms. 

I dropped by with a friend on a Saturday evening at around 6pm expecting it to be pretty packed. However, it was surprisingly pretty empty and we got a first dibs on the seats. The waiter was attentive and patient so there wasn't an issue with the service. 

What I really had a problem with was how they didn't have half the things on the menu. I remember seeing some pretty interesting dishes and getting all pumped up to try them only to find out that none of them are available. I mean, why have a menu when you don't even have half the things? And keep in mind this is pretty early on into the night so I thought it was a bit weird that they're running out of things in the kitchen already. It got to a point where we simply asked the waiter what they do have and I ended up ordering a Philly steak sandwich and some rosemary fries. 

I'm usually not a meat person, but I have to say that was a meat sandwich that I would definitely eat again! The meat was succulent and I don't know what kind of witchcraft was going on in that sauce but it was divine...and I have to say, that steak sandwich was the only reason why I did decide to go back.

Visit #2
The second time was a Thursday evening and this place was jam packed and loud! I lost my voice by the end of the night trying to scream across the tiny table. Probably not the best first date experiences. 

This time around they changed everything on the menu! Personally, I think this time around, the menu didn't look as appetizing as the previous one. Most of the food items was fried or some sort. I ended up getting their poutine and my date got corn dogs. 

I thought my poutine was overpowered with the green onions. Definitely not the best I've had. Apparently the corn dogs were so dry and bland that he couldn't even finish them. For his first corn dog experience, I would say it did not end well. 

Conclusion:
They make a hell of a great Philly steak sandwich that would forever have a special place in my heart until I eat a better one. I would go back to simply enjoy décor and romantic ambience. But food wise, due to their inconsistency, I'll probably pass."}
{"text":"While I can't speak to what this is like after hours, I can say that this was a fantastic spot to stop for brunch.

There's no sign on the door, so this is the kind of place that if you don't know what you're looking for it, you won't find it. The decor was pretty cool - I'd say a hipster-fied west elm vibe. They open up all the front windows which lets in a nice breeze and makes it easy to people watch on St. Laurent. The music that they were playing was perfect for brunch. Fun, but not too dance party. I guess I'd say like laid back DJ music? 

We started with the fruit bruschetta, and while it was good I wouldn't necessarily order it again. For my main meal I ordered the egg in a basket. This was out of control good. A base of salty bread pudding with chunks of bacon, smothered with caramelized onions, portobello mushrooms, cheddar cheese, and an egg on top. Also, a pretty healthy side of hash browns. I want to say this was only $12 or $13 and regardless of how delicious it was I had trouble finishing more than half of it. Amazing food, great value. 

I felt like the drinks were kind of expensive compared to the food. $35 for bottomless mimosas is really steep (at least compared to the Miami standard of around $20 - where things always tend to be more expensive, not less). We ordered the Suwu house beer (not bad) and then I had a Raspberry Sage breakfast cocktail. It was pretty tasty, and I guess an OK deal for $9.

I loved the food and atmosphere enough to definitely make another stop in here the next time I'm in Montreal. 

A note about service: when the place started to fill up the service started slipping. They only had one poor waitress working brunch at 11am. Don't know if this is standard practice, but I might not expect anything other than a very leisurely Sunday brunch here."}

The only bar in the world that you can wait 40 minutes to get in and when you get in you can make eye contact with every bar tender at least 4 times and not get served and spend another 40 minutes to get a drink. On top of that the bartenders are rude when they process your order."}

J'ai eu l'impression d'entrer dans un endroit privé, où je n'avais pas le droit d'être. En entrant, on regarde moi et mon ami un peu de travers lorsqu'on demande où s'assoir. On nous répond \"binnn y'a d'la place au bar la\"
On se dirige vers \"le bar la\" pour ne pas se faire servir. On y est resté pendant près de 10min avec AUCUN service. Notez que notre serveuse était au bar à 5 pieds se nous. À un moment, elle prenait des shots au lieu de venir nous voir! 
Bon bin, santé!"}
{"text":"I came to Suwu bar looking for a tasty brunch to share with my boyfriend on Saturday but ended up leaving hungry and upset by the carelessness and haughty attitude of our waiter.

Both my boyfriend and I ordered an egg and avocado dish that had potatoes and toast as a side.  I informed the waiter I was unable to eat the toast as I have an allergy.

When our food arrived, both plates had toast and in addition to that, it seemed the potatoes were also coated in flour before being deep fried.   Occasionally wait staff does not understand my food allergy or makes a careless mistake because they are too busy, which I can let slide, but not what happened next.

When I asked my waiter to send the dish back to the kitchen and attempted to clarify what I can and cannot eat  he informed me that I couldn't have anything off their menu because everything is made with gluten (including their fruit salad, apparently).  He chided me for not making it more clear why I couldn't eat bread and diminished the seriousness of my food allergy by claiming health condition is 'actually just an intolerance,' which he said the kitchen staff informed him of.  Apparently neither the kitchen staff nor our blonde waiter has ever heard of celiac disease, which affects 1% of the North American population.

I would advise the management of Suwu bar to speak to their wait staff and cooks about the attitude of their employees as I'm certain anyone receiving service as we did will not be returning to eat (or drink) again.  I've been living in Montreal for 5 years now and this has been the worst service I've had in a restaurant with my autoimmune disease, hands down."}
{"text":"Bon endroit pour danser trash parmi la petite bourgeoisie montréalaise. Le décor est magnifique, très végétal.  Une fois environ 23h passée, les tables au centre de la pièce sont mises sur les côtés afin de faire de la place au danse floor. Autrement, avant l'heure de danser, musique un peut trop forte pour avoir une conversation quelconque."}
{"text":"Happy hour is only on watered down cocktails.  Be forewarned, they also take at least 15 minutes to come to the table after ordering.  Cute place otherwise."}
{"text":"We accidentally found this spot while walking through Montreal.  We were instantly attracted by the beautiful, slightly hipster decor and the contrasting hip hop music.  They have a great happy hour special with all drinks half off from 5-7.  Try the East Side cocktail - SO refreshing and delicious. They also do a pretty serious Bloody Caesar. 

The Grilled Mac and Cheese sandwich was not the best, essentially just a mac and cheese filling between two pieces of toast.  Nothing special.

The poutine was great, though not traditional.  And they have a green hot sauce that is one of the best I've EVER eaten.  Make sure to douse all your food in it."}
{"text":"Voilà une des place où il faut aller bruncher...
La terrasse est de sortie quand la rue est barrée (Grand-Prix, Murales, etc...), y a comme un goût de vacances.
L'équipe est jeune et très dynamiques, beaucoup de sourires !!!!
Plus de place en terrasse, ça fait qu'on s'est retrouvé à l'intérieur (baies vitrées ouvertes, c'est pas pire).
La déco est juste superbe, la présentation des plats aussi... J'ai adoré les galettes de pommes de terre qui accompagnent les plats !
Comptez 10 à 15$ par personne avec café.
2ème visite et j'y retournerai, c'est certain !!!"}
{"text":"Dopest spot. One of my favorite places in the city. Good for brunch, dinner or just drinks."}
{"text":"This place gives me life. One of my favorite places to eat, drink, and chill.....ever! My fiancé and I love traveling to Montreal of the street art, shopping and amazing food. Suwu hits the nail on the head with their unique cocktails and comforting menu. Among my very favorite drinks are The Big Booty Hoe and Purple Rain. As far as food goes...the mac n cheese grilled cheese is my favorite dish in the world. It comes with homemade ketchup. It is the love of my life. Their poutine is also unmatched! You have so many options in Montreal...make this one a definite stop!"}
{"text":"Très bon et copieux brunch. Une mention spéciale pour la poutine. Le bemol c'est que leur hôte ne doit pas marcher car ça sent la friture à mon goût."}
{"text":"The \"new\" menu was unimpressive and less then mediocre. Not a very cohesive menu, over hyped and just basic. I wish it was better, maybe I'll come back and try a new menu but doubt it since I'm going back to LA, oh well."}
{"text":"Brunch has officially been re-invented.  Pancakes, French toast and fried eggs have somehow magically transformed to elaborate dishes consisting of some of the most exquisite, and might I say expensive, ingredients.   One such lover of re-inventing brunch is none other than Montreal based Chef Antony Nassif.  I have been following this young Chef on Instagram and Facebook for a while and he consistently surprises me with his insanely creative dishes that he posts so often.  The other day while glancing on Facebook, I noticed he was doing a brunch special at Suwu and I knew I had to have it.

My friend and I arrived on a busy Saturday morning and chose to sit at the bar to watch the action in the kitchen, plus the place was so crowded, we thought the bar would be the best option.  As we sat down, menus were quickly provided and the friendly bartender made us feel welcome instantly.  He let us know the specials of the day which immediately caused me some heartache; how was I supposed to choose between a slow braised breakfast lamb shawarma and a smoked brisket hash with foie gras and truffle?  

We ordered the doughnuts to start while I contemplated what I was going to eat.  My friend knew she wanted the All-dressed MTL bagel and that definitely didn't help my situation.  At the last moment I went for it and decided to order both dishes - Food coma here I come!  

The doughnut arrived quite quickly and was stuffed with a delicious house made berry jam (I thought it was raspberry but not 100% sure), creamy peanut butter and topped with a deliciously sweet glaze and coloured sprinkles.  Cut in half and skewered with a strawberry on top, this doughnut was divine.  The doughnut itself was just perfect.  Soft, chewy and creamy with the perfect glaze and crunch from the sprinkles made me really love this doughnut.   The ratio of peanut butter to jam was just perfect; not too sweet nor was the jam overpowered by the peanut butter - heaven!

After we devoured the dessert, it was time for the real food and a second cup of coffee.  First my shawarma arrived casual style and I dug right in.  The first bite blew my mind.  I guess Chef Antony really knows what he's doing because I have never had a more flavourful shawarma in my life.  The crispy slaw, the crunchy pickled turnips and a fried egg, all pulled together to elevate this shawarma to a whole new level.  From the tender lamb to the rich not overpowering garlic sauce, I now see why this shawarma made its way onto Suwu's dinner menu - minus the fried egg of course.  

Then out of nowhere, the largest breakfast dish I have ever seen appeared in front of me.  Terrified that I was going to pass out from all the food, I slowly put down the shawarma and reached for my fork.  As I took the first bite from the gigantic cast iron pan, I started to feel weak at the knees.  This breakfast hash was in a class of its own.  The truffle, grand des champs cheese and foie gras incorporated with eggs, breakfast potatoes and brisket made this dish truly special.  Each bite incorporated flavours from each element of the dish creating little bites of pure deliciousness.  My only problem with this dish was how big it was, but that worked to my benefit as I took the leftovers home and it re-heated perfectly - Amazing!
We sat at the bar sipping our coffees and digesting the feast we had just devoured.  The bartender kept us entertained and we really had a great time chatting with him.  Sitting at the bar was the best idea ever, not only did we have a clear view of the madness going on in the kitchen, but the bartender let us taste his creations and the service was pretty damn good too.   This brunch is really going to be hard to top, can't wait to see what Chef Antony will come up with next!"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this bar. We were attracted to all of the greenery and plants hanging from the ceilings, went in and didn't regret it. The hostess told us there were no tables for two (?) so we sat at the bar - not a problem. 

While we didn't eat, food sounded good and was decently priced. The cocktails had terrific names, and tasted even better. I had a Wu Tang, El Chapo, and tried the Raspberry Kush. All equally amazing and full of flavour. Good flavour 

My favourite part was the soundtrack- good (like GOOD) hip hop played back to back all night. Service was absolutely terrific, both bartenders were fun, super educated w the drinks and paid attention to folks at the bar. They mentioned to us that the atmosphere changes a lot after dark, and it turns into a club. 

Thank you to everyone at SuWu! We loved it, and we are coming back."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 4 stars more for the cute waiters and FOOD than for the service itself. The decor is also quite cute but a bit noisy depending on when you go--but it's a lounge, so to be expected. I have only been here twice but both times I was very happy with the food (burger, fries, dips, Brussels sprouts, fried chicken, warm salad) and the beer and cocktails are fine. Normal. The first time my waiter forgot to enter an order in so gave my friend and I a round of drinks on the house which was nice. The second time I was with another friend and seated by a young girl who wasn't very friendly and actually seemed quite bored which was a turnoff but then a nice young Asian guy with a moustache (sorry for the silly description, this is exactly what he looked like) took over and was a GREAT and welcome change. Go for the food and to enjoy an afternoon bite and cocktail with friends! Many young girls seem to like coming here in swarms haha. Again, maybe for the cute waiters? Who knows."}
{"text":"Nous sommes venus ce soir pour Montréal Bar et Bouffe.

L'endroit est sympa niveau déco et ambiance. La musique est à mon gout un peu trop forte mais ce n'est pas non plus rédhibitoire.

Concernant les plats goûtés le mien n'avait rien d'extraordinaire et le cocktail était bien.
Celui de ma femme n'était pas vraiment ce qui était annoncé. Il était proposé un ceviche de poisson et ce qui était servis n'en n'étais pas vraiment un. Le plat n'était pas mauvais car l'assaisonnement était bien mais quand on vient dans un endroit pour quelque chose de particulier et qu'on ne le retrouve pas cela déçoit ...

Nous avons regardé la carte et nous avons trouvé que les plats étaient cher. Par exemple le burger à 16$ ne nous faisait pas envie (quantité et visuel) et pour ce prix je pense que l'on peut avoir largement ailleurs.

En conclusion ce n'est pas mauvais mais ce n'est pas un coup de cur non plus."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor but the service was a bit ridiculous. Came here for a girls night out with the idea to stay after eating dinner. Had  a reservation for dinner at 7pm and we're initially seated on a couch which would not be ideal for a meal . It then took 20 minutes to reseat us when there were multiple empty seating areas. I got the chicken lollipops which were about 5 small peices which tasted like mediocre chinese take out. My friend got the fish tacos which were tasty but again small portions. The drinks were very weak and not really worth the price."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place again due to my last harsh review. Was expecting better service but sadly at even 9pm I needed to wait 15mn before they even took my order at the bar. What is up with this place?!"}
{"text":"L'endroit est super charmant, vraiment un beau restaurant pour les yeux! malheureusement, les plats (bien qu'ils soient bons) sont BEAUCOUP trop cher! Payer 20$ pour un morceau de tartare, c'est complètement ridicule! Le menu n'est pas gastronomique; burger, tartares, sandwich, mac&cheese, donc ça ne devrait pas coûter si cher! De plus, les plats sont minuscules, plutôt comme des tapas. 

Je ne suggèrerais pas l'endroit pour manger, mais pour prendre un verre, c'est très bien!"}
{"text":"cool ambiance, good drinks, amazing music makes for a great time what more can you ask for!!"}
{"text":"SuWu is a fun place to hang while in Montreal. You can't beat the $1 oysters on Wednesday nights. The only thing they were missing was horseradish. Service was great. There was music playing. You are surrounded by plants which give the place a great atmosphere. Drinks were good and so was the service. Would definitely go back again!!"}
{"text":"This has been my favourite spot for years and I was a bit surprised when it changed hands but the quality only went up.  We stopped in for brunch. Try to call ahead and get a reso but if you don't, you can just ask them to call you when they are ready for you.  It's totally worth it.  I had the vegetarian dish and we also had the grilled mac and cheese.... the food was delicious but whatever made the afternoon so great was the ambiance and the staff.  The wrap around bar is a great addition and the open concept kitchen made sure that we got to know all the staff.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Place sympathique pour prendre un verre, je n'ai pas eu la chance de déguster la cuisine."}
{"text":"Understaffed. Our waiter was still good but due to the number of people he had to serve, it was slow service. 

Mexican omelette was good but nothing that I as a novice cook couldn't make. I left unimpressed. I love the ambience though. Maybe there is something else worth trying on the menu."}
{"text":"Great ambience and good drinks! There was also a small dance floor and dj playing some hip hop and pop music. Lots of young people - we went out on a Friday night which is definitely recommended! I recommend here over than a night club 1000%"}
{"text":"Maybe my hopes were too high but I was seriously disappointed. It is definitely a pricier place. We were a group of 4. Decided to take 4 appetizers to share plus a main dish and a drink each. We were able to get a bite of each appetizer (which was fine. We wanted to try a small piece of each) but the main meal is where it gets weird. I took the raw tuna. VERY small plate. And nothing comes with it. My boyfriend took the burger and it was drenched in cinnamon. Everything is an extra meaning that if you want fries with your burger, you need to pay extra. So you pay your burger $14 plus the fries which is $8 (if I'm not mistaken).. it starts to add up, fast..
Our waiter was cool. I liked him a lot. Very nice guy."}
{"text":"Its hella awesome! I'm going to find every excuse in the book to return here!"}
{"text":"We had a really great time here and will definitely return.

Got in at about Noon on Saturday for brunch (btw, first time I ever went to brunch that early, SO worth it, much more empty and free and worth your money) and we ended up staying 3 hours.

We were a group of six, and everyone ordered variations of egg dishes and fruit salads. Everything was great. I had eggs benedict with bacon, and they were probably one of the best ones I ever had in my life, really. They were about $12 each plate.

Also, my gf and I had the endless mimosas for $35. It is quite steep, but they are really good, and strong, and the waiter is ON IT, he'll bring one the second it finishes. I ended up having like 8 over the course of 3hrs.

Other people were ordering caesars and stuff, and they were just exceptional.

The place is also really chill, understated, and doesn't have that tacky brunch feel that a lot of places have that make you feel that you're in a shitty version of Sex & the City. The waiter also came over at one point and gave everyone a free shot of their choice and took one with us. The waiter was also super friendly, fast, attentive and just great. Probably best service I ever had in Montreal, honestly.

We had one of the best brunches we'd ever had here. It is quite a pricey experience (for two ppl our bill was $100, others was around $75)  though. However, this is a good place to build your Saturday around as an outing. Not just a quick brunch then something else after. So in that sense, the price becomes not so bad and we'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Semaine de la Poutine oblige, je me suis rendu ici pour essayer la poutine avec la sauce au Sortilege et à l'érable et les boulettes de fromage frit 

Résultat : NOMNOMNOMNOM

Un délice, tout simplement.

Deux pintes pour le prix d'une (je n'ai pas vérifié pour quels horaires cette offre fonctionne) service agréable et souriant mais peut être juste un peu lent. Le bar était plein donc je n'en tiens pas trop rigueur.

Je pense y retourner pour essayer d'autres choses, mais j'espère sincérement qu'ils vont la agrder au menu parce que cette Poutine est tout simplement une tuerie, voilà c'est dit."}
{"text":"SuWu for the first time with my staff for a night out and I must agree I was amazed of that spot and never thought there is such a place like that here wow! Food and drinks were amazing! The ambiance, the music bring me back memories and the DJ is really good! You can still have conversation with your friends while the music is blasting in the background. Going back again thats for sure! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I commonly go here for brunch and it's wonderful. The staff is super friendly, the food is delicious and it's got a great ambiance. We've sat both at the bar as well as at tables and the service is always phenomenal at the bar, table service is sometimes a little slow. 

Excellent booze brunch, they offer a few selections of juice all yummy. The ceaser mix is also great, minus the lime juice for me. 

Portion size's are a little tiny for some plates but decent for others. It's 50/50 but everything is mouth watering good.

A must visit for sure!"}
{"text":"Bar, restaurant et nighclub situé sur la rue St-Laurent en plein cur de la nightlife avec tous les autres bars et clubs. Premier essaie de mon côté après en avoir entendu beaucoup parler on me disait que la nourriture était très bonne, alors j'en avais déjà l'eau à la bouche  Nous sommes arrivées vers 19h30 (un jeudi), on m'avait dit que ce n'était pas nécessaire de réserver pour deux, mais je vous le recommande fortement car il y avait déjà un peu d'attente, mais ce ne fut pas du tout long comme des gens libéraient des tables. Le menu est varié et vraiment abordable. Nous avons pris les bocconcini frits, les crevettes général tao et le tartare de saumon (celui à partager de 18$). Le service fut quand même assez long, mais nous n'étions pas pressés. Nous avions commandé depuis une bonne quinzaine de minutes et n'avions toujours pas reçu le pichet de sangria blanche. Le serveur s'est excusé disant que la demande au bar était très forte ce soir. Les plats sont arrivés et l'alcool a suivi juste après. Les bocconcini frits (4 morceaux à partager) étaient accompagnés d'une sauce crémeuse bien relevée. C'était juste délicieux! Le fromage fondant et salé avec la sauce un peu piquante une combinaison parfaite! Puis, nous avons goûté les crevettes avec la sauce général tao WOW! La sauce délicieuse et sucrée, toutefois la panure ne tenait pas sur les crevettes, mais ce n'est qu'un détail. Le tartare quant à lui était un peu décevant, j'en ai avisé le serveur, cela manquait de sel et de saveur. Le serveur a pris le temps d'en aviser la cuisine. L'établissement nous a offert le dessert comme geste commercial, ce n'était pas du tout nécessaire, mais le geste a été fortement apprécié. Tout au long du repas, nous avons reçu un incroyable service par les deux personnes en salle. Ils s'alternaient et venaient régulièrement vérifier que tout allait bien et que nous avions besoin de rien. Vers 23h le service en salle se terminait et le restaurant se transforma en boîte de nuit, DJ dans la salle, musique forte de type hip hop. Je n'ai pas trop aimé le style de musique et encore moins le type de clientèle, trop jeune, trop excitée, aucune classe. Cela changeait vraiment de l'allure du restaurant que nous avions eu au début. Mais bon je recommande fortement de tester leur nourriture!!!"}
{"text":"We went on a Wednesday night and it was relatively empty. Despite that it was empty we were told not to sit at any larger tables because they were expecting multiple large parties (who never came). We were not given food menus and had to ask for them, which was difficult because our waiter was nowhere to be found. We received the wrong appetizer and had to send it back. We ordered the falafel, Korean BBQ nachos, and salmon tacos, which were all very good, but took a very long time to come out. Ultimately, the food was great, but the service was terrible."}
{"text":"Au premier abord, cette place a tout pour plaire : décor bobo-chic, vins et nourriture  honnêtes et abordables, musique plutôt sympa... bref une jolie découverte si ce n'est :
- le refus catégorique du serveur lorsque je demande de ne pas mettre de piments forts dans mon tartare de saumon. Un serveur qui dit \"non\" à la plus basique des demandes... euh PARDON ?! En quoi est-ce si difficile de ne pas mettre un ingrédient dans un plat qui, de surcroît, ne demande aucune cuisson ? \"Les tartares sont déjà préparés\"... euh PARDON (bis) ?! Donc grosso modo, je paye 18$ pour un tartare que je pourrai trouver dans un hall de gare ?!
- la musique tellement forte qui oblige à crier pour s'entendre un minimum. A 1h du matin, je veux bien, mais à 21h, j'ai un peu de mal avec l'ambiance nightclub, surtout si je suis en train de manger...
Si j'y retourne ? J'aimerai, mais non."}
{"text":"Quelle belle surprise ce nouveau SuWu (ancien Cafétéria) dans cette section du boulevard St-Laurent.  Ça fait du bien de voir quelque chose de différent, contrairement aux autres restos (italiens/grecs) du coin qui ont fermés récemment. Première impression, déco antique sympa avec du bois tout partout comme plusieurs nouveaux resto-bars à Montréal. Personnel souriant, bon service, ambiance relax, prix abordables sur le menu nourriture style pub et boissons, cocktails & bières. Sinon, mes ribs étaient délicieuses et bien apprêtées. Aussi, spéciaux 5@7 les jeudis & vendredis. Y' aussi une TV pour les jours de  matchs. On y retourne !"}
{"text":"The first time I went to SuWu was in 2013. My initial impressions were that it had potential, but needed a lot of work with their service culture - one that values customers. I returned last night to discover that things had gotten worse. The people who work there are clearly biased towards people they know because they ignore everyone else. I have done a lot of traveling and this by far was the worst bar experience I've ever had. Getting a drink is next to impossible and believe me, I understand what bars are like on a busy night. Maybe if the bartenders weren't so concerned with making out with their boyfriends, dancing with their friends, singing along to some of the worst representation of \"hip hop\" I've heard, and getting drunk themselves they wouldn't have a bar full of clearly frustrated customers. However, to their advantage, the clientele is an average age of 18 and seem to have the memories of goldfish so they quickly forget about their bad experience. I'm sure the fact that most are already wasted helps too. It took 15 minutes to be acknowledged by a bartender. I order our drinks and proceed to watch her for another 10 minutes as she got distracted doing various things (everything, but making drinks) and then realize she forgot to serve me. Then the tap kicked so we had to wait another 15 minutes for that to be resolved, all for 3 beers. Because of the poor service, I wasn't planning on tipping, however that decision was taken from me as the bartender didn't return with my change. Granted it was only $3, but it was $3 I didn't want her to have. Overall, the service sucks here and maybe it could thrive if they replaced management and all staff. Lastly, hip hop is more than songs where every other word is a racial slur and lyrics that degrade women. I don't think whoever is in charge of music has any real knowledge of the genre and probably just played songs they heard on pop radio. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Super tasty drinks and nice ambiance! I haven't had the food, but that looks pretty good also- although pretty unhealthy (burger type stuff.) I would not recommend going after 11 on the weekends though because it turns into a club and not a very good one. As a club it's cramped and awkward because there are these giant windows onto the street and there are kind of too few people to dance. If you go when SuWu is a bar though the drinks are very pretty and delicious!"}
{"text":"Think concrete jungle. The decor is quirky and unique. You'll find each wooden table has stools with a shower of plants and fairy lights descending from the ceiling.
You could feel the hip hop vibe it's meant to boast by it's name, rap music and menu. Be sure to check out the menu for some laughs and order a Big Booty Hoe. Unfortunately, it's just a drink and not a comrade but still funny.
We came out here on a night with friends and enjoyed ourselves. These guys understand hang outs. Servers are patient, food is shareable, and they've got drinks."}
{"text":"I was wandering around Montreal on a spiritual quest. I heard a song from Mobb Deep's classic album Hell on Earth playing in the distance. I walked into this bar not knowing what to expect. They played 2 different Wu-Tang related tracks while I sipped a cocktail called Wu-Tang. Other drink names included Big Booty Hoe and Lil Cease. The drinks were slightly expensive. Montreal is also slightly expensive. I am from Cleveland where a dollar equals a dream. I was scared this place was controlled by the street gang called the Bloods because SuWu is how members greet each other."}
{"text":"While SuWu means something completely different where I'm from, I'm assuming here it means something along the lines of amazing brunch meal because that's exactly what we got.

The decor in here is beautiful. With plants hung from the ceilings and accompanied by lights in glass jars, SuWu sets the tone for the adventure that your taste buds are about to take.

The wait staff was excellent and very happy to converse with us on more than just the menu, since it was our first time in the city. 

My brunch meal of choice here was the breakfast pan, a beautiful medley of peppers with poached eggs and a crema that joined in beautifully in the harmony. For my own personal remix, I threw some bacon on it to make sure the pan saaaaaaaaaang to me. Excellent meal that was prepared wonderfully. The rest of my group enjoyed their meals as well, but there were consistent problems regarding the cook of the eggs for some of their dishes which led to the loss of points here.

Regardless of the mishap, SuWu is definitely a key choice in the city of Montreal."}
{"text":"Went in for brunch and the servers were super nice and the food was pretty good as well! The only thing is, that for some of the dishes, the portions are pretty small for the price so you don't really get full. Aside from the food, the vibe is super chill and nice, and the ambience is great! 

PS: this place has pretty good mimosas *.*"}
{"text":"SuWu is hands down one of the best spots in Canada. Make that North America (for everyone under the age of 21). My friend and I went to Suwu on St. Patrick's Day and we enjoyed it so much that we literally couldn't stop coming back. Suwu has AMAZING music. Bangers only. Good college-aged crowd, but there are some old men to buy you free drinks. My friend threw up on the wooden bench across from the bathroom and they didn't even say anything. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Nice clean place, no wait period, staff is cool and food appetizing. I don't understand why this resto does not serve egg white only dishes. The waiter was sweet and asked if they could make an exception, no luck but I appreciate the effort he put in. 
The decor was pretty different from the typical breakfast place, urban jungle with a virtual fireplace, lol. 
I like the exotic real plants, There is nothing more annoying when a restaurant tries to look more nature / exotic-like  with fake plants. 
I would come again."}
{"text":"If you asked me about a year ago, I would have given suwu four stars, with the one star docked because of the pricey drinks. They used to have really unique and awesome seasonal brunch menus, as well as $1 oysters on Wednesday evenings. Unfortunately, all that is gone :( 
I went there for my birthday brunch and while the bottomless mimosas were good, the new, rather generic and mediocre menu was lacking. It was almost as sub-par as Universel or Eggspectations but at least they have extensive menus so you have options. From what I've heard, the menus have been equally disappointing since.
If you do end up going, I recommend asking for the smokeshow hot sauce to put on your home fries. It's a local brand that's super fresh and flavorful, and much less artificial-tasting than Sriracha (you can also buy it at Mandy's). 
If you go at night, the fries were super tasty back when there were $1 oysters - I don't know if they're still as good but I'd recommend them just to try. There was a  \"seasonal dip\" once that was supposed to be hummus but just tasted like straight-up tahini - would not recommend.
To the management - I don't know if you changed chefs or what but please bring back the old fun, interesting brunch menu that made sitting in your pseudo-hipster bar worth it :("}
{"text":"It is always nice to see a new spot pop up in my neck of the woods. The Milton-Parc district a.k.a McGill Ghetto and its adjacent strip of Saint-Laurent street presents some interesting options to check out and I certainly have my regular locales (I have mentioned how much I LOVE Icehouse?) Last week, SuWu neighborhood bar opened up replacing the now departed Cafeteria right by the corner of St-Laurent and Prince Arthur. I saw some pictures of the media event they hosted and decided that I definitely needed to try the interesting food and drinks that they were serving.

I sadly didn't have the chance to take any nice interior shots of the bar but the first thing that sticks out about the space is the great decor and feel they have created. Outdoor-but-indoors look with copious amounts of wood panels, wood table and bar countertops, fake plants, a ceiling lattice with vines and lights hanging off from above. Add some great music and a few nice vintage touches and you have a setting relaxed enough to simply have a nice drink and watch the game but upscale enough to make it an evening out before heading elsewhere along the Main. 

The bar has a variety of beers on tap, some speciality cocktails and a pretty interesting \"Mickey\" service with different varieties of tequila, gin and bourbon. To start, I ordered an bourbon Olde Fashioned. For me personally, this is my test of a bar's (and a bartender's) worth. An olde fashioned is a very classic and straightforward drink but one that can be royally messed up if you don't take care to prepare properly. This one was okay. I've had better around the city but this is one I would order again to give it a second try.

The food menu is an interesting mix of warm and cold dishes that certainly are not what we would call \"traditional\" bar food. To start, a order of rosemary fries. Exactly what you would expect. Very crispy fries with a strong but not overbearing hint of rosemary. A good starter.

Next up, my big winner for the evening : mini biscuit and fried chicken sandwiches with kimchi. A very unique but well created dish. The biscuit buns were solid, the fried chicken was nicely seasoned and crispy and the kimchi added a nice little kick with the festivities. Absolutely a must order again.

To change it out, we ordered the spicy Edamame. I love edamame and in the end, while it was quite good, let's just say that edamame covered with a spice mix is not necessarily the right thing to eat while sitting at a bar. A little too messy for my taste at a bar like this.

Still hungry, we ordered the Meat Ball Tacos. While very creative, this was a miss for me mostly on account of the hard shell tacos being used. I was originally under the impression that it would be soft tortillas and I think it would have made it better and more importantly, easier to eat. When the shells crack after a bit and fall apart, it makes eating meat balls and smoked mozzarella covered in tomato sauce a little bit harder. I get the texture addition of the hard shells but it didn't do it for me.

Finally, this bar even has dessert! we ordered the rice crispy Panini with chocolate, peanuts and homemade creme fraiche. Rich and sweet, this was a very nice way to finish a night of food with a few drinks.

I did have some small issues with the service that evening - specifically the process of ordering food from the bar because the bartender who took our food order was also supposed to go pick up our order. At the same time, she got swamped with all the drink orders for all the tables so our food sat for pick up much longer than it should have. The staff seemed to fixed that issue by getting someone else to bring the food to the bar by the end of the night. It didn't have a negative impact on the food thankfully and I will be curious to see on my soon-to-be subsequent visits - and believe me, there will be. I live 10 minutes away on foot for god's sake! - if that was simply a opening week one-off.

I was quite satisfied with my first taste of SuWu and happy to see a new neighborhood bar opened up close by. I will definitely be heading back to try the rest of the menu that still has me intrigued. Hopefully, they make a good enough impression with the rest of the locals to stick around for a while.

{"text":"I've visited SuWu a couple times- mostly due to all of the hype I feel like it's gotten in the last year. Needless to say, I really feel like the SuWu experience is just that- hype.

The drinks are consistently weak and overpriced, the place is always understaffed, and the food is basic basic basic. Last time I visited I had the breakfast chili- likely the most bland and expensive vegetarian chili with (1) poached egg I have ever had.

During our last visit, while waiting to get seated, a group of twelve women came in for a birthday party and mentioned to the host that they had made a reservation two weeks earlier for their group. The host bashfully informed them that they no longer take reservations as of a few days, and as such their reservation had been cancelled and no one had thought to call them.

WOAH THERE. BAD MANAGEMENT MOVE.

I gave two stars based on the fact that the decor is great, as is the location."}

{"text":"really good cocktails (Cheap during 5 a 7), excellent service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the food is really superb. We just ordered a lot of plates and shared them between the four of us, so I can tell you the chicken bucket, pogos, rosemary fries, and grilled cheese mac 'n cheese are all really flavorful. 

The only two things I didn't like: the cocktails and house beer were super weak and watered down; the drinks are all very pricey with a draft beer going for $9 which is a bit absurd. If you go here, go for the food."}
