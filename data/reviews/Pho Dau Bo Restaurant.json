{"text":"This place is a lot better than any pho place downtown. The pho is delicious, flavourful, and affordable. We always get salad rolls and avocado shakes as well. The only problem is it's a bit far to get there :("}
{"text":"I  go to this place at least one a month with my family.

The food is always good and service is fast and friendly.  It has one of the best beef pho noodle soups in town.  the prices have gone up in the last little while but still a good value"}

{"text":"Here is the worst pho restaurant in my life.. Taste is so so and service is really terrible..They double charged money so I complained about it.. But one female server denied to check it so I had to go with my credit card bill.. I WILL NEVER GO THERE!! If you come here, you should really care about double charging!!!!! Terrible terrible"}
{"text":"Disgusting with a capital D. 

The pho was very salty and the next morning I felt like I drank a bucket of sea water which leads me to believe a lot of MSG was added to the food.

The real kicker though was the staff person slapping his dirty mop around the restaurant oblivious to the fact people were eating. Another staff person was busy cleaning the walls...again while people were eating.

Even one star is too much but there's no option for a big fat zero. Stay far far away from this place!"}
{"text":"The prices are fair and I'm surprised that only recently they have issued new menus and changed the prices. This particular location is frequented by a lot of Vietnamese in the community, as well as being owned and managed by a Vietnamese family. I believe there's a certain amount of pride involved in serving your own ethnic food that usually results in a better experience. It's all anecdotal, but I've noticed the difference between Japanese owned sushi restaurants and Chinese owned ones. This applies to almost all restaurants, from fast food to fancier fare. The service here is quick and efficient. I could order, eat and leave in about 15 minutes if I wanted to. 

I usually get a Pho Dac Biet, which has a little bit of everything thrown in a very tasty broth. A large is a satisfying serving of meats, tendon and noodles. An extra large is what I usually order, but that may be too much for most people. I find the broth is usually better on the weekend, rather than what you get on a slower weekday. But maybe that's just me. I enjoy the durian shakes, as well as the various vermicelli dishes. 

The little things separate this location from other Pho restaurants. For example, the plate of bean sprouts, lime and other herbs that accompany your meal are fresh and generous. I've been to places where you are given a sliver of lime to add to your dish and I can't believe that such actions can be justified in terms of savings.

As the years go by, I find myself travelling from further and further away just to eat here. The consistency of the food and a bit of sentimentality keeps me coming back. I know exactly what I'm going to get and there's a certain level of comfort that comes from that."}
{"text":"This is the beat pho resturant in the gta. This restaurant started out with one location and now has expanded to over 12 different locations. The price is reasonable for the quality and quantity of food you get.  Pho is excellent for hang overs and a great meal when your sick. Beware, sodium is extremely high."}
{"text":"I rarely give any restaurants a perfect score. But this ladies and gentlemen is something else, pho like never before. 

Ordered the chicken pho with the pork spring rolls.

The pho is a never ending bowl, they give you enough pho to feed Albion mall. I didn't even have the biggest size. The flavour of the pho is so tasteful and vibrant because of all the mint leaves and the broth. This pho broth has got to be the best in all of Toronto. I have yet to try a pho as good as this. The crispy pork rolls are delicious with the pho. They compliment the pho and are also light and have a good amount of meat.

The price is on point the food is on point, just make sure when you come here wear a bullet proof vest cause it's near Jane and finch and sometimes there's shady people walking around."}
{"text":"Pros:
-Best Pho in GTA
-Great prices, huge portions (I dare you skinny people to finish an XL pho without feeling sick aftewards)
-One of the very few places that serve Banh Cuon
-Little to no MSG in the pho soup yet still one of the best

Cons:
-Franchised locations do not live up to the quality of this location which I think is the original.
-I live more than 5minutes away from this place.... but this could be a Pro because if I lived closer I'll die from stuffing myself everyday.

I've been to over 20 pho places in the GTA and this is still my favourite.  I'm a regular visitor since I first discovered it about 3 years ago and I'm willing to drive all the way from Scarborough for a proper pho fix from this place.

The Scarborough location of pho dau bo is a joke, the soup doesn't taste half as good and is full of MSG. I think this is the original location of the franchise because it's run by Vietnamese ppl, always busy and the soup has little to NO MSG.

Also, it's one of the very few places that serve Banh Cuon which are Vietnamese steamed rice rolls with ground pork inside, dipped in fish sauce.

Oh ya, if you order take away they'll pack the soup in a separate container so the noodles don't get soggy. They also wrap the rare beef in saran wrap so it doesn't bleed over your other meat/noodles, very nice touch!"}
{"text":"My absolute favourite place to go for pho. My family and I have been coming here for as long as I can remember and the pho has always been amazing. 

Prices are fair and service is alright."}
{"text":"Good stuff: service was quick and staff were average nice. Ordered size small but portions were generous. Reasonably priced. I appreciate that there was sriracha on every table.

Cons: there is only 1  non beef pho option. I got it / it's chicken. The broth was very nice but the chicken had slimy pieces of skin on it which don't look appetizing and don't have a texture I like. The chicken itself was not freshly cooked. The spring rolls with shrimp and pork were ok. Vermicelli dish was also ok. The resto was cold because the door kept letting in really cold air as it was frequently opened. 

I tried this place because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews. 2.5/5"}
{"text":"For Pho, I'd prefer Golden Turtle - a bit further drive for me, but definitely worth it for the broth.

Pho Dau Bo is closer, and the prices are comparable but the portions are somewhat smaller.  Still the service is relatively quick, and their rice portions are quite adequate indeed.

For the steamed rice with meats (pork chops, chicken, etc), I would choose this place.  

They could afford to change the channel once in a while though."}
{"text":"Bun bo hue and banh coun are my favourite combo at Vietnamese restaurant. The BBH portion is big with pig blood, beef shank, pork belly and the Vietnamese sausages. It's a bit spicy, savoury and lots of lemon grass and extra basil leaves. One bowl of love in it! Service is also friendly too!"}
{"text":"The first Pho Dau Bo Restaurant ever in the GTA - it is still flipping amazing! Special beef noodle soup is always my go to - you can even drink the beef broth. You get more than what you pay for. Definitely authentic and definitely affordable!"}
{"text":"Great pho and the pad Thai is a huge and tasty platter for $8.50. Service is generally quick, especially if you only have the pho. My son loves the pork chops and rice there. 

Good food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"While the food was good compared to Ottawa and Montreal, it was not that special compared to most Toronto places.

I order pho tai nam (Rare beef and flank)

The broth was nothing special and did not stand out to me.
The noodles were good in that they did not taste powdery (I.e. Not overboiled) and the beef was not dry.

The serving was generous though, for both the beef and noodles.

Other than that, nothing makes this restaurant stand out more than others in Toronto."}
{"text":"The food are awesome and delicious.  Regarding the price and services are great.  Try and you will know what you are missing.  I always go here ones a weeks  for the last 3 years"}
{"text":"This place is a legend. Rare beef Pho is delicious and comes out so quickly! Rice noodle rolls are the best! We come here at least 2x a month - best!"}
{"text":"Made me sick even before I left.
Egg roll was grey inside.
Steamed egg was microwaved chew"}
{"text":"My nephew and I were starving after a visit from Canada's Wonderland and he suggested this place for Pho.  This place is located in a strip mall.  The dining area was clean and spacious and it was pretty busy for it not even being lunch time.  

I had the rare beef and brisket pho and my nephew had the rare beef and meatballs pho.  I am from Seattle and there are a lot of Pho restaurants so I know what good Pho tastes like.  This place does it well. The broth was very flavorful and not salty.  I wasn't thirsty afterwards so there was either very little or no msg used.  We also ordered the cha gio which were also good, seasoned just right with a good amount of filling.  
 
Portion is huge, price is on point and the service was fast and friendly.   My nephew is a regular here so the next time I am in town I will ask him to bring me here again."}
{"text":"Favorite place for pho and typically visit when I'm on this side of town. Try Markham/Richmond Hill pho and you will understand lol."}
{"text":"Mediocre pho and service. There must be better option."}
{"text":"Love the food at this place. Always an ideal spot for lunch. Their chicken friend rice is amazing and the portions is very filling. The spices that are provided are excellent as well. Service is minimal, but what else would you expect ?"}
{"text":"One of my favourite lunch spots.  My colleagues and I visit here regularly.

Service is quick and food is always piping hot.

I usually order the vermicelli with grilled chicken which is very filling.  The chicken is moist and exterior crisp.  Vermicelli is perfectly done.

The pho is great.  Small bowl usually does the trick for lunch.  If I am super hungry, I order the medium bowl.  The broth is not overtly saltly.

Spring rolls and the rice sticky buns with shrimps are great appetizers.

Flan is quite good too - eggy custard like with the caramel sauce.  Their coffee shake was yummy, beware of strong coffee taste.

Pricing - you can get lunch under $10, you can not beat that."}
{"text":"This location is not just the best Pho Dau Bo location, it's the best pho restaurant in Toronto. I guess with all the pho restaurants that popped up everywhere years ago, I got used to eating at whichever place was the best in my neighbourhood, and tricked myself into thinking that that was good pho. But now I have realized that THIS is what good pho actually is. It's pretty much the same price as all other pho restaurants, give or take a dollar maybe, but they put way more meat in the pho and it just tastes so much better. My favourite bowl of noodles, which I have been searching for a good rendition of for a long time, is the hu tieu my tho. It's the clear noodles with seafood, a battered deep fried shrimp, and a quail egg. It's a must try!! The friends I dined with ordered pho, vermicelli, and shredded pork rolls for appetizers, and were equally happy with their dishes. Portion sizes are big to begin with but this is one of the places where you can order an XL pho and it actually lives up to its name!"}
{"text":"Come here often as its around the corner from me. Fresh, hot and always serving right when you get in. The free tea is delicious too!"}
{"text":"I'm Vietnamese and this is my go to place for pho (when my mama's cooking isn't available).

Hands down the best pho soup anywhere!
The food is consistent and really fast. I eat here like every week for 10 years lol."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the area. The pho and vermicelli dishes are consistently good. The pho has a lot more flavour than at some places I've been to. The service is lightning fast and polite. Lots of whities eating there ;-) and it can be very busy, but good!"}
{"text":"this pho place is very good. The first time I came here I came here with a friend and ordered number 452. This was the vermicel and was the best pho I had. Worth a try"}
{"text":"Fast service! Always hot soup with lots of goodies. Great service with always a smile. One of the best pho place in Mississauga"}
{"text":"has gotten more expensive i think and the bowls seem smaller...
just tried this place, $5 for a small bowl. It's still one of the good pho restaurants out there though. Broth is excellent."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pho in Toronto. I've been coming here since I was a little kid and they've been super consistent. The service is really quick and the quality is amazing. Sure it doesn't look like the fanciest restaurant, but it doesn't need to.  The more homey, the better the food is. They do other Vietnamese dishes well too and I'm usually someone who likes to switch up my order, but every time I come here I just have to order pho dac biet. It doesn't get any better.  :)"}
{"text":"Authentic Vietnamese pho is hard to find these days. There are only a few places I truly truly enjoy in north york and this one of them. 

PRO TIP:
My best tip for how to spot the good pho places? Walk in, you must hear Vietnamese music, the furniture should be simple and perhaps dated, and the staff should be speaking a lot of loud Vietnamese to each other. Guaranteed good pho!!! If the place is modern/chic and trendy then chances are the pho won't be good. My personal experience.

I typically order the pho tai bo vien, the soup is perfect authentic, or rice with grilled chicken and shredded pork skin and a fried egg. Vermicelli is great too. Cannot go wrong! Spring rolls are a must, done right the Vietnamese way. Mango milkshake or viet coffee to close.

I never stray in the menu so I have never tried out anything else in all the 15 years I've eaten here. Cannot comment on other items."}
{"text":"Yeah. Yes. Yup. Mhm. Right on. Affirmative.

This was some delicious pho! I ordered the plain pho and added tofu and the vegetarian spring rolls. DID NOT DISAPPOINT.

All of the positive words up top were meant to bolster the positive reviews of this gem in Jane and Finch. So freaking tasty that I'm super full and yet somehow want to put more in my goshdern mouth. How? Why? I wish I knew the answers to those questions!

Polite and fast service, good-sized menu, vegetarian options, and really delicious meal. I got what I came for. I think you will too."}
{"text":"It's like a hot bowl of soup on a cold winter's day... Wait. That's exactly what it is. One of my favorite pho restaurants in the GTA, Pho Dau Bo is fast food without any of the drawbacks of typical fast food. 

If you're expecting fine dining, this noodle house isn't the best establishment to walk into, but adequate service, good, wholesome Vietnamese cuisine and affordable prices make it a must for any pho soup fan. 

The atmosphere is outstanding, and not in a fine dining restaurant or cheesey family restaurant way. There's a certain sense of community one can only find in Vietnamese noodle houses, and Pho Dau Bo has it in spades, no matter which location you choose. It feels like you were invited over for the holidays by your Vietnamese college roommate and his family is pulling all the stops to feed you. It's laid back enough that it doesn't feel like a crime to put your elbows on the table and slurp up your noodles.

The food is typically good fare... for the price. Don't expect the latest Viet/Thai/Morrocan/Burmese/Mars fusion cuisine created by the next Jamie Oliver wannabe. This is wholesome Vietnamese home cooking at its finest, and for a twenty you'll get a plate of rice, barbecued pork chop, a bowl of the famous Vietnamese beef noodle soup the size of your head and a three colored shake for dessert. All of it satisfying, tasty and healthy.

One of the greatest institutions that Canadian culture has ever adopted is exemplified in this chain of restaurants. Those new to the Vietnamese dining experience, keep in mind; ordering food is a completely self serve process. You're seated at any available seat, given a menu and a slip of paper. You simply jot down the number of the item that you want on the slip and when the wait staff returns, return the menu and paper with your order and they'll return with all of your food. It sounds strange at first, but you soon start to prefer this method over typical Western fast food ordering where we stand in line like cattle.

Bottom Line: Always the answer to the question , \"Where do you guys want to eat?\""}
{"text":"This is a great pho restaurant if your hunting for pho on the west end. We ordered one fried spring roll, one shrimp and shredded pork rice roll and 2 pho with rare beef and tendon with one switched to the bun bo hue soup. The owner took our order personally and did not object to the substitution and was smiling as he took our order. Both the apps and the pho came out in 5 minutes so extremely fast. Both spring rolls were pretty standard in taste compared to other pho restaurants. The regular pho broth was good but not as flavorful as some other pho places. Both broths were not piping hot and were verging on warm to hot which could have vastly improved the tasting experience. Maybe the noodles were cold and they just threw them in the soup which would have cooled the temperature of the overall broth. Overall it's a safe bet for Viet food but a couple of tweeks like more herbs or stronger flavored pho  broth and making sure the broths come out nice and hot could make this place a gem."}
{"text":"When it comes to pho in Toronto this is the holy grail. Great price with authentic tasting pho. The soup base is amazing. I have been to a lot of pho restaurants around the world and in Asia and only some restaurants have come close to their standards but nothing has topped this."}
{"text":"This is my regular Pho Dau bo.. the place is clean, food is tasty... price is right.. nuff said"}
{"text":"This place is located west of North York, in a large Vietnamese plaza. The decor inside is dated with you having to write your own order based on the menu. All of the utensils and sauces are in the table. The tables are placed close to each other and space is tight. Their Pho is very good and thus the reason why we drive all the way there. We usually order the Rare Beef and Tendon Pho while today, we also ordered the Bun Bo Hue. Service is decent and food comes out fairly quick but language might be an issue if requesting a special order. This place will be rated 3.5 Stars if I could."}
{"text":"Excellent pho, best I've had in a while. Customer service is wonderful. If you like pho you must stop by, I'm sure we will be."}
{"text":"I didn't have the best experience at this restaurant. I walked in and wasn't greeted and then the cashier lady finally said hi to me and gave me the \"your by yourself look\". She the pointed me to a seat that was in the corner where she walked away right after seating me. I looked at the menu and after looking through it all I had decided on what I wanted to eat. BUT wait I waited for a while before any server decided to come take my order. Seriously all their other guest had already started to eat. I kept looking around and from across the room I could see into the kitchen and I saw the kitchen worker and was giving him the \"can I get help,hello\" face. He finally hit his bell and the server turned around and he pointed to me and said something to the lady. After that I was just wondering if the food would suck or not, but overall it wasn't bad. I would just say the service was bad today - and they weren't short staff at all ...."}
{"text":"So, I pack up the Griswold family wagon and headed off for a 2 minute drive to Pho Dau Bo on Bristol Road in Mississauga. Their food is so delicious! So my Wife and the little one, Sara Bear (17) love to go for Pho. Until recently, my life has been Pho'less, but the Wife and Little Bear has introduced me to wonderful Asian cuisine. 

The three of us ate for $30 (including a $4 tip). The food was brought to us in less than 10 minutes. We all ordered Grilled Chicken Pho. Two small orders and one large. As the wife spoke to our waitress in cantonese... I listened intently as I tried to learn the local dialect. I blurted out that I wanted bing shui (ice water) in Cantonese. The tasty morsels of grilled chicken, Lionel Richie songs playing in the background.. too bad there wasn't a dance floor. 

The side of bean sprouts and mint leaves add a great flavour to the dish. I also ordered the small order of veggie spring rolls. The grilled chicken in the soup is so tasty, with the noodles, and I put in some sriracha sauce just to spice it up a little. We have gone three times in the last month. Good service too... just don't order a bubble tea.. according to Little Bear it wasn't so good, much better at those specialty bubble tea stores. 

I give the restaurant top marks, for a relaxing dinner, not costing an arm and a leg!"}
{"text":"I like Pho Dau Bo. Not the best Pho Ive had but good enough for when Mom isn't making any at home. Outdated and small but It doesn't bother me since Im there only to eat and get out. Fast service and wallet friendly."}
{"text":"Situated in a plaza with a few other Vietnamese shops, this restaurant is a star!  Our family used to frequent the neighbouring Peach Garden restaurant but after a couple of samplings here and definitely since our last visit this past weekend, Pho Dau Bo has solidified its place as our go-to when we crave Vietnamese food.  

Conspicuously busier than Peach Garden and for good reason!  Menu variety is awesome!  Offers perhaps slightly more variety...or maybe I just like their selection more.  Choose from the classic Pho, rice, vermicelli, soup, appetizers and beverages including the yummy fruit shakes.  Pricing is very affordable.  Portions are quite generous as well.  Service is fast and friendly and this is quite impressive because they are almost always packed to capacity.  Definitely our go-to for tried and trusted Vietnamese food in our area!"}
{"text":"Best Pho Dau Bo in the Toronto! I have eaten at the Brampton, Sauga, and St. Catherines locations and this location in North York is by far the most consistent and authentic!  They give you full bean sprouts, mint leaves, limes, and red chilli peppers (not those imitation green peppers some places try to give you) with every bowl of Pho!

The Pho is delicious and consistent every single time I come here.  The broth is made to perfection and you spend about 2 minutes waiting after you order.  They have small to extra large bowls of Pho.  Props goes out to all those people who can finish an extra large bowl of Pho and still function after...that much Pho in one sitting would make me go to sleep instantly!

Pho is the best comfort and hangover food.  Needless to say they are pretty busy on Saturday and Sunday afternoons but they turn around the tables quickly so feel free to wait.

The Fresh Rolls are yummy too and a great appetizer to help get you started on your cure to your hangover.

Service is quick and on point.  Another great plus is there is plenty of parking around too!"}
{"text":"Returning Customer Time after Time!! I LOVE THIS PLACE!! 

If you want tasty food at a affordable price and good service, this Pho place is the place to go!

Food: 5/5 the food here is affordable, $8.25 for almost all entrees on the menu and comes pretty big. The food is very tasty, amazingly marinated every time, and the best part being that they don't over use MSG!! 

I highly recommend their appetizers, noodle soup and Bun!

I've also heard their milk shakes are great.

Service 4/5: While the service isn't perfect, you are looking at practically a fast pho place, however they are attentive to your requests. I've come here multiple times and never had an issue.

This has been my go to pho place ever since it has opened and I'm glad it has kept up with it's consistency. I think I'll always be a returning customer."}
{"text":"My favorite Pho place in the area, definitely like it better than the place a couple doors down.  
Good and cheap food, not the place to be if you're looking for service or ambiance, but it's your typical Vietnamese place. Super fast service, great for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Best Pho restaurant in the GTA! A little out of my area but my bf and are I willing to drive here because its just that good! We've been to the other chain restaurants but this location serves to be the best and the longest standing most successful one. 

Service: quick and they always take my \"special\" order without any issue

Ambience: the restaurant is always busy with many tables but the turnaround time is quick, you usually dont have to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated

Food: we always order the shrimp fresh rolls and PHO, everytime it's fresh but the soup broth is the reason why we come here...its light, not oily (like some of the other locations) and TASTY! The herbs are always fresh with a decent amount.

This restaurant is owned and runned by a family so they put a lot of pride and heart in what they serve! Go here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"*Edited to 2 stars from 3 stars, and I originally gave it a 4, because their unsanitary work ethics.
The server was bringing out  phos with her finger in soup.   ugghh
This place seriously needs to get cleaned up. 

I am not a big fan of Pho but I go here with family because they love this place.
When I go, I usually get grilled chicken and rice. It is so delicious and inexpensive.
Their fresh shrimp spring rolls are very good, but I am kind of sick of it now. :)
Sometimes it is little smelly though. 

The restaurant atmosphere reflects price of its menu. It if very affordable so, I don't expect luxurious interior. But I wish they clean their cleaning rags more often. They stink once in a while when they wipe the table."}
{"text":"Pho is good and spring rolls nice authentic stuff.
Prices decent.

Place is no fuss decor. Sometimes they mop while you eat so all you smell is bleach with your pho.

Staff ignores customers and more interested in chatting with friends at times."}
{"text":"Okay honestly I came to the area with my husband initially to try Bun Bo Hue at Weston and Finch but it was overly packed. Therefore we came to Pho Dau Bo. Wasn't that happy at the beginning as I have been to their other locations and really wanted to try a different pho joint but it turned out not bad. 

I think the decor is typical of pho joints - quite dated too. The menu says something like \"since 1994\" on the cover so that explains it. Tables and chairs are so close to each other so it's not that of a comfy place to dine in; however the food could make up for it. Our pho came out quick and tasted great; there was a lot of locals as we were eating and they all seemed to enjoy their dishes.

Service was efficient and polite for the most part; one server lady was particularly pleasant but I failed to note down her name. 

All in all I think it's still worth recommending. It sucks that the Asian grocery store next door closed down so I can't do dining and grocery shopping in one trip. :(

Cash only."}
{"text":"food was great. i loved the broth. service was great as the server understood english to put my order in smoothly."}
{"text":"My new favourite spot for a hearty bowl of pho!

My usual pho fix was always Pho Mi 99 in the Hearland area. A friend of mine recently introduced me to this pho place. I must admit I have drived by this plaza millions of times but I have never felt like trying it out. What a hidden gem it is!

What differed from Pho Mi 99 was the broth and noodles. The broth was clearer, lighter in taste and I definitely felt less MSG, which is a good sign that the soup was relatively fresh. The noodles were cooked al-dente - soft but not soggy. They didn't have the typical \"rice flour\" taste at all.  It had enough meat as well.

It has various types of hot peppers and hot sauces on the side so you can adjust the amount of heat you want in your bowl.

I only had a small pho on that day. It was indeed quite small in size, but heck, it's just less than $6. Medium size is a dollar more. Large is two dollars more.

Again, typical Vietnamese pho place's serivce - quick and very little interaction between you and the servers.  You can go up to the counter and pay after you are done."}
{"text":"I don't get a chance to frequent this place as much as I would like to since the pho is pretty good and the fact that I live in the east end of the city. Quite a few people in the Vietnamese community feel they have the best pho in Toronto behind Pho Tien Thanh on Ossington Ave. Yes Pho Dau Bo is a chain but this particular location is run and owned by a Vietnamese family and not Chinese owners which usually makes a significant difference in the authenticity and quality of food.

I normally get a large Pho Dac Biet (special) for $6.50 and an avocado shake for $3.00.

The broth is excellent, the noodles are not bad, pretty consistent, never undercooked or overcooked. The quality of meat is good, thinly sliced and slightly rare and not covered in fat. The tendon quality is also nice. You also get a fair quantity of meat and noodles. The accompanying vegetable plate always has fresh bean sprouts, mints, lime and sawtooth herb.

Service: The service is decent, nothing bad or exceptional which is pretty common for most Vietnamese restaurants and the food comes out pretty quickly depending on what your ordering.

Decor: Minimal decor, washrooms are clean and ample seating.

Pricing: It's pretty cheap compared to many other Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto especially for the quality and quantity you are receiving. I don't think they have raised their prices in years which is great for customers."}
{"text":"I found this Pho Dau Bo to be much better than the one on Dundas street for the following reasons:

- Cleaner
- didn't get weird stares from the cashiers
- they spoke English

As for the food, I had a spring roll and the Bun Bo Hue. The spring rolls were so long and huge, I think each one was 1 foot long and they were good (plate comes with two).  As for the Bun Bo Hue, it had a good assortment of meat including the items that are considered delicacies (I'll spare the reader from what this actually is), and a healthy portion of other meat.  It was tasty, but not too much different from other Pho places.  Prices are reasonable.

Verdict: Come here for a quick, no-fuss meal if you have a Pho craving.  Not worth a special drive more than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"This place used to be good, now it's horrible.  Given, it is a pho place, so I did not expect much in terms of customer service.  Even with this low expectation, I was horrendously surprised that I found the service to be way sub-par. The one and only waitress had enough time to chit chat with a couple for five minutes plus instead of attending to take orders.  I noticed two people going up to the cashier twice (she was chit chatting and wasn't there), walked up again to ask for their strawberry shake and walked up again with a twenty dollar bill to leave, without getting the strawberry shake.  She then made the strawberry shake when they were about to leave and pay.  The waitress also walked by me a couple of times when my order was in my hand and ready for pick up, that I thought I might as well walk this to the window to the kitchen myself.  Now the food, the food is horrible.  They do quantity over quality and when I say quantity, I mean they give you too much cheap soggy noodles, with very little soup and meat.  I wanted pho, meaning I wanted soup.  When I told the waitress the soup was gone after 5 spoonfuls and I think this is too little soup, she said, \"It came out fast didn't it?\".  I agreed, but what does the food coming out fast have to do with the soup? She then said you're talking on the phone... I was texting, but anyway what does phone use have to do with the amount of soup in the pho?  She then charged me $1.00 for a 1/3 cup of soup and $2.00 for a full cup.  I said, if you're charging me $1.00 for a half cup, then I logically expect half a cup!  Why are they so cheap?  I remember going to a pho place before and they would give you extra soup for free.  If I wanted plain noodles, then I'd buy a pack and drop them in water and eat it, but I wanted pho.  Now the meat was just disgusting.  It was so dry and so scarce.  I think it's a couple of days old.  I ordered the beef brisket, which is usually juicy and fatty.  Instead I received some dried up overcooked version of beef Brisket. Sad to say, but this place has turned to the worst and I used to love the chain Pho Dau Bo.  I guess the owners here have turned super cheap, what a shame for the Pho Dau Bo chain that the Bristol location is ruining their reputation."}
{"text":"Ordered here for take out and they got the order wrong on two separate occasions.  
First time we just ate it and called them and told them they messed up.
The second time when we went to pick it up we made sure to ask and the lady at the counter said yes it was what we ordered. When we got him the order was WRONG! Again. 
Called and the lady said she messed up, the same one we asked if our order was right. Then she said she would replace the item she messed up.
We asked for new meals since they were cold and we had to waist another 15 min to drive back and get the correct order and we would return the original meal that lady at the counter got wrong.

When I got to the restaurant this lady didn't even say sorry, just gave me the replacement meals and wanted to check the food we brought back to see if we touched it, which we didn't eat any of it. Then she mothered something about next time under her breath and walked off and brought that food back to the kitchen. Could care less that it was her mistake and we had to waist an hour driving back and forth 4 times to get the order she messed up.

Don't waste your time or money here, they could care less if they screw up your order or that you have to waste your time driving to fix their mistakes."}
{"text":"Just average. Nothing special. 
Deep fried spring rolls are fishy and the pho was salty."}
{"text":"Eat a lot of pho with my buddies and this place was the recommended spot if wiling to make the drive (close to my fiancée's house) 

I love the thicker noodles as compared to other places and even though my well done beef is NEVER well done I still love this place because that seems to be the norm 

I usually get well done beef with beef balls and always enjoy the meal despite the mountain of fat that ends up beside my bowl

A place to try if you have not already"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the cleaner Vietnamese Restaurants. Ordered #319 (rare beef) and it arrived within minutes of ordering. Restaurant workers were presentable and actually spoke English lol."}
{"text":"I've been coming here pretty regularly for years - at least a few times a month - and it's always consistent. The pho really hits the spot during the colder months or when you're nursing that pounding hangover. I'd even go as far as to say it's the best restaurant-made pho you can get in the city (nothing compares to home made pho!). The service is always very fast and accommodating as I usually ask for extra limes or a small dish of nuoc cham even when it doesn't come with the dish. The prices are reasonable with $5 for a small pho as an example. For the specialty noodle soups such as \"bun bo hue\" you get a pretty sizable portion."}
{"text":"We were actually planning on going to another Pho place, but there was a bit of a wait, so we decided to check out this restaurant.  It was busy as well but a table was available.  This was on 24 March 2018 around 13:45.  Nice atmosphere, very quick service and polite staff.  My husband ordered the Well-done Beef Rice Noodle Soup and I had the Well-done Beef & Beef Balls Rice Noodle Soup.  We both enjoyed our meals.  We will plan on going back."}
{"text":"This place is a very close 2nd to my very favourite pho 'Hung long'.  Yes, 'Hung Long' is the name of a restaurant.  Anyway, Pho Dau Bo is an awesome place. Cheap, very very fast eventhough it's pack during lunch hours.  Pho is very good, vermicelli's excellent, rice dishes are very good as well.  I love this place and will always hit it up whenever i'm in the area.  A group of us at work drive 15-20 min. one way to during lunch to go here and we can still make it back to work in an hr total.  much praise, long live Pho Dau Bo (this particular location only...)"}
{"text":"Ever since we were kids, if my folks were too lazy/pressed to make it on their own, or if we had Vietnamese guests, Pho Dau Bo is the one and only place they'd eat at.
(this location is the finest within the GTA.)
All the classics are done well.

The most authentic Pho in Toronto."}
{"text":"Average to A-OK on the pho scale. Out of the number of Vietnamese restaurants in the plaza, this one usually attracts the most customers. 

Quick to order; quick to serve. 

Ordered:

Vermicelli with grilled pork and pork sausage - A personal fave dish I like to order at Vietnamese restaurants. Pork sausage was cooked nicely, full of flavour and spice. Overall, standard vermicelli dish. I was glad they didn't load up on veggies like most restaurants.

Pho with rare beef and beef balls - Noodles was decent, but standard. Broth was clear and tasted nice. Beef portion was decent. Overall, nothing spectacular, but also not bad either.

Good for a quick fix if you're in one of the 11 locations they have around Toronto."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. It was not bad, the pho was pretty tasty.  The service was fast.  Run by real Vietnamese so you know it was pretty authentic."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I live nearby this restaurant. The food has always been fast and fresh and absolutely delish."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Pho 99, but I have not found another place that is on the same level as 99, in all areas.  The pho here was actually pretty good.  I also liked how they have small bowls for $1, perfect for kids.  That is about the only things I liked. If you have little kids that requires high chairs, be aware they only have 2 available.

They were serving cold tea, which I assumed and was confirmed it was due to the hot weather. But still...if I wanted cold tea, I'd get a iced tea.. There was 1 lady that was friendly and engaging to the customers, the other 2 seemed like they were bored out of their minds. When they do speak, they whisper.  They don't really walk around to check on the customers. When there is nothing to serve or clean, they seem to just sit there.   I went up to the counter to pay as the friendly server was behind the cash doing stuff, and the other 2 was just sitting down. Much easier that way and get us out faster.

We ordered 2 phos and a chicken fried rice, and the fried rice was absolutely bland.  It almost seemed like they just put white rice and veg/chx in a bowl, without the fried part.  GF is a bit picky so she usually picks stuff out of her  pho/food.  This time, as she went and scoop something out of the pho, she picked up a dead bug.  When we showed this to 1 of the servers who barely spoke, there was absolutely no shock and any kind of expression on her face.  Just whispered she will get a new one, which we declined and just asked not to charge us. She was even going to leave the bowl on the table, until I asked to take it away."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from outside... Truthfully the whole area is ugly, depressing strip malls. 
Inside the soup/pho is very good. 
Staff moves quickly, want you in and out. 
Would return."}
{"text":"A childhood favorite. On Sundays after church, my parents always brought my brother and I here to eat pho. To this very day, it is still my favorite place to get pho. I would recommend getting the pho dac biet, which is their house special pho. You get an assortment of meats such a tendon, tripe, beef balls etc. Also their bun thit nuong is great too. A lot of flavor and there are variations on the types of bun you can get. 

Pro:
- large variety in menu 
- Price is fair for the portion you get ($6-$10 for entree dishes 
- lots of parking spots available 

Con:
- depending on the day it can be overly packed"}
{"text":"I searched up Vietnamese restaurants in the area and discovered this restaurant. Upon entering, this restaurant was a typical Vietnamese restaurant in the area. It is a casual environment. 

Service: this was adequate. Not much service needed after the server hands you a pot of tea and your food. 

Food: I ordered the grilled pork with shredded pork and steamed egg on rice. As I was eating my shredded pork, I found a long strand of HAIR in my food!!!!! For those who had Vietnamese shredded pork, you would understand how hard it is to see a strand of hair in the food so the kitchen staff probably did not notice before they served the food. However I question how clean they are in the kitchen and whether they take proper procedures in the kitchen. I told the staff and he just told me he will give me a new one... and I just said no thanks because I just don't trust their batch of shredded pork anymore ...

In terms of food. It was okay. But I would obviously not return after finding that long strand of hair in my food. I don't assess a business based on food only, I assess it based on personal hygiene procedures in the kitchen and unfortunately this business did not gain my trust."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, great service, and good food. One of the best in the city."}
{"text":"In a shady complex and neighbourhood. Decor is lacking.  However, the food is great! My go to place for pho, authentic and tasty. Great fruit shakes, coffee, and dessert.  Don't let the decor deter you from going."}
{"text":"Came in a very busy Thanksgiving Monday. I was happy to see the place was super busy because I've never seen it packed full with people waiting at the door. The owner looked surprised as well as he had to be in charge of assigning customers to tables. He also had to go back into the kitchen and help out due to the traffic of the crowd. 

As I've said in my last review, this is my go-to Pho restaurant because they're fast, good and an easy cheap/filling meal. I came with my family and even though it was quite busy we were seated very fast. We ordered immediately because we knew we probably had to wait for the food to come out. And good thing too because our food came within 5 minutes of ordering! I ordered my usual, Bun Bo Hue, and my parents ordered a meat variation of pho. Mine had an abundance of meat (without bone) and the soup was piping hot, perfect for this wacky cold weather. Out of all pho restaurants I've been to around Mississauga, this has been the most consistent. Waitresses are nice and fast, never any issues with service. 

I definitely prefer their Bun Bo Hue to their pho and I haven't ordered anything else other than noodle soup there so I can only speak for that one dish. I'll be a regular for years to come still!"}
{"text":"The best pho place I've been to was in KW with the same name.  My friend and I have been searchign for a Pho Dau Bo in our area for some good pho.  We've been to three different ones in Kitchener and they have never failed us.  It was great here too!  

Too far out in terms of location from the suburbs -- but I guess it was worth the drive!   I was quite a happy camper."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed going to Pho Dau Bo. It's saddening that the closest one to my place is in Scarborough. But it's okay! I'll make the trip because it's worth it. 

I have been to Vietnam, and Pho Dau Bo's food is very close, if not the same, to what I experienced in Saigon and Hanoi. \"Authentic\" is the word that came to mind. Their pho broth is so tasty and refreshing. So fitting for a cold winter day. Their vermicelli options are also good. I love their fried spring rolls and the grilled meat that come with the vermicelli. 

Bottom line is, if you want an original authentic Vietnamese food, Pho Dau Bo is your go to restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is the best Pho restaurant I've ever been to in the GTA. They've never skimped on meat and I've been a customer for a year now. Their coffee on condensed milk is the best I've had at a pho place. Service is really quick whether it is busy or not. Lastly, it's the only pho restaurant I know in my area that's open until 11 and that extra hour or two really helps!"}
{"text":"Pho Dau Bo is an awesome and inexpensive Vietnamese restaurant to grab a quick lunch or have a casual restaurant outing with friends. Pho Dau Bo is a chained restaurant with locations in many Ontario cities, I've been to the location at Kitchener, and I feel this Mississauga location is pretty consistent in terms of quality.

Environment:
There is good amount of free parking space at the plaza. 
The restaurant interior is decent size, though the tables aren't very large, so I would suggest coming in a group of 4 of fewer. This isn't the most well-renovated restaurant and probably not the cleanest (the tables are kinda oily), so I'm deducting a point here. However, given the price point of Pho Dau Bo...you get what you pay for. 

Food:
Generally people come here for its Vietnamese soup noodles, but if you want something else, they also have a really large selection of rice and stir fry. The dishes are less than $10 for the most part, so it's a really great deal. I've been here multiple times during weekday lunch and the restaurant is 80% full, so it is a popular workday lunch spot.
I get the house special Vietnamese soup noodles every time, it has rare beef, beef tendon, beef meat ball, and beef tripe, with some mint, bean spouts, and lemon on the side. As a small girl, a size S is plenty to fill me for lunch and there is a good amount of meats in there. From what I know, the only difference between the size S and size M is the amount of noodles, so if you're looking for more meats, go for the size L. From my experience, I'm not thirsty after eating here, so I'm fairly certain they don't use MSG in the soup :)

Service:
Alright Asian restaurant service. When you're ready to order you put your order down on a piece of paper to avoid any misunderstanding. There is very minimal interaction between the server and the customer after they takes your order paper and delivers your food. 
You go up to the counter to pay, and they either cash and debit."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite pho restaurant to ever go to. The food, atmosphere, pricing are all amazing! My fiancé and I go here sometimes on a weekly basis for lunch, we are always craving it. Their spring rolls is so delicious. I always get the chicken pho I'm not a red meat type of person, but the chicken pho is amazing and it isn't salty. After having a baby I really had to cut down on unhealthy food and I chose pho to stick with it's not to bad than other fast foods out there. I've been to a lot of pho restaurants and most of them are either too salty, the atmosphere is not the cleanliest, long waits, etc.. So this one is my favourite and I highly recommend. :)"}
{"text":"I always go to Pho Dau Bo at least once at any location, but I've been to this location the most so I'll write my short and sweet review here. 

FAST service for pretty good food. Recommended."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place twice in one week it was soo good! Pho is Pho, but my favourite part is the speed of the service. You can sit, order, eat and pay all withinw 20 minutes. It is also very affordable, very clean and very accomodating to people who don't know what to order or how even use chopsticks.

I will for sure come back for thirds!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid and this is my favourite Vietnamese restaurant. The restaurant is very authentic and so tasty.

Pros:
- Food: The food that comes out is consistent and really good. The Pho is flavourful and always tastes the same. The Vermicelli dishes are always so tasty and flavourful. The food here reminds me a lot of what my family made for me growing up. So yummy See below for list of foods I recommend eating!
- Parking: Always tons of parking in the plaza. During busy times, you may have to park a little further, but there is always room. 
- Price: Price per person will usually be $10 or less, depending on what you order. 
- Service: The servers are very nice!  


Foods I Like: 
- Pho Ga (Chicken Rice Noodle Soup) - Chicken is not dry at all and is very tender
- Pho Dac Biet (Special Assorted Beef Rice Noodle Soup (rare beef, well-done flank, soft tendon, beef tripe & beef balls) - This has basically all the meats, so see which ones you like and go throughout. I personally love a bit of everything). 
- Bun Thit Nuong Bi (Vermicelli with Grilled Pork, Shredded Pork & Peanut) - This has lots of variations, so feel free to browse the menu and see what toppings you like 
- Cha Gio (Vietnamese Style Spring Roll with Salad) - Great appetizer amongst friends! Deep fried spring rolls is so yummy! 
- Goi Cuon Tom (Vietnamese Style Shrimp Salad Rolls) - Great appetizer as well if your not feeling for something deep fried."}
{"text":"This used to be the best pho place in Toronto. Now it is just disappointing. The pho broth is separated. The cuts of meat are low quality. The pho ga is just bad cuts of chicken in beef broth."}
{"text":"This place is super ghetto but it's really good. I had the BBH soup and my fiancé had the pho special. I would recommend BBH soup here. It's hard to find a place that makes it good."}
{"text":"One thing you want to see at a restaurant is that it is super busy during lunch time. And yes, this restaurant was packed when we got there at 12:30...good sign.

FOOD
I had my same pho with rare beef, beef intestine (they say it more eloquently on the menu).  The broth was good, the noodles seemed fresh, meat portion was decent. good sign

What lacked was the portion sizes were smaller than the typical Pho restaurant and side dishes. The mint leaves were so few and they only gave us 1 of the other green leaf (I don't know what it's called) when it was two of us at the table.  There were no red hot chili peppers. Bad sign.

I had an avocado shake and it did not have that wonderful avocado and condensed milk taste.  It was basically just a cold drink with ice bits in it b/c it wasn't blended very well. My friend had the durian shake and he said that it tasted like powdered durian, not fresh durian. bad sign.

SERVERS
The servers were quick as usual. The only problem I had was that they left the menus on our table and it took up room when we were eating.  They should have taken the menu from us.

COSTS
The prices are fairly typical. $4.50 (S), $5.50 (M), $6.50 (L), $7.50 (XL). I could be off by $0.50 but it was about that price. So nice and cheap.

CROWD
When I looked around, I noticed the place was full of caucasian and indian people. There were asian people but I was just so surprised to see about half the room with blond/brown hair. lol

KICKER
So the reason why this place got a 2 was that I became sick after my meal. Not horribly sick but I had the runs. I had stomach pains as soon as we left and went to the bathroom about 3 times that afternoon.

SICK RATING : 2
1 (just a little sick) to  5 (Emergency, I think i have a parasite)"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourites 

It looks like a hole in the wall but it's fantastic 

Only issue today it was pretty salty 

But regularly it's proper

EDIT: I have a fish allergy and I told them to make sure my
Food didn't get contaminated. It did! A 7$ meal turned into a 300$ meal (epi Pens are expensive) I won't be back just for that factor I thought something was off when I was eating my pho didn't notice the reaction till half way through"}
{"text":"It's a Vietnamese chain, this one being the first location.

They do pho right, with about 15 variations dedicated to this clear broth soup. This time I ordered rare beef and well done flank, while my dad ordered the well done flank, soft tendon and beef tripe with a large order of crispy spring rolls.

Taste 
Service 
Cleanliness"}
{"text":"as the others review says, its amazing. so im not going to be talking about how great the pho is cause everyone else is already doing that. the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that sometimes i could taste the detergent they used while wiping or cleaning the bowls spoons or chopsticks with. it throws off the taste but i usually either just switch utensil and itll be fine or ill cleanit down with tea :)"}
{"text":"This is a small local chain of Vietnamese Restaurants that are very basic.  If u didn't know this place existed you'd drive right past it. The lunch is a great combo...good & cheap. I had special 474. It was noodles + salad + pork + Pork roll. All in all is was solid & a great place. Give it a try."}
{"text":"The food volume is a lot for the pho, which is pretty sweet. Nothing impressive though. I tried a lot of their dishes, and none of them caught my attention."}
{"text":"I wasn't gonna write a review 'cause you KNOW what it is.  It's pho, vermicelli, broken rice, spring rolls, & when you have extra change in your pocket, drinks.  And this is the pho chain with a logo that bears an uncanny resemblance to that of \"La vache qui rit\" cheese.

Prices were, like most pho places, very reasonable.  Small pho was more than enough for me.  I think it was like $5.25 or something.  Bonus for the sliced up banana peppers...they were spicy!!!  ;)

What loses *s at this place is the service.  2 menus for 4 people, really?  You hafta give them your order sheet AND go up to the cash to pay when you're done?  So there's obviously some list of unwritten customs at this particular location that first-timers wouldn't know about.  Plus a coupla orders at the table were wrong, but it wasn't mine, ha ha.  ;)

My usual place has no such 'rules', so I'm used to a bit more service.  Yes, even for pho!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here with my family for a good 11 years now. This is by far the best pho I've ever had anywhere. This location specifically makes the best rare beef pho. I have tried their other locations (Brampton, Hamilton) and they pale in comparison. 

Their soup isn't oily (unless you go there at the very end of the day...), and they are very generous with the amount of beef they give you. They've been updating their restaurant throughout the years, eventually getting their logo onto all their utensils so you know where you're eating. The servers are friendly, just flag them down. 

There is always a weekday rush during lunch hours. I try to get there after it ends because waiting while smelling their pho is excrutiating. You may have to line up in between their two glass doors - the waiting area is quite tiny...

Take out is also the same quality you get at the restaurant. If I don't plan on eating it right away, I freeze the rare beef and then just boil it later with the soup before dumping the noodles in. Very few places can offer take out that is restaurant quality, but this place does it...Pho Dau Bo Finch, thanks for 11 years of great pho!"}
{"text":"Got bun vermicelli.  If you're into beef jerky. That's exactly it.  The spring roll it came with was weird too

Meh edible. But not tasty."}
{"text":"My first trip to Toronto I ate here, and second trip I ate on Dundas. This one seems to have better broth and service is also better. Their bun and Pho here are both really really top notch.  The Pho broth is very tasty, so tasty that I am inclined to just chug it down. The portions are big and well priced. 

The service here is pretty good. They are always smiling and friendly. Pho is definely better in Toronto during winter. Brrrrzzzzzz"}
{"text":"OG Vietnamese cuisine restaurant. I've been eating here all my life with my family, but not so much anymore :(. Great place to go to with your friends the morning after, after a long night of drinking. Great food, atmosphere, and customer service!"}
{"text":"It's a common fact that Mississauga has a strong presence of Pho Vietnamnese, and I present one of my 1st reviews for the Mississauga area regarding pho places.

Pho Dau Bo has been always a favourite of mine, although in recent years, it was a franchise that I stopped going simply because 99 was closer to my house and I started going to places like Golden Turtle.  This is a franchise that I've started coming back to since my parents oddly started going to this place, so I just naturally tagged along.

Just like most pho places, do not expect quality service as this is place more on the food itself and the value paid.  But if I must mention service, they're fine.  They're nice, not exactly the most friendly people but they do get their job done. I will say that the decor is a bit dull and from the outside it doesn't look all that inviting.  

So because I've had pho and rice (although I strongly recommending anyone that goes to get their rice dishes, broken rice FTW), I decided to take a different route and order a Hu Tieu (sp?) - #212.  It was a dish that I wanted to order because as a person who watches Masterchef, I was intrigued by this Hu Tieu dish that Gordon Ramsey presented on an episode.  He first had this dish when he himself in Vietnam and the presentation of it looked stunning, so I said to myself....why not?!

So the Hu Tieu comes in a large bowl (there's only one size of it, so you have to tell the waitress you want a large, and it comes a $1 more).  I think the regular price is $7.25 or something like that and it comes with seafood and BBQ Pork (cha siu).  The large bowl is also present with a shrimp cracker (see pic).  So presentation wise, it's STUNNING to look at it because there's so many little components in it.  You have the fried onions, to the green onions, to a variation of other vegetables to put it in, including your typical mint and bean sprouts.  The broth is SUPER clear which is a really good sign, indicating that they've properly strained the broth multiple times.  And it's tasty without having that MSG feeling, at least I didn't get that horrid numb feeling when I do eat MSG.  There's a subtle sweetness to the broth and it's really comforting to eat.  I almost may consider eating this over pho ANY day.  The pho noodles that were in it, were just slightly overcooked...but the noodles still kept their structural integrity to it.  The dish is just freakishly awesome, but I do think the semi low point of it, was probably the shrimp cracker.  Not to say that it was bad, but it was just an oily deep fried cracker...even though I drizzled some lime juice to cut through that richness.  It's perhaps something that's just not my cup of tea.

Overall, I love this place.  The prices are super cheap and reasonable, and I can confirm that they have awesome rice dishes and Hu Tieu.  Next time I go, I'll probably have the pho just so I can get the big picture of this place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this pho place. Everything is fresh and the flavour never fails. It's a great go to for quick meals or just for a little warm fuzzy feeling in your tummy. 
#330 is my favourite."}
{"text":"Good pho. As their neighbor's name might suggest this place has no frill's.  Just good tasty food for damn cheap.  Can't go wrong if you like Vietnamese food, if you're looking for Thai I'd look somewhere else. One thing they are missing is the mango salad the Brampton location had.  Would go again. Doesn't hurt I'm 2 mins away."}
{"text":"I enjoyed our dinner. The service was fast and the food was tasty and not to forget the price was cheap."}
{"text":"Hi..

I just let you know...
When you pay via credit card or debit....BE Careful...
They just charged twice..And they told me they did once..But not..
I had to go again to refund......
Just BE careful...."}
{"text":"One of the best I've ever had, almost as good as the mother in-law's and that's saying a lot. Wish we lived closer, maybe they will open one in London."}
{"text":"Delicious and generous portions! The prices are reasonable and the service is fast. However, no customer service skills at all."}
{"text":"This place is my husband and I's #1 pho/Vietnamese spot in Toronto. We'd come here probably every week if it weren't for the location. There are two in Toronto, this one is closest to my parent's house but it's still far (nearest intersection is Weston & Finch). 

We get the same things every time: a large pho with rare beef, brisket and tripe, a Vermicelli salad with either grilled pork or chicken, a small plate of spring rolls. Whatever variety of pho you get, the broth is outstanding. Not overly salty and one-note like a lot of other places, beef broth with real DEPTH, and they have the proper flat noodles. The vermicelli also has the perfect balance between the noodles, lettuce, pickled cucumber and carrot. Add in the fish sauce, good balance with the saltiness, fishiness, sourness of the sauce and the freshness of the salad. Finally, the spring roll is perfectly crispy, made to order, good ratio of meat to vegetables inside, and a good size for the price.

This place recently has gone up in price (on average I think $0.25 on each item) but it's still a great place with the best pho broth. The vermicelli also has changed with the thick round noodles instead of the flat vermicelli noodles. My husband hates this but I don't mind. I definitely tell everybody about this place when I get the chance!"}
{"text":"If you read my last review, you'll know that I love this restaurant. It's the best authentic Vietnamese in Toronto. 
We always order 2 - 3 dishes when dining in and 4 more for take-out. They give us the right herbs for our pho (which others rarely do), the rice combos are extensive and their appetizers are all delicious. 
My go to dishes are:
- Banh beo bi
- Banh cuon (with/without sausage)
- Com thap cam (grilled pork, grilled chicken, shredded pork, steamed egg, fried egg)
- and of course PHO!
The restaurant is family friendly and service is quick. Food is always fresh and everyone working there speaks Vietnamese."}
{"text":"One of my all time fave Vietnamese joints... don't be fooled by the decor or the location I promise it's well worth it for the flavour. 

My go to recommendations are:

-the fried spring rolls made fresh in house and served with a delectable fish oil sauce, 

-the shredded pork bowl that comes with salad, spring roll and noodles

-and obviously the rare beef noodle soup 

Portions are crazy generous so I recommend getting a few dishes and eating picnic style with the family so everyone can share a bit of each dish (that's how we roll ) very inexpensive and the flavours can't be beat."}
{"text":"Hands down best pho in Toronto - yet :) 

Love love love their pho. Definitely give it a try folks"}
{"text":"Looking for authentic franchise Vietnamese resto? This is it. 

I have been going to pho dau bo for over 20 years at their flagship store located on finch just west of Weston Rd and it had never disappoint. 

Their food is very tasty, consistent and well priced. Their smoothies and Vietnamese coffee are so good.  They use a really good chunk of real fruits in their smoothies so you can actually taste the fruit. 

My favourite is their Bun Cuon and pho with rare beef and beef balls. Their bun with nam nuong is also worth trying if you like Vietnamese BBQ sausage. 

It would have been a 5 star rating if their restaurants were a bit cleaner and more modernly furnished but that will be wishful thinking."}
{"text":"Excellent food,Quick service and good portions! Conveniance prices!
All soups and noodles are Excellent very authentic Vietname food! Come with friends and family"}
{"text":"We've been to this location of Pho Dau Bo many times over the past few years. There are a few things that keep us coming back. There are also a few things that we'd like to see change if we had our way.

First of all, the washrooms are pretty run down. They're fairly clean, but are in dire need of a spruce up.

The food in general is good, but I wish they'd change their fryer oil more often. We don't order much fried food, but sometimes we get a dish that has spring rolls or shrimp in beancurd included and it always tastes just a little like the oil needs changing.

Okay, those are the negatives. Now to the positives :) The pho broth is very tasty and doesn't give me that MSG reaction that I get at other Vietnamese restaurants. I take this to mean that they use less of the stuff in their soups. Even the small portion is very generous when it comes to the amount of meat. Their other soups are also very tasty and generous in portions of protein.

The rice dishes that we've tasted have all been very good. Their steamed egg is always tasty and nice and moist (not dried out like it is in some places). Their grilled meats (pork and chicken) are usually well-grilled with a nice amount of lemongrass flavour. 

The vermicelli bowls have plenty of vegetables and mint included and the noodles are of the thicker kind (we don't mind that) unlike traditional vermicelli.  

The service is quick and servers are friendly.  All in all, it's a solid 3-star Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Certainly not the best pho in the city, in fact it is pretty average, you have about 60% of finding the same quality at a random restaurant that has \"pho\" in its name.

Broth: Not super clear, as if they have forgotten to take the scum of boiling beef, while finishing the bowl we saw bits and bits of impurities. The taste is Ok, I prefer to go heavier on star anise then you can really tell it is pho and not just the beef bouillon.

Meat: Is plentiful, which is great and they cook it as per your instructions.

Noodles: Fine and pretty standard, well cooked, but they put less of them per bowl than other places I have been to.

Condiments and veggies: Fresh and plentiful. Their hoisin is very good.

MSG: Yes they do add it, I would say average amount. My MSG meter was closer to medium than to light.

We went to check the space because a few yelpers and reviewers from other sites claimed there wasn't any MSG in this pho (the quest of my life), turns out they were wrong. Once my MSG meter went up the cook confirmed my fears that they indeed do use MSG. So really there is no point for me to come to this sketchy district and I would not recommend it to anyone, unless you are on the go and in very desperate need of pho."}
{"text":"My fave. place for Pho in the city. 
Close friends of mine and my wife have been going to this place since we graduated from Guelph - Humber. The costs are great, the broth for the Pho (beef with beef balls my fave) is off the charts. 

I have since moved to Brampton, bought a house and then noticed there was a Pho Dau Bo by my house!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for many years now. This is my favourite Pho place! The service is great, owner is very friendly and the food is amazing! Thought the appearance of the place isn't the best, the food is. You can never go wrong with any pho, vermicelli or chicken and rice. All personal favourites! Will always recommend this place"}
{"text":"3.6
Ok pho but not flabbergasted."}
{"text":"Great Pho! This joint got flavour! I always get the spring rolls, a large Pho bowl to share, and a rice dish and never leave this place hungry! I always tend to order more food at Pho spots because they are cheaper and will hit the right spot! 

This place can become really packed if you go on a Friday and Saturday so I try to get there around 7pm which always is a good time for me cuz I end up staying till 8pm when rush hour hits

They get your food out really quick and I've never had a complaint about this spot. One of my go to Pho joints"}
{"text":"Came here today and ordered  rare beef pho with tripe and bbq chicken and pork with egg and rice. A+ for the pho. Very flavourful and big portion for $10 plus. The bbq meat and rice was a let down. Meat is dry and i didnt enjoy the plate. Should listen to my gut and just order pho. Most patrons ordered soup.
Between Pho Da Bo and Pho Metro in Scarborough. I still prefer Pho Metro in Lawrence and Warden due to all their dish are delicious with good price and big portions."}
{"text":"Located on the west side of North York, Pho Dau Bo has been in business a long time and a local favourite for many. The atmosphere is really casual and people are usually here for quick in and out food. Service is typical of Asian restaurants where they leave you alone and you need to call upon them if you need anything.

The decor is dated and typical of older Pho establishments, laminated tables and low end dining chairs on tiled floors. Utensils and napkins are self serve and stocked at your table along with Sriracha (hot) and Hoisin (sweet) sauces.

The menu is redone, and the only difference I've noticed is a new page of Extras and Small Side orders (things like extra meat, fried egg, etc.). They always offered this but was never advertised on the menu, you just asked and they gave for a nominal charge ($1-$3). I guess that demand was high enough to warrant them as menu items, so they added them officially, and (of course) increased the price ($3-$5). Prices for all other offerings have also crept up as well (probably to account for inflation and/or increased profit margins).

I didn't feel like Pho today so I opted for Hu Tieu (clear noodle soup), Com (Rice dish), Cha Gio (spring rolls), and Sinh To Mang Cau (Soursop Milkshake).

#101. Cha Gio. Deep fried spring rolls. Traditionally served with lettuce, carrots, radish, cucumber, noodle, fish sauce. I typically make a lettuce wrap out of this dish, then dip it into the fish sauce. The Spring rolls shrunk by 1/3 in size (length and girth) and they used the wrong wrapping (spring roll vs rice roll). The filling also changed and eliminated the ground pork bits!. This was a crucial element to the flavour of the dish. The fish sauce is equally as important as the entire dish combined. Luckily it was still pretty decent, and for that I'm giving it 2 stars.

#212. Hu Tieu My Tho. This soup for this dish is completely different from Pho. In fact, you shouldn't taste any Pho flavour at all. Hu Tieu is actually Cambodian, but seeing as they're neighbours, it's not unlikely that the South Vietnamese would have their own version of it. But the premise is the same, pork bones and seafood. The My Tho comes with glass noodles. Like Pho, this noodle is all about the soup, and the soup here didn't disappoint. The soup actually has a lot more goodies to it than meets the eye, pork bits and rinds sink to the bottom, but if you fish them out, they're packed with flavour! If you've never had Hu Tieu, I highly recommend; however, you may want to start out with the egg noodles, which come with the Hu Tieu Dac Biet (special), and the Hu Tieu Mi. 4 stars.

#468. Com Tam Ga Nu'Ong, Su'On Nu'Ong, Op-La. Grilled chicken, grilled pork chop, fried egg, on steamed rice. Served with carrots, radish, tomato wedges, cucumber, and topped with green onion in oil, the dish was as good as I remembered it. The egg was over easy as it should be. The meats were flavourful with subtle hints of lemon grass, grilled nicely and not dried out. 4 stars.

#799. Sinh To Mang Cau. Soursop Blended Drink. This was a huge disappointment. The shake was watery, and lacked soursop fruit. The recipe was either new or not followed. It's among the top 5 worse I've had. 1 star.
Most of the shakes are made with the same proportions, and usually done by the same person, so I'd stay away from them all. Now, it may be that they're just having a bad day, but it's a gamble you'd have to decide to make... feeling lucky?

This is my fallback place when I'm craving Pho and in the area. Sad to say, I think they've degraded a little based on my latest experience. I'll probably give them another shot on the off chance that the kitchen was just having a bad day. There is competition within the same plaza just a few doors down, but I don't recall that place being very good. If my next experience is just as bad, I just may give it try to see how the competition stacks up. The combo of downgraded food and increased prices definitely left a bad taste in my mouth this time around... 3 stars for Pho Dau Bo.

{"text":"I was driving around looking for gas and went way further than i had wanted to before I finally found the gas station. While adding the fuel to my car, i looked up and realized where I was. 

Even though I was alone, I decided I had to eat at Pho Dau Bo anyway. It's not everyday I get to come out North-West and eat one of the most popular Pho places among the Vietnamese people i know in the GTA.

Even the flies in the restaurant didn't deter me from enjoying my pho.

$5 for a small Pho: CHEAP
Giant portion for a small pho: I forced myself to finish it anyway!
Was I uncomfortably pholl afterward? Yes
Did I regret it? No

Then I went grocery shopping at the supermarket next door to work off the discomfort."}
{"text":"Favorite pho + mango salad place. Soup is well seasoned, portion is big, small size pho is enough even if you're super hungry."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Pho in the GTA. Had also the deep fried spring rolls and they were awesome and not dry like so many other establishments. Definitely coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"Pho is decent for me at this restaurant. They don't have large selection like other restaurants. They have Pho and Com Tam and Bun Bo Hue. There are not a lot vemicelli dishes to choose. 
I usually order Pho here. The grilled pork from Com Tam is very dry here. I hope this could be improved. 

Overall, it's a decent restaurant that I usually go for quick lunch. Other than that, nothing is really special here."}
{"text":"Pho Dau Bo's Pho is Not the best Pho I ever ate... but it is A-OK. 

Pho Dau Bo's is like a chain Vietnamese Restaurant which have over 11 locations.. I been to the Scarborough's location which I found it is not too good compare to this North York's location. 

It was quite quiet during evening dinner time. My Special Pho ($6) arrived in recorded time... 15 counting breaths and my bowl of goodness arrived!! Nice smelling aroma of beef...soup is quite clear but has good flavour. 

The noodle is the dried type, but well cooked and tasted decent. I like how the rare beef came out RARE!!! Thank You! 

Service is fast and indifferent... good place to a fast pho fix!"}
{"text":"I would give them a 5* but I did find the broth a bit on the salty side. However the flavours were on point, rich like how real pho broth should taste. The spring rolls were decent not too oily for deep fried food. The fresh rolls with shrimp and pork also good, pork was sliced thin enough unlike some places too thick. The plus side is that they close at 11pm which works for me as I don't get off work some nights until 10/10:30pm. Better than grabbing a fast food chain meal  Definitely a repeat place especially when craving something to warm the tummy at 10pm."}
{"text":"This pho is worth the trek from Downtown...by car at least.

Pho Dac Biet is delicious, the tendon was so soft. Even the Spring Rolls were a surprise....why were they so good?

The reasonable cost seals the deal. Just go there."}
{"text":"The Pho Dau Bo restaurant I went to is located in a small plaza near Weston and Finch. There are 4 other Pho Dau Bo restaurants in the GTA and 3 other ones outside the GTA in the Kitchener-Waterloo area.

The restaurant was what I expected of a Pho restaurant, small, with about 15 or so tables that either seat 2 or 4, condiments and utensils ready at every table, till at the front.

I normally order the Pho dac biet and spring rolls because I enjoy being basic at times... but hey, you can't go wrong with the Special, and without the spring rolls the meal just doesn't seem complete.

Service was quick and to the point. It probably took 5 mins for the food to arrive, then again, we didn't order anything superfluous.

Overall, the restaurant is exactly what you would expect of a Vietnamese pho restaurant chain (such as 88 or pho xe lua), quick to the point service and decent food!

It's a great place if you're looking for a quick bite to eat and in the mood for pho."}
{"text":"Typical hole in the wall restaurant, nothing fancy. Bathroom passably clean, lots of fake flowers for decor. 

Condiments are more varied than most pho restaurants, with chili peppers and pickled peppers in addition to the usual hoisin and Sriracha. 

I had the seafood soup with glass noodles and shrimp cracker. It was fast, hot and good.

I'll be sure to stop here again when in the area, with a taste for pho."}
{"text":"Super busy restaurant. Typical Vietnamese pho joint. Lots of options for pho. The pho dac biet is my go to. Good flavours broth, meat was tasty and fresh. Service is efficient but not too friendly. Quick cheap eats lacks warmth."}
{"text":"I remember when they first opened up a location near my house because I went there pretty often for lunch. However, now that there are more competitors around my area, I just haven't went to Pho Dau Bo as often. The last time I went was last month and I am glad that their food still tastes great!

I ordered the broken rice with grilled chicken and egg. Btw, most restaurants don't serve you broken rice...just the regular rice. I have to say that broken rice tastes better! My sister ordered the pho dac biet and I got to taste the broth (which I usually do), it tasted fresh and hot! The broth was clear which means it hasn't been sitting on the stove for a long time and it's fresh. 

The service here is fast and the servers will come to you only if you need something...pretty typical for all Vietnamese restaurants.

I should drop by Pho Dau Bo sometime since I've been visiting Pho Mi 99 too often haha!"}
{"text":"I've seen the logo and the name of this place around places.  I never been to any of them, but if I client wants to treat you to lunch...you go.

The place is unremarkable - both inside and out.  The food is also unremarkable.  Just A-OK.
I usually do a thorough write up when I do reviews and try to find humour, facts, and other nuggets of wisdom, however, I can't really find a lot to things to say here.

It's PHO...Noodles in a hot broth with thin meats that cook in the broth.  The broth is full of MSG and I was drying from the inside out the whole afternoon.  The meat was edible and I was hungry once again - in about a hour.

I find pho ideal on cool and damp days and you need a pick me up.  It was one of those days.

As a place to return, I might if my client goes again - it is his favourite place, otherwise, no.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I've been here a few times. I've always thought of this place as a fairly decent standard Pho place. Great location in the odd quiet neighborhood: minutes from Lee's Badminton.

I was here on a Wednesday night at 9:30p. We ordered Pho and that came in within 5 mins. Very fast. However the vegetables were not fresh, the beef was just like a gigantic lump of meat (inseparable) and the noodles were overcooked to the point of being soggy. I was too tired to care anyway. To add on top of that they started mopping the floor at 10p and the smell of detergent just makes your appetite off putting.

I think this place is a hit and miss late at night. Maybe I caught them at a bad time. The lady making food was eating her dinner at the time too. It deserves 2 stars because my previous experiences were better. I was full nonetheless."}
{"text":"Oh My God, Authentic As They Come. The Pho soup is so  good, the beef broth pictured is so flavourful. One tip I can suggest avoid lunch Hours as tables get pretty full fast, I've eaten my share of Pho soups, but this one hands down you think your in the East"}
