{"text":"Wow!! Las Vegas. This Angie's Corner Cafe is an excellent restaurant in town. The chefs Angie and Richard are very pleasant and best of all they serve you BIG PORTIONS.  I love their T-BONE STEAK and all the trimmings that come with it. Also breakfast is amazing. Angie makes huge pancakes I have ever eating. I have been going to this restaurant religiously everything Saturday since opening. I really really recommend this restaurant. Oh, by the way it's VERY clean and rated A rating by the city. Please Angie and Richard KEEP up the excellent service you are doing. See you soon next Saturday."}
{"text":"First timer and I must say you definitely get a lot of food for what you pay for. Service was GREAT very welcoming home feel . Angie and her family were awesome. Will definitely be back . :)"}
{"text":"We love Angie's!! Home cooked comfort food served in a warm and cozy family like setting. Faith, food and love all come together here."}
{"text":"This place deserves no star but unfortunately at the place one just by the rules ... call myself taking  my grandfather to go eat there got there 30 minutes early and waited till 915 and they still wasn't open. As well as I called and no answer as it connects you to a cell phone number."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! Don't miss out on this place... you'll get the best home cooking and awesome service from the best two restaurant owners in town. Thanks Angie and Richard!"}
{"text":"Super cute!!! The place felt like we stepped back in time...in Texas.  The hubby is from Texas so this was a treat.   We had the homemade chicken strips and homemade steak strips.  Delicious.  Definitely comfort food.  Met the owner/chef/server Angie...what a doll. Felt like hanging out with an old friend.    Nothing fancy...just good comfort food and great conversation."}
{"text":"Your Mama's kitchen! Great food and friendly owner. Reasonable prices! Definitely a must try when you don't want to wait 30-60 minutes elsewhere..."}
{"text":"What a nice little find. Small cute and great food. We went for breakfast and it was delicious"}
{"text":"This is a cute ma and pa restaurant for home cooking. They're so warm and friendly. Food is good, tasty and fresh. Hot salsa is great, I could just eat a bowl if it."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp & decided to give it a try. We will definitely be back. Nice & cozy. Food was great and so was the coffee!! My 5yr ate all her blueberry pancakes. She never does that. The owner was very warm & welcoming. If you are near by, check it out. Can't wait to try this place for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"I found this hidden gem and it is located across from Santa Fe Casino tucked away in a small strip of shops that I didn't know existed.  The place is decorated tastefully in Southern style. It made us feel like back in the south and also feel like I had stop somewhere outside Vegas on a road trip.  They serve delicious homemade country style food. Being from North Carolina, it reminds me of the many places there.   There was a little bit of a wait since everything are made fresh to order.  We had the Steak and eggs; Everything but the Sink and Chorizo & Egg Burrito.  Everything was made so flavorful and fresh. And to top it all, the price is so inexpensive.  The restaurant is family owned. The owner, I believe is Angie serves us and she is a delightful woman. I asked the young boy who also served us when the place was opened, he mentioned last October.  Such a great find! Looking forward in trying out their lunch menu.  Overall, a wonderful country home cooking!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast at this cafe this morning and it was mediocre at best. First, the coffee was lukewarm, the beacon cold and brittle, bread was un toasted. waitress/owner, didn't bother to inquire about my meal nor offer me a refill of my lukewarm coffee. The total of my meal, $9.20. I gave the lady $10.00, with no change offered. My wife was upset, especially about the proprietor keeping the change. I explained to my wife that my \"Tip\" would be given on yelp."}
{"text":"Great food!! Just like mom used to cook!! Its that stick to your ribs kinda food.  Its a great family atmosphere. Angie is always there to greet everyone with smile. Service is on point at angies!! Thats the place!!"}
{"text":"Great little homey breakfast place.  It's tucked in the parking lot behind the Santa Fe casino next to a large church.  As we stepped inside the owner came out send spoke to us and told us about herself and her restaurant. She was very welcoming and sat us down.   I had the pancakes, bacon, eggs, and sausage.   The girlfriend had an order of biscuits and gravy. And we shared some grits.   The pancakes were incredibly delicious and flaky. You could taste the buttermilk on them. Soooo good! We both agreed they were the best part.   I'm not a fan of biscuits and gravy but the GF is and she liked them very much. She said she really liked the biscuits.   The sausage patties and bacon were cooked perfectly and the waiter was very attentive. Overall it was a nice morning and a yummy breakfast.   We were invited to come back for dinner and we definitely will. La novia [GF in Spanish] wanted to try the chicken fingers, and I want a burger, so we will definitely be back.   Only drawback is that there was no tip option when paying with a credit card. So bring some tipping cash!"}
{"text":"Upon arriving I noticed this place screamed nostalgia. The ole lady and I proceeded to enter and was greeted by Angie. Angie is a very awesome soul, she made the whole experience worthwhile. We ordered and I purchased a chili cheese burger with fries. I like how the fries are homestyle and made in house, they tasted great! Angie's corner is complete comfort from the menu, the people and the atmosphere. I'll be back! GO TEXAS!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place about two weeks ago.  Now we are going back every weekend.      Angie makes everything from scratch.   Some of the best chili I've ever had.   For her chicken fried steak she even  hand breads them and the cornbread is also great.  Can't wait to try other things on the menu .   Husband Richard is a great person also. Really friendly folks and good home cooking.  You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"I was on my way to the Santa Fe and passed Angie's place and decided to stop in and try the place out and I am good I did. I really enjoyed my breakfast with my morning paper and though Angie and her staff were busy catering an event she still made time to talk to me.  Her husband was very friendly as well, I would like to mention I ordered some grits with my breakfast that didn't arrive with the other food but Angie was extremely busy with the large group that was starting to assemble and there was a slight delay.  I only mention this because she was very graceful and apologetic and offered me a sample of the smoked ribs they had prepared for the days special and let me tell you though I was completely full from breakfast I ate the whole thing when I got home......Great place I am planning to make a stop there weekly....  Cheers Keith"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere,  brought my 2 youngest boys in for breakfast. Being a small Mom and Pop shop we tried it. Let me tell you we weren't disappointed. It's very cozy and and friendly. The portions are huge and taste like some great down home cooking!! Definitely recommend coming in!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place and it has good potential however Mrs Angie needs some help. We sat there in the place while she cooked the people who was there before us food after they were gone we waited soooo long for our food.  When we finally got our food my container was so light i thought it was empty..lol you can tell it was rushed. My pancakes were the size of 2 silver dollars and ill just leave it at rushed.  Like i said it's a nice place and shes a nice lady but when you serve food you never know who and how many people you might have to feed on any given day."}
{"text":"Nice small restaurant with a quiet setting. If had a chance to meet Angie and she was exceptionally nice! If you are looking for a place that reminds you of home with great food go here. Pancakes or biscuits on a Saturday or Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"Excellent cafe close to Santa Fe Casino - had breakfast: homemade biscuits and gravy, giant bacon slices, delicious home fries."}
{"text":"I would give it no stars but I couldn't! I went on Yelp reviews and that just proves that you can't always trust those.  The food wasn't bad if you ever received it and the service was beyond horrible!!!!!!!!!  $35.00 later and I left hungry and wasted my hard earned money!  So many things were wrong that I would run out of space!"}
