{"text":"Fantastic service! The plates were great. We had a Cesar salade as an entrée and it was devine. The pizza was excellent and the linguine was good but too salty for me. The wine was pricy so was the S.Pellegrino. I will definitely come back for another supper! NB; reserve in advance!"}
{"text":"Very good Italian restaurant, on the upper scale. The calamaris were awesome. Very classy and formal setting. Good place for a birthday dinner, if you can afford it. The menu is more on the \"fancy\" side, than on the rustic italian side. It is very good, but certainly not light. I would suggest it for a special night."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite Italian restaurant! The food is absolutely delicious and the service is amazing! I have been going to this restaurant for over a decade and it just keeps getting better and better. This is my mother's favourite restaurant as well. I highly recommend it! They have a private group party room which has a flat screen tv, we celebrated my mother's birthday there a couple of years ago. It was a great decision! I've always had very enjoyable experiences here!!!"}
{"text":"Best Caesar salad and absolutely the best clam linguine I have ever had! Our server was primo. Never missed a beat but not obtrusive. Smooth Samuel! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is the best italian restaurant in the area. Everything on the menu is good. Always good service!"}
{"text":"It was my first time there with my daughter who had a terrific thin-crust marguerite pizza and I had a delicious shrimp plate for lunch.  Just that and a Diet Coke, came out to $70 for lunch.  Not cheap but the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Italian food. We had the risotto and it was hands down the best I ever had. It was on the Table d'Hote menu with vegetables, goat cheese and guinea fowl and it was just cooked to perfection. My friend had the half lobster on avocado with a saffron sauce, again tasty and spectacular. Even the foie gras au torchon beef tartar was to die for (I am usually not a fan of beef tartar, but there they do it really well). The food was tasty, the flavor of the few ingredients were showcase not hide under spices. The beef tartar especially was cut perfectly so you can really taste the meat and it was greatly seasoned. If you are looking for great food on the South shore, this is THE place to go."}
{"text":"J'ai découvert ce resto par l'entremise d'une amie. Délicieux , meilleur restaurant que j'ai pu goûter à date ... À essayer l'entrée de homard, plat principal medaglioni de foie gras et boeuf braisé et comme dessert demandez le pain doré!!! Le hors menu est aussi intéressant. Steak vieilli de 65 jours!! Malade!! Plateau d'huîtres fraîches. Le Proprio est presque toujours sur les lieux s'assurant ainsi du bon déroulement des choses ! Service super bien. On peu chic mais ne vous laissez pas impressionner car l'ambiance est très décontracté au bout du compte :)  Dommage que je reste sur l'île, ou bien par chance que je demeure aur l'île car j'aurais besoin d'un salaire supplémentaire  tellement j'iras souvent  :P sans alcool et service calculez un bon 130-150$ pour deux."}
{"text":"Great place. Good food, great service, good looking servers. Some need to smile more. Great ambiance especially at night. Romantic and cosy with good lighting. Clean and modern bathroom for ladies. Didn't see the men's :)  May 2017  Always good. Here twice this last week.  At bar tonight. Samuel is great!"}
{"text":"I'm changing my rating from 4 to 5 because I discovered that their vongole is the best one for me in greater Montreal! So update is needed!"}
{"text":"During the Grand Prix weekend my father and I have found it very difficult to find quality food in Montreal.  We suspect that because of the crowds, normally excellent restaurants are churning out sub-par food for above average prices.    Primi Piatti bucks that trend.    Desperate for high quality food, we ventured away from the city center and explored the beautiful St. Lambert neighborhood.  After a few positive reviews on Yelp we decided to try Primi Piatti.  We did not have a reservation, nor, embarassingly, were we properly attired, however the host Pino took pity and seated us in the outside patio area.  A quick review of the wine list revealed true taste and selection went into putting it together. While some wines that americans are accustomed to having inexpensively are a bit pricey due to import taxes, there are a number of excellent bottles under $50.  We selected the Cellar 8 Cab Sav. for $30.  The bottle was brought along with glasses proper to the wine.  A quick look around and I saw that every wine was being served in the glasses appropriate for that wine.  I also observed that most of the \"newer\" (2006 and up) vintage old world wines were poured through an aerator.  When our host Pino approached I mentioned my observations and he told us how he is a somolier and he ensures all of the staff is well versed by trying new wines every night.    Our waiters, Hubert and Pat, made very educated suggestions on their menu and were incredibly attentive and personable.  The ladies reading this will appreciate that every waiter in the house could model underwear as a side job.   The food delivered to our table was amazing.  I had a wood oven fired pizza with prosciutto and arugula and my father had the prix fix menu which included a creamy vegetable soup, the filet mignon and dessert.  The filet was perfectly fired and the accompanying veg and mash were nicely done.  My pizza was easily the best pizza I have had since Italy.  The food, wine and service was so exceptional that we returned there for dinner the following 2 nights, appropriately attired of course!  I can't recommend this restaurant more highly.    Finally I would like to thank Hubert, Pat and Pino for being so warm and welcoming.  I look forward to meeting you again."}
{"text":"Primi Piatti had a nice atmosphere, super helpful waiters, and great food. It's a little on the pricier side but it's good for a celebration"}
