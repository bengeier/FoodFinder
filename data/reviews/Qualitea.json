{"text":"I ordered the Roasted Oolong Milk Tea with Pearls. It was the most authentic taste of brewed tea from bbt shops I have ever tasted. The regular sweetness is perfect because it's about 50% sweetness of Chatime.  My husband and I both fell engulfed by the tea aroma that we actually decided to just sit there until we finished the entire drink.(this never happened before when we are on a date at a tea shop)"}
{"text":"The cheese topping might not sound appealing to some but it works! Got the Matcha tea with cheese, it was awesome and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"First cheese bubble tea shop in Toronto! Sounds funny, but it's awesome.  The \"cheese\" is light and fluffy, like a cheesecake-flavored whipped cream - and the fresh fruit juice teas (passion fruit, mango, watermelon, etc.) are great!   From traditional milk tea, to 60-second fresh brewed tea, to fresh fruit teas and ice crushes, you can get a bevy of toppings: hand-made cheese, boba, grass jelly, coconut jelly, pudding, red bean, and aloe.  Small super-clean (brand new) shop with seating for only about a dozen."}
{"text":"Cannot believe Nohohon closed down :( I guess it wasn't that popular. I tried the pearl milk tea with less sugar and ice as always at Qualitea it was okay tho still a bit more sugary than normal and feels more water downed. The tapioca varies some are perfect but some are very hard to chew lol"}
{"text":"I got the roasted oolong milk tea and it was delicious. The tapiocas have a slight chew to it and it was just perfect. Would recommend this little place"}
{"text":"I wish I had the guts to try one of the drinks with cheese, or that they did a better job of explaining what it was and how it complimented the drink when we ordered. Either way it sounds cool. I ordered my fav the rose tea and it was delightful. The boba (pearls) were fresh and the barista gave me a generous amount. The shop was really cute and small. It did have a nice place to sit so we just relaxed while our drinks were made. Can't wait to come back and finally try a drink with cheese!"}
{"text":"Because this is the only bubble tea place near by so i decided to drop in, it's not the Japanese green tea bubble tea store anymore unfortunately. Same layout, but they took out some decorations it cheapens a little bit. Just feels like a regular bubble tea place. I ordered a rose milk tea, it was okay, tapioca was not fresh. If i have a choice I won't come here ever again."}
{"text":"According to the Yelp review, I ordered a Roasted Oolong Milk Tea as well just to see the tea preparation process to see how authentic it is, and I am immensely impressed by their live-brew machine that allows all their drinks to be genuinely made.   Now, I'm very intrigued by their Match drinks because I saw the tea-leaf powder in their material stock shelf and discovered that the Matcha colour is the authentic tea-leaf green and not the commercialized Japanese Matcha green. I inquired about it, and the barista told me their source, which I can say it's a quite true to its quality.   My third drink, in the near future would be....the \"Hand-made Cheese\" add-on. never heard of such thing, and is definitely willing to test and try it!  HEAVILY RECOMMENDED FOR people who are looking for a true tea shop instead of just the sugary BBT taste."}
{"text":"This used to be NoHoHon but they moved more west along Queen St and now there is this place!   First time coming to this place but probably alot more time coming to the unit for the bubble tea they used to have when it was Nohohon. I had gotten the specialty fruit drink which was a mixture of multiple fruits together (mango, strawberry, pear and something else). Don't quite remember it all but it was really refreshing.   Initial sips were really good (probably because I was tired and hot from all the walking to the Roger's Centre). Very flavorful fruity drink for the summer and you can taste all the fruit that they put in the drink. I got less sugar since I don't really drinks with too much sugar. I still thought it was a bit sweet but it was alright.   Next time need to try different drinks they have on their menu."}
{"text":"I popped in on a super cold day, wanting to grab something to warm me up. I was pleasantly surprised how tasty my gyukoro green tea was!! I was expecting it to taste like any other green tea from a bubble tea place but this was aromatic, slightly sweet, and refreshing. Next time I will order it with the cheese."}
{"text":"It wasn't too busy when I came on a weeknight. Me and my sister got the peach oolong and roasted milk tea with Oreo and cheese. Barista was polite but there was only her at both cash and making drinks, so it took a lil longer than most bbt. Not unacceptably slow though. The peach oolong was a huge miss for me, you taste no peach and all oolong. The oolong part isn't bad, tea was strong but not bitter, but I really wanted the fruity notes as a nice summer drink. The cheese Oreo one was a very pleasant surprise. I was at first very confused by the idea of cheese in my drink...like mozzarella? Cheddar? Mascarpone? So it actually tastes like LIQUID CHEESE CAKE. The drink was very smooth, rich cheesy taste. I tasted faint savoury notes but nothing repulsive. There was too little Oreo in ours, the bits added really nice texture to the drink, just wish there was more of it so you get some in every sip. My sister said when she had it the first time, there was a lot more...so could be just bad luck. Overall, I would love to try again. I find their prices acceptable but on a slightly higher end for the size."}
{"text":"Love the cups and the little heart shaped cup stopper. My fruit tea is so awesome! Just the right amount of sugar and mix of fresh fruity flavour. The only other place I've tried fruit tea is destiny fusion tea at steeles and midland. I must say qualitea tastes better!   There's not many seating but the time that we dropped by on a weekend, it's empty so we were able to sit down and really enjoy our time!"}
{"text":"I tried the passion fruit green tea with tapioca and the strawberry cheese tea. The passion fruit green tea was very fresh and had a surprising amount of real passion fruit seeds in the drink, way better than the chatime one and a lot less sweet as well even though I always get less sugar. The tapioca was also cooked perfectly. The strawberry cheese drink was very weird to me. I think it's a more acquired taste as I can see how someone could like it but I personally didn't. Again for the strawberry tea it was also very fresh and had real strawberry seeds,"}
{"text":"Saw the sign for 50% off grand opening sale and decided to turn back to give it a try. We weren't sure what \"cheese\" bubble tea was but would explain it as more of a cheesecake foam they put on top of the drink.   We ordered the Peach oolong tea with cheese and the Gyryuro green tea with cheese by the recommendation of the owner. The key is to drink it at a 45 degree angle without a straw first to taste the cream cheese and then drink it together with the tea. The cheese part is really nice and creamy and different from anything I've had before with bubble teas.  We added coconut jelly to both drinks and there was a substantial amount of jellies to our delight.   Only the fresh brewed teas are 50% off for their grand opening (not sure for how much longer). Would be interested to try their signature fresh fruit teas with cheese in the future!"}
{"text":"Although the customer service isn't great, the bubble tea has FLAVOR. Was delicious, qualitea, bubble tea."}
{"text":"Was craving for a fruity drink when we spotted this place from across the street and I'm so glad we did! I got the lychee lemonade green tea (half sweet) and it was delicious! Definitely coming back to try the other flavors but may do 25% sweetness next time. The bf got the traditional milk tea with tapioca pearls which he enjoyed. Said it was \"quality\" haha"}
{"text":"This is such a sarcastic name... because you won't find any Quality what's so ever.  We happened to visit on their grand opening day after finish eating from Sushi restaurant next door.   I ordered classic milk tea quoter sugar with tapioca and my boyfriend ordered Fresh Green tea with Cheese.... I believe it was part of grand opening deal otherwise he wouldn't order such Tea with cheese beverage lol   My Milk tea was overly sweet although I asked for quoter sugar and tapioca was disgusting. It was saggy and not chewy at all.   And Fresh green tea with \"handmade\" cheese... those cheese cream smelled funny and tasted unique. It was tangy and stays on tongue. It didn't go well with tea and also our stomach.  I am not able to identify if our unpleasant washroom experience is coming from those \"Handmade cheese\" or sushi from next door. Needless to say, We couldn't finish both drinks.   NOT RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"I have developed a liking for bbt , sushi, ramen and Qualitiea was on my list.  Sadly their teas have cheese in them. So I got my tea without cheese in it. I got a Passion Fruit Green Tea without cheese and While fruity it felt natural and I was happy. . If you are in the area stop by there and try a  fresh  fruit tea, and if you like cheese then go with it. Their service is efficient. I dont expect much aside from quick service  with 0 attitude.   I plan to  try more fresh teas but not with cheese in them"}
