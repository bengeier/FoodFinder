{"text":"Terrible place. No more. Why we want pay $10+ for those cheap fruits? Taste just soso."}
{"text":"Finally,  i have a chance go to this place cafe de paris. There are popular bonbon series in this place I ordered the mango bonbon. The mango taste very fresh and sweet is not like the bubble tea mango taste sour. The mango slush mix whipped cream together taste amazing I have never tried. The customer service quite good just waiting for 3 minutes for bonbon have been done. The price is definitely worthy the can two person can be share. I will bring to my  gf next time to order another bonbon."}
{"text":"Their signature Bon Bon series is essentially a lot of whip cream, fruits and puree-like. All that for $15... Disappointed. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Super sweet, real mango, real deal for a mango slush, great portion, totally worth it"}
{"text":"I pass by this plaza often and saw cafe de Paris opened its doors a few days ago. I had tried it before in china, and similarly the bonbon is priced pretty high but it is a very large serving size of fresh fruit. Instead I opted for the fresh grapefruit juice which was very refreshing. My only complaint would be that it is a little pricey, but that is typical for freshly squeezed juice I have found. The decor is decent, but as explained by one of  the owners they haven't finished so I'm hoping to see an improvement. Next time I return I'm going to try the white chocolate blueberry cheesecake Can't wait until they are completely ready!"}
{"text":"I tried the Strawberry and Mango BonBon's from the BonBon series. Don't get me wrong they were both delicious.. layers of slush, cream, real fruit... But what made this a 3 star review is  a) the slow service And b) the prices. Around $14 per BonBon?! I don't think so. Make the prices cheaper and maybe I'd consider coming back."}
{"text":"Very fresh and ripe fruit. The workers taste the fruit and throw it out if unripe or spoiled.  Definitely a great place to go.  Keep in mind this is a dessert place!!  I tried the Mango Bon Bon series and it is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"We ordered the strawberry and mango bonbon series and i have to say I'm quite dissapointed. The drinks are not worth the price of $13."}
{"text":"I ordered the Mango Bon Bon and was disappointed. The drink is definitely not worth the $15. I could've made this drink myself - mango juice, whip cream and mango fruit all for less than $5."}
{"text":"Hailing from Asia, Cafe de Paris had a soft opening in Toronto this past weekend. Cafe de Paris is known for their French-themed decor and giant fruit bon bons. At the whopping price of $12.99, you can get a glorious cup (it's the size of a bubbletea cup for reference) of whipped cream, smoothie and fruit. Similar to their Asia counterparts, these prices are pretty ridiculous, however, their coffee prices are pretty reasonable. I got a dutch coffee for $2 which is a pretty good price, however, when I got the coffee, the cup was more than half empty (I thought dutch coffee was cold brew drip coffee but I guess it's more like an espresso...?).  The staff was accommodating though and topped it off with steamed milk upon request.  Similar to their Korean locations, there are also juices on the menu - the grapefruit juice comes with half a grapefruit on top! Though I was pretty excited to try Cafe de Paris because it's still in it's soft opening phase, it was a very mediocre experience."}
{"text":"Overall - 1.0/5.0  Unfortunately this is another overhyped dessert joint. I came here to grab a 'quick' cup of latte which took them 15 minutes to make because they had no sense of how to manage their order queue other than focusing on pumping out their overpriced bon bons. Not a legitimate latte by any means. The micro foam was way too thick and it appeared that they had the espresso in the pitcher as well while the milk was frothing as it came out brown when they poured it into the cup (note: I ordered a regular and not the dutch version). I did get my caffeine fix however to stay awake for a late night escape room session.  I also got a chance to take a look at how they made the bon bons. Basically if you have a blender to make slush and are capable of stacking fruits with layers of whip cream then you can save yourself $13."}
{"text":"We finally get a chance to try it out. As most people said, is nothing special and over price for a cup . Oh sorry, half cup of fruit.   The funniest part is the we order a coffee and a strawberry cup, the chaser asked: you want a hot or ice? I'm like what? Hot or Ice?  And they keeps communicates with Chinese ...   Anyway, for me once is enough and probably won't come back anymore"}
{"text":"Holy cow the prices.. almost $20 with tax for those fruit cups with the smoothie. It's good for the first couple of bites until everything gets mushed together. Happy I got to try it but won't bother coming back,l."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously pretty. It's so clean and asthetic. Majority of people who came was just taking photos, that's how nice it is.  Unfortunately the things they sell isn't amazing. Their special bon bons are plain. They taste good, but I wouldn't get it again. The small was about 7$ while the large was about 11$. I got the cherry and mango. The mango definitely looked prettier and looked like it took more work to make. The fruit we're fresh atleast but if you're a sweet tooth, this is probably not the best place for you. The stuff isn't really sweet, which is great if you like your sweets more mild.    Also the owner/worker was a hardcore smoker and smoked right outside the door. So Everytime the door opened and closed the wind would carry it inside. It smelled gross especially since we were seated in the front."}
{"text":"Inconsistent fruit quality. For mango/strawberry Bon Bon there's a large chance that you would get the sour ones. The fruit pur√©e also doesn't worth the $$ you paid. The cream was falling apart and melting as I was trying to finish the BonBon. It ended up pretty messy.  Overall I would never go back."}
{"text":"Very appealing to the eye however extremely overpriced for what you are getting. Got the strawberry bonbon which is approx 12.99 plus tax? It is literally a cup of strawberries and cream - yes it looks good & tastes exactly what the two ingredients are. If you want an iG photo yes this would be a nice shot - otherwise you can find a much more economical way of eating strawberries and cream!"}
{"text":"Tried the Raspberry bonbon and thought it was nothing special, not worth $15~ It's essentially a raspberry parfait with cream and raspberry slush. The raspberry slush is sweet and was surrounded with the raspberry and cream. The raspberry was tart, probably because they're not in season. However the cream balances it out with it's slight sweetness.   Overall it is ok... but for fruits and some cream for almost $15, I don't think it's worth the price tag"}
{"text":"basically paying overpriced $13 for some fruits + cream + slush  when I went they only has strawberries... the strawberries was sour and not sweet, there was too little cream, and a lot of slush at the bottom.  the line was long and moved very very slow."}
{"text":"I saw so many photos on Instagram of this place, so I wanted to check it out. The fruit bonbons looked amazing, and are definitely insta worthy. The price of them on the other hand, is overpriced. My boyfriend and I got the Mango and Strawberry Bonbon. The mango was a bit sour, and wasn't as good as the strawberry one, which we both liked!  Even though the strawberry bonbon was delicious, it's literally just strawberries, whipped cream, and strawberry slush for around $15. We paid around $30 for both, not really worth it.   It's nice for Instagram, sure, but I can't justify coming here again unless I'm having PMS. LOL"}
{"text":"The desserts were so delicious and servers are so nice. A must go place for desserts in summer. Love their unreal mango so much."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend a couple of weeks ago to see what the hype was about... We walked in and saw that a cup of fruit and whipped cream was 12.99....  Like come on, Im sure it was probably great from Korea, where they originated but really? The cup isn't even made out of glass or Gucci for that matter(lol joking) For a newly opened business I would have tried to set the prices at a more affordable price range and see how the business goes from there..(if it gets a high volume of customers, then I'd slowly raise the price). They would be a busier place if prices dropped by half or a few dollars off.   We didn't end up ordering anything and just left the store; we were even considering a juice but even the grapefruit juice was 8$ so we scrapped it and went to double Ming."}
{"text":"The owner was a sweetheart and the employees were so nice as well! They came up to us and chatted a bit and our pieces of mangoes fell and they gave us more mangoes!!! The dessert was so refreshing and delicious, I would recommend you try it out :)"}
{"text":"This popular chain has been popping up in the city, and I've been wanting to try it since seeing it up at Yonge and Finch. They have a variety of drinks and desserts. This location specifically has only 4 seats. For me the cost of the Bon Bons doesn't justify what it is: strawberry slush, whipped cream layered between strawberry slices. The price for this sweet treat left a very sour taste in my mouth. Other drinks are between $3-6. They've also got cake slices and pastries. Located on the same strip of hip food stores - Rolltation, Fugo and nearby Chatime and Uncle Tetsu Maid Cafe."}
{"text":"Tried the strawberry bon bon as well as the raspberry bon bon at Cafe de Paris. Enjoyed both, probably because I love whip cream, which there was a lot of. They are large enough to share between two, maybe even three people, which would help mitigate the price, around $13."}
{"text":"The mango was sold out, we had two strawberry for 29 something. The taste was ok. Price a little expansive. Cash only. Waited for 15mins for two drinks."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday evening with Jen and my mom! Located at the Brimley and Finch plaza Cafe De Paris is a cute little place that's serving up some nice hot and cold drinks, unsure about food. However the interior is fresh, clean and contemporary with some hints of French decor here and there. Their menu is not extensive, but may want to add some more hot drink option. For drinks I decided to try their cold Chococinno which is a chocolate infused cappuccino topped off with whipped cream  and chocolate flakes on top. To be honest, this drink lacked substance and thickness.  Jennifer had their 'seasonal' OVERPRICED cherry bonbon which in lay-men's term was toppled layers of fruits and slush for $15?  Funny thing, the two drinks I order for my mom and I only came up to $8 (cold and hot chococinno).  Though the ambiance is great, the quality was lacking. Hopefully they'll improve."}
{"text":"The coffee delicious, the fruit fresh, the whip cream and sorbet clearly made in house. A holiday celebration at a family's house? NO WAY! This is the start of a beautiful relationship, my family is likely to have with this Korean chain's first Canadian franchise.  The decor is so pretty and modern. Many tables were around but my cousin and I decided to occupy the comfy blue couches at the front. The interest stemmed from the advertised Dutch coffee. My cousin (being from Holland) was very curious about this menu item which sparked our interest.  The menu is fairly simple but their quality is top notch. My cousin ordered, what else, their Dutch coffee. Topped with whip cream. She enjoyed it immensely. And was informed by the franchise owner that Dutch anything in this company represents how the coffee is made. The contraption was new to both of us. Price: a reasonable $2.  I was not so simple. When in Rome...or I guess in this case Paris! I went for the Strawberry Bonbon. Fresh, juicy fruit layered on top of sorbet complimented by a layer of homemade whip cream. Sprinkle some powdered sugar on top and you got Art in a cup. This is 'slightly' more expensive than your Dutch coffee coming in at $14. However, look at any one of those elements when sold separately (well except the powdered sugar) and the fact that they likely have to import the fresh fruit in winter months and it's hard to dispute that the price is too high. Otherwise, they would be compromising the quality.  They're new and fresh and worth a try. Location number 2 coming soon!"}
{"text":"It was... meh. Was expecting a lot more, both in terms of the variety of offerings (thought it might be a bit more like Bake Code) as well as the taste itself (while the double frontage cheesecake is pretty good, their signature bonbon was a disappointment). Also, the prices weren't that cheap. Overall there are similar places that are much better."}
{"text":"I ordered the photogenic strawberry  Bon Bon.  with all my honesty, the price does not justify the product. too much whip screen In a Tall cup I was disgusted by the chunk of  whipping cream the staff put on I could be biased cuz I am not a fan of whip cream  I ended up cherry picking the strawberries and for the rest, shame on me, but I I had to feed the trash can"}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try out this new cafe! The decor was really nice and the staff were all very friendly. Both my boyfriend and I tried their BonBon series (strawberry and mango) and the fruits were very fresh and the amount of whipped cream inside the cups was just right. The staff was very courteous and they bought our orders right to our tables. I didn't get a chance to try everything on their menu but, I will definitely go back and try the rest of their selections."}
{"text":"Long lineups. Lots of staff drawing on mirrors instead of helping customers. Small space and no understanding of how an assembly line works. Yes the drinks are impressive but underwhelming. Would not come back here."}
{"text":"Originated from South Korea, Cafe De Paris brings to the world of fresh organic sorbet beverages, coffee and cakes.   The moment I stepped inside the store, I was greeted with a beautiful veil of flowers that's perfect for customers to take photos under.   I have never been a big fan of sweets but Cafe De Paris surprised me with their speciality fruit cup sorbet  With summer coming right up, I highly recommend you guys to go try the newly open store on Dundas st and make sure you share with a partner. Also, don't let the price scare you off. The portion they gave you is HUMONGOUS and you are loaded up with fruits to keep you energized and hydrated throughout the day. I rarely find a place (let alone dessert place) I would go back and would take my friends to but I'm definitely going to introduce everyone to Cafe De Paris."}
{"text":"This was a disappointing experience. I wouldn't order anything from the bonbon series if I ever decided to revisit this caf√©.   The entrance had a very strong odor which smells like you were walking through the sewage. After reading previous reviews from yelp, I realized the smell actually came from the owner's smoking habits.    This place was pretty spacious and had lots of available tables. They had comfortable sofas and mini games (ex. cards) accessible on the tables. They don't have a lot of choices but it was better than nothing. This made me wonder if you were allowed to bring your own games to play.   We decided to give their mango bonbon a try. When we received our order, we were snapping away with some gorgeous pictures with this product!   However, the overall experience of this product was a joke. I just paid $14 worth of hand cut mangoes and whipped cream!!!! I could get a box of mangoes with that money. I wished they replaced the whipped cream with ice cream or something to elevate this dessert.   Other than the RIDICULOUS price for something you can make at home there were still some good points. I liked how the mangoes were actually were very sweet and fresh. Also, the bottom layer of the cup had a mango slush which tasted very delicious.   The bonbon series really need some MAJOR readjustments; I can see a lot of disappointing reviews about this product.   Will I come back? Maybe? I'm curious about their drink menu. I might consider trying their mango slush."}
{"text":"Background info:  Cafe De Paris is a Korean franchise that is based from a popular cafe in Garosu-Gil, Gangnam (Seoul). Our Toronto location is now going through its soft opening phase and has been recently opened to the public.   The interior of the cafe is clean, minimalist yet elegant with its white and blue theme inspired by the colours of Paris. If you are a cafe lover of sweets and desserts then this is the place for you. The detailed decor also sets you into a very calming mood as the open space feels very welcoming.  They even have a grand mural painting hand painted onto the wall by Evelyn; that is supposed to replicate the well-known Pont des Arts bridge in Paris, a heritage site along the Seine River.  Incase you haven't heard of it already, it is a traditional place where couples would attach padlocks with sentimental messages onto the bridge to symbolize their love for one another.  Although the tradition has been banned due to the tremendous weight from the heavy locks that have been placed on the bridges back in Paris, I have been told by one of the owners from Cafe de Paris that they plan to encourage their customers to attach love locks to their very own version of the Pont des Arts bridge. How you may ask? A fence is cleverly placed infront of the painted mural and is there for lovers to attach their locks onto.  Taste:   I loved my strawberry Bon Bon! I have never had such fresh tasting sweet juicy strawberries in my dessert before. As you can see, a generous amount of at least 7-8 strawberries were placed into the cup. The dessert itself was not dunked into sugar either it was just porportionally sweetened with the mixture of light whipped cream. #strawberrylicious"}
{"text":"Like most other reviewers have said. This place for their featured Bon Bon drinks are definitely overpriced $12.99. I got the strawberry Bon Bon...Bottom is strawberry slush (made with syrup and ice), fresh strawberries and whip cream.   Would I come back again? Maybe not."}
{"text":"I tried the strawberry yesterday. It is bit price of only one fruit in my opinion. The cream and slush is good."}
{"text":"Overall aside from being Instagram worthy, I guess I would try it just once. Price is a bit steep at $12 for a bon bon, the drink they are known for. Think of it as a Raspberry slush with whip cream. Also had a latte, which was pretty good. The store interior is pretty basic, although the wall art is quite nice but not enough to really support the \"cafe de paris\" vibe that I think they were trying to go for... Best of luck."}
{"text":"I have seen this cafe in Korea before and well... their signature bon bon drink is close $20 there. Ridiculous.   Anyhow, the bon bon sell for $13 here and imo it's still overpriced. I can easily grab a box of fruit for less than $10 at T&T, perhaps even at Loblaws lol. How are you going to justify paying a drink consist of slush/whip cream/fruit for $13? It's not the worst thing I have had before, I just don't think it's worth it. Consider that this place is located in a super cheap plaza, I'm not sure if this cafe will do well.   I also had their hot chocolate. Diabetes alert. No thx.   Also, I know some people comment how simple this cafe look, I honestly think this place looks borderline old and out of place in this plaza. I like the mural at the back and the concept of love locks that you can put there. But just like the bridge in Paris, once there are too many locks, the damn fence will collapse people..."}
{"text":"Too costly for a drink filled with strawberries and whipped cream  More variety is needed   Seating is cute"}
{"text":"It's not bad... But it's also not worth the price you pay. For the Bon Bon series, it'll come up to around 13-14$.  I got the raspberry one and in terms of taste, I would give it 3 stars - mainly for the slush at the bottom which is pretty decent but limited. The rest is fruit and whipped cream. They do make it look pretty.. Which also means they take a little more time.  The interior decor and ambience is pretty nice though. It's very clean and suitable for pictures.   Got it once. Probably not twice though."}
{"text":"After seeing all the nice Instagram photos. I've decided to try out this place. The desserts are instagram worthy but it seems very overpriced for a cup of fruits with fruit slush and whipped cream. It's pretty much $15 after taxes for one. Totally not worth it. You're better off buying your own fruits and making it yourself.   This place is only good as a one time thing. One cup of Bon Bon is more than enough for two people."}
{"text":"The mango Bon Bon Series was pretty tasty! Very fresh mango chunks and they were very big! Mango mixed with whipped cream is the bomb dot com. However a little pricey tho!$$$ $14.73 was a little too expensive Bc u can literally buy a whole case of mangoes hahaha"}
{"text":"The ratio of fruits and whipping cream is great, the raspberry bonbon is so refreshing, cant wait to try other fruit bonbon!"}
{"text":"Coming in I seriously expected more from this place... There wasn't much on the menu but I guess they're known for the mango Bon Bon. The mango Bon Bon has mango slush at the bottom, whip cream in the middle, and topped with slices/chunks of mango. I ordered the mango Bon Bon and the iced caramel mochiato. The mango Bon Bon tasted decent but it wasn't worth paying $13 dollars for. The iced caramel mochiato honestly tasted like an iced coffee I would get at mc Donald's so I was pretty disappointed.  The customer service was really whatever at that point and the seats are very limited inside and not super comfortable either.  My overall experience wasn't the best."}
{"text":"Saw many pictures and reviews. Many people mentioning how it looks better than it tastes. Gave it a try cuz i couldnt resist how pretty it looks in pictures lol  It is very over priced ($12.99) for a cup of fruit and whipped cream. Cant reli say its a drink cuz not even a third of the cup is the slush. The fruits were sweeter than i thot tho! Didnt expect that, consider theyre not in season right now."}
{"text":"An interesting concept of strawberry froze, whip cream, and strawberries. If you're into sweets and something instagramable, try this place out!"}
{"text":"Saw a lot of Instagram posts of desserts at this place so I decided to give it a try. Tried the Mango Bonbon series. Can't believe this mango slush drink was $14. The mango pieces were not frozen but fresh fruit and ripe so it was sweet so I'll give it that, but way overpriced. The slush under the stack of mango chunks and whip cream was okay, nothing special. They have this place in Korea which got my attention but I doubt it would be this expensive.  It's a gimmick for Instagram pictures, I won't be coming back. Oh, and service was SO SLOW. Probably waited 20 mins for this.  Side note not sure if it was just that day, but the place smelled really bad. I think their washroom was broken or something but the smell kept coming out....completely ruined my experience too."}
{"text":"fresh fruit. And the entire store are just impressive  Personally recommend the mango. Also try the organic low fat yogurt ice cream"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night with 4 of my friends and expected it to be busy, which it was. It had been really hyped up by some of my friends, so I went in with high expectations. Unfortunately, this cafe did not live up to them.  Management: we walked in and had no idea where the line was and there was no one to direct us either. After asking a few people, we figured it out and then started to wait for our turn. After we ordered, we didn't know where to wait as no prompts were given.   Service: when we got there, the cashier didn't speak English very well so we had to point to the picture and use gestures before she got our order. We also asked for lids for our dessert but she gave me everything but that 3 times before I finally pointed at it directly.  Cleanliness: the tables were all full and the seats were all taken by people who didn't even order anything so we couldn't sit down. The tables that were empty were all dirty so we didn't want to sit there. The washroom also had toilet paper on the floor and water everywhere so it was really slippery.  Our group only got the following item:  1. Raspberry bonbon ($13.99): there were raspberries with (what looks like) house-made whip cream and some raspberry slush at the bottom. It was way too sweet - the raspberries, cream, and the slush. Didn't enjoy eating it either as it melted pretty quickly and became a slushy mixture that didn't look appetizing anymore. The price tag is way too high for what you get. When I showed a picture and asked my friends who didn't go, how much they thought it was, I got between $7-$9 at most.   Overall, the wait for an overpriced and overly sweet dessert is not worth it. The management was mediocre and the cleanliness and service were way below average. I'm giving it 2 stars because of the novelty but I wouldn't be surprised if it dies down in the future."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place!  It was really cute inside, everything looked clean and dainty.  I was a little shocked at how much they charged for these bonbons but the presentation was very nicely done.  You need to be careful walking with it as the fruits were only stacked together by whipped cream.  I've seen some customers losing a few pieces to the floor because it is just so delicate.  I got the mango bonbon and it was good and it's perfect to share amongst 3 people too.  It is overpriced for what it is but it's nice to try once.  I had sweet too pieces but sour middle. Had to mix it with the slush to equalize it."}
{"text":"Mmmm rating 3/5 only because of the steep price of the dessert. This is a cute little shop located in the heart of Toronto and it's walking distance from Eatons. There are seats that can fit a total of 4 people inside and there's a huge backdrop of their name \"cafe de Paris\" on one of the walls with flowers around it. The dessert comes in two sizes but the bigger size makes it more insta worthy ;). The dessert as a whole wasn't too sweet so that's a good thing (for me at least- not a big fan of super sweet things). It can get a bit messy to eat if the fruits fall off since they're kinda stacked. Overall, it tastes good but overpriced for a cup of shaved ice and fruits. Not bad if you share stuff with a few people though."}
{"text":"The quality of drinks served here don't live up to the price tag that's being charged. Their signature Bon Bon drink series consists of slush, whip cream and fruits stacked up in a plastic takeout cup for a whopping $13. The service was also lackluster, slow and disorganized, but with the right training and process optimization, we may see some improvement.  Where the place does earn some points is the interior decor which is quite Instagram-worthy; white minimalistic walls, and a beautiful mural of the Pont Des Art bridge in Paris overlooking the Seine river.   Other than that, you may get more bang for the buck if you take your $13 elsewhere."}
{"text":"Only can comment on the takeout. Got one of their special desserts with strawberry. The staff was nice and helpful when deciding on Menu. However $15 for a dessert that was mostly ice and whippwd cream was a bit upsetting. The person making my dessert was attentive to detail of the strawberries and I dunno what was in the slush part. The dessert looked amazing, like an art piece. It was so a large cup size, so portion inst bad. I cannot comment much on the taste because I only had 1 bite, as the dessert was for my sister. Only giving it 4 star because $15 for a dessert is really pricey especially something like this."}
