{"text":"Worst Indian food I have eaten in my entire life. The goat curry had 5 peices floating in a pool of half cooked chopped onions."}
{"text":"My husband and I were killing some time in the Jukebox Plaza and decided to try some food. I had the butter chicken and it was amazing. Hubby had the chicken tikka masala and said it was pretty good. Overall a 4/5. They will def be my go to for quick Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"So we drove a total of 1 1/2 hrs to Tiffin Restaurant and back today to pick up: Beef and Chicken Biryani, Channa Bhatura, naan, Mutton Karahi, Butter Chicken, Beef Samosas and a variety of sweets.  We had this food on Friday and just couldn't wait to revisit Tiffin today Sunday to get some more delicious food.  Highly recommended."}
