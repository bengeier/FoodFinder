{"text":"Cod and potato fritters are excellent...plantain is delicious. Had the squash and corn soup...great for a cold and miserable night."}
{"text":"We stopped in this place while we were walking down St Clair on a Sunday afternoon. The decor is really lovely and the music is a good volume. Not too loud to talk over. We had the prix fixe special. It came with an appetizer (soup), entrée and dessert. The starter was a hearty beef soup, almost a stew. The entrée was salmon with vegetables, and the dessert was organic Haitian chocolate mousse. It was all very delicious, I would definitely come with some friends."}
{"text":"I was at La Creole for Winterlicious and the food here is great. I ordered off the winterlicious menu - soup du jour, flank steak and plantain straw fries and the gato for dessert. My friend ordered off the regular menu and had le capitaine codfish and a side of shrimp creole. The soup was delicious and the steak was tender and well seasoned. I stole a few of my friend's yummy shrimp creole and the codfish was crunchy on the outside and perfectly cooked inside.

Being new to Haitian food, I had to try everything and the spicy pikliz did not disappoint. I didn't notice anything about the forks, so no complaints there. It'd be a perfect score except the butter cake (le gato la creole) I had for dessert was a little dry and had me wishing for a fruit coulis to pour on it. 

Overall, an excellent meal with lovely friendly staff and nice music. I'll certainly be back for a live music night."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Really enjoyed the food. The plantain was really good and everything was cooked exceptionally. We particularly enjoyed the green plantain burger, the mango coleslaw, the malt drink and the fried chicken. Also the fish was tremendous and the serving sizes was really nice. We enjoyed the ambiance, our waitress was very friendly, and the food came within a reasonable time period.  

Would visit again. 

Great Pricing:
Spent $55.00 for two
The other couple we went with spent $65 for two"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and dessert!!! Excellent ambiance. Recommend the beef ratatouille and the pea fritters."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere...casual but jazzed up with chandeliers and gauzy ceiling draping. Although the music was a little eclectic...ranging from bachata and Spanish pop to French pop...but always fairly mellow.  Haitian Creole cuisine is definitely a niche for Toronto.

The prices are very reasonable.

Appetizers were scrumptious...especially the lamb chops.  The piclicz (sp?) cabbage slaw pickled with scotch bonnets for the beignets was great too.

We ordered the whole snapper, creole chicken and ratatouille for the 3 of us.  The entrees were more simple...very hearty and felt more like creole home cooking, with rice and beans.  Filling!  Service was attentive and very smiley.

Overall, definitely recommend this place.  Something different than typical GTA fare."}
{"text":"Not only is the food absolutely delicious but the location is also really pretty. Love the ambiance! I enjoyed the juicy turkey and my friend ordered chicken, which was perfectly tender and so tasty. The cocktails are super yummy (I had the Zouk) and the server was really helpful. I felt like I escaped Toronto's cold for a few hours and sailed off to the Caribbean. Can't wait to go back, I heard the fish is a must!"}
{"text":"My family and I dined here tonight and we were really impressed.

The service was friendly and attentive but not obtrusive. Our server had excellent suggestions and was very accommodating and warm to our toddler. Another family with a toddler came in and we could tell that this wasn't their first time as the staff also greeted them warmly.

The setting is quite pretty. We sat in a booth in an open window and the cool breeze made us feel as though we were on vacation. The decor is pleasant and relaxing and the music was really nice without being overpowering. They have a small stage with live music some nights and I think it would be a great place for a celebration.

The food and drinks were really interesting. I had a rum, coconut and pineapple drink that had something else in it that I couldn't quite place that made it into something quite unusual and pleasant. I didn't ask what it was so I'll just have to keep sampling until I can figure it out! My toddler quite enjoyed his lime and vanilla drink which was a nice twist on lemonade.

The beignets were absolutely perfect, and as our server predicted, our little one attained toddler Nirvana. I've never had Haitian Creole prior to this but I will come back on the strength of these toasty treats alone! 

The mains were really delicious. The apricot-grilled lamb chops were perfectly cooked. The Poul La Creole, oven roasted with a creamy, delicately-spiced sauce is the Haitian equivalent of butter chicken. The real standout for me was the ratatouille. The only word that comes close to describing the depth of flavours is 'warm'. We think that they must roast the vegetables before pureeing. No need to add meat.

My only complaint was a small one. The Akkra de Morue (cod & potato croquettes) could have used a bit more seasoning, and while the outsides were golden, the insides were a bit gooey. A little onion and an extra minute in the fryer and they would have been perfect. I did however really enjoy the slaw that came on the side, which had just a touch of scotch bonnet, but the avocado watercress spread didn't seem like quite the right accompaniment. 

We will definitely be returning, hopefully sans toddler and with cab fare to enjoy some live music and some rum drinks in the window nook."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the cozy atmosphere, I originally came here for the Haitian experience and to interview the owner of the restaurant who was very kind and friendly. it is clean and relatively new which opened a year ago. If you want a taste if the Haitian culture, this is definitely the place to be! You can SMELL the Haitian cuisine, LISTEN to Créole music, SEE the colourful artwork,  designs of the Haitian culture as well as FEEL like you're in a whole new environment and of course, TASTE the delicious Haitian food. the owner is fluent in English, French, Créole and a bit of Spanish. as for the food, it is definitely flavourful, unique and I highly suggest the appetizers :)
Ps, hours are only for dinner time that starts at 5pm. But the owner hopes to gradually expand the hours in the future :)"}
{"text":"Terrific food!

We went here very shortly after it opened - the service was still a little disorganized, but the food was amazing. The appetizer plate was great (particularly the green bananas and croquettes), and the ratatouille and chicken (almost like a cassoulet) we had were delicious.  Also lots of great rum-based drinks.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great experience. Very eclectic menu with plenty of selection. 
Delicious whole fish fried with creole sauce. Nice sampler platter of amuse bouche. 
Affordable meal with good service."}
{"text":"Went with a groupon to try this place. Ambience is nice, place is small and cozy. Service was average. The creole dishes were excellent - I had shrimp with corn grits  (polenta ) and hubby had pulled pork.  My salad app was small and under whelming but his spicy chicken soup was delicious. We made the mistake of getting the pineapple coconut cake instead of beignets. The dessert was a mishmash of pound cake  (tasted store bought ), sprinkled dry coconut,  mango sauce and lime gelato. The flavors didn't go together and honestly brought my rating down from a 4. The meal would have been better without the dessert. I wanted to like this place but doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"We were here during winterlicious 2016.  Arrived on Saturday night at about 6pm.  

Service: We were promptly seated.   We sat at our table for about 10 minutes without being acknowledged by any server.  They came by a table beside ours twice and didn't say anything to us. It looked like they only had one waitress for the entire place, which was a bit odd for a Saturday night. 

Cleanliness: The lap cloth for my girlfriend was crusty and had a stain on it.  We then inspected the glasses on our table and they were dirty too.  At this point we got up and left. 

Really disappointed because we looked forward to trying some of this cuisine."}
{"text":"Do not use the Groupon for this restaurant.  The value is ms-represented."}
{"text":"I had the wonderful opportunity to go to The La Creole Restuarant on Christmas Eve and had a wonderful experience.  

I'm in love with Haitan food now and have already prepared to make Pikliz and Epice and home.

The atmosphere was quite comforting as well the food was addictive.

The staff and other patrons were very friendly.

The music and visuals on the large tv screen were lovely and set your mind in a tropical location.

There was someone who commented on the forks, ... and how they were hard to manage, .... REALLY???   The utensills were quite fine.  

My friend and I were expremly pleased and even ordered food to take home.

I see us returning to La Creole again, as well I have already told a friend about it and she was quite impressed. 

There was even space for those who needed to have a priveate function.

HAPPY NEW YEAR  La Creole!!!

{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant for Valentine's Day. I really feel like it's a hidden gem. It was really cool to try Authentic Haitien food (something we'd never tried before). My husband ordered the fish and didn't think he would finish it as the portion was so big but there was nothing left on his plate by the end of our dinner! The vibe in the restaurant was really nice as well."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant. The staff were so friendly and the food was spectacular. I actually crave the dishes they made."}
{"text":"The place was small and cozy. The cutleries looked good. Serving sizes were pretty good. Started with a cabbage slaw and beignet which was good. Ordered the lamb and my gf ordered the turkey. Both dishes had meats that were not edible. We could not even cut the meat. I had two bites of the lamb and didn't eat the rest. Had to look for food afterwards. The flavours were good, but I couldn't eat the meat. I'm fairly certain I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place was perfect; casually upscale and romantic without being fussy. The food was interesting but approachable and our waiter was excellent. Savory beignets highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Caveat 1:
We did this on a Groupon so our choices were limited. Overall the food was good. The service well....

Friendly. Everyone was friendly but oblivious. Example: seated at a table for 4 the extra settings were never cleared and just left to crowd the table. Between courses empty plates sat on the table for 5 -10 minutes while servers passed repeatedly empty handed. 

The Groupon menu had no descriptions on it. For instance the choice of mains were listed as  \"Lamb or Salmon or Ratatouille.\" etc. No explanation of what the preparation or sides were. When my wife inquired as to what the salmon was like and how was it prepared we were told \"grilled\" .... yep. that's all we got. Once we ordered there was no bread or anything brought to the table. Not compulsory to bring a nosh but we're sitting 10 - 15 minutes waiting. Appetizers were good. When The 2nd course came out. The soup was delicious. The salad my wife ordered was fine. Then 5 minutes later we were brought another set of soup and salad which we declined. The waitress was very confused and flustered. The mains:  I had the lamb which was very good. I'd like to tell you what it was served with I think it was grits.. but again there was nothing on the menu describing the preparation or sides so I'm guessing. My wife had the ratatouille over rice which wasn't mind blowing but was nicely seasoned and tasty.

CUTLERY. I know it's weird and might sound picky but beautiful design, nice to look at, impossible to use. Maybe it was just the fork. But it was so sleek and cylindrical that as a result when I tried to hold something for cutting it kept rolling between my fingers. I have never complained about cutlery before in a restaurant and I know how stupid it sounds but so annoying. It just one of those small details that add up over a night of little things taking away from the meal.

We ordered wine when we arrived. Never during the four courses did anyone ask if we wanted another drink. When dessert was served we were never asked about coffee or tea. We finished dessert and had to flag someone down after ten minutes for the bill. 

In my Groupon experience when a bill is given usually the REAL meal total is on the bill then discounted so the customer can base the tip on what the food's actual value is. This was not on the bill. Very frustrating. I guessed. Also,  the waitress hovered over my shoulder as I was figuring out the tip which just screams inexperience to me. 

The jazz band that was playing was great. The decor is nice, although the exterior for some inexplicable reason still remains uninviting. 

I will stress this: The FOOD WAS GOOD. My lamb was really good. All four courses were tasty but the service was not up to par. I may try this place again but I will give them some time to get up to speed and work the kinks out."}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious 2015 and ordered the plantain soup, short rib with grits, and sorbet with fruit compote. I was disappointed with the food considering the number of good reviews. Perhaps it was because of the Summerlicious menu?

The soup was okay, not spicy, but had a bit of a kick to it. I think I would've enjoyed the fried plantains more but that's just personal preference. The short rib was tender and the meat fell off the bone. It was flavourful; however, I wasn't a fan of the grits and there were large chunks, which I was not sure if it was intentional or not. The dessert was alright. My friend ordered their version of creme brulee but it was not smoothie or creamy at all. Another friend ordered the beignets with chocolate sauce and they were alright.

All in all, the company was great, but the food was mediocre. The atmosphere was small and cozy. The waiter was professional, friendly, and attentive.  Unfortunately, the city has so many different restaurants to try that I don't think it would be worth coming back."}
{"text":"Note: This review is limited to Groupon users for this restaurant. Watch out for the bait and switch!!! Living in the area for the past several years I often walked by this place and finally decided to give it a shot when it popped up on Groupon. Made reservations and went in last night only to find out that the regular menu was not available to Groupon users. Not a single main course from the main menu was an option. We had an option of a tiny cup (served half full) of potato-corn soup or a minuscule basic salad. The salad was a throw away but the soup was tasty - all 3 spoonfuls of it. The mains chosen were a shrimp dish serves on some corn grits and a pulled pork dish served with a tiny dollop of rice and beans and a sliver of plantain. The shrimp was acceptable but could hardly be considered a meal to any grownup. The pulled pork was fatty and, once again, bite sized. Dessert consisted of 2 options. Cake or beignets. The beignets were delicious. By far the best thing on the pared down micro-menu. The cake was awful. Overall, the whole experience was \"cheap\" and insulting. Even at Groupon prices the meal wasn't worth anywhere near the value paid. This place just doesn't seem to understand that a promotion is meant to introduce a restaurant to new customers and it would be wise to offer the best it can. Not here. A crappy experience and I'll probably never be back. Quite sad as I live so close and I would have liked a new local restaurant option."}
{"text":"My family and I have been sitting here for over an hour waiting for our main courses. We came for summerlicious and so far the appetizer has been quite disappointing. The plantain wasn't sweet and was mostly batter. The waiter didn't ask how the steak was to be cooked, brought out warm wine, and when asked for a cooler wine he took so long that we cancelled the order. Then he came out after all the other meals were served and asked to switch the steak order because they hadn't begun cooking it. Not to mention that the spaghetti had canned fish in it. On the plus side the begniette was excellent, nice and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Overall however it was honestly a terrible experience."}
