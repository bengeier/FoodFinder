{"text":"Ordered this for take-out, huge portions, they don't skim on anything, they put sauces in separate container, noodles in one, soup in one, bag of bean spouts. Soup was very hot, this is necessary to cook the bean spouts, only downside is either they have added MSG or the soup was just a msg soup stock they bought it from elsewhere. But the rest is awesome!"}
{"text":"It's good, broth and the rest of the soup fillings are all good. The Taro bubble tea is also worth having. There aren't many places if any for bubble tea in the neighbourhood and I'm glad this is here for the bubble tea alone. I almost can't wait for the cold weather to go back for a warm bowl."}
{"text":"While my meal was tasty (I had only two bites of it) and their fragrant fresh basil was a nice touch, my husband's meal was a con job. Despite the menu saying the dish contained Vietnam wonton, tiger shrimp, and some other good sounding things, the pho arrived with absolutely no shrimp. The egg noodles were also stuck together in a big inseparable ball that took a long time to pull apart unsuccessfully. When we asked where the shrimp was, we got  different answers from the shrimp is ground up in the wonton, to there is only one shrimp...it's not plural....the cook is new, he forgot to add that shrimp. We suspect they probably just ran out of shrimp and didn't tell us? We felt deceived and had to leave without eating our meal."}
{"text":"After two disappointing openings at Yonge Eglinton, the Star Pho King and the Truly Thai, a promising new place has opened. The Pho King Fabulous. Has the real deal finally come to us? After my fourth visit, I am still a believer. I have ordered the pork vermicelli with spring roll. Mango milk smoothie. Liquor licence, I was told, is coming. I thanked my lucky star, the marinated pork has a nice barbecued taste. So many times, this very pork, in other Vietnamese restaurants, is not acceptable. The accompaniments, iceberg lettuce, pieces of cucumber, carrots, fresh bean sprouts, even my beloved mint leaves. Roasted peanuts. The dip, so vital for this dish, is served in a small porcelain dish. A relief after the smudged plastic bottle now on your table at Pho Hung. The dip does not reach the depth of the one from now closed Saigon Star, but I am still grateful. And the star, for me, is the spring roll. Very fresh on this day, Tuesday. The wrapping is slender, delicate. The filling delicious. The mango milk shake is nudging over these few visits toward an actual mango taste. Great!
I visited the washroom, very clean, no off putting smell of deodorant, nicely decorated. The place as a whole is quite large. Impeccably clean. It is streamlined alongside dark wood colouring. But, mainly, the kitchen is the focus here. A real effort to serve genuine Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Another poor Vietnamese option in the area. The Pho broth tastes like water , Luke warm, ingredients are not enough , sauces are very limited, wait staff are slow and indifferent to the customer and menu. One of those places on the area that won't last very long :-( all the above can easily be addressed , if the owner decides to serve authentic Vietnamese Pho :-)"}
{"text":"This place was awful. The meat in the rare beef pho soup was fatty and the broth was greasy - yuck. Worst pho ever had."}
{"text":"Ordered via Uber eats.  Took a while to get here but was pretty tasty and generous portions!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the P2 and found the broth very bland and noodles overcooked. No bowls for sauces anywhere in sight. OK in a pinch"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and had a fried chicken + pork on rice dinner, pho without the tripe, beef rice rolls.

Overall satisfied. Arrived very fast, good flavour."}
{"text":"Love pho, and this place was great! Service was good. My husband had P2 (rare beef) and I had P7 (minced beef and ginger), we both ordered large size. Both were good, delicious broth, lots of noodles and meats:)"}
{"text":"Live in the neighbourhood so been meaning to try this spot for a few months now. We are big ramen fans so we were excited to try its Vietnamese counterpart. 

Ordered the chicken pho (+ spicy) and the beef pho and both were delicious. 
Broth was light and flavourful and come with a dish that is loaded with fresh bean sprouts and lime wedges. For a first pho experience, it really was pho-king fabulous!

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Round Two! Even better than the first time. Perfect proportion of broth and Noodles. So flavorful and fresh! Definitely will be back, many, many times."}
{"text":"Went twice. Probably won't go again.
\"Real fruit smoothie\" contains one strawberry and a scoop of strawberry powder.
Service not good."}
{"text":"Im so so so so happy to finally have a great pho place in the area~  lesser ones come and go, but pho king is so satisfying~  now a regular weekly place for me, whether eating in or delivered,  its so good.  I've waited so long for this, and pho king did not disappoint!  So happy,  its definitely great comfort food esp in the winter!   The soup is great,  nice fresh rolls,  nice bubble teas,  couldnt ask for more~"}
{"text":"I ordered the rice dish c1. It was sorta a let down cause the price was more expensive then authentic pho places i went too, so i assumed it would taste better or have a bigger portion. But the portion was small, really oily, slightly chewy, bland and i got the ends of the cucumber, tomato and lettuce."}
{"text":"This pho place rips people off of their food, for the price you pay you don't get the value of it. I ordered seafood noodle, with one slice of cucumber, barely any shrimps and a bunch of noodle (which is cheapest value of food) I don't recommend it to anyone around this area, save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm rather new to Vietnamese Pho and this place is the first place I have ever had it. Since it's where I popped my Pho Cherry and my friends brought me to nurse my severe post birthday hangover, it will always have a special place in my heart. I have had better pho since but this is good, so I do go back from time to time.

Right now, I eat Pho about twice a week so had my first experience been terrible, I probably wouldn't have become such a fan.

The broth has a particular taste. I've tasted broths that were extremely salty and others that didn't taste like anything. This one is on the neutral side. I usually get the rare beef with tendons and beef balls. Simple. The restaurant is very clean.

3.5*"}
{"text":"Disappointed with the lack of flavour. I can't believe I just spent $20 on a meal of tasteless noodles.  They must have changed the cook; too bad, I won't be back."}
{"text":"We ordered 1 bubble tea and 1 dish. The order was placed at 6:24 and the food arrived at 8:16. I'm truly speechless. This is the second time I've given them a try. The first time, I went in to sit down and there was 5 people in the whole restaurant including myself and I asked them twice for an extra meat ball in the pho. Meal was done and they didn't even acknowledge it. I wish I could give this place 0 stars for service especially."}
{"text":"Dropped in Saturday afternoon  and had the best veggie cold wraps I ever had.  My husband had the vegetarian soup pho and shared my canteloupe froster.  Will definitely be back.  Welcome to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"The name alone deserves 5 stars. But I gotta say I also love the decor, the portion sizes, and he speed at getting seated at the tail end of the lunchtime rush. My date had the pho and I had the hot and spicy soup. Both were great but definitely pick the pho if you're unsure."}
{"text":"Good pho. Good grilled pork. Tried spicy noodle. Like the broth, but not the noodle. Bigger, fuller spring rolls (although the filling is a bit salty for my taste). No extra large size, so order extra noodle if you have big appetite. Good ambience. Good service. Going to be a regular here."}
{"text":"It's very bold and daring to open up a pho restaurant in a non ethnic neighborhood. Inside is clean and modern and almost reminds me of a modern French bistro. It certainly looked very promising. I ordered the Bun Bo Hue because that's the litmus which determines if I will ever return. The broth was underwhelming, bland and flat. I had to ask for fish sauce to season it better and even then was okay-ish. Considering most of the clientele dining are unfamiliar with Vietnamese cuisine, it doesn't really matter. Too \"pho king\" bad for diners who know what  authentic quality Vietnamese cuisine should be like."}
{"text":"Food- 4
Service-3.5

This place is great. It's got good food for a really good price. The savings aren't as bug as other Viet places in the area but the quality is definitely there. I've ordered pho and various vermicelli and rice dishes and have been very happy. The pho is very flavourful and the meat is good too except for the flank, I found it to be tough and fatty, I usually stick to rare beef and beef balls. The vermicelli dishes are served with a fried spring roll which is good when done right, I've eaten it on off days but thankfully it only happened once, you can also substitute for a fresh roll which I highly recommend getting the grilled chicken fresh roll because its delicious and its served with this mouth water peanut sauce! The service is good but nothing special, they're polite and quick but make sure to double check your order before your waiter leaves as I have had an occasional where they got my substitution wrong but it wasn't a big deal. 

Overall it's my go-to pho spot in the yonge and eg area, great on late nights or really cold days!"}
{"text":"Perhaps it would more accurately be named Pho King Mediocre.

The beef broth was OK, but nothing special.  The chicken broth was bland at best.  The screwed up an order for someone with an allergy, and the service, in general, was unimpressive.

It's OK, but there are much, much better Pho places nearby."}
{"text":"Came here for a 30th birthday celebration , mostly based on the name.  Pho-king amazing right? 
Well right off the bat its uptown so I'm a bit prejudiced. It seems like a lot of places at Yonge and Egg are designed for people with lots of money who don't venture downtown very often. As such the places around here cater to a more well heeled crowd. 

Service was very friendly and quick and the place is nicely laid out and lit. Top marks for that. On to the food. 

I had a Pho Hue (spicy one) and sampled a bit of my friends authentic Pho. I found both a bit bland. The broth was good but not quite on the same level as places like Pho Hung and the Golden Turtle downtown. Again I suspect this might be the cooks tailoring to their mid town clients. 

So in closing. Nice friendly joint with semi bland broth. Perfect if you live in this hood. Not worth the trip otherwise."}
{"text":"A friend convinced me to give this place a chance claiming that he had read good reviews online. I'm writing this review to make sure that such travesties never happen again! 

The pho at this place was completely mediocre. Slip pickings meat wise, the broth was completely average and they only had two sized to choose from which left my wife eating too much and me not having enough. 

The contrast of good pho vs bad pho gets even worse with this place knowing that my top Pho place these days is just a 5 minute walk south of here! Star King! WAY BETTER OPTION!"}
{"text":"Very clean, nicely appointed, reasonable priced beer and good service...but that is where it stops.
The food was tasteless, the crispy fried wontons were limp and the shrimp and wonton Pho had one small shrimp.
This place is not wort the price."}
{"text":"This place has a big struggle with the concept of vegetarian, aka no meat. I ate there once before and that was an okay experience. My friend told me that they now finally have pho on veggie stock. So I decided to give that a try. 
I came in, sit down, place an order - of pho on veggie stock. Ok? Ok.
Ten minutes later, a server comes and says: We do not have veggie stock now. We are going to make it either on chicken or beef, ok?
Me: NO.
The server appeared a little shocked. I took another look at the menu, but did not find anything else there and left.
I do not understand why they had to wait for 10 minutes to inform me about veggie stock fiasco. Were they looking for veggies for that long in the kitchen? :)"}
{"text":"It's a good place to have traditional pho. Service is nice and fairly quick. I usually do take-outs but the one experience of seating down for lunch was pleasant as well."}
{"text":"Food:  Ordered some delicious viet coffee with condense milk.  First time I've had it served with the drip normally how I've had it is premade and brought to the table.  The coffee was good but wasn't as strong as I would have liked it.  Ordered a P1 large which was delicious, the portion was huge.  Only disappointing part was the beef wasn't that great.

Decor:  Well decorated and modern.  The sriracha and hoison sauces came in these little ceramic containers which although was a nice way to present it, lacked enough content volume, we demolished the containers.

I'd return here if I'm in the area and craving pho."}
{"text":"Clean, modern and spacious. However, the food was pretty tasteless and prices are high for what you get."}
{"text":"This is probably the cleanest Vietnamese place I've ever been to, so that's a plus. 

Food: Ordered a large special pho and chicken rice noodle rolls. The pho was good, it tasted light but flavorful without the obvious hints of MSG. I loveddddd the chicken rolls, the dipping sauce was absolutely delicious.

Service: Fast and quick, better than most Vietnamese places!

Atmosphere: Very clean, even their sauces were in nice little bowls.

Their name is funny and prompted us to go and try it, it is pretty fabulous and I recommend it if you're in the area :)"}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a tough critic because I just came from Hanoi, Vietnam nearly 2 months before eating at Pho King Fabulous (hilarious name btw) while doing a Southeast Asia tour for 5 months - and Vietnam takes the cake for the best food I've ingested out of 10 countries I've visited. Naturally, I've had the best pho in Hanoi, so I had high expectations coming back that I knew wouldn't be surpassed in Toronto.

I ordered the Traditional Pho in a size Medium; though I wish there was a small size option because I can't eat too much in one sitting especially if I order appetizers to share with the table. Prices are reasonable; thought it would be more expensive but they have to compete with the cheaper places outside of the midtown area. The broth of the pho wasn't thick but rich with beef flavour and not oily. The Vietnamese owner and his chef(s?) know what they are doing because the broth should be the star of the meal - and it was. More complex flavours than the typical watery broth that you get for maybe $5-6 elsewhere; not quite as flavourful as what I had in Hanoi but comparable. Overall I was impressed and it's the best pho I've had in Toronto. Also, really like the option of building your own pho which is a neat idea (unfortunate that I refuse to eat tripe & tendon, it's a texture thing..).

I came with my family and we shared the Fried Spring Rolls and Fresh Shrimp Spring Rolls - both are 2 pcs cut into 4 slices, perfect for sharing. The fried spring rolls (made with pork) I wasn't too thrilled with because it tasted different than what I'm used to but still flavourful nonetheless, worth a try. I love fresh spring rolls, don't really like shrimp but these rolls were large and tasty especially with the dipping sauces provided for all rolls. We also ordered the Vietnamese Chicken Salad which was very fresh, perfectly lightly dressed and a good portion to split among 4 people. We also ordered a rice dish of Grilled Chicken and Egg, which was deliciously marinated and tender but not dry with lovely plate presentation. To wash everything down, I had their hot Vietnamese coffee which was phenomenal - perfect blend of bold rich taste with sweet condensed milk.

Left Pho King Fabulous very full & satisfied (albeit pretty sleepy hehe), prices were great for the portions and quality of food you are getting; especially with the pho. The service was nice and prompt, service with a genuinely kind smile :) I recommend!"}
{"text":"In comparison to other Pho restaurants in Toronto, I was so surprised by how light and flavourful their dac biet pho is. Not that oily and there was a good portion of meat to noodles. Service was really quick and I left feeling not too heavy and 100% satisfied. 

10/10 would come back again and I'd love to try their North Vietnamese pho."}
{"text":"3.5
pretty good no complaints.
nothing to rave about but pretty satisfiedwe had take out
liked that the soup base wasnt overly greasy.
portion wise a little light in comparison to other pho places.  

would definately come again but 3.5 on a scale of 5."}
{"text":"I am amazed by how delicious food here. Really enjoyed macaroni and pho. Fare warning: large is large. I can barely finish medium portion."}
{"text":"I was on a hunt for pho  and was shocked how far I had to walk, until I stumbled upon this joint. Great service, really cool interior, truly lovely name and the pho was paretty good; it could have been more flavourful though :/. I will be back on another day to give it another chance."}
{"text":"I highly recommend everyone to come! Food is great and the restaurant is really nice and clean! Portion size and price is reasonable. Had an enjoyable meal here on a Monday night :). I had the traditional beef pho."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place out before going to the movies. It's probably the cleanest restaurant I've ever been to when it comes to Viet food. Which makes me feel at ease thinking of how they prepare the food...anyways, once the food came (I had grilled chicken with rice, bf had trad pho) we were surprised at the portions! It was way more than what we would normally eat but because it was soo good we had to try and finish everything. Next time we're going to come here for some cheap drinks (beer and wine) and dinner before the comedy club."}
{"text":"ordered delivery via foodora .. crispy tofu was soft not crispy at all .. pho was ok should come with fried egg no charge .. one of the fried eggs was more scrambled than Sunnyside up .. soup and ingredients should come in two containers so that all you have to do is add soup to the other container"}
{"text":"I'm always realistic in my reviews- this one is harsh, but true. 

Absolutely \"PHOKING\" horrendous experience.

Ordered pho, spring rolls, deep fried tofu, and a rice vermicelli dish between 3 of us.

Pho came first. Got completely cold, then tofu arrived dripping in oil. The \"fabulous sauce\" was bottled sweet and sour sauce. 
After 3 separate reminders we got my friends main and the spring rolls. So by the time we started eating everything was cold.

The sauce container was empty at our table

And the shrimp in one of the pho bowls wasn't even cleaned properly 

Tasteless food, overworked hurried servers, and late service. 

Waste of money."}
{"text":"I was in the neighbourhood and stopped in because this restaurant was on a Top 50 best restaurants written by a former Globe and Mail critic.  It must be good, right?  Pho King Fabulous was good, but it shouldn't claim to be the best pho in the city.  I know at least three other places where the pho is just as good, if not better.  We also ordered the shrimp and rice dish Tôm nng.  It looked like an appetizer.  Very small.  The six small shrimp were overcooked and tasteless.  The dipping sauce was similarly tasteless.  Definitely not worth $13.  The service was fairly good, but there was one point where two of the staff were attending to a single table of two people and no one came by our table for more than ten minutes.  That grated a bit.  All in all, the pho was good, but I doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has nothing going for it beyond the funny name. 

The pho broth is really bland. The chicken was served undercooked (read: raw). Low quality ingredients.

Go for pho somewhere Pho King else!"}
{"text":"The name was the thing that attracted me to this place. This place doesn't have an atmosphere of a pho place, it's too clean. 

Anyway, the pho is good here. Broth is good, noodles good, beef is ok. However, when I go to a pho place I generally expect to be full after a \"large\" order but it really isn't as much as I had expected. The vietnamese spring rolls are really good. 

Verdict: It's good.
This place is slightly more expensive than other pho places but the taste is there. This place makes pho feel a little more classy than the other joints and it's not a bad thing really.

That's all."}
{"text":"Service was great, quick and efficient, but the portion for medium is oddly small. Other than that, the food was amazing and affordable for a student like myself. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I recently moved into the Yonge and Eglinton area and as a pho fanatic, I went out to this location after reading some of the yelp reviews about this place. The service was average but expected as the waiter was paying more attention to a large group of people that came in just before me. I ordered a large rare beef pho and fresh shrimp rolls. The rare beef they used was different than other places as it was more like a brisket slices (see photo below). Nonetheless, it was very delicious. However, the waiter made the mistake that I was taking out food and had to go back into the kitchen and fix the order. Also there were some stains on their glasses which deterred be from drinking during the meal. While the interior was a bit tacky (ex. yellow walls), the pho was definitely traditional and authentic.

So overall a nice place where if you are looking for authentic pho for a reasonable price, I would recommend going. I hope to try out the other pho places nearby before returning back to this one."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden treasure (as many places seem to be in Midtown). Their pork fresh rolls are life-changing! (and this comes from someone who really doesn't even like fresh rolls). Their pho is good too, of course. I think my only gripe is I wish the menu had a BIT more selection...but clearly they know what they do best, so they've focused on that."}
{"text":"We finished our Yoga class and walked across the street to this Pho restaurant. The spring rolls are awesome! There is a lot of meat in the Pho and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"I am a huge pho lover but was disappointed with their vegetable broth. It smelled and tasted like cinnamon. I tried to disguise the taste with lime and siracha but that didn't work. It was like eating noodles in a cup of tea. I ended up pouring the broth out but even then the food was still ruined. I think if the broth was better it would be very good pho. My boyfriend enjoyed his chicken pho."}
{"text":"I really liked the Viet style wonton soup on my first visit. I ordered a bubble tea to go which was given to me in a small coffee take out paper cup. The smallest and most expensive bubble tea I've ever had! Service was mediocre. They didn't really care since they had a larger group. 
I figured I would go back since food was good with a larger group of 9 between adults and teens. BIG MISTAKE, staff made several mistakes in our order, and did nothing to solve it. They forgot the water after asking them twice, brought extra soup and wouldn't take it back, my friend asked for extra broth because the noodles soaked it all and they wanted to charge her. We were rushed out of the restaurant by two separate staff members fifteen minutes before closing...overall, we felt like were an inconvenience for the staff. They really need a customer service course here."}
{"text":"My first Pho experience - the restaurant was incredibly spacious and pretty dead when we went. Food was absolutely delicious and I can't wait to return again in the future."}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered take out, so can't really comment on the restaurant experience.  But the food was always fast and very well done.  And the prices are great.

I have been dying for a good Pho soup place to open up in my hood and this place did not disappoint.  Love it."}
{"text":"The pho is small for the price and broth tastes pretty bland"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from just eat and it arrived earlier than expected. I ordered spring rolls, soup, and a smoothie. Spring rolls were cold and soggy but not so bad- would it been better hot and crunchy. The soup was extremely oily and had to remove the whole top layer with a spoon but was quite good after but regretted it later when my stomach hurt from the oil. Smoothie lacked flavour as if they added more ice than fruit which was sad. Won't be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Had my first visit at pho king yesterday, it was sort of a disappointment that they do not offer sugar cane shrimp. That's one of the signature Vietnamese dish! 

The restaurant is very clean and organized and the staffs are very helpful and friendly but for the food, let's say it's ok to visit pho king for a quick fix if you crave for pho but not a restaurant that you want to make a special trip for! 

I ordered pho P1 and grilled pork fresh roll. To me, they did not give enough meat for both the pho and the rolls and they did not taste that great either."}
{"text":"Excited to have a pho place in our area that I can walk too! The Pho is always delicious, fresh and hot. The broth is full of flavor and I never leave disappointed. A wonderful addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend with very discerning tastes we had a decent time. The place is well planned and brightly lit with very friendly staff. I noticed that the menu was slimmed down compared to other Vietnamese places I've frequented.

I got the wrong order but I didnt really say anything because it looked and tasted so good. Vegetables and rolls were very fresh and tasty, unlike other places with wet/slimy sprouts. Would come again"}
{"text":"Con:
The spring rolls taste like Costco bought then deep fried it's dry it doesn't taste like Vietnamese spring roll at all, it resemble closer to Chinese spring roll. I ordered rare eye round and tripe the tripe can't be found. The portion for large is smaller than I thought if I were to have pho in the area I would go for the star king it's just a block away with much larger portion, stuff, and variety. 

Pro:
 slight better broth, better decoration ."}
{"text":"Really nice set up and decor for a Pho restaurant. It's classy looking, but very casual. I was here during lunch hour. It wasn't too busy. 
The service is quick, but not friendly. Think of their customer service as a cross between Chinatown and McDonalds type friendliness. It's at most minimal.
I ordered the Fabulous Pho. It's supposed to have Beef balls, beef, tendon and tripe. There was virtually no tripe or tendon, to be found in my Pho.
Over all, the Pho itself is average. No need to go out of the way. (Unless you want a picture with their sign-because let's be honest. Best name for a Pho place ever!)
If I'm craving Pho and I'm in the area, I'd come back. But, wouldn't go out of the way to get there."}
{"text":"Was a tiny tad disappointed in this restaurant. Their pho comes with medium or large size and I went with the medium one (for around 9 dollars). The bowl was a lot smaller than I thought and hence came with very little meat as well. Their soup base felt a tad watered down as well. My friend was also not happy with his pho as well, he got rare beef but the beef was not rare at all."}
{"text":"Another review for Pho restaurant, and NO, I'm not tired writing these reviews :p

The restaurant is very clean and organized. Staffs are friendly and quick. But the food...Been here two times and ordered the same dish but got disappointed both times. I ordered Bun Bo Hue (and yeah it's my habit to look for Bun Bo Hue wherever I go).

1st time: The broth was bland and tasteless. I had to add more fish sauce to make it more flavourful and \"edible\". The whole dish came out cold. The portion, this time, was decent though.

2nd time: Nothing different much from the first time even though it was almost a 6 months gap. The broth was again... a disappointment. It was tasteless and also very oily. I had a really hard time finishing it. The bowl size is the same but the amount of meat wasn't enough with the price I paid. 

Since I came back the second time when they almost closed, I will give this restaurant another chance soon. And this last time I will order something else so I can give a better review about this place.

3 stars for the staffs and for the cleanliness of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I will like to say that I been close to this restaurant for work for the past week and I been coming here every day. The food is beyond amazing and service is great. The portions that they give are perfect and you get a lot for your money so if you are close by you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"Tried their pho, P2. While I did like the broth, I didn't like the rice noodles, which tasted too well cooked as if they had been \"swimming\" in the soup for awhile.

On my second visit, I got their shrimp vermicelli dish that came with spring rolls and some sauce, and it was much better but I've had a better tasting vermicelli dish elsewhere. I'd get their vermicelli dishes if I'm here again. Service was friendly and fast. Seems like the restaurant is new and it is clean."}
{"text":"This place just opened and we gave it a try.  First of all, hilarious name!  Very clever.  

The place was busy inside which is a good sign for a newly opened place.  It's a family owned place and everyone was very nice.  We ordered the vegetarian fresh rolls.  It came with a hoisin peanut sauce.  Pretty standard and delicious.  We also ordered the beef pho.  All the fixins were fresh and the broth was hot and not super salty.

Overall a welcome addition to the area.  I'd go back for my pho fix in a pinch."}
{"text":"We got the pho and the vermicelli. I'd describe everything as OK. The broth was a bit on the bland side and they did give us a decent amount of meat in the dish. The vermicelli again was on the bland side, but everything that was supposed to be there was there. That said, the decor is pretty decent for a pho place and I do love the name. I probably wouldn't come here again because there's just so many good places for pho in the city."}
{"text":"My first visit here occurred shortly after they opened and there were definitely some kinks to be worked out (lipstick on a water glass!), so I figured a return visit was required.

I once again ordered a \"Bun\" but this time I went with the Grilled Shrimps variation. We also ordered Shrimp Fresh Rolls as an appetizer.

Ten minutes later, our waitress returned to the table to confirm our orders - which I took to be a fairly bad sign, obviously. (I remarked to my dining companion that we were probably not getting that appetizer.) Another ten minutes passed and our food finally arrived, although the waitress placed the wrong plates in front of my dining companion and I.

She didn't, however, bring the sauce that always accompanies Bun, so I asked for that and also a fork. Minutes went by and no sauce and no fork, which left me staring longingly at my food. I finally got so fed up I had to go track down our waitress and ask for both a fork and the sauce, which she finally did bring over.

And just as we started digging into our meals, she brought over those Shrimp Fresh Rolls (of course!)

The food itself was extremely bland and forgettable. The bun was completely tasteless and that sauce was just as bad. The rolls fared even worse as it seemed like they were 90% lettuce.

(And, as if all this wasn't bad enough, there was a huge group of rowdy teenagers seated at the back and they were making more noise than one would have thought possible.)

This was a terrible, terrible dining experience. I'll never be returning."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place was so recommended by Joanne Kates Top 100 list. It's pretty average in every way."}
{"text":"I have bee in for take out about 7 times since they opened . I love it! Of course it's about the broth and its wonderful . Clever name ! The front of house staff are very very sweet and they really try to accommodate. In some cases there is a language barrier problem , Unfortunately that has deterred me on a couple of occasions already from goign as I was not up to that on that particular day. That is really a me issue and not a them issue because that is just part of living in a city . 
    Now, here is where it gets tricky . If you are like me and like to get take out and like your sauce be warned!!! They give you a very small amount of hoisin and Sriracha that is BOTH in ONE as I said way to small portion container. First I like and require MORE sauce I do NOT want my sauces already together . That is part of the Pho King fun of eating Pho King Pho !! I am not alone in that sauce thing as I have a friend that has had take out too a few times and mentioned he also does not like how they pack the sauce . If you are like me and want a lot of sauce and want it separate you will have to check your bag before you leave . Also you can ask for TWO of each sauce 8 times if you want they will only brig you ONE of each then you will have to ask yet again for another of each and wait while they do another trip . I have since solved the issue for myself and made sure I have my own hoisin and Sriracha at home. 
    NEXT I have had the traditional Pho P2 and V3 the vegetable noodle soup. The thing is I do not eat the beef, tendon or tripe ( texture thing, just not my thing) I love the beef broth however and I order the P2 with No meat . This proves to be a HUGE challenge for some reason and I can tell not from the lack of the front house staff trying. Each time it has been one mix up or another , they think I want tripe instead ( NOOOO) PHO KIING please NO! or that it means I don't want anything at all with it just noodles and broth , or that I should want to at least add broccoli to it. I really love the place and I am not ready to give up however ordering a P2 NO Pho King Meat should not be this difficult. My next order I will attempt a V3 with beef broth , that may be the easier way to execute this ?? I truly am not trying to difficult at all , I know for absolute certain that no meat is really not obscure, difficult or asking a lot . I mean I am not coming in there with a list of 15 allergies and 25 fallergies ( fake allergies , and we all know that happens) it is just a simple NO meat situation and I am not saying I am a vegetarian because I love the broth. Just no meat please , easy easy easy . 
   Those are unfortunately the difficulties I have encountered. As I said the staff are lovely , kind and they truly try , the broth is great, the place looks clean , The Vietnamese coffee looks GREAT af I want to try that. I have had their bubble tea and I am NOT a fan of how they do theirs as it comes out more like a thick slushy and I know and prefer bubble tea to be watery over ice or no ice not like a slushy thing. However some may like it that way, this is just my preference. 
   I was there today and I felt really bad for the staff because they were not full but busy enough with the tables they had, the take out orders ( me being one) Two servers on , a cook from the kitchen kept coming out serving tables looking rather wide eyed and stressed , the girl serving me unfortunately was chained behind the bar making really very time consuming coffees and bubble teas . This was clearly the issue because for her to make these drinks takes her away from her section for far to long . The other server was starring into the POS and to me it looked as if he was not yet confident with it or it was a language barrier. In addition they had disgruntled guests coming up to the front and complaining about no service and one table marched out in a huff. I felt really bad because it was evident that if it had not been for these Pho King bubble teas and coffees this would not be falling apart as it was . 
  Perhaps  during busy times they may want to consider someone , even a manager as it would not be a lucrative bar position but someone to run the bar and do take out and drinks over the busy period , This way they don't risk walk outs, mistakes and unhappy guests. 
    I won't give up on Pho King Fabulous as the food is GREAT! The area needs it as who doesn't love a great Pho ? I wish them all the best and support them .

{"text":"My go to order is P5: Hue Spicy Beef Noodle -
Bún Bò Hu. It has a Tom Yum flavour with large circular noodles."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of being invited to the Friday grand opening, but was able to fit my first visit in on a rainy Sunday afternoon.
The Viet Pho features a clean, flavourful broth with strong notes of rich beef and little salt.  The spring rolls and rice paper rolls are quite fresh and delicious as well.
The food is excellent, marking that late May 2015 opening weekend with the best Pho I've had in years.  I would highly recommend this place for the quality, portion sizes, authentic Viet style, cleanliness, customer service, and price!
It just so happens that I live only a few minutes away, making this Viet restaurant my go-to for Pho and Bun."}
{"text":"Good pho super close to home - can't go wrong with that!  I have to admit that I've had better pho in China town, but for a quick fix, this is perfect! 

Very quick service and friendly waitstaff too!"}
{"text":"If you are a cilantro HATER, this is your place! I ordered my Pho and as always requested no cilantro. I almost jumped out of my seat when they said they don't put cilantro in their Pho! Then I asked for extra green onion, and they asked me if it was OK if there was white onion (not cilantro) mixed in, I said this is my kind of restaurant! If I understood the waiter correctly (he did have a Vietnamese accent), he said they didn't like cilantro either so they don't use it.  All I can say is Pho King Fabulous!"}
{"text":"Not very flavourful... Protein portions are really small. Overall, a rip off. You can find better elsewhere... Anywhere."}
