{"text":"It's not been half an hour since I walked out of Haweli and I'm on Yelp writing this review. I hope that is as good an understatement as I can make as to how TERRIFIC this restaurant is. Where do I start??? The ambiance, the service, the food..!!! I'm at a loss!!!

It is my son's second birthday today and my family and I being new to AZ did not have anyone to celebrate it with. So we decided to walk down to Haweli (it helps that we live right behind the restaurant) and treat ourselves to a quiet dinner. In hindsight, that has to be the best decision we've taken today.

We walked in and were immediately greeted by Gopi (he's one of the two guys who run this place). We chose our own seats and Gopi got us the toddler seat for our son. The place was tastefully done with grand chandeliers, ample lighting and great decor We were given water (even that tasted awesome) and they were very understanding when we asked for a little more than the usual time in placing the order since we had to get our son settled first. We ordered the masala pappad, chicken pakora, garlic naan, tandoori shrimp masala and chicken biriyani. We loved the pakora which was basically succulent tandoori chicken covered with the traditional pakora wrap. It came with the mint and sweet and sour chutneys which were superb as well. The garlic naan was just perfect and the shrimp masala was out of this world. The gravy was thick and savory while the shrimp was marinated and cooked to perfection. My wife thought the chicken biriyani was great, however she found it to be different from the Kerala flavored chicken biriyani that we are more used to. Nevertheless, she really liked it.

Despite there being no complimentary rice with curries, we were given a full portion of rice at no cost. But the icing on the cake was yet to come. When Gopi got to know that it was my son's birthday, he got us three huge fantabulous Mango lassies \"on the house\"!!! All portions of food were easily sufficient for 2 pax. If you are used to Indian food, a spice index of 7/10 should be just fine. (We could've gone for 8 but then wanted to keep it a little mild for our toddler). The wait time was just a little over 10-12 mins which I thought was very reasonable. 

Finally, a word on the \"people\". When the lady waitressing on you has seen more of India than you have managed in your entire existence, you know you are in good hands. Marissa was not just knowledgeable about the menu, but she also was seen helping out guests unfamiliar to Indian cuisine what to choose. She was super friendly and courteous. Gopi and Pradeep both individually walked up to us during various times and checked if we were ok and made it a point to talk to us while we were leaving. They have plans to expand the menu with more south Indian varieties such as Dosa, vada etc. being introduced. I can only imagine myself queuing up by the Haweli every morning in a little while to start off my day with authentic south Indian cuisine.

While the signature of every restaurant is the quality of the food that is served, for me, the team that gets you the food (right from your table to the kitchen and back) are the ones who leave an indelible mark on you.  I have been overwhelmed by the warmth and care shown by the staff. They were constantly looking for feedback from us on how to improve the menu, food, service and presentation. To me, that is the hallmark of a restaurant that looks set to be doing excellent business in times to come!!!

***
The price is VERY reasonable for the quantities and quality that they offer. And they are running a 15% off on all meals until end of July."}
{"text":"Awesome buffet, great service and definitely the best Indian food in Scottsdale by far, we've tried them all!"}
{"text":"If you want to treated with respect then this is definitely not the place for you.
After having read all the great reviews, we went there this evening.
The staff were ice cold and not customer friendly.
BUT, the worst was that we never got any food and no one told us why.
The couple next to us were waiting over an hour with no food.
After calling the manager over, I enquired why.
She told me not to make a scene........a large catering order was occupying the five cooks in the kitchen......
A very large restaurant with only six tables occupied but they could not serve them any food....."}
{"text":"Worst indian food. Total waste of money. Lunch buffet is $12 with only small selection of food. Chicken is the worst I ever had. Sweet dish ( gulab jamun) very strange taste. I came with group of people, and was embarrassed to be the host. I am going back there unless they change the cook and increase selection."}
{"text":"first time, got take-out on a Monday night.  We ordered the spinach crispy fried appetizer thing it came in a styrofoam container, opened the container when I got home and immediately I smelled the familiar smell of old burnt oil.  Guys, change your fryer oil frequently!  Gross...  Oh, by the way, the hot fried appetizer had melted the styrofoam.  How about putting a piece of paper towel in there so that it doesn't melt the styrofoam?  Is eating food that has melted the styrofoam even healthy?  

Onward:  Vegetable Samosa:  meh.  A bit dry, these were probably old.  Chicken Tikka Masala:  flavors were good but not enough chicken in the container.  Seemed like maybe 6 ounces of chicken, maybe less, for $13?  The Lamb Korma- same thing as the chicken, sauce tasted good but not enough meat.  Finally we had a Chicken Tikka (not Masala, just normal chicken on the bone w/ roasted onions) well it tasted good but there wasn't enough of it.  

The Naan was burned to blackness on one side, the other side was golden brown.  The rice was tasty but I'm used to getting more from most other places.  We ordered 2 of them but I think we should have ordered 4.  

Clearly no one is caring too much what happens in the kitchen.  It seems some items are good but then again some are not good.  Not enough attention to detail, in my opinion.  

This place has potential, it might be good if the boss is around and doing a better job of watching over the kitchen."}
{"text":"I want to give 5 stars because the food is great. All fresh and really good. Saag paneer medium wow! All The bread options, hell yeah! The waiters are nice but not the most outgoing so don't expect benihana. Also not the fastest thus the 4 star. Did I mention the food is sooo good and fresh! Come for the food, drink to forget any service issues. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Maybe Haweli was having opening blues, because I'm surprised by the bad reviews. My sister & I both loved it. We each got the thali platters so we could sample; I got veg, she ordered chicken tikka masala & this is our only criticism: you get a choice of 2 different dishes & she asked for both of them to be the tikka; the chef gave her something else for one of her main dishes. Our waiter offered to bring it back, but she decided to keep it. When we ordered extra pappadum, he then brought a double order & didn't charge us. The raita was unusual (never had it with potatoes before!) & I prefer the standard cucumber raita but that's what going to different restaurants is all about. Our waiter was very attentive but not intrusive & we will definitely go back! I'm originally from NYC & used to go to 7th street in the East Village (Indian Row) & used to bemoan the lack in Scottsdale; no more! Forgot to mention we used a Groupon: show it to them before you get the bill."}
{"text":"We found this gem on Yelp while looking for  Indian food after seeing the movie, The 100 foot Journey!  Although new, and very few patrons there at the time, the food was GREAT!  Chicken Tikki Masala was fabulous.  The service was attentive and friendly. Hoping they will do well, as the location is quiet...but the food fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. So flavorful and satisfies all the Indian cravings you could want!"}
{"text":"We found this recently opened Indian food restaurant totally by accident. We had just watched a delightful Indian film at Shea 14 (The Lunchbox) and  were wishing for Indian Food. As we drove away we noticed a notice under our wiperblades: an announcement of a nearby new Indian restaurant, Haweli! 

We drove right over and were pleasantly surprised by the ambiance, the wait staff (and owners were there too). The food, was absolutely incredible. We did not eat much, a vegetable byriani, a yellow lentil soup, and my favorite Aloo Gobi, which is cauliflower and potatoes in a curry-like sauce. However it was enough to know we need to go back soon!
We will definitely return when hungry for Indian food and recommend it very highly."}
{"text":"Hi All,

At first it appeared to be a decent place, was even impressed with it. But then there's this list of things happened which made me think otherwise, would NEVER visit that place again !

1. The owner was pretty rude and arrogant, I was taken aback ! Hospitality goes in the trash ! Wonder how he is running the place !

2. Chicken tandoori was soaked/floating in water in the tray. The artificial red/pink color made it quite repelling !

3. Palak paneer was no good.

4. All variety of chicken curries tasted almost the same, just with different shades of red.

My huge turn off was the attitude the owner had towards his customer ! This reviews being long overdue actually.

Hope it helps !"}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant I have been! I have been to easily over 300 Indian restaurants in last 10 years. Place was spacious, nice decor and our waiter was very welcoming. We ordered Goat Korma and Chicken Tikka which was very delicious. I have ordered medium, it seemed little spicy for medium, but loved the spice as I took more bites. 

Naan was good and service was really good too. I will be coming back for sure!

My wife'r rating was 4.5/5 conservatively, as she said."}
{"text":"After reading reviews here on Yelp I've decided to update everyone on Haweli since they've been open almost 4 weeks now. 

They are currently serving alcohol and have 4 beers on tap and 3 bottled Indian beers, a small selection of wine, and liquor.

AND everything is 15% off until the end of June"}
{"text":"wow...tried dinner here and this place was just plain awful, the only plus was the service, not enough flavor in the food, sorry won't be retuning"}
{"text":"The food was very delicious! Genuine Indian
Food with delicious spices. The menu was very interesting and included goat as well lamb and chicken. We had the goat achali
Which was so delicious. The meat was very tender and flavorful . We also had saag paneer which was outstanding and I've had it many places. The sauce was very creamy and perfectly seasoned. Bhinbi masala which is okra with onions and tomatoes was great . Okray enough and well spiced.
The server was very friendly and helpful and knowledgeable about the menu!
The location is set well back from the street in an old shopping center that we didn't even know existed and we live in neighborhood. Once you find it its well worth it! Definitely coming back so delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good quality & tasting North Indian food! Coming from NJ where good Indian Food is common every 3 miles, I have high standards. Unfortunately, the atmosphere needs a more polished, update. I would suggest playing some background music. The quietness, really hurt the atmosphere. Thankfully, the food and service measured up. We'd definitely return."}
{"text":"I am a great fan of good Indian food, so am always excited when a new Indian restaurant opens.  We visited on a Sunday evening and only 3 other tables were occupied in the cavernous dining area. The bar area was deserted, but it looked well stocked offered 4 draught beers and numerous bottled beers. The decor was very old world, almost colonial with chandeliers and dark wood, and no flocked wallpaper in sight.  There are several tv around the walls, but mostly displaying the Direct TV logo, but one TV was quietly playing an old black and white period movie with the sound turned well down, rather a nice touch!

The staff were without exception very gracious and attentive, and service was quite fast.

We ordered Chicken Jalfrezi, Lamb Vindaloo and Paneer Masala.   The sauce with the paneer was judged the favorite, creamy and not overpowering flavor. The jalfrezi had a nice flavor, but possibly had a little too much curry paste for my taste.  There were plenty of peppers and onions to give it a nice crunchy texture. My major complaint was that every piece of chicken contained gristle which was a bit awkward as my dining companion, the delectable Kristina, does not look kindly upon people who take gristle from their mouths and place it on the side of the plate.  Apparently one is supposed to surreptitiously spit it out into a handkerchief when no one is looking. Anyway, I had no handkerchief, so....

The lamb was not as spicy hot as Kristina likes it, but she was brought up in Thailand so her heat senses were somewhat numbed when she was a child.  She thought there was too much potato vs. lamb, but still enjoyed it.   We did ask for some accompanying chutney, but they apparently don't have that available.  We had some good home made lime pickle instead.

We had some carrot halwa for desert, but it seemed rather old and dried up, and had clearly been warmed up in the microwave.

Overall we had a reasonably good although not outstanding meal, but did feel it was a little expensive, about $12.50 per dish, with rice another $2.50, so would have certainly preferred better quality chicken.  They offer buffets, so will be giving that a try soon."}
{"text":"I went to Haweli Indian earlier today and is a pretty, new restaurant in the Shea 14 Harkins area (like one major plaza away more west on Shea). The dining area is decorated very nicely and gives the feel of an upscale restaurant. All the tables were adorned with really nice Indian style table clothes on top of the standard nice white ones, with water glasses and golden napkins. Beautiful chandeliers hung all over the restaurant area and there were TV's available for viewing sports. We were greeted immediately and shown to a table of our choice while the waitress arrived and filled our water glasses. The waitress was very knowledgeable of the cuisine and was able to describe it very well. They have a large menu that is well detailed with descriptions of what each dish contained. They brought out this cracker style bread and some dipping sauces before we ordered, one sauce was tamarind based and was nice and sweet while the other was green and I think cilantro based and remind me of previous Indian food I've had. We ordered the garlic naan bread (A must) Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Madras, and the Tandoori Chicken with rice. All three of the chicken dishes were excellent, the Madras was the most spicy and went really well with the Partha bread. The Tandoori was a nice lightly spiced grilled chicken with vegetables that is definitely the safest choice for the non adventurous members of the group. Then there was the Chicken Tikka Masala it had such delicious spices with a nice sweet after taste. It went excellently with the rice, went excellent with the Naan and was awesome by itself. Definitely the must have dish here, so if you're only going to get one I suggest this but everything was delicious so there probably are no bad choices. I will venture out a little next time I come, but I think I'm going to make the Tikka Masala a staple with any party I come with. Overall they have really great service, excellent food, and a beautiful atmosphere. This place should be on anyone who is in the areas; must try list. Go experience it yourself, hopefully you have an experience similar to mine and if you do I know you'll want to come back. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat Indian food on a regular basis. Usually we go down to tempe to the numerous awesome Indian restaurants down there but yesterday we were kinda lazy--and it was raining so we decided to order take out closer to home. I found Haweli on yelp and placed our order: karabi paneer, fish curry, garlic naan, plain naan and EXTRA rice. 

They left out the plain naan and the rice was about 1/3 of a cup which is unacceptable for two entrees--even for one. Definitely no extra rice.

Too bad cause the food was really tasty--not as good as tempe but good enough that we would have gone back on a regular basis considering the amount of Indian food that we eat and that is it so much closer to home. 

They lost two customers that would have spent a lot of money just so that they can save a few pennies on rice."}
{"text":"Just got back from a wonderful meal at Haweli's.  The place is spacious and the decor is attractive.  They were having a big party so they offered us tables wherever we wanted.  Some places turn you away when they are having a party.  Not Haweli, they welcomed us.   We noticed that they didn't serve us complementary papadum (lentil crackers) and accompanying chutneys & tamarind sauce that other restaurants offer.  We missed that.  As an appetizer we ordered ground beef samosas.  We were surprised as most indian restaurants don't serve beef.  The samosas were served with coriander chutney and tamarind sauce and were pretty large and tasty.  I took advantage of the presence of beef and ordered beef vindaloo.  Hubby ordered Haweli biryani which has both lamb and chicken.  Finally we ordered a whole wheat paratha without butter.  The beef vindaloo was tasty but slightly salty.  Not enough to keep me from cleaning my plate though.  A note to the chef--hold the salt on the vindaloo.  The biryani was exquisite-- perfectly cooked, plenty of meat, the meat perfectly cooked, not greasy--don't know what else to say other than perfect!  The paratha bread was tasty and came as ordered without butter.  You don't know what a problem that can be at some restaurants as they automatically put butter on bread.  All in all the meal was really good.
The service was spot on.  \"Datpir\" was our waiter.  Our apologies because we have probably misspelled his name.  But he was attentive and answered all our questions throughout the meal.  We didn't have many because we have experience eating indian food, but  he was available none the less.  This restaurant has been open only two weeks and it promises to be a place where Scottsdale residents can enjoy good indian food.  BTW, they don't serve liquor but the serve the usual indian drinks such as mango lassie.  They have a buffet 7 days a week which we plan to partake of real soon so we can experiment with different dish.  
Thanks for a great meal and much luck with your new place."}
{"text":"First, the surcharge for Groupon has gone away. Same price for all. No problem using the Groupon except they weren't sure how to process it off my phone app. (But now they do, so no problem there.)

Second, the lunch buffet is one of the better ones I've experienced. All the usual chicken and vegetable dishes, with some extra desserts not usually offered on buffet, laid out attractively. My friend especially liked the butter chicken, samosas, seasoned rice, and rasmalai (\"cottage cheese\" dessert). I favored the puffy naan, mushroom curry, a couple of the chicken dishes (but not the tandoori chicken, which was pretty dry),, the complimentary mango lassi, and the golub dessert, which was the best I've had since an Indian friend cooked it for me in her home.

The service was very good, helpful without hovering. The room is too spacious, really, but my friend and I lingered long over tea so we were obviously comfortable there. A plus is the free parking garage below the restaurant. Returning to a (relatively) cool car in the Phx afternoon makes for a happy ending to an outing, no? Yes!"}
{"text":"after reading all the great reviews we went there and believe me after waiting for almost an hour(though there was only 5-6 tables were occupied) what we got a awful food.we ordered tandoori mixed grill and chicken biriyani,tandoori served with normal temperature which should not to be and what can I say for biriyani.It was salt-less and just not like as biriyani from any grain of it.when we told the waitress about it they behaved like it was normal and gave us a salt shaker.and not to mention that raita is not free here for biriyani.they charged you nearly 3 dollars for a small awkward tasted raita..we had a really bad dinner that day..:("}
{"text":"Horrible service!! I had been to this restaurant once before and the food was good so decided to come back for a date night with my boyfriend. When we arrived the place was pretty empty but it seemed like they were preparing for an event. The host found a table for us, we sat down and waited about 20 minutes for the waiter to take our order. A full hour went by and we never got our food after we inquired a couple of times!!! We were both starving, so we ended up leaving after we wasted 1.5 hrs there!  Pretty disappointed about the lack of customer service!!!"}
{"text":"GROUPON WARNING!

Went here for the lunch buffet with a GROUPON.  The buffet was limited to only tandori chicken, curry chicken and a few other non impressive side dishes.  The garlic naan had no taste.  The vegetable pakoras were over fried, dried out and really greasy.  I couldn't eat them.  The place was over decorated and the gold satin napkins were over the top!   The service was not good either.

The kicker was, they brought me my bill BEFORE I told them I had a GROUPON.  My bill was $20.23 and I had a $20.00 GROUPON.  I showed the GROUPON to the server and he gave it to the Manager.  When the manager brought my bill back, he had scratched out my old total and ADDED and ADDITIONAL $4.00 (and change). He actually scratched out my old total and added an extra $4.00 + !  I asked why and he told me it was because I had a GROUPON and people with GROUPONS pay 15% more than without a GROUPON.  I couldn't believe it!    Never going back there!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The waitress was nice. It was very quiet as they just recently opened and it's in the back of the parking structure. The food came out quick. Portions are small so keep that in mind while ordering . Watch out for the spice !!! Woo it can be hot if you ask for it. I had the chicken curry, garlic naan and some samosas , samosas were the best"}
{"text":"I tried Haweli while in Scottsdale on a business trip.  Because I arrived before 6 PM, I was the only customer there when I began my meal, so I can't comment on how good the service is during peak dinner hours.

I ordered vegetable Somosas, Chicken Korma, and Naan.  The Somosas were good, but not exceptional.  The Korma, however, was the best I've had in many years.  The chicken was tender and perfectly cooked, and the curry was sublime - I can't think of anything the cook could have done to make it tastier.

It's hard to rate a restaurant on the basis of a single meal, but if the rest of the menu is as good as my meal was, this restaurant deserves the rating I've given it."}
{"text":"Very good food. Nicely spiced at our own choice. Lamb Vindaloo was excellent, Tandoori Chicken was excellent, Shrimp meal was excellent. Very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I can't review the food, because we wound up getting up and leaving when they refused our Groupon, telling us they no longer were honoring them, even though they still have one currently for sale on the Groupon site. There was no way we were going to stay and eat there, when they knew we'd paid for the Groupon, and were not upright enough to take it (it is a valid Groupon, not expired). There was one other couple in the whole, unappealing looking place at 6PM on a Friday night. I'd guess they're not doing well, and with this attitude, I can see why. People buy Groupons to try out a place to see if they'll go back, and we were looking for a good Indian restaurant closer to our home than Jewel in the Crown. This will not be it."}
{"text":"I was one of their very first customers shortly after they opened.  I loved this place and actually registered on Yelp specifically to give them a good review for both food and service, both of which I thought were outstanding (5-star).

Since that time I've been back dozens of times.  In general, there food is still excellent, as is \"usually\" their service.  I was so impressed that I've taken dozens of couples there for dinner since June 2014.  Most of them returned and took friends.  I would frequently purchase coupons to help me offset this.  However, with three coupons at home, I had one that was about to expire, so my wife and I went about a week before it was to expire.  They refused to accept our coupon.  I spoke with the owner/manager (who knew me after all my visits) and told him that not honoring existing coupons would hurt him, but he didn't seem to care.  My wife got up from the table and said \"let's leave.\"  There were only two other tables with customers, probably 50 empty tables, and they turned us away.  I, like others, see that they are now again offering coupons but after spending two weeks with DoubleTakeOffers and Groupon getting my money back, I've not been willing to purchase anymore.  Therefore, I've not recommended or taken any more people to their restaurant.

I fear this place won't make it, which is too bad because they have very good food.  I believe their primary problems are (1) location, off the main street and sits way back in a strip mall that doesn't get a lot of traffic, (2) the size of their restaurant is very large, therefore probably high rent and it always looks empty even when there are a few tables occupied, but (3) their primary problem seems to be management.  They have a good cook, but don't appear to understand how to run a restaurant.  In addition, I happen to know there has been some significant changes in ownership since it initially opened; there were originally 3 partners but now there's only one left.

Their lunch buffet is a good value, actually a much better deal than their dinners.
  
I really like their naan bread.  They offer plain and garlic with their buffet.  I've tried both and must admit their garlic naan does not have much of a garlic taste.  Their food in general has some of the best \"tastes\" of any Indian restaurant I've ever been to.

I've only been back once since we were turned away.  My wife won't go back.  So I went for their lunch buffet and thought it was excellent.

I believe what this place needs is a \"professional manager.\""}
{"text":"*This review is based solely on service because no one ever came to take our order.**

Two of us were seated at 6:30p in a restaurant with only 3 other tables taken. Two had their orders on the table, one's was being taken. 

After we were seated, 4 other tables were seated, two were seemingly Indian families. Literally every other table that was seated after us was tended to (sometimes having to walk directly past our table to approach them). There were 4 servers working the room. 

Even after eye contact, we were ignored. We stood up and crossed the enormous restaurant to the door at 6:53p. No one approached us or tried to ask if there was an issue. 

I considered telling them we were there first and still hadn't even been spoken to by a server, but since we weren't feeling comfortable and certainly didn't want to pay $14 a meal for that kind of service, we left. 

Check out Karaikudi Palace farther east on Shea. They're quick, polite and delicious."}
{"text":"The decor is a little formal but the food is terrific. On par with anything I've tried in LA which is a great city for Indian Food."}

Authentic indian dishes, nice atmosphere and all around amazing people.

Prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"We have tried many Indian restaurants in the Phoenix area and we both agreed this was by FAR the best!!  I had the butter chicken and saag paneer and  paneer naan.  Everything was served very hot and fresh and was just delicious!  I can't wait to go back and try their buffet and was happy to hear it is also served on the weekends.  Our waitress was very friendly and the manager came over to make sure we were happy with our meal as well.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I have had since moving to Phoenix from NY. I have tried dozens of other restaurants which all fall short. I haven't eaten in the restaurant, but I have gotten take-out from this place many times and they are consistently good. I always try the chicken tikka masala which I use as the comparison for all restaurants and it was terrific. I also recommend the baingan bharta with some raita as an accompaniment. Since I found this place, I haven't eaten Indian anywhere else. As a bonus, they will deliver if you live close and hit a minimum charge."}
{"text":"I have to preface this review by saying I've been to Haweli twice, wasn't blown away the first time, and wanted to try it again with a DoubleTake Offer to lessen the cost a bit if I wasn't completely happy. Unfortunately, the wrench in this plan was the restaurant deciding a month and a half ago not to honor ANY of the Groupon or DoubleTake offer vouchers that had been purchased for use at their location. I purchased this particular offer back in June (a $15 for $30 voucher) and with a value expiration of 12/1 I figured I needed to give this restaurant another try, especially when I wasn't in the mood to cook after Thanksgiving.

We were greeted warmly at the entrance (we were the only people in the place at 7pm) and were seated promptly. After ordering lamb vindaloo, chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, and appetizers we settled in for dinner. I was disappointed to see that the tablecloth was not completely clean and my son's chair had food on it from another diner. I'm usually pretty easygoing about those things (I care much more about the food), but it set a precedent. I did enjoy the tikka masala, I thought the flavors were just right and the right amount of creamy. The lamb vindaloo was lacking in lamb (plenty of potatoes), but the spice was just right with a good amount of bite. I also was impressed with the saag paneer, something hard to get wrong, but not enjoyable if it doesn't have the right flavors.

I want to like this place because there aren't a lot of Indian options in the Scottsdale area, but I've had much better just down the freeway in Mesa and will be taking my business there (India Oven).

Of course, the worst insult was not honoring our voucher. Though I intend to get my value back from DoubleTake, to me this is a clear bait and switch to get advertising and patrons in the door. I don't eat out a lot for pleasure, but when I do I expect to get what I pay for, and this told me what kind of people are managing this business."}
{"text":"We now call it the Haweli Clense!

The atmosphere was desolate, the food smelled a little fishie (even though we didn't have fish).  Staff was nice though:)

We ordered vegetable korma and it did not even resemble a Korma.  It seemed to have frozen vegetables in it.  The beef kabob was unrecognizable.  The chicken dish whatever it was (I have tried to block it out of my mind and insides;/)  was disgusting.  The nan was so tough it would pull out my Granny's teeth!

We all ate a few bites and left.  But the amount we all ate was enough to keep us home bound the next day.

Skip this place unless you have time to sit home:)"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. The decor is awful. The server didn't seem too swift & wasn't that accommodating at first. He may not be used to Scottsdale clientele. I'm not really sure if they are trying to appeal to Indians or the mainstream but they should get rid of that awful Indian TV/Indian music videos. I did not care for them & if they are trying to appeal to everyone then they are not doing a good job. The place is way too big. I hope they make it but unfortunately every restaurant that has been there fails. They should have chosen another location. I wouldn't waste my $$ on a remodel, just move. But the food is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"ate for dinner and loved it got the Thali special! was very happy with the food! excellent well developed bold flavors! delicious curries. wonderful tandoori meats. the staff are attentive and friendly. great atmosphere. best in this part of town by far!"}
{"text":"Tried going to lunch there a couple weeks ago and it was taped off and closed.  Tried calling the number to see if they were still open and the number is no longer in service.    Bummer, wanted to try this place!"}
{"text":"We threw my Dad a surprise retirement party at Haweli. I had eaten here a few months ago. The ambiance, food, and service were all good that day and based on those reasons, in addition to the restaurant's capacity to hold a party, it was an easy decision to book the party here.

The openness has a Wow factor for an Indian restaurant and the decor is modern. The bar is big and there is a raised area that's perfect for a private party.

I interfaced directly with Narender and he was very accommodating and professional. He not only worked with us on what we wanted, but also came up with solutions to make the dinner experience more affordable and of the highest quality.

We had samosas, pakoras, paneer masala, malai kofta, lentils, kadhi pakora, raita, plain and garlic naan, rice, papad, raas malai,and gulab jamun. Everything was tasty. We asked for the food to be spicy and it was the perfect level of spicy for our group.

At the end of the day, we got the food quality we wanted, the service we wanted, the professionalism we wanted, and the price we wanted.

Thanks, Haweli!"}

My wife and I eat Indian food often, and we can tell you the food here is good, really good.  But the place was EMPTY.  It needs, and DESERVES, lots of customers  So, come on in soon. You will be glad that you did.

Back to the food.  First, a couple of comments about what other reviewers have said.  1.  We received free papadam with condiments.  2.  We had beers, so they must have a liquor license.

Next, we had the lamb saag and the chicken korma.  All of the lamb in the lamb saag was flavorful and tender.  Not like the gristle and tough pieces you sometimes get elsewhere.  It was excellent.  The chicken korma was also excellent,  Flavorful and tender.  And both dishes were served hot, not \"luke-cold\" like so many restaurants.

Next, the bread was also served hot.  It hadn't been sitting on a shelf for 15 minutes waiting for the entrees to get ready.  Really tasty.

So, any nits?? Well, okay.  Three small nits.   First, as one reviewer mentioned, the spice level seemed high.  We like a lower spice level, so we asked for a \"3\" on a scale of \"10.\"  It seemed more like a \"3\" on a scale of \"5.\"  Too hot for us.  But our wonderful server Marisa was quick with a solution.  She brought us a cupful of raita (yogurt and cucumber sauce) that when mixed with the rice really cooled things down.  Thanks, Marisa.

But speaking of rice, there was an extra charge for it.  I know it was only $1.99, but it strikes us as nickel and diming for a Scottsdale restaurant.  It's not as though the entrees were extra cheap. 

Finally, and this is just personal taste, I like my beer to be cold, not luke-warm.  Maybe the Brits who ruled India for a century like warm beer, but I'm guessing an American crowd in Scottsdale wants their beer cold.  AT least the mug was cold.

But those are nits.  The message here is that the food was terrific and we will be back  You should go, too."}

There was a very nice waitress, who had to greet and seat, wait and bus tables. Management had no presence. I suggest they change that if they want to stay in business."}
{"text":"Nice place, generous folks, good hygiene, well-priced, good variety...Will be back again"}
{"text":"This place sucks!. Waste of money.. Very bad food and service.. I went for lunch buffet, there were no options at all.. the food tasted bad and one of the dishes was spoiled.. Worst indian place ever!"}
{"text":"Slow service and their \"spicy\" was anything but spicy, even after making some extra effort to ensure that the food would have a substantial heat level.  It was supposed to be \"Indian hot\", above the 10/10.  But no, it wasn't.  Portions were reasonable, bread was ok.  Review for dinner experience only.  Have not tried lunch."}
{"text":"Second time here.  The food is excellent. The best indian I have had.  Most places are hot or miss with quality and flavor. 2 times we've eaten here. 2 times we have been VERY impressed. Our new favorite!!"}
