{"text":"I've been going to Easy Street now for years because I work in the building and it's a convenient place to come with friends.  Although I'm not a big fan of the food I would often come down for happy hour on Fridays.  On a whim I decided to give the food another chance and pick up something from the side take-out area for lunch.  To make a long story short, I have never been treated so rudely.  After 20 minutes of standing around waiting for my wrap to be ready, I was denied what I ordered because I'm pregnant.  The man making the wrap felt it was his duty to make substitutions to my food without asking me.  I overheard him telling the cashier.  When I said I didn't want the wrap that way he said, \"That's it. End of story.\"  I immediately asked for my money back, which I got.  But I left empty-handed after being humiliated and wasting half of my lunch break. 
I overheard the manager tell the cashier that the wrap-maker was totally ridiculous and that he would be talked to.  No one said a word of apology to me.  I will never go to Easy Street again."}
{"text":"Although I have not yet been able to try the food, I feel than an update to my original review is appropriate. After learning of my sub-par experience, the event coordinator reached out to me to apologize and assure me that she would take the appropriate steps to correct the underlying issues. She was contrite and seemed to be genuinely concerned with my bad experience. 

In my opinion, customer service is as important as price, quality, and atmosphere. Mistakes happen and every one of us has bad days. It's how a restaurant corrects those mistakes that separates a good restaurant from a great restaurant. I am now convinced that my experience was an isolated incident, rather than a regular occurrence. 

I will definitely return to Easy Street in the near future, and will recommend the restaurant to family and friends. I'm hoping that their food is as good as their customer service! If that turns out to be the case, I'll likely update my review to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Food is awful! And I didn't meet a employee that wasn't a jerk (to say the least). The only good thing about the place was the bar. draft beer system was amazing and it was also clean I enjoyed it very much but I do not recommend the service there it was disappointing."}
{"text":"\"You're not going to order one of those Ninja Turtle pizzas again are you?\" That's the question I usually get from friends at pizza joints. Why you ask, because I like to pile up my pizzas with all kinds of good (and usually healthy) stuff to the point that a slice is almost impossible to pick up.

While Easy Street has an awesome looking menu, I went straight for the pizza and will go right back to the same thing next time I'm there. My basic, build your own pizza looked something like this....margarita pizza, easy on the cheese, with chicken, braised pork (first time I've ever had that on a pizza), hot peppers, mushrooms, artichokes, spinach and fresh basil (which was shredded and piled on high)...the whole thing was delicious. 

It's the first time I've ever seen braised pork offered as a topping, but however the chef prepared it, I thought it was amazing.

The atmosphere is pretty cool too. The restaurant is at the bottom of Oxford Center in Pittsburgh and has a large dining room and bar area, as well as plenty of outdoor seating. A large garage door serves as a wall and in the summer is lifted up give that outdoor feel to the more comfortable, air conditioned dining room.

They've also got a great beer list and while I haven't been there for happy hour, I did notice that it always seems to draw a crowd."}
{"text":"I had the Cajun wings with homemade potato chips. The food was good and I liked the atmosphere. The highlight for me was the service. Kyna(pronounced keena) was our waitress and she was top-notch. Probably top five best experiences I've had at a restaurant in Pittsburgh. A little pricey, but I didn't mind at all. Hell, everything is pricey nowadays."}
{"text":"Easily the worst lunch I have had in Pittsburgh in years. I ordered the tuna taco which was billed, as they usually are, as tuna with cilantro. The plate came and there were 2 ice cold taco shells with ice cold tuna salad in the shells, next to some ice cold noodles that were so cold they had no taste. Obviously everything was pre-made and sitting in a tub in a refrigerator. I've never seen a tuna taco served cold with chunk tuna and mayo (like in a sandwich) stuffed in the taco shell. No garnish on the plate. And they charged $11. I have no idea how anyone running a restaurant could think this was a) attractive; or b) edible. My friend had the \"Cobb\" Salad. one chunk of avacado,no olives, a couple of pieces of chicken over iceberg lettuce. Also  $11."}
{"text":"I have never come here during the busy lunch hours - happy hour is my time of day. I always come with co-workers because it is the only bar area in the Oxford Centre that we can go to (we work at the other). We come maybe once or twice a month. 
Their food is okay. I usually eat the nachos or spinach-artichoke dip. Both are delicious and filling for the price. Their wine selection is terrible, so I end up drinking something on draft (whatever the special is).
This place isn't terrible for the occasional downtime after work, but if it disappeared, I wouldn't miss it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to grab a bite to eat and socialize with family, friends, or work colleagues."}
{"text":"Eaten here twice now.  First time had the beef and cheddar, the second time I had the Sante Fe Burger.

The Beef and Cheddar was very large, but nothing stood out about it.  The horseradish sauce was weak.  I like it with a little kick...actually the bigger the kick the better.

The Sante Fe Burger (I believe that's the name)  Came with nacho cheese, blue tortillas, and green chilies on it.  The burger was cooked perfectly, but nothing stood out in regards to the flavor of the meat or toppings.  And I love green chilies in tacos, burgers, and white chili.

I had fries both times.  The fries are taste, but extremely soggy...you feel like you're eating oil the entire time."}
{"text":"I recently got to hit up Easy Street on my trip back to Pittsburgh to visit the fam. I was particularly excited to try their new menu since I\"m a HUGE fan of Easy Street and lunch dates DT. The Italian Turkey Club was filling, light and super fresh! Perfect for lunchtime cravings. Matt chowed down on the Pittsburgh Steak Sandwich, which was killer! Service was prompt and friendly. Our server continuously refilled our drinks and informed of us an awesome Happy Hour that we will need to check out. Half off apps from 4:30-6:30pm. Also, noted 8\" pizza is available now from 4-close now!  If you arrive during Happy Hour, it's just $5! We will be back."}
{"text":"Again, another place in the rotation of places to eat during lunch while downtown. Atmosphere is a bar friendly environment with plenty of TVs to watch any sporting event. Patio is nice in warmer months. 

Service and Staff is usually ok for the most part. Depending on when you go, if it is extremely busy you have to take that into consideration. 

The food at Easy St is good, but nothing to blow you away. Prices are average to high depending on what you get. I've tried almost everything but got the Baby Spinach Salad with Chicken for lunch today. The portion was overly filling with the addition of blue cheese crumbles, red onion, and red peppers. Usually I get balsamic dressing but opted to try the honey wasabi. It was a hybrid of honey mustard with a wasabi kick. Interesting but good fit for the salad. 

Most of the time you can get in and out in under and hour, but if you are in a rush, get it for take out."}
{"text":"Threw a surprise party for my mom's 60th. Service was great, food was great, venue is great. Laura Vetere from Easy Street was our point person for the event planning and was really helpful throughout. Night couldn't have been better. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"I always go to their pizza place/take out counter for lunch. The food is great but they are really slow with getting your food out. I feel like there is a major miscommunication with the young lady working the register and the man making the food. Be prepared to wait your entire lunch break for your order to be ready."}
{"text":"This review is for their express (open for lunch). Eric the chef is the person that holds this all together.  He knows all the regulars and their special orders.  Sometimes you can see him start the persons order before they even place it.  For downtown quick lunch this is one of the best options in Pittsburgh.  Large slices of pizza or pepperoni rolls for $3. It doesn't matter what type of pizza you get its all good.  Occasionally he switches the pepperoni roll to a steak roll.  If you see that buy it.  You will not be disappointed.  I try to go their every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Easy Street, but I can never say that I'm impressed by them, yet I would not say it's a *bad* place either.   I suppose it's hard because the part of downtown that it sits in is rather bereft of really impressive options when you're looking for a sit-down restaurant.  I've been here several time with co-workers, mostly for lunch and once for happy hour after work. The food and beverages are just rather pedestrian.  Burgers, wraps, salads...all fine, nothing special. Well, maybe the salmon salad stands out, and one of my co-workers orders the buffalo chicken wrap.every.single.time.  I've never had bad service here, but not had anyone who has blown me away, either.  Let me put it this way: when someone suggests it, I don't pass, but I would not suggest it if it was up to me.  There are more interesting options closer to the central business district."}
{"text":"Not only is this place disgusting when it comes to the taste and variety of food but its overpriced and the service absolutely sucks. I chose to come here with a few friends after work for some appetizers and drinks... it took the server over 15 minutes to even notice us. We ordered finally, everything at once because we weren't sure when they would be over next. luckily the drinks came in a timely manner, as did the food but that's what tops it all as to why this place is horrible. the food was REPULSIVE. the quesadilla was soggy, the cheese tasted almost moldy and swear I found a bug AND a hair in my food. I couldn't have been more disappointed. I left and i highly recommend everyone to do the same. you will not only be disappointed but you'll probably get sick."}
{"text":"this is regarding the pizza shop in Oxford Centre affiliated with Easy Street.. At least I'm assuming so since my credit card receipt had easy streets name and phone number. 

Anyways I waited a good 20 minutes in line. There seemed to be 2 workers.. But in between taking orders the counter girl would stop to help cook which made the wait entirely too long. (Only 5 people in front of me and stood there 20min) 

Finally its my turn and i asked what slices they had available and she said only BBQ chicken. I asked if any others were being made and she said no. It's 12:20 and no one thought to make another pepperoni or cheese pizza for slices??? My slice was huge and average but bad planning on their part. I didn't want BBQ but felt compelled to order after standing there 20min.

 Hot mess"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch and happy hour a few times. Everytime I've gone, I've enjoyed myself. For happy hour there's a mixed crowd which is nice for Pittsburgh. You have groups in their 20's, 30's, and 40's. It's great when it's warm outside b/c then there's more room b/c it can get fairly crowded after work for happy hour. 

Lunch has always been surprisingly good at this place. I'm not sure why I have low expectations for these type of places, but I guess I thought they would only be good at bar food (which they are) but they have excellent salads. I'm not even a salad person and I LOVE their salads. I usually get the grilled salmon salad which has been awesome, but I have friends who have gotten the steak salad and the chicken and strawberry salads and have had equally positive experiences. 

I definitely recommend checking this place out for drinks or food."}
{"text":"For a lunch spot, this place is always a great place to go. We have been here a few times. In the warmer months they have the outside patio open. The service we have had over the years has been pretty consistent. The servers are nice and on top of things, the food comes out timely. The wait on busy days is never too long. Photos of some food will be added."}
{"text":"It's a bar and restaurant in the basement of Oxford Center, the big octagonal skyscraper on Grant and Blvd of the Allies.

Decent happy hour specials, pizza, veggie wraps, and a great selection of beer for Downtown; nonsmoking.  Middle-tier restaurant; not a quick lunch place, but a sit down place where the food will be a bit better, but cost a bit more.  

If I'm drinking with coworkers after work, this is where we usually wind up."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials, bartenders and management very friendly. Food and drinks are good as well. Fast service and great location."}
{"text":"Huge (grilled) chicken strawberry  salad ($8.99), served with a bread stick. Loaded with feta cheese (we subbed gargonzola, n/c), tomatoes, ripe, sliced strawberries,  a delicious spring mix, abundant strips of grilled, juicy chicken, etc. Unsure  what dressing  was, but it was good. I ate a lot, but still took about 1/3 home. Female bartender and barback were friendly and efficient. We were there at noon, and it was busy, but crowd thinned slightly about 12:45.
One tip: for some reason, if you sit at the bar like we did, you can't get the carmel chicken salad. Only available in dining room, which I'll order next time."}
{"text":"Well as I noted they changed the menu along with the prices. Some of the items remained intact but other things were swapped out.

For instance you can no longer get pizza until after 4:00. That had been a good take home meal for family. Most items are ala carte but if you order a sandwich you can pair it with chips, fries, or cole slaw. They do have a portabello mushroom sandwich which I will try next time the occasion merits it.

They do offer now a nice spinach salad with toppings and you can add chicken for a slight up charge. Again, this is not a place I normally visit except when I am meeting someone for lunch.

Service can be slow at times.Yesterday we had to wait 15 minutes for our lunch and my girlfriend had to be back at work!  I think their Wi Fi has gotten worse so I normally turn it off to get reception."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food.  Better than most bar atmosphere's because of large glass doors that open out to patio.  Wait staff was fast and friendly."}
