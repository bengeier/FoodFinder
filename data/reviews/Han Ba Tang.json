{"text":"I liked their version of a charcuterie board because it had katsu (fried pork cutlet) and shrimp tempura. 

I tried the soju flight and it was interesting. The flavours were strawberry, cucumbers and ginseng. 

The sweet potato fries and chicken wings were one of my favourites."}
{"text":"Great fusion Korean. One of the best I've ever had. Works for both native Koreans and Canadians. The kimchi fries were excellent, the tacos were superb, and the service was perfect. We received a couple of dishes on the house which was a pleasant surprise. Definitely will be there again and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times were enjoyable. Nice environment, great music. Drinks are reasonably priced. Food on the other hand.. slightly bigger portions would nice especially for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went in the other night for some food and drinks. It was his first time,  my second. Both times I have been there three food and service were excellent.  The kimchi fries with bulgogi are out of this world as are the lobster tacos and the kalbi tacos. The sangria is delicious and their soju is fantastic,  especially the apple cinnamon!   Great atmosphere,  friendly service and great food.  Does it get any better? 
Date night or girls night out,  this is one of those wonderful hidden gems."}
{"text":"really enjoyed the food from Han Ba Tang...
Spicy pork taco and spoon pizza are a must try for this restaurant.

For those with a group larger than four, i suggest you make a reservation.  I was there on Sunday night, during my seating, they at least turn away three big groups."}
{"text":"Solid place. 

3 pork tacos for $8. Good value. Also had chicken wings which were decently fried. Fair price for a pitcher of beer too. Good place for groups because of large tables. 

Great service. Waiter was attentive and courteous.  

Nice open atmosphere. A little strange in that it's a Mexican Korean fusion but it's bright, clean, airy."}
{"text":"just came for drinks. very hip with excellent service."}
{"text":"Came in around 4pm on a Friday and my friend and I were 2 of 4 people in the entire restaurant which was a nice surprise since most reviews I've read say this place is always packed.
We ordered the sweet potato chips with powdered butter seasoning (put that seasoning in jars and I'd come in and buy that by the case). 
We ordered two of each different taco and ban mi sandwich on the menu and they were all great. Only thing I was unsure of was if they were supposed to be a bit on the colder side or not because the pulled pork on my tacos was hardly even room temperature.
Other than that it was a good experience and I'm coming back for those chips and kim chi fries."}
{"text":"Just when you thought the Yonge and Sheppard area in North York already had enough Korean restaurants, along comes another. Except Han Ba Tang is a breath of fresh air. 

For starters, they have one of the best korean bars. House infused sojus that can be ordered in a flight (4 generous glasses in a flight for $15) or in their cocktails. I loved the cucumber and apple cinnamon sojus the most! The Live to 1000 cocktail (henessy + ginseng + honey) was also a delicious hard hitter.

The Spicy Pork tacos here are probably the best thing on the menu, followed closely by the Kimchi and Bulgogi fries. Yes, KIMCHI AND BULGOGI ON CRISPY FRIES. Sorry Banh Mi Boys, you've been ousted as the king of kimchi fries.

The spoon pizza (mashed sweet potato \"crust\" with vegetables, tomato sauce, topped with cheese and bacon or kimchi) is a great dish to share when drinking - it is literally carbs on carbs topped with a GINORMOUS layer of melted cheese. Can't really ask for more.

Pro Tip: If you end up ordering the Spicy Seafood soup and have left overs, take it home and cook ramen with it. The soup is so flavourful with all the good seafood it's stewed with. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"New restaurant near sheppard yonge. Love the deco style. Eating by the window, great view! Ordered Han Sang Set Kalbi. The beef tastes good and fresh but not a large portion. Anyway, i m glad i got a bew place to eat. Price is quite reasonable n they provide 20% off coupon recently."}
{"text":"I ate here last night for the second time and it was just as good as the first time. Firstly, it's so great to have a \"hip\" restaurant in the area - gives you the Queen st vibe without having to drive there.  The food is delicious and the servers are super nice. Service is just a bit slower than I'm normally used to but I'm not counting that as a negative point. Overall great environment and delicious food. Can't wait to go again and try the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss depending on when you go. 

The first 3 times I went, the food was delicious and on point.  I told everyone I know to go and try it, but won't do that any more. 

The last time I went, I was really disappointed. I always get the kimchi tofu cake. This time the steam pork belly was hard and tough. They didn't give you as much pork belly as the last three times I ordered it. 

Ordered Kalbi, pulled pork and chicken tacos like I always do. And this time, there was just something off about the taste. 

Next was the spicy seafood soup with noodles. The seafood was all shrivelled  and tough to eat.  

I'm giving this place 3 stars bc it's not consistent. You don't know if you're going to get a good meal or a bad one."}
{"text":"-Kalbi taco is delicious; meat is tender and well marinated.
-seafood soup is spicy and well seasoned.  Although it's on the expensive side when compared to ones served in Nakwon and Kachi.
-spoon pizza is meh to me.  Tastes like cheese on top of mashed sweet potato with pasta sauce, which is basically what it is. The combination of these ingredients just didn't do anything for my taste buds.
-kimchi fries is not bad, though the fries tasted like the frozen McCain fries to me."}
{"text":"For full disclosure, I joined my friend for a special event where local food bloggers were invited to try the new menu. 
Some of the items consumed were the Raman noodle salad, mushroom/vegetarian taco, (smoked?) mackerel, pork belly, mackerel fried rice, cold vermicelli noodles with pork skewer and a very delicious shaved ice/red bean/cornflake dessert. 
I'm not a huge fan of Korean food generally, but the items were pretty tasty, especially the taco and dessert. The addition of things like crushed corn chips in the taco and cornflakes in the shaved ice dessert were simple things that brought the food to the next (albeit slightly hipster) level. 
The service was really great, attentive and friendly. Not sure how much that was influenced by the fact that we were there for a special event, but a welcome change from some of the terrible service I've been receiving recently! The owner/manager was lovely, chatty and quite endearing. 
I live in the downtown core, but often visit friends living uptown. I'll definitely suggest this spot as a possible dinner/drinks location in the future."}
{"text":"We went for dinner today with a group of 20+ people! The staff were very accommodating of our large group and it was particularly appreciated because we had a lot of kids with us. It was our first time and our waitress was patient, friendly and helpful with suggesting menu items. 

Standout dishes were the tacos!! We ordered the chilli shrimp and spicy pork tacos, and they were delicious!! Healthy portions and great flavour! Another notable item was the creamy rice cakes and pickled cabbage - the sweet and sour cabbage was such a nice addition and contrast to the cream sauce. 

Will definitely return! Thank you Han Ba Tang staff!"}
{"text":"Would not come back. There is way better Korean places around. Drove here to be disappointed by the low quality of the food. Decoration is cool though but nothing amazing."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening around 8:30 PM and the restaurant was pretty filled up. Grabbed a seat by the bar and ordered, kimchi fries (added bulgogi on), spoon pizza, and Kalbi tacos! While the portions are not huge, they do keep you filled for awhile. Also ordered one flavoured soju (pineapple flavor) and it was definately something worth trying if you haven't. Overall, friendly service and \"ok\" food!"}
{"text":"My usual go-to for any occasion. Its usually packed to the max on weekends so it gets exciting with good ambiance. I love the decor and hipster feel of the place. I've been going there pretty often so I get along with the servers/managers/owners/etc, who are all very nice and friendly. The food is good, especially the pork tacos, spicy king prawn, and kimchi fries with bulgogi. I wish they had more on-tap-beer choices, but meh, I always end up ordering makkoli/soju/sprite anyway. Its honestly one of the only decent bars to go to around yonge and finch/sheppard area."}
{"text":"Service was pretty crappy overall and ruined the experience for us. Place was smaller than I thought too, somehow I expected something grander. Food was average or slightly lower really for Korean food for sure."}
{"text":"Great Korean-Mexican fusion restaurant. You have to try Kimchi fries and Spoon pizza! So yummy!"}
{"text":"After seeing a lot of good reviews about this hip Korean Fusion place in North York, my friend and I decided to give HBT a try. The retro Korean movie posters on the exposed red brick walls gave off a modern and hip vibe, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere.

When I first saw the cocktail menu, I was particularly intrigued by the item titled 'Live to 1000' which comprised of ginseng, soju, honey, and hennessy. Though the menu stated ginseng as an ingredient of the beverage I did not expect an actual piece of ginseng to be on top of the cocktail. The taste of the ginseng did not ruin the flavour of the alcohol however as the honey made it quite sweet in fact.

Their kalbi and chicken breast tacos brought an asian flavour in a mexican package with traditional asian ingredients of beef, chicken, spring onion wrapped in tacos with melted cheese. Kimchi fries is very popular nowadays and puts kimchi and bulgogi on top of gravy and Japanese mayo covered fries. The end result is a sweet and sour snack that is both delicious and filling. The kimchi fries here are no different here and are not particularly special compared to those made in other fusion restaurants.

Lastly, the spicy chicken with cheese fondue was a mixture of Korean rice cakes and spicy bbq chicken paired with a candle-heated bowl of fondue. The cheese offered was not nearly flavourful enough to combine with the already strong flavour of the spicy chicken. This made the fondue feel like a gimmick."}
{"text":"- Food quality was ok but overpriced. Portions were small. 
     -$18 for what I would consider to be a small plate of kimichi fries. The principle ingredient is cut potatoes. You couldn't spare more cut potatoes?!
     -$22 for the cutlet plate. I could have had two of these and not been full.
- Little effort put into menus; printed on regular paper.
- Area seemed understaffed. However, server really put in an effort.

Overall, I would not recommend this dining experience. I left feeling like I had grossly overpaid for a modicum of medium quality food. There are places you can have a much better dining experience at equivalent expense."}
{"text":"Great for a casual evening out with friends. Pub-like atmosphere - expect it to be loud. Make a reservation if possible.

My favourites:
- Beef Kalbijim
- Bulgogi kimchi poutine
- chicken wings
- any of the soju drinks"}
{"text":"Stopped by here Saturday evening with a friend. On that note, make sure to make a reservation beforehand as we waited 45 minutes before sitting down (nothing wrong with that at all).

Ended up having the kimchi fries with bulgogi, lobster tacos and shared the cutlet platter. All were pretty solid, kimchi fries were unique and the lobster tacos were tasty. Platter wasn't anything special but it hit the spot. 

Took a while for the food to come but the music and environment were solid."}
{"text":"Aw man, food has kind of gone downhill since this place starting picking up more hype. 
The fries here used to be so good... Compare the fries from earlier this year (when they first opened)- to the fries I was served tonight. It seems that they've gotten lazy with the preparation of the food; from the batter, the cuts of the potato, as well as portion size has changed for the worse. While the current menu introduced some new additions, it's disappointing to see that they're totally riding the success wagon. Portions sizes still remain the same (actually, have gotten even smaller) since their abrupt price inflation. 
Service is alright. Gets crazy packed on weekends, so make reservations or leave your name down early."}
{"text":"Went there expecting decent food and decent ambience. We got great food and amazing ambience. The service was amazing!  We ordered a bottle of California Chardonnay that was reasonably priced and when we wanted to order a second bottle they ran out. They gave us a bottle of a much more expensive wine for the same price. The shrimp taco was amazing! So were the honey garlic wings."}
{"text":"Great new spot just North of Sheppard. Been to many Korean restaurants that have the same feel and don't feel too upscale and a lot of times a dive. This place looks like they've taken the time to creating a welcoming atmosphere, their staff is friendly and always asking how they could make your experience better, and the menu is affordable, unique, and most importantly delicious!"}
{"text":"First time at this place. I happened to be walking by and said \"what the hay...\" 

Decor is definitely hipster with majority of the crowd being young. 

Food was great since I've ordered the 'Taco Sampler' which means literally just an appetizer.

It's pretty costly if you are looking for a place to only eat which you are probably looking to spend $25 without drinks to satisfy your appetite. 

Service was good up until we ordered since we didn't order any drinks so we were pretty much ignored and the time to serve our food took 35 minutes. 

They only received the 3 star rating from me is because I knew I would receive the kind of service that I did since we didn't order any drinks. It's business practice for these smaller spots but hey, the number of tables was not unbearable so no excuses there."}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails, cool decor and good food. Perfect if you're into Korean style tapas. You must try the Beef short rib and their kimchi fries. Also recommend the cucumber soju gin n tonic."}
{"text":"Worst unexpected customer service experience. Used to like coming here. Servers seem interrelated and were very friendly and chilled. 

Today, literally just now, near last call, we went in and was seated with a non-plated table since we ain't eating. We decided to move over to the next table since we were assigned to the corner table that was gloomy.

I asked the server nicely if we could move, being me and kinda Canadian and all. He asked why with a big surprise. Gave us a smirk. Started the move. 

I thought it was cool even his exaggerated \"why\" seemed a little impolite. He cleaned the table we moved to with the loudest clinking and clacking you would ever hear from a passive aggressor. The plates and utensils cannot hit each other any louder, and his facial and body language tells us all. 

That ended it for me. This server I never had before nor seen before has ended my relationship here. I don't know if management has changed since I don't see the familiar faces. But I am no longer willing to come back to get to the bottom of this. Good luck.

My first review. Never thought I would end up here giving my two cents. Sadly, it happened."}
{"text":"I ventured out here from downtown to check it out after hearing all the good reviews from friends and online.
It was okay...first, they lost the reservation I made over the phone but eventually found us a table. 
My favourite dish was the spicy prawns. They were really really good, possibly the best I've had.  Everything else was just okay, but pretty good for what we paid.  The dishes here are very very reasonably priced, and have good portion sizes.  If I lived around here, I'd probably go back again. 
The tacos and spoon pizza were not that appetizing.  The tacos were very bland.  
The soju cocktails were yummy!"}
{"text":"First time trying Korean fusion after a good friend recommended this restaurant for a get together.  We arrived early in the evening so had to pay for parking behind the building.  Had the honor to sit right in the center where high seats and table awaited us; a party of 8.  Everyone were mad excited and super hungry so we ordered all the most of the tappas and had pitchers of Sapporo to pair the dishes.

Service: 9/10
Food: 7/10
Value: 7/10

Like: panoramic window at the front.  Fast and friendly service. Nice ambiance for rowdy crowds. 

Dislike: pay parking. Can get smokey inside if patrons are smoking out in the front.

A must try if you like Korean fusion."}
{"text":"This place is cute and trendy, located in North York right near the Sheppard subway stop.

Food is tasty and reasonably priced. We had the Kimchi poutine, Kalbi tacos and Spicy Chilli Chicken with cheese fondue. All were delish although the tacos yum but small. This place also has some great drinks and delicious soju that I believe they make in house. I had the Sona Colada and Clean Cut (cucumber soju). Again, both really tasty!"}
{"text":"BAD SERVICE!!
I work in the area, so a good group of coworkers and friends have frequented this spot since they opened.  The food is decent, and they play good music.  I think they are under new management, because the service has just gotten SO BAD it is totally not worth going back!
We made a reservation for about 15 people a week in advance, and once we arrived (5pm on a Thursday) they told us there was a 3 hour limit for every table - which wouldn't have been so bad if they told us when we made the reservation, or didn't mention it while the restaurant was still completely empty.  
The waitress took half the table's food order, and walked away.  We had to flag her back throughout the whole night to order more food/drinks.  Around 2.5 hours in, another server threw our \"separated\" bills at each person reminding us of the 3 hour limit.  By \"separated\" they randomly split the full table's orders into bills that didn't even make sense, and looked annoyed when we asked them to split it properly - which they should've asked us to begin with, rather than trying to rush us out.  
To top it all off, I combined mine and my husband's bill and the waitress did the math on her phone, and added an extra $2 to the debit machine hoping I wouldn't notice!  
They successfully got us out within the 3 hour limit and the best part about this was there was 
NO ONE waiting to take our table!  
Very, very disappointed.. We used to enjoy and promote HanBaTang, but the service alone has turned us all away..."}
{"text":"I've been to this place for a few times.  First time when they just opened and offering $5/pint special, last being last night.  One major thing that has changed is the price point as it has inflated quite considerably.  Food wise, I've tried their taco, spicy pork and kimchi fries my friend was raving about.  I have to say my favour is spicy pork as I believe they use belly which was quite yummy, taco... Way too small and I prefer more kick in the sauce.  As for the fries, some are golden crisp and some not, just ok but not worth the price point.  The ambiance here is nice and it's not crowded in a way I will bump into people, which is good.  It's really a place for drink and hanging out with friends. I definitely won't come here just for the food alone.

The service overall is friendly, it's obvious that some servers are more friendly than the others.  I guess they don't designated server to selected tables so I can always spot miscommunication here and there like sending wrong order to the table etc.  The place is always packed in the weekend so either come early or make reservation I guess, and there are times when we couldn't get a table and we left.

Overall is not a bad place for drinks with friends.   I think the location is the biggest reason for me to come back because it's right by Shepard subway line.  But I wouldn't come here for a date during dinner time."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday for dinner with a group of my friends. I came in a bit later than my friends and they were able to seat my friends even though not everyone in the party was there. I had a bit of trouble identifying the restaurant as the sign outside was illegible, once inside however the sign was clearly displayed. For a Monday, although the restaurant wasn't packed it had a bit of a crowd. The decor of the restaurant was vintage industrial and the atmosphere was quite nice.

I ordered the creamy rice cake, kalbi tacos and the Sona Pinada. My friends each ordered their own three tacos and I got to try their tacos. 

The tacos were good but weren't amazing. The tortilla were cold, had the tortilla been warm I probably would have liked it more. The chilli shrimp taste sort of like coconut shrimp and although good was unimpressive. The spicy pork taco was my favourite one, it was flavourful and it had a bit of heat to it which made it all the better. The kalbi taco was flavourful but the beef was a bit dry. The creamy rice cake was really interesting. It was l like eating Alfredo pasta but it was with rice cake instead, the portion was quite big and really filling for the price. Everything was quite affordable. I got to try a bit of my friend's spoon pizza, the concept was fun but it basically taste mostly of cheese. 

I would recommend the place for drinks and the atmosphere as for the food I would say it was average at best considering the tortillas were still cold."}
{"text":"Great food and good drink selection .  What more can you ask for? Okay, maybe an extra server would be nice"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. This is my 5th time here. Is definitely my go to place when I have friends over. Everything is a great spin on favourites. Wings are delicious, as is the pork steamed bun, and bulgogi. 
Drinks are amazing

Wait time during the weekend. But it's worth it. I promise."}
{"text":"HBT. I've been here a few times with a group of friends for late night eats and dinner. The atmosphere is very rustic. Every time I went, there was usually wait time of 30mins. 

The concept is fusion. The kimchi fries and kalbi/unagi tacos are a must have! The prices are reasonable but on the higher end of reasonable. The Soju flights are something to try. Basically they infuse either ginseng, cucumber, lemon, (theres more) into the soju. 
 
HBT would be a place I would recommend friends to try out. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that it could be less expensive."}
{"text":"I remember used to come to this place when it wasn't as busy. But oh man. It's getting too popular. Went yesterday around 5pm (early), and the restaurant is already packed. Got the last table available ...phew...

As soon as you walk you, you will get the homey atmosphere. The staffs here are really friendly, especially the owner. She hugs my bf every time we go... Lol...

Food was decent. Really like the kimchi fries and pork taco. Wouldn't recommend the lobster salad.

One last thing, my jacket and hair always smell like old oil coming out the restaurant. Need to dress down before going in next time."}
{"text":"Really cool place in North York with good service. Great modern day take on Korean Food.  Kimchi fries are a MUST. The soju drinks are a bit pricey, tho."}
{"text":"Kimchi fries are awesome and you can't beat the lobster tacos. It's so affordable and a variety to choose from."}
{"text":"Visited here on a Friday night with friends. This place had a hipster korean fusion feel complete with wooden decor and mason jars as mugs. The food here was ok, nothing too memorable. Service was friendly. A lot of people raved about the spoon pizza but I didn't think it was anything special. Tasted literally like mashed potato topped with tomato sauce/cheese. We also tried some tacos, Kim chi fries and bulgogi on noodles, which were all not bad but nothing special. Still an ok place to meet up with friends over some food and drinks."}
{"text":"I love visiting new places. This Asian fusion joint is great for hanging out and enjoy girls night out. Music is lit and they have amazing food. Something that is not traditional. Kimchi Fries is must have !!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere (unlike other korean bars and restaurants)! It's very energetic and fun to go for drinks on the weekends.

Not only is HBT a great place to go for drinks, the food is great as well.

Kalbi Tacos
The first thing we noticed with the tacos was the size. A lot of other taco places we've been to have on average smaller shells, which means ordering more to get full. At HBT, you can get 3 Kalbi tacos for $11 and with a few other side dishes, you will be pretty satisfied.

Crispy Chili Shrimp Tacos
It is no wonder the shrimp tacos are one of HBT top sellers. It's seasoned very well, and not too spicy but enough kick to give the tacos flavour.

Spicy BBQ chicken ($9.00) with cheese fondue ($3.00)   
You can order the chicken dish on its own or add the cheese fondue with it. If you've already ordered a couple of cheese dishes, you may want to hold off on ordering the fondue as the chicken dish itself has enough flavour on its own.

Spoon Pizza ($9.00) 
We absolutely loved the concept of the spoon pizza which is a fairly popular trend in Korea. For those that may be a little bit carb sensitive, this option is perfect as it's made with a mashed sweet potato base and the rest of what makes pizza so great - cheese!

Jjambbong Ramyun
Served in a traditional brass soup pot, it doesn't get any better than this! Jjambbong is a popular Chinese style Korean spicy seafood noodle soup, but in this case, served with ramyun instead of traditional thicker noodles. There is a generous amount of seafood in this dish including shrimps and mussels as well as vegetables. This would be a perfect dish to have while you're drinking or on its own if you love spicy noodle soups. 

Next time you're looking for a new spot to try, visit Han Ba Tang. Their unusual Korean fusion menu, decor and friendly service will make you a regular there in no time."}
{"text":"Decided to check out the new Korean izakaya on a Thursday night. Restaurant was about half full around 8pm since we were there for late dinner.

Ordered spicy chicken with cheese fondue, creamy rice cakes and spoon pizza. Server was slow to understand what I was saying.. I could already sense the dumbness and this meal was heading in the wrong direction.

Got our spicy chicken dish without cheese fondue and the ricecakes first. Asked about the cheese fondue where they went back into the kitchen without any response. Waited another 5 minutes for the stupid cheese fondue to come while our food got cold. Which is unfortunate cause the cheese fondue was really disgusting- we didn't even finish it. Ricecakes with carbonara sauce was mediocre, very bland and the ricecakes were over cooked. The spoon pizza didn't come until we finished our first 2 dishes. Another server comes over and asks us if we received it? Huh? What a stupid question.. As a server you should know? Irritated to the max, I asked him if the order went in and than the server goes on to tell me that they burnt the pizza in the kitchen. IF THE PIZZA GOT BURNT IN THE KITCHEN, WHY ARE YOU ASKING US IF WE RECEIVED IT!? I just don't understand.. I told the server we don't want it anymore so he cancelled it out of our order and than gave us 20% discount on the food we ate.

Honestly I know they are still a new restaurant that only opened 2 months ago but the service was unacceptable. There are some people who shouldn't work in service industry and the first server that dealt with our table was the perfect example (yup, I am talking about you the short asian girl with circle lens). I can put up with dumb servers if the food was amazing but it was just mediocre. 

I left very dissatisfied with everything about this restaurant which I find to be quite unfortunate because the atmosphere was pretty nice. Oh wells, maybe people should know better than to open restaurants with mediocre food and dumb servers."}
{"text":"My favourite Korean restaurant especially when drinking"}
{"text":"The décor was cute and trendy, the service was great - waiters made sure we had what we need and checked up on us. However the food was not so amazing.

It was very hyped up through the reviews, I was really looking forward to the food but it did not live up to my expectations. I guess you can say that this restaurant is a mixture of Korean and Latin influence. It was pricey for the food quality, flavours were very bland as a matter of fact, the stew I had did not have very much flavours. My friend and I also tried the rice cake with Alfredo sauce on it, it seemed as though they got a store bought sauce and poured it on the rice cakes. First few bites were okay, after a while my taste buds just got bored.

I would not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Tasty food. 

But.. bit pricy for the portion. 

The cheese rice cake was so tasty.
And spicy seafood soup was good, too.

The staff is polite and nice.

This place is tiny so we got a small table which is uncomfortable to enjoy our food.

Anyways, this is a nice little place. 
Good Korean fusion food with great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm not a pro when it comes to korean style cuisines but this place is not at the top of my list of korean places to visit. 

Located just north of Sheppard on Yonge, surrounded by Nome Izakaya, Joons, Frog and the FIrkin and Boston Pizza, you have a hipster-ish style place. There was not really a big sign to really distinguish it's plot but it's popular enough to know it's there. Once you walk in to the restaurant you get a really cool rustic, war chamber like feel. With antique wall hangers and handles, wooden wall panels and metal panel ceiling, you definitely feel you're in the hipster category of places to eat. The place has old-school marquee signs as a wall display with old mid 20th century posters on the wall.

The staff were friendly but a bit all over the place. The hostess was my server and bus-girl and bartender. They were quick to seat me even though they were busy. Must have been my lucky day. 

The menu was 3 pieces of printed paper in a school clip-folder that was falling a part and stained. I feel they could do better with that at least. The selections were great but a bit confusing. I feel the choices were a mix of mexican and korean. I ordered the following:

- Kalbi Tacos - $5 for single of $12 for 3. Literally kalbi beef slices in a taco shell. It came soggy and was falling apart. Had to fork it after the first attempt.

- Kimchi Fries w/ Bulgogi - i think $13. This was great. It was literally was fries with kimchi, bulgogi meat (extra) and some cream sauce similar to sour cream.

- Spicy Seafood Stew aka Jampong - $10 for small bowl enough for 2 people. It was very spicy and hearty. Lots of fresh seafood such as crab legs, mussels, cuttlefish and shrimp. Suggetion, order it with the ramen or purple rice (extra $2 for either).

The above three items were just enough for 2 people. 

Overall, it was a satisfying adventure. I would give it 3 out of 5. For korean, i've definitely been to better. But for the convenience and to chill with friends, definitely a great place to hang."}
{"text":"Came on a weekend around 6pm and the place looked cute and cozy and I thought the chairs looked really neat. Its a bar/restaurant close to yonge and finch and I have been wanting to try this place out for awhile from seeing it on instagram for group dinners and get togethers. Its a great social place and a great place for a casual date as the atmosphere isnt overly noisy. I got some of the flavoured soju shots and agreed with a friend that the pineapple won out of the other flavours. We also ordered unagi tacos, kimchi fries and spicy chicken and cheese all to share. Everything was delicious and flavourful but very filling. Not the best kimchi fries Ive had but not bad. Best kimchi fries goes out to Banh Mi Boys! The spicy chicken and cheese came out on a heated hot plate with a ring around it containing cheese and corn. I loved it and would love to eat it again if Im in the area. I totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I've been back many times since and I have to say that I'm addicted to the chicken wings. SOOOOOOOO GOOD!"}
{"text":"I've visit Han Ba Tang many times but the last time was march 28th, it will be my very last visit , will never go back again! 
I planed a birthday dinner for my girl, we were thinking of Nome first but I was like let's try Han Ba Tang (my Frds never been) good place to take pics and chill, so I called in to make a reservation for 5 on Monday night , a guy picked up the phone and answered , he sounds very impatient, I have to repeat what time , how many ppl for at least 3 times . We got there on time the next day, it was very slow , they put us at the very back corner , unset, darker, very quite corner . I request to move to the table at the front by the window , the waitresses are looking at one guy by the bar ( I assume he is the manager) and asking if that's oka ? he looked at me for a sec and said NO, I asked why ? He said there is a reservation for that table . But guess what , from 9:30 until they close , no one came in to sit by that table . I could tell this guy at the bar is the one who picked up the phone , just by his lousy attitude!!!
For the food , 1st we order a lot of food and drinks , but we've been told they don't serve their cheese hotspot after 8:30, which we find it's very stupid and funny ! That was one of the reason we chose to eat at HBT. 2nd we wanna order kimchi fries , we've been told they run out of fries . Lol which bar will ever run out of fries ? 3rd we ordered sweet potatoes chips , the amount of the chip is like half bag of chip that cost $1.50, but they charge $6 .
After we left , all 5 of us said at the same time : I will never come back to this place .
To whom it May concerned : I was working in this industry for over 7years , ur managers attitude is the worst I've ever seen, food are just ok but nothing special . 
Btw, the waitresses services are great."}
{"text":"Definitely get the cheese chicken and octopus/pork belly. Would come to recommend these. They have daily deals on alcohol - fri/sat was $8 for 1+1 oz (2 shots) of either grey goose or Jameson, $6 for jack Daniel or crown or $12 for Hennessy. 

Bit on the pricier end and gets pretty rowdy here. Pretty dim here but have fun vibes. The past couple times I've been here, they had pretty cute waitresses around too! 

Food would only be average and the portion sizes are fairly small. Great to come for drinks afterwork or to chill with friends."}
{"text":"My feedback: know exactly what you're ordering when you come here. I came on a Friday night with two friends. Certain dishes are pricy for a stingier portion. However there are also certain dishes that are very good and worth the price (it's somewhat pricier than average at this place for food, but ok-reasonable for drinks like beers). We ordered a pitcher of Rickard's Red on top of: 

Kimchi fries: the small for $10 was good for the 3 of us, and tasted great. This was the one dish we would get again next time.

Bossam: this was not bad. However you get like 11-12 slices of bossam (slices of broiled pork belly). Although this tasted good we didn't think it was worth it. Like roughly $17 or 18 if I recall correctly.

Kalbijjim: sorry this was pretty lame. The place gave us like 3-4 pieces of kalbijjim and the dish cost 18 bucks. It also didn't taste good, only dry and overcooked.

Overall, some food is good. Drinks are okay. Selection is not bad. Environment is pretty cool and good for a night with friends. Service is alright. If we do consider coming next time I think we'll focus on the drinks and particular food based on the pictures on Yelp. By the way, the place lost a star from me because we didn't appreciate that the waiter told us there was a reservation coming up when we were about to order a second round of drinks. Waiter should have asked if we were still going to order first before assuming we were the best table to kick out next."}
{"text":"So I may not be the best person the review this place since I'm not a lover of the kind of food they serve. 
We went with a few friends and I found the food to be an Asian Gastropub fusion. Most food items were very heavy, creamy and cheezy. I found myself wishing they had stuff to the fresh flavours that are so unique to Asian cuisine. Also the place was too loud and I could barley hear my friend sitting next to me. 

Good place the try once but I don't see myself going back soon."}
{"text":"Was here the past Friday at about 9pm. The place gets really busy. It was just a friend and I so it was easy to just take a seat at the bar. The bars have hooks underneath so that you can hang your coats and bags which is something I think every bar needs. They also play top 40 music. The service was quick and friendly. 

We had a beer, two bottles of soju (regular and grapefruit), cocktails we had the peach beach and a clean cut. They also have shot specials, I believe it was buy one get one free which is great for those drunks that like to buy rounds of shots. :-) 

I liked the grapefruit soju the most. The cocktails were only okay, but I think if you enjoy sweet drinks you would enjoy these cocktails. Pretty good spot if you want to have soju with good ambience. I would come again but if I had to wait I'd just opt for another spot since there are so many places close by that offer similar food a drinks."}
{"text":"Loved it, its cozy place, the food was amazing, first time I had kimchi fries, tacos and bulgogi, was not disappointed.
for sure I'm going back."}
{"text":"Walking into this restaurant, you would not think you're in the heart of Yonge and Sheppard. This restaurant has the right mix of fusion food and decor; At times in this area, you're either stuck with chain restaurants like Moxie's, or really \"ethnic\" restaurants with limited decor and service.

Han Ba Tang is the perfect mix and they have an awesome cocktail list to boot! I thought I could be in Ossington!

Really love the long, communal table in the middle, which is where our party sat for a going-away/birthday fete. This allowed everyone to try all the various foods including tacos that combine Korean fan-faves like Kimchi and grilled-beef.

I hope to see many more restaurants like this in the area which clearly caters to the young and hip, but keeping in theme with the food types that are increasingly growing popular.

Service was great and accommodating! Ambiance hip and fun! Totally a fan!"}
{"text":"We got a wicked table for 8 of us right at the front window! Overall, good prices, ambiance and service, but not super excited to urgently come back and eat! 

There were some dishes that were really good, and others that weren't so impressive. 

OUR Favourites:
Kimchi fries with bulgogi beef - perfect! Beef was super flavourful and tender. 
Spicy pork tacos - by far the best taco, great flavour, nice sauce... I wouldn't even bother getting the others! 
Crispy shrimp - love the sauce on this dish! I scraped it up and put it on everything! 
Curried chicken wings - in a dry rub, these were amazing on flavour and so so juicy inside! Bomb wings! 
Creamy rice cakes - loved this so much! It's like a bacon flavoured Mac and cheese! 

Not so epic:
Spoon pizza - this was a weird combination of flavours. It really does taste like a pizza made with mashed potato instead of a dough crust. Didn't like the tomato sauce flavour with the sweet mash. 
Tofu taco - was lack luster. Needs a sauce. Pretty plain. 
Kimchi pancake - also lack luster. 
Kalbijjim (beef short ribs) - the meat was a little dry and chewy. But my friend says they order this all the time and it's usually much more tender. I think we got unlucky with some ribs that were too lean. 

We had to cancel our spicy chicken and kalbi pan dishes because we were too full but I'll definitely be back sometime to try it! 

If you like spicy ask for their home made hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Went for drinks and some Korean fusion. It's ok, nothing memorable. Will not repeat,not worthy of any anticipation or wait."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. The restaurant on the front says they close at 2:30am, but they started last call around midnight and than started to kick us out at 1:20. My friend still had a full bottle of beer that she didn't even finish yet and the waitress wanted to take it away. When we said we're not done, the waitress tells us we have 2 mins. Food very so so and the drinks are over priced. Will not recommend anyone to come and won't ever come back."}
{"text":"The mister and I came by on a Sunday night after passing this place many times going to or leaving Nomé. They have such a cute decor inside, exposed bricks which leads into a \"shed like\" decor (the washrooms resembles an outhouse - not so cute but meh).

It was pretty packed for a Sunday and it took a while for the waitress to take down our order and bring our drinks which was fine because we were busy observing the best bartender ever! He has so much swag that it was mesmerizing. 

Anyway, we got the unagi taco, lobster taco, king prawn, mac and gochujang with baby octopus and tuna tartare - every thing was delicious. They also serve delirium - my favourite Belgium beer of all times.

Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"They have very good rice cakes, kimchi fries with bulgogi is one of my favs. Tacos are great fillers - many different choices I tried chicken, pork belly, unagi were all good, the lobster taco was a bit too spicy and crispy for me. Spoon pizza is good as well as their Mac and cheese dishes. The squid was mediocre. Fried shrimp prawns was delicious- comes in 6 pieces great flavour. 

Their sangria is very good! Had a chance to try their Soju flights , it's unique with different flavours. The most unique was ginseng- if you like ginseng you should try it out, if not don't because it is very strong ginseng flavour. The best one I enjoyed is the pineapple. 

Previously I was not pleased as they did not honour my specific seating reservation, however since then the owner Chae as well as the hostess from that night had messaged me to resolve the issue. I decided to give HBT another try. They ensured that the seating was as expected at the main communal table as requested. The hostesses were all very friendly. As well as I left the manager Harry had personally spoke to me and ensured that the seating issues would not occur again. I was pleased with their service and efforts to resolve my dissatisfaction from my former visit. 
Will be back again!"}
{"text":"popped in here for dinner one day without a single expectation or idea of what kind of food i was going to get.

their happy hour drink specials are awesome - seems this area loves its goose!

I got the pork taco's and they were spicy but delicious, i almost felt like i was eating authentic taco's in playa de carmen! although i felt a little rushed in there (they had a long line up of people waiting to be seated) i really enjoyed my time here.

The tables are a little cramped and really together but other than that it was good, the music in the background wasn't too loud either. I could hear my friends across the table!"}
{"text":"Food is good very innovative dishes, however the service is really slow. Please get extra waitress!"}
{"text":"So after reading the reviews, I came here after work. I've been waiting all week for this. 
First at 6 pm on a Friday night, it was dead. But I got to see the restaurant and all the details. It is a very trendy spot, loved the decor. The music was loud and I assume it gets busy later in the nights. 

The food was okay. The shrimp was delicious. Large, spicy with a little kick. Serving came with about 6. Really enjoyed it.
I was looking forward to the spoon pizza, with sweet potato base, ours was regular potato, so right off the bat, that was disappointing. 
The BBQ chicken with cheese, was good. It need some spice though. 

I'm not sure if I'd be back for the food in particular but the Drink menu sounds delicious, so I might be back for some sampling!! I did try to live to 1000 cocktail, and that was good!"}
{"text":"Intersting spot. As mentioned below it does have a hipster vibe with the lack of signage, very wooden interior, and soju flights.  But I thought it was all reasonably well done. Bulgogi was great and a good portion size.  Fish tacos were average. Crawfish salad was very tasty but portion a touch small.  The elderly lady (the owner?) was very nice to us. Would go back if in the area not for a meal meal but to split a pitcher and snack on Bulgogi."}
{"text":"This place was amazing.

The atmosphere was different from your usual Korean restaurant, but the food is so much more amazing! Their fushion style really suits many eaters. We ordered the Kimchi Fries and Creamy Rice Cake and Fried Chicken Wings. They were all equally as enjoyable. Service was prompt and friendly.

Definite recommendation!!! GO HERE"}
{"text":"A new restaurant in the Yonge and Sheppard area.  The food is served in tapas style.  I dont usually like going to these types of restaurants but i really like the atmosphere at this place.  We ordered the kimchi mushrooms, crsipy shrimp, sweet potatoe fries, grilled salmon, beef and pulled chicken tacos.  Overall the food was very tasty. It didnt fill me up entirely but that wad expected from a tapas place.  I would come back here again for drinks with friends. The entire front of the restaurant is open in the summer so it has a very cool patio feel.  There is enough variety of alcohol to choose from.  I'll come back again!"}
{"text":"As promised, went back and tried their Korean cold noodle.  There are few different kinds but this one looked like \"chic naeng-myun aka arrowroot noodle\") It's the dark noodle.  Anyway, they only have it in the cold soup - which I didn't mind since I love it! (They do not have bi bim naeng myun)

So the taste - It was pretty darn good!  Wish there was cucumber garnish (love cucumber and typically comes with naeng myun) and some kimchee or some sort of side dish.  Hey, I'm Korean and need some kimchee fixin'!!  It was  just a bowl of noodle for $10.  That's no bueno.  So we ended up asking for some kimchee and also ordered their flat dumplings.

Still, I love cold noodles and it's hard to find places that does a good job of it.  I will be back for some more! Nom nom nom~~"}
{"text":"Ha Ban Tang needs to make some improvements if it wants to be a thriving restaurant in the future.

I was there last night with a friend after we couldn't get into Nome Izakaya, next door. We were supposed to be there for the \"buck-a-shuck\" oysters but the waitress told us it would be a super long wait so we ended up at Ha Ban Tang. 

The service was beyond slow. The restaurant was virtually empty and even though there was enough wait staff, we had to keep calling them over. They were sweet but did not seem professional.

My friend and I ordered beer and the spicy pork tacos which were SO spicy we were drinking water between each bite. The only thing we ordered were 2 tacos each because it took us forever to finish them. The waitress even left sauce on the table for us but before we could ask her what it was she walked away. 

Their drink and food menu was disappointingly boring and unoriginal. The weather is pretty cold and I don't know who would drink caesars and mojitos. I wanted a mix drink that night but ended up getting beer since it was the only thing that wasn't tropical. 

The good news is their bathrooms are very clean and even smell pleasant! 

My tip to them would be to work on training staff, having daily specials, interesting menu items, and maybe adding oysters to your menu! You have to compete with your neighbours and not let them take all your business, which they clearly are."}
{"text":"Went the first time and it was a good experience. The second time not so well. This place has been really overhyped by social media and youthful Asians on Instagram portraying it to be the cool Korean fusion bar on willowdale. It provides a great drinking and loud environment with a variety of cocktails. It peeves me to write a negative review for a new hot trendy place, but it has to be done. I ordered fish tacos, kalbi tacos, spicy pork tacos, chicken tacos, creamy rice cake, kimchi fries+bulgogi, spoon pizza. These are basically what everyone has recommended to me over social media. 

Fish tacos: came really bad and dry, surprisingly the waitress told us that it would taste \"much better\" with Tabasco sauce meaning it probably wouldn't have much taste...and it didn't taste that good and they costed 4 dollars each. 1/10

Kalbi tacos: they came in two minutes after we ordered them. Meaning they were probably made for another table as a wrong order and given to us. Ridiculous, as they were cold and soggy. The first time I came here they were amazing however. 7/10

Spicy pork/chicken tacos: they were whatever, wouldn't order again. 5/10

Spoon pizza: a concoction of mashed potatoes, cheese, and kimchi and eat with a spoon for like 10 dollars. Not my cup of tea. 5/10

Creamy rice cake: doboki slathered in Alfredo sauce. For 10$ you get 15 rice cakes, aside from the price it's actually pretty tasty and good. But for the price? No. 7/10

Kimchi fries with bulgogi: best thing I've had here, and sadly the only thing that lived up to its hype. The fries are perfect and golden, basically a poutine with mayo and kimchi and beef and all its fixings. But it comes with a steep price tag of $18 dollars. 8/10

My review may be treated and looked down upon as being the first the criticise this establishment but many probably feel the same. The steep price tag and mediocre food do not make customers happy, although the place is packed every weekend night. How? Social media, referrals and a great place to hang out and have a drink with friends. Overall I would come here if a friend asked me to but wouldn't come here more than once or again unless I had to."}
{"text":"Great place to take a date, to hang out with friends or just to spend a fun night out. Food is great, you have to try the Kalbi beef, wings and Kimchi fries. The food and the service has turned me into a repeat customer. The music is great and in fact they were nice enough to accommodate us by playing a specific song of our choice which showed they truly cared about customer service. The ambience is semi-formal yet relaxed with the dim lighting, the price is slightly high but it is on par with the rest of the area. Will definitely keep visiting!"}
{"text":"Lobster tacos and kimchi fries are a must!  Fish tacos need a bit more flavour - try the house-made habanero sauce if you dare!  Will definitely go back for more!!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner! Cute little place! I would have totally walked past it since there isn't a sign outside. 

Great hospitality. The servers are really nice and sweet :)! We had three different kinds of tacos: lobster, eel, beef, as well as kimchi fries, creamy rice cakes, sweet potato chips, black calamari, battered shrimp, lobster Mac and cheese And maybe two more dishes I can't remember! Plus they're sangria. The total came to $30 per person for six people. Not too bad as everyone was carrying the stomachs out! We were really full!

All the dishes were good. The Mac and cheese was SPICY! Oh and they had this special spicy sauce in a little squeeze bottle that could be used on everything! That was delicious and a great kick to all the dishes! Don't forget to ask for it if they didn't put it on the table after!"}
{"text":"I adore korean food and when I first heard about this place, I was skeptical but I decided to give it a try! The restaurant is one of the many many options available near Sheppard/Yonge. 

There were definitely a few items that I wanted to try during my visit. As a party of three that night, we decided to order a few items and share for dinner. 
1) Spoon Pizza- yummmm, it was super cheesy and heavy but because we shared the food, we had just enough before feeling overly stuffed. 
2) Kalbi tacos - We ordered three of these so that we could have one each. The kalbi was juicy and so flavourful! This was definitely a highlight of the night.
3) Creamy Rice Cake - I can never get enough rice cakes so of course I had to order this item. With that being said, I thought the combination of the cream sauce and the rice cakes was interesting but not what I had expected, it was a bit too heavy for my liking.

It was also cocktail night so we opted for the strawberry inception (yum! this was light and refreshing) and the peach beach (wasn't as fruity and light as the other drink). We also noticed infused soju by the walls and the kitchen; I definitely will give some of these a try the next time I'm back.

Overall, the menu items are unique and worth a try! It was a balanced mixture of korean and mexican :)."}
{"text":"Great for cheap eats, late night munchies and drinks. Quite liked the ambiance there. 
Food was very flavorful, some of the dishes were very hot so be careful.
Recommend: fried tiger prawns, spicy pork tacos, kimchi fries with bulgogi
Maybe because the dishes contained too much salt, I needed to drink lots of water afterwards, this was the only drawback."}
{"text":"There is a lot of hype surrounding this place, it's supposed to be the \"spot\" for frequenters of K-Town and I've heard many good things about it.  I decided to give it a shot with some company and we headed in on a Wednesday night.

The place was surprisingly packed for a Wednesday evening, with booze flowing and Korean tapas style food being served.  I must say the decor was on point.  This place was the epitome of a hipster palace and you almost felt as if you were in another city when you sat down.

We ordered various dishes including the Rice Cakes, Pizza, Calamari, Kimchi Fries, Bulgogi, Tofu with Pork Belly and a plethora of drinks.  I decided to eat the food sober, so I would be able to give an honest opinion on it.  The food was good, it wasn't great and it definitely was over priced for what it was.  The Kimchi fries with Bulgogi in large size was around $20+, coincidentally you can get the same taste, portion and size at Banh Mi Boys for around $6.

Service was dope, and our waitresses always made sure the drinks were flowing and the food was cleaned up as soon as we finished.  You might even consider this the Korean Guu, as the prices and service are about the same.  Be prepared to pay around $50+ for drinks and food with a group of your finest homies.  Also to note, I was still hungry after my dinner here that I decided to gorge out on nachos at the nearest 7/11.  Dirty I know, but at least I admitted it."}
{"text":"An interesting place! A friend and I stopped in for a night cap, but the name is not on the outside of the building. Odd. He had been before and wanted me to try some Korean drinks. 

It was a Friday night and it was packed! We got the last 2 seats at the bar. The bar only seats 4 people, so it was tight. We got drinks and hung out for about half an hour when our server offered us a table that had come available. Nice!

I've tried soju before, so we had the plum wine. I liked it! 2 bottles later, I really liked it! 

Would like to revisit to try the food."}
{"text":"Not sure what to say. I came often, now new weird menu. No lobster taco, no blacken squid. New offering pork belly on fire...  only tastes of lighter fluid. Feeling sad,and disappointed. Maybe trying to be cool, on,y drives your customers away."}
{"text":"Great place to go for drinks,  but don't go if you're looking for great food.

I've had great Korean food and good fusion,  this pales in comparison. 

The only thing I enjoyed was the kalbi tacos, but even then there was a measly portion of protein. The other dishes were a big fail, especially the spoon \"pizza\". If I wanted powdered mash from a box and pizza sauce from a can with cheese slopped on,  I'd ask my 7yr old niece to make me dinner. 

Overpriced for low grade food. If you are not familiar with Korean,  don't be swayed by the hip ambiance. This is not what good Korean fusion is suppose to taste like."}
{"text":"only been here as a bar, haven't tried their food yet, it did look delicious. 
as a bar: its got great decor, a nice long bench seat, if your a big group of people. drink specials like 10$ soju on mon tue and wed, and 14-16$ pitchers every day( till summer ends)  its a nice spot worth checking out for sure. the staff seem really friendly ( for now as they have opened not too too long ago) the music can be a little loud but its okay as a bar."}
{"text":"I've always had a good time at Han Ba Tang! They're usually super busy at night during the weekend so I would recommend making reservations if you have a large group. There's a Green P parking lot behind the restaurant or paid street parking to the side. 

Some of my fav dishes are the unagi taco! You get a large piece of unagi and it's super flavourful. If you want to add some spice they do have hot sauce in a bottle on the side. So feel free to make it as spicy as you would like! I also really liked the kalbi taco. 

Another favourite of mine is the kimchi fries and the spicy chicken (from the oven section)! Both are super tasty and filling. The spicy chicken also has rice cakes. 

Finally the white sangria is the perfect summer drink! It's crisp and light and one of my fav drinks on their menu! :)"}
{"text":"Came here after work on a Wednesday with a couple of friends. The inside was very dark but it was a cute little restaurant. Ordered the triple unagi, pulled pork and kalbi tacos and they all tasted great! The kimchi fries were also delicious and great to share. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Service
The waitresses are pretty and cute but not attentive at all to our needs. I came here the first time with a guy and I swear they came to check up on us frequently. This week I went with my girlfriends and holy cow, it's like waving for taxi service in a rural town. The waitresses just pass on by and ignore us. When they finally took down our order, I will say that their approach is gentle and nice but crap, can you please stop talking to the guys?? All of us drove that night and didn't want to drink so we were going to just eat and drink water. Bad choice! No one in this restaurant ever takes a peek to see if we need water. Damn, do I need to grow a pair to get these girls' attention? If we turn back time and compare it to when I came by with a guy, TOTALLY DIFFERENT SERVICE. What a shame.

Food
The food took a pretty long time to come but thankfully it was hot. I think this place is more suited for bar food and not necessarily dinner as they are mostly fatty foods - not to really fill you up. The kimchi fries are really good and worth ordering for every visit. The crispy prawns can be skipped, not that it was bad, but it's just kind of boring. I believe you cannot eat the tails so proportion-wise, it will not get you full. The tacos were spot-on, lots of content, juicy, and very well-seasoned.

I would never come back for a girls' night but with a couple guys, sure why not lols."}
{"text":"FOOD: 4.5/5 - I really enjoy their food at Han Ba Tang. It's Korean with a fusion twist. I have never been disappointed in any of their dishes after several visits. My favourite is their Creamy Rice Cakes, very spongy and creamy. Their Tofu kimchi pork belly and Kalbi tacos are also delicious and are meant for sharing (3 pcs for $10-$13). Spoon Pizza was a creative spin on pizza flavour except it's mashed potatoes instead of a dough. They also have a diverse drink menu from imported beer to creative mixed cocktails, you couldn't possibly dine without having a drink or two because the environment just suggest you to drink!

ENVIRONMENT: 4.5/5 Lively, dim-lit setting with a hip vibe, sometimes with loud music. It is going for an urban, industrial rustic type of look and appeal to the younger crowd. It could accommodate large group (usually in the long table in the middle of the restaurant) or smaller parties but definitely not toddler-friendly. 

SERVICE: 4/5 - Staffs are friendly and attentive. Though, sometimes I find them a bit too attentive. They kept checking up on us and interrupting my conversation I was having with my friends every now and then just to see how things are going. 

OVERALL: 4.5/5 - this is definitely one of my faves!"}
{"text":"Delicious cushion style food with a mix of Korean cuisine and Mexican dish. This restaurant may not be obvious to pedestrians because it does not even have a sign. You had to go close to the door to really know the restaurant is Han ban tang.

The ambience is very hipster like and the front features their own signature cocktail drinks, most notably the old-fashioned since most places don't even serve this alcohol. 

My friends and I ordered the beef bimbamjim and cheese pizza. My beef dish is very tender and the meat falls off from the bone. I'm also surprised to see that they serve jalapeño at the side (I guess this is mexican cushion afterall)

We also ordered tacos. Amazing yummy pork taco with mayonnaise sauce. Although this isn't exactly authentic mexican food, remember this is cushion style and this can be forgiven. 

Oh, I forgot to mention that the owner was nice enough to give me free bowl of rice - goes really well with the beef."}
{"text":"Just OK. Spicy rice and fish cakes are good though not on the menu (we opted for these since we were familiar with them, instead of HBT's creamy alternative). 

Kalbi tacos had good flavour but uninspired presentation and garnish. Same with the fried sweet/spicy shrimp tacos.

The kimchi fries with bulgogi beef was ok but the bottom lining of the serving pan was soggy tacos and what seemed to be brown gravy. Not sure what happened there.   

Cocktails are also very basic and nothing special. I had the \"Live to 1000\" consisting of soju, Hennessy cognac, and ginseng. It was OK but again nothing blew me away. 

Service was friendly and reasonably prompt given their busy atmosphere. It's a lively place but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and the service and food was amazing! Definitely would recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"I went to Han Ba Tang last Friday. It wasn't my first time there.  The place was about 40%  full as it was early (7:30 pm). The service was good and attentive. We ordered the kalbi and unagi tacos. They were both great but the unagi ones were better. Then, we had kimchee fries. They were amazing. We also ordered the korean pancake and spicy chicken. Beer was cheap. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place has became one of my favourite summer bar. Their window seats is awesome with street view and special lighting. The main reason I love this place is because it's awesome menu. Lobster taco, kimchi fries, kimchi tofu pork belly and special seafood soups are wonderful. The Only downside is that this place is relatively priced. Alcohol is more expensive than other bar. You are expected so spend around 35 dollars per person for a dinner."}
{"text":"So my brother's girlfriend suggested this place and it was nice!  Very hipster and trendy!

The place is small, so I wouldn't recommend bringing very large groups for more than 10 for a gathering.  

Now I have mixed emotions when it comes to the food, I give food alone between 3-4 stars as it was 50/50 with all the food we got.  Some was really good and others were okay.  The drinks we got were good as well as they had $6 cocktail drinks on Wednesdays so we lucked in there.

The staff were very friendly and polite, checked in from time to time.  The food came out at a steady pace, one after another which gave us time to enjoy a dish together one at a time.  So we didn't have to wait long at all for our food or drinks. 

I had my 3 year old daughter with me and she ate some of the stuff but if your child is a picky eater and doesn't like to eat new things, I probably wouldn't recommend bringing children to eat here.  They did have a booster seat so it is available if needed.

Overall, I would probably go again if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"I feel like this place could easily be a 5 star spot...  But the service was pretty crapy...  My biggest pet peeve is when it takes your waiter a long time to serve you water or greet you..  Food was OK portions are a bit small...  I had the blacked calamari it taste good, not too rubbery like most places.   My buddy got the taco sampler he was not satisfied with his decision.   I really like the ambiance a cool hipster place. 
Would I come back? Maybe..."}
{"text":"Went with kids at 5:30 ish. You wouldn't think this is a kid friendly place but it was a great experience. Food came out fast, service was awesome. 
Food is okay but the accommodating service made the experience."}
{"text":"Lots of Asian people come here to drink cheap beer. Not really here for food. I guess it's very different because it's uptown. But they are doing food that downtown restaurants have been doing five years ago. Had the kimchi fries. They cooked it well but pretty boring. Music is very loud. Very uncomfortable chairs. I would not come back."}
{"text":"Poor customer service.
Tried to book the large table for my sisters bday here and got bumped to the back table instead."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here to relax and catch up. We had just ordered their soju drink. Before we had the chance to order our second round the owner came up and asked if we wanted any food. We were in the middle of our conversation so we said no for now. She quickly turned sour and told us that because there was 5 of us we had to order food or more drinks because they had a line. There was no line and half the place was still empty. Needless to say we left. Worst experience ever. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Gotta thank BLogTO for this one...place doesnt even have a sign...but after my visit, i hope they never do...walked in with a group place was packed....put our self on the reservation list....went to a bar next door ....didntt get our call...so we headed back...still packed but service was great and they actually took one of the reserved seats and gave it it us....Rd 1 Crispy shrimp; giant prawn in a beautiful korean sweet sauce....the taste would marinate my entire pallete....must have...Rd 2 and the reason for me going was the spoon pizza....cheesy goooey....a new experience that changed my life....Rd 3 was chicken taco.....korean taco's served cold ....lets just say it was the least favourite out of the 3 items...The owner personally came and talked to us....amazing lady...she put her heart and soul into this restaurant...and it shows...AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Came here in a Fri night, expecting it to be busy and live...and it was! 
Great atmosphere, with the rustic decor and fancy sign inside. 
Hard to find since there isn't a sign outside but we found after a few minutes of walking back and forth. 

We had a table booked ahead of time for a birthday, and although it wasn't what we expected, we did get seated quite quickly...at the very back table. 

The food and drinks were uniquely 'fused' between modern cuisine and traditional Korean dishes.

Some favorites: spicy pork tacos, Kimchi fries with bulgogi, creamy rice cakes, and the spicy soup were all delicious. 

Drinks were great as well,  they have 'bottle service' that comes in 375ml bottles of a few liquors and comes with a bottle of chaser juice or pop. 
What comes highly recommended is the white sangria.  It's absolute fantastic. 

Service was overall quite good, they're quick with the orders and making sure we were alright. I guess that's a perk of the table in the back, right beside the bar and kitchen. 

Aside from the seating occurrence, this restaurant is a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated Korean bar. It looks more upscale compared to the ones in the Korean town along Bloor. Music played is top 40, which I personal prefer. The place gets busy so reservations for groups are recommended. The staff are extremely friendly and the owner (or manager?) was there making sure everything is okay. We ordered this spicy chicken and cheese dish that comes on a grill which was good, a must order. The white sangria is a must order. The army stew was okay. The kimchi fries was good too. We would go back to visit."}
{"text":"My friend recommended trying out this restaurant.  She said it was a Italian, Mexican and Korean fusion.  The outside has no restaurant sign and the only way you know the restaurant name was if you looked through the window.  It has a big lit up sign saying \"Han Ba Tang\".  It wasn't too hard to find as she gave me the address.  I walked in and was greeted by a young gentleman and seated right away. The restaurant was pretty small but was nicely decorated with chalkboards of their featured menu items as well as the specials that they served at the bar.  By the waiting area they also had a variety of their homemade soju, which was interesting and then I noticed they offered a \"soju flight\".  I took a look through the menu and my friend told me what she recommended and what she tried on her previous visit.  We ended up ordering the Lobster Taco (3), Kalbi Taco (1), Creamy Rice Cakes, and the Kalbi Pan Dish.  I found the dishes mediocre in taste and the portions are very small for the price you pay.  I'd say their dishes are more Tapas style.  In the end, I wasn't full and I wasn't really satisfied.  The service was really good, all of the waiters and waitresses we had were attentive to our needs and were really nice.  I was just disappointed in the food so I can only give it a 3 star and probably will not come here again, unfortunately."}
{"text":"In short: Food was delicious but service was terrible. We also had food poisoning after our meal. In long: Came here with 5 others. We ordered pork, kalbi and unagi tacos. Unagi definitely the favourite with creamy avocado balancing the umami of unagi. Fries in kimchi fries were hot and crisp, and just thick enough to stand up to kimchi and cheese topping. A well done dish. Spoon pizza is tasty but you really can't go wrong with mashed potato, tomato sauce and a whole lot of melted cheese - not the best value given the small portion size, inexpensive ingredients and big price tag. Black squid was marinated in black bean sauce and grilled tender but also overpriced. Server was rude and unfriendly. Made us feel like we were a nuisance throughout the entire meal, when our only special request made at the end of the meal was to have the bill split. She didn't even acknowledge my thanks as I left the resto. Food poisoning set in at end of the night. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I always make a point to come here whenever I visit Toronto. The prices are pretty good when sharing, and almost everything we've ordered have tasted great!

I usually call in for a reservation, but I have found that they're not too crazy busy nowadays so you could likely walk in and be fine. There is a paid parking lot in the back.

Our usual orders are the kimchi fries (bulgogi optional but not necessary), spicy chicken with cheese, and creamy rice cakes. The spicy chicken with cheese is good to share between 3-4 people, and the presentation is just so good. It's also cheaper here than I see at similar places. The small kimchi fries is a good size for $10, and the creamy rice cakes are just so tasty with the bacon.

We also tried the daily special, the king prawns, which was really good and had 6 pieces - excellent value for the daily special price! I'll definitely check out the daily specials in the future.

Some items that I would not order again would be the tacos, spoon pizza, and the soju flight. The soju flight is really neat for the novelty but taste-wise, we found it either too sweet or too strong, not smooth at all.

Service is hit or miss. The most recent time, we had a really great waitress who checked on us often, filled our water, and mixed up the chicken dish we had. Other times, we had to seek our waiter for the bill, etc. Either way, they're happy to help!

The only thing I'm not a fan of is the washroom. I know it sounds silly, but it's not the most comfortable washroom. You have to walk down a steep and narrow passageway, then it's really cold since it's a basement and the stalls are tiny.

I'll still keep coming for sure to get my Korean snack fix!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Their food never disappoints and I love the ambience of the place - very cool bar theme! Their tacos are quite good but my favourite is their spicy chicken dish! They also have some amazing fries as well! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place! Very busy on a Friday night but the servers really did their best to make sure we're not waiting too long in line. The hostess actually told us the wait is 20 minutes but it turned out only 5 minute wait! When we sat in, a server took our order right away and was very helpful when we asked questions about the menu. 

The bacon spoon pizza was very comforting. I love how it's so cheesy and it felt very comforting to eat on a cold winter night. If you're a cheese and bacon lover, this dish is definitely a must try because it's delicious! This reminds me of something I would definitely ask my mom to make when I was little.

I also like the kalbi tacos. The mest was very tasty and altogether it had bold flavours. It would have been better if we're able to mix the taco orders and try rhe other ones but it's okay...the more reason to go back and try the other food items!

Overall, it was a great food experience. I love Korean food and I love tapas. So if you put it together, it's definitely the place to be! Awesome atmosphere and I love the decorations. It looks like a hole in the wall from the outside but the inside is very artistic. 

Will definitely come back for more food next time!"}
{"text":"Kimchi Fries are a must try! Great tasting food with an urban vibe. Like some have said, parking is tricky, we had to pay for parking around the corner, but I'd say it was worth it. Everything we tried was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Popped in here with some family a few weeks back as I'd heard some good things. Service was slow, took about 15 minutes to get a cocktail in front of me. We tried a wide variety of dishes, and overall no one was really impressed.

That being said, I would definitely go back for a beer and a bunch of the pork tacos, they were proper."}
{"text":"This small restaurant is exactly the type of vibe North York and the Yonge street needs. Great food, and atmosphere I would recommend it for anyone looking for something different. 

The service Korean tapas, reminiscent of an izakaya but the Korean version (there is probably a term for this). Small dishes meant to share, and lots of great drink. 

The drink and cocktail menu looks awesome. I would also love to try the flight of soju for $15. Seems like they make their own, on display in the front. I will have to come back here when I can drink alcohol. 

The menu is meant for sharing. Ask if unsure about portion sizes. And check outt he chalkboard for specials. I wouldn't say the food was mind blowing, but it was good. There wasn't one dish that I was drooling over in the end. 

Definitely get the tacos. Best was the lobster tail. 

Would also recommend the KIMCHI FRIES for sharing. The sweet potato fries was like deep fried tempura. It wasn't amazing. 

The CUTLET PLATE  ($22) is great for a sampler of meat. A good size you get 3 prawns, two pieces of fish, and a tonkatsu pork. 

The spicy chicken with cheese fondue is interesting, but found that the cheese didn't really add much to the flavour. Also yummy was the PAN FRIED KALBI

The SPOON PIZZA was good but nothing really special unless you're craving for cheese. I would skip this any maybe get a soup.

Han Ba Tang allows reservations and for us to big table of 15 with still ample space for other patrons. It's small and cozy, but you dont feel squished.

The service was excellent and our waitress was super friendly, couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"Environment:  this place as a chill feel, definitely very eclectic. The sign outside is pretty washed out so unless you know what you're looking for you might miss finding this place. 

Service: friendly service. The place was pretty busy but they managed to manage some seating for us. 

Food: it's decent here. Typically get the kimchi fries, doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

I finally stopped by this place after walking pass it a million times! Every time I ask my bf if we can go to han ba tang, he'd be like nah he's not into Korean bars. But today I put my foot down and i said we're going, end of story! So we arrived here at 6pm, and it was empty except for maybe two tables. We were seated quickly at a table which is right next to an outlet (yay for those that needs to charge their phone). 

I was really excited to try their flavoured soju and ordered their soju flight - $16 (Friday special). Flavours were strawberry, pineapple and apple cinnamon (which are apparently the popular ones). My favourite would definitely have to be the pineapple soju, not as strong :p - I have a low tolerance for alcohol. 

As for the food, we ordered three items. First, was the kimchi fries with bulgogi - $10 + $3 add-on. Adding the bulgogi is a must. Second, was the creamy dukbokki with bacon - $10 and finally the spoon pizza (sweet potato base) - $11. 

The kimchi fries were good but nothing spectacular, I do like the kimchi fries more at banh mi boys though. Creamy dukbokki was good because it had bits of bacon and was also cheesy. And the spoon pizza has a sweet potato base which I like because 1) I felt like I was eating something healthy, 2) I love sweet potato.

Please note that these are small portions and are meant to be shared. As for the service, it was not too bad. Our water got refilled throughout our time there, but it was a bit hard to wave down someone for the bill because it got super busy later on the night. I tried waving down the manager? Or was he a waiter? Not sure, but seemed like he was busy flirting with one of the hostess lol. Anyway, finally got the bill and bam! Total was around $60! So be prepared to pay a little bit more than expected.

Overall, I'd come back again because I really enjoy the vibe here. They got good music and great drinks and food! If you don't like coming here when it's busy, come right when they open!"}
{"text":"Late Night Hangout at HanBaTang

Hanbatang
Location: 4862 Yonge Street, North York
Access: Along TTC bus route, Subway (Shepherd and Yonge Station), Paid parking available
Price: $15-$30
Blogsters' Rating: 4/5

HanBaTang meaning one full round is a Korean fusion restaurant & bar located at Yonge and Shepherd. On a busy Friday night around 10pm, my friend and I waited around 15 minutes for a table for 2.

I really like the interior of this rustic looking bar.

Strawberry Inception
Grey goose, strawberry soju, yogurt
Very fruity drink well- balanced with yogurt and vodka. Not overly sweet or sour which makes it just right.

Peach Beach
Gin, soju, peach liquer
This was a very summery slush with a sweet fruity aroma. However, it was a little too sweet for me.

Sweet Potato Fries with Cauliflower Dip
This was my favorite dish at HanBaTang! The sweet potato chips were freshly fried and oh so crispy while the dip was rich and creamy. The chips were sweet and the dip was savory which balanced each other out very well. I really like how they heat the dip with a tealight underneath as if it were a fondue so that the cheese doesn't curd or dry up when it gets cold.  

Black Calamari
Grilled calamari with black bean sauce tasted like a very typical Chinese stir fry dish.
However it was cooked just right, not too dry and have a soft chewy texture. Nonetheless a wonderful snack to pair with drinks.

Spicy Pork Taco
Consists of spicy pork, onion, lettuce, parsley. It wasn't too spicy, just the right level of spiciness for me. The portion was rather small and I found that there was too much raw onion which overpowered the flavor of everything else.

HanBaTang is definitely a great late night hangout if you want to grab a drink or two with friends along with some delicious Korean Tapas. Definitely the perfect atmosphere for a Friday night out."}
{"text":"Sneaky little spot in North  York. Really good food, really good sangria. I can't wait to come back! My friends and I had the creamy rice cake, kimchi fries, and spoon pizza. We were SO FULL but it was so delicious."}
{"text":"So so good. Came on a Saturday night for dinner and shared a bunch of small plates - all were very yummy, with quick service. We ordered the tuna tartare, spicy pork and kalbi tacos, kimchi fries, and beef short ribs. Everything was tasty and fresh, portions were perfect without being overly greasy or salty like some other Asians can sometimes be. Awesome and will hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Fusion Korean food. 

Tried their Kimchi fries with added bulgogi (A+) and Crispy king prawns (B+). My friends ordered this meat lettuce wrap taco style dish where they lit it with fire when serving hot. Great execution but apparently the taste was so-so, as they could not finish it. That dish was pricy too.

Want to come back to try their Spoon Pizza (sounds so good)."}
{"text":"Hanbatang is serving up Korean tacos in the Yonge and Sheppard area. I will be back! 
Pros:

1) Nice service!
2) Cool concept from menu to decor
3) Food was tasty; Good variety on the menu
4) Nice ambiance, friendly place to hang out

Cons:

1) Portions are kind of smaller for the price point"}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting this establishment. The first time I attended, you can easily miss the place unless you looked at pictures of the exterior.

I came here with a group of 8 on Sunday evening for a get together. We ordered an assortment of food from the kitchen. The food was definitely delicious, but I don't think the prices reflect the quality and quantity of the food that you are getting. Some dishes came out like appetizers, but costed $11. I think what you are paying for is the ambience and food, not just food like other korean restaurants. So keep this in mind.

I did enjoy their take on a variety of traditional korean dishes and fusion. Flavourwise I was happy with the extra little something something that the restaurant adds to the dish. The one item that I enjoyed very much was the kimchi and bulgogi fries. They are very good: the fries are really crispy on the outside and I did not encounter any soggy fries.

Give this place a try for an experience, expect to shell out about $25+ per person."}
{"text":"I went to this place at night with a small group of guys, and this is not the first time i've been here, it is a asian fusion bar like atmosphere. where it is very hip and stylish with TV for sports around. One of those places you can bring a date or hang out with friends quite comfortably. One thing i have to point out about the difference in the visit this time around, is the fact that we had a beer mug accidentally break on us while someone in our group was drinking, the bottom of the mug just fell down and beer poured all over him. The reason i'm giving this place 4 star is the fact of how they responded to this, the manager of the night he apologized profusely and tried to make it right and explaining the situation. In my mind this is a good signal of the manager/owner of a place really caring about how the customer experience is. i believe it is not the mistakes but how you fix it. Overall the drinks and food were okay, it is a bit pricier but that is to be expected in this area and this type of decor in a restaurant. The kimchi fries are decent and very shareable. and they have a large selection of other snacks and cocktails. The service of course is what made me gave this place 4 star, even after an incident like that. I would recommend those nearby to drop by and use this place as a hangout to drink and enjoy with friends. it isn't very big though so be prepared to make reservations if possible."}
{"text":"So this waiter told me the taco is half Mexican and half Korean style lol. So I give it a tried and it wasn't bad at all. What kills me was when I saw pulled breast, I meant pulled chicken breast. Lol"}
{"text":"I went here on a weeknight with my friend. I thought it would be packed and would be difficult to find a seat. Surprisingly the weeknight is pretty quiet. It was also quite empty for a bar around 7:30. So next time, weeknight to go here it is!
We tried their spoon pizza. It was a little smaller than I had hoped. But surely enough for just the two of us to share. We also ordered a pork taco which I really loved! We ordered kalbi as well and it was a very small dish as well. In comparison to other more traditional Korean restaurants, this is definitely more of a tapas kind of place. 
I like the vibe and atmosphere here though. It's nice hipster feel for a night out for drinking and smaller food portion to share. 
Not the biggest fan of the price though."}
{"text":"3.5 to be exact.

My gf decided to have her birthday here on a Saturday night.  The place was very busy and loud.  You had to yell to have a conversation, kind of like a club lol.

My one friend and I both ordered the spicy chicken.  My original choice was the kimchi fries with bulgogi but I wanted an actual dish with protein and veggies.  Well, when my dish came out it was not exactly what I was expecting.  I should've thoroughly looked at pics on Yelp lol.  The spicy chicken was pretty spicy, it was like eating kimchi non-stop, but it was bearable with drinking lots of water lol.  I, for some reason thought the chicken was going to be breaded even though it didn't say that in the description.  Silly me.  Also, there were barely any veggies in the dish.  I was hoping for more. I found like maybe 2 small pieces of broccoli.  The rice cakes were also not what I was expecting.  They kind of look like pasta but are solid and really chewy.  I didn't like it at all.  The texture was weird and I didn't like the chewiness of it.  That's just me.  Others that I let try my food enjoyed the rice cakes. I also didn't think it was worth $12, as I thought it would be a more \"complete\" dish.

My one friend ordered the kimchi fries with bulgogi and after trying a piece of the bulgogi, I died and went to heaven.  The bulgogi is SOOO good!!  My other friend and I decided we effed up with our spicy chicken order and split a small kimchi fries.  The small is actually huge, so it's perfect for sharing.  The fries in the middle do tend to get soggy from all the sauces, so it's best to eat them fast.  Towards the end there are almost no crispy fries left.  However, best believe we pretty much killed those fries.  Kimchi was good too, but the main star was the bulgogi.

Service was okay.  The way they brought out the food was a bit complicated and messy.  There would be lulls in between each dish being brought out and they weren't sure which side of the table ordered what.  Our server was sweet and friendly though."}
{"text":"Only checked out this place because people kept posting about it. Food is regular, while charging a far more higher price than I would pay for. I dont mind paying for GOOD food. But this place definitely wouldnt be described as GOOD. Service is alright. Meets the standards. But seriously don't see anything that amazed my experience for me to return here again. Nice try though"}
{"text":"My time here was amazing! Loved the food (I got pork cutlet) and the place is so cute.
Anyone should really go in for a meal and they had very kind servers"}
{"text":"Great place to come to with a bunch of friends! The prices are reasonable. The decor is very nice. I definitely recommend that everyone should get the kimchi fries with bulgogi! It's very unique. The spicy pork taco is also one of my favourites! I also got the creamy rice cake and I must say, it tasted wonderful! When it arrived at our table, the temperature of the rice cakes was perfect! The rice cakes were not hard and was super chewy (just how I liked them)! 

If you want to try the soju flight, I recommend going with the apple cinnamon! The strawberry kinda tasted like cough syrup, haha."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Korean restaurants in North York! Great service every time I come - but be sure to come during off-peak hours because the location isn't very large. The food is consistent and the atmosphere is fun, but there's only street parking in front. Their portions to price ratio could be a little more generous, but still good food!"}
{"text":"-Ok tasting food, but  overpriced (e.g., tacos)

-a little tight due to the centre table

-like the atmosphere and lights

-will come back for drinks, but not food

FYI to customers: they dont take AMEX"}
{"text":"This place is cool!  The ambiance, decoration and feel is very modern.  The food was fantastic, spicy pork tacos are a must try.   

Also their cheese/corn dishes that come with a portable grill right to your table are delicious and unique.  

Although the service took a while, this place was very accommodating and took us without reservations. 

Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Found this place on the second try. There's no English sign outside, so for non-Korean speakers, this place is the one with the greenish storefront and no distinct name. Inside, it's very loud and fairly cramped.

Had:

Tuna tartare ($12) - Tasty, but absolutely not worth the price. The menu says \"yellow fin tuna, cucumber, onion, garlic oil, deep fried Korean sweet yam, deep fried perilla leaf\". I was expecting a scoop of tuna tartare surrounded by fried yam chips to scoop my tartare with. What I got were five small sweet yam chips topped with less than a teaspoon's tuna tartare on each. I could have fit the entire order of tuna tartare into my mouth at once. Even the lime wedge was tiny. I've never even seen a lime wedge that tiny on a drink. I feel totally ripped off.

Spicy Pork Taco ($10/3) - Also tasty, but not particularly unique, other than their taco shell. Soft taco shell with what I'm guessing was perilla leaf shreds in the dough of the shell itself. Not bad for $10, but not outstanding either.

Creamy Rice Cake ($10) - Served in a hot skillet. Bacon, sliced mushrooms, and rice cake in cream sauce. Comes with a side of pickled cabbage(?). Not kimchi. Looked like it's been dyed with beet juice (although for all I know, it was a totally different color. It's really really dark inside, so it was sort of hard to see...or take pictures...). Tasted sort of like a crisp cabbage pickle. Rice cake was the most satisfying of the three dishes we ordered, but some of the bottom pieces of rice cake were extremely salty. 

As a cheap foodie and an introvert, this really isn't my scene. The food's okay, but for the prices, I'd much rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place gets super busy as the night progressed.  Went both times on a Thursday night for dinner and drinks.  Food is a hit and miss but probably due to preference.  We tried the pizza and the kimchi fries.  The fries were pretty good but the pizza was just ok since I am not a big fan of pizza.  They have a wide variety of drinks ranging from infused flavoured soju and beer.  

The owners and staff were extremely friendly.  They were quick to serve us when we needed something plus the conversation was good as well.  There are not many places I know that have Mexican food with a Korean twist which is something new.Next time I will order the tacos and give them a try.  Also, they take reservations and were open to allowing me to book for 20+ people during the dinner session.

One thing to keep in mind is that the sign is not obvious.  There is Korean on the outside and the name of the place is on the inside.  The decor is nice and comfortable.  One advice to the restaurant is to have a sign in English on the outside not just so people can easily find it including emergency staff if needed."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. They take reservations which is rare for Korean restaurants. Everything is \"good\" on the menu but I wouldn't say its \"excellent\" like Odd Seoul on Ossington. However staff are super friendly and on my friend's birthday they gave us free soju bombs and sprayed a bunch of people with beer preparing it!"}
{"text":"Han Ba Tang is the cutest little place, definitely a little hidden gem you'd definitely miss if you didn't know about it. There's no big sign on the outside but the inside definitely gives a hipster and one of a kind type of feel. The atmosphere is friendly and it's a place you can get comfortable at, with wooden tables and mason jar cups. 

The servers here are really nice and friendly, they are attentive and quick with your order. Another thing I am a fan of are the cocktails they serve - they're pretty unique and hard to find in most restaurants. It's kind of a korean thing, but the drinks are amazing, like strawberry soju and cucumber mint soju.

I also enjoy the food a lot, and this place is known for their korean tacos. They have pork tacos, fish tacos, kalbi tacos etc. My fave is the spicy pork, and even though in the beginning I didn't believe 3 tacos could fill you up (like recommended on the menu), it really does.. unless you're starving.

The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because it's pretty pricey for small portions. Not a place I'd go to all the time for some cheap good food. But DEFINITELY worth a try."}
{"text":"Good food, good ambience, excellent selection of beers and cocktails. Only problem is the \"easy bite\" chicken wings. The cut the chicken wings in half? Don't think it's necessary looks like you only get half the wing portion. Anybody have problems eating a chicken wing? Let's not mess with it. Flavourful and crunchy, I would like the whole wing!"}
{"text":"Dimly lit, cozy place to relax with friends over some Korean drinks. 
Seating is pretty tight so you may want to make a reservation. 
They have a lot of interesting drink options available!"}
{"text":"I attended a menu preview event at Han Ba Tang this past Sunday evening. The meal and drinks were complimentary but my review remains honest and is truly my opinion of the food/experience.

I met the owner, Chi, and can safely say she is a super awesome lady. She said she created Han Ba Tang restaurant with Korean fusion tapas style cuisine so her daughter would have somewhere to take her future dates. How cute is that? The atmosphere is very warm and inviting. Chi did almost all of the work herself to transform the space to make it fun and interesting. PRO TIP : This place is an Instagrammer's heaven, perfect for cool photo ops ;) 

We tried so many menu items, all really delicious. The highlights for me were the sou-vide cooked chicken salad, kimchi fries, spoon pizza, Korean stewed beef, and the persimmon dessert. The chicken in the salad was so tender and I loved the tangy Korean mustard and soy vinaigrette. Kimchi fries were so tasty, a perfect match for the yummy boozy soju based drinks we tried. I had opted for the pineapple soju cocktail which was really refreshing. I loved the spoon pizza, a bowl full of rib sticking comfort food - so cheesy, with soft mashed potatoes and kimchi. YUM, I could eat this all winter long. The Korean stewed beef was literally fall of the bones tender and delicious in a sweet and sour type of broth. Loved the hot Korean mustard on the side of the bowl to swipe the meat through. The persimmon dessert was such a nice surprise, airy layers of cake sandwiched with frozen persimmon sorbet was such a light and refreshing way to finish a great meal.

Great service, fun drinks, delicious food, an owner who cares, and located very close to the subway = perfect spot for date night or fun gathering IMO. Can't wait to return again!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night around 9pm with a group of 7. They do take reservations so it was great not to have to wait for a seat. Got a variety of tacos including kalbi, spicy pork and lobster. Priced at 3 for $10 it is not bad, the tacos arent the best in the city the tortillas were a bit cold but it will do for uptown. The best part is the drinks though! As a fan of fruity cocktails there were plenty colourful drinks to choose from with their infused soju. And mine came with a little paper umbrella =)

There are many \"you cant really screw up\" dishes including: Kimchi fries which were delicious but, cant really mess up pilling fries with bulgogi. The spicy chicken was good (just like every other korean restaurant) for an extra $3 you can added ooey gooey although a bit grainy cheese fondue to dip the chicken in. A crowd pleaser- spoon pizza, mashed potatoes with pizza toppings instead of a dough crust - tasted like a high brow pizza pocket 

The service is great, attentive and very friendly especially the owner! And its great that they are opened late until 2.30am, a great place to go out for the night for drinks and food"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday so it wasn't super packed. Ordered the Kalbi salad, spicy pork tacos, kalbi tacos and unagi tacos with some soju and everything we ordered was excellent! I can't say for anything else on their menu but their tacos are spectacular! :D I really like how their taco shell actually holds everything in and doesn't start falling apart once you pick it up :P. The taco shell is also not the regular small shells you get at regular places, I'm pretty sure they make it themselves. Highly recommend all their tacos lol but I think my favourite was the unagi one!

Definitely coming back to their try Mac and Gochujang and Spicy Seafood Soup! Yummm"}
{"text":"Good vibes and good service here. Weekends can get a bit loud but great weekend deals on whiskey (and other liquors) by the small (375ml) bottle! If going for food, I'd recommend going before 8:30pm to get one of the items on the portable grill. I had the ribs and the chicken and would recommend the ribs, if only having one. Not many places do back ribs that fall off the bone that well. The beef waow bun was also delicious - wanted to get more but I couldn't justify the price."}
{"text":"First time visiting and found that the ambience is definitely one of its kind. Their own soju mix is unique and worth trying! 

The kalbi taco is definitely worth trying but spicy shrimp is too big for the taco and a bit too much to manage. Loved the kimchee fries and definitely their signature dish. The only disappointment is kimchee mushroom. It was overpowered by the cheese and kimchee taste is subdued."}
{"text":"it is quite a long time that I visited this resto. we went with a group of friends, it just like a izakaya but in Korean way. the food is okay, the portion is not bad. But it is just too noisy for me. In a small place like this, with the loud music, it's really difficult to chat."}
{"text":"Came across this place online, after seeing a picture of the entrance I quickly understood how I had walked by it so many times and never noticed!
The restaurant has a cool, modern, industrial look to it, not what you would expect by the front of the building.
Staff were nice, but definetly a little on the slow paced side. They offered us to try out a drink that was not on the menu yet, which ended up being quite tasty, but they never asked what we thought of it. Had to flag people down to get another drink, or the bill...
My boyfriend and I ordered the Taco taster plate each, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays you get a spicy pork taco, a kalbi Taco and an unagi Taco for 10$, which was perfect to try out a few things. Flavours were great, we both inhaled them, he even ate the unagi Taco, when he doesn't usually like eel.
We also ordered the Crispy King Prawn, those were delicious as well. And after reading reviews we HAD to try the Waow bun, we had ordered quite a bit of food so we spilt it, but if we were not as full as we were I think we would have ordered two more buns! They were so good!
I didn't get a picture of the specials menu, but know that there is one. I think Fridays and Saturdays they have a bottle special. Rib night. Cheap pitcher night... Pretty cool.
I order a \"Live to 1000\" off the cocktail menu after the waitresses recommendation, it was definetly not a drink for me, but they do have quite a funky variety of beverages to try, and the cocktails were on special as well, for 6$ instead of the usual 9-12$
Will definetly be going back to try some other menu items!"}

Han Ba Tang is a cute, hip and little industrial ambience Korean fusion bar right on Younge and Sheppard.

They offer some interesting korean style cocktails. 
I'm very happy to see this cute place in my neighbourhood. However I got few things to comment. 

First is their really slow and confused service. During my last few visit to the place, they made consistent mistake with my orders and no apologies or did anything to make up the mistake. I understand they were busy, but it's just unprofessional. 

Second is way over priced food. OK maybe I exaggerated a little bit. To be fair, most of their dishes are somewhat reasonably priced except tacos! I go to a lot of $$$$ sign places. If the quality of food is good, I have no problem paying for extra dollars but those tiny boring malnourished tacos almost made me to return them to ER. Anyway other foods are A-OK. They can do better than that. 

I see a lot of potential in this place. They already got a good drinks and hip ambiance that no bar in north-york offers. Only thing they need to work on is their quality of service and food menu/price. I liked the enthusiasm of owner lady and I hope she can really step up her game and make this little place into the best bar in North York. Until then I guess I'll travel to downtown."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with my coworkers. Had a great night! Very generous portions and food was great! Service was a bit slow because they were busy, but that was not a big deal for us. I personally recommend the spoon pizza, kimchi bulgogi poutine and the tacos. Reservations recommended as it gets quite busy at night! I will be back again!"}
{"text":"The creamy rice cake was pretty good and the contrast with the side dish in texture was refreshing. The kimchi fries were horrid, I may have to try it again with bulgogi though. The kalbi tacos were refreshing and this restaurants saving grace although I most definetly would not eat it again."}
{"text":"After seeing so many photos of this place on IG and reading some of the other reviews, I wanted to try this place out myself. Went here last night with 4 of my friends. We got a nice big table right at the front of the restaurant by the window. We ordered so much! Most dishes were pretty good..

My favourites:
Creamy rice cake - this had bacon. Need I say more...
Crispy Shrimp 
Spicy pork taco
Kalbi taco - the kalbi was nice and tender and flavorful.
Sweet potato fries with wasabi mayo - hands down the best sweet potato fries I've ever had. Loved the size of these things! So good. 

My not-so-favourites:
Fish Taco - worst choice ever. It was dry and bland. Never again

My \"it's okay, would order again but not the best\":
Lobster taco - I saved this for last after having the spicy taco, kalbi taco, and fish taco. I think by this time I was so full I did not thoroughly enjoyed this one. One of my friends loved this one and thought it was the best taco out of the four
Spicy chicken plate with cheese fondue - the chicken itself was really good and I really liked the sauce but the cheese fondue was more like just heated cream. It did not taste cheesy at all and was not worth the $3 add-on. 

Overall, I'd give this place a 4/5. 
The service was good. Our server was really nice and helpful. 
The decor was beautiful. I absolutely love the industrial decor of this place. I was quite impressed at all the details put into the decor. 
I would definitely go again...and try some of the other dishes. :)"}
{"text":"Service/atmosphere 
Bf & I came here on a Tuesday around 5pm, and when we were seated we realized we were the only customers at the time. Our server was good for quickly bringing us water and menus, but she didn't think to come take our orders. Her male coworker (who looked to be the bartender) had to come and take our order. He wasn't as knowledgable when it came to the menu items, but he helped us to the best of his ability. As we waited for our meal, being the only table in the joint, our server completely neglected us. The bartender(?) came around and filled our water glasses for us. It took 25 mins for our nachos and a small app of ours to arrive, but my bulgogi didn't come until 40 mins after we ordered it... not impressed considering it was prime dinner time and we were the only table there... 
By the end of the meal, the ONLY encounter we had with our server was when she originally seated us/brought us menus & water, brought us our food, and cleaned some tables nearby. The bartender was the one who took our orders, filled our water glasses and gave us the bill- he even checked if we were satisfied with the food. 
Wish the server spent less time talking to her friend at the bar and more time checking in on us and making sure our water glasses were filled instead of making her coworker do so...

Food quality and quantity 
We got the pulled pork nachos that was on special and they were fantastic! Both my bf and I were really impressed! He didn't like his waow bun that much but that's cuz it wasn't really his type of food. My bulgogi was pretty average, but not bad. It was a bit greasy and it probably could have had more meat chocked into it for $10... as they filled it with glass noodles even though the menu stated it would come with vermicelli noodles (thin rice noodles). 

Overall I don't think i'd come back unless it was for drinks, but definitely not for a sit down meal. Would order the nachos again but sadly they're only a Tuesday/Wednesday special. Hope the owner sees this and does something about customers being neglected by the servers  considering I saw other reviews having similar issues."}
{"text":"I am in love with their \"Easy chicken wings + curry powder\". It is an addiction. My friends and I will go here just to eat these wings and we will order one for each person they are JUST THAT GOOD. Sometimes we will dream about these chicken wings and end up having to go to HBT at 10pm on a Tuesday just to have these chicken wings. Did I mention how awesome these chicken wings are???

I really like the vibe for this place, I love their makgulli I always ask for them to give me the gigantic teapot so that I can get the full authentic Korean makgulli experience.

Other items I would recommend off their menu would be Bulgogi fries, Seafood stew and their macaroni spicy octopus (its really spicy)."}
{"text":"Because of all the great reviews, I decided to stop by and give this place a try. Unfortunately, my experience was disappointing. 

The atmosphere is brilliant though. I absolutely love it and the decor. However, the price for the portions of food served are not really worth it compared to other Korean eateries around the area. 

I'm sure this place is a great hit for drinks and cocktails with friends around the area (especially after karaoke!). Kind of disappointed on the service; our food and drinks took over half an hour and the friendliness from the staff seemed to be replaced with the cold shoulder.

For drinks, I'll come by again when there is less of a crowd (maybe that's why the service wasn't up to par?). But for the food, I might think twice as there are several other options around the area."}
{"text":"Korean tapas place. Good food, nice atmosphere, good service. Recommend it if you never tried Korean style tapas/izakaya place."}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype and hoola about this place when it first opened. Back then, it seemed that every time I opened FB I would see friend's posts raving about this place. On my first visit, I understood why; they were giving away free drinks for posts. Well, it's been almost a year now after 3-4 visits later I don't really know what the hype is all about.

The places looks deceptively inviting and cozy. While the tables off to the sides are great the middles bar-like seats leave a lot to be desired. Anyhow, the decor is rustic and lovely when it's all said and done which is really is quite inviting.

They are ambitious when it comes to food. The menu sounds incredibly unique and delicious but the execution is lacking. Even the ever enticing pork belly couldn't save them! The tacos are a pile of unfamiliar tastes. The fried chicken doesn't really taste like....well fried chicken. And the rest of the menu isn't really worth mentioning except I think there was some weird-ass tofu stuff? The drinks are interesting at least and they do taste good (but it's difficult to mess up anything you pour out of a bottle really...most of the time).

Come here for drinks and sit on the seats to the sides. Don't come here if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Restaurant has a great decor, however food is pricey for the quality that you get. The tacos really weren't appealing (Grocery store tortilla, minute amount of filling), and the rest of the items we ordered weren't the greatest. Prices are definitely over the top.
Slow service, slow kitchen and cheap with the hot sauce"}
{"text":"We recently visited Han Ba Tang with some friends that were back in town. Some quick Googling brought up this (relatively) new restaurant in our neighborhood.

At first Mexican-Korean fusion may sound a little odd, but it's really not a big stretch. Kimchi, sliced meat and potatos? Great! Spicy stir-fry with noodles? Can't go wrong. Sweet potato fries with wasabi mayo? Standard fare. Tacos with Asian sauces? More! The food was enjoyable, though pricing-portion sizing felt a little off for some dishes.

The three stars comes from the service we received. The staff were very friendly and helpful, but ended up forgetting/losing an order a total of three times. It was a full house so the odd mix up would be forgivable; however, the repeat orders added a 40 minute wait and put a damper in the overall experience."}
{"text":"First thing that Han Ba Tang reminds us of - the hipster taco places on Ossington. A very hipster place - liking the interior since it's very different from the other Korean restaurants in North York.

My favourite was the spicy pork taco - it was indeed very spicy but I love spicy foods. Beer was especially refreshing when having this dish. 
We also ordered the kalbi taco and asparagus taco which was good but didn't stand out as much as the pork taco's flavour.
Service was great :)"}
{"text":"My friends and I came on a Thursday at around 6:30PM and managed to get a few seats rights away.

This is a small, cozy restaurant with really cute decor and a comfortable atmosphere.
My friends and I ordered kimchi fries and bulgogi. These dishes are packed with flavor and the portions for the kimchi fries are quite big. Pricing is a bit on the higher side, but the large portions of the kimchi fries made the price worth it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for my second visit. 

Spoon Pizza - mashed potato with tomato sauce, vegetables and lots of cheese. Like a Korean Shepherd's pie. I really liked the natural taste of the potatoes - not too heavy or creamy. Choice of bacon or kimchi - I got it with kimchi which comes on the side, not mixed in. I really like the kimchi here - crisp and not too spicy. 

The kalbi pan dish is tender, flavorful and in boneless bite-sized pieces. 

Pork taco was different this time - more pork but lacking the mayo and coleslaw that I like.

Seafood soup with ramen and spoon pizza are my favorites."}
{"text":"Its Korean food western style.  The creativity and fusion for this food was awesome.  I love this place.  The environment is a cute cozy very comfortable atmosphere.  Its a little romantic too !  Great for dates!  Price is average & food is great!"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly surprised by this place! It has a modern rustic vibe inside with some old school hip hop playing in the back ground. It's definitely a place to come out to on a Friday or Saturday night. They have daily specials and it has lots of space for big groups.

Service was great even though we ordered for take-out.

Meals are not the biggest but perfect size."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Delicious food, extraordinary interior, good music, fantastic service! I am planning to visit this place every weekend. Everyone who lives nearby should come here and enjoy! I strongly recommend spicy seafood soup with Korean style ramen :D"}
{"text":"This place seemed like a fusion of Korean and Mexican food and it was delicious. You know it's good when you have a friend who can be a picky eater, eat Korean food. 

The kimchi fries and kalbi beef were delicious and I would recommend it for sharing. The place was quite busy when we went, but luckily we made reservations so we had a table as soon as we arrived. 

Tip: If you sit at the table closest to the door, there's a charging station. Luckily, I was able to charge my phone as it was dying."}
{"text":"The concept: Korean food as tapas - served in a kitschy bar atmosphere.  Think Guu, but with Korean food.  As most of you know, most Korean joints sell family-style portions.  While traditional with most Asian cuisine / home-style cooking -- this is really not the trend now with everybody's unique dietary restrictions and glutton like me that want to try a bit of everything.

We had a pretty wide selection of their offerings and most items were solid.  The tacos were surprisingly good.  I say 'surprising' because everybody and their uncle is doing 'tacos' now to fit the trend.  It's easy to slap anything into a tortilla and call it a 'taco'.  But they use a spinach tortilla here which had a nice chew to it.

We also tried the baby octopus spicy mac & cheese, which was reportedly the 'spiciest' thing they had.  While some at the table were sweating and tearing up, I found the spice pretty easy to handle.  In fact, it was probably the least liked dish of the night for me.  The spice really didn't add anything to the mac & cheese and I found the texture really mushy.

So, you're probably thinking: \"How is tacos and mac & cheese 'Korean'?\".  It's a controversial word, but I guess part of the menu is Korean 'fusion' bar food.  'Fusion' - so controversial, I didn't dare start this review with that word as not to scare everyone away.  Regardless of your feelings on 'fusion', I think it appropriately serves the crowd, they have drink specials on most nights here and we were here during a Raptors playoff game and the place definitely had a college sports bar vibe (fries on every other table) to it despite the hipster-influenced decor and the craft cocktail available; there is a very familiar feel to this place.

So what about 'real' Korean food?

The pork belly (bossam) came with a flambe salt crust which was a really unique presentation.  I was told the pork belly is sous vide which explains why the pork belly was very moist.  I liked the kalbi jjim - a tad sweeter than I'm used to, but still a solid representation.

However, I will say that these dishes were $20+ so it does stray a bit into the 'family style portion' thing they were trying to avoid.  That said, it's a pretty good price point/portion size and it definitely amenable for sharing.  And definitely cheaper (and smaller) than the same dishes at a traditional Korean restaurant.

The service was excellent and the proprietor came by a few times to check in on us and was very passionate about her menu.

Typically, I dislike places like Han Ba Tang - places that try to be all-things to all people and a jack of all trades.  It's simultaneously a trendy bar/lounge (with the craft cocktails and infused soju flights), a sports bar (with the flank of TVs, drink specials and most patrons ordering fries/tacos/mac & cheese -- just missing nachos here), and a Korean tapas joint.

However, at the end of day, I like this place.  The owner clearly cares about her food and business, all the food has a very experimental edge to it and it's overall a fun atmosphere.  I still can't really pinpoint how to categorize Han Ba Tang - but I have a feeling I'll be back and try."}
{"text":"Celebrated with a group of friends here this past Saturday. A good place to grab a drink (it  seems like cocktails or flavoured soju are their specialty) but there is a limited amount of beers on tap. It's easy to walk right by the restaurant because there is no English sign out front and you need to peer through the window to see it. It's good idea to give a heads up to friends who haven't been here before or they will be circling around the block looking for it.

Once you get inside, I would recommend trying their tacos. The spicy pork tacos were good, plenty of meat but it tasted like any other cut of meat I would expect to find so it didn't set itself apart, The unagi tacos was more interesting. Definitely on the sweeter side and benefited from the hot sauce that was passed around the table. For sharing, the kimchi fries would be best. A large platter of well made fries (and some random tortilla chips??) covered with sauce, kimchi and optional bulgogi."}
{"text":"This is in my Yelp bookmarks,  im glad I added it.  This place,  as yelpers reviewed,  had no name.  We almost passed it,  but when I heard the loud music I knew it was the right one. I made a reservation for 9pm on a Saturday night,  place was packed,  but we were seated right away. The servers are goodlooking,  felt like I was watching a Korean love story.  They look like TV personalities.  it's  good to know that they all speak English.  Most of the good Korean places I've tried have servers who don't. 
I did my research from all the reviewsbefore coming over.  So I knew what to order. I had the infused soju trio,  vanilla,  citron and strawberry.  I can't pick one over the other.  So good,  I could have had 2 more rounds.  It came served with wasabi peas,  a nice accompaniment to the smooth drinks. 
I also ordered the kimchi spoon pizza, I can't have enough of it. The owner said customers always order the bacon,  I'd have to try that next time. 
I tried the spicy pork tacos,  3 for $10. The spice was perfect.  I gobbled it up too quickly. 
The sweet potato fries is also worth mentioning.  It's crispy (like tempura-crisp)  and was perfect with the wasabi mayo dip.  
I can't wait to be back. Oh,  and yes,  they have great customer service."}
{"text":"This is the second time in about 6 months I've been back to this restaurant. I've always liked the decor, the vibe, but once again, there were kinks in the dinner service. 

Some of the food I find is very good, like the spicy chicken dish (sans cheese) but some were just ok. I guess this is just how Korean pub type food is suppose to be. We had the Kalbi tacos, Lobster tacos, kimchi fries, tofu cakes with pork and we DID order the spoon pizza and were excited to try it, but it never arrived so we cancelled the order since we had to leave. 

The waitress also accidentally spill a drink onto my friend's plate full of food, and caused an awkward moment. What disappointed me was that we had to ask for a new cocktail and replacement food, rather than her instantly offering it up. When we asked her response was, I'll try to see if the kitchen will do it. (when I think the answer should have been of course!). This shows the lack of experience in the wait staff, despite the friendly service. I mostly felt bad for the waitress after this incident because she seemed at a lost at how to handle it. 

Good points: They have improved their drinks and cocktail menu, which would make this a top notch place for drinking."}
{"text":"Had the most terrible grilled octopus ever tonight unfortunately!! The octupus was said to be the \"last one of the day\" but it tasted absolutely stale and tasteless like chewing a cloth. And it was priced at $17!!! I will never go back!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Korean fusion cooking. Food is totally worth the price. Soju based cocktails are very refreshing - highly recommend Clean Cut with Cucumber, Soju and Mint."}
{"text":"The North York Yonge & Sheppard area is long due for a new place like this-fun and chill ambience, modern Korean bar with a twist. The fusion dishes such as kimchi fries and creamy rice cake are my favourite. But the rest are rather mediocre.  I was looking forward to the tacos, but they were cold and  not even warm (including the toppings). I tried the fish, lobster and spicy pork tacos-all served room temperature or colder.  Taco shell didn't taste good either, tasted kind of raw...not enough dressing and toppings as well.  Had to order the Korean spicy seafood soup to warm up after and that was decent.  Their menu selection were not much, I think I ordered pretty much everything on the menu.  The crawfish salad was recommended by the server and it was good but portion was small for $9/10.  Overall, the experience was good, came here for a gathering and we were able to stay for few hours on a Sunday evening. Not recommended for date night or if you're really hungry."}
{"text":"Came here on Sat and it's fully booked.  This place is more of a bar than a restaurant.  We reserved the seat at the front where it is spacious and comfortable.  We ordered lobster taco.  It was nice and crispy with decent size of the lobster tail but unfortunately one of the taco had a hair in it.  The waitress got us a new one without questions.  The taco lack some sauces tho.  We next had the kimchi fries.  It had a little kimchi spice in it but not too spicy at all.  It's ok but I prefer tradition poutine better.  Next dish was the seafood soup, it's very spicy but lots of flavour.  It's good if you can take the heat. Another dish we had was the kimchi korean pancake.  There wasn't much topping on it, just some bacon with a little spice.  The last dish we had was the chicken wing which was fried and split in half.  The wings are rather small, not much meat.  For drinks, we order the sangria.  Very good and fruity.  This place is good for drinks.  They have many selection on soju based cocktail and weekend they have some specials on drinks."}
{"text":"I've been here a of times last year and all the times I've been it was super busy. The vibe of the restaurant is very energetic but intimate. When it's busy they're playing upbeat music to match the atmosphere. My most recent visit, it was slower than usual but they kept up the relaxed ambiance with peaceful music and I didn't mind it at all. 

If you're stuck on the menu I suggest the kimchi fries! If you eat meat add bulgogi (I don't eat meat but my friends love it and get it on the side). The prawns are always good and they have a wide variety of drinks from cocktails to beers and soju! Calamari and soft shell crab wasn't my favourite but it's new on the menu to try. 

Would recommend for a night out catching up with friends or a casual date night."}
{"text":"Pretty live place on the weekends and Friday night. Place to be to celebrate your weekends and just chill with friends. 

Pretty average selection of beers but they do have other special korean alcoholic beverages as well. SOJU! 

The place is a bit tight when it gets really busy and there's not alot of room to walk around without bumping into others at times. But i guess just have to be more careful. Overall, is a pretty wicked spot to grab a drink. Also they have some pretty interesting variety of food items. I only tried the chicken wings, not bad but piping hot tho which is good. You know it's fresh to order. 

Good place, and lots of nice eye candy too ;)"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write a review for this place because the food is seriously so good. I'm a fan of almost everything I've tried and I've eaten here numerous times. 

This place is usually pretty packed even on a Sunday night. Good idea to make a reservation or take a chance and wait for a table. By the way, I love how they have plugs to charge your phones. That's a definite plus for me. 

My top fave dishes are: Kimchi fries, Creamy rice cakes & Mac gochujjang with octopus.

The best part is the spice and good flavours each dish has. One dish I would pass on is the bulgogi, which I thought was nothing outstanding. 

Service is pretty good, sometimes when it's busy it's hard to get their attention but the food makes up for it. Some of the dishes offer small and large, so this is the perfect place to share and try a bunch of dishes together. I think it's the best way to enjoy a night out with friends and enjoy one of the many cocktails, soju or beer they offer. 

I will definitely be back and I've already recommended this place to a couple of friends."}
{"text":"Fresh and Unique !

I came here one day at around 2 oclock on a weekday with my girlfriend. She ordered the three taco combo for 10 dollar and I had the Bugogi meal. The price was very reasonable and the size of the meal was enough for the both of us. 

The asian waiter with the circle glasses was polite and helpful. Im not quite sure why the girl in the comments below was so against her. In terms of the ambiance of the store, I felt that it was quite comfortable and chill. I loved the old songs that they played in the background and the unique decoration. 

The chicken taco was nicely flavoured and had a pleasant kick to it.The Kalbi taco was probably one of my favourite since they didnt skimp out on the meat as well. It was presented very nicely and very well decorated. I thought I wouldnt like the asparagus taco but I was surprised when I actually tried it! Such a nice texture and crunch. 

Just the previous day, I went to kensington market for a bunch of tacos. I felt that Han Ba Tang has provided something creative here! Id love to see alot more different tacos on the menu in the future. Maybe include some kimchi in some of the dishes too. I have a feeling Kimchi on tacos or pizzas wouldnt be too bad.

Keep up the good work! Id love to come for lunch anytime as long as the special is still up."}
{"text":"Surprised i didn't write a review for this place. Anyways this place is amazinggg! The food here is so good.. the tacos.. the rice cakes... the fries... the drinks. I'm telling you everything here is good! The only downside is that, it's quite packed and no one wants to leave. So best to reserve or come when there is no one, which is rare. I really like this place because of the atmosphere. Definitely recommend the rice cakes!"}
{"text":"Made a quick stop here for a drink and some food. Had the spoon pizza and kalbi tacos with an old fashion. The food was pretty good, but nothing to praise about. The kalbi meat was cooked and seasoned well but the rest of the taco wasn't that great. The spoon pizza tastes like the inside of a pizza pocket. 

The old fashion I had looked good but the taste was off. I have had plenty of old fashions in my time and this one would rank in the lower end of them. 

The locations looks amazing and might be worth a visit."}
{"text":"This would be my 3rd visit here.  First time was the best.  Second time was mediocre.  Hoping 3rd time's a charm.  
This time i shared....
- the waow bun: good heat, nice sweetened bao, pulled pork had great flavour, the nacho chips gave it a great crunch, loved the texture 
- a taco trio of unagi, kalbi & spicy pork: out of the three i liked the unagi the most...it tasted just like Peking duck!
- crispy king prawn: a little to spicy for my taste but my fiance liked it
- the spicy chicken with cauliflower dip: i likdd this dish. The cauliflower dip was really tasty and flavouring on the chicken and rice cakes were spot on.  Even my fiance who's a chef approves :)
Looking forward to next season's menu or new items!"}
{"text":"My friends and I made a reservation for 4 people on a Monday night. We were seated very quickly and the restaurant started to fill up closer to the end of our night. 

The decor is awesome -- refurbished roofing, coat racks made from faucets etc. It had a nice vibe, and the staff was very friendly. We had a new waitress and she was super excited talking to us about the food and drinks. 

My friends got pints of beer (good selection) and the Sona Colada. 

We got the kalbi tacos, and the spicy sauce was really nice. There is a summer special where you can get a variety of tacos. We also ordered the spoon pizza, mac and cheese with octopus, creamy rice cakes, and kimchi fries. All of it was superb! 

I can't wait to come back and try new dishes."}
{"text":"A pretty hipster Korean fusion place, all the waiters/waitresses there are dressed well haha.  Your typical Korean poster boys/gals.. or maybe just the ones I saw 

Ordered a sangria there, pretty standard.  Enjoyed the blood orange and went well with the dishes we got.

Menu-
Spicy pork tacos - I heard they were most famous for their Korean-style tacos, so that's what we ordered first.  The pork was fried with a very saucy breading that tasted Buffalo-esque but minimally spicy.  The mayo over the pork was slightly spicy, and the taco shell was very typical.  The coleslaw was alright, the raw veggie taste was particularly strong and contrasted with the meat in an interesting way.  I thought the pork was cooked really well and it's a very meaty/filling dish when you order in triples 
Kalbi tacos - The kalbi was seasoned EN POINTE.  Liked this more than spicy pork tacos  
Spoon pizza with kimchi - There was also a choice with bacon but we thought we'd just continue the Korean flavours.  The \"spoon pizza\" was made with cheese and mashed potatoes, no dough that I could taste.. Kimchi was inside with peppers, onions, etc.  I thought it was a creative way to make a pizza, would want to try this myself. May return to try their sweet potato chips :)

Updated*
-Sweet potato chips with wasabi mayo - Sweet potato fries in a big portion.. good filler for your meal on an extra hungry day; would taste a lot better if you were starving
- Creamy rice cake - I enjoyed this a lot even though it made me feel like I should go to Jenny Craig after.. cream sauce with bacon bits + chewy rice cakes.  Mhmmm.

Beef kalbijim -  Beef short ribs that were braised with such flavour and fall-off-the-bones good, recommended for juiciness and flavour :)"}
{"text":"I like this place!  Been here twice and for sure coming back again. The food is great and the atmosphere of the bar is good too.  I went here on two different weeknights and they always have daily specials.  Always full house but never overcrowded so you can take your time while hanging out.  

Over my two visits,  I tried some different food. On my first visit I tried the Kalbi Salad which was surprisingly one of my favorite menu there. I also tried Spoon Pizza with Kimchi, Crispy King Prawn and Black Calamari.  All of them were yummy!  The crispy king prawn was little bit spicy but tasted really good since prawn is my favorite seafood.  I also tried the Strawberry Inception cocktails.  It was pretty good and I didn't taste the alcohol at all.  

The second time I went,  I tried the same Spoon Pizza Kimchi, Kimchi Fries,  and the Spicy Chicken with with the Cauliflower Cream Sauce.  They were all great too.  I liked the Kimchi Fries and Spicy Chicken! I ordered the Sangria too and I loved it!  Having all these food for two people were so filling. 

It's a tapas style Korean food.  So,  don't expect to have a huge portion like the other Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"Ok... My first time here was fun and I had a few more drinks than what the average person would have.
3 stars has grown to 5.
Why? 
Kimchi Fries, pork tacos, fried prawns and $15 Sapporo pitchers (on Thursday)

(That's an off WuTang reference for this cool K-Town joint)"}
{"text":"If you have tried Kogi from LA that first started the korean taco craze don't expect that quality here, we got the kalbi, spicy pork and eel. The meat wasn't bad but the type of taco bread they used does not go well, and the toppings with it was just onions and green pepper, kind of bland if you ask me
We also ordered the black calamari which wasn't special at all, just grilled/bbq squid with some seaweed sauce for $10......

The place is nicely decorated and the servers were attentive, but just did not live up to its expectation of being a korean taco place, disappointed...."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews, but my time here was fantastic. I came earlier than my friends because they were running late so i got sat down at the bar and within 5 min i was helped. When my friends did come the server looking after us always checked on us and provided top notch service. Food was on point. I had the kalbi tacos and my friend had the lobster tacos. The kalbi tacos had great balance of flavours crossed between mexican spices as well as korean spices. The lobster taco tasted like a dynamite roll cross bred with mexican fish taco. The best part was the kimchi fries with bugolgi. The only thing was that the cocktails were a bit pricy but the beers were very reasonable. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This place has some really interesting and yummy Korean fusion bar food. The kalbi salad has super tender pieces of meat on top of a well dressed but refreshing salad. The creamy rice cakes, on the other hand, is very rich and satisfying. The soft rice cake smothered in Alfredo sauce with chunks of mushroom and bacon is comfort food done right. They even serve a small dish of pickled cabbage on the side to help balance out the richness of the sauce. The HBT bossam comes with pickled apples, garlic paste, kimchi raddish and a spicy salad to be eaten with the slices of porkbelly. Finally, the kimchi fries with bulgogi is a must have. Their fries are extra crispy and all the toppings come together amazingly. I can't believe I'm saying this but it just might be better than any poutine I've had. I've tried a couple other things such as the soup, pancakes, and the pan spicy chicken, but those were not as memorable in my opinion. 

On Mondays, they have bottled soju for $15. I really like the grapefruit flavored soju as well as the green grape ones. They are by far the tastiest shots of alcohol I've tried.

The service is a bit slow and the servers are not the most attentive, but once you do manage to get their attention, they are very nice. I really like the interior decor as well. A great spot for most occasions."}
{"text":"Great bar food. Not very traditional when it comes to Korean cuisine, but that's what makes it great. They've got a very western take on traditional Korean dishes, such as Kimchi Poutine, one of the most popular items on the menu. Staff were very welcoming and attentive. A fun place to hang out with friends, but a bit noisy during peak hours (hip hop noisy, not k-pop)."}
{"text":"Great crowd! The people here are really friendly once you're a repeat customer.
Prices are a little on the higher end but in this area it is much more appreciated since there is not much competition around.
Their seafood is really different from everyone else and the dress code is slightly more on the casual formal side so no hoodies unless its winter.
The ambience is very subdued and they have good music playing throughout the night."}
{"text":"Came by here yesterday with a big group for a gathering.  Han Ba Tang impressed me very much.  If I didn't have a little one, I would definitely be a regular here.

Pros:
Very unique menu items
Awesome service
Nice motif

Cons:
Seats are little close to each other

Like I said, I came by with a big group for a gathering after work.  Han Ba Tang has a ship motif going.  It looks like you're inside a cabin of a pirate ship.  A lot of these types of places don't seem to have enough light but Han Ba Tang doesn't have this problem.  The place is well lit and very inviting.  They have a table in the middle that easily fits 20 so a big group is no problem for them.

This place serves tapas with a Korean twist.  It's something unique and you don't see a lot of it around the city.  I ordered a lobster taco, sweet potato chips and kimchi fries with bulgogi.  All three were good.  I was surprised to see that the sweet potato chips were my fav of the three.  It was recommended to me by the waitress.  I've always had sweet potato fries so having it in chip form was different.  It comes with a cheese and cauliflower sauce which I loved.  The prices are right around where they should be for tapas.  Come prepared if you plan to order a lot.

One thing I need to note is the great service this place has.  The 2 waitresses working last night were super awesome.  Very nice and patient.  Along with who i was told to be the owner Dee, it was some of the best service I've ever had.  Dee is basically what you want in an owner of these type of places: nice, easy going and flexible.  He always provides a friendly atmosphere for his patrons.

My only tiny gripe is when the place is full, there isn't much room to maneuver.  I walked over to the other side of the table to talk with other friends, and sometimes I found I would be in the way of anyone trying to pass by.  It's very minor as most of the time you will be seated though.

All in all, I like this place a lot.  I will definitely be back when I get the chance.  This place in conveniently located near the subway so you can easily TTC back if you have too much to drink."}
{"text":"I was visiting from LA and this is the best korean suljib in Toronto. Great service, great drinks and excellent service. I want to thank the owner (Chai), bartender (Sam) and servers (Yuri and Julie) for the wonderful time I had at HBT. Kimchi Fries were wonderful, might be better than the one we have here in Cali. Blessings."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday and wow, it was super busy for a sunday night! If you do plan to go in a larger group, I'd recommend booking a reservation ahead of time. We were a group of 4 so we had to wait only 15 minutes. Wasn't surprised it was so busy though - the vibes, interior, $15 soju on Sunday and Monday, and food were great! The staff was also very friendly. We ordered soju and the kimchi fries. I wasn't even tipsy but the fries were sooooo friggin delicious!!! Very generous with how much kimchi and sauce they put on top, and the fries were delightfully crunchy and when getting to the bottom of the dish the fries are soaked with all that kimchi goodness. Would recommend this place and dish :)"}
{"text":"I review this place with mixed feelings. I've brought many friends to hanbatang for their wide variety of soju cocktails and interesting bar food. The way they incorporate many Korean favourites into the bar/tapas medium feels like a natural fit. Make no mistake, my friends and I all agree we greatly enjoy their food as well as the atmosphere of being in a hipster vibe cellar. The kimchi fries with the bulgogi is one of my favourites.


My gripe comes from the one visit my friend and I came when it seemed exceptionally quiet. At one point in our visit, we were asked to leave (well in advance of the posted closing hour). Their reason? It was quiet and slow, and they wanted to close shop early. I'm not aware if this is a standard business practice elsewhere, but came off as rather disrespectful to me. I hesitate to return, unless upon suggestion/insistence of another friend. Especially given there is a great surgence of other great Korean bar food options in the area."}
{"text":"New joint by yonge & Sheppard!!

Make sure to check it out! The owners & servers are extremely friendly and definitely make you feel comfortable!

Food is different but very tasty!!!

Kimchi fries with bulgogi is a killer!!!"}
{"text":"Always satisfied with this Bar everytime I come here.  I also like going to Menami down the street which is the same owner.

The Kimchi Fries here is probably one of the best I have had in my opinion. 

Korean places also have awesome fried chicken in general and this place is not exception.

Their kitchen does a great job at everything to comes out.

This place is always packed, has good music going. Great drinking and playful atmosphere for young crowds.

Lots of attentive young hot Asian servers, all around great Asian bar in the Yonge and Shepherd area.

Would recommend this place for a night out with drinks and appetizers along the way.

Well run business, keep up the great work!

Food and lots of drinks comes up to about $30pp."}
{"text":"I've been to hbt several times. I really like this place to go and grab a drink. They have a decent line of beers both on tap and bottles. Also they have their own infused sojus available which are okay, I still prefer to get a regular bottle of soju. Great atmosphere, everyone is nice and the owner really seems to care about her patrons. The crowd is generally younger I would say its 20-28. 

If you're hungry I would suggest the creamy rice cakes or the bacon kimchi pancake. Keep in mind the majority of there menu is tapas style. 

Its safe to say this is the gem at yonge/Shepherd. Very ambiguous store front with no huge sign so keep your eyes open when driving by."}
{"text":"After Nome canceled our reservation at the last minute, my husband scrambled to be yelp a place to have my welcome back dinner. He knows I would approve of anything fusion so when he described to me a restaurant with Mexican/Korean cuisine - i was all in! 

The restaurant was more divey than we imagined - bar-ish feel with great music. Place was packed on a Tuesday night and yet no one old than 30 was dining with us. 

After 16 hrs of work and travel, I was hangry. I literally wanted to try the whole menu but we later agreed to sharing 5. 

Spoonful pizza - sweet potato anything is pure genius. Instead of regular pizza crust, sweet potato purée as base. Loved the piping hot bacon tomato sauce with the oozy gooey cheese! 

Mr. johnson soup - tasted pretty much like a water downed Korean bean paste sauce with spam, sausage, canned beans, and elbow macaroni. I thought this dish was just ok - a bit too salty for me. 

Creamy rice cake - pillowy rice cake in Alfredo sauce along with pieces of bacon and mushroom. I could literally eat a whole bucket of this. Its richness was a nice contrast/balance to all the other heavier Asian flavored dishes. 

Lobster tacos - perfectly battered, generously portioned lobster tails with spicy mayo and fresh avocado slices. Delish! 

Kalbi tacos - similar to fajita - tender, juicy steak. As a seafood lover, I actually enjoyed these tacos more than the lobster ones! So good! 

Overall, Unique, tasty dishes with warm, friendly service!  With so many items I would love to still try on the menu, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went there with my friend. It's a good place! The atmosphere is not like Korean restaurant! It's like sports bar! Musics are very good and servers are also nice! I can speak English well, but they explained me about menu simply! I tried Grapefruit Soju for the first time! It's very tasty!"}
{"text":"Truly one of the best sangrias in Toronto. They give you a huge pitcher of sangra sans ice, and provides ice in a separate bowl so you get quality undiluted sangria.
They also have a more unique list of beers as well as mixed drinks.
The kimchi fries with added bulgogi also didn't disappoint. The fries tasted like cost co fries which are great."}
{"text":"Dinner here was so delicious, although everything we ordered was a little too spicy for us. They have a dedicated dinner menu which is what initially sparked out interested to eat there. Unfortunately that dinner menu ends at 8:30 so, if your planning to go in an try that go in before then.

The kimchi fries is probably the best there is. The server recommended we at bugolgi need to it and we did it was really good, the addition of course was $3.

Kimchi pancake was also very spicy, so if spice is up ur alley make sure to try that ! 

For the dinner special menu we got the cheesey porkbelly, the pork belly is a little too tough for me to eat but I would definitely go back and try the chicken instead! 

Service was quick and polite."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I've always enjoyed coming back!

I've always eaten at Han Ba Tang with a sizeable group, and each time my friends and I are always pleased with not only the service but also the delicious sharing-sized food offerings. From Korean-inspired tacos and kimchi fries with poutine to the fun \"spoon pizza\", each dish is reasonably priced and will leave you satisfied. 

The spicy pork along with the kalbi tacos are one of my favourites, followed closely by the bulgogi kimchi fries and the bacon spoon pizza. The spoon pizza is a unique take on a pizza/pasta dish, substituting dough for very thin slices of potatoes and LOTS of cheese, which you eat with a spoon (hence the name). The bulgogi kimchi fries are also always a huge hit with the group, as you definitely can't go wrong with a korean take on poutine!

The restaurant also has lots of drinks available and pitchers start at $16 from what I remember. Service is also very attentive and I've never had any issues with servers missing food/drinks.

One of the better late night joints uptown for drinks and food for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to bring a group of friends for some drinks and bites. Open late until 2am and theres free parking after 9pm close by. I really like the rustic look of the restaurant, it's very nicely decorated. Can get loud when it's busy. We ordered the spicy chicken with rice cakes. No fusion there. Comes in a sizzling plate and the portion was enough to share for 2. Don't think you can mess this dish up, just rice cakes, chicken, some veggies and Korean spicy sauce. So it tastes the same as in any other Korean restaurant. We also ordered the stuffed mushrooms which had peppers and kimchi in them topped with cheese. This was ok, but I was expecting it to be better. Maybe breadcrumbs to give it a crunchy texture. We also tried the spicy pork taco. Now this dish was delicious! It's $4 for 1 or $8 for 3. Good deal! I liked the sauce and cabbage with the meat and tortilla. I would go back just for that and try some other dishes. Menu is extensive. Service was quick and attentive."}
{"text":"Like some people here, we walked across the place, saw the sign for their daily specials and said, \"why not?\" The place has nice decor, awesome service (from Cindy), and some good music playing at the perfect volumn. Although there are restaurants around the area that has very good food that this place offers, still come by for their daily specials and very fun atmosphere. 

Go for: their daily specials (check out the pics), late-night relaxed hangout spot, fast service 

Don't go for: a quiet night out, the best food on the block"}
{"text":"Been meaning to write a review on Han Ba Tang for quite sometime now and have finally gotten around to it. 

I've always enjoyed coming here with friends for drinks as it is a local favourite of ours. The food is quite good but the drinks on the other hand, are down right amazing. The only place around the Yonge and Sheppard area with a good selection of beer (They have delirium tremens) and a great cocktail list.

For food I would always recommend the kimchi fried with bulgogi as it is something nice to munch on with a group of friends. If you want to try something a little bit more adventurous and the spicy side, try the Mac there! It's a little bit unconventional but it's extremely well made. 

As for the drink menu, there's always something for someone. For those with a sweet tooth, you chose the right place. Most of the drinks are on the sweeter side and extremely well thought out. I would recommend the strawberry inception, green apple and tom collins kim. For those with less of a sweet tooth, try the old fashion, live to 1000 or the Caesar on fire.

The drinks are complimented by the extremely friendly wait staff of Han Ba Tang. Staff are funny/unique people who give great service! I've always been treated well by them and always love coming back.

In essence, good food, good drinks, good people and great vibes.  

Tip: always reserve on Fri/Sat because of their bottle special!"}
{"text":"When Nomé is packed, we usually make our way to HBT. It's usually just as packed, but we seem to have a better chance at getting a table here. 

The menu is more like tapas style restaurant with sharable plates. Our go-to is the Kim chi fries with bulgogi. This is an interesting twist on poutine with tons of toppings slathered on. We also opt for the kalbi tacos. Be careful with the hot sauce, it does get a tad spicy. 

Music and ambience is very lively on fridays and weekends. Lots of people coming in and out and having a good time!"}
{"text":"Great fusion of Korean classics with North American bar food. Han Ba Tang threw me for a bit of a whirl, but after looking over the menu a few times, the challenge was narrowing down what I should order and not ordering everything I wanted to try. Trial meal included the unagi tacos, fries with spicy shrimp, and the fried crab & calamari plate. Everything was terrific, the in-house hot sauce that came with the tacos was more than notable, and made it's way onto everything else I ate that night.
The most appealing aspect about this place other than the food was the great vibe and the drinks. Lots of cocktails to choose from, and interesting selection of Sojus macerated in-house, and very cheap bottles of liquor. The music is good, the place is busy but intimate, and the remainder of the menu was calling my name. I'll be back to decimate the rest of the menu items, and I can assure you I will not be driving there."}
{"text":"dim, easy atmosphere & pretty decent food. 
Came here around 11 30 pm on a Friday & it was pretty packed. However, not a problem if seating only 2 guests. It's a little loud & the lighting makes it a bit difficult to see anything. But the service was pretty attentive & were all duper friendly. We order the triple kalbi tacos which were 5 stars & the kimchi fries with bulgogi which babe didn't really like. I found it OK.nothing really special just fries with kimchi & bulgogi so I'd say 3 stars. So, overall I recommend their tacos !!"}
{"text":"This officially goes on my list of favourite places in Toronto to eat. Han Ba Tang is the perfect example of Korean interpretation of western restaurants. I loved going to places like this when I lived in Seoul.

The food is all Korean-western fusion! I had the galbi & spicy pork tacos and a lovely bulgogi & glass noodles dish. It was delicious! The tacos are actually pretty traditional (corn tortillas, shredded cabbage) with delicious traditional Korean meat. It was a night of amazing flashbacks. 

Theres a great selection of drinks (mixed soju drinks, import beers, soju deals, and sangria) and the menu is always being updated. The staff and service is fantastic! I ran into one of the friendliest servers I've met in awhile.

Last but not least, the atmosphere in this place is fantastic. It also reminded me of a few underground places in Hongdae."}
{"text":"I had a family dinner yesterday evening and the food was amazing! I had the creamy rice cake and curry chicken wings. Both were extremely tasty. The decor was pretty unique and the whole atmosphere was fun and casual. Overall, a great restaurant to the Sheppard-Yonge area and I'm looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Great little bar. I gotta say. I don't come here to eat much. But was told their food is not too shabby. But as for atmosphere and drinks. I love it. Nice decor.  Good music.  And reasonable prices drinks. The only thing that I didn't  like as much would be the dungeon style washroom. If it must be in the basement. Maybe renovate it a bit. 
Don't drink and drive. Cheers"}
{"text":"My friend recommended the place and we finally decided to go. It's great atmosphere. Both of us love the food there. We ordered quite a lot and the bartender mixed good drinks too. However we don't know if it's the pay or just the waiter wasn't so happy working there. He wouldn't look at his customers that make me wondering...probably will go back for the drink and food but not the service.

----------------------------
So the owner wrote me a long message said they will improve on the service. I gave one star for that."}
{"text":"This place is really great and worth the hype!

I've been trying to get a seat here for months but every time we show up, we have to compete with the full house of reservations. The host was always really nice to us even when we couldn't get a seat so I was determined to keep trying! Finally we were able to get a seat within 10 minutes. We got water and menus right away and were able to order fairly quickly. They stop serving those sizzling platters with cheese wrapped around them at 8:30pm I believe, and we got there just in time to order the chicken one. We also ordered the gojuchang mac and cheese and the curry powder chicken wings. The menu consists of Korean and bar food fusion, they have items like tacos, mac and cheese and other bar favourites with Korean influences. 

The sizzling chicken plate came first and it was really fun to watch the cheese melt. A waitress came by once in awhile to stir the chicken and make sure everything was working properly. The flavours are fantastic on this dish. There's a bunch of nice treats in this sizzling bowl, chicken, potatoes, rice cakes, onions, and some other veggies. All this is cooked in a spicy/sweet sauce that's good on it's own but made so much better with the cheese and corn ring that surrounds it. This dish is super fun to eat, good for a group of people, we, as a group of 2 barely finished half and took the rest to go. The gojuchang mac and cheese was just ok for me, there was a flavour in there that I wasn't crazy about but there was a generous amount of octopus pieces and the sauce was really rich and creamy, I can't blame the restaurant for this, I think it's just my palatte. The curry powder wings came next and those were a real treat. Crispy, piping hot wings with a sprinkling of curry powder seasoning that was salty and sweet and so interesting that you just had to keep eating. I really enjoyed these wings and would definitely come back for the wing night specials. 

For such a popular place, it's nice that they still have daily specials on food and drinks to save a bit of $$ or just to order more food! I think pricing is reasonable here, it's really hip and popular place and they could be charging more just for the novelty of it, but I appreciate the down-to-earth pricing and I think the value is there for the good quality food, good service and really cool atmosphere. 

The restaurant is super hip and cool inside. House music blaring, low-lighting and a couple of tv's broadcasting sports make this place comfortable but cool. Definitely a step above the mom-and-pop Korean places in the area in terms of ambiance, this place focuses on food as much as it does atmosphere. Service is also great, water was filled regularly and the food came out quickly.

Of note: Customers who had no reservation but managed to get a seat, have a 2.5 hour seating limit. We had no problem following this but I guess it's always just good to make that reservation if you're planning on staying longer than that!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday, pretty cool bar atmosphere with fusion Korean bar food. The Kimchi fries were delicious and I enjoyed their Kalbi tacos as well. Looking forward to trying the creamy rice cakes next time.. They looked pretty interesting and almost every table had them."}
{"text":"I don't normally go to the North York area very often since it's so far away but I'm so glad that my friend introduced me to this place!! I have only ever been there past 11pm so I can't speak for how it is during the daytime, but the scene here at night is awesome! They don't have a huge sign outside so the place can be easily missed, but they do have a huge light up sign indoors right by the window facing the street. Parking can be somewhat of a challenge though sometimes and you'll usually end up parking on streets. 

The food here is absolutely delicious as well. My favourites would have to be the mac & cheese with gochujang and baby octopus and the kimchi fries (both $10 for the small). The fries could use a little more kimchi though since there's only enough to cover half the top layer. The sweet potato chips are a great choice as well since I can't think of any other place that offers them. 

Both the music and the people inside can be quite loud at times, but I don't mind that atmosphere at all. The fact that the staff are both friendly and good looking is also a plus ;) Just be sure to make a reservation if you plan on going late at night since the place is usually packed!!"}
{"text":"*3.5 stars

Its my second time going to Han Ba Tang with friends. One of my fave Korean bars. 

My group ordered chicken wings, mac n gochuchang and I had a peach beach. In my opinion, the price for the portions served are not really worth. The food were all pretty kind of spicy too (I was dying at every bite of my mac). My peach beach was made of peach liquor, soju, and vodka. I think this place is a good place to get beers and soju shots with friends. 

On a Friday night, this place gets loud! Even at around 1am, the waitress told us that it is usually more busy and the place more full too! Also everyone here working are attractive people lol. While not checking up on customers, some of then would take shots with regulars. 

The decor is also super cute."}
{"text":"Think it is also over hyped by this 4 star and social media. Had super high expectations and definitely not met. I'm from San Diego where Mexican tacos and fusion varieties are done right. This place is alright but for the price you really don't get much food. 

Had the lobster tacos, kimchi Fries, creamy rice cakes, spoon pizza. Nothing was Wow. Lobster tacos were good flavour and texture but too little lobster.  

Creamy rice cakes were good when they were hot, by good I mean decent and not Wow but after a couple minutes the everything thickened and hardened. Hmm.. 

The atmosphere is better than grand electric but now I'm craving for grand electric and bah mi boys. I would go check those ones out before trying here.

Servers were nice though."}
{"text":"When Han Ba Tang first opened, it got quite the buzz online in the Toronto foodie community. Han Ba Tang is a Korean Asian Fusion restaurant that transforms your everyday Korean ingredients into unique tapas. I went with one of my best friends and she was eager to try it out after I showed her BlogTO's article on it.

When we arrived, the restaurant was packed. There were no single tables left aside from the communal one. The communal table was a free for all and was empty when we got there. It didn't bother us that there might be people sitting beside us later. The restaurant had an extremely relaxing vibe and honestly was a cool place to hang out with friends to try some unique dishes. I shared the Spoon Pizza with Bacon ($10) and Kimchi Pancakes with Bacon ($7) with my friend. I enjoyed the Kimchi Pancakes with Bacon a lot more. It was crispy and made for a great appetizer. Since we ordered more appetizers than meals, the food wasn't filling. However, the price point was decent and I liked the atmosphere. I would definitely consider bringing some friends here again."}
{"text":"This place has the ambiance of a half bar half club. There's loud korean music playing in a dimly lit place with plenty of seating. The waiters and waitresses are nice but more interestingly all extremely attractive. 

The drinks are pricey at 10-16 for a cocktail and around $18 for a bottle of soju. There's a bogo shot deal on fridays though if you like hard liquor.

We also tried the dakgalbi with cheese and it was delicious. It's  $22 and plenty for two people. It's a steal if you compare it to kobi up on steeles where its like $40 for two people. 

The kimchi fries were more disappointing. Not as good as bao guys kimchi fries downtown."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place because of all the hype and pics on IG.

Dont really know what to say. Went to the restaurant at 850. Left my reservation details for 2 and gave my phone number and was told that the wait would be 45 mins long. Sat in the car for an hour and a half, received no calls. Decided to walk to the restaurant and wait there. Got a table in 5 mins. 

For my dinner I ordered the fish taco and triple spicy pork and kalbi tacos. The kalbi beef was decent, but the fish taco was so wet, the fish fell right through the taco dough. I finished and left the restaurant at around 11pm and I received a call from then at 1130pm saying my reservation is ready. Just made my night lol."}
{"text":"Came back to Han Ba Tang last Wednesday night to celebrate a friend's birthday. Restaurant was half filled and had 2-3 waitresses making rounds. They spoke Korean (mostly to each other) but also very fluent in English. 

The menu is extensive but I wish they'd have a more carb extensive section. 

I got the spicy seafood soup and it was great. There was soo much seafood in there that I definitely felt like I got my money's worth. There was a kick to it but definitely not too spicy to gulp down. 

 My friends got the spicy pork with the melted cheese and corn ring. Reviews given back to me was a \"not bad\" and filled them up. 
The baos apparently came with a spicy sauce that isn't mentioned on the menu. My friend had to wait for some time to \"cool her mouth down\" before moving onto the next bao. 
The nachos were bomb and had a lot of ingredients packed onto it. 

The main reason for the low stars is literally based on service. We had given our cake to the restaurant and I asked them to bring the cake out at the end of the meal. Mind you there's 4 of us in a little table with all the plates mentioned above. The waitress brought out the cake candle lit and just shoved the plates to one side. Which moved the mess by 2cm because our table was so packed. She went back to behind the counter to talk to her friend. R u d e. 

The food here is decent but you'll find better up and down Yonge with nicer service."}
{"text":"At my first visit I came to see what the hype was all about but wasn't quite amazed. I decided to come back for a second visit to give this restaurant another try, but I must say I'm still slightly disappointed. 2 of the items I wanted to order from the menu weren't available - I was so close to asking so what exactly IS available. The food here was nothing amazing yet pricey for what it's worth. Not to mention that both times i went, they have lack of staff and poor service.

SPICY PORK TACOS (single for $4, triple for $10)
This was one of the better dishes of the night. The taco skin was dry, no sense of being toasted as it was cold. The pork was thinly sliced mixed with some spicy sauce topped on shredded raw cabbage. It was good, but nothing special.

KIMCHI FRIES WITH BULGOGI ($10 + $2 for bulgogi topping)
This was my second try on the kimchi fries - it was good but didn't wow me. I would say not at par with Banh mi boys kimchi fries yet. I'd totally save my money and spend half the price at Banh mi boys for the kimchi fries instead. This restaurant is overrated.

KALBI PAN DISH - marinated beef ribs ($11)
I liked how the Kalbi meat was not tough and came with no bones, although at the same time without the bone does kind of defeat the purpose of it being ribs. I know it was a pan dish but I found it still too oily - the vegetables layered under the beef were soaked in oil. The dish was typical, mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Having tried almost all the Korean nightlife places in North York,  I can say this is probably one of the better ones to go to.  It's decor is very nice,  good choice of music and I love the very wide open window that reminds me of Korea.  
With that said,  the food is unique Korean fusion style and taste very good.
Will likely frequent this place often, looking forward to how the business will turn out and what other specials they will come out with. 
Servers are also very friendly,  so is Jason."}
{"text":"I was surprised with this one! This is a Mexican/Korean Fusion bar.

Firstly, it looks like a hole in the wall initially, but when you go in, it is pretty cozy, clean and decent decor. Its claimed to be bar-ish from my friend, but was acutally more like a resturant. 

Tuesday they had a drinks special. I had the \"Old Fashion\". It was a burbon/whisky with an orange peel. SOO good.

Easy eats = Try the Kim-chi fries and the King prawn. Simply different and awesome.

Tacos = Unagi and pork taco. Was told to try them all, so I will probably go back there sometimes soon.

Overall, recommend this place. Not only for a chill dinner night, but a nice date location."}
{"text":"I was very excited to finally try this place!
I'll get to the point.

It didn't disappoint, but also didn't wow me either. Their food items are unique compared to other tapas places, and dont get me wrong.. they're good, but not good enough for me to crave and come back for them.

CRISPY KING PRAWNS
best dish out of 3 we tried. Love the sauce which was a mix of spicy and sweet, and the shrimps tasted fresh and very crispy.  Definitely recommended.

KIMCHI BULGOGI FRIES
There was no wow factor when eating these fries. They used fermented kimchi which was good by itself, but didn't think it went well with the others. 

SPICY PORK TACOS
My least favourite... was the meat supposed to be cold?? I wasn't sure but that was a big turn off for me. 

Our waitress was attentive and friendly. Good service, okay food."}

{"text":"The moment I stepped into Han Ba Tang past the giant flashing sign I immediately felt I was in a cellar or tavern, with the brick walls, sloping ceiling, live-edge wooden tables, and caged lights. A very warm and trendy vibe. Service, though friendly, seems a touch slow, almost as if understaffed or conditioned to perpetually quiet nights.

One thing I've learned about HBT is that they love their soju. My previous visit here I had ordered a flight of their in-house soju infusions. What a great way to take the edge off or unwind. Beyond that, they offer some pretty interesting handcrafted cocktails of which many involve soju, and some very solid Korean fusion bites to match. Drinking and comfort soul food---what a great combo.

My friends and I ordered the creamy rice cakes, bossam, kimchi fries with bulgogi, kalbi salad, and of course, a bottle of grapefruit soju which was on special. The rice cakes were chewy and creamy, as if someone had made an Alfredo dakboki. Bossam was accompanied by an apple slaw and spicy radish---savoury and fatty, with tart and tangy crunch: delicious. Kimchi fries were a favourite here---attractively dressed from the bits of bulgogi with the perfect drizzle barely hiding the kimchi nested atop some perfectly crisp fries, a perfect partner for a nice beer or several shots of soju. The lightest of our orders was probably the salad, for which the kalbi was surprisingly tender.

All in all, a fairly easy recommendation."}
{"text":"One of my friends who lives at Yonge and Shepard told me about this place so I decided to try it out. I came here with my friend and we ordered a couple of dishes. First dish we ordered was the Kimchi fries (small size: $10) which was decent size for two people. What was great about this dish was that the fries were not over cooked and burnt. The toppings consisted of kimchi, green onion, gravy, kimchi mayo. The half crispy half soft fries was a great combo with the kimchi. One of my favourite kimchi fries I have ever tried.

The second dish we order was the spicy pork tacos. You can order 1, 2, or 3 tacos but the price for 3 was $10 dollars. They have other options for the tacos such as beef and even eel (might try that next time). Overall the tacos was really tasty and the pork was not too spicy. I did find that the proportion of wrap to meat ratio to be a bit much. The pork was not dry and the coleslaw was a good refreshing compliment to the taco.

The 3rd dish was the spicy seafood soup (large size with noodles). It was $15 for just the soup but we wanted noodles so we added for an additional $3 dollars. One positive was that there was a lot of seafood such as shrimp, crab, mussels, and calamari. I did find that the calamari was a bit over cooked because it was a bit chewy when I ate it. The soup had a nice level of spiciness which was not overbearing. 

The service was pretty good too. The waitress was making sure we were doing good and added water on a consistent basis. 

4/5"}
{"text":"Came here based on good reviews but it did not live up to the hype imo.  Ordered the spicy pork and lobster tacos along with some fried chicken on the side.  I would say their spicy pork taco was alright. Their lobster taco was deep fried and drenched in some orange sauce which overpowered the taste of the lobster itself.  The fried chicken was a bit disappointing for something so simple.  It was tasteless and there were some feather strands still attached to the chicken which disgusted me a bit."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends last weekend and we all had a fantastic experience here! Food was great and absolutely delicious. Menu items are quite unique so I highly recommend giving this place a try!

Service and Environment:
We came at 7:30pm on Saturday and surprisingly there was no wait time to be seated. Service was great but at times could be slow. It's a dimmed light restaurant with good music and an overall great vibe. It's definitely a perfect place to come with a group of friends because most of the menu items are definitely shareable. There is also a parking lot behind the restaurant which was really convenient since most of us drove. 

Food:
Tacos
Their tacos were delicious! I love how you have the option of just buying a single taco or buying three to share. We tried the Spicy Pork Taco, Kalbi Taco and the Lobster Taco. All tacos were exquisite and a reasonable size for their price. My favourite out of the three would have to be the Lobster Taco, SO GOOD. 

Spoon Pizza
My friends and I were a huge fan of this. It's basically mashed sweet yam and potatoes topped with an oozing amount of mozzarella cheese, mushroom and their home made tomato sauce. 

Kimchi Fries
This was another favourite from our table. Fries were really crispy - they kind of reminded us of those really good fries they sell at Costco! The toppings on the fries included: kimchi, house gravy, herb mayo, scallions. They added in just enough that it didn't make the fries too soggy. You also have the choice of paying extra to add in bulgolgi! There were also some surprising nacho chips hidden at the bottom the kimchi fries and it just worked haha. 

Overall a wonderful Korean Fusion restaurant with really good food and a fun night out atmosphere."}
{"text":"Everywhere I look on Yelp's reviews for this place, the word \"hipster\" gets thrown around a lot. I didn't realize how accurate this would be until I walked in, and see the marqee-lit sign, the live edge wood tables, the chalkboard menu, with a clipboard menu papers. \"Rusted\" industrial-style lighting. You get the picture. Oh, and pretty waitresses. And wall plugs to charge your phone!

I was shocked, SHOCKED, when the waitress came over and she didn't have thick black rim glasses with a beanie. But I got over my shock, and ordered a Kandy Krush cocktail ($9) for a fruity explosion of strawberry soju. My friend ordered a Clean Cut, which was cucumber infused soju ($10). 

For a table of 3, we ordered 5 things:

Spoon Pizza (Kimchi) - someone else said it...it tastes like the inside of a pizza pocket. And it's a \"spoon\" pizza because you really need a spoon to eat it. Mushy sweet potatoes and kimchi, quite yummy!

Rice Cakes - kinda like mac n cheese. I actually really liked this dish, nommy and cheesy - it's comfort food!

Black Calamari - just ok. Not crispy, but had a splattering of blackish sauce. Be careful with the red chillis, they are killer!

Kimchi fries with bulgogi - I personally loved the fries. It's covered with mayo, bulgogi, kimchi and generally delicious. The large comes out in a pizza tray kinda size.

Tofu with Pork Belly - um, pork belly on anything is good, tbh. It's topped with some kimchi and comes in a dish of 5. 

Honestly, the food would have only gotten a 3-star from me, but the experience and the decor got them a 4-star. Unfortunately, at about $40 per person, we were not full, and the BF required an order of nachos elsewhere to satisfy his hunger. So...portions are meant for flavour, not for fill!"}
{"text":"Was on my way to Nome and ended up stopping in at HBT instead for a change. Happy I did. It was early so I was the first customer. So obviously no complaints about service. I ordered one each of unagi (eel) taco, spicy pork taco and kalbi beef taco. All good and liked in that order (I.e Kalbi was least favourite and probably won't order it again). Also had the tempura prawn (was Wed night special - $8 for a solid portion) and seaweed rice. Prawn was fantastic. Rice was okay, served cool and somewhat bland even with the mound of chopped dried seaweed. Only complaint was some shell left on the prawns that was a bit odd. Waitress also didn't explain the menu. Overall a really tasty meal, cool vibes and good service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Finally got to check out this place after driving by so many times, wondering what was inside (they didn't have a sign up for the longest time!).

After some of the great Korean bars around ynf closed down over the past year or so (Turbo, Koguryo...) I was excited to learn that a new one had opened up, offering both an extensive drink menu, and a pretty decent list of food items.

We went around 7:30pm on a Friday night, and albeit very busy and a full reservation list, they were able to squeeze our table of two in (note: if you plan to visit, make sure you reserve!)

We started off with their famous infused soju. Very pricey (you get three shots of infused soju for $15 - for comparison you can get a bottle of soju is $6 at the LCBO, or a soju cocktail at other Korean bars for $15-$20 where they use a WHOLE bottle of soju), but great to try, at least once. We ordered the strawberry, pineapple and apple cinnamon at the recommendation of our server. They were all really yummy - tasted like sweet juice, with no alcohol taste (soju is lite to begin with). I enjoyed all of them, but because of the price point, would not order again. 

For food we shared two tacos (shrimp and kalbi), one kimchi fries (sans bulgogi - have no clue why we said no to the meat lol), and jjambbong (spicy seafood soup - we added the ramen). All the food was decent, but sadly all the items could have used a little bit of improvement. The kimchi fries were inevitably compared to Bhan Mi Boys kimchi fries, and sadly fell short. The fries were a tad cold, the kimchi sweet (whyy?? - kimchi needs to be spicy!) and I assume our choice to not add the meat had something to do with the disappointment of the dish (our fault - definitely order them with meat!). If they were to use spicy, cold (for temperature contrast) kimchi, and a sweeter mayo (this mayo was a bit bland), and ensure the fries are piping hot, the dish would be a hit. The tacos were pretty good, but missing something. They were basically meat, cabbage, and a sauce. They should consider adding onions/chili peppers/garlic for a kick and a bit of texture. The soup was my favourite dish of the night - perfect in taste and a ton of seafood - could have been served slightly hotter (temperature wise), but overall great ~

The service was really great (cute servers :) !) and all of them were very attentive and super nice, taking the time to explain menu items to us, and came to check on us just enough without being annoying.

One downfall was since they were so busy, we were told we would only have two hours at the table since it was booked later on and had to be out by 9:30 - this was no problem to us. We ordered a beer halfway through the meal, and ten minutes later the server came to told us we would need to leave at 8:30 (it was 8:20 at this point...). Having just received by beer, there was no way we could have drank it that fast. We were fine with being 'kicked out' since we were almost done our food (even though we were initially told we could sit until 9:30 - not sure what happened there), but they should not have taken our drink order if they were going to ask us to leave shortly after. Probably some kinks they need to iron out, being a new business and all, but another reason why you should make a reservation.

Overall it was a good night, with excellent service (minus the whole timing thing), and I will be back for a drink (maybe try one of their cocktails?) and try some different food dishes (the spicy chicken + fondu has my eye...) ~~"}
{"text":"If you haven't dropped by this establishment yet then you're missing out! This is not your typical Korean restaurant with the side dishes, bibimbap, pork bone soup, spicy rice cakes and... you get the picture. Their rice cakes are soaked with a creamy sauce with assorted vegetables and bacon. A bite of this savoury dish leaves you wanting for more! Definitely one of my favourite tapas here and I definitely recommend!

Oh, and did I mention their Spoon Pizza?! Mashed up sweet potatoes layered with vegetables, kimchi, bugolgi beef and cheese. Does not sound like your typical pizza but you still get that pizza-taste in your mouth. Not a fan of sweet potatoes? Not to worry. You won't even realize that it's sweet potatoes unless you're told. 

Their Honey Garlic Wings are superb as well! They're lightly battered served with a side of sweet potato fries and wasabi mayo. However, I was a bit disappointed with their platter of Kimchi Fries. I found it to be a bit too salty for my liking. Overall, the quality, portion and presentation of the food was exceptional!

I was very impressed by the service here on my very first visit. We placed our order before our neighbours placed theirs however, they ended up getting all their items on the table while we waited. A server kindly informed us that there was a miscommunication in the kitchen and offered us Polar Bear shots on the house. That was a really nice gesture that definitely reflected the quality of service here. However, the service was not as great for our second visit. The quality of service decreases when it gets really busy here.

Nonetheless, it's still a great place and I will be back to try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Was very crowded when we entered on a Friday night and I approached the hostess/server to let her know we wanted a table, she responded with \"sorry the wait is around 30 minutes, there's nothing I can do\". Well, I wasn't expecting her to do anything except put my name on some sort of wait list, which they don't really do. The manager often hopped in to get people to their tables.

Now for the food - oh wait, no on gave us our menus. We have to ask, but the table after us got theirs already. Wait what?

What we ordered:

Spicy Pork Tacos - 3 for $8 - Rating: 5/5 - Delicious. It's not too spicy and the flavor is spot on. The perfectly cooked spicy pork is balanced out with the sweetness of the cabbage and the tortilla. 

Spicy Chicken (L) and Fondue - $16 and $3 - Rating: 4/5 - The large didn't seem very large at first but after eating it, it was quite filling. We actually had to to take home the leftovers. The spicy chicken was also not too spicy and was mixed with cabbage, onions, carrots and rice cakes. I wish the chicken was breaded, but other than that it was pretty good. The fondue didn't quite go as well with the chicken as I expected. I enjoyed the fondue more with the rice cakes and fries. It had quite a pungent taste, which my friend compared to with blue cheese, but more like a Gorgonzola.

Sweet Potato Chips - $5 - Rating: 5/5 - The star of the show. These sweet potato fries were delicious. Thick cut and battered, fried to a crisp and served with an amazingly good wasabi mayo, far from the typical wasabi mayo you get at sushi places. The kind older woman at the restaurant refilled our wasabi mayo when she saw it was almost done, and I dipped just about everything in it.

Spoon Pizza - Sold out, more about this in service.

Kimchi Fries - $10 - Rating:4/5 - I honestly didn't think these were great, but my friend really liked them, so there ya go. The fries were covered in kimchi (obviously), a plethora of green onions and some sort of white sauce on top, all on top of a couple tortilla chips. The fries were thick cut and very crispy. I actually preferred dipping the plain fries into the cheese fondue. 

Service:

I feel like there was a lack of communication in the team here. The hostess/server would tell us just to wait, while the manager would jump in and tell us which table we were going to be seated at, and once he left the hostess/server would be confused on who's going where (I say hostess/server because she was most standing at the podium. There was another server just purely serving). The hostess/server taking our order didn't come with water, so the other server got us water, then both came with water. We also had to ask for refills many times and at one point my friend got fed up, got up, went to the utensil station and filled both our glasses with water.  
As stated above, the manager did a LOT of work along with the server, while the hostess/server did almost nothing. He assured us of our table and often checked in with us numerous times to make sure we were enjoying our food and our visit. I noticed he was very chatty with everyone and it seemed like he genuinely cared about the customers. After getting our tacos, spicy chicken, fondue and sweet potato chips, I asked him about our spoon pizza. What our hostess/server failed to mention to us after we ordered was that the spoon pizza was sold out, so the manager suggested the kimchi fries. He was also the one who got the bill, credit machine, and take out boxes for us. He forgot about the boxes three times, which is fine, it was quite busy, but what irked me was that he and was reminded by the hostess/server who was just standing at the podium (??). Also, while observing the restaurant, the hostess/server was bringing alcohol to a table and she took a shot of soju with them. Umm...What? How is this even allowed? 

Overall, the food was fantastic. I would give this place 5 stars for the food, but I'm taking away one star for the unpleasant yet pleasant service."}
{"text":"I love the vibe and concept of Han Ba Tang. 

A Korean Fusion Tapas bar where I can munch on Korean inspired sharing plates, have a Asian Fusion cocktails and catch a baseball, basketball and hockey game? 

A cocktail with ginseng inside? Drinking something that is tasty and with health benefit. I am in! Or have some tasty soju infused shots.

Tacos and more Tacos
Ramen Salad - refreshing
Couch Salad - Meh
Crispy Prawn - big tasty prawns
HBT Bossam - Interesting presentation but for sure a sharing plate with fatty pork belly
Beef Kalbijjim - interesting smokey presentation and so tender 
Jjambbong: spicy and loaded with seafood
Mac and Cheese with Octopus: so spicy and so very spicy

Highly recommended if you want to have a drink or 2 with friends and snack on Korean pub food! 

Daily specials, make sure you check them out."}
{"text":"This place used to be my go-to for taking friends and family out for a quick drink an some unique menu items. The food and drink is always on point and their variety of soju flavors kept me wanting to return. However, their hosting staff seem to get a little overwhelmed on busier nights. I've been asked to leave my cell # on multiple occasions and I'd usually wait at the Firken next door - the first couple times they were quick to call me and let me know my table was ready. But more recently, probably the last 3 or 4 times I've visited they never called - after an hour or two go by I guess they just assume you went somewhere else and don't follow up. This is the kind of thing that makes me hesitant to plan my night around HBT. If you can get a table you'll have a good time, that's a pretty big if on the right night though."}
{"text":"Han Ba Tang was on my list of places to go in a while and when my friend went for her birthday last weekend I was quite excited. The environment was cool, there was music in the background but not loud enough that you're not able to hear the people you are sitting near. I ordered the Peach Beach as a drink which was fairly strong so I would not recommend it if you want a drink that doesnt have a strong alcohol taste. My friends ordered some dishes to share.  We ordered Crispy King Prawns, Kimchi Fries with Bulgogi, Beef Kalbijjim, Spoon Pizza and I also ordered a bulgogi taco and a waow bun. 

Crispy King Prawns - These were delicious! I could eat it over and over again. It was $11 for about 6 prawns so reasonable in price. It was a little spicy but sweet at the same time

Kimchi Fries with Bulgogi - $13 The fries were really good. The bulgogi was also really good too. Although they were called Kimchi Fries, I didn't really like the kimchi. The best part is when the bulgogi sauce is all over the fries. Just so good! 

Beef Kalbijjim - This was a little on the pricier side since it was $18. The server recommended it so I was hoping that it was really good. It didn't fail to meet my expectations. The beef was really soft. 

Spoon Pizza - This was just sweet potato yam and some cheese on time baked. It was alright but not the best. 

Bulgogi Taco - I ordered a single bulgogi taco and I thought it was just \"okay\". It wasn't bad but it wasn't the best thing either. Would probably not order again. 

Waow Bun - Should've been called the Waow Bao instead! They use a bao as the \"bun\" and added pulled pork with coleslaw. It was good. I didn't like the perilla leaf with it though. 

Overall, Han Ba Tang is a great place to hang out with friends and grab some food. Looking forward to visiting again and trying other items such as the lobster taco!"}
{"text":"Really cool restaurant that serves interesting Korean fusion food. I love the vibe/decor inside, which is dimly lit, lots of wood furniture, mason jars everywhere, kind of hipster and laid back ambience. Great place to come with a small group of friends, since the dishes are tapas style and meant for sharing. It would probably also be okay for a date as well, since it's not super loud that you cannot have a conversation.

I went with one friend and we were lucky to get a table without making a reservation beforehand on a Friday night. We ordered a fairly large number of things because we just wanted to try all these things:

Sweet potato chips with wasabi mayo - We were both a little bit surprised when these came out, because really they are more like sweet potato fries fried in a tempura-like batter. For I think $5 the portion is actually pretty big and really filling what with all the batter and stuff. I thought this was okay but not really an amazing dish, basically it just tasted like sweet potato tempura but cut into a fry shape. I personally would skip this one, but will admit it's good value for your money if you are looking for a good snack.

Creamy rice cake - Mmmm I loved this dish. It's just those chewy Korean rice cakes cooked in some kind of creamy sauce with like bacon in it and comes with some pickled cabbage of some sort on the side. So simple, but it was so damn good, I couldn't stop eating it. I don't even usually like bacon, but this dish in general was not too salty, and the bacon really added to the sauce. 

Korean tacos - Han Ba Tang is well-known for these, so we had to try some. We got the kalbi taco and a lobster taco. To be quite honest, I actually wasn't that impressed with either of them. The actual taco/bread part I found to be hard and dry, and neither of the tacos really blew me away, so I was a little disappointed.

Beef kalbijim - This is like a beef short rib stew thing. The meat on this was phenomenal, the beef literally just fell off the bones, it was so soft and juicy, and the whole stew was flavourful but not overwhelmingly so. For a meat lover like myself, this really hit the spot.

I also ordered a cocktail, and although I don't remember the name, I know it was off of their special menu. The actual drink was kind of strawberry-ish and okay, but I have to mention that there was a giant blob of the most amazing cotton candy on top. I have never had peppermint flavoured cotton candy before but now I am determined to find out where I can get some.

I would definitely love to come to this place again! I will say that their menu isn't huge, so I think next time I would just come to grab a quick snack or drinks rather than a meal and try just a few new things or hit up some old favourite. They have a pretty large drink menu with many interesting and delicious sounding soju-based cocktails, so you can bet the next time I come here I will be sampling a few of those!"}
{"text":"KALBI TACOS were awesome! Although service was not that good, I would actually come back and have more Kalbi Tacos and try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with colleagues. It's finally nice to have something new in the yonge and Sheppard area. I must say the decor is quite unique and well decorated, as funky as it is; it's quite cozy. It was decorated as fish house with the wooden paneling and string lights. 

Our server was very sweet and on point. She did her best to communicate even though English is her not her first language. I settled for the chicken breast tacos. I also had the opportunity to try to the shrimp and pork. Chicken was a bit bland but it was a good try. The shrimp and pork were much tastier. The shrimp had a spicy kick to it with the Thai infusion of sweetness. The pork was well cooked and very tender and the it absorbed the flavors and spices very well. 

My only minuses were the incomplete bathroom. My hot sauce was sirracha.  This will do well in the y&s area especially with the young families moving in. I will definately come back."}
{"text":"From outside, you wouldn't know it's a Korean tapas place. Through the large open window, one can see their resto's name from inside. Better yet, found it with the exact address. 

The place has a rustic feel. Lots of dark wood on the walls and ceiling. A fusion of patio decor left inside. 

We ordered: 1. The kimchi fries which appeared like an Asian poutine. The fries itself was crispy and it didn't really get soggy which was a good sign. Not spicy at all. 2. We got three lobster tacos which it was a surprise to me that the meat was fried. It could have been fish and I wouldn't be able to taste the difference. 
3. Got the Pan Bulgogi dish which I found was the best dish since it's a traditional dish. Too bad it didn't come with some rice. 

Not happy: the service was a bit slow, but they did refill our drinks a couple of times. It can get pricey if you want to try many dishes. 

Verdict: the good was alright. The atmosphere can get loud with the noise level plus the music. I would only go back with friends or a special occasion."}
{"text":"Han Ba Tang opened up in 2014, and is one of the latest additions to the Yonge and Sheppard area. 

The restaurant may be unsuspecting from the outside as there is no signage. However, there is a large bright sign inside the restaurant and it kind of illuminates from the outside. The reason for the no signage is that the owner, Chae, wanted to preserve a rare Vitrolite tiling which was uncovered during the removal of the previous establishment's sign in the construction period. 

We started the night off with the chilli shrimp ($8) - lightly battered shrimp dipped in sweet chilli sauce, which arrived in four small dishes with 3-4 pieces each. It was dipped in a chilli sauce that tasted both sweet and spicy at the same time.

My favorite dish of the night had to be their kimchi fries ($8) with bulgogi (+ $3) - extra crispy fries topped with kimchi, aioli gravy, sizzling bulgogi and green onions. The small portion is $10 while the larger portion is $15. If you'd like to add bulgogi to your kimchi fries then it's an additional $3. The one that we got was the small and it was more than enough for the three of us to share. I loved how the fries managed to retain its crispiness even though it was topped with hot gravy and bulgogi. Additionally, there was a generous amount of fries and bulgogi, and in my opinion, worth the price. 

A fusion dish that we got to tried was the black squid ink pasta - squid ink pasta, mussels, with a house made gochujang cream sauce topped with Korean beef cake. The briny flavor of the ink pasta pairs rather well with the mussels, and the gochujang cream sauce added the Korean flavor to the dish. 

Personally, I have never heard or tried spoon pizza ($8) - mashed sweet potato crust with vegetables, tomato sauce topped with cheese and bacon or kimchi, before and I am glad that I did. Instead of a hard crust; mashed sweet potato is used as an alternative and works as the base for the pizza. You'd need a spoon to scoop up the sweet potato crust that is layered with cheese and vegetables. It was an interesting dish! 

The upper Yonge area is one of the quintessential haven for traditional Korean food. However, Han Ba Tang is a welcome addition to the area as they offer a more modern take on Korean food, and is sure to please the younger crowds looking for late night eats and drinks."}
{"text":"Just returned and I'm thoroughly impressed. 

It's a Korean tapas bar: my friend and I had the kalbi beef tacos, lobster tail tacos, spoon pizza, and kimchi fries with bulgogi. 

We liked both tacos a lot (I preferred the lobster, she preferred the beef, which was kind of a sweet beef). The spoon pizza was OK, kind of tasted like pizza without the dough. We both really enjoyed the kimchi fries with bulgogi; they disappeared fast despite us being full already. 

They serve many different kinds of cocktails with flavoured Soju, I enjoyed mine (forget which kind). 

Atmosphere is rustic decor (exposed brick, rusted wood along the walls) with low intimate lighting. A great place to either share apps with some friends or maybe a date. 

Will definitely return sooner than later."}
{"text":"Love this place! This is my go to place for drinks. I wish they had a  better waiting place though to be honest. Love the clean cut drink and kimchi fries."}
{"text":"Service:
This place is usually packed. I would suggest making reservation before going. Despite of that the staff were welcoming and quick to service me.

Ambiance:
If I have one word to describe it......Hipster-Korean. 

Food:
Overall, the food was great. It's mostly tapas style menu. So it's good to go with a bunch of friends and try an assorted number of items."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite places to come for drinks. Absolutely love the atmosphere and the cocktails are amazing!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  My girlfriend and I decided sample food from here. I have walked by here tons of time and most every time they are packed. So why 2 stars:

Place was nice, got that young hip thing going on. Waitstaff nice and efficient. No complaints there.

Big thing was the food. So we ordered the tuna tartare. $12 for 4 pieces. Our waiter did mention that they were small but omg they were indeed tiny as you can see from my picture. The chip that the 3 pea size tuna sat on was as big as a loonie. I know tuna is expensive but that is just robbing people and it wasn't even tasty. Maybe cuz it was too small to taste. 

We also had the unagi taco and that was good. Still nothing spectacular but flavours were fine. Some tiny bones in the unagi but that's normal. 

Next to the room temp borderline black squid dish. Really did not like it. Tasted too fishy not ocean fresh but fishy and didn't like the serving temp of that dish. Maybe it is just me who doesn't like room temp seafood.

Last item was the chicken wings. Sadly wasn't flavourful. We didn't finish the last 2 dishes. We both had a drink each and the bill after tax and tip came close to $90.

Wasn't worth that money. Sorry for the bad review. I had such high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"It was my first visit at Han Ba Tang yesterday with my friend. As a party of two we were seated and it wasn't very busy at the time we arrived because they had just opened not too long ago. When my friend and I began to order, the waitress said, \"oh that's a lot of food\". We also ordered the Pork Ribs with cheese which was served on a hot stove. We knew that it was a bit too much food as we were planning to pack some away, but wanted to try a variety of what is on the menu. My friend and I proceeded to ask whether they needed to relocate us to a larger table, which was completely fine with us. Then the waitress said, \"well.... if more ppl come with larger parties then we won't have anywhere to seat them. So we started to suggest, that if the kitchen can make the food slowly or wait to serve the order then it would be fine as we were not in a rush. She began to say well, the kitchen just makes the orders as they get it. Then she started to tell us that one of the dishes we ordered is presented on a large plate but the portion is not very big. So then I suggested if they can place that dish on a smaller plate, we would be ok too. Then she began to say that she thinks it would be ok because the tacos usually come out first and the tako wasa as well. Thinking in my head.... yes, because they are usually starters and takes less time to prep and make. But any how when they began to bring the dishes to the table we felt that we were rushed and stressed because we needed to eat quickly in order for them to clear the plates to have room for the other dishes. Servers were also not very attentive.

Long and the short of it, the waitress there lacks experience and some common sense (server could have told us that she can place the orders that we really want in first and come back to see if we really want the rest of the food that we were going to order and place it in later). The fact that the server was brainstorming out loud and letting the customer know that it is an issue for them to order a lot of food and basically passing the ball to the customer to resolve their issue is not very professional and leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

The food itself, however, was really not bad. Pretty good. The decor was nice too, although the chair that I was sitting in felt like it was an antique and about to break; they were using different vintage style chairs for their restaurant.

No matter how good the restaurant makes the food, the quality of service can make, or break the experience."}
