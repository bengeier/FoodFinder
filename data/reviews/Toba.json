{"text":"This is a brunch only review - Toba also serves weekday lunch and dinner however I have not tried either.
The brunch at Toba cant be beat. I travel from the west end to the east just to have brunch served up the way I like it.
Decor - the restaurant is typical of the area in that it is a long and thin room and does not have a lot of tables. Up front there are 3 tables that look out onto the street, followed by the bar area (which has some seating), then followed by the majority of the tables stretching to the back where the kitchen is. One can see the cooks working their magic in an open kitchen environment. The decor is simple and clean, the tables sturdy wood and covered with a clean paper tablecloth changed after each meal. Lovely plates and cups and solid silverware.
The staff at Toba are amazing. You get solid attention when they come see you and every time I have been, they have been very helpful with the menu items. The first thing up is of course the drinks. They make amazing coffees, teas, fresh juices, and are well known for the caesars (although at $9, I find them a bit pricey).
Do yourself a favour; make sure you order one of the scones. They are made on the premises, and come on a lovely tin plate with a dollop of fresh cream and homemade jam. To die for! I always split one with whoever I am with, as it can be filling.
The menu is fairly limited, but everything they make is done to perfection. I am a fan of eggs benny and they do all of the various types (florentine, veronique, etc). The wilted spinach with aged cheddar on chipotle bread is my fav. It comes with large chunks of roasted potatoes, and several chunks or slices of fresh fruit (pineapple, melon, strawberry, etc).
There is always a fresh tart (both a meat and vegetarian option), which comes with the same sides. One can opt for a typical breakfast (2 eggs anyway you like, roast potatoes, side of fruit, salad). 
There are also omelets, steaks and various lovely sides.
The price is totally worth it in my opinion. I dont find it expensive and usually spend about $20 including tip. If you have a special coffee or something to start, it will cost around $25 per person, but everything you get is top notch and prepared so well that you will leave totally satisfied.
I love Toba Brunch!
p.s. I was just asked below if this place is good for kids; I would say this: If your kids are well behaved, then yes, bring them along. If they are little brats, then no, of course not. LOL
Sorry, had to say it. I have seen lots of families that have little kids with them at Toba and they have all been well behaved kids..."}
{"text":"Great place for romance! The intimate atmosphere and attention to service makes this a perfect place to celebrate a special occasion or impress that certain somebody. This is also a place you can actually have a lovely conversation during dinner.

DINNER: My favourite things to eat here for dinner are the daily special risotto and gnocchi. The goat cheese salad (sans nuts for me) is particularly delish too! They lose a star for the sometimes-lacking vegetarian options. If there isn't a veggie special or two, you're kind of SOL. Donnie loves the red meat here, particularly when it's steak. Their Angus striploin (part of their regualr menu) is one of his usuals.

They serve homemade ice cream and gelato, and they are definitely worth a try! Otherwise, we haven't ventured into the dessert world here.

BRUNCH: Only been here once for brunch, but it was DELISH! Great upscale cuisine at great prices. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the bluberry pancakes! Unfortunately, they are only open for brunch on weekends.

I have to mention their amazing understanding of and attention to allergies too. I feel extremely safe eating here because they took my nut allergy very seriously. They knew the difference between peanuts and nuts and made sure I was well-informed about their kitchen/food.

It's a small place with a small menu, but it's a chef-focused resto with a wonderful vibe, great service and pretty darn good prices!"}

This place is great! very classy and great prices. I ordered \"The big tony\"
3 Eggs Scrambled W/Bacon & Smoked Trout, Served W/ Organic Greens, Home Fries, & Toast and for $14 Canadian, that's a deal!

Their menu is limited and I get the feeling, they may not have a huge selection but what they do have, they do it well because my meal was above my expectations.

It's a classy joint, great place to bring a girl and if you are a girl, it's a great place for a sex and the city type get-together."}
{"text":"Another one of favourite local spots, primarily for their weekend brunch. Can't beat rolling out of bed, crossing the street and settling at Toba for brunch with the paper. 

Breakdown of my 4 stars: 

5 stars for weekend brunch: Having had everything on the menu, you just can't go wrong. Every day brings with it a daily special omelette and tarts (they're actually quiches, veggie or meat) which are always worth a try. And for those mornings that seem to blend seemlessly with the night before, give their specialty Ceasers or Bloody Marys a try. They're based on in-house infused vodka and go a long way towards both waking up your taste buds and stopping that pounding in your head.

3 stars for dinner: It's ok, and the small intimate atmosphere has some appeal, but you can do much better for the area and the price."}
