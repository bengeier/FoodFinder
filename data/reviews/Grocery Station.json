{"text":"Amazing sandwiches with fresh bread and sandwiches. Your paying just a little more for a sandwich that is 100 times better than Subway. The owner could not be any more friendly or focused on his customers. Get the banana bread!"}
{"text":"Great little place in a great neighborhood. Visit here once or twice and you'll be on a first name basis with the employees. Every time I go there its a friendly atmosphere. They have a great selection of wine and some great local microbrews as well (that always seems to be ever expanding - which is awesome). Excellent deli for sandwiches or cold cuts too. This is my go to shop when I need some beer, wine or deli goods or just a snack in general. I'm moving soon and I'm bummed I cant take this place with me!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, great egg sandwich. They will make your food however you want. If they had a grill I would go there everyday."}
{"text":"We enjoyed excellent roast beef sandwich and tuna salad and the service was great while killing time before going to the Frank Lloyd Wright campus/House.   If we lived in the area we'd be back often!!"}
{"text":"this place is a hidden gem, delicious food with high quality ingredients. Great breath of fresh air from all the chains and brands, feels like dinner at grandmas house in wisconsin after a days work out on the farm.  the beer selection is also great, you will always leave very satisfied, a place you could go to every day."}
{"text":"Thurman Nurman told me about this place and he said they could make some good sandwiches so I agreed to go there so he would stop asking me \"Can I fix you up some sandwiches\", I must say what is that very tangy sauce that they put on their sandwiches? Other then that I found this very satisfying, I will tell my friends Kenny and Stan about this place."}
{"text":"My family has been going here for forever and we love everyone that works here. There sandwiches are so amazing That i normally have to have one at least once a week. They also have great beer and wine section. Also they have killer breakfast sandwiches which I did not know about until recently."}
{"text":"Happy to learn about Grocery Station!  I am a 12 year community member of Scottsdale and have found a great, honest deli style sandwich.  I purchased a turkey sandwich to-go that was 5 stars.  My four star rating is because the decor and aesthetics could use some degree of upgrade to bring it toward Scottsdale standards; and let's face it most things have room for improvement.  The pros are that it is a good sized space and the people are GREAT!  I have no doubt that this business and its owners will be there as long as they want to be.  The convenience store type products are well chosen and maintained.  I will return!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Sandwiches, and very friendly folks.  The grocery station crew is outstanding!!!!'"}
{"text":"Great people working the market, always friendly and helpful. The deli section has a wide variety of delicious sandwiches and side dishes. Marty, the owner, is almost always in and is always a pleasure to talk to."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches. I get them once z week. Fresh bread fresh meats and vegetables every time. More importantly,  no matter how busy they are, great service and handmade food."}
{"text":"Love this place. They make great Boars Head sandwiches!  Nothing fancy but that is what makes them great. And their macaroni salad & cole slaw are worth getting as well. Want a quality sandwich & side for a good price?  Hit this place!  Or grab a couple for a quick & easy picnic in the park. Staff is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"This gentleman named Thomas helped me. He was very pleasant and made my sandwich perfectly. Great customer service!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. My friend introduced me to this place and I think its one of the best sandwiches I've had in awhile. They bake the bread in-house and the sandwiches are so fresh and so delicious. I used to work in the area and would want to have lunch here at least a few times a week but now I work way too far to stop by for lunch. I miss this place so much!!! If you are in the are you have to stop by and get yourself a sandwich."}
{"text":"From the outside it looks like just an ordinary corner store, maybe not a place you'd plan to get lunch from, but I would suggest giving it a try. I'm not much of a sandwich person but I truthfully crave their food quite often. The sandwiches here are always tasty and fresh, plus I really really enjoy their macaroni salad. I'll stop by for a mini cup of macaroni salad for .75 cents. So worth it. It's hard to find sandwich spots that make quality sandwiches and a good Italian hoagie, so I'm very happy I introduced myself to the grocery station."}
{"text":"If you're on this side of town and looking for a sub sandwich or quick snack, this is a great locally owned store to stop into.   Everyone working the counter, either the young kids or the owners, is always so gracious about answering your questions about the menu and giving you good service.  Just got a sub sandwich here and some delicious gluten free Rice Krispy treats and oatmeal cookies on my last stop. Everything tasted good and was priced so reasonably. If you have time to sit, there's also an adequate seating area for you to enjoy your meal.  Why go to Subway or a chain sandwich shop when you have a nice place like this?"}
{"text":"We are snowbirds from Minnesota. We come for the month of March and stay at a friends house a couple blocks from the Grocery Station. They have everything you might need from a convenience store plus great sandwiches (especially breakfast) and a super friendly and helpful staff. So glad this place is so close."}
{"text":"Started going here because of all the 5 star reviews we saw.  Tried the croissant breakfast sandwich which is excellent.   They even make the croissants fresh daily, not some frozen breakfast sandwich. Everyone there is very friendly.  Now all we have to do is call in our order and it is ready when we get there, love this place."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are freshly made upon order and there are many different sandwiches to choose from. I liked the Italian sandwich. They also have a variety of snacks, inexpensive drinks, and fresh baked cookies. There is also a large alcohol selection and they have a small freezer of ice cream."}
{"text":"Great local stop.  Marty is great!  Good food, friendly service.  Just perfect. The prices are good and the selection of items is good too!"}
{"text":"We've lived in Scottsdale Ranch for 25 years. Thanks to Yelp reviews, we are now regulars at this fantastic locally owned deli we wouldn't have otherwise known about.  Why go to a chain when you can get a tons better sandwich with tons better ingredients on homemade baked bread!  From great people providing great service.    Their breakfast sandwiches are as delicious as their lunch ones, too. Bacon, ham, eggs and cheddar on their freshly baked bread is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Convenient corner market has everything you need! Friendly service, reasonable prices, and most importantly really good sandwhiches.   The owner is one of the friendliest guys you'll ever talk to.  Beer selection is diverse and reasonably priced.  Sandwhiches are amazing.  5 stars all day!"}
{"text":"This place is a true gem, just like their original store! Both locations are owned and operated by brothers from Detroit (repping the Red Wings will get you bonus points at the store lol), and this place is the classic old-school neighborhood convenience store - a rarity nowadays in our corporate world. Imagine if Cheers the bar, was a convenience store; this is it. The staff know most people by name as they walk in! And don't be surprised if you find some celebrities like Shane Doan or Kurt Warner in there sometimes. Why? because of the amazing sandwiches! Sure the store has a good selection of convenience items - snacks, toiletries, newspapers, some groceries, and a large selection of wine & beer etc... things you would find at Circle K, but what sets the place apart are the sandwiches. The store has a small deli inside, and they make some of the very best subs and sandwiches in the valley! SO GOOD. They bake their own bread daily. All meats are quality. The way they assemble the sandwiches is true craftsmanship. I have eaten there countless times, and not once was disappointed with what they made me. My favorites are The Shane Doan (not on the menu, but its a glorious roast beef melt), the Beefstrami, the Caesar chicken (so refreshing!), and my girlfriend is addicted to the Double Play turkey on rye. I cannot emphasize more how tasty their sandwiches are and how welcoming the owners are! I even consider them friends now, they are that cool.  So, if you live around the 101 & Frank Lloyd Wright, near Cactus/Shea.. there is no reason to shop for conveniences at any other place! You will be hooked on their sandwiches!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. Fantastic sandwiches, nice selections for beer. The staff is very nice and courteous! If you around the area, stop on by."}
{"text":"Drove by this store for ten years. Finally stopped in for a sandwich and it was great! Will definitely be stopping often from now on."}
{"text":"This is a great place to pick-up a freshly made deli sandwich. They use high quality Boars Head meats and make their own sub rolls. The sandwiches are always fresh and delicious. Service is quick and super friendly. A great sandwich stop."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great sandwich or anything in particular you must stop here. Marty is down to earth and a wonderful human being. Great local convenience store for all those things that you want to pick up without having to go into the grocery store. Definitely try the Reuben sandwiches and also the meatball sandwich they are amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome mom and pop style convenience store. Fantastic sandwiches! Could easily grab lunch here daily! Italian or meatball subs my fave! Great spot!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Beautiful sandwiches and beautiful people. Great neighborhood store amazing wine and craft beer selection which keeps on growing. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Half the reason I love the house I bought is because it's basically walking distance from this place. Mary, the owner is a pleasure and he always knows what items I would pick out so I don't even need to go to the store myself I can just send a friend and tell him to tell Marty to grab \"Kelly's wine\" The beer/wine selection is good and the sandwiches are the best in town!"}
{"text":"Small family run deli that has delicious sandwiches at a very reasonable price. They use Boar's Head (yesssss!) and the bread is super fresh.  The guys who run it are friendly and we love ordering sandwiches from here when we are on the go."}
{"text":"Back in high school my friends and I would always hit up the corner store on our way home and that's where memories were made. I stop by the grocery station almost everyday still after all these years. Marty and his crew are some of the most welcoming and kindest people you will meet. They have Boar's Head meat on the menu which gets two thumbs up! Their deli selections are always fresh and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I always get there Greek salad with added chicken and avocado and balsamic and hands down it is one of the best salads I've ever had. Their chicken is delicious full of flavor, everything they use on it is FRESH, and the portion is huge, definitely worth the low price!! I love them and the service is amazing!! These guys are good!"}
{"text":"I have lived down the street from this place for about 20 years, and have driven past it thousands of times. After seeing that they were listed on several delivery programs and tumbling across their Yelp reviews, I figured I should check them out.   Seriously, where have you been all my life? How have I never tried this place?? For the price of a Subway sandwich of questionable meats, you can get a high-quality? sandwich. Seriously, I am blown away by? how they can take a simple sandwich and make it so enjoyable.   Stop thinking about it. Just go here. Seriously. Just go. Stop reading this, put down your phone, and go."}
{"text":"Can you say excellent customer service and beyond delicous sandwiches! The owner Marty is kind and always has his customers best interest at hand! His staff is absolutely amazing too! Everyone is helpful and truly caring towards their customers! Way to go Grocery Station Team!   Keep up the good work!   Xoxo,  Foxy"}
{"text":"Awesome place. This place is a hidden gem of a sandwich spot. From the look of it, you wouldn't expect this to be a sandwich place or a deli. Has the feel of a gas station, but wow will you be surprised. The staff are incredibly friendly people who notice those that come in regularly. The sandwiches are great. Definitely try the Italian sub & the macaroni salad. Fantastic."}
{"text":"I have lived here over 20 years and seen owners come and go; some better some worse.  Marty and his crew are phenomenal.  It's always clean, everyone is always nice and the sandwiches are delicious.  A great corner store!"}
{"text":"Small deli in a grocery store on via Linda. Makes excellent breakfast sandwiches. Sandwiches are made fresh to order. Bagels are fresh. Owner is extremely friendly. Feels like a NYC style mom and pop shop.  No frills or fanciness. If your looking for a nice egg sandwich on a fresh bagel. This is the place."}
{"text":"Good food low prices on the sandwiches an beer and Marty and the staff are fantastic u"}
{"text":"I have known this family for a few years now.  They are so friendly and kind. They make sure that when you walk in they greet you with your first name.  I have very high standards when it comes to customer service and these guys reach it hands down. Sandwiches are great. I love this place. Thanks guys for opening this location so close to my home."}
{"text":"Love the Grocery Station for a great sandwich! It is our go to Friday lunch for our work team. It is locally owned and operated and the owners offer wonderful customer service. Always a pleasure to make our traditional Friday trek there."}
{"text":"4 of us had lunch here and the sandwiches were  delicious .  We had the meatball and Italian subs and were very pleased with both.  The staff was friendly and pleasant.  The side salad was homemade as was the cookies."}
{"text":"I love this place. The sandwiches are fantastic and the staff is awesome. I love how they know just about everyone who walks in the door by name. I aspire to be on a first name basis. It has a Cheers feel except with sandwiches."}
{"text":"Forget any of the other sandwich shops, this is the place. They have the best sandwiches in town and the employees are awesome. Any quick things you need can be had here and the owner is super friendly. I tell everyone to get their sandwiches here.  Oh and the fresh baked treats, yum. I can't go here without grabbing a Rice Krispie treat"}
{"text":"Old school convenient store. Sandwiches are fantastic. Prices are even from the past. Owner operator makes the sandwiches himself."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches.  Thin sliced, fresh, family recipes on fresh baked.bread.  Marty is the epitome of your local freindly small business corner store deli owner.  We are privileged to have him as  part of our community!"}
{"text":"It's located in a convience store! I thought it was going to be super sketchy but the guy behind the counter assured us we were in the right place. Food was great and we paid after we ate. Because it's a little place there isn't much seating but we had a cute little table for 2. Got the philly cheese sandwich with chicken not steak. Amazing."}
{"text":"The best. I missed the East Coast markets where you could run in, get a newspaper, a gallon of milk and a lottery ticket. No more. This place is great. Plus the sandwiches are amazing and huge. Great selection of beer and wine. Put this one on your regular rotation if you are in the area."}
{"text":"We wanted to find a good sandwich spot. This is perfect no frills good quality sandwich made just the way I wanted it. I plan to use this place for Togo pickup.  And really look forward to trying the breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"Stopped in since I'm new to the area to buy lottery tickets. Walked out with lottery tickets and the best tasting Sam-witch I've had in a long time. The bread just melted in my mouth. The fresh meat and vegetables making my mouth water and my tummy happy. Glad I stop I'll be coming back. Thanks for a great experience to. Great friendly people as well."}
