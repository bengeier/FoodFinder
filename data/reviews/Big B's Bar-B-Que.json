{"text":"Stopped at this place on my way home from work and grabbed a half rack of ribs and chicken strip snack for my wife and I. Ended up eating all of it except for a bite of the chicken strips my wife stole when I wasn't looking. Ribs were good, chicken strips were the best I've ever had! Sides were good as well. Very generous portions. Will definitely go back and try everything else they have. Don't be put off by the plain appearance. Also it's carry out only, but good luck making it home without getting into the box first."}
{"text":"Our 1st visit was last week. The sauce is good and gets better as you consume more of it. Gives you a spicy kick on the backside. The ribs were juicy, very tender and the meat melts in you mouth.  We will be return customers. The downsides was the deserts for their size and cost and the french fries. I recommend they do some fresh cut fries."}
{"text":"Simple menu, friendly service and down-right good food!  The chicken fingers are not kid chicken fingers.  They're made with real batter and very tender.  BBQ sauce was good and the serving size of the meals was large.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim a few weeks ago. I got the rib dinner and it smelled so good I ate it in the car and went back in to tell them how good it was. Great staff who were funny and friendly and the food was better than I thought Ribs could be. Amazing."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place... wish I had found it sooner! We've ordered several times in the last couple months- everything I've gotten there has been absolutely delicious! The ribs were HUGE, meaty, tender and soo flavorful. I venture to say they are the best ribs I've had in this area- for sure. The staff is so friendly and kind when you pick up your food. I can't recommend this place more! The sauce is delicious too-so are the homemade chicken tenders... wings... everything!! Try it out! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"After.living in Texas i felt the bbq seen in Cleveland was OK. But i am happy to say I had some of the best ribs ..big and meaty... at Big B  also try the fried wings with sauce."}
{"text":"OMG, the ribs are incredible. Plenty of sauce, so go ahead dump the fries in and enjoy. Your going to need plenty of napkins, paper towels work better. The BBQ sauce is exceptional. Ribs are tender and you can clean the bones with ease."}
{"text":"After a fun filled day with the kids We were starving and in the mood for some BBQ. Luckily our monocle on YELP brought us to Big B's BBQ which was the best decision for that day.  Inside its fun and colorful, red and yellow, two colors that make you hungry. Very clever move. Nice and clean and bright, no clutter on the counter.  The lady who im assuming owns it was there to greet me with some good southern hospitality. \" How are you doing baby\"...that made me want to try the food extra because i felt like i was at home with my grandmother calling me.  We got some ribs, some wings and the pulled pork sandwich. The BBQ sauce drenched everything which was OK by me because it was so good. Sweet and sassy as I call it. The wings were crisped to perfection and the ribs fell right off the bone.  All that for $15 is a bargain to me. Not to mention i was stuffed like a pig afterwards.  WHat really will draw me back is the service. Both the lady at the counter and the gentleman cooking the food made the experience personal and homey. Both started conversations and made it seem like they had known me for years. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bland ribs, chicken tenders good but greasy, sauce is good but I think they put a lot on to cover the blandness of the ribs."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a little late lunch takeout.  Ordered 1/2 slab ribs and chicken strip sampler.  The chicken, like most others reported in their reviews, was great.  Crispy and meaty and great with the bbq sauce.  Ribs were ok, but not great.  I'm a baby back rib fan and the spare ribs were a little fatty.  Also, don't like my ribs that wet.  Lots of sauce on them.  I would come back, though.  Pretty decent food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best barbecue and fried chicken in Cleveland. The meats are moist and juicy, ribs are fall of the bone amazing and the chicken might be even better than the 'cue. Give this place a shot, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First time here.   I brought home the wings and half slab dinner.   The wings were lousy. Some kind of tempura batter on them that was soggy by the time I got it home. I've had better BBQ wings from Chinese delivery.   The ribs weren't \"fall\" of the bone they were \"crumble\" of the bone. Like they'd been boiled. No smoke flavor came through.   They have only one sauce and it's not very good. Just bland no heat no spice.   And only three sides. The beans were tasty. The cole slaw was Costco. I didn't try the fries   And oh yeah!  This might SEEM trivial but .... My bill was $20.25. I gave the woman at the register $21 cash and she kept the 75 cents! She acted like I wouldn't notice!  Like she had it coming!!??!! I was going to put a couple bucks in the tip jar on the counter so I let it ride.   This is NOT good BBQ. If you think it is you haven't had good BBQ.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service!! The place is so clean and smells so good! The food is delicious! True BBQ and saves me the trip of driving to open pit. I'll be a long time customer!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today to grab food for the hungry bunch in the office for lunch. Ordered a full rack meal came with two large and yummy sides, dinner rolls. Also got the loaded fries, wing snack and slider snack so we could sample everything. Ribs were amazing. Sliders were terrific and the wings? Huge. Great service, nice people. Not like the other spot that just closed. Carry out only, three or four napkins. Nothing bad to say. Give them a try."}
{"text":"This is a quality carry out place with no frills.  By keeping the menu short and doing things properly, they got it right.  The shoulder sandwich is something awesome.  They start with a quality bun bottom, cover entirely with perfect pulled pork, sauce and slaw. Then put the top bun on there.  Grab a fork and dig in.  Their chicken strips are real batter fried chicken.  Semi-crispy and delicious.  Order these as a sandwich and choose mustard or sauce with slaw.  No fork required, but it's nice and messy.  The Polish Boy is good, but it's just wrapped in foil and you'll need a plate and a fork to eat it.  The fries are a little on the soft side, not crispy,  making the sandwich a little less than perfect, but still good.   Expect to wait about 10 minutes, since everything is made out order, or just call ahead.  It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Try the ribs chicken wings or chicken strips you will not be disappointed, the food here is hot and fresh if you like good food try Big bs BBQ."}
{"text":"First timer - picked up rib meals for lunch at the office;  the customer ahead of me HIGHLY recommend the chicken strips (at a barbeque place?), telling me that they are \"chicken strips for adults,\" not those finger things you get elsewhere.  OK, threw in a chicken strip snack, and very glad I did - they are juicy, tender, delicious!  The ribs are also really good, and yes, I will return!"}
{"text":"finally got the chance to check this place out and i was definitely not disappointed! since it was my first time here i went for the ribs but couldn't resist getting a few wings to go with them ($1.35 for a large-sized whole wing! crazy cheap!). the ribs were awesome: tender, meaty and flavorful yet with just the perfect amount of consistency. the sweet bbq sauce they were covered in was delicious as well. as for the wings, if you're a fan of breaded and deep fried wings like i am you will not be disappointed. not sure why they're so hard to find like this around here but big b's does them up right! and did i mention how inexpensive this all was? under $20 for an awesome 1/2 slab dinner, 3 whole wings and a can of pop. a bargain!!! not sure if it was big b himself who greeted me and took my order but he was super nice and welcoming! all in all, a fantastic first experience and i'll definitely be back to try the polish boy next chance i get!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today, staff was super friendly and had me smiling/laughing from beginning to end. Very quick, only about 10-15 minute wait for 3 meals. Ribs were super tender and the meat just fell off of the bone, sauces were tasty as well! The chicken you could tell was hand battered and soo juicy, it was delicious! Prices were great for the quantity! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"So far, so good!! This was my 2nd visit and the food is quite good. Only giving 4 Stars because the sauce tasted different this time. Wife says the German Chocolate Cake is amazing!! The peach cobbler is just ok. Can use more sweet.....just my opinion. Prices are decent and the food was served rather quickly.   I will be visiting quite often...."}
{"text":"My boyfriend + I came here super hungry after a 6 hour drive in from Philly. First off, this place smells amazing. In fact, you can smell it down the block. OK. We're hooked. 2. The owners are incredibly sweet. Some good Cleveland folks, for sure. 3. All their food looked incredible but what if we wanna try it all? **boom** 3. They've got different platters feat a variety of their main menu options (fried chicken strips + wings, polish boys, ribs ... hot damn) 4. The bbq sauce is slammin 5. The batter on the chicken is insane. Super light + savory. 6. We're only 1/2 way thru out plates + we're stuffed. Definitely bring a friend Bc you're gonna wanna share. Bottom line: can't wait to be back + support  Good folks like these deserve all the good business. Show up strong + give em some love"}
{"text":"Went to Big B's last night after reading other reviews and it did not disappoint. Ordered the chicken strip dinner and half slab of ribs. Tons of meat on the ribs and the seasoning/sauce was great. The chicken strips were hands down the best I have ever had. The chicken was very juicy and the batter they use is great. The beans and slaw were very good sides. I'll be back...every Friday!"}
