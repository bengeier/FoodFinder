{"text":"This is the best Greek food I've had in a long time. They newly renovated the restaurant so it looks very nice and clean. The service was great! We didn't wait longer than 10 minutes for our food. Plus they gave us free lentil soup which was amaaaaaaaazing.  The prices are really good. Perfect for people looking for a nice night out to eat but without emptying your wallet. Will definitely return 100%."}
{"text":"Parthenon's dining room features an \"indoor terasse\" covered in vines and faux grapes and walls of murals of ancient Greek architecture, deities, and monuments. It's a great place for an intimate table for two or a rowdy table for 10, but please, no breaking plates! This place has been around for a while and the fact that it's family run, makes the food taste extra good. Parthenon is simple and honest, run by great people, the ultimate doctrine of delicious food!"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery from here recently and had a chicken pita and Greek Salad. The pita was really good. Chicken tender, great (but very garlicky) tzatziki sauce. The Greek Salad was ok, the tomatoes were cut very largely, and it did not come with dressing- maybe they forgot it? The delivery was very quick! Would order from here again"}

{"text":"Best lamb brochettes in town.  Exellent price/quality food.  Don't forget to bring your own wine.  The lamb brochette is simply excellent.  It usually comes with rice, salad (you can ask for Greek salad as a replacement) french fries and Tzatziki sauce.  As for the entrees, you must try the Melitzanosalata...just thinking of it is making me hungry.  Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"I'm Greek. And I love Greek food. This one is awesome. I can without a doubt say that it's the best Greek restaurant I've been to.  It's clean. Even the menus are clean. The environment reminds me of Greece. The service is fast and friendly. The dishes are Yummy.  I totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! My two favourites are the salmon fillet and the grilled chicken! Sometimes hard to find parking, but worth it!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on my experience with their delivery. I noticed them on an app but my companion and I had a couple questions so we called to try to place a direct order. The first time I called I was placed on hold and then hung up on after a few minutes. The second time I called I was placed on hold for almost 10 minutes - at which point we gave up and ordered through the app. It took over an hour to arrive, however they did make the necessary change we asked for through the app.   Now on to the food....we ordered the calamari appetizer which we thought was great taste-wise (albeit a bit on the cool side). I had the small pikilia plate so that I could pick at different things. I enjoyed it but it didn't blow my mind - although the garlic in the tzaziki sauce nearly blew my socks off...good thing I wasn't wearing shoes! My guy ordered a souvlaki plate and thought it was cooked well and properly seasoned, stuffing himself to the brim. I'd rate the food alone 4/5 but lack of service made me hangry by the time the food arrived so I have to knock a star off."}
{"text":"We stopped yesterday for lunch and can't wait to go back.  The souvlaki pitas were amazing - perfectly tender and flavored meat, lots of deliciously ripe tomatoes and generous amount of really great tzatziki.  The spanakopita was also yummy! The prices were great and the service was helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"It was o.k., nothing more than that. The lamb in the pita could've been any kind of meat, as far as taste goes. The tzatziki was good, but a lot of garlic...a lot. Tha baklava was above average. Being a BYOB is a plus. If you want a great Greek grillade and it doesn't need to be a BYOB, then try Nostos on L'acadie."}
{"text":"Cute little greek restaurant. Near a bus station. We had the spanakopita as an entree and the one chicken stick plate as the main dish. I enjoyed the food. They gave 2 big cut pieces of spanakopita. One of the best I ate so far. The place is cozy but suprisingly there weren't lots of people this evening ( around 6:30pm)."}
{"text":"I read the other reviews and decided to try this place. It's very good Greek Food but not the best.  If your in the area, it's definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of Greek food, but this place was blew me away. Its a BYOW joint so we hit it off well from the beginning. I  had their calamari meal special, with the chicken rice soup as a starter. Both the food was done really well, with great flavours and rich tastes. I was very happy with my tsaziki sauce on the side with black olives. There was only waitress who was really professional, and service courteous. All in all, I really see myself coming more often here, with a group of friends to just munch on huge portions of food, over some chit chat under a nice groovy planty roof. Cheers!"}
{"text":"One of the best Greek restaurants I've been to in Montreal.  Lentil soup was very flavourful.  The mixed stick dinner was very tasty. Portion was huge -- too large to eat in one sitting.  The stuffed calamari was very good. The three pieces seemed small but they were very filling, with generous portion of rice and Greek salad.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was craving for greek food and found this place near cote des neiges. Service was nice and friendly. They have a great lunch menu at a very reasonable price.  For the food though, i took the doner pita platter, kinda disappointed. You would think that anything would taste good if you are craving for it, unfortunately this was not the case. The pita was cold and hard. The meat was not so hot and tasty. The salad that came with it was was plain lettuce, 2 pieces of tomatoes and 1 piece of feta.   If you are in the area and you are really craving for Greek, then you could go try it out because of the price and service. If not, then i wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"La nourriture est bonne, les prix résonnables, le personnel et le service est professionel et courtois et la livraison est rapide. Bien contente d'avoir ce restaurant Grecque dans le quartier !"}
{"text":"Loved it!!! This place reminds me of my childhood when my parents used to bring me to a now closed restaurant on Côte St Luc called Amazone. This place serves up some really decent Greek food at a very affordable price especially if you go for lunch during the week days. Portions are HUGE!!! Our waiter was soooo nice and sweet! We mentioned how cold it was and he amped up the heating for us. He always made sure we had all we needed. I'm making this my go-to place whenever I go visit my family."}
{"text":"Although their food and is very good. I was very upset after ordering a meal for my spouse and myself that they would charge for a second cup or subsequent refills for coffee. Of course, I would completely understand if you would just go in there and order just a cup of coffee or ordering a desert with a cup of coffee however,  two complete meals to be charged for a second cup of coffee? I spoke with the manager and he did not seem to care about my concerns nor would not even entertain a change in their policy, so I decided no longer will my spouse and I go there. If anyone out there has been there lately and if they changed their policy, I would be more than happy to go back and give them my business."}
