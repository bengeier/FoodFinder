{"text":"Great place for a quick bite.  The mango sticky rice was terrific."}
{"text":"Basil Thai is good for exactly what it is--convenient, cheap, dependable Thai food on campus, served hot and promptly.  I haven't shopped the whole menu, but I like what I regularly get, and that's fine with me."}
{"text":"Ugh... Or should I say: Eww...  I was trying to find a place to have dinner tonight. I didn't want to eat at one of my usual spots and was feeling adventurous, so I just walked down Green St with the hope of finding something interesting. After a few blocks, I ended up passing by Basil Thai House, which I'd never noticed before.  A quick look at the menu: it looks pretty standard. Prices are cheap ($7 entrees), but this isn't too unusual considering this is a college town. I find myself thinking: \"Eh, I like Thai food... how bad could it possibly be?\" and walk in.  What was supposed to be a rhetorical question turned out to be quite appropriate as the food, I found out, was... quite bad. I ordered the fried spring rolls, the basil chicken, and a Thai iced coffee. Pretty safe selection, one would think. The spring rolls were okay, I suppose, though really not that great. The problem was really with the basil chicken: it was honestly quite gross. First, why do they use ground chicken? That's just wrong. Ground chicken is wrong. As are most other types of ground meats, in my humble opinion, but chicken even more so. And the dish was just not good. I ate a little bit of it and was done. For the next half hour I had a gross taste in my mouth. Eww.  Lesson learned: even Thai food isn't always a safe choice."}
{"text":"Very cheap (~$6) dishes, great for when you're feeling too lazy to cook and want to get your vegetable quota for the day in.  Although the food is not as phenomenal as it could be for Thai, the cheapness, speed, and convenience at which it comes gets it 4* from me."}
{"text":"For what it is, affordable thai food, you can't beat Basil Thai.  I grew up in Champaign and now live in LA, and this place is on my list of about 5 places i HAVE to eat at when I come back home to visit.  The Pad Se Ew Beef is amazing & the chicken pad thai is to die for.  I usually order both because I need my fix when I'm home.    I would eat here about 3 times/week when I was in business school.  I miss Basil Thai:("}
{"text":"Ugh. A curry dish with barely any veggies? No, potatoes do not count. They're not green. Even some basil in this so-called  \"basil thai\" restaurant would have been nice. Curry is hard to mess up because it has such strong flavor. However, given a choice, why go and have bad food?"}
{"text":"Seriously bad food. To call this \"Thai\" food is an insult. Food is just tasteless, greasy and unappetizing. I've eaten at a lot of Thai restaurants and this is one of the worst. I used to eat here a lot when I was dieting because the food was so bad I didn't eat much. Also ordered a really watery soup that was low on calories. It's cheap, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"i recently went on thai food kick around town... and to make the comparison fair decided to have basil chicken in several places... Thara Thai, Nitaya Thai and Basil Thai in campustown. the latter (Basil Thai) is by far the worst. as one reviewer already wrote before me, this is made here with ground chicken which is tasteless, too little food, and covered in a litre of sauce/broth. WTF? the tables and chairs in this place also seem sticky... covered in some weird nasty film. in summary, two words: stay away."}
{"text":"Food's mediocre (I usually get Pad Thai or Pad Kee Mao and it's not the best obviously, but it's not bad either), but plus 1 star for being sooo cheap and sooo fast and sooo close to everything on campus!"}
{"text":"This place is very affordable and is a favorite among UIUC students. However, the food is practically tasteless. It seems to me that meat and vegetables are quickly tossed with some spices and they call that a meal.  Simple said, the food lacks the depths of flavors that is present in authentic Thai food. I have lived close enough to Thailand to know what's good and what's not. This, I have to say is a major disappointed. Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"Good, cheap Thai food. I'm a sucker for what is probably inauthentic peanut sauce, and their \"peanut sauce lover\" was a frequent indulgence. The red and green curry is also awesome. Don't miss their red chili sauce to add some real heat to your dishes - it's always very very hot.  If they delivered...I would have lived on this stuff in college."}
{"text":"When I want a quiet lunch after church and I do not have the means to trek elsewhere for thai food, I come here. If you are on the north quad, the journey I don't think is worth it. Their service is quick and relatively inexpensive. However, there are better sit-down thai restaurants in town. They have a \"free meal deal\" if you use cash for 10 meals and the 11th is free."}
{"text":"Great Thai restaurant on campus. They have good portions and a great menu of your basic Thai dishes. I came here often during college, and I've had times where the food is amazing, and other times where it was just ok. They have different chefs so it tastes a little different each time. I love the Pad Se Ewe and Pad Thai. Inexpensive and great place for thai.  Highly Recommended."}
