{"text":"Flaming Stove was handing out free samples of their chicken shawarma a few days ago, at the corner of Yonge and Davisville.  And let me tell you, that was yummy! So yummy in fact that we couldn't shake the thought of having more and returned two days later. 

So first the reason I only gave it four stars: It's actually in the back of the Hasty Market, which made it kind of hard to find since we were actually looking for a restaurant. It's basically a glass counter where they sell ready made foods as well. I would never have tried the shawarma if it wasn't for the free sample a few days before! And there are only a few seats indoors, although they also have a patio for the summer.

And now to what made it awesome:

1. The service was fantastic, they were really helpful and great to chat with while waiting for the food. 

2. It was probably the best shawarma I ever had! Four kinds of different sauces to choose from, and two different breads. The larger sized shawarma was surprisingly big and I had a hard time finishing it all in one go. It was just fresh and delicious and full of flavour, I honestly can't come up with a single bad thing about it!

We will definitely be coming back, although you can only get the souvlaki after 3 o'clock. Even writing about it makes me wanna go back...mmm, and try different combinations of sauce, and maybe the smaller bread this time...I think I know what I'm having for dinner again tonight :)"}
{"text":"This place should be in an episode of DDD. Odd and unsuspecting joint in the back of a convenience store serving up killer shawarma and falafel sandwiches. The staff are very friendly. The Falafel sandwich is probably my favourite in the city, and oh yeah, it's HUGE. It's not often you get quality and quantity like this. You'll pay a few bucks more here than at a Middle Eastern chain but believe me it's well worth it. I usually have half a sandwich and save the other half for later. They use this awesome pita bread for both the Shawarma and Falafel (that they get sent in from Montreal I believe) and when they press your sandwich, it takes on an almost crispy crepe-like texture. Awesome. This place is doing it right. I will say that a few of the sides that they offer are lacking in flavour, and I usually hold the pickles and onions on my sandwiches as they have a tendency to over-power.This is a killer joint!"}
{"text":"Located at the back of a convenient store. Looks a bit dingy but the food is great. I usually get the shawarma salad w extra Amma sauce! Super yummy w a hint of curry. Goes well w the succulent chicken! 
Since I am a bit paranoid about old food, I usually ask for fresh cold salad from the fridge if it's in the middle or end of the day.
Their rice is alright, just plain basmati rice which is microwaved. Wish they had saffron rice or something else. 
Overall reasonably priced. Make sure to ask for fresh ingredients and lots of amma sauce hehe."}
{"text":"Decided to try after so many recommendations.

Chicken shawarma wrap was very fresh and flavourful, and tasted very authentic, as they bake there own saj (wrap) in house and ingredients are fresh and elevated with a variety of spices. A bit pricey (just over $10 after tax), but the portion is quite large (maybe a meal and a half) and nice to try out.

Expect a bit of a line around lunchtime."}
{"text":"Seriously, come for the shawarma but walk here. No parking.

the staff are friendly and the shawarma is among the best I've had. juicy and full of flavour, and not shy of ingredients to fill a pita. Will definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"Had the shawarma wrap.  It's like gourmet shawarma with flavours infused in all the ingredients, unlike many of the other basic shawarma places around the city.  I didn't get to try the hot sauce on this one because I was sharing with my wife, but I'm eager to try it with a bit of hot sauce, especially since there's one called stupid.

My wife wasn't as big a fan as she felt the simple garlic sauce and ingredients were spicy enough as they were.  I still like Dr. Laffa more, especially since they make their own bread and it's available hot on the spot; that's what makes the doctor a 5*.  The price is very nice though."}
{"text":"A place to go if you crave shawarma! I have also tried several different salads all of which were very tasty and fresh. You can also grab a dessert here (try baileys cheesecake, you won't be disappointed), or a freshly made fruit or vegetable smoothie. Nice place for lunch."}
{"text":"One of my favourite lunch spots! Everything made fresh, tastes healthy, nice vegetables and meat, definitely worth a visit. Love their hot sauce."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of healthy and delicious food. All at a very reasonable price. They are great for take-out. But they do have a few tables inside and in their patio for sitting outside in the summer."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Come here regularly. One of the best shawarma places in the city without a doubt. Incredible selection of reheatable entrees as well."}
{"text":"Falafel's were amazing - moist and flavourful!
The garlic sauce was to die for yummy and all made to perfection."}
{"text":"Owner who cares and food carefully prepared for. This is a great place to pick up lunch, they are quick and very friendly. A popular pick from the locals and people who work around the Davisville area. Located inside the convenient store at the back, Flaming Stove has amazing Falafel and Shawarmas. Sauces made there and a nice outside patio clean so you can enjoy it outside."}
{"text":"OK, so they're essentially a counter in a convenience store called Hasty Market. Sounds dubious but some of the best food I have tasted. How would I describe the cuisine? Well there's middle eastern, Indian, Jamaican -- the best I could describe it as is food from around the tropic of cancer if that helps you visualize. They claim they were voted as one of the top chicken shwarmas in Toronto. The kitchen closes early but the convenience store is open all night and carry plenty of prepackaged goodies. But do yourself a favor and get there during the day so you can sample the food fresh."}
{"text":"Best shawarma and falafel hands down in Toronto. Hidden gem in the back of a hasty market. Fresh homemade wraps, toppings and just sooooo delicious. Other food options available, daily specials and good salads. Worth the drive for a chicken shawarma!

You're welcome :)"}
{"text":"With so many glowing reviews, I had high hopes. I was doing errands along Yonge Street so decided to check our Flaming Stove for lunch. As mentioned, it's in the back of a convenience store. I have to give it to the staff; service was excellent. They were very welcoming and quite efficient as well. It was Friday so the line was long with take out orders. I ordered the chicken shawarma with fennel salad along with some tahini and garlic sauces. For a generous portion, it was $8.99 (before tax). The price is right as you can make two meals out of it. I found the meat and vegetables missing something. It could have been more flavourful. Mind you, it was edible. I opted not to get the hot sauce, but if I visit again, I will see if adding hot sauce to the meat will add flavour. There's a seating area/patio in the back so you can eat in.

Good for: lunch, cheap eat, shawarma"}
{"text":"Haven't found a better schwarma I'm the city! Their jerk chicken sandwich, although not really jerk chicken,  is my absolute fave!  You can also get a variety of foods that taste home cooked and are healthy for a great price!"}
{"text":"I have only tried their samosas here. They are really good. The taste is authentic but it's finely ground rather than minced. Their combo items are a bit pricey for prepackaged food though."}
{"text":"Flaming stove is located in the Hasty Market at Yonge/Davisville. Don't be fooled by the odd location, the food here is fresh and made-to-order. 

The standout is their home made laffa wrap. It has to be the largest laffa in the city. 

Unfortunately, the chicken was not spectacular - not fatty, but lacking in flavour. Although it's quite tasty, the laffa wrap actually overpowered the sandwich, as toppings are a bit minimal. Overall, it's very fresh at the Flaming Stove, and a unique food experience due to the odd location. 

If they improve the chicken seasoning and double the amount of toppings, it's an easy 5/5! I'll try the falafel next time. Keep you posted!"}
{"text":"What an amazing find! This small food counter in the back of the Hasty Market serves up amazingly fresh food, including salads, sandwiches, pre-made dinner and lunch combos, snacks, desserts and more. 

The falafel and shawarma wraps/plates are unreal. Packed full of delicious falafel or chicken, shredded lettuce, onions, tomatoes, (roasted zucchini, bell peppers and eggplant on the falafel wrap) pickled veggies and dill pickles topped with three different sauces (garlic, tahini and I forgot the 3rd) plus hot sauce. And they're HUGE! Seriously ah-mazing!! 

So glad this place is in my neighborhood so I don't have to cook when I don't feel like it. I got some amazing food to take home for the next couple of days. :)"}
{"text":"This place almost deserves a one-star but I'm feeling generous.

I've tried to go to this place in the past but because there was no (available) free parking within a 3 block radius I gave up and went elsewhere. 

Today, I tried my luck and parked in the private lot next store. The sandwich board outside displayed tempting options which I was expecting to get fresh inside (as is advertised on the website). Instead I was disappointingly presented with pre-packaged, small, over-priced offerings. I bought two of their offerings because really I wasn't in the mood to go elsewhere. Each entr√©e was $8 and the one I ate tonight left me hungry.

I can't complain about the quality of the food, it appeared to be made from fresh ingredients. However, I'm not going to rave about it either, it really lacked flavor. Perhaps, their best option is the shawarma but I'm not going back a second time to find out.

The hasty market that it's attached to is a fairly good size and offers most food staples. The Hasty market would get a solid 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. Always a great experience when I visit. A dive bar for shawarma. Hidden and rightly so - this place is the bomb. For a very reasonable price, you'll get enough shawarma to feed to. There is usually a small line up of people who know around lunch time. 

So yourself a favour and order the. Hi ken shawarma sandwich. It is ridiculously good, healthy and amazing.  

The shawarma salad bowl is also good - but not the same and $1 more. 

The meat is delicious. Hey on it and discover this place."}
{"text":"Hidden gem of Toronto, they make fantastic shawarma s with home-made pita bread. I go here at least a couple times a week, but my co-workers go at least once a week."}
{"text":"Has to rival for the best shawarmas in the City.  Generous servings, friendly staff, fresh vegetables and chicken.  Sauces are delicious, including their specialty amba spicy sauce.  I made the mistake of asking once for the \"stupid sauce\" and yes, it was stupid.  But seriously, I visit this place twice a month."}
{"text":"EPIC SHAWARMA RECIPE

lettuce, lots of pickles, turnip, lots of coleslaw, double meat, lots of curry sauce.

I've eaten many shawarma in many places and many lands, but damn that was a fine combination! Definite bookmark!!"}
{"text":"I had the shwarma wrap and though it's good enough for 2 meals at $9 I wouldn't go back for it again.

It was almost flavourless, the chicken was a bit dry, and I guess I was expecting a burst of spice, but it just didn't happen. It was fiercely mild even with 3 shots of hot sauce. 

There have a plethora of ready meals to go, I may go back a pick something else."}
{"text":"Have we reached peak shawarma when a convenience store can turn out an an acceptable wrap? That's a huge and I mean huge shawarma for 11 dollars. And it is not awful. Yeah didn't expect to give it this rating."}
{"text":"It's because of places like these that I don't eat at Paramount.  The home-made saj is so flaky that it melts in your mouth. Not to mention all the fresh ingredients they put in the wrap..... you will be full for sure as the shawarma wrap is the size of a submarine!  Easily feeds 2 people. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken shawarma and falafel. The sauces are all made in house and so delicious. Great selection of salads, dips and meals to go. The food is always fresh and they're so generous with their portions. Definitely the best Middle Eastern joint in the city!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, and it was packed! My coworkers recommended this place for lunch. I got the chicken shawarma platter and it was so good. The portions are huge here! My coworker got a shawarma and it was probably the biggest shawarma I've ever seen (no joke). 

The only con about this place would probably be where it's located. In my opinion, the place can be more cleaner/organized. 

I would be back, but only if I'm starving or going to share with someone, because the portions are huge."}
{"text":"I have tried many of the specials, my favorite is the madras curry. I like spicy exotic food and they always have something enticing on the menu. The falafels with salad and yogurt sauce are fantastic!
There are safer options also, grillrd salmon, grilled vegetables, spagetti and meatballs, all exellent. There is free 1 hr parking on Balliol, two parking garages 100 m away (Balliol and Merton), Davisville subway is 50 m away."}
