{"text":"This place may have good food but their employees are rude as hell!!!!  I called for a delivery and my order totaled $13.94 and said my order needed to be $14 in order for delivery and I was like it is only 6 cents!  Well they said let me see what the manager says.  She said add spring rolls cause we can not take order unless over $14.  the spring rolls were 2.00 more... Are you F ing kidding me!!  This place is a joke!  I ordered from Ma Ma Wok instead.  Much more reasonable.  Plus their minimum delivery was much lower."}
{"text":"Oh man.. If I could give 0 stars I would. I'm new to the area so just tried this place on a whim for some lunch specials. I got the sweet and sour chicken and house lo mein. The flavor of both was really good and I would be a repeat customer until... I found a baby cockroach dead in with the last bites of my rice. BARF!! It looked like an over cooked piece of rice and I almost didn't notice. Now I'm wondering how many more were in the food. Health board should be called to inspect!!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from Lotus Cafe at least 10 times in the past year. The food has never been as good as Lotus 2 or Great Wall on Carmel Rd but convenient. Last nights take out made me decided to NEVER go back. The food was super greasy, bland to the point my family hesitated to eat it.  When I called the store, the manager told me \"her cooks have been cooking for over 15 years and could not have done anything wrong.\"  Sorry Lotus Cafe, but what you did do wrong was lose me as a good customer."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from Lotus Cafe for a long time but I'm not quite sure why. I usually order General Tso's chicken and half of the time it's good but the other half it's undercooked( not crispy) and the chicken is , well, in little bitty pieces parts. I know that is not the best description but that is what it is. It's like they fry up scraps of chicken. Tonight I placed an order online and decided to change to the pepper chicken but what I got was lot's of onions( I mean a lot of onions) and chicken, but no pepper. Humm. It should have been called onion chicken.  It wasn't terrible, just not what I was expecting. I keep giving this place a chance because because they are very nice, I just wish they were more consistent."}
{"text":"Second time.   Soooo much better.  I'd definitely recommend the broccoli with garlic sauce and veggie fried rice. Soooo freaking good.   A little less attentive as I told them we were vegan and they gave us a pork egg roll with our meals. However the food is tasty. We're happy.   General Tso tofu is sweet as hell, lol still. But uh. My son is loving it, of course. I'd say stick with the veggie dishes (if you're vegetarian) - as the tofu is soft even when asking for it extra crispy. Overall nice spot when I don't feel like cooking. Broccoli and other veggies are crisp and fresh. Sauce is piping hot and savory. All is good. Hopefully everything is vegan, as she stated lol   Peace"}
{"text":"Have had takeout two times from here and both times were good experiences. About 15 minutes for pick up which is perfect. Decent prices. Pretty good food! Crab rangoons are great. Also like their beef lo mein and general tsos chicken. Everyone who I have spoke with on the phone or encountered has been very friendly. Will return."}
{"text":"This place sucks the lady is very rude to me I order a chicken and broccoli dinner and a garlic chicken got home and my garlic chicken order was messed up so I called back to get a correct order and she would argue with me that at all things the lady is racist Asian lady never would eat there ever again and the food was so nasty I would not recommend any body to eat here of I would eat a TV dinner before I eat there again besides the facts this lady and her husband are filthy people they touch money and then touch your food they don't even wash there hands I hope any body who eats here don't get sick"}
{"text":"Probably the worst chinese food I've ever had....and I've been eating it since I was a wee tot.  My parents were in town and needed a chinese fix (they live in the mountains in Idaho and good Chinese is few and far between!)  The Almond Chicken was inedible...actually the only edible item we ordered was the fried chicken, which was an impulse buy my dad had while on the phone ordering.  So we had fried chicken for dinner...and the rest we had a good laugh about.  It was so bad we couldn't even get mad.   1 point for delivery!   I need to find some good chinese food in South Charlotte!  All suggestions welcome!"}
{"text":"I've ate here 2 times in the past two weeks. I wasn't expecting much besides a standard whole in the wall Chinese takeout place. Didn't want anything spectacular. Just something yuck and easy. Both times I have tried here, I have ended up sick from eating some standard things."}
{"text":"enjoy their egg fu young with some fried dumplings. Good quality and flavor at fair prices!"}
{"text":"I normally am very picky about Chinese restaurants and this is not one I would have tried on my own volition.  However, my neighbors love it and suggested we get take-out from here one night.   I  personally found the quality of the food to be lacking...my cashew chicken was sort of greasy and the chicken had a chewy-icky consistency..... but what can you expect when you are paying $7.95 for a dinner entree?   Also, they serve their entrees with fried rice and an egg roll but  I really prefer brown rice and a spring roll.  Next time I am in the mood for Chinese food,  I'll stick to Wan Fu or Jo-Jo China Bistro."}
{"text":"Picked up take out from Lotus the other day. Everything we tried was tasty, fresh and didn't leave a weird greasy aftertaste in your mouth like most Chinese take out places.   They also deliver and you can order online. This is a plus for us. We've ordered in when we had a pajama day and didn't feel like leaving the house. Everything was delivered hot and quickly!   Great little place!"}
{"text":"Well we order from this Chinese restaurant whenever I''m at my brothers place in Ballantyne.  I must say the Scallion Chicken is my go to dish here.. tonight I am going out of my comfort zone ordering the Pineapple Chicken. The place is priced just right, it is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Ballantyne next to Pei Wei just this place gives you more food than Pei Wei.  The Pinapple Chicken was very good.. but not better than the scallion chicken."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. We ordered take out and it is insanely close to where we live.  We tried three soups; Egg Drop, Wonton? and Hot and Sour.  Mel ate the first two as I am the H&S soup lover in this house.  He said Egg Drop was very good but the Wonton soup was a bit salty which after sampling, had to agree. Maybe the broth had cooked down too long and needed diluting?. My H&S soup was very good.  It was a bit more on the sour side but I surprisingly enjoyed it for that.  All soups were piping hot.  We split a General Tso's Chicken combination.  It comes with the aforementioned?, pork fried rice and an egg roll.  The egg roll was the type? found at most Chinese? take-outs.  The pork fried rice was very good. Very hot and flavored nicely.  The chicken was good as well.  Light on the sauce but what I enjoyed the most about this dish was it wasn't overly sweet.  Sometimes when you order GTC from take-outs it is sooooo sweet.  This wasn't.  Will definitely go back.  Oh, and they deliver too which is nice, but it is so close!"}
{"text":"Chinese food with great price.  I would say it is average and nothing extraordinary. The crab Rangoon was my favorite, one of the bests I ever had. I had beef and broccoli and my husband had steak pepper. His dish was more onions and peppers than steak and mine the steak had a weird consistency. There aren't many sits to dine in, I feel it is more like a take out place. Service is fine and food gets ready fast. They have a lot of options and very interesting lunch specials.  I had a coworker that always talked about this place like it was the best Chinese in the area, which in my opinion is not. However if you are in the area and want to grab a quick bite this is the spot for you.  The place is not close to my house so honestly I don't believe I will be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've ate here several times for lunch and haven't been disappointed yet. Their portions are generous, the fried rice isn't stale, and it's always consistent. My favorites are the broccoli & chicken and crispy scallion chicken lunch combos. Most American Chinese restaurants serve the same dishes, but everyone knows the quality varies. Lotus cafe is one of the better ones."}
{"text":"I've been ordering here for years. It's decent for Chinese food. Last night was an exception. I ordered mine and my bfs dinner online. Normally dinner specials come with fried rice, online it was an upcharge for that. I ordered my boyfriend Pepper steak with no peppers and onions  ( he likes the sauce ) not the veggies. Well they called and said it would be extra for no veggies...so more money for less food. I was like hmm ok. Well when the food arrived my bf went to sign for it and there was not a tip option and the delivery man told my boyfriend no tip, no food... WTF?! So my bf came inside and asked if we had cash for a tip...we did not. So the man said leave tip on paper and basically until my bf wrote him a tip he never took the food out of the bag. We live right beside of this place. I can be there on foot in 2 mins and this man was That insistent on being tipped. And the food was pretty blah. Super dry rice. Won't be ordering from here anymore. Left a bad taste literally and figuratively."}
{"text":"Eh. This was the driest Pad Thai I have ever had. I literally stuck my fork in the noodles and a huge chunk came up with it. Shouldn't you be able to \"stir\" your noodles? Also, the chicken was cold and very stringy/chewy. Egg drop soup was okay, though. It's pretty decently-priced."}
{"text":"this place is fantastic!  great portions - great food - great prices!  my husband and I are very picky when it comes to chinese food - and this place nailed it. well done!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Chinese food here.  I've had a couple of dishes both being excellent.  I've had their Kung-Pao Chicken and Hunan Beef.  They tend to prepare their dishes in a very thick sauce which makes the dish very flavorful.  This is one of those Chinese place I stop at on the way home from work if I want something quick.  They take about 5 minutes to prepare the food and it costs about $5.50.  That price includes the dish, rice, and a spring roll.  The shop itself doesn't look that great in appearance but I wouldn't let that put you off trying it."}
{"text":"We get takeout from Lotus II every week. Their food is consistently great and reasonably priced.  Our favorites include Scallion Chicken and Singapore Noodles.  If you're looking for solidly good Chinese takeout in the Ballantyne area, give them a try..."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and decided to try this place out. I was not impressed what so ever. I ordered beef and broccoli and the texture of the meat was almost gummy like. My boyfriend ordered as well and didn't have anything negative to say about his meal but nothing positive. I gave this place three stars because simply put, the food is average"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today and I was extremely pleased. The General Tso chicken was cooked perfectly, not over breaded or over fried. The sauce had a lot of flavor but not overpowering. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Thumbs up...so far.  We've been looking for a new place to get good/decent \"New York\" style Chinese takeout since Jo Jo's China Bistro (in Stonecrest) closed.  We've tried several places in the area and have been very disappointed.  This is our 1st go-around with Lotus Cafe and we're very pleased.  As a test, I made a couple of specific requests on the how they prepare the food.  They did what we asked and we got what we wanted.  That's a huge plus.  Being this was our 1st time with Lotus Cafe, we only ordered 3 basic dishes but now we're looking forward to giving this place another try with other dishes and hoping for another positive outcome and a \"go to\" place for Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"Quick friendly service and large portions. Has been a standard for me for the past eight years. Awesome General Tso chicken!"}
{"text":"Did a to go order the other night. Took about 15 minutes....seems about the standard wait time for Chinese take out. We got an order of orange chicken,  vegetables fried rice, a couple egg rolls and my favorite,  hot and sour soup. Love the soup! Good flavor and nice spice! Enjoyed the orange chicken as well. Wish it was a little crispier. The fried rice was ok, not bad but it wasn't blowing me away. Now, the egg rolls were kinda cold and didn't have the best flavor. All around it was a good experience and I'll go back to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Great local place with take out service. The cashew chicken is very good and the egg rolls delicious."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this restaurant.  We had carry out for four.  My wife picked up the food and she commented on how nice the staff was to her.   We ordered 2 egg rolls, egg drop soup, General Tso's chicken, beef with snow peas, sesame chicken and chicken with cashews.    The food was great.  Everyone was very happy with the portion sizes, quality and the nice food containers, which were very nice for left over storage.    When we eat Chinese it will definitely be at Lotus Cafe.  We highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Have eaten delivered food from here maybe 2 or 3 times, my experiences in the past were less than desirable. However, on Monday they won me back over. My co-workers and I ordered out and I got the bean curd family style ($7.95 during dinner time), which is a generous portion size of mixed vegetables (broccoli, green and red peppers, onions, bok choy, baby corn, etc.) with tofu and a pint of rice! I filled up at lunch Monday and today, Tuesday and am still snacking on it this evening! I am extremely impressed. Great quality, price and size! Next time my co-workers order from here when I forget to bring my lunch, I will definitely splurge for Lotus!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over 10 years now and it is still my all time favorite Chinese takeout. I've lived in 3 different states and ha e yet to find Chinese takeout I enjoy as much as Lotus.  My go to is Seseme chicken and fried rice. Hopefully I'm still going here in another 10 years."}
{"text":"I and my family have chosen LOTUS for 3 years or more and their food is EXCELLENT every time. Slightly crispy Very Fresh veggies, large servings (dinners can cover 2-3 moderate hungers). My faves are Beef & Broccoli, Chicken Garlic, Moo Shu Pork, Pork fried rice and pork Egg Foo Yung. IMHO, LOTUS FAR surpasses 'other' Chinese Rest a few doors down and recently they refurbished the eat in area to much improvement. Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"It's slightly above average, however I have had a couple bad meals mostly when I order later and for delivery.   Other than that, the fact the deliver is a huge plus and like I said- it is above average Chinese food."}
