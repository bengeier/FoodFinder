{"text":"I am what I like to think a sushi expert. This restaurant is very dirty. The waitress' are very rude and they bring you wrong dishes. I once had to wait 15min for wasabi major disappointment !!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch right when they open after looking up this place online and hearing about it from my friend. Service was quick and attentive. The price here for the AYCE is PHENOMENAL: $12 for lunch, $20 for dinner. Their AYCE menu's have a pretty good selection: soup, salad, kitchen items such as fried things and noodles/rice, regular rolls, nigiri sushi, and special rolls. There are also a few options for dessert.  I tried a variety of things like the shrimp tempura, fried scallops, multiple regular and special rolls, and nigiri. All were pretty decent with the Manhattan Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, and Shrimp Tempura being the stars. The fried scallops were disappointing as they were just pollock in the shape of scallops that were fried. The Nigiri were on the iffy side to me as the fish was VERY room temperature, to an almost uncomfortable point. They were also quite heavy on the rice. I would also avoid the deep fried rolls as they were low on feeling and on the heavy side in terms of rice as well. They offer Ice Cream in a few flavors as well as Deep Fried Bananas for dessert. I had the Ice Cream and it was pretty standard.  All in all, this place is absolutely great for the price. The selection and service are also great but one should beware of certain items on the menu."}
{"text":"This was our favourite sushi place until our last visit when the shrimp weren't cleaned properly, the sushi was soaking wet (with what I have no idea), and there was hair in our tempura. When we complained, they acted like they did nothing wrong and kept talking in their own language in front of us. Then they expected us to pay for our meal, giving us $5 off. There are much better sushi places!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! The all you can eat lunch is very affordable and the food came out quickly."}
{"text":"This place seems to have decent reviews, but I can't figure out how.  So it's about 6 PM on July 4 and I'm looking for a sushi place. I'm new to the area and have been trying out many different sushi restaurants. I'm a connoisseur. I know my sushi.  I roll up to Akita and notice that it's pretty dead. I figured that this was due to the holiday, but I soon realized that this may not be the reason at all.  I went inside and ordered two rolls. I noticed that they were extremely small, 6 piece rolls. They were average tasting. Nothing special.   At this point, I thought \"Ehh, average. Probably won't come back here, but not terrible.\"  Then, I got the bill. I assumed that for 2 small six piece rolls, it would be maybe $10-15 tops (before the tip).   NOPE! $25. This is the biggest bill I've ever gotten at a sushi restaurant for friggin California and Philadelphia rolls. This was also the first time that I didn't leave any tip at all (I always leave 20% unless the service is bad, in which case I leave 10%). But I've never left 0% in my life.  I don't regret it though."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review and after eating at Akita tonight, I just had to rave about how amazing the experience was. I have no idea how they can charge $20 for unlimited all-you-can-eat sushi, including sashimi!!   I had a variety of sashimi (tuna, yelllowtail and salmon), rolls (Philly roll, spicy salmon hand roll, spicy tuna hand roll) and nigiri (white tuna). It was all really really good and some of it (the salmon and spicy tuna/salmon) was exceptional. The sashimi cuts are great and the nigiri is wonderful (no skimpy fish on top of huge rice balls here).  The service was awesome, too, with friendly staff coming in to check on us and make sure we had everything we needed.  Seriously, go check this place out...I REALLY hope they are around for a long time. It's fabulous!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi place. Been several times, mostly cause my girlfriend loves it, but she's too picky to have a decent opinion on food. I think they were better before they expanded their menu to add common things like chicken wings and other western fast food dishes. Great place when they have their end of summer/winter sale which brings the AYCE price down by 4$. But I've definitely had better, I've definity had worse."}
{"text":"Bad service Waiter disappeared and didn't come back Had to find the manager to order more food Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Sorry but this place use to be so good when it first opened. The service is not good, and when you order you feel like your bothering them lol. I don't think I'll be back here, it's to bad because I did like it at first."}
{"text":"They advertise \"All you can eat\", but this isn't really the issue.  Its really \"As much time as you can commit to sitting down in the restaurant\".  It should also state \"As much patience as you have for the process\".  That would be more appropriate since I know that I could have surely eaten more, but was ready to get going long before my appetite was satisfied.  The place feels a little cold when you enter.  Not terrible but certainly not a cozy inviting atmosphere.  They still have the steel things in place from when they must have tried to make it revolving sushi and the waitresses are nice but speak little english it seems.  The busboy must've gone past us 4-5 times with an empty cart that he kept pushing and had a shirt on from a local auto mechanics shop.  We ordered gyoza, fried rice, teriyaki beef and a seaweed salad for apps.  The seaweed salad arrived right away, the fried rice and beef 7 minutes later (more than 5 less than 10 at least) and the gyoza didn't make it for over 20 minutes.  We presumed they forgot but they didn't.  Still, it came well past our sushi that we then ordered.    They were super disorganized.  I didn't know if people were waitresses/waiters or cooks or busboys.  I kept trying to make eye contact because I didn't know who was supposed to wait on us and who wasn't and eye contact was difficult.  And there was no rhyme or reason to when or how the orders placed would arrive.    We finally felt pressured to order desert and so we did.  Fried bananas and green tea ice cream.  They came out in this order:  1.  Fried bananas 2.  Beef fried rice that had been ordered 15 minutes earlier 3   5 minutes after the green tea ice cream.  Thats banana's B A N A N A S!  I can hear Gwen Stefani singing it now!  Just an arduous process.  The sushi was fresh but nobody points out the specials on a blackboard in another area of the restaurant.  Pieces not large, but for $20 if you've got the patience you could surely clean up.  But you've gotta be OK committing a lot of time because orders don't come quickly (well some do some don't...you have no idea which is which).  I think I've gotta get drunk first next time.  Then I'd probably love it.  But for a structured night this was not the call."}
{"text":"First let me say the customer service is unique and tailored to your visit. Definitely returning with friends and family. Also $21 all you can eat sushi deliciousness menu to choose from. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great sushi, it was fresh, vibrant in colors and nicely made. The service was also great, they made sure our drinks were full and satisfied. The place looks very nicely decorated as well! I just wish the rotating bar when a tad faster so I can look at all the sushi before I stuff my belly!   Deff coming back! Great lunch time spot!!!"}
{"text":"Great price on all you can eat ($12 for lunch; $20 for dinner). The deal includes sashmi. The quality of the fish is quite high, esp. considering the price. I have been to several places that use 'all you can eat' as an excuse for dolling out cheap or thin fish. This is not one of those places. The service is solid as well. Kids eat free, 4 and under. This means my wife, son, and I got out of there with everything we wanted at the dinner price, including three beers total for $60. Not bad at all for all you can eat sushi for 3 and a few beers."}
{"text":"When I spotted \"all you can eat\" and \"sushi\" glaring at me from the same sign on the exterior of the building, the stage was set.   As a preface, I should note that I have been an avid sushi hound for nearly thirty years. I know good sushi, sashimi and seafood from meh and there's no fooling me.  First Impressions What I liked - We were immediately greeted upon entering and offered seating. I always prefer to sit at the sushi bar where I can see all the action as well as the food preparation. This was no issue as the sushi bar was deserted. We were promptly handed menus and offered drinks. Very good. What I didn't like - There was no clearly defined reception area. It was somewhat uncomfortable entering, as if we had walked in on someone's private dinner party. A woman walked in right behind us who had arrived ahead of the rest of her party. There really wasn't any place for her to comfortably sit and wait for them. In addition, there was evidence of a defunct conveyor carousel. A neat idea that obviously didn't fly. Cutting boards had been scotch-taped over portions of the carousel as make-shift service areas. It had a very 'not ready for prime time' feel to it. I'm certain it would raise a health inspector's eyebrow as well.  Offerings What I liked - Where AYCE is concerned, one expects a stripped down, naked menu. Such is not the case at Akita Sushi. They present an extensive selection broken out into appetizers, wok dishes, teriyaki and tempura, udon/ramen faire, nigiri sushi and sashimi, rolls, house specialties and desserts. If you are looking for more exotic items like uni (sea urchin) or freshwater scallops, you aren't going to find them at an AYCE establishment. So, be reasonable. What I didn't like - There were no descriptions for many of the dishes. Even simple faire like an udon noodle dish warrants a brief accounting for those who have dietary restrictions or are unfamiliar with Japanese cuisine. For those with severe food allergies, proceed with caution as native English speakers are in short supply and concerns about ingredients may not be fully understood.  Service What I liked - Service was prompt and very courteous. As soon as one of us lifted a menu, someone popped right over ready to take our order. Soft drinks and water were never empty. Very good. Food never sat in the service area for long before being delivered. Empty dishes were quickly removed as well. The check was presented along with desserts and was taken care of in short order thereafter. Again, very good. What I didn't like - I asked a server whether the eel was anago or unagi (sea eel or freshwater eel). He didn't know and didn't offer to find out for me despite standing only a few feet from the sushi chefs who most certainly would have known. Not exactly a deal killer, but servers should be able to answer basic questions about the menu and a shoulder shrug is never the right answer. I ordered it anyway and for the record, it was anago and the only dish I had that wasn't particularly fresh. I told you there's no fooling me. The food delivery was, at times, poorly expedited as some dishes we ordered appeared directly while others seemed to catch up to us twenty minutes or so later. This is more a dysfunction of the kitchen than the service staff but reflects poorly of the service in general. Despite there being only two of us, servers didn't know to whom the dishes belonged when they were delivered. This was an annoyance as we had to stop and identify the dish to try to figure out who ordered it. It would be a nightmare for a large party. Lastly, the check had a full accounting of every last thing we ordered reminding me of my penchant for sushi gluttony. A simple 'AYCE sushi $19.99' would have been in better taste.  Food Quality What I liked - Save for the anago, everything was reasonably fresh, tasted good and was well presented. I had some miso soup and a sampling of a gyoza, then got right down to business with the sashimi and sushi. The trio of sushi chefs seemed a bit overworked but turned out consistent good quality all the same and didn't seem to balk at special requests from other diners. Portions were reasonable and not overly spiced or awash in sauces. Most dishes came out quickly with a few exceptions. Nothing really went over what was reasonable timewise. All very good. What I didn't like - Sushi rice should be sticky. The rice was a bit flaky and didn't hold together. Nigiri pieces not wrapped in seaweed disintegrated on the plate. Once again, not a deal killer for $20 AYCE, but you wanted a review and I'm giving you one.  Ambience The dining room was comfortable if arranged a bit cafeteria-like. The sushi bar was more brightly lit than necessary but ok. The interior was decked out in nice upscale finishes belying the $20 AYCE modus operandi.  With the caveat that service is a bit quirky and Akita has the feel of a first-time restaurateur, I would recommend it for good food and value."}
{"text":"Don't waist your time or your money the owner is extremely rude and don't give a crap whether you eat there or not.  I have never been treated this badly by any establishment hope they go out of business"}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, fresh food, attentive owner/manager/chef/and staff. Huge all-you-can eat menu as well as ability to order off specialty menu. Great meal overall! I would recommend it."}
{"text":"All you can eat menu, for a huge variety of Asian dishes along with a great variety of fish ! Great kind staff and ownership. Dinner and lunch is great here ! We come here every week to get our sushi fix  !"}
{"text":"This place is all about price!!! All you can eat lunch is exactly what it entails for a mere $12 per person prior to 4:30pm. All you can eat includes all sorts of rolls and sushi, appetizers, noodles etc. If you're a big fan of average quality sushi at nearly zero cost to you this is the place to go. I'm leaving today with two orders of noodles two orders of miso, 6 full rolls of sushi and dessert between the girlfriend and I for a total of $24! What a steal."}
{"text":"I can't praise Akita Sushi enough. The location is convenient near the 101 and Pima Hwy. The building is in a small strip mall and unassuming. Once you walk in, you are received in a friendly manner and seated according to preference. I always enjoy sitting at the sushi bar. The waiters are prompt and courteous. The best part is the quality and presentation of the food. The sushi chefs are amazing. Presentations are appealing. The food itself, fresh and expertly prepared. I ordered 10 small plates (1 pc each, except for a special roll). From the appetizers to the nigiri, sashimi, hand rolls, and house special rolls, they were all excellent. Everything was so delectable, I had to resist ordering more. It is an all-you-can-eat menu, but they ask -and courtesy requires - that you only order what you can consume. I've been there a few times already and the service and food quality have been consistently great. I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Waited over an hour to get our food and was yelled at by the manager for complaining. Was told it was because they were busy and we should just wait."}
{"text":"Extremely generous cuts for the sashimi, along with great tasting rolls. Service was a little slow, with the servers not really taking much time or making too much effort to check in with us about the food.   I really enjoyed the salmon sashimi, it was very fresh and almost creamy in texture. All our sashimi was served very cold, which was great! Cooked foods were served either warm or hot as well, which made us feel assured that the food had not been left standing outside till the food runners got round to running our food. All in all, the AYCE buffet is amazing value if you have the stomach for it."}
{"text":"everything smells like fish. ..soup, drinks, table and so on. quality of food was worse than regular buffet. i could have better quality sushi for less money. Paid $60 for 2people, we were afraid to try food... what a waste.."}
{"text":"if i could give -5 stars i would. these people must really fucking hate doing business as they are consistently closed during their own business hours. this has happened many many many times. either update your hours or stay open as advertised."}
{"text":"Was about to dine here before I read this article for having 8 health code violations,    http://raycomnbc.worldnow.com/story/25531763/dirty-dining-may-15-worst-offenders-had-7-health-code-violations?config=H264  Perhaps I'll try some other time.  Most likely not."}
{"text":"Neither my son nor I could eat the sushi here. It was terrible. Flavors were off, gyoza was deep fried and over cooked with an unrecognizable filling. No authentic gyoza sauce, but a syrupy pink sauce that was worse than the packaged stuff.  The salad was drowning in a sweet vinegary concoction that didn't resemble anything Asian. We couldn't eat any of it, yet they insisted we pay anyway. It was a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Great addition to the new restaurants in the area. Consistently  good quality  food and friendly staff.   The lunch all you can eat rate is well worth it.   Many platter options for take out."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. The teriyaki, udon, and tempura are good, but there's WAY TOO MUCH RICE with the nigiri. The fish are super thin and there's a truckload of rice. Go for the rolls and the other menu items, not the nigiri. Also, the green tea ice cream had this artificial scent to it. We ended up only ordering once. PS - the lunch AYCE price is now 12.99."}
{"text":"I went here earlier with a couple of my friends. It was my second time going, and I was extremely hungry after the exams. Since this was the only sushi restaurant in town, we went to Akita's. Honestly, I would have to rate Akita's sushi a three.  The sushi was OK, it was not the best nor was it the worst. The appetizers tasted better, in my opinion. My friends and I, ordered the cheese dumplings which were very delicious. We also ordered salmon, tuna, California roll, spicy tuna etc... It was not the best. As for the ice cream, I would say it is the best. There are many flavors that  you can choose from and they all tasted really good.  The service was terrible. It took us a while to get a waiter, and they got our orders mixed up many times.   In the end, for an AYCE it's OK. The price at lunch of $12.99 is average, considering that it is the only sushi restaurant in town, and the quality of the food. The automatic $4 tip was very dissatisfying due to the fact that I did not enjoy their service at all. The quality of the food was OK but the service was terrible."}
{"text":"Been going here consistently for over a year now, the value is insane for the amount of sushi you can order. The quality of the sushi is good and the service is great. I recommend this place to all my friends and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"First time at Akita sushi (or any revolving sushi bar). Food was excellent: extremely fresh, with sushi varieties I hadn't seen before. The revolving part is great fun, although a few of the signs could have used more detailed descriptions. You can also order off the menu & there are lots of traditional cooked items as well as sushi & sashimi. Plates are color-coded for price so it's easy to keep track of spending. The chef is right there to create specialty rolls at your request. He is extremely friendly & more than willing to answer questions (the revolving thing cost $100,000 & this is his third restaurant).  The entire staff was friendly & helpful without being intrusive. When we sat down & were handed the traditional split bowls with wasabi & pickled ginger, I laughingly told the waiter we would be needing LOTS more ginger, expecting refills later when we ran out. He immediately brought a huge bowl & yes, my sister & I ate it all.  Don't know what to say about the food violations concerns that 2 people mentioned. One at least was written when they'd just opened; perhaps the problems have been resolved. The place looked immaculate & the food was extremely fresh. We both loved it. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. Love the location, service and decor too. I am amazed they can pull it all off at such a low price! I'm thinking it can't last long before the price will go up, but for now it's the best deal going!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant twice. First visit was great, we received plenty of attention and the owner was very on top of things, getting our food and taking our orders promptly. Second visit was far, far worse. It seemed they only had 2 waiters for a packed lunch service, we arrived and were seated promptly. Our waiter brought us ice water and took our order.  Then the wait began, we sat for approximately 40 minutes with zero attention or food. We watched 3 tables that had come in AFTER we had been seated receive their food and begin eating, waiters were walking table to table with plates of food asking if they had ordered it before finally realizing that (some of it) was ours. We waited 45 minutes for 4 pieces of gyoza and 2 pieces of nigiri hamachi sushi. The sushi we received had dry rice and the fish felt like it had been sitting under a heat lamp.  15 minutes later we received two more of the rolls we ordered (we ordered it all at once) after seeing it sit in the food-pass for the duration. 10 minutes after we received our 2 rolls, we received the rest of our order, which was admittedly better than the food we had received so far, likely due to it not sitting for long periods of time before reaching our table.  Overall, our first visit had us very excited to go there again and again but it seems like amateur hour without the owner around. We'll probably give it one more shot but the second visit left a very sour taste in our mouth,"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place. LOVE IT. all you can eat sushi - but its actually fresh, and delicious, and quality, and authentic, and delicious. This place started out as a revolving sushi style restaurant but i believe new owners took over and the guy believes fish should be made to order and served fresh and at the proper temperature plus he likes the idea of people being able to try new things without hesitation. I absolutely love this concept and try to go at least once a week to support them and get my sushi fill (literally). this place is brilliant and I would give more stars if i could. :D"}
{"text":"Re-opened after many months of being closed due to a fire. Great atmosphere and the AYCE was amazing too!! So happy they are back."}
{"text":"I'm hesitantly giving Akita sushi only three stars because I really desire to award them four.  However based on our total dining experience (food quality, selection, cleanliness, service and wait times) I must in all honesty deliver only three stars, primarily based on the extremely long wait and inaccuracy of our order.  When it did finally arrive to our table the food itself was pretty good, considering this is an AYCE sushi restaurant and comparing it against other identical establishments.  A 20 to 30 minutes delay from the time we placed our order to the time it physically arrived on our table seems a tad too long compared to other similar dining venues we've had.  Additionally, a few items we ordered did not show up at all.  We spoke to our server about this and he apologized for the mix up, finally bringing our ika nigiri and Las Vegas rolls towards the end of our meal.  The slow arrival of our dinner items could be attributed to a very busy and totally unexpected Sunday evening the day before July 4th.  I was told normally Sunday evenings are fairly quiet according to the staff however it appears the volume of customers this evening caught them off guard.  It was so busy the owner \"Sam\" who was off that day had come in to help the other sushi chiefs meet the demand.  But this speaks a great deal of Sam's dedication to his customers.  They have a pretty good selection of items from the sushi variety to the appetizers and hot foods.  Our server \"Brian\" was awesome.  He was very attentive, always mindful and filling our water, iced and/or hot green tea glasses without having to be asked even though he was busier than a one legged man in a butt kicking contest.  His temperament was exactly what you'd want and expect in a server, a friendly demeanor with a nice smile every time he interacted with us.  Brain apologized often for the long wait and provided an acceptable reason for the delay.    We used the long delay productively catching up with one another in good conversations and showing one another photos and videos from our phones.  Thank God for technology effectively filling in the gap.  Overall we were quite satisfied and happy with our dining experience and will be going back in the future at which time I'm hoping to be able to increase their rating to four or possibly five stars.  And at $21 per person its a great deal.  Here's a few tips for future diners to be mindful of:  1.  The nigiri style sushi is only one piece per order (traditionally served in two pieces) however you can order as many as you want.  2.  The sashimi is also limited to one piece per order but once again you can order as many as you desire.  3.  There is no tako (octopus) on the menu.  4.  The makizushi (rolled) sushi are smaller than normal which is cut into six small pieces.  5.  They do and will charge you for any wasted food. This is a very good practice as it keeps the cost down for the restaurant which in turn is passed on to you, the customer."}
{"text":"I had the All-You-Can-Eat Lunch on a Sunday around 2pm. Lunch AYCE menu does not come with the two items I really wanted: sashimi and Beef Short Ribs.  I can deal with good food and poorer service (as a lot of Asian restaurants don't have great service) but when both food and service is mediocre at best... I think I would have given 2.5 stars if they had half star options.  This is what I ordered:  Item 1) one Spicy Salmon Sushi.  This came as 3 pieces, raw salmon mixed with spicy mayo wrapped in seaweed (like the way they do the fish egg sushi) with some tempura bits sprinkled on top.  Item 2) Kimchi salad. This didn't come, then I reminded the server when she came by so that she ended up grabbing this for me.  Item 3) Salmon & Avocado roll. This came as expected, no surprises, which was good.  Item 4) Snow Mountain Temike (handroll), has crab meat, mayo, shrimp tempura. Decent.  Item 5) one order of Shrimp Tempura. This never came.  Item 6) Spicy Salmon roll. I would never order this again from here. It's mostly tempura bits and the little bit of raw salmon that is lost in the roll it seems! I specifically asked the server what was in this roll and she said in her broken English that it had salmon and cucumber. Inaccurate description! I ate one piece and left the remaining 5 there.  Item 7) Deep Fried Tofu. Nothing great. I guess I was hoping for Agedashi tofu like I've had at sushi restaurants in Vancouver.  Item 8) one order of Sweet Potato Tempura. This came with 2 pieces.  Their take-out menu that I had at home said AYCE Lunch was $13.99 but apparently that's not updated, it's actually $14.50. My bill came to $16.55 and I didn't order anything not included in the AYCE. AND that was with a $1.50 off coupon. I should have asked for a copy of my actual bill, as they didn't give me that when I walked up to the cash register to pay.  I'm wondering if they charged me for the spicy salmon roll that I sent back -- again, I had told the girl that I didn't want this and that the other server told me there was salmon, cucumber, and spicy mayo in it but it turned out there was no cucumber and it was full of the crispy tempura bits with some salmon. Barely any salmon in my opinion.   Lunch all-you-can-eat is supposed to be $14.50. So minus my $1.50 coupon makes it $13.00. Add 13% HST and it should have been $14.69. They charged me $16.55.  I do recall another reviewer saying she wasn't pleased with the automatic $4 tip that Akita added to her bill for AYCE. Maybe they added an automatic tip to my bill that I didn't know about. I only tipped 9% for my bad experience but it looks like they still made about a 20% tip off of me.  Conclusion -- not the best sushi, not great service, pricey for what you get. It's unfortunate that I'll have to drive 30-40Km out of Bradford to get better sushi.  Best LUNCH All-You-Can-Eat sushi that I've had so far is Diamond Sushi in Barrie (they have better rolls, and Beef Short Ribs). $13.99 per adult Mon-Thurs for lunch, which is $15.81 after HST."}
{"text":"We stumbled into Akita because Hiro had line out the door and I was impatient and figured we could drive across the street and get Miso soup and a roll.   Everything about Akita had feel of cheap Chinese all you can eat buffet.   If youre a college kid or wanna stuff yourself because you just got out of prison...fine.. but dont go here on date night.   I am shocked this place gets decent reviews when there are quality sushi places in SCOTTSDALE.   ( Hiro ) .  From reading reviews, there apparently is demand for cheap,  warm,  raw fish with bathrooms decorated like a cave ( wtf? why would anyone post a pic of a toilet on a review of a Sushi restaurant ? )  and this restaurant fills that unique niche.    The fish was sliced razor thin on the rolls. I could actually see through the tuna on the whatever-it-was roll.   The rolls were not cold and crisp and no flavor as youd expect.  Couldn't finish the miso soup, tofu was tiny squares like youd get out of packaged miso at grocery.  My lovers eyes were a whirlwind of pain as she chewed slowly and smiled politely, and I knew my haste was responsible for her suffering.   I had to avert my gaze and fixated on the water bucket Dad had hidden in the hallway he was using to rinse the bus rag ( like listening to a mop bucket during dinner? )  and how the son had filthy jeans on like he worked construction earlier in the day.  Mom was shuffling around in her new pink crocs.  Ditto on everyone in the family tripping over themselves to handle the tables and getting orders mixed up.   Meal is $20 for all you can eat which would be two rolls to break even but we couldn't finish what we ordered.  Next time Hiro is packed Ill goto Frys grocery and eat in, their sushi is much fresher and more flavorful."}
{"text":"I loved the Sushi here, but unfortunately some of the staff members are really rude ! I use to really like this place but it seems that you give their staff way too much trouble when asking them for anything.  Please do your job, or find a new one."}
{"text":"This place is just meh. I've definitely had better sushi. I feel like I'm always being rushed here and the waitress' are quite rude.   The quality of the food isn't the greatest. I feel as if most of the time they warm up left overs. For me it's not worth the drive (I live in Toronto), I can find better quality sushi in Toronto.   I'm also not very fond of the 10% service charge that we're automatically charged. I mean is that a tip?"}

{"text":"If I could rate this place any lower I would. Upon arrival for the $13dollar lunch buffet, I ordered then went to the restroom. As soon as I walked in the restroom there was a foul smell. Out of the two stalls one contained unflushed feces and the other vomit. I wanted to leave right then and there but as soon as I got back to my table the appetizers were there. The avocado salad that I ordered had an eyelash stuck to the side of the bowl. I pointed It out to the waiter, who quickly took It back to counter. I watched as he dug is finger into the bowl to retrieve the hair, wait around and tried to give It back to me. Hell no. I gave It back and told him that I didn't want It. Nigiri came out and fish was warmer than room temperature. That is a food hazard for sure. Not worth the risk even for 13 bucks. Diner beware   Forgot to add: the people making the sushi we're running back and forth from their lunch table and making sushi. I sat at the sushi bar watching them go back and forth eating, on their phone and eating with their hands without washing their hands when they came back to make the sushi rolls. They did put gloves on but definitely didn't see them wash their hands."}

Their all you can eat sushi is a deal and they have a lunch and dinner menu.   Lunch-$12 Dinner- $20  Definitely worth the cost.  Check it out.   All you can eat includes... Appetizers, soups, variations of noodles and fried rice and of course sushi.... Ohh wait don't forget ice-cream and fried bananas!!!!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan. First, when we walked in, no one greeted us, although several staff members did give us sideways glances. After a few minutes one of the waiters seated us. Several minutes later the waiter came back to take our drink orders. We told him that this was our first time here and asked how it worked. We were told to help ourselves to any food coming by on the conveyer belt and we would be charged for it at the end. Then we asked for the prices and he pointed to some different colored plates on the wall with prices written on them. So it was something like $2 for a pink plate and $5 for a black plate, etc. The prices seemed reasonable.   The food coming around on the conveyor belt was mostly pieces of rolls. We tried some and it ok, nothing to brag about. The problem was the same stuff kept coming around and some of it looked like it had been there awhile. Also, there was no traditional nigiri sushi on the conveyor belt and we were tired of California rolls, so we flagged our waiter down and asked for menus. He brought them and when we tried to flag him down again to order the Manager or Owner (someone more important) came over and informed us that they were not doing menu service, only conveyor service. When we said that after being there for over 20 minutes we still did not see what we wanted coming by on the conveyor and we just wanted some nigiri sushi, he said ok, ok I will get it for you. I think he was trying to please us, but instead of nigiri sushi we got sashimi, again, it was ok. The food was actually kind of boring.   Overall, this was not the sushi experience we had been looking forward to. The quality of the food was a little low and the hospitality of the staff was missing."}
{"text":"I didn't eat from their AYCE menu this time (I have in the past, a few years ago, but it's been a long time so I don't think it's relevant) , so my review is not regarding that. I ordered the shrimp tempura roll and sushi pizza, both of which were priced reasonably in that their prices are on par with the other sushi restaurants I frequent. Their decor was modern and clean - I really liked it.   However, their food left quite a bit to be desired. I came early in the evening on a Wednesday, so they weren't very busy (probably 3 tables were occupied). Their food didn't taste very fresh. The shrimp tempura rolls were pretty good. However, the sushi pizza tasted off and wasn't the best.   I've had better sushi for the same price. However, due to the convenient location and good hours (they open until 11pm from Monday to Saturday), I will probably be back. But I just don't recommend them if you could eat at another place."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've eaten here and overall I didn't think it was a bad place. It's very inexpensive and one of the only all-you-can-eat places in the area. The service is decent but can get VERY slow once there are a few full tables.  The BIGGEST area of concern is the fact that there was a LIVE ROACH in the hallway right outside of the kitchen AND another one inside the women's bathroom. This is unacceptable in a restaurant and should be taken care of. Definitely not sure if they would pass a health inspection. That is the last time I will be eating there."}
{"text":"Excellent food both in quality and taste. Prices were about normal for a all you care to eat establishment. Staff was friendly and non-judgmental of selections...  When it comes to Sushi this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Let's see $13 for lunch and $20 for dinner, oh did I mention it's all you can eat!!!!  Went here for both lunch and dinner but obviously dinner is worth it if you like sashimi. But their nigiri don't have much rice on them either. There sushi stuff is pretty good. Their Las Vegas roll comes out piping hot.   I don't suggest getting Raman udon or fried rice. It's very very bland and just bleh. Their appetizer are okay but obviously I'm here for the sushi.  They also include 3 different flavored ice cream: green tea, mango, and vanilla.  Don't forget about the fried banana, my friend got it and said it was good.  The only thing preventing a 5 star is their service. It's not that organized and can be a bit slow. But whatevs the food is good!"}
{"text":"My gf and I came here after a night of drinking and ordered the all you could eat. I probably ate 4-5 rolls alone.  It was so good. I got my 20 bucks worth.  Not sure my gf did.  But I would recommend it and plan to return!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi for $20? In Scottsdale? Unreal. I love sushi and I was blown away by the quality for the price. I love that you can order in whatever quantity that way you can try new things without commitment. Honestly, this will likely be my go to sushi place for now on."}
{"text":"0 stars! This place is terrible!!! They use canned fished. Save yourself the ick factor and go across the street to Hiro Sushi instead."}
{"text":"i've been to akita twice, both times we had great service, sushi was fresh and you can't beat the price. $12.00 all you can eat at lunch."}
{"text":"Decent sushi a fair price! I tried a fair amount of \"common\" dishes and was fairly impressed. I had apps, dinner, and desert. The rolls were widely cut and more filling than expected.  The green tea ice cream was indeed delicious, the fried bananas were okay, I liked the chocolate sauce ones best. The fish was cut well and was good quality. I did not see how much the \"all you can eat\" costs but I luckily arrived in time for lunch and it is priced as 12.99 .  The green iced tea was pretty good very green, and my server was better as time went on"}
{"text":"They've been closed for renovations for awhile now. I guess they decided that all the coupons that they distributed in the area would cost them too much money so they closed shop under the renovation pretence. Coupons have now expired so they'll probably open back up soon. Too bad for them we found another sushi place that is much better and cheaper (and no added automatic tip)."}
{"text":"Far and away the best sushi for the price.  Always freshly prepared but it's all you can eat for $12.  I don't know how they do it but I'll just keep going!!  Great sides, desserts and tea too!!"}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and 2 yr old for lunch.  The place is big and they have a revolving track for sushi.  I don't think they use it anymore.   Back to lunch. The server handed us a menu and we looked at it.  There were no prices.  I asked our server why there went any prices.  She told us, everything on the menu is ayce and it's $11.99.  I could not believe it .  This menu had sushi, tempura, soups, salads and many more items.  Now let me just say that when you order sushi it's by the piece, as well as there temura.  Sushi and rice ratio is perfect. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that they don't have scallops for sushi.  Dinner is $19.99 and is a way bigger menu with sashimi on it. If you're in the neighborhood you should really check this place out.  It's only an ayce place, so don't think you can go in and buy one item because you will be paying full price for the ayce."}
{"text":"So nothing particuarly special about this sushi restaurant. The inside is nicely done, modern, clean lines, vivid green lights. Crowd is typical Woodbridge scene. No Dragon Rolls unfortunately.. The Rainbow Roll is the closest thing to it. The teriyaki was really good, and all the rolls were pretty basic. I went in for lunch, it was $12.99, and dinner is 25 I think. The lunch and dinner menus could also be different... Maybe explaining lack of Dragon Rolls?  Oh ya, and they don't do the 10% tip thing anymore..."}
{"text":"The food is diverse and good tasting. All you can eat is really inexpensive to have a big dinner!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi at an unbeatable price! The service was great. Very friendly waiters. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This is genuinely the best susshi place I've been too! I haven't been to too many, but this is the best place for all you can eat!    Lunch is $11.99 and dinner is $20. It is the entire menu, which includes, but not limited to yakitori, teriyaki, edamame, gyoza (pot stickers), dessert, and, of course, sushi! It not only is cheap (for lunch at least, average for dinner), but it is all you can eat and is incredibly fresh! It tastes so good! I've been here probably 7+ times and have never had a bad experience! Plus beer, wine,  hot sake and other drinks are buy one get one for 99 cents. This place is seriously the best. When I go back home for the summer I don't know what I'm going to do for my sushi needs!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Everyone there are so friendly. The way they present their food to us are beautifully done and delicious!"}
{"text":"Dined here for AYCE lunch.  The food was okay, definitely edible but I would not return for a few reasons: - service is terrible.  there were no more than 9 tables in this restaurant the entire time we were there. there were 4 waitresses plus two men that were at the front hostess stand. there were 4 sushi chefs at the bar preparing the food.  the waitress complained when we asked for our rolls to be made without tobiko. she said they were too busy for such special orders. she was super rude about it and pretty sure we were saving them time by eliminating an ingredient and pretty sure 4 chefs can handle making food for 9 tables over the course of an hour and a half.  not to mention they were all standing around chatting the whole time and never even came to refill our drinks until we waved them over each time.  terrible service as the staff are clearly too lazy to earn their tip. - selection of food is limited especially the maki.  sushi pizza did not even look appetizing. there are definitely better sushi places in brampton including hocky sushi and 168.  The only good thing about this restaurant is that it is new and the decor is modern and nice.  Save your money and go eat AYCE some where else."}
{"text":"This is place is good, for the price. It's definitely not the greatest sushi I have ever eaten, I am kind of a sushi snob though. The quality of sushi is just OK, but when you only pay $13.50 for all-you-can-eat (this is a lunch special), I guess you can't really complain about the quality haha. Anyway, I would recommend this place if you need a quick sushi fix for cheap. But, if you do have the money to spend on higher-quality sushi, definitely do it! You're not really missing out on much here.  Also, the servers are nice, but service overall is pretty slow, which is kind of annoying."}
{"text":"It's always iffy trying an unfamiliar sushi place for the first time, especially when you invite coworkers out for lunch and feel the responsibility of selecting a good restaurant. Thankfully, Akita did me proud.   The service was quick, the price was great ($12.99 All-You-Can-Eat), and the rolls were fresh and delicious.   Being a vegetarian I know I don't get the full sushi experience, but the avocado roll was great and the tofu sushi was as good as everywhere else. I just wish they had a tofu roll (so few places do!). My coworkers  seemed to enjoy their fishier selections, along with their teppanyaki and teriyaki.   We plan on making lunch at Akita a monthly tradition!"}
{"text":"I'm here at least twice a month. By \"all you can eat\" they really mean \"all you care to eat,\" as they do warn that they'll charge extra for negligent over ordering, but I've never seen that become a problem. For $20 a dinner, I definately get my money's worth - and it includes sashimi! The sushi rolls are great, they also have things like gyoza, fried scallops and crab wontons, as well as some udon and soba.   The atmosphere is great, the restuarant isn't too big on the inside and you do get a lot of families and groups of people, but it's never been loud or hectic. On top of that the service is effecient and quick.   The ordering style is a fill it out yourself form where you mark down the queantity of items you want - and get this - the menu they hand out actually has pictures of EVERYTHING, so there's no confusion as to what you're getting. AND YOU CAN KEEP ORDERING. It's amazing.  Don't forget the green tea ice cream!"}
{"text":"I have frequented this place the past few months. As I was finishing dinner with my mom an employee walked up to us and informed us we had ordered too much food and that there would be an extra charge.  I was completely taken aback. At an all you can eat restaurant there is a penalty for having leftovers?  He continued to explain that they discourage people from ordering too much food and that next time I should pace myself because there are third world countries...I politely cut him off and asked him where the notice of this extra charge was.   I have been in the food service industry for almost 6 years I have never experienced more disrespect and outright terrible service. I was embarrassed (everyone in the section looked over at us) and I will never come back to the restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"The first Akita location (Woodbridge) has a steady clientele, so I was excited when one opened in Brampton. With the same decor and same menu selection, you would expect the same kind of service? But not with this location.  I've probably been there a total of 4 times and I would never go back. I've even brought parties there on a few occasions, whom at the time were impressed. The fish was of good quality and the service was fast and catered to us well.   Any time I go there as a couple, it has been quite the opposite. My last visit was a weekday lunch, and we ordered off the dinner menu (being a big sashimi fan). Salmon was not acceptable, it was not very cold and a few pieces were very rubber-like. Ordered grilled mussels, but I was surprised when it came with melted cheese on top, because it isn't specified on the menu. The idea of cheese and seafood was not a good idea. It was also hard to find one of 4 servers for tea refills because 3 of them were on a lunch break, where the fourth was I don't know. Also being approached by different servers asking if we had already ordered is a bit annoying, they need better communication.   On top of this was the automatic 10% gratuity that is added to every bill, no matter how many in your party. That must be a joke right?"}
{"text":"Glad we found a place like this. Once you sit down, everything is great. The key word is \"once\". The staff was a little tight but otherwise the sushi and sashimi were wonderful."}
{"text":"Akita Sushi was dIrty, sticky menus, unfriendly to the point of rude waitresses AND poor quality sushi... don't waste your time with Akita Sushi... make the drive down to Newmarket to Golden Maki on Leslie, worth the trip."}
{"text":"We can in for my Mother's Birthday lunch. This was our 2nd visit here. The first time we came in the service was not so great but we did sit in the corner and maybe they did not see us very well. This visit was so much better our order was put in quickly and our waters were refilled without us waving anyone down."}
{"text":"I don't trust Yelp reviews and ratings ever again! It's either people who are amazed with the food here have no taste at all or the quality of food has gone down hill and they caught me on a bad day. Forget fresh and prepared to order, almost everything I tried was not fresh and has been sitting in the kitchen for a while before it was served. I'm not going to waste my time and go into details, I'll just say that the shrimp was fried the day before and served the day after that! I'll leave it here, without even mentioning anything about the server and the service he provided.  I'd rather pay an extra 10 bucks on top of the 21$ and get a decent meal elsewhere! Oh the mango ice cream was nice lol"}
{"text":"There is no better sushi for this value in all of Arizona!  Stumbled across this gem about 3 years ago and even though it's a trek for me from home I won't eat Sushi elsewhere.  I've introduced this place to several other locals who also are now convinced no need to go elsewhere!  Food is fresh, expertly prepared and tastes incredibly good with an amazing variety.  This is my go to 2nd date location, ya know when you've already met and decide he's worthy of the introduction to a quality place!  Service is on point too!  Definitely check out the interesting bathroom too!  Come hungry and leave very content!!"}
{"text":"Good food, enjoyed every dish we ordered. Best was  crazy volcano.... Followed by Rainbow roll..."}
{"text":"My friend had an hour lunch and I took her there for her birthday. It took them over a half hour just to get us drinks (she had WATER) and when our food came after 40 minutes it was only the food that I ordered. I saw my food sitting in the window for almost 10 minutes. My friends order NEVER showed up. I offered her some of my food. When we complained they did not take her charge off the bill because they said that she ate my food!!! I was furious.  I said over and over again that she did not get her meal and he just kept repeating back to me that she ate. The bill ended up being $28 and I will never EVER go back there again.  Thanks for ruining her birthday lunch and CHARGING me for it!!!"}
{"text":"This was good. Really good. We went after lunch hour and it wasn't too crowded. Dishes came out quickly. Red Snapper rolls were my favorite. We also loved the Philly rolls. Assorted tempura had a little grease in the bottom of the basket but it didn't taste greasy. This will be my new go to Sushi spot!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant by reading other reviews in yelp! We are not going back again. There is no quality, all the sushi's has so many rice with it and nothing looks like the actual picture or the order ingredients! For example, I ordered the vegetable fried udon and there was no vegetable there all undo! This place is good if you are looking to eat as much as u want without caring about the quality."}
{"text":"Glad to have found this place!  Reasonably priced. It's an ayce sushi place but all made to order!  Plus, it's not just sushi but they offer a variety of tempura, Katsu cutlet, udon & soba noodles, teriyaki beef, chicken or salmon plus more menu items!  There's enough variety for our picky family. Loved the Rainbow roll, Manhattan roll & Volcano rolls. Wished there was one in Los Angeles.  Note: honorable mention for awesome decor of bathroom!"}
{"text":"Was in town for Spring Training.  Friend's son, 24, recommended all you can eat sushi for $20 dinner.  We looked at each other and decided what the heck, we'd try it.  We had great service.  A little slow as the restaurant got busier, but enjoyed everything we tried. We left extremely full and happy to try something new.  Excellent value for the $.  We're still talking about an all you can eat sushi place!"}
{"text":"Love this place.....the sushi is soooo good here. Its unfortunate I dont live in AZ.  I will definitely be visiting when I come bk  to AZ. The people are friendly and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times for sushi and I have really enjoyed it! I think the prices are great, especially the all you can eat lunch option. The appetizers are also very good and affordable."}
{"text":"Be very careful about this place if you order take out sushi and sashimi they will serve you the cheapest pieces of sushi and sashimi is you love processed crap meat this place is horrible i went two times the first was not so bad but the second was horrible i can get better sushi in a grocery store for real"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi lunch for $13.50, excellent bang for your buck!   Price includes appetizers, soups/salads, all kinds sushi, undo noodles, to deserts.  Best to go with a group of friends and share everything."}
{"text":"This is my favorite buffet style sushi place.  The fish is very good.  You get appetizers for one price. Lunch does not offer sashimi BUT dinner does.  The dinner price is twice the price of lunch.  Overall I have been here maybe nearly 10 times since moving to Arizona 8 months ago.  And overall it's a solid 3 stars. The things I don't like is every time I order spicy salmon or spicy tuna or spicy fish it comes with tempura flakes and it's kind of lacking in the raw fish department.  I learned that the best way to order sushi, is by ordering a hand roll.  If you want sashimi, you will have to wait for dinner.  The place is worth the trip if you need a quick raw fish fix or you want to entertain more than one friend."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for an all you can eat lunch.  It was better than expected with a few very unique and delicious items on the menu.  Everything was incredibly fresh and tasty, service was prompt and friendly.  Someone else mentioned no dragon rolls - the dinner menu is different and does have dragon rolls, more rolls than the lunch menu, sashimi and some other options.  \"salmon on chips\" and \"butterfly cheese\" were pretty darn delicious!  One negative is they add the tip on to your bill, which I detest, because this just makes me feel like you don't care one bit what type of service you provide me with - the lady working cash actually scoffed at me when I wrote ZERO on the tip line when paying with my credit card."}
{"text":"I grew up in the area, and drove by this location on Via Linda and 90th almost every day since I was 10 years old. In the last 20 years, this building seems to have the worst luck in the world. It's been several different restaurants over the years, none of which seemed to be particularly successful.   I LOVE sushi. I tried Teharu further north at FLW and the 101 and really liked the revolving concept--it was cheap and FAST. Perfect for a quick lunch when you've got a packed day. The sushi there was kinda mediocre, though, so I really only go in anymore when I need that FAST lunch. I was really excited to try Akita to see if they did any better.   The first time I went in was within the first two weeks they were open. I was really pleasantly surprised. The prices were almost double what you'd see at Teharu for some things, but the portions were larger and the quality and freshness were much higher. I went in several times after that and really enjoyed each time--the bad luck of this building made me want to go in and spend money there as much as possible...   In July, when I finally managed to get my mom over there with me to try it, we were disappointed to see they had just started the all-you-can-eat thing on Sundays and Mondays (it was lunch on a Sunday). While our food was good, it took forever and we had many different servers handling our orders. We eventually got everything we asked for, but it was not the experience I went in there expecting from my many lunch visits. And now, I'm reluctant to go back... I loved the revolving-ness of it for the speed and ability to just pluck up what I want and tally up my plates. Good, fast easy lunch. But if they're going to make me waste my already short lunchtime waiting for the menu items, then I might as well just stay on the freeway for a couple more exits and go to Teharu instead.   All in all, if anyone from Akita is listening--I've been in your place enough to be called a \"regular\" and I really don't think you gave the revolving thing enough time or effort. I'm sure there are ways to figure out what your bestselling items are, and keep those on the conveyor in smaller quantities to avoid waste and then allow people to order those items not on the conveyor a'la carte if they want them. I don't want you to close down--I love your food. But I HATE that you gave up and started the \"all you can eat\" thing. I think it's a big mistake and I will NEVER come in for the all-you-can eat again. If I walk in and the belt's not moving, I'm walking right back out.   Good luck--again, GOOD sushi. Poor strategy. I'd stay away from the all-you-can-eat, but if the belt's moving, it's a treat. :)"}
{"text":"Worst ayce sushi. Only brings half of a big order. Fish was not fresh. The only thing they could not mess up was the sashimi. The nigiris were mainly a rice ball, 2x the rice of the average nigiri. Was charged $3 for the left over rice. Never returning again."}
{"text":"Great sushi in Scottsdale! I'd give it ten stars. They have everything from calamari to nigiri to udon soups and green tea ice cream! Nomnom!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful (and cheap!!) all you can eat sushi.  If you don't have visual expectations, but appreciate very fresh raw fish, this is the perfect place for you.  I don't mind if the rolls look sloppy. They are tasty and fresh, and you can't beat the price.  The sashimi and salads are great but an absolute favorite of mine is their teriyaki eggplant. if you're and eggplant fan, you must order this dish. The shrimp tempura was just ok. I would skip next time. Just a little warning: you will get charged for food that you don't finish, so order a little each round."}
{"text":"First time at the place. Price is a bit expensive, maybe ok for a sushi. Food is ok, some very tasty.  The grade is most related to the bad service. Even the manager/owner is not so nice. We just moved to Bradford, I told my wife it will take a long time before I try again. Better gead to Newmarket to get a decent japanese food."}
{"text":"Meh.  Typical AYCE sushi place. Sushi was okay, nothing to die for. Lots of variety, don't eat their fruit sushi. It's gross. Hand roll are full of rice instead of the toppings. Their sashimi... I high doubt is fresh. Well their tuna sashimi wasn't but salmon was great.   Service... oh my. Came during 2ish and their were 3 groups of people. There were moments where there was no staff to be seen anywhere. They were literally hiding in the kitchen. It was weird and such a bad memory. Looking around for someone, and seeing them all in the kitchen hiding and you knew they were there 'cause you would hear them speak and laugh (loud). Than one in a while one or two of them would pop their heads out to see if anyone needed help.  Overall, bad experience the first time around. Maybe I was unlucky. Not sure, but I rather drive east and give Naha Sushi a visit."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Seriously I am telling everyone to go here. You will have great fresh sushi without paying the typical high Scottsdale price. The white tuna is delicious. We also get crab wontons and they are amazing. Everything else we have tried is great but those are our favorites. They don't have any really fancy or exotic rolls but they have everything traditional. I was concerned that at the price point (13 lunch and 20 dinner) the food would not be fresh. It is and this is our 6th trip here in the last 2 months. I won't go anywhere else for sushi even though there are several places closer to us. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Quality sushi for the price. This is our go to spot for ayce- has variation of rolls, specialities, sashimi, & nigiri and non-fish items for those who don't eat fish!"}
{"text":"There is definitely an upside and downside to this spot. The upside is that you can get a ton of food at a fair price ($14 lunch). The downside is that there is such thing as too simple. Order a \"crab roll\" and what comes in it? Crab. That's it. No cucumber, avocado, or anything else. I'm a big fan of cheap sushi but I also like it to be pretty decent with maybe a few veggies in the roll. I would recommend a Teharu type rotating place over this if you want cheap sushi. At least they put more than one ingredient in their rolls."}
{"text":"This place was amazing and cheap!! Ate all you can eat sushi for lunch for under 20 dollars. I was in shock. The service and quality of everything I ordered was phenomenal. Will be back !!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite AYCE sushi place, even with the horrid service. Now, the sushi rice is drenched in rice vinegar and incredibly mushy. The fish has an off taste and smell to it. What you order is NOT what you get. I ordered the enoki mushroom beef roll and not only was the mushroom substituted with asparagus, but the meat was almost charred and tasted like dog food. The miso soup was cold, as was most of the hot items. As for the service, it's always been absolutely horrendous - food constantly forgotten or the wrong thing is sent to us, the waitresses always act and look like that absolutely hate you and wish they could be anywhere else. The lovely cherry on top? They add a 10% tip on your bill no matter what. When we brough up our complaints, we were met with the traditional AYCE sushi response: our food is good, you don't know what your talking about. Gotta love those responses before being forced to pay for food that gets you food poisoning."}
{"text":"Decent little place in Woodbridge. Not the greatest or freshest Sushi. Servers were the best part of the visit and they weren't even great. The only drawback as well is that when you order a number of things they always tend to forget a couple of your orders and they never end up coming.   We've visited Akita numerous times and with every single visit we can probably point out a few things we've ordered that were never brought to our table.  They also don't seem to listen very well when ordering. We give them the exact pieces we want for the single orders and they always seem to not get it right. They bring you the heavy stuff first so you can get full faster which is not fun if you're at an ayce joint. This place can definitely get better.   Also the design is very weird, a bunch of hockey stuff for an Asian restaurant, it is cozy though."}
{"text":"Sashimi is really nice and unlimited. However the buffet sushi is not that impressive."}
{"text":"The AYCE is reasonably price and excellent service. Would come again especially to bring my young kids that only eat tekka maki, shrimp tempura, and yakitori... and of course fried banana with chocolate drizzle and ice cream. The sushi vinegar could be better and more specialty rolls"}
{"text":"We've been going here at least once a week.  The food is prepared after you order it (not a buffet) which makes the food very fresh and delicious..  I love the fact that it's all you can eat!!  I'm addicted to the teriaki salmon as it\"s crispy on the bottom...the teriaki japanese  eggplant is fabulous...they said they cook their teriaki sauce for 8 hours, and you can tell because it's like no other!!.  My husband does not eat sushi and there's plenty for him to order.  We highly recommend this restaurant...and we pray they stay in business for years and years!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has really, really good sashimi, nigiri and sushi rolls. The only thing is they have some Americanized rolls here... if you're looking for seriously authentic sushi this place is where to go imo. This place has good ratings on google I was surprised to see some of the bad reviews on yelp. The service is fine, wait staff was attentive and we are always seated quickly. Will be returning many times."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch again, but the service this time was unacceptable. We initially submitted a large order but half of the rolls we ordered were lost. After submitting another order, more items were unaccounted for. It's really frustrating because I was in a hurry that day.   Previously, they gave us too much food. How hard is it to count?  If you have time to burn, you can come here and have them lose your order."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend found this place during a fast online search for sushi. I'm super happy we decided to give it a try because it was so worth it!  okay so basically as of 6/11/16 the lunch price is $12.99 and dinner $21 for all-you-can-eat sushi plus other food on the menu(A LOT MORE). The catch is that you have to eat it all with no waste otherwise they will charge for leftovers not consumed. That being said, I did notice they add a lot of rice to the sushi, but not overly crazy. I recommend ordering the 6 pieces instead of the 1 hand-roll since the handroll is 80% rice and fills you up faster and equal to 3 rolled pieces. The 6 piece rolls have more flavor and are actual sushi rolls.   Holy cow we had our fill and enjoyed it all:) We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"So, I went to Akita for the time last night, at the invite of some friends. I've been a huge fan of the all-you-can-eat sushi for some time and really stuck to one local place for my sushi dining. That has changed! Akita offers a huge selection of sushi, appetizers and desserts in their all-you-can-eat menu and at a cost that you would not believe! In a sitting, we would order about five rolls and they'd be at our table within 10 minutes. The staff were super friendly, the food was fast, fresh and very well made, and to top it off, it was affordable. I will absolutely be going back."}
{"text":"I experienced the WORST customer service at Akita Sushi.  We came in on Sunday with 7 people right as Akita Sushi opened.  We were seated immediately and the restaurant began filling up very quickly.  We placed our order and waited for our sushi.  We spent about 2.5 hours in the restaurant, and by the end, still did not receive all the items we ordered off the menu.  It was absolutely ridiculous.  It also didn't help that our waitress didn't speak any English, so it made the ordering experience much more difficult (even though we indicated everything we wanted on the sheet that we were instructed to fill out).  Anyhow, we placed the same order over and over again in hopes that we would get the food we wanted, but no luck.  We got a couple of sushi items we ordered but not all of them.  We kept bringing this to the attention of the waitstaff, but nothing was done about it.  After 2.5 hrs, we finally got impatient and left.  Not to mention, there were people that came in after us and left before us.  Not sure what was so complicated about a table of 7 people...  The sushi we received was decent, but NOT worth the overall experience.  There are a ton of great sushi places in Phoenix and Scottsdale.  Don't waste your time on this place.  Horrible, horrible experience."}
{"text":"Delicious all you can eat sushi for $21 (dinner)! This includes some appetizers and desserts! It really does satisfy the cravings! Quality of the sushi is pretty good and it's a plus that they don't pack each roll with alot of rice!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, high-quality sushi for an all you can eat price. A gem right across the street from me that I didn't even look twice at and now it'll probably be \"our spot\". We ordered like 6 rolls, chicken udon, and two orders of green tea ice cream and destroyed it all. Absolutely delicious. My favorite roll was the angry dragon. We'll probably be back sometime this week again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I haven't tried anything on their menu I didn't like yet. The staff is polite and friendly, and the service is very quick. Be sure to try their eggplant teriyaki - it's exceptional and I haven't had anything like it elsewhere. This is definitely my go to sushi place from now on!"}
{"text":"An ok deal for the price of $21 all you can eat, sO it gets the extra star.  Service is quick but don't expect quality sushi.  Spicy Tuna looked like there was some filler of some sort added to the fish.  If you come here stick to sashimi and if you are craving rice get a side of rice to go with it.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I honestly don't even know where to begin. We ended up at Akita tonight based on yelp reviewers stating that it's $11.99 all you can eat Sat-Mon. It was a toss up between Geisha's awesome Sunday specials and this. We decided to give someplace new a shot...  We sat down, all you can eat dinner menu in hand, no prices in sight, conveyer belt not on.. We ordered a few spring rolls, edamame, the pork cutlet, and a seaweed salad. The only thing that made it out was the salad... When it came to the sushi, every roll that should have been cold was warmer than room temperature (still crossing fingers that we don't get sick). I decided to try and order some appetizers again.. I ordered two spring rolls, two scallops, a calamari tempura and a shrimp tempura. We eventually got ONE spring roll, ONE scallop, and shrimp tempura... No calamari in sight. Okay... Wanting to at least end on a sweet note, we ordered the fried bananas and vanilla ice cream. My thought was to eat the fried banana WITH the ice cream, however, the bananas came out about 10 minutes after the ice cream, therefore, that was already demolished.   I felt that even with all of the screw ups, it was almost decent enough to be what I thought would be a $24 bill for two people. WRONG!!! To my surprise, dinner is apparently $19.99 a person, which nearly doubled my expectation. Knowing that I could have had an amazing meal at Geisha for half of what I paid is still not sitting well with me.   It is also worth noting that nobody that works here seems to know what they are supposed to be doing. We had three different people taking our orders, which probably explains why we didn't get half of our food. They should really think about giving customers an order sheet/pencil like most other sushi restaurants. It would probably make it much easier on the employees and give the customers a better experience. They should also, perhaps, post prices somewhere. Even if it's just on the big white hand written poster boards taped all over the building advertising the all you can eat special. There was no place to verify prices since there is no website either.   In conclusion, Akita really needs to get their sh*t together if they want to stay open. We definitely don't plan on going back anytime soon... If ever..."}
{"text":"YUM! Really love this place. The service was amazing and the fish was fresh. The sushi wasn't as inexpensive as some other Revolving Sushi Bars, but I enjoyed it much more. The fish was d-lish and the restaurant is beautiful. Definitely going to make it back."}
{"text":"The worst sushi I have ever had. I was hoping the quality for an AYCE wasn't going to be too bad. I was...disappointed. The rice was sour and far too al dente, the fish was poor quality, and the spicy yellowtail roll was inedible. Service was fine though."}
{"text":"This place is a dream come true to me. 12 bucks for unlimited amounts of everything on the menu. Obviously its not going to be the pinnacle of sushi but it's still tasty refreshing sushi. All the servers were very friendly and supportive of any egregious amount you want to order. Filling and satisfying. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this place."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and it is always great.  For $20 at dinner or $12 at lunch you get all you can eat sushi, apps, noodles, dessert, etc.  This isn't a buffet and you order whatever you would like off of the menu.  The food and service have consistently been very good.  All of the sushi tastes fresh and they have many special rolls that are included in the price.  Portion sizes are also good, but even if they were small you can order as much as you want.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys sushi."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi.  It's AYCE fished price for the entire menu.  You can also pay for the Dinner selection for lunch, which is what I always do, extra $8 for dinner selection, but you get unagi (eel) sushi, sashimi, and more specialty rolls.  Also you can get oysters.  There appeitizers are good and the portions are small for noodle/soup dishes and cooked dishes so that makes it easier to try several things.  Now is the sushi as good as Hiro downt eh street, no, but for the price the quality is higher than a AYCE Chinese place that servers sushi.  I'm a fan of both places."}
{"text":"Akita is one of the best tasting/quality sushi there is in Arizona . If you want genuinely fresh sushi that is ENDLESS for the delicious price of $12, this is the place . Service is fantastic and management is great . Definitely a go to"}
{"text":"Stopped by solo for lunch after class. Sushi is decent, service leaves a little to be desired. Everyone here appears to be Japanese, and some speak more English than others. Nothing wrong with that :-) i sampled several appetizers: gyoza (good), aged tofu (fresh out of the fryer, could use some salt), ans miso soup (actually just a tiny bit of broth...). Then i had the spicy salmon roll, that was interesting, taste and texture were not right, but the spicy tuna was decent. Not the best ever, but good. Then I handed in the next slip for one more roll and dessert.... The ice cream came before the roll or the  fried banana, green tea ice cream didn't taste like green tea. Kind of a weird sweet flavor. Vanilla ice cream with a little matcha mixed in, maybe? Tuna avocado roll was good when it came. Fresh tuna, equally sized piece of avocado, sea weed, and rice. The fried banana arrived last... Also fresh from the fryer and piping hot. And absolutely delicious!!! So for ayce but prepared to order sushi, this place is great. I'll be coming back.... But first I have to find someone to roll me out to my car :-D lol"}
{"text":"The restaurant states it has a revolving sushi bar but when a group of us went it was no longer available. I also herd that Akita Sushi had five health code violations on dirty dining!!"}
{"text":"Don't go to this place. Went on a Friday night price was $22.99 for adults and kids were $10.99, it was way over-priced for kids.  For the prices they charge maybe having something other than plastic cutlery would be appropriate. Food was average.  Service was terrible, very unfriendly. Our party was five people including two children and an automatic gratuity was added to the bill. We couldn't understand the bill and when it was questioned the person at the cash desk was extremely rude. The funny thing was she is the owner.   Will never be going back to this place."}
{"text":"Just left lunch there and I really only enjoyed the mint they gave me with my check. I had 2 speciality rolls and a squid salad all of which were fishy. I didn't finish one of the rolls and I eat just about anything! I have been to the other revolving sushi bars near this one for a quick and healthy lunch and will return to those but not this one. One plus is that they do have lots of speciality rolls."}
{"text":"Would not recommend going here for lunch .. Does NOT have unlimited sashimi at lunch time but the price is cheaper at $13.50 instead of $21.00 for dinner.   I wish I knew this going in because I would totally pay the extra money for the sashimi. The nigiri was NOT worth it at all. They slice their fish very thin and give you a regular portion of rice so it fills you up quick.   The rolls on the other hand were pretty good. Everything I ate was pretty fresh and tasty. Love the salmon skin hand rolls and the eel and avocado hand rolls.   I thought it was pretty neat that they have other items on their menu for non sushi eaters but I don't recommend that either. The fried scallop was fake scallop, the stir-fry beef udon literally came out with no beef and just taste like udon in soy sauce, the spicy udon came out tasty very strongly of Sriracha and it was luke warm...  the winner was the fried rice, can eat that all day.  Other than that, the food came out super quick and I love that there's ice cream on the menu.  Maybe I'll come back to try out the dinner for sashimi but this place is extremely far from me and did not leave a good impression already."}
{"text":"This place has great sushi! I went here before when it was a revolving sushi bar, it was still great sushi service was kinda slow.. so I expected that again BUT I got great service and great sushi for $20 each! Their rolls are unique and the fish is fresh. I will be making this my main sushi place from now on:)"}
{"text":"This place has great rolls and plenty of options!!  I love that they have a sushi buffet!! Especially because they have great rolls!! Love their Volcano roll and Las Vegas roll, and with that you must have a sake bomb! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for all you can eat sushi. Don't expect crazy roll creations. This is simple sushi, done well. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"What can I say great sushi gently revolving (yes i said revolving because that's what this place is a revolving sushi restaurant) by at a great price, this is one to check out"}
{"text":"This is my go to Japanese restaurant. It's all you can eat, $20/person and the food is so fresh and yummy. I love their sashimi, especially the White Tuna, seriously delicious. I would recommend this place to everyone who wants to stuff themselves with sushi and Japanese dishes."}
{"text":"Best all-you-can-eat sushi around! They have unique, fresh, quality rolls and sashimi. Most all-you-can-eat places have crappy little rolls and limit how many specialty rolls you can order - but not this place! I also love that they include appetizers, salads, soups and desserts on their all-you-can-eat menu, and you can order as little or as much as you want. This allows you to try a variety of different things without overindulging and for a great price.   The only reason I can't give them 5 stars is because the service can be quite slow when they are busy and they may forget to bring out part of your order all together! However, they do somewhat make up for this by allowing you to order as many rounds of food as you want."}
{"text":"Akita has great sushi! The price is great during the time of their specials. The food is always good. Servers are not bad, sometimes they're not as quick but overall it's a great place to eat."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner, party of 6, on a Friday night. Never been here before and heard pretty good things about it. It was pretty busy when we got there but there wasn't much of a wait we had like 2 parties before us, unfortunately we weren't seated in order. Since we had a bigger party, we had to wait almost an hour to be seated. There were like 4 parties that got seated before us on top of the 2 that was there before. I wish that they had a better system in seating big parties.  We were seated in a huge booth though, more than enough space for 6 people. Right away we filled out the paper to get our orders. I love the fact that the price of 20.99 (for dinner) included sashimi, nigiri, regular rolls, hand rolls, fried rice, chicken teriyaki, dessert and more....like ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT! I mean in our party of 6 we had one guy didn't eat and a child, so technically 4 adults eating. We kinda sucked because we only had like 2 rounds of food..  We did order 25 salmon and 25 tuna sashimi right away, and 20 salmon nigiri, plus like 5 other rolls, edemame, and cheese wontons (which were sooooo bomb).   At first, the server tried to tell my friend that he can't NOT eat (but he was full, he was just there to hang out). In the end, they didn't end up charging him, which was nice.   Ooohhh their mango ice cream was bomb!!! soo good def try it! Served in individual one scoop bowls but since AYCE u can order as many scoops as you want.  Anyways...def worth the money. Sushi qualitywise is pretty good for the price.  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed. Not fresh, the sushi is not very tasty and the udon beef was burnt and grisly. The waitress and service was nice, the atmosphere is okay too, but that food is awful! The only reason I ate the food was so I wouldn't get charged extra for ordering and not eating. I ordered fried bananas for desert and they were okay but very small and the way it was plated seemed like a joke. I will never be back and I am warning you that this is what you will find when you go to Akita sushi: old fish and disappointment."}
{"text":"The food was really good, so it is a shame that I have to only give this place 2 stars.   Service matters to me and this place has to have been the worst. From the moment we walked in and asked a question, the host yelled back at us $13.50!!!!! We weren't even asking about price. We should have walked out at that time but my daughter really wanted rolls for lunch.   The young lady that took our drink and food order was pleasant but we rarely seen her. When our food was brought to the table, it was dropped in front us and practically thrown on the table if you happened to be on the far side.   All in all, we got one order of the All You Can Eat sushi. We put in a second order but after waiting a half hour for it, I ended up just asking for the check. My kids had another order ready to go in for ice cream but it was pretty evident that would not be taken anytime soon and we were not about to wait another half hour for food that wasn't going to come out.  Needless to say, our Sunday lunch was ruined."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here.  The good:  Tried a bunch of different sushi, very fresh, very creative.  I recommend the sweetheart and valentine roils (I even hate typing the names, but they were good).  I didn't have the sashimi, but it looked nice with good portions.  The bad (ish):  The spicy tuna was lacking a little spicy.  But that's a preference thing.  What I really didn't care for was the arrangement of the place.  the revolving sushi is set up in the shape of an \"E\", with all of the seat as though you were sitting at the sushi bar.  One end of the E you are sitting at the bar, but the remainder you're looking across sushi parading by and into the eyes of another diner.  I was fortunate to have a couple of cute girls across from me - a plus - but one could envision situations that would be less pleasant.  The other place in town gets past this by putting tables that extend off of the revolving sushi conveyor, an arrangement I much prefer.  There were a few of these at Akita, but not many.  I'll be back, but either with a group so I get the table, or sit in front of the prep are (bar).  I certainly wouldn't want to be sitting across from another dude that looks like me...."}
{"text":"Ok... Whoever gave a good review for this place has obviously never had good sushi. We should have known better when we walked in and this horribly intense fish smell hits you in the face, but we stayed anyway and had the all you can eat lunch. The avocado in my roll was so hard you couldn't even eat it and most of it was black.  The fish was so far from fresh I almost threw up. None of the rolls we had were even worth eating.  Awful. Awful. Awful."}
{"text":"Really bad service. Feels like they don't want you there. Too bad this is the only sushi place in bradford. I would drive to maple sushi in aurora than eat here."}
{"text":"Good service, good food, good price. Let's keep things realistic. I came here for lunch AYCE sushi and it was $15 inclusive of tax and gratuity. Of course it's not going to be high end sushi. People complaining about the quality are trying to eat a filet on a burger budget. This is upper middle class type shit. I'm gonna fast for two days and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Not the best sushi, too much rice on rolls and such. Can't complain though, it was only $13 for all-you-can-eat! Can't find that anywhere else for that price in Arizona. Pretty good service as well"}
{"text":"came here for lunch and really enjoyed the food and service.   you get a variety of food options from the all you can eat lunch menu including appetizers, sushi, teriyaki, udon, asst'd fried rice, specialty rolls and desserts.    I can't believe they only charge $12.00 for lunch.   super friendly and attentive staff.  this is a great place for large groups and fun for kids.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Yesterday at Akita sushi was when I walked in i wasn't greeted immediately. I got sat down at a table and got handed a menu and I didn't see prices for the food so it had me really confused on the menu it didn't say it was $13+ for all you can eat. (Not a bad price) but I literally had no clue the prices. Being that it was my first visit there they should have asked me if I've been in before because I wasn't familiar with the menu and so I ordered a few rolls and the were only so so. There are other places in the neighborhood that are a lot better on the food quality and more friendly. I may give this establishment another chance but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Akita Sushi is an All You Can Eat Sushi establishment, and it is perhaps the best one I have ever been to in terms of value. The value is incredible, and the amount of options available is amazing. I believe the prices vary depending on which day of the week you visit, but it's always extremely reasonable for an AYCE made to order sushi joint. If you come hungry, you will leave very happy and very bloated.   The sushi is made to order, and there are lots of rolls to choose from, including some premium rolls that would be quite pricey at an average sushi place. The sushi itself isn't amazing by any sense, but it's decent enough, and it certainly gets the job done. You can also choose from other items such as tempura, soup, salad and dessert as part of the All You Can Eat menu. Like I said, the amount of options available is insane. Even people who don't like sushi will find something.  The service is quick, the staff is fantastic, and they NEVER give you any angry or disgruntled looks after you eat 9 rolls of sushi or however many you can fit inside your gut. Not only is this an ALL YOU CAN EAT sushi place with an amazing selection and acceptable quality, this is also a judgement-free zone. Phenomenal.   If you're looking for very high-quality sushi, Akita Sushi is not for you. There is much \"better\" sushi to be found. Please understand that. But if you're looking for decent-quality sushi at a great price, and you want to eat as much as you can with no restrictions whatsoever, Akita Sushi is absolutely a dream come true. It is one of the best restaurants in terms of value I have ever been to.   Akita Sushi gets 5 stars, and it is one of the easier 5 stars I have ever given. If you're ready to stuff your face with sushi, your search is over."}
{"text":"This place is awesome I warn you now as soon as you sit down order before they try and bring your drinks otherwise you will watch tons of food go by and it not be yours and then you get a funny feeling they forgot you but they get back logged quick and your wait can get strong otherwise this place is amazing and the Manhattan rolls are on point along with the shrimp tempora rolls etc etc... You get the point just try it and you will be hooked the owner is always in and super cool"}
{"text":"This is the first time for us in Akita sushi and definitely not  last . We are big fun of all you can eat sushi and especially when it is clean ,well manage place  Highly recommended ...."}
{"text":"On our trip to Phoenix, one of our five friends wanted to eat sushi, so of course we Yelped it. We found this all you can eat spot about half an hour away from our hotel. As we arrived, there was no wait to get in.  We sat down right away and ordered away. It seemed that we tried almost everything on the menu. There wasn't anything that we ordered that was old or not fresh. We had yellowtail sashimi which was my favorite.  The rolls were good as well. Our server, which was a younger Chinese girl was really nice and friendly.   If you want all you can eat sushi at a good price, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sushi in American culture is a type of food that is very unique, as it has no cultural direction. There are no strict rules that determine what makes good sushi, it is a category of food that is open to interpretation. There are many different variations of sushi that have popped up, including revolving conveyor belt sushi, high-end sushi that will break your wallet, and hole-in-a-wall sushi that might be good or bad. Akita has the best qualities of these restaurants, the authenticity, affordable pricing, perfectly contrived ambiance, and most importantly - delicious sushi.             The first thing that you notice is the pricing system, Akita can be either an a la-carte sushi restaurant, or it can be a buffet-style experience. You pay a set price, either $14 during the day or $18 during dinner hours. From there, you can order any role, in any amount, as long as your stomach is as big as your eyes, and you can eat everything you ordered (reasonably, you are charged for what you don't eat [which has never happened to me even though I couldn't eat a roll)]. This pricing system seems almost too good to be true, as at some other sushi restaurants you end up paying up to $14 for a single role. Usually, you can't order 6 Las Vegas rolls without wincing at the price, but at Akita this is encouraged. This is what differentiates Akita from all other sushi places, you walk away completely stuffed and happy, with the precious feeling of knowing you got exactly what you paid for. This begs the question - is this sushi really that good? The simple answer is yes. It beats out any revolving sushi place, and in my opinion is the same quality as restaurants such as Ra and Sushi Brokers.  Their menu is also overwhelmingly large, and every time I go I end up trying something new that I enjoy (You absolutely must try to green tea ice cream, it's my all-time favorite flavor - anywhere). My favorite rolls that I recommend are the crazy volcano roll, the out of control roll, the XS roll, and sweet heart role. There are however, some rolls that I question why they are on the menu at all. There are rolls such as the asparagus and tuna rolls, which only contain rice, seaweed, and their respected ingredient. As long as you stay clear of these extremely bland rolls, you will have a great experience.             The other aspect of dining that Akita nails is the ambiance. The restaurant has selected calming colors, red and black primary with smooth oak accents throughout the restaurant. I cannot speak about its Asian authenticity, but personally I absolutely love the atmosphere that Akita has created. Another thing which must be mentioned is the bathrooms. Out of all high-end restaurants including Mastro's, Fleming's, Ocean Prime, Durant's, etcetera, their bathrooms all pale in comparison to Akita's.             Lastly, the staff is incredibly friendly and quite speedy. You're never waiting for water, and it feels like you have a never-ending supply of sushi while you're seated. I've only been to Akita five times, and one of the waiters remembered my name, and we had a conversation about our dogs!             This might be a long-winded and seemingly exaggerated review, but Akita deserves every word. They are home to the most-affordable and delicious sushi in Phoenix, the green tea ice cream would have sold me alone. They have earned a life-long customer, and I encourage anyone reading this to go to the restaurant as soon as possible. I also recommend eating lightly prior, as you will want as much room in your stomach as possible!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat decent sushi at a fantastic price. The ambience is nice enough for a business lunch and great to take the kids. I've been here several times and the experience has always been very good.  I always sit at the sushi bar so I don't have any complaints about the speed of service."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place. Owners were very friendly and social without being overbearing. Service was fast and well timed. Good fish quality for the best price in town!!!!!"}
{"text":"A decent all you can eat sushi place. It is fairly standard in menu and nothing special about it. Service is not bad but I've had a few bad servers and they often forget things you ordered or don't bring it all if you order a lot."}
{"text":"Drove up to Phoenix for a few days and came across this sushi restaurant, BEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO ME. The All you can eat sushi caught my attention. The service was great, the atmosphere was very laid back and enjoyable. Probably the best quality sushi I've ever had & I've had a lot of sushi in my life. Started off with a seaweed salad and miso soup, so delicious! Got a few rolls and ended with a bowl of beef Udon. I would definitely drive 2 hours to have dinner at this place, so worth it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent AYCE lunch. This restaurant exceeded our expectations and we eat a lot of sushi. The service was really fast, even though, the menu warns that food may be slow because it's made to order.  Great selection on the menu too including a variety of sushi hand wrapped rolls, udon, appetizers and teriyaki. We live in Ahwatukee, but we will definitely make the drive again."}
{"text":"Pro:  An amazingly low price for all-you-can-eat, with a very good variety on the menu. Con: You get what you pay for.   I tried the sushi, sashimi, rolls, and udon, and found the quality to be sub-par.  Probably best for a quick lunch stop.  Also, take note that this is no longer a conveyor-style restaurant, contrary to what it says in some listings."}
{"text":"$13.50 for all you can eat lunch.  I had reservations about it but I'm glad I came.  There's a front and back menu with lots of items to choose from.  The fish was pretty fresh, and I enjoyed the rainbow roll and spicy tuna roll.  They can make you either cut or hand rolls.  The tempura scallop and shrimp were not good.  They tasted like they were made from fish.  I thought yakitori was typically grilled, but it looked like they just threw it in a dryer.  Was pretty oily so I left it on the plate.  I would stick with sushi here as it's the best bet."}
{"text":"I went in with my family asked for a booth and an Asian couple that we had just seen in another restaurant came in and they were seated immediately .... I confronted the owner and he denied and said they had a reservation when I had just seen the couple at another restaurant..  do not visit this restaurant if you have respect for equality of all people ... sad that my two kids had to experience this...."}
{"text":"You can't beat the price for the sushi and the portions are good. Did I mention it's all you can eat!"}
{"text":"Really great value \"all you can eat.\" Unlike most places, they offer sashimi as an option for all you can eat, so you're more than capable of getting your money's worth."}
{"text":"One of my favorites when it comes to sushi. All you can eat, made to order QUALITY sushi. Service is pretty good, and the food is always on point. Their fried rice is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is a great AYCE sushi place. The food quality is good and the service is good. Not the best in the area, but still better than most of them."}
{"text":"What did Sushi A say to Sushi B? \"Wasabi!\"  This AYCE (all you can eat) sushi will cost you $11.99 for lunch (without tax). That's right, you can't find another sushi place around town that will get you this great of a deal. The AYCE include appetizers, sashimi, specialty sushi rolls, teriyaki, tempuras, udon noodles, and dessert ice cream. Really, it's worth it.  I appreciate good sushi but I am definitely not super picky about the quality. With that said, the sushi rolls are pretty average but they have substance. They're not stuffed with rice like a lot of AYCE sushi restaurants to try and fill you. It's made to order, so they keep the rolls fresh."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. When we have out of town guest we always bring them here.  Thank you for always having great quality food."}
{"text":"The sushi here is okay, the service here sucks. I came in with a party of 4 for all you can eat sushi. We probably placed 3-4 rounds of orders with each person ordering 1-2 items. each time items would be missing from someone's order. We informed waitstaff and they appeared to be clueless. service is sooo slow we ended up staying at the restaurant for 2.5 hours before we started getting irritated and got up and left. Not worth coming here when there are better sushi restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Japanese restaurant that I've ever went to. Terrible service, dishonest checks with the tips mandatorly included. Be ready to be treated like garbage..."}
{"text":"Our server lost our order twice. It took an hour and ten minutes to get our sashimi. The table of very drunk twentysomethings behind us cussed nonstop the entire time we were here. And the movie of choice playing on the large screen televisions was Contraband with Mark Wahlberg, let's just say it is not a movie I would have selected for my four children."}
{"text":"This used to be our go to spot for sushi. We even introduced many friends and family to this restaurant, but tonight we walked in at 8:30 when the sign on their door says they close at 9. We sat down order our drinks and some appetizers. When our waitress came back  and asks us to \"hurry up and order because the kitchen will be closing soon\" If that's the case they should say they close at 8. If you are not willing to serve the guests that are in your restaurant then what's the point of being open. We quickly ordered what we wanted, and before we even got our food the buss boys were putting the chairs on top of the tables and making us feel very unwelcome. So we just won't go back. Their loss."}
{"text":"Wow. Not good, I can't even come up with a better statement than that. The sushi wasn't fresh..."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of five and this was my first sushi experience and the food was excellent... When it actually came.   Many things we ordered would never come to our table. We would have to remind them and order the items again.   The woman working was miserable and definitely did not want to be there which was unfortunate since I was really excited to try this place and we were there to celebrate.   It was very expensive ($31) and I of course tipped. I later read there was a 10% tip already added to the bill. The debit machine still did ask for a tip option mind you.   The price wouldn't of been an issue if the service was good and we actually got the food we ordered. I would of loved to try a few more thinvs  The food was amazing - which was kind of disappointing since I wouldn't want to go back there due to the service."}
{"text":"Sure the service is terrible but the all you can eat sushi is great. I am not a sushi connoisseur by a long shot, but I know when my food is fresh and prepared with care, and you get both at Akita.  Try to go before the dinner rush (5pm) and you'll have the undivided attention of the staff."}
{"text":"I was concerned when I saw this was a buffet. Much to my surprise the food is great and the service is fast and polite."}
{"text":"Sadly I had the same experience as the few others below. No revolving bar, no option other than all you can eat. Was told by the waitress that it was 9.95 for the all you can eat sushi. Seemed like plenty of servers and waitresses. Ordered drinks and food, never saw anyone after that. Flagged down servers and they said they'd put in our next order, but we never received it. Then while leaving, not 30 dollars for 3, instead it was almost 70! I complained to the head guy, he said \"oh yeah, I know. We had someone call in today.\" I said \"the price isn't right, the girl told us 10 per person.\" He said \"no, it's 20 plus tax\".   Do they have the term \"bait and switch\" in Japan? This was a horrible experience. I can't imagine returning."}
{"text":"I went to Akita Sushi a few years ago and gave it rave reviews, but things have changed.  Not nearly as fresh, and sushi rolls were essentially rice.  The service is still attentive, but the place has gone downhill.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for all you can eat lunch and it was incredible! I had the Sweetheart Roll it had Red belly tuna and spicy tuna drizzled with eel sauce and it melted in my mouth! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Always good!! Service gets slow sometimes but you know what it's because they get busy!! Stuff happens people!! Love this place."}
{"text":"Other than it was freezing inside everything was good. Their scallops are imitation though. All you can eat for $13, apps, sushi, soup, salads, desserts, and more. Our server was great."}
{"text":"$20 for dinner.  All you can eat . My friends  raved about this place . At $12.for lunch it is a bargain. We started  with their shrimp  tempura. It was very oily and too much breading. We had 4 rolls . The meat was too salty. On the spicy shrimp  and crab rolls. We had their  seafood fried rice which was  overcooked. And salty. Tried  the udon noodles which was tasty but the beef was way overcooked . I ordered  teriyaki  chicken and got salmon.  This was way overcooked.  The scallops  tasted like  artificial  crab. We tried the desert . Fried banana and mango ice cream.  The ice cream was  like a sorbet and the banana was oily . . They forgot one of our rolls with no apology.  If you like good sushi this is not the place for you"}
{"text":"Was very excited to try a AYCE sushi place but after eating here I'm quite disappointed.   Their raw sushi was not that fresh and it was very thin. I got so much rice that I couldn't even taste the raw fish. I order some rolls and honestly there was nothing special about their rolls either. If you're into those basic rolls like California, Las Vegas, and Spicy Tuna then this place is for you.   Although service was very great. Our waitress was very attentive and great.   I would recommend this place for beginner sushi eater but I would probably not be back for awhile."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have remodeled since I have been back last and it looks way better! The ambiance is on point. I'm still of course very pleased with the food as well! All you can eat is one thing, but this place makes It fresh for you! There are also plenty of tasty items for people who don't want to eat sushi with you. Always friendly service and faster if you sit at the sushi counter! Take an uber, get a little drunk and enjoy fresh made all you can eat sushi! My boyfriend and I love this place for date night!"}
{"text":"The soup was tasteless. 4 of the sushi`s were not good; Spicy salmon, crispy onion, salmon with jalapeños, the out of controlling they just were not good. Onion was tasteless. The spicy salmon had a were taste and feel. The out of control just felt were kinda slimmy. The salmon with jalapeños tasted old. Price is not bad 13.50 person all you can eat. Liked the avocado salad but it had very little avocado. Liked the green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"Akita sushi started off as a revolving sushi bar. Infortunately that didn't work our. Good thing it didn't because the all you can eat sushi is awesome!!! They have all sushi for all people and they also have great udon, rice, soup, and desert. The roasted banana for desert was quite delicious! The eel cucumber roll is full of taste. I will be back as usual. Delicious food."}
{"text":"This place blows every other all you can eat sushi place out of the water. I was really impressed with the restaurant's decor, ambiance, and food selection. Oh hi Mark. Pretty much everything you could want on the menu was there, tons of variety. I highly recommend the Akita roll. The service was also super fast and friendly. My only complaint is that the agedashi tofu had too much batter caked on before frying. Then again, this place offers incredible value for the price so it still gets 5 stars. I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"The go-to spot for poor students. There are no other sushi restaurants near that can compete with the pricing of this all you can eat sushi restaurant. The quality of the food is pretty good too. There is a large variety of nigiri, rolls, ramen, udon, appetizers, sashimi(only during dinner), desserts, etc. to choose from so you will definitely leave full AF. My friends and I come here whenever we crave sushi because it is so worth it."}
{"text":"Word to the wise: don't come here if you (a) lacking in self control and/or (b) have things to do later. If you're looking for a lot of sushi, nigiri, tempura, teriyaki, etc. for an incredibly reasonable price (that yung $14 lunch special), look no further. I almost didn't want to write this review so I could keep this sushi mecca somewhat underground, but I gotta give the people what they want. You're welcome, people. Cancel your plans, slip into your sweats with the stretchy waistband, and buckle in for the ride.   If you're a sushi snob perhaps you may look down on the sushi quality, but I think for your average Joe-san it's more than satisfactory -- it's some of the best sushi I've had in this price range and all you can eat. They have a wide variety of common rolls (you can also get them as hand rolls, which are kind of like one large piece of sushi in the form of a seaweed basket); I'm personally a fan of the spicy tuna and the eel and avocado, but I would stay away from the crab. Specialty rolls are also great, and their Crazy Volcano Roll is just the right amount of fried -- I think the Las Vegas Roll is fried a little too heavily.  Make sure you visit the bathroom (just do it -- top tier bathroom, and trust me I know bathrooms) and get the green tea ice cream!"}
{"text":"Third time going and I love this place.  I don't get all the bad reviews, you aren't spending $100, get over it.  I like variety and hate the anxiety of ordering $10-15 sushi per roll at other restaurants.  Oh sure, they may have the most divine fish but in the end, if I want more I'd have to pay for it.  Here I can try different things all for one price and not worry about a $100 bill later.  Anxiety free eating is what a \"buffet\" is meant for.  If I want the best quality and burn a hole in my wallet, I'd go Yasu Sushi Bistro but here is good comfort every day food with excellent service.   If you haven't, try the specialty rolls.  I did love the sweet heart roll and I'm not the kind of person who likes over doneup sushi."}
{"text":"Amazing deal during lunch special! Only $13.50 for all you can eat, you'd be spending that on a single roll anywhere else! It's actually legitimate sushi too, very good quality. We tried a little bit of everything - their tempura is perfectly fried (the fried bananas are sooo good!) however their fried rice was disgusting (overly sauced) and their avocado salad looked nothing like the picture (literally just iceberg lettuce, avocado slices, and too much dressing). Kid prices available which is even better. Bring your appetite!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place ever! Hidden gem!!! Such great price. And staff super friendly"}
{"text":"Awful service, was waiting for a table for four for around 15 minutes, no one even greeted us when we came in or asked us if we wanted a table. After I decided to ask the hostess she pointed us to a table of four that had been available the whole time we were there. We sat down and no one came in the first couple of minutes so we just decided to leave. Terrible."}
{"text":"Worst sushi ever warm room temperature fish Yikes!!  Went in for the all you can eat lunch 12.99 a reasonable price for an all you can eat. poor quality sushi rolls the fried rice was room temp mushy udon noodles. There were more sushi chefs and wait staff then there were customers. Will not go back  The only reason I gave it two stars I thought  the service was good .."}
{"text":"BY FAR, MY FAVORITE AYCE SUSHI PLACE!!!! So lunch price is around $13 and dinner is around $23 and it's all you can eat!! It has the best price for it!! Dinner comes with sashimi, lunch doesn't. Anyway, this place has a variety of food for AYCE! It has fried rice (REALLY GOOD FRIED RICE BTW!!!!!), udon, soba, fried udon/soba, fried bananas, ice cream, and I can go on......The service here is really good everytime I've gone and I just think it's such a good price for ayce (especially lunch!!!). My favorite roll here is the Manhatten roll and my overall favorite food here is the beef fried rice. For some reason, the fried rice here is just really good, very flavorful...and I usually end off my meal with fried bananas (in honey or chocolate...OR YOU CAN HAVE BOTH!!) and vanilla ice cream. This is definitely my go to spot for sushi! Would come here on the daily if I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Amazing FRESH Sushi, friendly excellent staff and service! The price can't be beat... $20 all you can eat for dinner! Many appetizers to choose from sushi, sashimi, hand rolls, special rolls. Don't forget about there items from the wok and ramen, udon and teriyaki... Avoid there website it's old and out of date!! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Dined here a second time within a week and downgrading my rating to 3 stars.  Came during weekend on-peak dinner hour.  Service was still prompt so that was good.  Food was just okay though.  Ordered another salmon entree, this time the salmon & vegetable teriyaki.  Salmon was again very thinly sliced as last time and bordering dry.  I did not like that my bed of vegetable teriyaki was completely drenched in a sea of sauce - makes for a very salty and wet meal.  Nothing else on the menu that I'd like to order on a subsequent visit.  Guess that concludes our brief acquaintance.  =====  First time dining here and we got our sushi craving satisfied.  Actually happened on this restaurant by chance as we originally intended to try out Hai Sushi but couldn't find it (closed?!).  We opted for a la carte instead of AYCE.  We ordered the salmon and beef bento boxes (summer).  For $10.99/bento box, it comes with the standard salad and miso soup.  Service was very fast but we came during dinner off hours so that may not be saying much.  We were quite happy with our food but we are definitely not sushi connoisseurs.  My salmon was a tad dry but that tends to be a common observance with sushi restaurants.  I liked how I was able to substitute my salmon rolls for California rolls in my bento box, nice courteous touch.  Overall, we're happy to have discovered a new Japanese restaurant in our neighbourhood.  Next time, we'll return to sample the AYCE menu."}
{"text":"Unlike most of the reviewers here, I liked this place. I've had no problem at all with the service and I find the food to be several notches above Mandarin in terms of quality, primarily because they cook it and bring it to you immediately.   Favourite dishes: Tonkatsu [best around], tempura shrimp [still hot!], spicy salmon belly.  They've changed their name; can't remember what it's called now, but it's the same ownership, just not a franchise any more, I believe."}
{"text":"If you go for weekday lunch you have to get $13 all you can eat sushi, no other options.   Service was extremely poor especially considering we were one of three tables there. Slow and we had to hunt down our server several times.   Pass on the tempura appetizer options; less than blah. Sushi is actually pretty good for an all you can eat place. Definitely go hungry and with people who can pull their weight eating their portions! You will be charged the normal price per plate if you don't finish majority of it and waste (which makes sense)."}
{"text":"Great place right at the intersection plaza. Fast service, food was decent to good. Servers were okay, and washrooms need a little help. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"I've been to many AYCE sushi restaurants and Akita is hands down one of the best. We went early and the service was impeccable. We were greeted and brought drinks fast and once we ordered our first round of food we got it quickly.   The quality is good for the price, better than most places. There is more fish than rice on the sushi rolls and nigiri, and they even offer sashimi on the AYCE dinner menu! The salmon and tuna sashimi was great, fresh and large pieces. Others in our party ordered the fried rice and chicken teriyaki. The chicken was flat (more of a cutlet or pounded out) and could have used more sauce but the taste was still good. They offer so many options on the AYCE dinner menu that there is easily something for everyone. Highly recommend and we will be back!"}
{"text":"It's very hard for me to rate Akita for a few reasons. But I give this place a 2 star because for my first experience I give them a 1 star and for my second experience I give them a 3 star...  I came here for ayce lunch and had a horrible experience. Their service was slow, they were only offering sushi not sashimi on their menu so when I ordered the sushi, there was way too much rice and very thin layer of fish. I guess it's because they want to fill you up with rice lol. Also, the fish wasn't fresh at all. Their meat was a little too oily....My boyfriend and I couldn't even eat more than half a spoon full. Their udon noodle soup was good though.   Another time, I came here for ayce dinner another time when they were offering sashimi and I had a better time. Their service was surprisingly better and their sashimi wasn't too bad. It was a bit fresher than the fish I had from the ayce lunch. Didn't bother ordering the meat because I just assumed it would be just as oily as before. But anyway, I actually left satisfied.   The prices are the typical ayce sushi price. Whenever I come here, I'm never sure what to expect of how it's gonna go. I guess you can say it's a hit or miss. At the same time, this is Bradford... we don't have much ayce sushi options so I guess sometimes you gotta settle."}
{"text":"I LOVE AKITA!   I cannot belive I haven't written a review before. Whenever I'm in AZ, I just have to make a stop here. Sashimi is included in the dinner all-you-can-eat so, of course, I'm happy. My boyfriend loves the specialty rolls. My favorite roll is the mango-tuna, it's just amazing.   The staff is super friendly and it's never too busy. While they do tell you that you need to eat what you order, they aren't overly stringent with the rule and we've never had an issue when giving back something small we didn't love or not eating all our rice. I just have nothing bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"This place is a joke, the good reviews are fake. This place advertises as a revolving Sushi, it is not. When we arrived the place was empty, dust on tables empty...menu had no prices, we were seated and then 10 minutes later asked if we had ...More"}
{"text":"My wife and I come here regularly and are always happy when we leave. That said this time was horrible service and horrible sushi. We ordered 6 rolls and only ate half because of how dry the sushi was. We waited about 15min just to get our check which we had to ask a different waiter to give us. When we got the check our waiter said he has to charge us an extra $30 for the left over sushi. We explained to him that we didn't eat it because it didn't taste fresh and was too dry. His response was, \"I have to charge you something extra at lease $5 because you didn't finish the sushi. And if you didn't like it then you should have told me something.\" I don't understand how we can tell him if we don't like something when he isn't around. He also has the manager/owner come by and say the same thing. Apparently at this place if you don't like your food you get charged extra."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I absolutely love Japanese food and usually spend on average $40-50 each on sushi. So when we found out that there is an all you can eat japanese restaurant in North Scottsdale that would only cost us about $21 each, we drove all the way from Central Phoenix.    In addition, a coworker of mine had mentioned that this place is decent for all you can eat sushi. Being that this place is an all you can eat restaurant, my expectations were not high at all.   With that being said, I was still very ecstatic to try their food, especially because they had a little bit of everything. In addition to the variety of sushi, they had appetizers (gyoza, tempura, etc), salads, teriyaki and fried rice and udon/soba/ramen. I started off with the seaweed salad. I love seaweed salad and can seriously eat it everyday. However, I couldn't take more than a few bites of their seaweed salad. It was sitting in a puddle of green liquid and it pretty much just turned me off. I had the gyoza which was nothing special, and tiny shrimp tempura which came with a dipping sauce that was tasteless. My boyfriend had the ramen/soba, and he thought it tasted like water with salt in it, undercooked noodles and broccoli (broccoli in soba?!?). Sushi was nothing great, but definitely better than all the other items we tried on the menu. I had one of the rolls with the salmon and mango in it, and it was okay. If I was rating just the sushi, I'd probably give Akita 3 stars. Service was sub par. You definitely get what you pay for in this restaurant."}
{"text":"I walked into the place and thought my food will be ready in no time.Well I thought totally wrong because it took them 1 hour to just get my seaweed salad.So I'm warning you now that if you come don't come with hungry because by the time it comes you will starve to death!!"}
{"text":"The novelty of a cheap all you can eat place has officially worn off. The 2 stars is for the price.. And maybe the selection of food. The food tastes good and the sushi is alright. If you're looking for good quality nigiri, this isn't the place. The sashimi makes the dinner price worth it though.   The service is absolutely atrocious. I'm writing this while sitting at our table that is completely covered in the plates we've had from the start. I don't think they train anybody in being a server or bussing tables. If they are trained.. They're trained by other people who are clueless. I've been here once when our server had more smoke breaks than he had visits to our table. This place used to amaze me, but I think it's cause it was dirt cheap to eat here. The novelty has completely faded."}
{"text":"What a joke. All you can eat? You get charged for rolls you don't eat. AND I've never been more disrespected in my life. Service is awful. I'd sooner die than eat here again. The rainbow roll is awful"}
{"text":"Wonderful buffet spread. Love the price, just have to take your time, order enough to eat otherwise you'll be charged for wastage. But I like it.  Food is fresh and the sushi to done nicely. Does not feel like a buffet because you still order off a menu and you get served.  Recommended: Eggplant Teriyaki, Sushi Nigiri, Fried Seafood Udon, Beef & Salmon Teriyaki, Edamame,Aged Tofu, Seaweed Salad.  A must have....sweet chilli sauce.  ok, I would never review this for a restaurant, but if you are ever at Akita Sushi, you got to visit the restroom...it's like no other restroom I've seen in any restaurant."}
{"text":"What's up with the smell in your parking lot?  Brown liquid coming out of a manhole cover?  Smells like raw sewage?? People walking on it and cars walking through it???"}
{"text":"It was a miss today. Appetizers were good. Got the fried scallops, squid and shrimp but the sushi tasted funny. The rice tasted stale as if it was frozen and thawed the next day. A friend who owned a sushi restaurant said freezing sushi rice and using it the next day actually happens as normal practice. This place has gone down in quality and I'm saddened by it.   Service was good though."}
{"text":"Just came across this neighborhood gem and finally made it back. It is definitely a good find! You really can't go wrong when you walk in and find more Asians rolling the sushi than the actual patrons! Staff is attentive and friendly without being imposing as you consume an entire continent of sushi to your stomach's content. The quality is far better than I expected for a revolving sushi joint; my fave is the sweetheart roll. I will have to make a trip back with my entourage to see how the rest of the menu fares from the conveyor selection. I'm excited it is in my backyard! Give it a try and tell me your thoughts :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Such a great deal everything on the menu is all you can eat, made to order. If you go during lunch it's $13/person or for dinner $21/person! Such a steal! Everything is good quality and really tasty. The only bad thing is that it gets really busy in there and the service can be slow, but at that price it's worth the wait. And that the lunch menu is much smaller than the dinner menu, so if you want more variety I suggest going for the dinner menu."}
{"text":"This is the best deal you're gonna find at an all you care to eat sushi place! At only $12 per person for lunch, you definitely get your money's worth. They have such a huge selection of sushi, as well as appetizers like calamari, dumplings, and fried vegetables. There all also some non sushi options like fried rice, teriyaki chicken, noodles, and more.  The entire place seems very clean and well kept, and the staff is very friendly and polite. I think the food comes pretty quickly as well, which is impressive since it's made to order! The quality of the sushi itself is spectacular. I love the volcano roll. A few hands of salmon skin rolls is also one of my new favorites, definitely worth a try if that's up your alley. To finish off the meal, I always highly recommend a serving or two of the green tea ice cream - yum!  Definitely come with an empty stomach, there are so many tasty sounding options and I always get too full before I can try everything. Overall, best ayce sushi you can find!!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi! 13.50 for all you can eat! You can order anything and they make it fresh! Also includes miso soup and salads!! Soooo good!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with 12.99 all you can eat sushi, apps and desserts. Super quick service, they were on it with refills. Really nice people. Go."}
{"text":"Very. Average... You get an iPad and with all these options great ! The picture doesn't even look like we got but anyways ...  There \" general tao \" and \" honey chicken \" same chicke and sauce except the general had chilli flakes in it   There scallops were old and hard :(  The udon was covered in black pepper badly barely edible !   The food was okay. The sushi was okay.   It was 15.99 and it was OKAH    The atmosphere was nice , the manager who greeted us was wearing a suit which was nice :)   They didn't come around with water refills which always makes me mad but they give u bigger glasses ! And alcohol good price."}
{"text":"You will probably be fine as long as you can manage to stay away from the ice water, the edamame, and the fish."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential if only they would train their staff much more adequately. Our waitress missed the miso soup that we had ordered along with a tuna and yellow tail nigiri.  We had to put it on a new sheet of paper so we can get that ordered. I seen two little bugs flying around. I managed to kill one and not the other. Pretty gross. I hope the kitchen isn't like this too. I understand bugs happen but not two at ONCE !  Although, props to the waitress for filling our waters up. A lot of their sushi roll is filled with rice and not even fish. I feel like I have been jipped out for what I am paying. I will stick to the best sushi place I been going to now for 4 years and that's iron chef off Tatum and Shea. Great prices. Friendly staff. Quality food."}
{"text":"Delicious food and sushi! Great if you're wanting to try some different things at a good, flat-rate price. Don't waste, though!"}
{"text":"AYCE sushi.  I used to love these places but have realized there is much better sushi out there.  I also find I over eat at these places and feel lazy and tired afterwards.  This was pretty much my first AYCE sushi I went to and have been to this establishment multiple times.  Of all the AYCE sushi places I've been to I do find this place to be my favorite and my family feels the same.    The restaurant is run by Chinese and most of the waitresses are also Chinese.  Dealsies if you can speak Cantonese with them!  The service here is good for the most part but I think they need a new organizational system as almost immediately after I order, another waitress is at my table asking me for my order.  Another thing that prevents me from giving this place a higher rating is that they sometimes forget my order or part of my order and after a large order, the staff seems to slow down with the attention they give you.  This is generally not an issue with 2-3 people but becomes especially annoying when you come with a larger group.    Location:  Bradford........ Akita is close to the Wal-Mart.  Not a bad location I guess.  The food:  They are quick.  The rice is always cooked well and the amount to fish you get is usually a fair amount.  I say usually because again, after a large order, if you order another piece of say, teriyaki salmon, I've found my next piece is generally a bit thinner.  Fish is fresh.  As far as tuna goes, they only have white tuna.  Their soba is filled with noodles (too much) and it tastes like the same broth for every type of bowl you get.  Yummy though.  As for me, I usually get the cold rolls or sushi:  California, B.C., avocado, salmon and then salmon sushi or sashimi if I'm there for dinner.  And then spicy seafood soba.  I've eaten other stuff that family or friends usually get and the taste is delicious with almost anything I've eaten there except the tempura.  Something about it I just don't like.  4 flavours of ice cream:  red bean, green tea, mango and vanilla.  Pricing:  Don't know the exact prices but I was there for lunch today and for 2 people without any alcohol it was about $35.  Anyway, will I come there again?  Of course but just not often.  Like I said, there are far better places but as far as AYCE, this place is great."}
{"text":"The one thing that stood out at this all you can eat sushi restaurant was all the non-sushi option that were includes in the all you can eat menu.  Gyoza, beef, tempura, ice cream, ect.  The sushi was just okay.  I had one good roll and the rest were fair.  I did eat off their lunch menu. Maybe the dinner menu is better, but I will probably never know."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there and this place is legit, I know good sushi from average or touristy pretty well, and these guys worked pretty hard at creating dishes with nice size portions, they didn't skimp on the fish at all, great presentation and everything literally tasted great.  I read the reviews about cleanliess, poor service and average food, and I didn't experience any of that.  I was promptly seated, waited on immediately, and repeatedly asked if I wanted more food.    Once they get busy the wait times to get your dishes will get longer, but that is understandable.  They have a conveyer belt, which was not on, everything was made to order from the menu for $20, and 100% of the items on the menu are included.  There aren't any extras except for drinks.    I will definitely go back there, and I would also bring my kids as it seems like a very family friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi places but not so much for the sushi LOL!  I mean I order the salmon sashimi and one or two rolls. My fav is the rock n roll roll. It's deep fried... Yum!  The baby mushroom beef roll and coconut shrimp are also a fav.  The food comes really fast and the servers actually know whats in each roll so that's super helpful.  For dessert their deep friend milk is a must try!  But again, I do Persian lay come for most of their side dishes so if you're in it for fresh sashimi or amazing rolls, this probably Ly isn't the perfect place for you, though it remains my favourite (:"}
{"text":"The reason for the 3/5 star rating was the manager told us they messed up on our reservation. They decided to put a booth with a table for our party. Not a good setup to celebrate a friends 21st birthday. The waiter was serious and not friendly at all. I was serving my friends like I worked at the restaurant. We didn't get to order until 30-45 mins after we were setup.   Sushi was quite delicious and for an AYCE for about $21! Great price and food! The interior design of the restaurant looked awesome and bathrooms was very unique with how the flows to your hand. I will give this restaurant another shot b/c it's definitely worth it. I would like to update my review on my next visit!"}
{"text":"They give zero fucks at this place. They treat their customers like garbage and the food is either super greasy or it just doesn't show up.  We had a special diet in our group so we ordered something specific for her THREE TIMES and it never actually made it to the table. We asked for water 4 times before it actually came.  We also reserved a table for 10 and we were offered 2 booths back to back instead and were still charged the extra gratuity!  None of us will be going back to Akita Sushi again."}
{"text":"Nah, I've had better.  Came here for lunch and the \"revolving\" was not revolving. Instead, we were given a menu of what's available, from appetizers to sushi to udon, ramen, fried rice, dessert.  It was still all \"you can eat\" for $11.95.  We ordered from the appetizers, lots of fried, breaded items, it was great for the kids who were with us.  We got sushi, it was nice and fresh.  We got udon to share and it was okay, not enough noodles.   Green tea ice cream was the best part!  Fried bananas were over breaded.  Service was slow, they had one souz chef making sushi, appetizers took a long time and server forgot our orders, she barely spoke English.  May not come back, maybe for the green tea ice cream only..."}
{"text":"We wondered about this place every time we drove by and finally decided to check it out tonight.  The staff was friendly and the service was good but... The sushi was warm and all the plates on the conveyor belt have been rotating even before we got there and most of them were still there until we left (we stayed over an hour). AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.  They never even bothered to replace the older plates no matter how long they've been sitting there rotating at room temperature.  Seaweed salad was been on there for so long,  it was seeping moisture,  looked more like seaweed soup than salad. I was craving yellowtail sashimi but didn't feel like taking the only plate that's been rotating there for who knows how long,  so I ordered fresh plate and the fish came out half frozen.  Plates on rotation are warm and the ones you order come out frozen..  Also it was a bit pricey for the quality and considering it's a revolving sushi bar rather than a traditional sushi restaurant.  (90 bucks Not including gratuity for not so fresh sushi,  I wasn't very happy about that).  I really hate leaving negative reviews but one thing that makes me mad the most is spending decent amount of money for bad quality food.  If I'm gonna spend hundred bucks at a restaurant,  i want to feel satisfied after dining and it wasn't the case this time. I'm very disappointed at this place  since I've been looking forward to check this place out for several weeks. I guess i can stop wondering now. I just hope I don't get sick from eating warm raw seafood. I give 2 stars for friendly service. After i came home,  I immediately came online to see what other people had to say and saw that the restaurant had several health violations. Honesty I'm not shocked... I'm sorry to have to leave negative feedback but this is how I felt after tonight.  I don't think we will be going back unless there's a significant improvement.  Good luck Akita revolving sushi. Seriously..."}
{"text":"Again a month later, Fantastic as always at lunch for $12.00! Fish fresh spicy tuna rolls awesome! Of course they charge if order and leave it that's wasteful and keeps product costs in line! If you ever ran a kitchen labor and raw product is biggest cost. I guess some people don't get this! Service is great at lunch come at off time service is always fast!"}
{"text":"Ok short and sweet, I found the sushi restaurant by accident. All you can eat format is usually not my cup of tea, but this place is awesome. Everything was great , super fresh, big portions, and no limit. 3 hungry guys feasted for $75 including tip and beers...BANSEI !!!! Ps Bathrooms were even cool, cave like with fountain sinks!!"}
{"text":"All you can eat lunch is the bomb. Enjoy fine service and easy like your at a crowded buffet. Good quality sushi and the entire menu is available for your enjoyment.  Please don't over order as any waste can be charged to your bill. The out of controll roll was amazing and the rainbow roll is my go to."}
{"text":"I've gone here for lunch twice and have left satisfied both times. Both the sushi and sashimi are fresh, taste great, and also look good. Apart from the regular rolls found on your average sushi menu they even have specialty rolls such as the volcano and Las Vegas rolls on their lunch menu! Their desserts and appetizers are also good. Apart from the four categories above, I would avoid any other menu items as they are sub par."}
{"text":"The food was awful, the service might be worse. They didn't even bring me half of what I ordered, definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"I love conveyor sushi joints, and while this one appears clean and has a friendly staff, there's simply no excuse for serving what should be cold dishes at or above room temperature.  Each plate I tried was as warm or warmer than the previous one, leading me to cut the visit shorter than it would have been out of fear of getting sick.  On top of that, the check topped $50; that money would have gone further and with better quality at Ra or even Teharu.  I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1 star I would. I left 6 pieces of plain white rice and the Manager came over telling me if I didn't eat all the rice on my plate he was going to charge me extra. I will never come back and I will tell everyone I know how horrible this place treats customers!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi. Well worth the cost. Some rolls had too much rice. Fish was served right at room temperature- very nice. Sauces were a bit heavy, masking sushi flavor. Specciality rolls were ample in variety. Definitely not small pieces, rolls 6-8pcs. Ice cream tasted sites made and we're flavorful. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Akita is my go to all-you-can-eat sushi place. It feels as though the quality of the sushi has decreased a bit over time but I feel that tends to be the case for most buffet style sushi. For 25 dollars, I'm happy with stuffing my face with okay sushi!  The made to order menu items may be better"}
{"text":"This place is growing on me. They had a good selection of special rolls.  Quality for all you can eat was very good and everything is made to order. Rainbow roll was very good. Seaweed salad was fresh. They were busy and it took a long time for sushi (30 minutes) so next time I'm going earlier or later rather than right at lunch. But overall great value and I hope this place keeps up the quality of the food ! Also nice dessert included - green tea ice cream and fried bananas - delicious."}
{"text":"So, if you are hungry for Sushi and want great variety for a fair price, this is your place.  Make no mistake, this is good and fresh sushi plated with care and some flair.  This is NOT a place to go pay $4 a piece because they decorate the plate with flowers and other \"stuff\".  I am a big guy with a big appetite. I eat here 3-4 times a month and get my fill of good sushi, rice, and other Asian fair.    Warning:  If you are a \"Sushi Snob\" this is not the pace for you and we do not want you here!"}
{"text":"No smile. No hi how are you. No how can I help you. No sashimi on the munch menu, no items from the grill on the lunch menu. And the food is very mediocre. Not recommended however it's the only sushi place in Bradford I think, too bad because if any other place opened up would be better than here"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried this place yesterday based on the \"all you can eat sushi\" banner and the fairly positive reviews on yelp. We got there around 3 and the staff immediately sat us and walked us through the process. The conveyor belt wasn't on, but that wasn't too surprising given the time of day. The menu is all you can eat from appetizer to dessert and the waitress said try anything you want just don't waste food. We did not think anything of this at first but then we noticed that the top left corner of the second page tells you that if you do not eat all of the food you will be charged accordingly. The food was great, everything was freshly cooked for us. We were able to try several rolls, appetizers, and desserts, and we enjoyed everything we tried. Our bill came out to $30 after taxes including two drinks. Can't beat it. My personal suggestion is to try the miso soup, gyoza, spicy salmon roll, volcano roll, and the deep fried bananas with green tea ice cream (it tasted like Fruity Pebbles!). Overall, a great experience, definitely the first of many for us."}
{"text":"I'm really impressed with this place and can't understand the complaints. This is my \"go-to\" comfort food place. I LOVE their shrimp  tempura  udon soup. It is a lot of food for only $9.95! Tonight we ordered their soup, California rolls & spicy tuna rolls. Our total was $23. The sushi was very good and the soup was an A+! The staff is friendly and we always feel great ordering from here. Keep it up!   *We only used to go to Hiro, but we now go here! Great food that is affordable!"}
{"text":"Wide variety, very reasonably priced.  We didn't realize it until we were leaving but you can also order entrees from the menu as well.  That is helpful for the crowd, including my wife, that don't like sushi.  A novel way (the revolving conveyor belt) to offer up the different varieties of sushi."}
{"text":"Updating from my last review.  Which was 4/5.    *THIS IS AN ALL YOU CAN EAT PLACE; SO IF YOU DON'T EAT IT YOU PAY FOR LEFTOVERS*  - sorry you'd be surprised how many people don't get this concept.    Pros: *Good Quality Sushi *Customizable  *Huge selection *All you can eat - not buffet style though *Decently Priced *Drink Specials *Good Atmosphere  Cons: *Every blue moon you have someone just learning english (just bare with them - it isn't an easy language to learn).   *Listening to _____  people not understanding the concept of all you can eat which means you pay full price for leftovers.  Then complaining about it yet, it says it right on the menu.  Seriously, who doesn't know you can't take leftovers at all you can eat places.  *Hot Green Tea isn't that good - which I am happy to deal with due to all the positives. However, I'd be happy to pay more for some quality green tea.    I feel like I am a regular there.  I love it.  The quality is good ( I only have had rolls, sushi and nigiri).  They don't over pack it with rice.  You can customize your rolls.  They have great drink specials.  I don't know how there isn't a wait to get into this place.  Some of the servers are learning English so bare with them they really are trying very hard!  They have a lot of options on the menu and are decently priced!   I don't know what else to say about it, besides it is a must try if you like rolls & sushi."}
{"text":"Having late dinner with the hubby. It's our first time here and so far we are impressed with their service and their sushi selection."}
{"text":"For all you can eat sushi, the variation that they gave was pretty good. It ranged from not just sushi, but also fried noodles, udon, soba in soup, dessert, so that was pretty satisfying to try out. The ratio for the nigiri of rice to fish was pretty sad. It was about a 1:3 ratio fish to rice. The other all you can eat sushi's I've had, the quality wasn't too bad but this one was mediocre. It fulfilled my slight sushi craving, but also disappointed me at the same time. Price is really cheap for lunch though, just $15 if you want to fulfill that quick sushi craving. for a good price."}
{"text":"Really like this place.  It's solid.  Not necessarily spectacular or most amazing ever but it's solid and better than your average neighborhood sushi place. It's a great place for reasonably priced sushi and Japanese food.  My personal favorite is the teriyaki eggplant.    The all you care to eat arrangement is a nice treat for sushi because you don't have the price of every roll in the back of your mind as you're dining.  For the price of a couple rolls elsewhere you receive a full meal here.   I recommend it for a casual/quick (by sushi standards) evening out."}
{"text":"If you have a big appetite, $19.99 for all you can eat is a greal deal ($11.99 for lunch). Make sure you finish your plates or you will be charged for uneaten food, which is awesome, given then amount of food Americans waste. We tried a number of plates that were all small enough to be a sample and it was \"buy one get one free\" night for beer! The food was fresh and the service was great, other than the language barrier with our server. But hey, that's how you know it's a true sushi joint, right?"}
{"text":"This place is uber confusing.  Walked in and everyone just looked up, there is no hostess, the waitstaff also double as hostesses, and cashiers, so we had to wait for them to put food down before coming to take us to a table.  They also have a conveyor belt, so I'm sure at one time it worked, but no longer.  GREAT price.  All you can eat - $20 for dinner.   Food is decently fresh, portions are mini, but that's a great way to eat lots of different items.  There are a lot of different items on the AYCE menu too - surprisingly nice.   I was expecting a pared down AYCE menu, but this was not the case at all.  They have all kinds of apps - spring rolls, soup, seaweed salad, gyoza.  All different types of rolls, even special rolls. Ramen, udon, fried rice, terrayaki too.   Limited beer and wine menu.  Flat screen tvs above were all on ESPN.  Eat all the food you order because 1. it's wasteful otherwise 2. you get charged the full price for each item you don't finish."}
{"text":"Went here with my guy for lunch. The place is nice on the inside. The servers seemed friendly enough. The selection on the menu was pretty good too. My real annoyance was that they took our order separately and then didn't bother to bring my food. It was our first AYCE order and we were the only table in the place so it's not like they could get confused or anything. Maybe I complained loud enough because everything else I ordered actually arrived. I didn't care much for the food. The tamago hand roll had cucumber which I've never seen before. The yam tempura roll was swimming in mayo which also seemed a bit odd. The spicy salmon roll was ok but didn't have avocado or cucumber, just salmon, spicy mayo, and tempura bits. The rolls were small and the nigiri had some of the smallest slices of fish I have ever seen. The inari and tamago were both pretty gross which is odd because they are my favorites and I've eaten then at well over two dozen places and never not liked them. On the upside, the soft drinks are included for free and the \"butterfly cheese\" (obscure name for cheese wontons I guess) is delicious. I don't think I'd go back unless begged by friends."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant at first because I have had some bad experiences at all you can eat sushi joints but this one totally took me by surprise. The have great sushi and don't mind that stay as long ass you can continue stuffing food in your mouth. They have great service and move pretty quick. Its kinda tucked away off 90th and Pima in Scottsdale and well worth the drive for me."}
{"text":"It's a fun idea for a restaurant and the pricing is amazing!!! However, I have been going to Sakana Sushi in Scottsdale for sometime and I wish Akita had more of the elaborate specialty rolls that Sakana does. I found this sushi average and was definitely surprised at the low cost. I would pay more if they offered specialty rolls. I enjoyed the neon green lighting."}
{"text":"Food was GREAT. Service was horrible. It was our first time here and we tried to explain that to the waitress who barely spoke English ( and did not try at all ). I wanted more explaining on the little order forms that we filled out and she just kept saying \"all you can eat!\". We filled out the forms and apparently she just turned one in because my friend kept getting his food plate after plate and I was just sitting there with nothing. I finally asked if I could reorder after realizing nothing was coming and she seemed surprised and almost annoyed. Still only got half of the things I ordered. The food that I finally did receive was great but not worth all of the trouble. I wanted to explain my frustrations to her but she could not understand me."}
{"text":"WORST SUSHI EVER. I'm a sushi freak and I've been to plenty of sushi restaurants and this is by far the WORST. the quality is so poor and the waiter had no idea what anything on the menu was, it was just an overall awful experience. I wouldn't return and eat there even if it was free"}
{"text":"Super yummy! Sometimes all you can eat is gross sushi but it's all made fresh and you can get noodles, tempura, fresh sushi rolls, nigiri, dessert etc for a very good price!"}
{"text":"The sushi is good and price is great. All you can eat for 12.50 is fantastic and you receive your food quickly. That being said, the second time we visited we were starting to eat when 2 cockroaches started crawling towards our plate. The owner comped our meal after it being brought to his attention and apologized stating he has a pest guy he uses frequently and this is not something he has happen. We ordered beer like we were going to prior to the incident when he comes over and says he can't pay for those just the food. Fine. Then we did not see our server the rest of our visit. Good service the rest of the business... Not so great."}
{"text":"It gets two stars because of cheap price. But that is it. Waiting staff bring in wrong food sometimes. They gave me a check before I was ready to leave. This used to be my go to place until they handed me the check (I took that is you ate too much now get the ____ out). They have proportion distortion only putting a thin layer of fish on their sushi. I wont be back."}
{"text":"Akita has tons of accidentally vegan options and they're very affordable, so I love coming here. You can definitely tell that it's cheaper for a reason, but I still really enjoy their food. I love getting avocado rolls, sweet potato rolls, and seaweed salad. They have an amazing all you can eat lunch special that's only about $13! I couldn't believe it either. Typically though, I don't eat enough for all you can eat to be worth it but if you have a big appetite you should keep this in mind."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service here is really awful!!! We walked in and stood there for a while. There were the sushi chefs standing behind the sushi bar just staring at us, not doing anything and they still didn't bother to let staff know that they should probably come over to seat us. We had to walk over to them and ask if they were going to seat us or not.  When we got seated, our waitress spoke horrible broken English and we had a hard time understanding each other. Not to mention she had the voice level of a mouse. We kept asking her to speak up and no matter how hard she \"tried\" it was next to impossible to hear her. She also didn't come around during our entire meal to refill any of our drinks.   Besides the service, the food was pretty good. Sushi rolls were flavorful, udon soup was just Ok, tempura was super oily, sashimi was good. Menus are hard to read as they're all scratched up and the pictures and words are almost no longer visible. We had to ask for different menus which, honestly, weren't that much better.   Oh, the bathrooms look like caves and have a marble type waterfall as the sink faucets...#EXTRA."}
{"text":"It was good food, but I wish they explained how the menu works.  When I went it was my first time there and I was super confused.  I didn't know it was a buffet.  And I didn't know how to order or anything.  I did like the food though. And they were nice about me and my confusion.  I didn't get aditude for not knowing the process.   I would recommend trying this place if you are a big sushi person."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what's up with the previous ratings giving 4 or 5 stars. I got the Chicken Ramen and it did not look anything close to the pictures they had shown on their menu. There were no boiled egg, the chicken were cut into little squares rather than strips. The chicken were no where near fresh. They felt like frozen chicken that were microwaved. The sushi were well below mediocre. Not coming back here agin. 2 stars because their customer service was alright."}
{"text":"I love this place! The all you can eat food system is amazing and the food is to die for. I would totally come back and I suggest this place to everyone I talk to"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time today. They did a nice job on the inside with the sushi conveyor belt, sushi bar, etc. The entrance looks tired and dilapidated - we almost turned way before we walked in. A tired door, a curtain over the glass (on the inside), a weatherbeaten and abandoned menu box outside all contributed to a look of a neglected restaurant.  The service and friendliness of the staff was top notch. We were warmly greeted when we arrived and got a nice thank you on the way out. They kept our area clear, our tea and water full, etc. Actually, this was some of the best service I've seen a while in a restaurant of this price range or even a bit higher.  Now, to the main course - the sushi. It was average - not great, not bad. And for sushi, not bad is a good thing. I like this much more than Sakana's too large of portions and too low quality seafood. There's a reasonable selection of items on the conveyor and a lot more to be had in the conventional menu. None of the conveyor items were particularly noteworthy and none had the \"wow\" factor of terrific seafood or a terrific roll recipe. But none was bad either.  I think I'll be back - quick, friendly, reasonable prices, reasonable food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Great owners, great staff, great food. This is our go-to place for sushi in the valley. We get a bunch of us guys together and hit up Akita.   Recommendations: Vegas Roll and Volcano Roll...AMAZING!  Don't forget the ice cream! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"20$ all you can eat! Everyone I bring here loves this place. It's great value & a fantastic price. The service is great as well- they're super accommodating to kids too."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch. I guess for lunch they don't have enough of a crowd for the revolving to run. I can understand as they have to have a certain amount of customers for the revolving to make sense.   Instead they had all you can eat off the menu which covers a lot of ground. Sushi and other traditional items. For the price it's a good value.  Had shrimp tempura appetizers. Quite good...small shrimp but crispy and well prepared. Wife had the pork cutlet appetizer also and it was tasty.  Dived into the sushi. Surprisingly they had yellowtail on the sushi menu which is one of our favorites. Also had white tuna, masago, spicy tuna, mackerel and red clam. They are a tad heavy on the rice but standard for an all you can eat place.  Wife liked the yellow tail and we had two or three more orders. The eel avocado roll is good also.  I went back to the shrimp tempura a few more times. I liked it. Nice crispness.   Finished off with fried banana and green tea ice cream.  Overall good value and I should be back. After I lose the weight gained here...  Oh and you have to go check the restrooms out!"}
{"text":"Ever get that feeling that you're full... then not full then full again? That's certainly the feeling you get when you come here for a meal. We came here for lunch and experienced the all you can eat sushi phenomenon. We were very satisfied with the quality of sushi, but it was kinda slow. Definitely worth it. It was good and we will be back."}
{"text":"I admit that $12 for AYCE sushi, appetizers, and entrees is a great deal, but you get what you pay for... average quality food. I definitely came here with high expectations of this place only to be left disappointed. The service was just okay. When we received our appetizers, they basically tossed them all together in a little basket and handed it to us quickly. My udon soup did not taste fresh - it was lukewarm and almost as if they had just microwaved it and gave it to me. The sushi was just okay - nothing special. They definitely used more rice in their sushi so we ended up getting full after our first round.   Like I said, the lunch price is a steal, but the food didn't leave me wanting more. I think I'll just stick with my usual sushi joints."}
{"text":"So I've been going to this location and then they opened the Brampton location on Queen street, if it wasn't for proximity I would stick to this location. Better quality of food and bigger, less rice. Their price is low comparing with other AYCE sushi places.   I love their takes on \"pringles\" and spicy udon is actually spicy. Also my fav \"butterfish\" is fresh fresh fresh!   They've been having contests here but I never come by on the right dates to check my ticket lol  Not my favorite sushi joint but one of the top ones I wouldn't find myself dragging my feet to get to.  I know there has been a couple mentions here about customer service, lol I just don't come expecting. I mean as long as they bring me the food I ordered and the bill I'm happy. they do fill my tea before I ask though, not so much on the water.   And they have canned pops and not the filter stuff, my brother always walk out with a full can."}
{"text":"The best all you can eat sushi in town!!!!  Great sushi and service.  Enjoyed a wonderful dinner with our good friends who came in to town to visit!"}
{"text":"Great value and yummy sushi. When we walked in for dinner everyone was very nice and accommodating definitely worth the 19.99 for unlimited sushi! Yum"}
{"text":"Truth to be told, I am not a fan of sushi, any sushi.  Not caring for raw fish or sticky rice, I'm pretty much SOL in this department.  However, because I am a fantastic wife that allows her husband to choose a restaurant on his birthday, I've learned to live with it.  My secret is looking for shellfish and avocado and drowning the poor bastard (the sushi, not my husband) in soy sauce.  So, we arrive at Akita.  I like the name.  It reminds me of a big fluffy dog.  I like it that I can inspect the plates as they pass by on the little conveyor.  If this was a concept at a Mexican restaurant, I would weigh an easy 400 pounds.  I wished there were a menu available of what was in each roll, but no worries, if I didn't like it, birthday man would eat it.  And actually, my visual assessment of the ingredients was pretty good.  I liked everything I chose.    Although our drink order was taken promptly, I did have to ask for them when it became clear it was never going to happen.  I can only imagine it was an oversight, as the restaurant was not busy.  My only real complaint is that there were huge gaps on the belt.  I get it that since it wasn't busy, they didn't want to overload it with food that wouldn't be served in time.  But the spacing should have been better.  At times, it took a good 10 minutes for anything to pass by.  I also would have preferred fewer pieces on a plate.  Most plates had at least 4 pieces of sushi.    But overall, for a newly opened place, great job!  And for $35, we had a stack of plates.  My husband was a fan as well.  Hopefully, he'll write his own review.  But I'm not counting on it.  My work is never done."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times including today (5-3-17).  The price is competitive.  Lunch was less than $15 without tip.  The Nigiri sushi had thin slices of fish and a thick portion of rice.  Eating just the fist and leaving the rice is considered wasting food.  There is no sashimi option for lunch.  Everything else was good, in terms of quality and wide selection.  Drinks are an extra charge.  I liked the dessert selection."}
{"text":"They add way too much rice to the nigiri, a clear attempt to make customers feel full faster. We snuck rice into our napkins and flushed down the toilet it was so bad.   The tuna sashimi was strange and a different grade than the stuff they put on the rolls. It was super thick and chewy, that also got flushed down the toilet. Send those fishies back to the ocean!"}
{"text":"We are from Vegas, so very used to AYCE sushi. The best part about this place is the price, but you cannot expect quality fish.  Issues:  1. Way too much rice on the nigiri's!! More rice than fish, and rice was hard. 2. With the exception of the sashimi, all the fish came out room temperature. I expect my rice warm and fish cold. Knowing this is raw, eating it room temperature was very concerning... 3. Certain fish tasted old. Spicy tuna and salmon rolls definitely were dry and felt like they've been sitting around.  Pros: 1. There is all you can eat sashimi, which is decent quality. Very rare to find an AYCE that will offer that. 2. Decent prices... We're used to paying $26+ for dinner, so not bad. 3. Service was polite and prompt, although not enthusiastic.  Good for a sushi craving, but definitely not the best around."}
{"text":"The only reason I went there was be a use Google said this was a revolving sushi bar, woops. Turns out its an all you can eat sushi place which I found out that it's in big plastered letters right next to their storefront sign. Overall the experience was pretty good. This isn't world class , but it's a lot better than a lot of regular sushi places in the valley. For the price for dinner, I could see myself coming back every so often. My only complaint was that I was greeted by a couple of non English speakers and was confused the entire time what the place actually was until I sat down and figured it out myself. Other than that the portions were smaller than most rolls at regular spots, so feel free to try a bit of everything."}
{"text":"For an all you can eat sushi place this might be the best out there! Yep. Dinner selections are absolutely delicious with sashimi. Love all their sushis. Bang for your buck all the way thru. Their green tea ice cream is good and the service is nice. Place is very clean as well."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best sushi I've had. I've tried some of the other places in the valley and they simply don't compare. Fresh, authentic and well-balanced. The price is amazing and the fact that it's all-you-can-eat is amazing. My brother, dad and myself all agree it's by far the best sushi place in the valley. The staff is also very friendly and attentive. Will be back many many more times.  Try their Red Snapper Nigiri. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"ate here over the weekend for date night on sunday and loved it! we went around 5-530 and it hadn't gotten too busy yet, so there wasn't really a wait on our sushi. their all you can eat system was a little confusing at first, different from what i'm used to, but once the food came i was very pleased. normally you get a sheet with 3 rounds of sushi ordering on it, but here you order 8pc rolls and then everything else is ordered as 1pc. the fish tastes fresh and they were presented beautifully, especially the sweetheart roll. they were amazing with refills and were always ready for us to order our next round. also, definitely get their green tea and mango ice cream, so yummy! i'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Sushi is decent for the 13.50 price for lunch all you care to eat.  I went here with my brother and we both didn't like the way they did the Las Vegas and Voicanos here and didn't finish those.  My brother didn't finish his eel rolls because he was full.    They did not charge us extra for not finishing.  I think the extra charge for leftovers is if people order too much food that they don't finish.    The seafood udon (not soup) sucked.  My brother liked the salmon rolls saying they were fresh.  Spicy tuna rolls were decent too.  Overall a decent place and a good price.  Better quality than most sushi buffets but not high end sushi quality either."}
{"text":"Terrible flavor and horrible concept. If you can't finish what you order, they punish you by charging you per piece!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely the worst all you can eat sushi place I've ever been to. The pieces of fish on the nigiri were so tiny and thin and the rice ball was huge so you couldn't even taste the fish at all. The rolls did not taste good. Only good thing was the shrimp tempura and that you could order as much of that as you wanted. Was not worth my drive at all and definitely will never return!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I just discovered it about 2 months ago and have already been here 6-8 times. You can't beat $12.99 all you can eat sushi until 4pm. Sometimes it can be busy, but other times it's pretty dead as well. I'm not gonna say the quality is Grade A, but the price to quality ratio cannot be beat! If you are a sushi snob, this place probably isn't for you. If your a sushi noob like me, this place is a second home"}
{"text":"just opened! i got 2nd to review!  i love the revolving sushi concept...because it's cheap and it's quick. you sit at one of numerous bar type seating areas and a conveyor belt runs in front of you with smaller portions of rolls and sushi items. you simply pick out the ones you want without having to wait for table service.  they give you a full service menu as well, and it describes what each roll is (beyond the obvious ones). the sashimi selection on the revolver is limited but the prices are inexpensive so you don't have to order a whole roll to find out you don't like something.   the sushi and sashimi we did try was very good, tasted fresh, and i wasn't at all worried about a second rate sushi place. i first tried a place like this in new mexico and loved it ever since, but this is the first place i've seen it since then. i've heard it's popular in japan......and it is popular to me!  prices range from 1.50 for 2 pieces of mackeral nigiri up to 5.00 for 3 pieces of salmon or tuna sashimi. average for items is 3.00.   i love it, and will be back!"}
{"text":"This was a bad experience for sure. They have these cards that you fill out while you're there for each individual item you want to have on the menu each person fills out one and the food supposed to come to on separate plates but instead of doing that they put the teriyaki chicken and mixed it with the salmon which was only for me yet my girlfriend ordered teriyaki chicken as well and is allergic to salmon and they expect my girlfriend to eat it with salmon. They tend to mix up orders a lot. Don't ask if you have any food allergies. And seem to pretend to not speak English. The table next to use got teriyaki chicken that was still raw. I could have cook this stuff home and had a better F ing meal. That's why you go out to eat.to be amazed with the food."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! All you can eat lunch for a very affordable price. The sushi was made to order and came out quickly."}
{"text":"The service in this place is very fast and they are very friendly. I don't have any complaints about the sushi, it tasted good and fresh...I didn't get any food poisoning like I did in many other places. It does get busy around lunch time but again...you will get served very fast. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great sashimi!  Surprised on the quality considering it was all you can eat. Called about 20 sushi joints in the Phoenix area and this was the only all you can eat."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, I was excited to have a revolving sushi place so close to my work. Revolving sushi is usually inexpensive, and makes for a good lunch to break up the monotony of the work week. We didn't have a chance to check it out until this weekend, and I don't think I'll be going back.  I guess the whole revolving thing bombed for them, so they went to an all-you-can-eat menu. Good in theory, but in practice, it left much to be desired. It's $11.95 a person, and the menu has everything from various appetisers (gyozas, yakitori, edamame, etc) to soups, fried rice and udon entrees, to sushi.   I just wasn't impressed with anything, really. Our server was nice, but the food just wasn't worth it.   We got tempura shrimp, and stir-fried seafood udon to start. The tempura was ok, but nothing special, but the udon was squishy, and lacking flavour. For sushi, we got the eel and avocado roll, the spicy yellowtail and the shrimp tempura roll.   None of it was anything to write home about. I've had better. Way better. I guess for $28 the amount of food we got was ok, but when I really had to choke it down, it just wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Came here with my family last night, & was literally sick to my stomach after eating two pieces of sushi. That being said, I LOVE sushi, but this is NOT sushi!!  Do not go here, better off spending more on less quantity, rather than low quality AYCE. I have never in my life not been able to eat sushi that was served to me.  Huge disappointment, we left and then proceeded to have a second dinner after. Zero stars!"}
{"text":"There are warning signs in life.  A dog with the hair on its back standing up... A wisp of acrid smoke coming from an electrical outlet... The guy with the tinfoil hat and the hunting rifle...  The place was packed on a Friday evening, and I was able to get a deuce by the front door, complete with a sticky surface.  Warning number one.  I should have known better than to forgo the All-You-Can-Eat sushi for something off the menu, but I wanted good sushi--not a carb loading.   I saw a lot of \"white tuna\" on most selections, which should have been my second warning.  I ordered the Sushi Fall combination, and substituted the white tuna (I hear there is no such thing as white tuna) for salmon.  The meal started with a standard Miso soup and a lettuce salad with what tasted like a salmon dressing.  OK so far.  The sushi platter was a shock.  Each piece was a handful of rice with a wallpapering of fish tissue on top.  I then realized that ordering off the menu at an AYCE means they likely just make up your special order with the stuff pre-made that morning for the bargain eaters.  The total amount of fish protein must have been less than 4 ounces, for $15.  The spicy salmon hand roll, instead of being crisp, was chewy and flaccid.  Normally I find a hand roll has fish right to the bottom of the cone, but this one faded to pure rice halfway down.  The octopus sushi reminded me of accidentally eating a piece of pre-chewed gum a week later.  I found that if I took the fish off two pieces of sushi and put it on one portion of rice, the proportion became reasonable.  However, the fish was not as fresh as most sushi restaurants, and I would rate the freshness at the sushi kiosk in the food court of Upper Canada mall better.  Should I have gone with the AYCE instead?  No.  At most restaurants, all you can eat is made in advance, so it could be sitting since the morning.  Golden Maki in Newmarket does all you can eat the right way, making it mostly when ordered, and is pure gourmet in comparison."}
{"text":"Went to Akita for the first time with colleagues from work for lunch today.  Service was prompt & friendly, food was visually appealing, fresh and tasty.  Good selection of dishes at a fair price."}
{"text":"Good sushi, not great but would recommend for an all you can eat sushi place. We liked the salmon sashimi, gold roll and Tuna mango. Wouldn't recommend the spicy tuna nigiri."}
{"text":"Service sucked. Don't speak English. Took about 3 hours for sushi when it should take an hour at most."}
{"text":"My \"Fortress of Solitude\" place - brings back memories of some AYCE places I've been to in Norther California.  Basics: Seating at booths, tables, or up at the sushi bar counter. Place your drink order with the server. (Generous refills on non-alcoholic drinks!) Check off your selections (sushi, sashimi, appetizers, hot wok items, and dessert.) from the paper slips, and off you go.  Tip: Plan your orders as needed, as everything is made to order. Also, keep in mind that your eyes may be bigger than your stomach. There is a $5 charge if you're not able to finish what you ordered. I've only fallen to that once. (Once - during lunch. I'm pretty good otherwise.)  The miso soup is pretty basic, but then, it's about the sushi and sashimi here. The tempura battered shrimp and veggies are pretty much what you can expect for decent stuff. (The shrimp are delightfully crunchy outside, tender inside!), and I have not been let down by the fish, either by itself on beds of shredded daikon (white radish), or in rolls, or as nigiri (Fish on rice.)  Keep in mind that sometimes they do run out of garden salad. I do agree with Ian L's writeup, they could stand to improve the salad dressing, but if you want greens with your fish, go for it. ^_^ (They do also offer Edamame, in generous portions for one, or to share with others in your group.)  Personal favorites for the special rolls: Amazing Tuna Roll, Out of Control Roll, and Tuna Mango Roll.   I'm usually there every week or two, decent value, food, though I usually hold court there for about an hour, it's a good place to check out. (Parking can get a bit packed some weeknights.)"}
{"text":"I've been here many times before. I'm giving this place 4 stars. Their \"all hand made food\" to oder is really tasty, affordable, and portion sized. I would give this place a 5 but their service and ordering certain foods doesn't come in a timely manner. Often times my order was forgotten or not even brought out to me, that's the only disappointing part. So you end up waiting for a couple more minutes if you get lucky."}
{"text":"Cheapest all you can eat sushi with decent quality that I've been to in Phoenix, not that I've been too much.  Came here around lunch time on a Saturday. Lunch all-you-can-eat pricing is around $15 a person. pricing is definitely good.  You get a menu and you get to choose what you want and they make the order on the spot. Which is definitely a plus instead of having it pre-made.  I don't really eat much of the raw stuff. So my favorite was the eel. Definitely recommend getting the hand rolls over the regular rolls. They don't skip out on the quantity. Also I had some tamago, which was okay. Shrimp and roll, shrimp tempura rolls were average.  I do like their seaweed salad, Garden salad was okay as well but was mainly cucumbers on top.  Fried scallop was also good as well, would pass on the Yakitori's.  Finished it with a green tea ice cream, which is pretty good. Not too sweet, but you will finish that one scoop and want a little more. But summer shredding.  Menu is pretty extensive especially if you like the raw stuff and they also have fried rice and udon noodles, but I was full already.   Menu does mentioned that you will get charged for food that you don't finish, so order what you can eat. Don't be greedy.   Service is pretty fast and friendly.  Decent parking lot outside."}
{"text":"Mmmm. This place was good. Pretty good. I'd rate it a 3 star but I feel like it was just a bit closer to a 4 due to the convenience of being able to mix and match small tastes and had other options for the all-you-can-eat aspect other than just sushi. I felt like it was clean but wish I had a bit of a cleaner vibe from this place. That's where the 3 comes in a bit! Overall, decent experience and would probably go back again."}
{"text":"For the price I have never had a better deal in America. When I first started coming here the sushi was mediocre, they have worked and made it a lot better. They have a good selection of traditional rolls as well as new fusion.  If you are eating with someone who doesn't like sushi, this is a great place as they have a good variety of non Japanese items. My girlfriend and I come here and she always gets the cheese puffs. GET THE CHEESE PUFFS.   I love this place."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - The La's - There She Goes)  A--Ki--Ta Akita Sushi Review with my brain And I just can't contain This taste that remains  A--Ki--Ta Akita Sushi Bo Bites thru my site... And I just can't contain This taste that remains  Sushi buffet time!   I came on a Friday night with my group.  ALL YOU CAN EAT sushi/sashimi for $20 - count me in!  I went for sashimi; mackerel, tuna, salmon, tempura vegetable, and the Volcano Roll.  The sashimi to me was pretty good and basic and so was the tempura vegetable.  The Volcano roll came with tuna, crab, cucumber and deep fried while drizzled with chipotle mayo, siracha, and a brown sweet sauce I couldn't make out. I would say this combo worked well.    Things got more interesting when Chef Sam came out to speak to us about what he can do and make for us; so I was like well show us what you can do!  Thus, he made us some specialties; Smoky Roll, Nanuto Roll, and Ninja Roll.  The Smoky roll was crab meat, seaweed salad, topped with yellowtail, salmon roe and doused with mayo and brown sauce; and yes you can taste the smoke, which was the interesting part.  The Ninja roll was a clean roll; no rice, just wrapped with seaweed was tuna, crab, avocado, and topped with wasabi aioli.  The Nanuto roll, my favorite of the night, was again a clean roll; wrapped with cucumber, salmon, tuna, roe, and drizzled with ponzu sauce!  Overall the experience took a 180 once Chef Sam came out to speak to us and show us is specialty!  Service overall was on top of things and the place was clean and welcoming.  In the end, gotta thank Chef Sam for making this a wonderful experience! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We have spent quite a lot of time at Teharu and decided to try this place. We really liked the unique dishes on the conveyor and ordered a lot if specialty items right from the chef. The sushi was clearly top rate, more equivalent to that of a full service sushi bar. The service was exceptional even though they have only been in business a few months. Yep it costs more than Teharu but the quality and taste was there. My wife and I will be back to sample the more extensive menu!"}
{"text":"All you can eat lunch is $11.99!!!  A group of us from work (all of them are Japanese) went for lunch the other day.  Not the best sushi but their food was great for the price. We tried everything on the sushi menu.  I would recommend avoiding noodles (ramen or udon).  Broth was weak and noodle wasn't what I am used to see as ramen or udon.  Bathroom was clean, interesting decor.  Service was good, they kept coming back to refill our drinks and took additional orders."}
{"text":"Going here twice in a week is what I call worth it!!! As in $11.99 to eat all the sushi you want during lunch from 11am to 4pm. I mean seriously, if you are planning to spend more than $12 for sushi, you need to come here. It is definitely a \"Your money's worth\" situation! Two specialty rolls at other restaurants cost more than this.  It's all you can eat on anything from appetizers such as shrimp tempura, seaweed salad to dessert such as fried bananas and green tea ice cream. You also have chicken, beef, salmon cutlet, ramen, udon, maki rolls, hand rolls, nigiri pieces and so on. The drinks do cost extra money though. I usually stick with water.  The pieces are decently made and they are not overstuffed with rice. I'm glad the owners are respecting the customers in that regard. The fish is decently fresh as well. So for moderate pricing and decent sushi that is way worth your money, you need to come to Akita.  I think I ate about 30-40 pieces of sushi every time I went not including the seaweed salad, shrimp tempura, miso soup, friend bananas and other random things. You can also order their specialty rolls which include Las Vegas, Manhattan, Rainbow and 3 other specialty rolls. Usually I always eat about 6-10 salmon nigiri pieces first because salmon is just that good. :)  This place is awesome, but it could use more than 2 waitress since everything is made to order (not buffet style) and then brought to your table. I also had several instances where they just forgot what I ordered and didn't bring it. Or they got the order itself wrong on certain sushi pieces. They could put more specialty rolls on their menu too."}
{"text":"All-you-can-eat sushi in general raises eyebrows.  I went in there twice in two weeks now, hoping to get a good feel for this place the second time around...  Pricepoint: Pretty good for lunch, $14-16 including tip.  Quality of the food for a all you can eat: Honestly, surprising. The nigiri sushi is clearly sliced thinner than normal, though the variety of nigiri is fairly good. Having mackerel is always good and shows that the owner insists on a good variety.   Why go there: The variety of the all you can eat menu is very good. The hot kitchen cranks out some pretty good hot food, sushi isn't necessarily the star here. The tempura'd pieces are good, the oil they are fried in is clean, though most of what they call tempura is panko, which means... They are frozen goodies dropped in the deep fryer! With this volume I don't blame them. Nevertheless, they are not bad. Same thing with the gyoza. There is soup and grilled things, even dessert. You can't beat the price and the service is decent, they could use more smiles on their faces though as my wife says.  Verdict: Good spot for a filling lunch with a buddy or dinner, to shoot the breeze, eat slow and not really have specific cravings for anything in particular, but you know you want Japanese... I sense though the owners are not, as the food reflects a few other cultures in its details. They do crank out the food rather fast.  Try: The fried scallops, the shrimp tempura is good too when it comes to the fried stuff (panko'd). Give their Rainbow roll a shot, it was their most thoughtful and fresh roll. If you don't mind thin nigiri go for it, you just might have to load up. The mango ice cream makes for a good ending."}
{"text":"Recently moved to Scottsdale from Las Vegas. There were 2 in Vegas we really liked and it's nice to have found an All-You-Can-Eat Sushi place that is really good. Even though their menu is pretty good, it does lack a little bit on a variety of choices we were used to. Regardless, this is our second time here so that accounts for something! :)"}
{"text":"I agree with a lot of other reviews.  PROs -  Friendly accommodating service Decent tasting food Price is a deal Soups, salads and dessert is included in the AYCE price A lot of the sushi rolls are sweet (but you could order them without the sweet icky sauce)  Cons - Food is ok but not great Dirty bathroom Lots of rice, less fish in the rolls The actual dishes do not look anything like the pictures of the dishes   In order to control all the rice in the sushi rolls, order sashimi instead of sushi, and just order a bowl of rice on the side. They have around a half dozen kinds of fish to choose from but when filling out the sashimi form, you are ordering by the \"piece\" and not an \"order\" of the said fish. The pieces are tiny, so if you want tuna, for instance, order at least 6 pieces.   The seaweed salad is good."}
{"text":"So I just finished my meal and accidentally left my phone at the table. I left noticed I forgot and ran inside.  I asked my server and everyone working \" have u seen my phone?\" Im a female and they said no.?!?! Even though I knew my phone was there. I ran outside to my car and asked my boyfriend to come inside to ask for my phone and they handed it to him quickly. My point of the msg is  Is they tried to punk me for my iPhone 8? That's pretty fucked up"}
{"text":"They have all of you can eat sushi for lunch and dinner now. The restaurant will start doing the revolving sushi bar arounf fall or winter. I just got out of the restaurant and I'm stuffed. The eel roll, salmon teriyaki and salmon nigiri tasted so fresh and amazing. You can eat until you can't walk anymore for just $12. I have never seen that price for sushi. The waitress was very kind, courteous and super friendly. This is the second time that I've been here and I absolutely love that place. Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"Self proclaimed sushi addict, family claims \"sushi-nut\" , and I LOVE this place - fast, friendly, very affordable and excellent tasting and quality sushi. And a lot of fun. 5 stars and highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was misled into this place thinking it was a revolving sushi bar but when I walked inside, it was clearly not. I was seated in a booth and my waitress did not speak very good English. I had to call her over every time I wanted to order or needed a refill on my water. I did come in for lunch and was told about the all you can eat lunch. I felt this was a good deal so I ordered. The flavor of the sushi was just OK- nothing tasted great.   I would not return."}
{"text":"I give 3 stars for the great services and value....  Yes it is super cheap for all you can eat but the food was pretty bad  First. The deep fried scallop is fake! I asked the waiter and he admitted yea we use fake meat like imitation crab. But you should make a note on the menu!  Second the foods from the wok is soo soggy! Nothing like stir fried foods.   Nigiri sushi has big chunk of rice and super thin fish but thats ok bc sashimi is very expensive."}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow. More than half of the order was lost. It took 20 min for an ice cream to arrive."}
{"text":"Akita sushi was a great place for our date night. They have an excellent selection of sushi as well as tempura, soups, yakitori, and salad.   If your on the fence about trying and AYCE sushi spot? Get over it and check this place out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service was fast, they had fried salmon belly (rarely any place has that).  Lunch on Sunday was 16.99 per person.  Only think I didn't like was the avocado salad, it was a potato salad dressing on lettuce topped with avocado.  So the avocado was not the main feature of the dish.  The menu item should be renamed.  I did like the strawberry ice cream, the picture on menu showed strawberry ice cream with strawberry jelly and the served ice cream matched!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food. All you can eat sushi and Japanese for $20 per person. Sam, the Owner, is so great, so pleasant, and made us feel so welcome. The food was delicious, the staff is courteous and we had a great time. One can order whatever you want off the menu, and keep ordering until one cannot eat anymore. Our friends kept raving about this place, and we finally were able to go. We wish we came a lot sooner! Please visit Akita's. It is well worth it!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi places to go to. What's great is that it is an all you can eat and it's pretty affordable. They have a lot of amazing and delicious rolls you can choose from and they recently just renovated with iPads as well!  The service is alright, not always the best but it isn't bad either. The place is clean and quiet most of the time and the attire is casual. My favourite rolls are the Philadelphia rolls, hamburger rolls and the green dragon rolls. I definitely always order the spicy mussels AND the salmon sashimi."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  Akita has a great variety of specialty rolls- something that's been hard to find since moving to the area. And it's wayyy cheaper than the trendy places. I ordered takeout so the presentation wasn't phenomenal but there was a super generous serving of blue crab in my roll. They were a little hard to understand but very friendly. Also have an all you can eat sushi special for under $12."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi restaurants I've been to! My husband and I came here for happy hour and we both were impressed by the quality of food and the prices.  The twin towers roll was delicious.. As well as a few other rolls I haven't seen before.  The service is also fabulous.  Our waiter recommended 2 crab sushi rolls that weren't on the conveyer belt because they wouldn't have kept well for a long period of time.  They were both unique and flavorful.  Then we received a 20% off coupon for our next visit.  Great new gem in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"$11.99 lunch for AYCE quality Sushi! Yes, it's hard to believe. But we found it! For sure, the fish is fresh. The rice is sweet and soft as sticking rice. Very good deal, at the same time, good quality. Dinner is $22, but has sashimi, but there still lots of variety you can choose to satisfy your big appetite at lunch time. If next time I come Scottsdale, I'll definitely come to this place."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money... Regardless of price, even if this was only $5, still go to another place!!! The food is horrible. The fish is not fresh, the rolls are unedible, boring and they fall apart. They use the same batter to cook your shrimp tempura and fried bananas. But on top of it all, the service is horrendous!!  There's one server whose always there,  tall guy with glasses, he will never come back to check on you. You barely get greeted, then you never see him again... No, \" how was everything\" is there anything else I can get you?\". We had to get up several times to ask for refills on water, to order more food, and to ask why our food was taking an hour long, when there were only 4 tables in the whole restaurant. He's absolutely horrible. Then drops off the bill when you're not even done! On top of that, the manager or owner, whoever stands in front where the register is, is so unfriendly, unprofessional and makes you feel like he doesn't want you there.  There are so many places in Scottsdale for AYCE sushi... Go there instead! Might as well go to your local Fry's for sushi, at least there nice."}
{"text":"First time we visited, I indulged in the conveyor belt sushi-go-round. It was good (but not life-altering for the price) and I was almost dissuaded from visiting them a second time.   This time, however, I did the all-you-can-eat ($11.99/person??!!! YEAH!) and it was SCRUMPTIOUS! DELECTABLE! DELIGHTFUL! and oh so tasty.   We ordered miso soup, teriyaki eggplant, edamame, volcano rolls, manhattan rolls, and a variety of tempuras (including shrimp, crab, scallops, and banana w/ honey and chocolate for dessert). The only thing that wasn't a hit was the spicy tuna, but at that point we were so happy with everything else that it is barely worth mentioning.   The service was excellent and attentive.  I will DEFINITELY return...maybe even this week. YUM!"}
{"text":"Great sushi for the price!  Service was great, the fish was fresh.  All in all a very enjoyable experience.  No complaints and will come back again."}
{"text":"I didn't love this place as much as I'd hoped I would. The sushi was good but even for \"all you care to eat\" it still seemed pricey to me. The bill for my family of 4 was just under $100. Not outrageous but still a little steep for the quality. There is a very generous variety of sushi to chose from. But, it was just mediocre in flavor. It does take a long while for the orders to come out. Possibly just a slower moving night for the chefs? We might give it another try eventually but I'm not rushing back."}
{"text":"Place was very loud and noisy, we waited for food for 1 and half and got half of our order. Manager was rude,m. Never going back there."}
{"text":"Food is okay, nothing special. The service itself is poor. I keep giving it a \"shot\" because it's in town but I know there is so much better in the Newmarket/Aurora area. If you are a first timer here- take a look at your bill. They include their own tip and refrain from telling you."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for basically. I went during the lunch all you can eat, and it was not as good as the other reviews hyped it up to be. Everything was plain dry except for the Las Vegas roll and they barely give you any fish. You're basically just eating rice with some veggies. Also the miso soup was old or overcooked! The seaweed is suppose to be soft not crunchy"}
{"text":"So yummy .... my first time there tonight and I will for sure be back :) the sushi was all fresh ... I didn't try anything but the sushi but all the other stuff on menu looks great also"}
{"text":"I love this place. Our servers are always very kind and service is always fast. Food always tastes wonderful too. And the bill is always way less than it would be if you went to any other sushi place. My boyfriend and I love coming here."}
{"text":"I've been twice now with a friend and I must say I am a fan. I like that for $12 you can get all you can eat sushi including seaweed salad, tempura, etc.- basically it's a buffet freshly ordered and prepared.   I will be honest and write that I was initially skeptical at the quality of the sushi for the price. And I was pleasantly surprised!  The nigiri is tasty and fresh, not on giant pieces of rice as it sometimes can be.   I usu get the miso soup, seaweed salad, yellowtail, salmon, tuna, California roll and that's pretty much all I can eat before becoming full.   Next time I need to bring some more friends so we can order more sushi and rolls together for me to taste some of the speciality rolls.   The clean rolls Bao H. described sounds wonderful. I will have to order those next time I go in.   The only minor comment I will make is that despite the fact that the interior is nicely decorated, the now defunct conveyor belt for the rotating sushi is a distraction. It makes a poor impression upon initial walk in.   I'm not sure what they can do about it since I am sure it was expensive to install & will be expensive to remove.   Aside from this minor distraction, this place is great for an all you can eat sushi joint!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for the all-you-can-eat lunch special. I was able to enjoy edamame, miso soup, vegetable & shrimp tempura, and multiple different rolls that were all included in the special. So the special isn't just exclusive to sushi which was really nice and cheap. Food was good, not the best quality ever but the service was wonderful and it's overall a good little spot that isn't too expensive if you're just wanting a decent lunch."}
{"text":"Highly recommend for those who love sushi  Kind and quick service Sushi does not dissapoint  Great price given the region (north Scottsdale)"}
{"text":"Sushi was pretty good tasting for Bradford at least however the prices are pretty high for what you get.  The issue we had with Akita was that the service was much less than stellar. The first order of sushi had decent turn around time although there were mistakes and the second time we had to wait over 10 minutes before we waved down our waitress and asked what the status was.  The restaurant was very busy this evening so I hope I'm a one off case and others get better service in the future. The manager at the end discounted our bill and was very polite."}
{"text":"Like the previous reviewer, I did not like this new restaurant. Visually it was cold and reminded me of an institutional cafeteria. The food also reminded me of cafeteria food and supermarket sushi.  Why were they charging $8.99 for a glass of wine?   There are better options in Brampton."}
{"text":"I have been to their new Brampton restaurant and found it to be vastly inferior to any other AYCE restaurant that I had been to. Dining standards must be very low in Woodbridge. Are they charging $8.99 for a glass of plonk in Woodbridge or are they just trying to rip off residents of Brampton?  ."}
{"text":"The all you can eat lunch here is incredible. I've come probably 5 times now and the sushi is all made to order. The fish also tastes surprisingly fresh for an all you can eat lunch. My favorite here is anything with Salmon. Honestly haven't had a bad dish here (except the deep fried scallops aren't great). I do wish they had some kind of scallop roll but it's understandable for buffet style. The service is friendly and beyond worth the price. I would recommend this place to everyone!  UPDATE (03/04/2018) I have visited this restaurant probably just under ten times now and every single time that I have been, the food has been wonderful and delicious. I have had a couple visits that had long wait times for food but what do you expect with freshly made sushi? Either way, you cannot go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"I can't explain how happy I am to have found this place thanks to my friends who live in Scottsdale!! This is one of the best place EVER. I am from Hawaii and I think it's better. That's a lot to say. It's $13 all you can eat and there is more than just sushi. They have soup and fried rice for those that do not like sushi.   Staff are friendly and they are super fast in serving. I have never waited 15 minutes for the food. We live in yuma and we think it is worth the drive. I request everyone try it out just once. It won't disappoint you."}
{"text":"I always like all-you-can-eat sushi places because it gives you the opportunity to venture outside your comfort zone with minimal risk.  Akita was great for this reason.  Good quality, good variety, friendly service.  Tempura was too thick, but the zucchini and shrimp were the best of what I tried.  The red snapper and tuna were my favorites as both nigiri and sashimi, but that is likely just preference.  The unagi nigiri was nice too.  The rolls are small, but that's nice, because you have room for more variety.  I always like rainbow rolls and Akita's were delicious.  My hands down favorite was the special roll with spicy tuna and avocado topped with with cracked black pepper crusted tuna, tempura flakes and eel sauce.  So good, one of the best combos I've tried.  If you're looking for the finest sushi in Scottsdale, this is not your spot, but you want a nice meal out with friendly staff and delicious sushi, Akita is a great spot."}
{"text":"It was a great lunch! Price stated $11.99 per person for \"gorge as much as you want\" on their ordering sheet, but got charged $12.99. I saw the sign at the door when I left. Other than that, it was awesome!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant at least 10 times. The food is excellent, however, the service is pretty hit or miss. The first couple of times I went here the service was great. However, the last couple of times have been disappointing. I am an avid miso soup lover, thus I will often order soup with every round of sushi. With that said, this last time I came here, the waiters were rude and were constantly laughing at my order to one another. I understand that miso soup is typically not ordered multiple times, however, that is not a reason to make fun and joke around about my order. I did not feel welcomed and extremely disappointed with my last visit. Additionally, I ordered a hot green tea and had to continually ask for refills, while also reminding my waiter multiple times that food we had ordered had not been brought out yet."}
{"text":"Came here expecting conveyor belt sushi for dinner. They have closed it. Instead, we had an all you can eat dinner for $21 + drinks a person. Only order what you can eat. You will be charged for leftovers. Expect buffet quality food. It's good!!!!!! But it's what you pay for. We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and the food is pretty good.  However, the staff don't speak very good English and are very unenthusiastic to clear your plates and take orders.  Some of the servers smelled like marijuana today which I find very disappointing.    Although I enjoy the quality of food for $11.99 lunch special I won't be back due to the staff and the drugs here.  Don't forget the bill includes gratuity."}
{"text":"Great service. Good sushi. All you can eat.  What's not to like?  Went for lunch and had a wide assortment of FRESHMADE sushi and rolls.  No buffet here.  The waitress takes your order and then they make it up.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"For a long time this was the only all you can eat sushi place in Woodbridge. I believe it opened around 2007 and 2008 and when I lived in Woodbridge this place was a regular joint for dinner for maybe 5 or 6 years. often waiting an hour or more and always packed.  The quality and volume was great back then in a simple yet effective restaurant space. fast forward 10 to 11 years later and I still think this is a great place to go. They've played a lot with raising their prices and charging a 10% tip included but I think they've got it right with the take out and AYCE menu.  same recipe they use for their spicy and crispy tempura stuff and it tastes great. I picked up take out here the other day but had AYCE a few months ago and was haply with both selection and restaurant.  atmosphere  It's a modern looking place with lots of nice accents and lighting. TV and full bar though only for ordering from.  food  lots of selection and it's got iPad ordering. order the classics and most of the rolls and be happy with this Chinese made sushi as it's good for volume.  value  their platter and take out specials are actually very reasonable. look at menu pics and you get a lot for your money.  4 out of 5. I debated a 3.5 but to be honest it's still above average for an AYCE joint."}
{"text":"This is the best all you can eat sushi I've ever been to! $21 for everything. It includes everything from gyoza, tempura, sashimi and maki and so so much more. We came in on a Friday night and it was full, but not crazy. The two for one sake and beer was just the icing on the cake. I'll definitely be back here when I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We went to Akita Sushi for dinner last night.  There are sashimi on the all you can eat menu.  Yellow tail, white tuna, tuna just to name a few.  The cuts are generous and great.  It's such an amazing value.  The food is delicious."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Anita for years and tonight was the ultimate experience. The food was fresh. Served hot. Amazing service. Fantastic quality.   Sushi was all right on point which is rare for an AYCE. Wow  Sashimi was so fresh and delicious   And the new items on the menu were amazing. Shrimp skewers. Tempura calamari. And more. OMG  The chicken and beef teriyaki were amazing. Butterfly cheese were to die for.   Even he udon noodles were perfect.    Tonight the stars aligned for an incredible sushi experience. Since the updating and renovations this place is a true hidden gem.   You have got to eat here."}
{"text":"My fav sushi restaurant! Sushi is always delicious and fresh tasting.  Always in a food coma when I leave.  The weekend menu has some amazing rolls! Ok service; better than most sushi restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"11.99 for nigiri that has too much rice to taste the sashimi. It's understandable that they need to make profit and putting too little rice would take away from that profit margin but it's a problem when all you can taste is rice. Second round of nigiri had horrible quality sashimi so as someone else has stated before make sure to order what you think you'll need the first time around.   As for the service expect it to be very slow and horrible. Everyone there gets super defensive when you ask them something as if they'll get in trouble for doing something wrong. For example, we told them that we had ordered a hand roll and not the regular roll and one of the waiters (Asian guy who seems like he has something stuck up his ___) got very defensive saying that he wasn't the one who took our order so it's not his fault. All we were asking was to possibly get another order of hand rolls, which shouldn't be a problem as it is an ALL YOU CAN EAT RESTAURANT. The only plus was the lady waitress who was the best and most normal.   But in the end it's 11.99, which is pretty much what stopped me from teaching this restaurant a lesson on what service should be like. Hence the 2 stars instead of 1 that they rlly deserve."}
{"text":"It is an all you can eat buffet but they make the food fresh and fast. There was no wait time. They have large tables for parties or celebration. I went there with my family for Mother's Day."}
{"text":"For an all you can eat sushi joint this place is great. Fish is super fresh. Rice is well done. I eat here whenever I am in town.   No it's not a super great expensive sushi bar, but for what it is,  it's perfect. The balance of price to sushi quality is right on the money.   I would be hesitant to bring someone here who has never eaten sushi before. But for people who enjoy sushi, And don't need super  expensive 5 star sushi this place is great."}
{"text":"So yummy and we went on a Tuesday night at 7 and the place was empty so not much waiting for our rolls. For sure will be back at the price of $21.99 for all-you-can-eat per adult."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 4.5 stars because I think the only downfall I experienced could be easily improved upon.  The food is wonderful.  The sushi is delicious -- I had several different rolls, including the California Roll, Spicy Tuna, and Green Dragon.  No complaints about the sushi.  The tempura is good, too -- nice and lightly crispy.  The udon is very decent, and the pork cutlet that came with it was cooked perfectly.  The ice cream is okay, but the fried banana with honey is probably the best banana I've ever had in my life.  I went for dinner, which was $20.  It's a little pricey, but I hear that the lunch menu is very similar but only $12.    The one thing I think could be improved is their efficiency.  There's nothing wrong with the servers -- they're very friendly and helpful.  Even the owner came to say hi, and he hopped in to help when things got busy.  However, I feel like they all work too hard.  Work smart, not hard, right?  They're literally running around, trying to keep up with the demands of the tables.  They do a great job given how many people they have, but with current circumstances, it's just not feasible.  There were times when my table waited five to ten minutes to get a hold of a server, and they weren't standing around lazily ignoring us, either -- they were BUSY.  Akita Sushi either needs to hire an extra server or two OR they need to change the ordering system.  All in all, it's a great experience if you have the time.   I will be back, though, and I hope things run a bit more smoothly next time.  I'll keep this review updated!"}
{"text":"Came here only once for lunch when they first opened...vowed never to come back..I kind of enjoy the conveyor belt sushi concept...as I think of it as the 'fast food' of sushi..On the day we came here, there was hardly anyone in the place and the sushi on the conveyor belt was warm and mushy, like it had been traveling around the conveyor way too long.  Hopefully this new 'all you can eat' concept that they are trying now will help keep them in business..."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite sushi restaurant in town. Their is a unlimited menu for $20 as an adult. Their is a great miso soup and edamame. Their is also a great crunchy roll that is my favorite roll they have. I mainly love this place because of the excellent prices for the tasty food."}
{"text":"OMG. This place is fantastic. My husband can eat his weight (and then some) in sushi. For $20 per person all you care to eat, he leaves happy and satisfied.  He loves all the sashimi options. The food is cooked to order so it is not spinning around on a conveyor belt for lord knows how long.  I'm not a fish eater and find plenty of yummy options. It's clearly stated to only order what you will eat so don't complain if they try to charge you for ordering too much. What he is able to consume would cost us over $100 at other sushi places.  This place is a gem and we will continue to go there often."}
{"text":"Quality Sashimi cold thick pieces Great Sushi rolls All you can eat dinner for $22 Great bargain great place to go"}
{"text":"Prices here are great. My wife and I were skeptical of an all you can eat sushi place. But it isn't a buffet. Quality of food is good. Our favorite was the white tuna sashimi."}
{"text":"Wow. $11.99 for a made to order / all-you-can-eat sushi lunch??? Sign me up! Fresh fish and so many options. I love that you can order nigiri and tempura by the piece. It allows you to try everything! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for AYCE sushi. Can't beat the price. Took my son who was $10 for dinner. He definitely ate more than $10 worth. They also have sashimi on the AYCE menu without limits. Amazing. Overall quality of the fish was acceptable, not fishy but not super high quality either. The rice needs work. I'm pretty sure it's unseasoned sticky rice. No flavor.   Good variety of hot foods and sushi on the menu. My son had a bunch of gyoza and the udon. Don't get the tempura udon. The tempura was two fried sticks of imitation crab. Scarfed them down but not good. The tempura shrimp was thick breading with small shrimp.   Overall a good deal for AYCE sushi that is pretty hard to come by in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Alright....4 stars is only because the food is really really good. I would have given 2 stars if it wasn't because the service is slow. When I saay slow I mean real slow...and inaccurate. Lol we had to laugh but you get a paper to mark off what your table wants. Then the waiting begins...and stuff starts coming in intervals. Some of the items we ordered we had to put 3 papers in...but I think at this point other tables are tired of waiting and when the waiter asks them if the order belongs to them they just take what they want instead of waiting another hour. The waiter even asked us to please be honest in a frantic display of desperation to bring out the correct food. Overall I would be back for a good laugh and good food. The price is good but be prepared to be patient!"}
{"text":"The best sushi I've ever had!! The staff was friendly and super quick. We came in with a large group but they kept drinks refilled and food was brought out quickly. The owner was out on the floor as well checking in with tables and making sushi suggestions. He even offered creations not on the menu that he was working on and thought we'd enjoy based on our orders.   Our group was on vacation in the area and stumbled on this restaurant. We will definitely be back and recommend this to others!!"}
{"text":"Pretty nasty Sushi. I would avoid. Can't be all things to all people. Any time your sushi place has ice cream, avoid!!"}
{"text":"Had the AYCE dinner menu on a weekend. For starters, the selection on the iPad ordering system was amazing! Some options that I haven't seen at other AYCE sushi places included curry Katsu dons (chicken/pork cutlet on rice with Japanese curry sauce), soba noodles and lobster sushi rolls! However, the quality and taste did not match what I was expecting. Curry was not fragrant, spicy tuna/salmon crisp rolls were mainly tempura flakes rather than fish. My first order of sashimi had a film of liquid under them, an obvious sign that they had been frozen. Moving on to the service, the restaurant was not too busy. There were many vacant booths, so one would expect to have a lot of interaction with waiters. However, I had empty dishes piling at my table and constantly called the waiters over for refills (there was no option on the iPad). To be fair, they did seem short staffed. Overall, good food but service needs a bit of improvement!"}
{"text":"Akita Sushi is my favorite restaurant in Arizona. I love the fact that it's not just sushi that is all you can eat, but rather, the entire menu. For $11.99?! Can't beat that!   Just make sure you ONLY order what you can eat. You don't want to take advantage of the restaurant(plus they might make you pay for it)"}
{"text":"Why did I give this place 5 stars? One word: VALUE!  As you should know, this place is an all you can eat place. There are two prices: around $15 for lunch & around $21 for dinner. The extra price for dinner is because they add certain items for dinner like certain special sushi rolls. But I almost always go for lunch because their variety is still great.  Now food quality. DO NOT expect 5 star sushi quality ok? Be reasonable. Their fish is not flown in from Japan daily ok? But it is still good quality for the price. Again, my word was VALUE. For the price, the food is great!   Recommendation: Gold Roll. I have yet to find a better tasting roll ANYWHERE. Its freakin' great. I also like the nigiri because its thinner pieces of fish which I like.   Overall, try this place if you love sushi. One of my absolute favorites."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and my only regret is that there's so many good items my friends and I always over order which results in us stuffing ourselves to we hate ourselves! I'm not really sure how a ayce sushi place can only be $12 for lunch and still remain open because the sushi is actually surprisingly good!   With the lunch buffet there's a menu of 100+ items that you can order including many tempura items, nigiri, pork/chicken cutlet, soba/udon/Ramen, sea weed salad and a myriad of both regular and specialty rolls! And to top it off you can get mango, green tea, or vanilla ice cream to finish off your meal!   The price and quality definitely can't be beat and it's a nice surprise that there's so many appetizers/sides you can order as well (in comparison to mido sushi in Chandler). Unfortunately it seems like they do mix up orders quite a bit cause the last two times I've gone, we've had some repeat on rolls and even rolls arrive that we didn't order. On a side note, check out the bathroom, it's pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Not the worst, not the best.   Pros: - Fast service - Huge selection (more so at dinner, but you're paying the difference) - Butterfly cheese (Nom, so good)  Cons: - They automatically add 10% tip to the bill (so don't add on top of that!)  - The bill is given to you right after you order ice cream, which i think is kind of rude  Overall, I would say that it's a pretty standard AYCE Japanese sushi place. I've been coming here ever since I was in high school (which isn't saying really much if I won't disclose my age =p); however, this is more so because of it's convenient location than anything else. They've done some renovations recently which I personally think look ugly.  But hey, it's not a bad place. Generally speaking, AYCE sushi places are quite $$$ to begin with. I feel like the past reviews are a little harsh... but then again, to each his own?"}
{"text":"This place is by far my favorite to get sushi. Everything is made fresh to order and it's all you can eat! My wife and I went for lunch and it was the perfect time. No wait, we were greated and sat right away. You can select as many items as you want and reorder as much as you can handle. I tried the Las Vegas volcano roll for the 1st time and I wish I would have tried it sooner. It's a deep fried roll with crab and salmon with some spicy sauce spread across the top. It is now my favorite dish. Service was excellent, food came out quick and drinks were topped off. It was $15.50 a person with the drink plus tax, best deal around."}
{"text":"I went for the ayce dinner. The server didn't really greet us at the door and wasn't that friendly either.   There are a lot of choices in the dinner ayce menu but the quality of the food wasn't that great. The sashimi was cut in super small slices and they fill the sushi up with tons and tons of rice. I remember ordering a spicy salmon sushi and what came to the table was a mixture of tempura and spicy mayonnaise mixed together on top of the sushi... there wasn't even any fish in it.  The kitchen food was ok... I remember the chicken teriyaki was pretty good and the dessert was pretty average.   I definitely wouldn't choose to go back to this place.. there's a lot of better options out there."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and the staff was pretty nice- I feel like there was a language barrier but that's ok. All you can eat Sushi is great in theory, but the quality was just OK. To me, sushi is like pizza, even if it's not the best it's still good. My family is not so inclined, and were disappointed. My favorite item I had was the spicy Cali roll. The rice on most of the rolls was quite warm, which warmed the fish. Dinner price for all you can eat off the menu is 22.99. So unless you can throw down a lot of sushi, I would personally recommend a different place."}
{"text":"Unbelievably great sushi. Not like a typical all you can eat sushi place. This is really good quality sushi:-)  They have a wide variety of items and they often change their menu so it never gets boring.  He even has buy-one-get-one-free sake. Lol"}
{"text":"Akita offered some great service along with their great \"all you can eat\" prices! loved the food and the fun environment"}
{"text":"The all you can eat sushi is 11.99$ for a lunch menu you can order from as much as you want (but any leftover food will be charged to you accordingly) the dinner menu is a BEAST! 22$ and you have a wonderland of amazing food to choose from! The specialty rolls are SO DANG good. I wanna go every day, totally would if it was realistic   The appetizers are exceptional as well. Really I DARE you to try and find a better all you can eat (AYCE) sushi restaurant with such a flawless menu throughout! Do not pass up the green tea ice cream and deep fried bananas, also go wash your hands, you'll be in for a pleasant surprise in the unique decor of the restrooms. Be warned, it's usually pretty cold in there. Oh sounds so wrong...  But seriously, believe the hype, good AYCE sushi exists and it's right around the corner!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi for $12 and it's really good!!! Not the best I've had but REALLY GOOD totally worth the money!! The only thing I didn't like was the Vegas roll!! It is not good at all..I couldn't even finish the bite! And the Vegas roll is my favorite at my regular sushi place. Highly recommend the Edamame basket, the crab stick and the volcano roll Soooooooo good! Service is always great and it's a nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Decent sushi for a pretty darn good price! I went for lunch and was ablt to get a variety of sushi rolls, nigiris and a billion appetizer options for 15$. The sushi rolls weren't too rice heavy. Don't bother with the handrolls as those were 80% rice and 20% fish. The nigiris were pretty thinly sliced. No sashimi for lunch."}
{"text":"$12 all you can eat during per person the day and $20 per person at night. We often go at night because the price is still outstanding for the quality of food they serve. I have brought many friends and family here because of my positive experiences. I eat a lot of sushi and I can say this is some of the freshest around. Their tuna and salmon are so good! Because of the great value, don't expect to get in and out of here quickly. Expect to take your time and enjoy your meal with family and friends."}
{"text":"Great sushi and great price doesn't get any better! Best spot in the valley - other reviews simply don't make sense"}
{"text":"My elderly mother, sister and I went here when visiting our other family members in Scottsdale! When first entering we were greeted with a fine welcome and seated right away. We were tended to as soon as we were seated. Ordered food; which was then at our table in under 5 minutes! Very fast service for being decently busy. Sushi was grand and priced to the quality of the sushi."}
{"text":"I took a first date here, and we sat at the bar. We were the only ones there (at the bar), and we pigged out. Such great sushi, and great service. The fish tasted very fresh, and buy one beer, get the second for a penny! Can't beat that! I'm sure I'll be back here. I recommend the Amazing tuna roll. It has this peppered tuna on top that is seafood version of bacon."}
{"text":"I have never tried an AYCE sushi joint... But I have always been kind of curious so I thought I would give this place a try. Came in on Saturday night, place was slammed. For dinner its around $20.00 per person. They have a pretty diverse menu, sushi, ton's of apps, udon noodle soup, fried rice, chicken/steak and salmon teriyaki, etc. so there is something for everyone here.  - Service was spot on... Our waiter was friendly and attentive without being obtrusive.  - Food surprisingly wasn't bad... even the sushi quality was on par with what you would get at a RA or Stingray (in my opinion). - If your a fan of Americanized sushi (think Las Vegas rolls, Philly Rolls) this place is for you!  - Food came out quick and hot. Everything is prepared to order. - Skip the spicy scallop roll, I don't know what in the world the filling was, but It wasn't scallops.   Overall, I wasn't expecting a positive experience for my first AYCE sushi, so I was pleasantly surprised. When I am in the mood to eat my weight in sushi rolls and want a little bit of everything - Akita will be my spot!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was really good for what it is: a quick and relatively cheap spot to stop in for a sushi meal. It's got a nice build-out, very clean, decent atmosphere, and efficient service. The sushi is good--it's not trying to get at the top end of sushi dining like some of the much more renowned, gourmet places in town, but for what it's trying to be the quality is good. The prices are the best part: everything is $2-3 below what you might pay elsewhere. Plates start at $1.50 and top out at $5.00.  The $2.00 and $3.00 plates are primarily nigiri, the $4.00 and $5.00 plates are rolls and sashimi. We were able to feed three of us quite well with several drinks for just $50, and we were in and out in well under an hour.  If you're short on time and want a relatively inexpensive sushi meal this is your spot.   I did see some other reviewers refer to a \"dirty dining\" news report from a couple months ago...they even gave bad reviews while admitting they didn't even go to the restaurant, which I think does review sites like Yelp a disservice. Anyway, I was aware of that report and reviewed it before we visited. I can say that having worked in restaurants and dealt with inspections before, the violations were all very minor, things like missing consumer warnings about raw food on the menu (which we all know anyway) and some minor labeling or employee training issues.  According to the health dept website all violations were corrected on re-inspection a couple weeks later. So, while you should always check out a place before you eat there, I think you can't judge this place based upon the report that ran on the news without checking on both a) what the violations were, and b) the results of the follow up inspection.  You definitely shouldn't be judging a place you've never even visited. Just my two cents."}
{"text":"$11.99 all-you-can-eat at lunch!! Unlimited soups, sushi, udon dishes, soba noodle bowls, TERIYAKI SALMON (so good!!), tempura, appetizers, etc!!  Heads up, though: you get charged for any uneaten food, so pace yourself and only get one to two things at a time. The portions are small, so it's perfect if you want to try a bunch of different things."}
{"text":"The only all you can eat sushi I know of in the Phoenix area. They have AYCE sashimi which I thought was surprising they don't add too much rice into the orders of sushi which is awesome. Their ice cream is so rich and creamy - delicious. The only bad thing is that the sushi doesn't taste amazing. It's good for its price though $21/person for all you can eat."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!  Good selection of nigiri, rolls, and appetizers.  Solid quality and fast service. It really is all you can eat - and it's cheap!  I eat a lot  of sushi and would put this up against most anything else.  I wasn't a fan of their tempura batter, but everything else waaay outweighed that.  Will definitely come back. (Frequent traveller from out of town)"}
{"text":"I have to say: for all you can eat at these prices (under $20 for dinner and even less for lunch), it doesn't get much better than this!  Most all-you-can-eat places are either buffet or have a very limited menu.  Not Akita Sushi.  Special rolls included; a beer deal for buy one, get your second for a penny; a great variety of food even beyond sushi (tempura, ramen, fried rice and more) makes this place a great deal!  If I only lived closer, I could see becoming a serious regular as my whole family loves sushi and this place would make going out for dinner with five hungry kids actually affordable!  I recommend the spicy tuna hand roll-- delicious!-- although the soup and salad were a little too salty and sweet, respectively.  All the other dishes, however-- dumplings and spring rolls and sushi and more (oh my!)-- were delightful.  Portion size makes you mindful about choosing what to eat, and the fact that you can have as much as you want is pure indulgence.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food.  Excellent service and prompt preparation of food from sushi chefs and kitchen.   Not very busy on a Saturday night which makes me wonder if they'll be around for a while.  I'm sure that our bill at a regular sushi restaurant would have been $100+ but the tab for the two of us was $40 plus tip."}
{"text":"Prologue: My girlfriend and I are sushi fans and we're always on the lookout for something new and different. Generally speaking, I've found that the quality of all-you-can-eat sushi is usually acceptable and it's significantly more economical for me that a la carte. On the other hand, my girlfriend's sushi dining experiences in this part of the Phoenix Metro area have been limited to just one conveyor belt restaurant (see our review of Teharu Sushi on 10/21/16). So, an online search of all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants yielded some good reviews for Akita and we decided to give it a try.  The Plot: One of the best parts about all-you can eat is that you get to try lots of different items from the menu. My girlfriend and I shared several salads and appetizers, including Seaweed Salad, Avocado Salad, Salmon Teriyaki, Aged Tofu, and Fried Scallops. Our Nigiri selections included Masago, Tobiko, Red Clam, Mackerel, Tuna, Yellow Tail, and Salmon. The Maki rolls we tried included, Tuna, Eel Avocado, Sweet Potato Tempura, Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Crispy Onion, Manhattan, Kanpyo, and Gold. We wrapped things up with a taste of each of the desserts, which included Fried Bananas, Mango Sorbet, Green Tea Ice Cream, and Vanilla Ice Cream.  The Scene: We both agreed that the number and variety of menu items exceeded any of our previous experiences at this type of restaurant in southern Arizona. Overall the quality of the food was 3 stars and consistent with, and in some cases better than, what you would expect from a lunchtime all-you-can-eat sushi buffet. The salad and appetizer highlights for us were the Seaweed Salad, which was a good as we've had anywhere, the Salmon Teriyaki, which was very tasty, properly cooked, with good salmon flavor and not too much teriyaki flavor, and the Aged Tofu, which was interesting, different, and a much preferred alternative to Natto. The quality of the Nigiri was all as good as one would expect in this setting and my girlfriend was pleased with the portion sizes; however none of the items we ordered really stood out. We truly enjoyed all of the Maki rolls; the Manhattan was the most visually impressive, the Spicy Crispy Onion was new, different, and definitely worth a try, and the Kanpyo was the most traditional and also a new one for both of us.  The Rest of the Story: We thought it was noteworthy that all of the rolls can be ordered either as Maki or Temaki and all of the noodle dishes can be ordered either as Udon or Soba. Over the several courses we ordered I noticed that the quality of the rice varied. Sometimes it was warm with a nice texture and proper seasoning and at others it was a little cold, a little chewy, and consequently had less flavor. The Avocado Salad was okay but was essentially a waste of time; there are few other salads on the menu that are much better.  Epilogue: The main ingredient that raised our review from 3 to 4 stars was the price. It's safe to say you will not find a more economical lunchtime sushi option anywhere considering the variety and quality of the food. We are definitely planning to return to experience their more extensive dinner time menu. The service was prompt and courteous, all of our orders arrived fairly quickly, and my girlfriend, who is a native of mainland China, enjoyed chatting with the chefs at the bar, all of whom are from China and spoke Mandarin.

{"text":"This place is legit. Awesome sashimi and rolls with great service! I've been back a few times now and you  can't beat the value! Will always come back."}
{"text":"The sushi tasted stale and unfresh, the waitresses were apathetic, the atmosphere is over-the-top dark and the environment was simply as distasteful as the food itself. Would not recommend; neither for the price (which is steep), the food (I had to go to the washroom to avoid puking), and the service."}
{"text":"OK by far one of the best values in Scottsdale for what you get and excellent quality sushi, teriyaki beef, beef udon soup, gyoza... My guest and I have a new favorite place to eat.  The lunch price at $12.99 is one of the best kept secrets.   I also love that they do not hide from you and encourage you to order food.  Out server Brian was amazing and never let me glass of water go empty and was always there to make sure the food kept coming.  Ask to sit in Brian's section.  The atmosphere was quit and the booth seat were brand new and very comfortable to sit on.  I feel bad for the folks that did not have the experience we had, because everything was excellent, and not one complaint from our booth!  See you soon..."}
{"text":"I am hesitantly giving this establishment one star as there is not a option for zero stars. As, we went to the eating establishment not knowing it was all you can eat we ask the owner/manager if we could order from the menu in which case he indicated that we could. After having to almost trip the server to order and also receive our bill we were charged for a full all you can eat meals with only ordering 2 rolls and the server never even ask when and if we wanted anything else. Besides, the horrible service the food was sub par to say the least. I have never seen such small and stale tasting sushi. There is a great sushi restaurant down the road that is always packed. I'm sure the only reason this place has ANY business is overflow from the great place. When I told the manage/ owner that we would pay $40 for our meal he refused to give us back our credit card. I had no choice but to call the Scottsdale police when the owner started to yell and act obstinate to my 80 year old Mother. Very poor food and service. I am SURE they will be out of business quickly as nobody in Scottsdale is going to put up with either horrible service and awful stale fish. Which was slight in the rolls."}
{"text":"I love all you can eat sushi and I have my favorite spots I like to eat, this is not one of them unfortunately.  My boyfriend and I took some friends here from America and the food was really good and quick. They brought us some wrong items a few times and forgot my friends handrolls and sushi, which was...not cool. I live in Brampton and we used to have an Akita sushi, it was only okay as well.  My group still had a good time and filled up on the food but the menu is limited when it comes to sushi items, focusing more on teriyaki and other non-sushi items. Meh. I would not go back because there are much better sushi restaurants around, with a better wait team and menu."}
{"text":"It may not look like much from the outside, but inside is clean with nice decor. I have not found a better value in sushi anywhere either. All you can eat sushi can be a little suspect, but this place delivers on quality for the money.  Order anything on the menu and they will bring out as much as you want. And it's not just thrown on a plate. They make it look nice also. I tried eel for the first time and I enjoyed it, and since you don't pay per item, it's easier to try something new. The sweetheart roll and volcano roll were especially good. I will definitely go back, and maybe try something else I've never had."}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  The staff is really nice and friendly.  I'm not a big fan of the ordering system how everything you order is literally ONE instead of one order or serving.  Therefore you have to order a lot, and if you don't eat it all, they will charge you an additional amount for what you didn't eat.    Also, just a heads up, when they get busy, you will wait a very long time for your food."}
{"text":"Very good sushi for an all-you-can-eat sushi place. It is all made to order. Staff seems a bit timid. They work hard and seem understaffed. Their manager, however, he just stands their and doesn't seem to help much. Great sushi for the price. Their bathrooms are wild lol!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi establishment, wide variety of options to satisfy any sushi lover. The waiting staff are quick and efficient. The sushi is very good quality made on the order and fresh. The inside is cozy and beautiful, overall this is where you should be for business meetings and guest in town"}
{"text":"Excellent food for an excellent price. The all you can eat lunch is well worth it, two adults and one child can eat to satisfaction for a total of 35$, and that's pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Even for an all you can eat sushi place this was sub par. Service and staff were great, but I've had better sushi at the grocery store."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time for lunch and I have to say that I was pretty impressed! This restaurant is no longer a revolving sushi bar, however it is all you can eat. For lunch the prices were great - $12 a person.  The menu is kind of tricky to figure out at first because there are no prices or guidance for what you can order -- but you can order anything off the menu without restriction, and as many times as you want.  Each item comes in a small portion so they suggest you try it first before ordering multiple orders.  We went with the classic edamame, gyoza and shrimp tempura for apps, as well as miso soup and avocado salad.  The gyoza was one of my favorites and I thought it was well executed - crispy on the outside and flavorful on the inside.  They have a decent selection of sushi rolls and nigiri and I thought the quality of the salmon nigiri was actually really good.  My mom wanted the chicken katsu cutlet and that was dry and tough, I definitely wouldn't order that again.  Dessert was delicious - fried bananas and green tea ice cream. :)  Can't wait to bring my husband back here -- I'm sure he would love to eat his heart out!"}
{"text":"All you can eat for $23! This place is our go-to place for meeting up with groups of friends or even just a good cheat meal/date. They are reasonably priced and the sushi is great if not better than Raw. Why pay $10 a roll when you can have ALL the sushi you want for half the price?!"}
{"text":"This is my first experience with any type of AYCE sushi. And let me just start off by saying, I didn't have high expectations. This establishment is by no means terrible, and for an AYCE style restaurant the quality was acceptable. I will say that I did feel a bit sick after leaving, but that's probably because I ate more than I could handle.  The lunch special is extremely affordable and the nigiri is by far the best thing on the menu. However, I wasn't the biggest fan of the maki rolls, or the yakitori. The fish wasn't necessarily some of the best that I've ever had, but for the price it is being sold at, it's understandable. Regardless, there is a huge selection of food that you can choose from and the serving sizes are perfect so that you can get a little bit of everything.  The restaurant was exceptionally clean, the bathroom was unique. You would have to see it to understand what I mean. The restaurant had a very calm and cool ambiance that made it seem kind of young. I would definitely recommend this place solely on price, but maybe not so much on the quality of sushi."}
{"text":"I have not been a sushi lover in the past and went with my daughter and was hooked!  This is a wonderful restaurant, great prices and incredible variety.  Have been back a number of times.  Wait staff are friendly, not hovering and always attentive."}
{"text":"Service, price, and quantity of sushi are good. However, I gave 3 stars because of the bathroom...   I hope the owner fixes both two stalls (There are only 2 stalls anyway):  - Handicap Restroom stall lock: I met one regular customer and she informed me that it was broken awhile ago. Since this is a handicap stall, you cannot even hold a door because door is too far away... - Non Handicap Restroom stall toilet: On December, I went there twice and they did not clean the toilet and still out of service... When I went second time, out of service sign was gone but seems it was still out of service... I didn't even use the bathroom and came out..   After I ate and saw the bathroom and I did not feel comfortable. Bathroom can be dirty sometimes but I would not expect to see same dirty toilet in two weeks a row.."}
{"text":"Oh my God this place is terrible. The service is so bad here... So bad. They need more staff and know it. Maybe they want to save money by not hiring anyone else... Our sushi sat in the corner of the bar for a half hour before anyone brought it to us. The other half of our order remained on the bar until I went up and got it myself. Come on people. You can get much better service up the street, food isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Went during lunch time and even though there was a rush they brought our dishes out quickly and it was very fresh! Everything I had was great! I was so stuffed.  I'll have to come back on the weekend so I don't have to rush"}
{"text":"The \"all you can eat\" is pretty much a borderline scam at $13pp for lunch.  I won't be back"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience at the Akita Sushi Restaurant. Great customer service, my waiter flawlessly made sure I was taken care of and received everything in a timely manner. Its awesome knowing that the majority of there menu is available to choose from. Since I got there before 4:30 PM I received there special which is about a total of $15.   Anyways, Totally recommend the place, You'll definitely enjoy it and I know for sue I'm going there again.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Overall had a great sushi dinner. Can't complain about the all you can eat and the quality is quite good. The place could improve in it its organization with items coming to my table we didn't order and things we did order never being brought to the table side. Will definitely return as the food is good. Try the seafood salad."}
{"text":"The food is flat out terrible! Please don't subject yourselves to the torture of sitting in this restaurant."}
{"text":"All you can eat and good quality.  Went with a friend for his birthday and had a blast!  It's an all you can eat menu NOT a buffet.  I was pleasantly suprised to find that all the rolls are made fresh to order!  Great place I will be back as often as I can convince my lunch crew to go.  Happy hour specials and dinner look good too but haven't been at those times yet."}
{"text":"Saw this place had 9 violations with the health department. Was looking forward to going here, but I won't now."}
{"text":"A very good deal for the price. Lots of options and food tasty.  A good local place for a casual dinner.  Unlike other reviews, we did not experience any problems with the staff. Everyone friendly and making a good effort."}
{"text":"Been here twice now on business trips and it was a nice option for lunch. Decent prices and nice variety. Service was good and clean ambiance. Bathrooms are fancy with marble faucets. I call these type of sushi restaurants sushi trains, as I've had this style in San Francisco. You control the cost and select the variety you want, it's nice to have a lil of this and a lil of that."}
{"text":"I went to lunch here with a friend and their all you can eat special is so great and ends at 4:30 which was convenient for us. They are quick with your orders and have a large selection of items included with the all you can eat lunch. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Reviews are usually pretty accurate, it's a decent place but not the greatest you can get. It's neighbour, Sake sushi is better and has a similar menu with more options and easy ipad ordering for the pretty much the same price.  update:  I was here a few times during the summer but I was informed they have ipad ordering now, which is superrr great :) from what I remember being there, food is great and pretty fast and service is good too, it was all there, but menu didn't have a lot of pictures. I'd definitely love to try again!"}
{"text":"\"Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more\" - King Henry/Shakespeare  The word determination originates from the Latin word 'determinare', which describes an action of settlement or a decision to end. Determination has been described by many throughout history, such examples include: the epic journey of Odysseus and his return home from the long and treacherous Trojan War, the painstaking cycle of failures displayed by Tomas Edison to perfect and patent the lightbulb, or Sisyphus and his cyclic attempts to reach the top. Oppenheimer once said, \"Any man whose errors take ten years to correct is quite a man.\" Determination is an essential part of human philosophy which allows us to fix our mistakes for a better future.  Akita sushi absolutely fails to display the above sentiments. Akita was perfectly set up for a grand display of determination; their early days were glorious. Opening in 2007, they were one of the first of its kind. Woodbridge was blessed with the first all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant that served seemingly fresh sushi to unbeknown Woodbridge customers, whom barely had a taste of authentic sushi before. Its location attracted many high schoolers (including myself at the time) as well as newly sushi-subscribed food enthusiasts. But their glory days were soon stomped on by York Region Food Safety commission, who shut them down for their termite infestation. With this infestation, they could have come back with a grand display of rebirth and determination; they were the prodigal son who would return from his long absence. However, their attempt of rebirth was a display of failure, an aborted fetus rather than a prodigal son. After reopening, their sushi has become nothing but subpar. Their sushis are overly filled with rice, having a very small amount of fish in it. Their serving size of appetizers, side dishes, and hot plates are extremely small. The serving time is rushed; they will try to push bills before you are quite satisfied with your stomach. Their service is great, however, they are often understaffed.   Akita sushi has changed from the nostalgic place I once knew to a restaurant that serves slow and subpar sushi. Similar to the Oppenheimer quote above, perhaps we should wait until the end of 2017 to see if this place deserves a title as a sushi restaurant.  2/5"}
{"text":"I don't review often. This was very good ayce sushi, perhaps the best I have eaten. I had great service. The sushi was fresh and you did get more fish than any other ayce I have been to and that is many states as I travel a great deal. You will not go wrong."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here, especially about the health rating I dropped it a bit.  This is a simple place for cheap sushi on demand.   I liked that it was a kid friendly place and the food is available as soon as you sit down.  If you are starving, and want to eat now, this is a good option.   The prices are excellent.   I had dinner here with many many plates and it was around $30, then went to stingray on the weekend and the tab was $98.   You get what you pay for, but I will plan on being back.   Just hope they clean up back there on those violations."}
{"text":"Folks the value here is quanity not the quality.  The best food on the all you can eat menu is the non sushi items.  If your looking for good fish I recommend Sakana or Sushiholic."}
{"text":"Love this new place! Sashimi on the all you can eat menu is amazing! Great selection, small bites! Bonus- booths hold up to 8 people easily!!"}
{"text":"Tried the all you can eat lunch. Beware, they say they will charge you for leftovers so don't waste and don't plan on taking home. The sashimi was great, the Las Vegas roll was just ok. I have had better. The California rolls were normal. Good service , seems clean."}
{"text":"Fantastico! I've been to many Sushi AYCEs around town and I would have to say this one takes the cake. The price of 20$ for dinner time is unbeatable! Unlike most other AYCE Sushi restaurants, Akita allows unlimited Sashimi! I would have to say I've tasted slightly better quality sushi but with the great variety that Akita offers, I would still choose this place. The service was decent - good, sometimes we would have to wave a waitress over to take our next order, but everything came out relatively quickly. They were all friendly and overall I had a good time eating here. Will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"Worst sushi in town. You may as well get what you pay for and goto a real sushi restaurant unless you really like food poisoning."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi? Hmmmm...I'm always skeptical about the quality of AYCE places. Boy, was I wrong. I regret not discovering this place sooner. Why wasn't this in my life all these years in Arizona?   Typically other AYCE use low quality fish.  However, the fish here is high quality - fresh and flavorful.  The sashimi and nigiri are similar to the ones you order at any sushi restaurant. The boyfriend was raving about how good the squid and mackerel nigiri were. Presentation wise, this place gets an A+. All the rolls and hand rolls were beautifully displayed in front of our faces. If you're tired of eating sushi, they have a variety of appetizers, soup/salad, fried rice, teriyaki, and udon. I really enjoyed the cheese wonton and tempura, all fried to a crispy perfection. My friends had the seaweed salad, which was delicious. If you still have room for dessert, get the green tea ice cream. I just can't enough of anything that's green tea. Simply unbelievably! All of the above for only $20.99 per person.    The service was fast and efficient, especially for serving such a large party. I like the convenience of specifying the quantity of everything you want on a sheet of paper. There is no doubt in my mind that I will be returning."}
{"text":"Fresh fish at a great price. How can you go wrong?  One of my favorite places to eat when I'm in town on biz."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant friendly staff and the food is beyond amazing. My husband and I were looking for an all you can eat sushi restaurant and came upon this one. We will be back"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from out of state for work. I'm the only one in my family that likes sushi, so when I'm out and about by myself I like to take advantage and partake. I was NOT disappointed tonight.   My waitress was Liu Zhen, a very kind, soft spoken woman. She did a wonderful job. She was very attentive and friendly.   The food was phenomenal. I've always been a huge fan of eel (unagi) and they have several different options with eel involved. I highly recommend house special roll \"#121 Green Dragon\", eel and cucumber inside the roll topped with avocado and eel sauce. Delicious! If you take a look at the picture of the itemized receipt you can see everything I ate. It was all delicious and I... am... STUFFED!   If I make it out this way again someday I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi spot around, but I always feel terrible after. Don't go here if you're looking for good sushi. Go here if you're looking to eat as much as possible.  Their prices are relatively inexpensive. I recommend going for lunch if you go.   The best roll on the lunch menu is the gold roll. I dip everything in a side of eel sauce and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"such good sushi! hidden gem for sure!! after reading the reviews, we decided to try this place because all the other \"big name\" restaurants in the area were so over priced and usually americanized.   we did the all you can eat for $20 dinner - well worth it! every roll was delicious and so was the tempura. nothing was overly greasy which is good. we had the las vegas roll - best one... along with a few others, and a few \"specials\" - the mango tuna and the spicy girl. Needless to say, all the rolls were great.  We also had a small noodle bowl and a small salad.  We also ordered calamari tempura, fried bananas, green tea ice cream. The portions are not overly large, so we were okay even after eating all of this.   The service was good.. I'm not sure why people complained about service because to us it was fine.   I'd recommend coming here for sushi if you're hungry!"}
{"text":"For an AYCE place, Akita blew me out of the water ...  Not only does the interior surpass expectation, the sushi, service and price point were all very good!  $12 for lunch and $20 for dinner for good quality fish and AYCE- someone pinch me I'm dreaming!   I started with nigiri, typically I go with Sashimi to evaluate how good a sushi place is as it shows the quality of their product without the smoke and mirrors. The nigiri were portioned well, fresh fish/seafood and the rice was great. My biggest pet peeve with sushi is cold, over or undercooked sushi rice. The nigiri was on the money.  What I ordered: Nigiri: Tuna, Salmon, Red Snapper (Tai), Shrimp, Mackerel, Yellowtail, White Tuna, Red Clam, Masago, Tobiko   All were good, though I did not enjoy the Masago, Tobiko or Mackerel as they left more to be desired.  Rolls: Eel Avocado Roll & Tuna these were simple and yummy, came with 6 pieces  Fried: Shrimp Tempura, Calamari Ring and Fried Banana (with honey)  They do tempura very well here, crisp and light! Pass on the calamari, the shrimp is amazing! I did the fried bananas with green tea ice cream and found the bananas good, but a bit greasy and the green tea was too artificial and tasted overly floral.  I love the fact that there's no limit per order- as long as you don't waste. Also it's awesome that they do single item orders, so you can try a little bit of everything here. I'm excited to come back to try more of their appetizers, rolls and nigiri. The ramen they have here I would pass on as they come in small bowls in simple ramen broth and straight noodles."}
{"text":"Great price for lunch $11.99. Lunch menu goes till 430pm. Great options on the menu. Great service. All you can eat. Clean. Good parking. So many things we enjoyed about our visit here. Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"Well just don't bother!  This is a All You Can Eat Sushi Bar and each guest is given their own order form.  Sounds good right?  Well I'm not sure what she did with those forms but every so often she would bring something to the table and say \"yes someone ordered that\". Although none of us had ordered these strange names rolls we were all pretty straight forward; salmon, tuna, yellowtail and spicy tuna roll.....Well, even our drinks came out as though they were for someone else.  Sprite can out as lemonade.  It was totally frustrating and I think that they need to make sure that their waitresses can understand English.  They were 7 of us and not one of us were served what we ordered."}
{"text":"Finally an all-you-can-eat sushi place in Scottsdale. I could not wait to give this place a try.  Thanks YH!  Upon entering I was greeted by the host who did not seem very happy to see me but was cordial. I was alone and chose a seat at the sushi bar. I was expecting it to be crowded but I was actually the only person sitting at the bar.   After looking at some of the pictures posted on this site and trying to find some of them on the lunch menu, I realized that a lot of the nice rolls you see pictured are on the dinner menu.  That is completely understandable since the lunch price is a ridiculously low $11.99.   I ordered the Eel Avocado and Yoshinko rolls, as well as some standard nigiri tuna, white tuna, salmon and yellowtail. I eat quite a bit of sushi in quite a lot of restaurants and this is certainly standard quality, but  the value for the price is outstanding.  Please keep in mind what little you pay at this place when you come in and give a critical review about the presentation and quality.  The service was very good, the sushi chefs were pleasant and overall I like the atmosphere of this place. The location is conveniently a one minute drive off the 101 freeway.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying dinner. That price is a whopping $20.  Also looking forward to seeing what rolls are offered on that menu.    I would recommend raising the lunch price and offering a better assortment of rolls. And honestly I think dinner should probably be in the $25-$30 range.  Even then you could get \"sushi drunk\" and still only pay what you would typically pay for two full-sized rolls.  Food coma!   I just had some top-notch sushi and sashimi with a friend at Roka Akor.  It's nice to pay for that quality sometimes, but it's also nice to hit a place like Akita and go big for a small price!  Roka will run you 10-15 times the cost of Akita.   Be sure and tip well. I typically give 50% and take care of the chefs in AYCE places. Personally I feel guilty eating a ton of sushi and paying $25!    Give this place a try and enjoy!  Arigato!"}
{"text":"My friend Patrick and I eat at Akita Sushi regularly because there are very few places in Phoenix where you can dine-on a large variety of all-you-can-eat sushi for only $21 (if you go during lunch, the all-you-can-eat option is only $12). Sure, there are a ton of AYCE sushi restaurants, but they typically restrict you to a tiny menu that's primarily comprised of California rolls and things with cream cheese. Akita, on the other hand, offers nearly their entire menu to all-you-can-eat patrons. You can even order sashimi! Besides sushi, Patrick and I also order udon, tempura, yakatori and potstickers-all for $21. Of course, you have to finish the majority of what is on your plate (although they've allowed a roll or two to straggle behind before), but that's typically a given at any all-you-can-eat place.  The quality of the sushi is also surprisingly good. The fish actually tastes fresh, unlike the unjustifiably popular Sushi Brokers. It's not as high-quality as Hiro, but I've never hesitated to eat something on my plate. If anything, the rice sometimes lacks freshness, but never the fish. The service is friendly and refreshingly speedy, and Akita even offers two-for-one deals on their beers every single day! Combined with the fact that I've never had to wait more than ten minutes to be seated, I'd say that that Akita is a great spot for anyone needing a good sushi fix."}
{"text":"Didn't realize it was all u can eat.  Food was mediocre at best.   Edamame came late and was cold.  Rolls were small and forgettable.  Wasabi and ginger dried out.  Won't be coming back ."}
{"text":"Was great when it opened and then turned into complete crap.  Dont bother. Go to Sake instead."}
{"text":"Standard AYCE sushi. Service is fast and servers were nice.  Only complaint is that because my boyfriend and I went to eat late at night, the food did not taste fresh. Also, 10% gratituity was added onto the bill."}
{"text":"This place is affordable, I feel like I make money when I come here. Food is incredible.    This is still my favorite restaurant in Phoenix - unlimited sashimi and it's really good!  I come here with friends often and we love it."}
{"text":"Wow can't believe fish is this good for only $12! And in Phoenix of all places!"}
{"text":"All u can eat sushi for reasonable price, but I didn't want to stuff my face anymore once they brought the food. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Yuck. Unless you come exclusively for sashimi don't bother. They mix all the spicy tuna, salmon and other rolls with tons and tons of panko breadcrumbs before smooshing it onto the rolls. It's absolutely disgusting. I know it's all you can eat, but it says nothing about all you can keep down. I didn't make it to the bill before Ralph and I had a serious conversation in the restroom."}
{"text":"While in the area, I was in the mood for sushi so simply picked the closest place to where I was. This sushi place is an all you can eat establishment where you order what you'd like and they bring it to the table. I prefer this type of sushi place over a salad bar type of sushi place as the rolls are made fresh. Our server was just OK, sometimes we needed something like more drinks or napkins and we had to wait a bit till we saw him again. My rolls were good, the tempura type stuff was OK but my California roll had very hard pieces of avocado which were not quite ripe so I had to take them out individually in order to finish it.  Not a big deal really but I've never had to do that before. I would go back again if in the area. I will say the presentation of some rolls were quite pretty. (Update 6/2018) I've been back a few times, service is just OK, last time our server walked away while I was still talking asking a question. It wasn't even that busy. Overall you come here to eat a lot of sushi, that's it. It's just OK really. I prefer quality over quantity personally. Also, I ordered the veggie fried rice and got chicken and the person who delivered it just looked at me like he didn't understand what I was saying. I find this has happened a few times now. If you love sushi and want a lot of it, go here. If you prefer quality of service and food, try someplace else."}
{"text":"Sushi wasn't good at all...the appetizers were okay. Our server basically forgot about us and all of our glasses were dirty so we ended up drinking our beer straight out of the bottle. Our orders kept getting lost, wouldn't go there again"}
{"text":"It's okay....   Lunch is $12/13 and dinner is $20. I think it's worth it for lunch, but meh for dinner. It's for everything on the menu... Sushi, appetizers, fried rice, noodles, dessert.   You order appetizers, nigiri and sashimi  by the piece. Their specialty rolls were okay. Nothing was extraordinary. And there was eel sauce on many of them.   We tried the seafood ramen too. It was meh.   The staff was super friendly and were good at describing what was in the rolls. But def try to sell each one as really tasty lol. The waitress told me the sweet potato roll was so good it tasted like meat..... Hahhahaa. Um. It was ok, but def did not taste like meat...."}
{"text":"I'm very surprised that others have found joy in this place. I do know that my standards for sushi are high, but this was just disgusting. I literally could have gotten better sushi from the Frys by my house. Unlimited or not, the fish in the rolls was VERY obscure. Could barely see it or taste it. The only thing that makes this place remotely worth going to is the sashimi. I believe it is the pink dragon you can see in my pictures that actually has a decent chunk of fish! But that was all.. I will not be returning, instead I'll stick to Akai Hana or Oh Ya. I spend less, get full, and actually enjoy the food ."}
{"text":"This place has some bomb ass sushi. It's all you can eat which makes it worth it for the price! Definitely recommend this place to people who love sushi!"}
{"text":"12.99 for all you can eat lunch sounded like a great idea.  Unfortunately, you get what you pay for and here it was mostly rice. They make it very difficult to get to the fish.  We were very disappointed to hear that sashimi was not even on the menu.  A single serving of teriyaki salmon was 1 maybe 2 ounces at the most.  The rainbow roll had the thinnest slices of fish on it that I have ever seen. The fish in the spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls seemed to be heavily cut with a filler such as Panko. The TINY chunks of fish that we managed to find in the other rolls did not taste very fresh.  To add insult to injury we noticed two employees eating at one of the booths as we left.  They had two big plates of salmon and shrimp with NO rice!!!  What a kick in the groin. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Worse place I have been to in scottsdale. First of all, this is not a conveyor belt sushi place. You HAVE to order the all you can eat option which we were told was 9.95. Okay, different but great price. Well, we got our drinks and first round of our sushi order in good time but then never saw our server. When we FINALLY ordered our second round of what we wanted (35 minutes later...seriously) we didn't get half of what we ordered and it took another 20 minutes to get it. Fed up, we left to get our bill which was way higher than we were told ($20 a person) and when we told them about what happened, they just said they are short staffed (which I guess is the guests' fault) and took our card. We didn't have the option to pay only for the food we actually received, or pay what was deserved and fair. No offer to discount, come back again, anything.  AVOID. MOST MISERABLE PLACE IN SCOTTSDALE."}
{"text":"If the food wasn't so amazing, this place would be a one star. The service is terrible took me 20 minutes to get a waiter. He didn't even take our order he made us write them down ourselves. Only upside was the food"}
{"text":"The rating is for the quality of the food. This sushi here is hands down the worst sushi I ever had. The quality of the fish is horrific. All the rolls and nagiri came out dry and devoid of flavor. It was obviously old. Verrry old. The spicy salmon and spicy yellowtail was extremely dry and had the texture of sand. The salmon pieces were so old that it looks more grey than orange. Everything here is not fresh. Not even close! The miso soup was also terrible and also so salty that its impossible to finish it. Instead, I used it to hide some of the inedible sushi pieces I couldn't finish.   Ohhh.... and the water sucked too. Tasted like tap water with the chemical aftertaste.   One thing that WAS good though was the shrimp tempura. It was warm and pretty tasty.   I guess the reason for the high reviews is because it offers cheap AYCE. Prices for lunch AYCE rose to 12.99 from 11.99. They also don't have muscles anymore. If you want to eat alot of shitty food for cheap then this place is the place for you. Otherwise, any single roll at any other sushi restaurants is better than anything this place offers."}
{"text":"revolving sushi bar is a great concept! and it is not expensive! i love their shrimp tempura roll - the best i have so far! their seaweed salad is cheap and super good! my other favorite is their shrimp tempura udon with soup! this place just opened and we've been there 2x a week! I am going to keep on returning."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and the service is awesome. Family style for sure and the owner is very friendly. Great place to come for lunch"}
{"text":"Delicious AYCE sushi place! Fast service, GREAT selection, (they do unlimited nigiri!!!!!), and very good quality sushi. Came back here two days in a row.... Yum!"}
{"text":"Great service & you can not beat unlimited sushi for $20! The sushi chef came by our table & wanted to know what we thought about a new twist he made on the Las Vegas roll. Our server was extremely attentive & friendly, & even the manager came by to make sure everything was good.  This is definitely a hidden gem in Scottsdale. I would not expect this kind of service, nor quality, AND get this kind of a steal! Will definitely be a regular.  The Sweet Heart roll is delicious, & the classics are whats to be expected. Our Las Vegas roll with added miso sauce made this classic roll more savory & creamy than your regular old LV Roll.   I recommend the green tea ice cream to end the night :)"}
{"text":"$13.99 ACYE at lunch last week.  It was just o.k. for me.  Pros: * nigiri sushi were good.  we had the Hamachi tuna.  Cons: * avoid the pork & chicken cutlets.  So paper thin. * avoid the beef teriyaki & chicken teriyaki.  Same reason.  Paper thin. * thought we ordered the unagi avocado rolls but when the rolls arrived, didn't resemble unagi or taste like unagi.  As we were leaving, we looked at what other folks were eating - how come their food looked better than ours did?  Hubby & bro in law both had the tempura udon noodles.  Looked like the noodles came out of a package.  But they both enjoyed the udon.  Easy parking lot."}
{"text":"Found this place through fellow yelpers. After staying in the sun all day we were hungry and wanted all you can eat.  When we walked in there were ppl waiting. It took a couple of min to get the waitress to greet us. The family before us left because there were no tables. Lots of ppl In the dining room came in parties of 6 or more which left no space for smaller parties.    Luckily a table opened up for us. We ordered a bunch of specialty rolls. Including  XS roll,  Sweet heart roll, Las Vegas Roll, Amazing tuna, Manhattan roll, Angry dragon roll. Volcano roll   A lot of variations had imitation crab meat, mango, cream cheese, avocado or tempura  The Standouts has to be XS roll & Sweet heart roll   Las Vegas roll was a fried sushi with cream cheese and Volcano roll was similar with more sriracha decorations we wished we had gotten instead sashimi which was very fresh and was served with thick slices  Best sashimi: salmon, tuna           Nigiri: eel, salmon roe   Cons: There is a long wait for the sashimi and servers sometimes get orders mixed up, understaffed   Pros: fresh sashimi, price, generous portions. Ice cream"}
{"text":"I'm legit obsessed with this place.  You really can't go wrong with their lunch deal. Order whatever you want from the menu, as much as you want, and get it made fresh to order for $12. WORTHIT.  I've brought so many friends here and converted them for life.  Honestly, you can't go wrong. This place is my go-to when I'm trying to get a little sushi food coma ;)"}
{"text":"The most craptastic AYCE sushi I've ever had.  No wasabi dabbed in between the fish and rice. The supplied wasabi was in the form of a rigid block, dried out, and possibly stale. Even worse than the wasabi served at revolving sushi bars.  There was too much rice in the nigiri that created an imbalance in the flavors of fish and rice. I like sushi rice, but that's all I tasted in the nigiri, no matter what type of thin sliver of fish was slapped on top of the rice.  Really awful salmon and tuna, each piece had a firm and chewy flesh. Somewhat similar quality to the frozen fish served at Chinese buffets, they all lacked moisture. The yellowtail and white tuna were a little better and were the only fish worth repeating.  It was my first time being served warm mackerel from a sushi bar. Maybe it was cooked or toasted together with eel. Aside from having an odd slimy texture, the mackerel was flavorless for this type of fish.   The spicy yellowtail handroll was as dry as the Arizona desert. The ingredients wrapped inside the nori were salty and rough, and reminded me of eating dried shrimp.  Either the sushi chefs were uninformed or being cheap. They served a piece of kale with sashimi, and added a sliver of nori in between the ika and sushi rice. Have they ever eaten these with shiso leaf before? That would be a better choice of ingredient in my opinion.  To sum up my experience, the meal was a waste of calories."}
{"text":"This is a really good place to come for lunch when you're craving sushi! It's all you can eat for a set price and they have a lot of good rolls. I would recommend the manhattan and sweetheart roll"}
{"text":"When we moved to Arizona 8 months ago we searched for a great sushi place in The Valley. Akita sushi is incredible and is always consistently good quality. The all you can eat is fresh and we have never been disappointed. Don't hesitate to give Akita a try!"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot for lunch seeing as how they're all you can eat pricing scheme is $13 for lunch and $23 for dinner. Even at $23 that dinner is not bad all the fish that I tried including the salmon tuna yellowtail mackerel and escolar we're all fresh and tasty their rice was good the roles that I did try were very tasty. If you're looking for the top quality Sushi can get in the valley this isn't really a place for you, but it definitely is more than adequate and fresh and tasty and for the price it's hard to beat."}
{"text":"Wow!wow!wow! This place is AWESOME!!! Love the buy one get one sake for free;) The staff are really amazing like their sushi."}
{"text":"If I hadn't already been considering moving back to Arizona this place alone would have been enough to put the thought in my mind. My usual AYCE place in the Chicago suburbs is $5 more expensive with half the options.   Tempura: A- Miso Soup: B- Garden Salad: C (It wasn't actually bad, it just want the ginger dressing I've come to expect from places like this) Salmon Nigiri: B+ (too much rice but the fish was very fresh) Volcano Roll: A+ Sweet Potato Roll: A+ California Roll: B- Rainbow Roll: A  There is absolutely no beating the $12.99 price (lunch special) for the quality of sushi.   I would agree with the other reviewer who says stay away from the nigiri. There is a LOT of rice with a very small sliver of fish. But on the flip side of that coin, it's really really fresh and good.   And speaking of other reviewers, it is absolutely standard for an AYCE place to charge for anything you don't eat. That's how it works. So if you didn't know that already, consider this your heads up."}
{"text":"I thought the service was good; they cycle over different waiters so you dont wait too long plus the food comes out real quick. AYCE is not really my thing but we were really hungry and its def better than most other AYCE Ive had before. Fish was fresh and regular size portions. you order sashimi by the piece which is what I like so you dont end up over doing it. For some reason I thought the soy sauce was too salty but my friends thought it was ok maybe it was just me.   I can see some people liking the decor but it looks tacky to me. Doesnt really have that Japanese feel to it although it is a very clean place.   dish I enjoyed the most  - deep fried banana   It's out of the way for me so most likely wouldnt be coming back any time soon unless my friends that live near by invite me"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise! It's ayce lunch. $13.95 for adults and $6.99 for kids and ooh the food was good! We enjoyed everything we ordered especially the dry beef udon and all the sushi. Everyone was really friendly and funny enough, the kids thought the bathrooms were cool. I dropped a star because the restaurant is a bit dark. I think they should play music or something to improve the ambiance."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times before, and when we started, the food was good, and a good value.  Every time after that, it has consistently gotten worse.  The pieces of sushi keep getting smaller and smaller, and the food keeps tasting worse and worse.  We went there for dinner tonight and the food was terrible.  My husband ordered a salmon hand roll, and instead of putting actual pieces of salmon in it, there was some type of salmon paste.  It looked like sawdust, and tasted terrible.  The beef teriyaki was terrible.  My husband said that he would not even feed it to our dog.  The pieces of fish on the nigiri sushi were so thinly sliced that it was mostly rice.  The fried zucchini was not as crispy as it could have been, and the seaweed salad was warm.  For $21 a person, it was a total rip off for dismal food.  We will never go back there again.  We have been disappointed too many times by mediocre food that is not worth the price they charge, even if it is AYCE.  Go to a happy hour somewhere else with decent food.  Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi place I've ever been to! No limit on the specialty rolls or sashimi! Great Sake selection as well. Though, my favorite part has to be the waitresses, they are lively, funny, and great at their jobs! I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Warning! Never tried this place but saw all the good reviews so I thought \"what the heck let's give it a shot!\" The second I finished the second roll me and my significant other got extremely sick. It didn't feel quit like food poising but we were up all night sick as can be. The server we got at the bar was great though."}
{"text":"We like conveyor sushi because it is entertaining for our kids and encourages them to try new things.  This was a pleasant surprise because the quality of the food was high and the prices were still relatively low for North Scottsdale sushi.  The kids loved the interesting bathrooms!"}
{"text":"The sushi is thoroughly average. Nothing exciting. The service is cold and abrupt and it is far too expensive, in my opinion. That is especially true then their coupons are laughable. Why waste the paper to print a $2 off deal? We will gladly drive just a little farther for better and  warmer service."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurants that provides fresh seafood and even I reordered from the menu, the speed of food is still fast. Definitely would go again"}
{"text":"I personally really like this place. It really is all you can eat (on the stipulation that you finish everything on your plate of course). Also... Here's a big one (especially for me and anyone who knows I review based on this perspective), it is GREAT for vegetarians! There are many different kinds of sushi rolls you can get there (the avocado roll, avocado cucumber roll, sweet potato roll = ones I get), you can also get the spring rolls, miso soup (no fish stock or chicken broth), the veggie tempura, they have an udon dish. Basically, there are a lot of options you can get as a vegetarian, and there's also tons of options for your friends who might not follow that dietary preference! A perfect place for mixed dietary needs/preferences to get together and hang out!  I personally try and starve myself half the day before I come here so I can enjoy as much food as possible. It is good quality food and very enjoyable. I have not gotten sick here once! (Well, except for when I eat too much.) Their desserts are also very good! I like the mango ice cream!  I would recommend this to anyone! It is a place great for a date or great for groups! Either way, bring some company and eat some food!"}
{"text":"I've let shiny things take my money and then leave me with nothing but regret enough times to know better (see: arcade claw machine, trophy wife, etc.)   This is another trap. Don't look at the fancy conveyor belt, just run."}
{"text":"What if I told you that you can get all you can eat sushi for $12. And it is good quality sushi? Well.... it's true. Been here twice and both times I got awesome sushi and great service. I have had  tuna, salmon, tobiko, mackerel, yellowtail, an eel hand roll, a Philly roll, a Cali roll, a Vegas roll, and my all time favorite: White Tuna. Not too crazy over their California roll but other than that all the rolls were very good. Non-sushi wise they also have a very large menu included in the all you can eat of which I have tried the miso soup, calamari ring, cheese wonton, shrimp and yam tempura, pork cutlet, chicken teriyaki, the avocado salad and desert the green tea ice cream and deep fried bananas. This is definitely a place that I will be coming back to often."}
{"text":"Great prices. AYCE on a Sunday for 13.99 but no sashimi. The salmon was good quality and they have a diverse lunch menu.  Recommended for: cheap lunch sushi, hangover sushi"}
{"text":"I've been reading about Akita Sushi for the past few months and finally had an opportunity to take my son there last Saturday. It was a good experience and we enjoyed the variety, friendly service and $11.95 all you can eat menu for a weekend lunch. Appetizers were hot and freshly made to order,  so it took longer than. expected, but that was okay and understable since there wasn't an empty table there. A plus was that half of the tables were occupied by other Asian people. That's always a good sign when going into an Asian restaurant!  what I liked is that it was not a buffet with troughs of pre-made food. The menu had a large selection and you could order as much and as often as you like. Portions are small but that was ok, so you get a chance to sample more. Just be sure to not order more than you can eat because they can charge you for items you don't finish. When you get your bill, everything you ordered is itemized with a cost of $0.00 next to each dish you ordered.  If you don't eat it all, there will be a price other than $0 there for the dish you did not finish.    I was happy this wasn't just an all you can eat California roll place. There was a large variety of appetizers to choose from and good selection of sushi and rolls. I've had better but not for $12 and the sushi was not bad at all. The same selection  we had at any other sushi bar would have cost us $75 + easily. The drinks were an additional $1.99 each. I read in previous reviews that drinks were included for $11.95, so maybe this is a weekend thing or just a change in the pricing?   We will definitely be going back in the future."}
{"text":"Love the Concept here. Came here for lunch with some co workers and everything is made to order. There's a huge variety for sushi and non-sushi lovers alike. I don't eat raw fish but I had more than enough options for food and didn't have to feel like the odd man out. The staff was kind and gave recommendations and explained the menu. I plan to go back."}
{"text":"The servers in this restaurant are very rude and unkind. If the sever was unwilling to serve us if she thought we ordered more dishes than she expected. This restaurant is all-you-can-eat restaurant."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about an \"all you can eat sushi place\" but I was surprised to get good tasting sushi.  Staff is nice and friendly.  I will be back for sure !!!  Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I'll probably stop by here once every week or two. You simply can't beat the all-you-can eat lunch special price along with its selection. Everything was fresh, delicious and as I mentioned the selection is great. It doesn't just include sushi. Aside from that, the parking situation is ok (though expected) and the ambience is great and well decorated."}
{"text":"It's hard to find an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant that serves good sushi and provides good value (lunch = $12.99, dinner = $20.99).  Akita has a pretty extensive menu which also includes non-sushi and dessert dishes, perfect if you have that one friend that doesn't like sushi but wants to come out.  If you go for dinner (4:30 and later), the price is $20.99 and it includes AYCE sashimi which is almost impossible to find elsewhere!  The service is sometimes slow depending on how busy and who your server is but Brian (my favorite server) is exceptional!  I gave 4 stars based on sushi quality/value but I would give 5 stars on Brian's great service.  So let's call it a 4.5.  I'm big on value for my money and this place provides that.  Is it the best sushi in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area?  No.  Is it the best value in the area?  I believe it is!"}
{"text":"MADE TO ORDER SUSHI? AND ALL YOU CAN EAT?  This can't be right. But it's true!! and I can't wait to go back.  Its $11.99 for all you can eat lunch and $20 dollars for the dinner.  The website was a little confusing because it doesn't say anything about it being an all you can eat place, more so it shows things you can order for takeout, which are much more expensive then dining in.  When we got there i instantly ordered as much nigiri and I thought I could stomach (its one piece per order), They had really high quality salmon and tuna, to my surprise.  We then moved on to rolls, then more nigiri and I instantly regretted it since I was getting so full I thought i was going to burst. (why you were leggings or a dress to all you can eat places!) hahaha. Yet, we fought our way through 6 more pieces of nigiri. While we were looking at the menu for dessert, we read some small print stating that whatever you don't eat you have to pay for.  So i start panicking... is that extra $_ per roll?, per piece? per part of nigiri?! I have to admit I started just to eat the salmon off the tops of the rice balls so I could end up eating more fish and not being tricked by the rice.  After reading this, my fiancé and I had a hilarious time trying to hide left-over balls of rice into our napkins while the servers weren't looking.  I'm sure this was dramatic on our part because we ate everything else, but you can never be too careful!  This place does say that its a rotating sushi restaurant, but none were running when we were there, it was just made to order. So, just be mindful of how hungry you are, and hope that your brain isn't bigger than your stomach.   After reading all these amazing reviews I really wish I would of tried the dessert, but I guess there is always next time.   For ambiance and service, it was quite dark in there, but like I care to see other people, I just want to see enough to evaluate the food in front of my face.  The service was fabulous. Super attentive and always clearing off our plates and filling our water glasses.   I must admit, the dessert does have some excellent sushi. Shocking as that is."}
{"text":"Don't let the cheap exterior deter you. It is much nicer inside!   With any all you can eat place, there is an understandable compromise of quality, and most people going to the restaurant understand that. With Akita, the sushi was definitely good enough to come back. By no means are you getting world class rolls, but they are just as good as other places, and for only $12 for lunch, it's a steal.  The restaurant was clean, and the staff was very attentive.  If you don't want to spend $100 on incredible sushi, then you should definitely go to this place and eat to your hearts delight."}
{"text":"Never once has my cup been almost empty, they fill it before I can even ask for more! I'm never left waiting to have my order taken. Everyone who works there is super pleasant.    And the food of course, is delicious :)"}
{"text":"Xcellent sushi. Fresh and well prepared. Beautiful clean dining room. Sat at sushi bar,   Which was a little weird. The chefs do not talk to people at the bar. I ordered everything from the waitress. The menu is very limited, I like spicy...I asked for a roll with jalapeño and they didn't have any. If the chefs were more friendly I would have given Five Stars. Go here, you will love it, but don't sit at bar."}
{"text":"In terms of all you can eat sushi, you just can't beat the price here with this selection of items, and the quality will leave you satisfied for sure. For lunch you can select from appetizers, fried rice/udon, soups/salads, teriyaki, udon/soba, nigiri, sushi rolls, house special rolls and desert. The rainbow roll and the Manhattan roll are great and 8 pcs each, which is a lot of sushi. I actually wish those were smaller portions because I want to try everything!!! Overall solid place for lunch."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last night craving some good AYCE sushi. When we got there it seemed like a nice environment and was pretty full. The wait was only about 5-10 minutes and we were seated right away.   After ordering several rolls, my girlfriend and I were anxious on seeing how these would turn out. When we got them, they were a nice small portions compared to ones I've been too, which isn't so bad. You can order a bigger variety and still be able to eat them all.   But the rolls where I wanted to add crunchy tempura flakes were just awful. We couldn't immediately tell these flakes were hard and just straight up stale.   The Salmon sashimi ( on my second order) seemed slimy and just fishy. All the fried tempura (crab leg, mushroom, sweet potato) tasted pretty delightful.   I had a better time eating some of the appetizers than the actual house special rolls. All in all, it was a decent place for the price!"}
{"text":"It was really good and a lot to decide from the all you can eat menu. One thing about the menu I didn't like, it's not that detailed. Other than that it was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The service here was good.  I was a bit suspicious when dining at an AYCE sushi restaurant after working for a high end Sushi spot myself.  Let me tell you, the quality is good.  The portions are sliced very thin, but I'd rather have that than big pieces of poor quality.  Dined with my girlfriend and the price came out to just under $50.  Awesome price for a sushi dinner.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We love to go and concentrate on ordering off the Sushi menu only!  While the other selections are good, I prefer the sushi.  Definitely wallet friendly!"}
{"text":"I don't have much to say about this place, except for overpriced.  There is no way, it's necessary to spend $22 for an all-you-can-eat dinner.  At most places you can find a sushi box for $14-$16, which is more than satisfying, or an all-you-can-eat for less than $22.  Their sushi choices didn't blow me away.  They didn't have different items than what other places offer.  The ambiance is ok.  My friend and I got there early, around 5ish on a Monday and, of course, it was empty.  She said that it packs up.  It didn't pack up by the time we left around 630.  The green tea was uninspiring as well.  Nothing special I would recommend or revisit.  I've been to better sushi places for less than that."}
{"text":"Great service and the food is very delicious! Pretty decent quality for an all you can eat restaurant. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly staff, variety of choices, made fresh to order, relaxed atmosphere. I really like that appetizers and desserts are included in the all-you-can-eat. My only complaint is that sometimes you don't get everything you order. I think they accidentally give it to another table. Not sure. But overall, fantastic!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this place used to be my go-to near work for sushi. But, as time went on, the rolls got smaller and smaller and the fish actually seemed to get worse.  I never got sick from here but I'm glad I stopped going because I have since found similarly priced sushi that is light years ahead of this place."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. It made both my fiance and I sick. The sushi was not fresh. We went for lunch all you can eat and let me tell you were we disappointed. If you want to possibly get parasites or worse come here. Honestly awful sushi and I even tried because we were already eating there, their soup/ udon. There was burnt chewy meat in it. I ate it because if you order and dont eat it completely you are charged for what you leave behind!! My goodness this place is a zero star place. No class."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time recently, and got extreme food poisoning. I came home a few hours later, puking the entire night! It was the worst experience of my life, I don't think I can ever recommend it to anyone. The fish here is very dry and old, I'm surprised they haven't been cited for it.... yet."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a great sushi place near our new home and we finally found it! We were apprehensive at first when we pulled up since it was in a strip mall but we walked in and were pleasantly surprised! The decor is very nice and the booths were very cozy, perfect for a date night! The restaurant is all you can eat but it is at a very reasonable price! We tried various appetizers, rolls, desserts, etc and we Loved it! The only roll I would not highly recommend was the Vegas roll. The staff was very friendly and effort was obviously  with the presentation. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"If you like sushi and have been to quality sushi restaurants, this place is not for you. If you are into all you can eat, but don't care about taste, then please, visit this restaurant. The service was good, but the food overrides any positive points they might get for service. The rolls are chopped up fish and filler. I have no idea what the filler is, but we were unable to distinguish between the spicy salmon and spicy yellowtail rolls. The waiter did not even know which one was which!!! The nigiri have tiny, thin, tasteless pieces of fish on them. The sauces on the rolls are just sweet, no other flavor. And the seaweed salad had this thick, green slime on it, similar to snot."}
{"text":"The all you can eat sushi was pretty good.  What did cause concern for me was that we kept having issues with our sushi card that we filled out.  Let me explain:  1) We entered a quantity by a certain line item and it was not keyed into the system.  Had to ask again nearly 3-5 times on two items when not delivered.   2) We entered something on the sushi card and it did not match to what was brought out.  Happened a few times.    3) We entered something on the sushi card and it was not available in their stock.  Rather then coming back to us and reconfirming after that was noted, they just did not bring it out.  We only found out at the end when we started wondering where certain menu item was.    Otherwise, the quality of the sushi is good.  They need to start paying more attention to what is entered on the sushi card (both sides of the sushi card), and make sure they are entered.  They also need to let the customer know if there are any issues."}
{"text":"I love Akita sushi. The service is great. And the food is delicious. The prices are really reasonable. I live close by and I come here all the time. I really enjoy it."}
{"text":"Very good and extremely satisfied. Price point - perfect. Food was delicious and brought out extremely quickly. Would recommend to any sushi lover and I look forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"Sushi was good everything else was ambiguous.  Our first time there me and my girlfriend sat down ordered two drinks which is normal for a Friday night dinner. After we looked over the menu no prices were anywhere because this is all you can eat sushi so if you go don't expect much explanation the sushi was spectacular but they didn't explain anything which to me should be common sense from the hostess or host. Just some tips if they did that I would have been more inclined to go there again from here on out of so much. Just go to Ra if you are going to spend $70 on food anyways."}
{"text":"This place is hit-and-miss, but for $14 all-you-can-eat buffet, I really can't complain.  DO: -Order nigiri-- it's the best value you'll get for your dollar. We like the salmon and yellowtail. The tuna is tough. -Start small-- there's no official limit to how many orders you can put in and you want to make sure you like something because if you don't finish they'll charge you -Wear stretch pants -Bring a jacket (it's cold inside) -Save room for fried bananas and green tea ice cream DON't: -Order spicy tuna roll, calamari, or gyoza -Fill up on noodle and rice dishes-- you'll get the best value by ordering sushi."}
{"text":"Food was great tasing but later I didn't feel so good. I think they use msg in their food."}
{"text":"Great all you can eat menu!!! Not just sushi but the whole menu!! Only $12 for lunch and $20 for dinner!! The bathrooms are very cool!! Done up like a cave!! I will come here every time I'm in town!!"}
{"text":"Horrible atmosphere, everyone seems absolutely miserable to work there. Never bring all the food you order, make it seem like it's a huge chore when you inquire. Food isn't that great to boot. Would rather pay the same amount for better sushi and service somewhere else, even if it means going out of Bradford."}
{"text":"Excellent! We frequent all-you-can-eat sushi (That Joint) in Reno & Akita's quality, voices & service were superior. Great atmosphere - four of us are so much quality, 4 courses + wine for $110.  Wow!!! It was a xome-back spot for sure!!"}
{"text":"Disgusting restaurant! Never go back again. Make me all day terrible If someone read this comment just believe me."}
{"text":"For the price it has a great selection and you can't beat the price.  20 bucks for all that you can eat from not just a selection, but from the whole menu.  Not bad at all!.  The sushi chef and owner also came to our table to ask if we needed anything else that is service.  Now from the servers some are good and some are not.  The good thing is that you can wave down any of the server and they will be happy to help you out.    The best thing about this restaurant is that they you don't have to just have sushi or sashimi all that you can eat, but also have a wide selection of other items such as tempura, ramen, fried rice, and salads (squid, seaweed, or regular).    Conclusion, as for the distance from me, I would take the 40 min drive to go to this restaurant again and again,  I liked the personal attention from the owner (sushi chef)  They do have a reservation online that you can do and 20 buck for all that you can eat.  You can't beat that.  They only down side is that when it is busy you may have to wait to be seated, but that is expected.   The bathroom is awesome, which is weird to say.  Wait till you see it."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed Akita Sushi's all you can eat lunch. It was awesome! They do not cut any corners on the selection of food available on the all you can eat lunch menu and it is a great deal! We really enjoyed all of our food and the service couldn't be better."}
{"text":"The worst sushi I've ever had! And service?! Forget it! You will serve to yourself! We were ignored with anything we asked for! The menus were on the table the whole time and sushi were placed on top of it! Such a mess! Never again!"}
{"text":"I come here for their lunch special which is $12.99 for all you can eat. This continues to be a favorite for me because the price and the overall quality of the food. It's not buffet style which definitely classes it up. It really is a beautiful place, actually. Not cheap like you might expect. The bathrooms are incredible. I might sound crazy, but just see for yourself. They have a large variety of food to order from and they always serve it so quickly! Go in with an empty stomach, you'll definitely want to make room for everything! The Volcano roll is really neat and delicious, too! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I am typically not the biggest fan of buffets as I think quality tends to take a backseat to gluttonous quantity. Akita is a great exception. The sushi and sashimi taste pretty great, especially for Arizona. And the pricing is very competitive. Lunch is $12!! Hopefully that will discourage people from feeling obligated to gorge. Try it! Service is great too."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi was something I had to try, especially since the reviews were pretty good. Unfortunately this isn't a place I have to come back to.   Quality of food wasn't great but you definitely get a lot for your money. I didn't realize that appetizers, soup, salads (several different options), and dessert are also included in the $21/person fixed price, so that was a nice bonus. That being said, nothing was super flavorful or fresh tasting.   Family friendly environment and we were 1 of 3 families eating on a Friday night with kids. Server was attentive and nice. Downfall was the food wasn't amazing, it was just ok."}
{"text":"Food is really good... honestly very good... Service is spotty... often they'll bring you the wrong items.... but they're always cool when you tell them they brought the wrong thing... again, food is great..."}
{"text":"Lunch is all you can eat for $12.99 plus drink, let's you sample the menu.  Great deal for good sushi and Japanese food."}
{"text":"The All You Can Eat lunch is a great deal! $13.50 per person gets you a lot of choices. They have a lot of appetizers to choose from. The sushi choices were great as well. The dessert choices were okay, but I wish there were more options for that. I really like the aged tofu from the appetizers. The taste is subtle and not too heavy. I also like how they have seaweed salad as well. Their seaweed salad tastes fresh, not too fishy or sea-like taste. The sushi are tiny and cute. I definitely will be coming back here. Good food and good deal."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday from the recommendation from friends that have had their all you can eat for $11.99.  Big selection from appetizers to entrée to Ramen or Udon Noodles to Sushi to desserts.  All orders are small like tapas but you can order as many as you like.  It is good to order in small quantities so you know if it is something you really want or like and then go back and order in \"mass quantity\".  I started with the appetizer and got the tempera shrimp, deep fried scallops and gyoza. All 3 were prepared very well so I reordered in larger quantities.   Also ordered the Teriyaki Chicken and Teriyaki Salmon. Both were excellent so I asked for another order of each. Keep in mind all orders are small.  I also tried the shrimp tempura sushi which was also very good.  I ordered the seafood Ramen which comes in a very small bowl and was probably one of the least favorite dishes.  The best dish was the teriyaki salmon which had a good consistency while having that crispy edge.  The soda drinks were also endless.   That people waiting on us were very good however some of the dishes took some time where we could not remember whether we ordered them or not.   Now keep in mind the restaurant states any uneaten food will be charged on top of your regular buffet bill.  Overall I was impressed with the overall concept and $11.99 lunch price.  I look forward to returning to eat here again.  Arigato!!"}
{"text":"Tough review to write.  Food: 5 Stars Service: 1 Star  I came with a group of 11 for their all you can eat ($12) lunch. Yes, they knew we were coming. 2 hours and 30 minutes later we were finished.   Ok, the good first. The rolls were great. I had 3, which were the 3 listed on the \"Specials\" board, not on the menu. Everyone else really enjoyed their rolls too. There were no complaints on the quality of the food or the size of the portions.   Now for the not so good. They took our food orders (first round) at 12:30. I ordered a spring roll (appetizer) and 2 rolls. 45 minutes later I had nothing. Some people at the table were on their 2nd roll. The waitress had no idea who ordered what and would come to the head of the table with a roll and ask who's it was! Several of us ordered the same rolls and she gave it to whoever's hand went up first, even if they ordered last! A few minutes later I got my first roll. Still no Spring Roll. I asked again about my appetizer. 30 minutes later I got my 2nd roll and placed an order for my 3rd roll. Then after an hour and a half later, my Spring Roll came. Followed 15 minutes later by a 2nd Spring Roll. She must have put in another order when my first one never showed up. It took another half hour to get my 3rd roll. I dared not order dessert, however several people ordered the Fried Bananas, some with chocolate, and some with honey. Needless to say, they messed up on the orders so I ended up getting someone else's messed up order.   The problem wasn't the food, it's the management. They seem to have no system on making and delivering the orders. They should have know which seat the orders went too and not just stand at the head of the table and yell \"Who ordered.....\" Perhaps they do better with small parties. They had 3 sushi chefs preparing the rolls yet it seemed like a long time before plates were appearing on the counter to be delivered. A lot of other customers came and went while we were there.  Perhaps they were delaying our orders to accommodate the other patrons. The jury is still out on whether I'll be back. There are a lot of sushi places closer to my home that have top notch service."}
{"text":"Well like so many others I loved Akita sushi. We went for a late lunch today, a friday.   We were seated immediately and drink orders were taken. As soon as we sat down the little paper order sheets were presented. This is your ticket to sushi bliss. Just mark down the quantity of each item you want. Then the very attentive waitresses start bringing out plate after plate of fresh sushi goodness.  It was almost embarassing how many plates we had at our table.   We tries lots of different rolls and a few appetizers. I WILL be back to try more and hope to, someday, possibly try some of the hot food items like udon, teriyaki, Katsu style chicken and pork......    I am so full but already planning my next visit.  ENJOY, I DID!!!"}
{"text":"It's no longer a revolving sushi restaurant. Still serves ayce sushi though. This place should be like a last resort type if you plan on visiting, there are other places out there better than here.  Waiter gave me attitude when I asked for the green tea ice cream and fried banana to be served at the same time. He brought my ice cream then he said in broken English \"someone will bring out over there\". Finished my ice cream and had to order another ice cream to enjoy it with the bananas.  Decent enough for me to come back when my to go place for ayce sushi is closed or something."}
