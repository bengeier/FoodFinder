{"text":"This is an inexpensive dine-in and takeout, and I am a regular takeout guest. This place always pleases me, and makes grabbing vegetarian dishes for my girlfriend easy. The flavors are great, food is ready quickly, and the staff is always kind. I work as a flight attendant and this is my go to place for something quick to take with me to work, or to order on the way home from the airport. It doesn't pretend to be gourmet, but they excel at doing what they need to"}
{"text":"Myself and friends love this place! Family run, and great portions and food for the price. You gotta try the beef sub, coconut prawns, and coconut soup, soooo good!"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I are regulars at this little gem for so many reason. The atmosphere is lovely, the service is phenomenal and not to mention everything both of us have had to eat on the menu has surpassed all of our expectations of thai cuisine. 
Great addition to copper field corner!"}
{"text":"Food is tasty, service is always excellent and  decor is a1...great to support local restaurant."}
{"text":"Total surprise as to how great the place looked inside based on the outside.
My mom and I had the mango salad, which was totally divine. The dressing was not what you would expect but was totally perfect. Also the fresh rolls were good and big! The last one was #21, a vermicelli dish. The spring rolls in it were a bit greasy but other than that it was a good dish. And for the portions and quality the price was more than reasonable.
The service was lacking. We were the only ones in there at 1pm with three employees hanging around!?!
Overall enjoyed the food and atmosphere, just needed some help in the service department."}
{"text":"Great food and the BEST BUBBLE TEA!!

My Wife and I live in the SW and have frequently made the 25 minute drive just for this place. The staff are much more friendlier than some of the standoffishness that I have received from numerous other vietnamese restaurants. 

The food is great, the portion sizes are big, and the bubble tea actually tastes good and mixed. Some bubble teas I've had from other places used a cheap tasting powder that didn't fully dissolve or had rock-hard pearls. 

The only downside is the fact that it's a bistro and space is limited. Even so I've come as a group of 4 with no problem."}
{"text":"Horrible!  If I could give 0 stars I would!  Terrible tasting food (the microwave didn't stop running while our food was being prepared), food did not taste fresh and had a funny taste, and took forever to come out! (At dinner time no less). Avoid this place!  There never seems to be any people inside eating and that's usually a bad sign for a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great food, spring rolls are hand rolled with rice paper very hard to find. Service was good and friendly staff."}
{"text":"We have tried this place a few times and have yet to find a tasty dish. Although the staff is friendly we prefer other places in the area."}
{"text":"Good satay pho soup. Very expensive, quick takeout option. Good amount of beef in the noodle soup. First satay pho noodle soup that I have gotten to go that was packaged with the beef already mixed with the broth, noodles etc."}
{"text":"Although with a friendly service, this place does not serve very appetizing food. The food are not fresh. Their lemongrass chicken vermecelli seemed like it was cooked a few days earlier and was reheated to serve. The same thing with the fish sauce."}
{"text":"Sorry, this is not good Vietnamese food. We ordered 6 dishes and 2 appetizers. Food was between terrible and mediocre. Chicken rice went to the garbage."}
{"text":"4 solid stars!
We are never this far south but we had some errands to run in the area and a friend who does live around there recommended it to us.
It was not very busy on a Thurs evening - this is the type of place where you just walk in and seat yourself. Very casual but after speaking with the owners it is not so relaxed that you do not feel like a valued customer. 
This is a husband and wife team running this restaurant, they are very sweet.
The wife takes your food and drink order. The husband will come out of the kitchen and bring you a set of chopsticks and then later serve you your food with a smile.
We ordered some delicious tea and enjoyed sitting at the only high top at the window. Parking in the lot is a breeze. The washroom was spotless.
The food was made with a lot of love - hubby got the Phanaeng Curry with chicken (mild spice) and I got the hottest dish they make - the Green Curry with shrimp. If you want it even hotter than how it is served,  just ask for added chili peppers in the dish. If you adverse to red peppers, this may not be a good dish for you. There was a lot of them, but other veggies as well. I counted my shrimp , there were 10! They were surprisingly lightly breaded and I liked the texture! The shrimp were a good size and the chicken in the other dish was perfectly tender. $10 per dish, not bad at all!
Portions were very good, (loved the white rice too) and  we left comfortably satisfied with that warm feeling that homemade curry gives you on a cold winter day. 
I recommend this place and if in the area I would like to come back and try the Pad Thai (still on the the hunt for the best in Calgary - so far Thai Bistro wins). It is said to be their most popular dish (of course) and I will say there were a lot of people coming in for take out. It did not take away from our service but I would say that if you are in a rush, this may not be the place for you. Like I mentioned, it is a very relaxed atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Mango salad n Pad Thai were very tasty and in big portion! Must try! Cute decor and tables!"}
{"text":"This is pretty far SE to find a good Vietnamese restaurant, so I wasn't expecting much. I stopped in at a strange time (thus, it was quite dead and so I cannot qualify the other comments mentioning slow service).  I ordered a couple subs, which admittedly took a fairly long time, relatively, to put together. Maybe a little bit of growing pains here, as the staff learns how to speed things up via good prep work.

However, I found the sate beef sub pretty tasty. Nice picked carrots, very fresh bun, and a decent sauce. Nothing to write home about. However, it was only $5. So with the price in mind, I found it to be very good value and worthy of stopping in. I'd order ahead, as mentioned.

But Viet places are a dime a dozen in Calgary, and the market is very competitive. As a consumer, you've got your pick. Now, in the Mckenzie/Douglasdale/Copperfield area we have three (more?) choices.

For Vietnamese in the deep southeast, consider Saigon Royal instead."}
{"text":"It was empty but I was alone and being the only one in there didn't bother me in the least!   There food was amazing!  They gave me some new pointers on how to maximize the flavour of their foods!  I am impressed and since I live close I will be returning.  

10 months later:
New chairs nice new colours.   This place has upgraded it self and it looks great.   I am always impressed by their food.   I will return many more times to come."}
{"text":"This little bistro is in a strip mall attached to a Starbucks and across from a school in a cozy neighbourhood in Calgary. They have delivery, pick up or stay in options. 
Being so quaint and local the owner is very welcoming and will make any adjustments to any meal necessary. 
Although just a few tables inside and no spot for a patio option I highly recommend their Vietnamese subs as a wonderful, fast but healthy meal."}
{"text":"We ordered two mains, two appetizers and a soup. Everything we ordered was wasted. Nothing tasted good enough to eat. We ended up throwing everything away and cooked dinner instead. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Stay away. I got their lemongrass chicken, spring roll vermicelli and it was truly disgusting. Chicken had zero lemongrass flavour and the whole dish was just gross, no love went into making it, it was like high school cafeteria food but overpriced. Honestly, the dish didn't look anything like the photo and didn't taste anything like the order... When I went to try to switch my dish, the owner talked back to me and refused to give me a new dish or refund. Very poor customer service. By the looks of it, I'm not the only one disappointed with the food or the service."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. 
About a year ago we walked in and sat ourselves down... a waitress casually walked over and gave us a menu.  After sitting around for ten minutes (not exaggeration) i finally walked over to the front desk/cash register and found the \"crew\" sitting at a table in the cooking area eating... we walked out.
Tonight we decided to order from there again and ended up throwing out our food.
It was a letdown... though considering our first encounter it shouldn't have been. 
Fool me once shame on you... Fool me twice... fuck this disgusting place. I advise anyone to eat anywhere else. 
My lady is throwing up the rubbery chicken we had right now... well... a couple minutes ago...
What I'm saying is... don't eat here. It's fucking disgusting."}
{"text":"Not very many viet restaurants in south calgary, so when I was craving for it we tried it here. There was a funny stale smell them minute we walked in (my neighbors had warned me not to go here and had walked straight out due to the smell).  Place was small but decent inside, and we liked how they have a separate take-out section.  However sit-down service was okay, and even though food was quick to be delivered it was greasy and we couldn't even finish our meals.  Do not get the springrolls... it's $4-$5 for 2 greasy vegetarian rolls.

Slightly more expensive for a viet restaurant (which we would've accepted given the limited # of restaurants down south) but not worth the food quality."}
{"text":"We loved it! First time here the food was fantastic the decour is very nice it's very clean and very friendly. We will be back, it's our new regular."}
{"text":"Service is great, food is not. Extremely disappointed! What Vietnamese restaurant gives you unseasoned fish sauce? They didn't even have garlic chili for me to add into the plain fish sauce. They gave me a whole raw chili instead. The chicken in all our dishes were over cooked and bland. The portions and presentations were not impressive either. It is actually my second time visiting, as the first time was not too shabby. I had the pho. It was not amazing but it still satisfied my pho craving. Decided to satisfy my bun craving this time.. Major fail. Will not be returning unfortunately :("}
{"text":"This is a cute little family run business in the suburbs. Prices are great for the quality and quantity of food you get. Most people come in for take out here, so there usually aren't a lot of people sitting in the restaurant. I came in to order take out for 2 on a Friday night and waited about 10-15 minutes for our order. I have actually sat in the restaurant and had lunch here and found it quite relaxing. Good place to hang out and eat while checking your email or surf the internet. You can usually get free wi-fi from the Starbucks next door too."}
{"text":"Primarily a take-out place, there is a small restaurant as well.  

The cost, quality of food and portion sizes are fantastic at Viet Thai Bistro.  
Call ahead and pick up an order without waiting.   

The service on the restaurant side was decent and worth waiting a little longer."}

We live in this area so we eagerly awaited the opening of a Pho shop in our neck of the woods.  This place is in the same little plaza that the Starbucks is in so parking is ample and free.  The dining area is small with nice decor appropriate to the theme and on the day we went, it was relatively clean.  Unfortunately, that's the end of the good news.

Its pretty clear that the staff here have never run a real restaurant before.  There's no sense of order and efficiency.  When we sat down, we were the only people ordering and the only other table was packing up and leaving at the end of their meal.  Given this and the quick prep nature of Pho, we expected good things.  By the time we ordered drinks, a few other people started to come in to order take out or take tables.  10 mins after we ordered drinks, my tea hadn't yet arrived. 35 mins after we ordered, the food hadn't showed up.  Some take out orderes were getting done.  When we finally got someone's attention to find out what happened to our food, it became apparent that someone had lost our order.  Sadly, our waitress had been so busy serving the take out people that she didn't even know we never got our food.  We ended up leaving before any food came.  

Bottom line, we were there for more than 45 mins and left having just gotten tea.  UNACCEPTABLE.  If you're in the mood for Pho, make the trip up to 130 Ave SE or better yet, go to one of the MANY good Pho places in town."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and have noticed that this went from a great little bistro to a slow and not so good bistro.

We ordered take out the other day and it was terrible. Over cooked and burnt. My spring rolls were visibly burnt and the chicken so over cooked and dry it was inedible. We had ordered lunch around 2 in the afternoon so the place wasn't busy at all so we don't know what took so long. I am so disappointed this used to fairly good and has just gone down hill. I will not be going back again!"}
{"text":"Good quality food with good ingredients but this is simply not Thai food. Ordered four Thai dishes and they were all way off, sadly. Generally bland and missing key flavours. I may try their Chinese dishes if we attempt this again but will keep looking for Thai."}
{"text":"This place is great. Food and service is fantastic. Everything is made fresh and they are able to make the necessary changes to facilitate dietary needs, gluten free, vegetarian, vegan. 
They even marked out a menu for us with all the dishes that can be modified. 
Food is delicious but you will needs to bring your own gluten free soy sauce if you are gluten free!"}
{"text":"Just finished out first and last order from this place.  Both my wife and I love any coconut Thai curry soup.  The one from this restaurant (theoretically) comes with chicken!  I've attached a photo of the soup.  It's broth, not coconut milk.  They should rename the soup \"broth with a couple of pieces of chicken\".  Really the least flavourful Thai dish I've ever had.  I can't believe they charge $10 for water, some chicken stock, and a couple of pieces of chicken.

We also got the fresh salad rolls, which were pretty standard-tasting, so that was actually the highlight of our order.

Too bad-- I'm still looking for a good Thai place in southern Calgary."}
{"text":"If you like bland cold food this is the place for you.  My best friend said skip it but I had to try, why didn't I listen.  I ordered the lemongrass chicken vermicelli and there was NO flavour.  The sauce they give on the side, did not have a spec of spice.  The chicken was cold and bland.  There was no green onion, basil or cilantro, did I say bland.  Save your money and don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Love their food, but seriously who shuts their business down multiple times per year for weeks at a time. I think tonite was the last time trying to support their business obviously they don't need ours."}
