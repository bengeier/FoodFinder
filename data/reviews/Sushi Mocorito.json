{"text":"Order mocorito roll the rice was to sagy had no flavor at all definitely not coming back"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and the food was amazing. The customer service could have been better. We ate there so they brought us chips and salsa the salsa was really good but the chips they served us were crumbs. The wait time wasn't as bad as expected. Which was a plus since we were starving. I will definately be going back the food is worth it."}
{"text":"My brother kept talking about this place, finally brought us some home & we gobbled it up! It is a food truck on 35ave & van buren... I little sketch I thought but... So worth it!!!   The sushi; cielo, mar, y tierra is a great combo of shrimp, carne asada, & chicken. I have to say it's Good!!"}
{"text":"Muy mal servicio de la mesera, grosera, no tiene amabilidad en tratar a los clientes,  le pides algo (popotes, chips, q tardoooooo muchoooo en llevarlos) y se enoja....muy mala experiencia.  A lo q se refiere a la comida riquisima, lastima del pesimo personal.   Un cliente menos!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place puts a Mexican twist in their sushi. At first I was hesitant walking in. I stared at the menu for a couple of minutes and when the waiter came to take our order. I asked her some questions on what some on the items were. She asked me if it was our first time, I said yes. She was then more the helpful explaining to us the menu and what's most popular. She was friendly, took her time and was not in a rush. I found out a lot of their rolls have shrimp and I am allergic. I told the waiter that I was allergic and she said no problem we will custom make it and they were even courteous enough to replace it with crab meat. That was a huge plus for me. She didn't hesitate to say \"well we can't do that OR let me ask the chef if we can do that for you\". It was great, made me happy. So we ordered the big family plate for 2 and we waited.   When the food came out to our table, my eyes grew big. It was a huge plate of about 4 huge rolls and some had bacon on top and they all looked so good! I was ready to dig in! They first bite was delicious it had such great flavor. I don't know wether they put tons of melted cheese on top but some rolls did have carne asada in them! It was a great combination of flavors. It was fun exploring this new sushi style.   Great environment and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi, tried the guamuchilito. Love that it's not full of just rice like other places I've tried."}
{"text":"Food is always on point and very good but service if terrible. We tend to come often but service never improves. I will actually say that service was bad when they open and it's gotten worse as time passes."}
{"text":"This place has the best sushi I've ever tried. My favorite rolls are phoeniquera, llegadora and crunchy. Guamuchilito is also good. You have to try their papas arremangadas they're delicious. If you go in on Wednesday they have the special that you buy 2 and get one free. Their party trays are delicious and inexpensive."}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service!! You walk in no one greets you, you sit down literally 20 minutes passed before waitress came another  40 minutes to get served  there was only 3 people in restaurant rude customer service Will Not Be coming here again..."}
{"text":"I'm always down to try a new sushi spot, but definitely made a mistake saying yes to this place. We ordered the Sushi Mocorito, Crab Roll, and Aguachile de Camarón and neither of those three plates satisfied the taste buds. Instead, I got a severely upset stomach. As soon as I took a bite from the Sushi Mocorito I was immediately put off by how soggy the rice was. Plus, the roll kept falling apart because it was soggy and way too big to eat in one bite. I also don't think they took into consideration the balance of flavors because you could really taste the Philadelphia cream cheese and store bought imitation crab. We were so disappointed at the first roll we didn't even touch the second roll. We then decided to move onto the Aguachile de Camarón. I've had aguachiles before and they're a good balance of spicy and lemon zest, but this plate didn't have that balance. It was too spicy to eat comfortably. No extra avocado or ketchup could tame the taste.  Customer service was also lacking. There was no greeting when we walked in. Also, we waited a few minutes only to grab our own menus to which the server finally saw us and said we could sit anywhere. From that moment on, she acted as if she was annoyed to see us there (mind you, we were the only customers dining in). Once we paid (which, in hindsight, we really shouldn't have), she hovered over the table the whole time we were signing the receipts as in literally waiting to see what we would put down as tip. If you're a true sushi aficionado, I wouldn't recommend stopping by here. I left the restaurant only to immediately feel a wave of nausea, stomach cramps, and diarrhea for the rest of the evening."}
{"text":"Food was okay,rice was soggy. Service wasn't so great servers didn't look too happy.We said thankyou many times but never got a reply of \"you're welcome\" or smile at least....Wish the service a little more courteous.."}
{"text":"I'm really rusty on my Spanish so it's really hard to order but after looking at all the pictures and Local helping me out we ordered a couple different things burritos are gnarly huge and super delicious tried a couple tacos that were fresh with amazing ingredients when we tried the Sushi it was out of this world! , I saw several people coming up for takeout orders that had huge platters of sushi and it's so reasonably priced totally will be coming back cannot wait"}
{"text":"Great Place for Mexican Style Sushi! Love the food and the staff is always friendly. I definitely recommend you try them out."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch after hearing good things. Was surprised to find it a food truck and not a an actual restaurant. Never one to shy away from a new dining experience we parked and walked up. Cash only and menu is in Spanish, well that limits both the purchase and decision making. The gentleman there offered a few suggestions and we went with one of the rolls, a couple carne asada tacos, a couple el pastor tacos and two bottled sangrias.  Tacos were good, roll was okay. I'll give them another try at the sit down location on Glendale before passing final judgement but today was good not great."}
