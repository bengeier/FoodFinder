{"text":"A colleague and I decided to try this Thai restaurant for lunch as the price was right ($5.95) and it included a free drink (I love the Thai iced tea and the lemonade). 

The dishes are very good. I especially like the yellow curry. The flavor is reminiscent of the Thai food I would eat during a 3 year stay in Malaysia. Thai Paradise offers the lunch specials with the standard chicken, pork, beef and shrimp (add $1). They are one of the few Thai restaurants that also offer a seafood option (add $2), which I really enjoy from time to time. They also know the meaning of Thai HOT. Most Thai restaurants I frequent do medium to hot after requesting Thai HOT. I have tried just about all of the lunch offerings. I love the curries. The Pad See-ew is also excellent.  The Satay is great. Spicy Basil is good. The only lunch item that I wouldn't order again is the Garlic. It is really just a broth with meat in it ... kind of a spicy soup. I think it needs some vegetables. Eggplant would be nice. I need to go for dinner so I can try some of their other curry dishes.

The owners are exceptionally nice and gracious. They are very attentive to all of the customers. I go there at least once/week. The food is always fresh (they personally go to the grocery store each day) and the quality is very consistent. I highly recommend Thai Paradise.

(EDIT)
Since my review, Thai Paradise has changed the Garlic dish. They have changed it to a dry curry. This has now become one of my favorite dishes. The owners at TP aim to please!"}
{"text":"Food is good and tastes authentic. The entire restaurant seems to be ran by one person acting as the chef and the waiter. Usually when we go, it's pretty quiet so service isn't much of an issue. I usually order their spicy chicken basil with extra sauce and haven't ordered anything different since. Definitely worth your time as long as you don't mind slightly slower waiting times."}
{"text":"I've tried several Thai places in the Valley but this is my favorite. Best appetizer is the butterfly shrimp. Best fried rice: Pineapple Fried Rice (fried rice w/yellow curry powder, chicken, shrimp, pineapple, raisin, and cashew nut). This item is about $11-12 and is just a bit expensive considering you only get two shrimp in a big box. Nevertheless, the portion size is generous.  We usually order a curry for the main course. The yellow curry is my favorite. MOST of the time when I've requested a certain heat level, it's been correct. But there have been rare occasions where it was made too hot. I like to taste the different spices, not being overwhelmed by the heat. Besides those things, it's still the best. Support small businesses!"}
{"text":"i tried to order deliver, and they yelled at me...I stated to place a carry out order and they hung up."}
{"text":"If you get it to go is the best way .. Food is very good.. Luckily my girl friend ordered for pick up and when we got there to pick up, there was only one older guy who doing everything including cooking .. We were little shock but after we tasted the food , it was great. Drunken noodle and beef salad was great"}
{"text":"Walked in a and immediately hit by semi rancid smell... okay, maybe it's just an old building... saw only two tables waiting for food so I figured shouldn't be long for service since both obviously already had drinks and soup bowls... 15 minutes later I gave up.  I was looking forward to some Thai food, but now that I've blown half of my lunch break driving and waiting, I guess I'll enjoy a bag of chips from circle k...ugh.

May be good food but if I can't get service why bother walking in.  Also, someone needs to do a deep clean and clear up the funky smell."}
{"text":"Better than CHARS. Better than Thai Rama. Authentic Thai that makes me dream of the green curry, TOM HUM, and Crab fried rice (REAL CRAB). The restaurant is clean and the owner is very warm and inviting. I travel in from Maricopa, Az  when I get a craving, and make it a must stop whenever I'm in Chandler. You want real Thai food? This is the place."}
{"text":"Great food ..... Family owned and very friendly.  We order the Tom Yum and Tom Kha soups. Delicious!!  I'd definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place was GREAT! The owner was very friendly and the food was delicious. You can't go wrong here. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is my very first time here. I ordered the padThai which I shared with a good friend of mine. She had also ordered one of their yummy spicy redCurry sooo DELICIOUS!  In fact it was the BEST overall THAI restaurant experience I've had this year for anywhere I've eaten or in ARIZONA."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for lunch on Saturday afternoon . It is a wonderful experience for us. The boss provided hometown style food for us. Undoubtedly, it was so yummy!! I really like the spicy vegetable entree. Ahhh delicious! The service was good. The price is also cheap because the boss gave us big portions!! l will comeback next time!!"}
{"text":"AWESOME food! The yellow curry chicken (medium) and Thai Basil beef are nothing short of make your mouth drool delicious! The owner is pretty fantastic as well. We order to go and he has everything ready within 10 minutes. It's our go to on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"Where to start?? The food is fabulous!!! The customer service is beyond gracious. I loved how well the owner treated us. We need to come back! The aura is calm and he runs an honest business."}
{"text":"Thai Paradise is incredible!!! I was shocked at how good it was since it's a tiny little place in a strip-mall, (never judge a book by its cover or a restaurant by its less than fancy ambiance).  The service was friendly, capable, and fast which makes this a great place for lunch, not to mention the lunch specials come with soup.  The Saytay Chicken was tender and flavorful, (though I have had better peanut sauce) and the Pad See-Ew was the best I've had in all of Phoenix!!!!!!!!! Fast service, delicious food, and a great price, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"found this place looking for something to eat  thai ice tea  very good food as well tum yum soup is the option if you like spicy and full of flavor !!! the only complaint was the service :( (im a server so i know about it ) we were 1of the only 2 tables at the place and the service should've e been  better  otherwise i'll be back !!!"}
{"text":"The place doesn't look like much but the food was Amazing and full of so much flavor.  The portion sizes were very generous and priced very good.  The women who I assume is the owner was very pleasant and helpful.  GOT TO give it a try, we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We drove nearly 25 miles to try this Thai restaurant based upon Yelp reviews and were not disappointed. Since it was a Saturday, the weekday lunch special was unavailable, but the price was only $2 more. My wife had yellow curry and I the Panang curry. Both were delicious and quite large coming with a separate container of Thai Jasmine rice rather than the customary inverted cup amount. The ingredients were high quality, artfully prepared and spiced according to our stated preferences (medium and Thai hot respectfully). Although I was warned about the spice level, I found the \"Thai hot\" to require some fortification from the condiments tray to bring it up to my hothead liking. One of the better Thai restaurants in the Phoenix metro area in my opinion."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai! Started with the Tom Ka soup which had plenty of potato, carrots, noodles and the perfect amount of lemon. My chicken dish was large and a perfect spicy level for my liking (3 on a scale of 4). They were extremely tentative to vegetarian needs as well. This is absolutely going to be a new \"regular\" place!"}
{"text":"I just recently moved to the area and really found a \"Jewell\" of a restaurant. Love the Pad Thai, Spicy Basil, and for Lent, try the Catfish Pad Ped. He does Thai hot Perfect."}
{"text":"First of all, there was a bug in my food. One of those annoying little gnats that show up in the summer. The waitress was nice enough and gave me a new bowl and didn't charge us for that entree, but my appetite was ruined. 

In addition, the whole place smelled like fish. I mean it really smelled like fish. 

And finally, the food really wasn't very good. I normally can't get enough at Thai places and here the food was just meh. We took our leftovers home, but only ate them so they wouldn't go to waste. 

Maybe it's better other days, but we certainly won't go back to see.

** I just want to add that although they advertise halal, they have many pork dishes which is more than a little concerning."}
{"text":"New to the area, drove around and stumbled upon this restaurant. Not many patrons, but  it looked promising. The smell was less desirable but comparable to an Asian restaurant you would find in Southeast Asia. I had the yellow curry, sweeter, but tasty. I would come back again. Reminded me if the red curry I ate in Cambodia."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Thai food restaurant in Chandler. Way better than Thai Rama or Latitude 8.

The chicken larb is awesome and so flavorful. My usual is the pad thai, which is excellent here. I always have to ask for extra lime at other places but their pad Thai already has tons of lime flavor. 

Check it out! I don't want this place to go out of business!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Thai tea that was mainly 95% ice. Once I finished my drink, the server took the cup. He then returned with \"water\" which was literally the same Thai tea cup with added tap. It was the most disgusting thing ever. Never going back."}
{"text":"This is my new go-to Thai place! The service was wonderful- there was only one other table there at the time, but our food came out super fast and the guy there was very attentive with water refills, the check, etc. 

The Thai iced tea was incredible, and only $2 for a big glass. My boyfriend and I got chicken and tofu pad thai, which was equally amazing. We got the entree version, which came with more than enough to fill us up then plus a meal later. The lunch specials looked like a great deal but we were there on a holiday when they weren't available.

This place isn't anything fancy, but it's very clean, and it's got great food and good service. Definitely will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly owner and I like the fact that it's not too crowded or loud. It's usually pretty quiet in there which I actually prefer for my dining experiences."}
{"text":"Soooooo good! Excellent food plus judge Judy on the tv ;-) The garlic chicken was freaking great and the beef pad see-ew also excellent. And the Thai iced coffee is delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is some of the better Thai you can find in the valley. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is due to the constant short staffing. If you dine in you may be waiting a while but the food is worth it. The owner has always been very courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch! There's only one other customer here.  The guy at the cashier appear to also be the boss boy, the cook, amongst other things he was doing.  Lunch appears to be pre-made and gets reheated once ordered.  Myself and the other customer ordered two completely different dishes and the cashier/cook/bossboy disappeared for what seemed to be the quickest 5 mins ever and came back with both dishes.  Suspicious much? Mine was super salty instead of the extra spiciness that I requested.  No I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food since then ambiance and location is not impressive at all. We had Crab Rangoons, Pad Thai, Panang curry and sweet n spicy Fish. I thought the fish was a bit soggy and could be more crisp but the sause was great. Overall, I think I will go back since it is a minute away from where I live. They also deliver within a couple of miles for a delivery charge of $1.50."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool for a night when you just want to grab a quick bite to eat. It is definitely not a beautiful restaurant by any means and would not make for a romantic date spot. 

HOWEVER the food is really good. The Pad Thai and the Pad See Ew are my favorites there. I like how there is crushed peanuts on top of the Pad Thai here. Not every place does that which is a shame because I feel like it makes a huge difference with that dish. 

I was very impressed with the man who always serves us there, who I am assuming is the Owner. He is typically the only person working there. He takes the orders, cooks the food, serves the tables, and cleans up after. All the while my beverage is always full. Just amazing service there. I am happy to support local businesses like that who really take care of their guests and put out quality food as well!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the owners are welcoming and almost know exactly what I want :) The food is delicious, If you tell the owner what type of good you like, whether spicy or sweet, they will have multiple recommendations to fit you're taste buds!! Their Thai Tea is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Have to update my review to be clear about the service and the place. 

Again, food is great! The issue is that they are almost always understaffed and the building itself is not very nice. It use to not bother me as much, but now it is ensuring that I am eating here less often. When the wife and I decide to order takeout chances are we will still call this place, but when we want to sit down somewhere and have dinner this will not be on our list."}
{"text":"Ever since I moved to Chandler, my husband has commented on how unhappy I look after meals.. and I always reply with the same complaint-- I'm unhappy because there's no real Asian food in Chandler! I never have a grimace after Thai Paradise though. I love this place! At the end of the day, nothing hits the spot like their curry pork ribs and Thai iced tea. My husband and I are trying everything on their menu because we love Thai food. The chef is super nice and it is obvious he takes pride in his dishes."}
{"text":"The owner is the host, chef and cashier!  Don't let the interior fool you, it's great food and the owner is super nice!  I had the red curry and my husband had the yellow curry; both were awesome!"}
{"text":"We went here cause the reviews were good but we did not enjoy the food. I ordered the classic thai dish, beef pad thai, the flavor was not how it usually is, it had way too much fish sauce and not enough peanut sauce. I was disappointed because I usually love pad thai, the beef was hard and overcooked. I also ordered the chicken fried rice which was okay...not one of the best dishes, there was too many onions and tomatoes which I usually am ok with but it just didn't taste right. I felt bad for our waiter/cook, he was a one-man show and it was starting to get busy. We had to ask him multiple times for something and he would still forget."}
{"text":"Feeling under the weather? Thai Paradise's Curry Noodle Soup beats anybody's bowl of chicken soup for making you feel better. Yummy."}
{"text":"I keep coming back for the Panang Pork rib curry (only when available).   Delicious!
The owners are a husband and wife that originate from Thailand and they are super nice!"}
{"text":"This guy is the man! Yes I said 1 guy, as far as I've ever seen he's the only owner, waiter, bartender, and cook! If you want some of the best Thai food around, I highly suggest Thai Paradise! Ya the place doesn't look 5 star but you will forget all about it after eating the amazingly delicious food."}
{"text":"I had a craving for Thai food and decided to try this place after checking in with Yelp.  I ordered takeout, had a shrimp pad thai and the chicken drunken noodles, both at level 3 spicy (from 1-4 where 4 is spiciest).  I thought that both dishes were pretty good although I am accustomed to eating spicy food and would not recommend a higher level than 2 for your average foodie. I liked the drunken noodles more than the pad thai -- it was full of flavor and made better by the abundance of thai basil in it.  The only thing that would made it really stellar was if the noodles (chow fun noodles) were a little less soft and more al dente.  But that could be because i ate it 15 mins later and not right at the restaurant so it was soft, and broken up -- just a personal preference, dish was still good.  The pad thai was also good and I might be in the minority here but I do not like too sweet of a pad thai.  Thank goodness, it was not too sweet, a little bit tangy and just right!  I really like the pad thai.  Service was very friendly.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall place in a strip mall.  The owner is the chef and primary waiter, and makes the meals as spicy as you want upon request.  I've been in several times there, and a busy night has 2 tables sat so don't expect a busy place.  The owner is incredibly nice and can help walk you through the menu.  Food is extremely good."}
{"text":"Me and my wife tried Thai Paradise for the first time today. I liked the decor walking in, they don't play out the Thai theme as much as Thai Basil, but it had a more contemporary look. 
I was excited to try their Thai iced tea as it is one of my favorite beverages, and I was not disappointed! I decided to try the Spicy Basil, I ordered it Thai hot, and my wife had the Yellow Curry hot.
The presentation of the food was very nice and the smell is what really got me. Very fresh and you could really smell the spices.
I was used to Thai Basil's hot scale, and I think they wimp it down, maybe because I'm a white guy... Thai Paradise definitely did not though. My wife stated it was the only time she saw me sweat eating spicy food:)
The owner was very nice and we received a coupon for our next visit.
Overall I would say support Thai Paradise, they deserve your business!"}
{"text":"This is such a find.....after living in New York and having access to great Thai....it was so refreshing to find authentic!

The owner is passionate about his food!   That is to be appreciated.

My wife had Yellow Curry and I had Pad See-ew.  Both were excellent.

It has an authentic feel and yet feels clean with an \"A\" rating from the Health Dept"}
{"text":"Since this place is in a large shopping center there is a ton of parking.  I am always a bit leery when I go in for dinner and there is no one else in the restaurant and the owner/manager/server is watching TV and Reading a news paper. The restaurant is ok if a bit cluttered and Asian Grocery store feeling when you come in.  I ordered the Pad See Ewe and my friend ordered Thai Green Beans. Unfortunately they were completely out of green beans... which just seemed odd.  The Pad See Ewe was ok, not really enough broccoli for my taste and not very flavorful or spicy. Can't say I would really recommend this one."}
{"text":"Excellent food :) the pad see iew was great! The owner is a very nice man as well. Will be back. Only issue I had was the chicken. It definitely tastes funky. Like reheated chicken."}
{"text":"Oh no.... I just ate all the crab puffs. This place makes everything from scratch, even the sweet and sour sauce. The curry is the best around and the Pad Thai, Basil Chicken and Sweet and Sour Chicken rocks!

Come here and taste the difference. Best Thai food in Chandler!!"}
{"text":"The sauce for the Seafood Choo Chee was absolutely fabulous and I would return just to drink their Thai Tea again!"}
{"text":"Really small modest place, you can miss it if you are not paying attention. Food is great though, and ALWAYS the exact spice level we order, since everybody in the family likes diff levels lol the food is always spot on and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Arizona has got to be one of the most culinarily (yes, that is a word) inept states in the country...The reason why is that if there's not a location in every shopping plaza or a commercial on every channel, Arizonians will not eat there. The family owned, authentic, \"hole in the walls\" get shut down before they've even had a chance to expand. 

DO NOT let Thai Paradise disappear! If you enjoy real Thai food, great service and reasonable prices this is your spot. I eat here 2-3 times a week and have never had a bad experience. The owners are great and will not let you wait without getting you a bowl of soup and glass of water. Americanized \"Thai\" restaurants would have you believe that all Thai food is super sweet and must always taste like coconut or Curry. While you can find your share of sweet-coconut-curry, the majority of the menu is full of authentic dishes, hand-made noodles and the ability to chose how \"thai\" (aka \"spicy\") you want your dish. (By the way, I go with the medium and it is the perfect amount of spice for me)

The place is never packed, which is a sad thing...If they're ever shut down, I'll be beyond disappointed."}
{"text":"Most of the time when I go to a thai food restaurant I would order pad thai. Its safe, and I really like it. This time however, the guy told me to try the drunken noodles. I gave it a shot and was impressed. I am glad I stopped by and tried something new. Good flavor, reasonable portions and very good pricing!"}
{"text":"OMG! I don't know how this place is still in business. The food was so bad, greasy and undercooked. We just left the food and got away. Thai food is my favorite, but this place ruined my experience and I am not going to eat it for a while!!"}
{"text":"Do not go here, do not be deceived by the yelp reviews claiming this is actually edible food. Something else is going on here. Me and my fiancé went here for quick lunch and when our food came out, we smelled a disgusting sour smell. We couldn't even eat one bit because the smell was so strong like a wet dog. We paid $16.00 and left and are taking our meat to be tested and reporting this restaurant. Oh, the owner does his best to make you feel as awkward as ever. Worst experience ever"}
{"text":"Update: as of the first of the year, they are no longer offering free iced thai tea and iced coffee; although they are offering free soda with a dinner entree purchase."}
{"text":"Chicken Pad Thai is on point! Great and fast service! Will definitely go back and try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the red curry lunch special.  Very good food with authentic spices and flavors!   Excited to find a new Thai place here in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Always hard to find Great authentic Thai food! Thai paradise was a pleasant surprise.  Really enjoyed the panang beef curry.  Very flavorful and he can make it hot!

Owner is really friendly.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! And great service, the guy who served us was super courteous and friendly. We had the Tom Kha (which I didn't want to share with the rest of my table), Crab Fried Rice, and Drunken Noodles. All dishes were freshly prepared, and overall, it's some of the best Thai food I've had in town"}
{"text":"I love this place, I've tried several in the area and nothing compares.  The Curry Noodle is my favorite!  Christian owned and operated, I'll come here from now on."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The flavors were really good, and the portions were huge!. I will definitely be coming again. We had the coconut chicken soup, pad Thai, and pineapple fried rice."}
{"text":"At first glance, one may think this unkept, hard to find, divey establishment may not be a good choice for dinner. However this is some of the best Thai food I've ever had. 
When you walk in you will be greeted by the owner/host/ chef, a Thai immigrant who is working on learning English. He'll cook you up a hearty, mouth-watering authentic meal any night of the week. I recommend the pad Thai and any of the curries. As a warning, don't get anything \"Thai hot\" unless you are prepared to be violently woken up by extreme diahrrea. I frequent this place almost once a week."}
{"text":"Love this place! The owner is so nice and welcoming. He was actually alone that night,  so he took our order AND made our dinner.  The food was awesome! The larb and beef salad reminded me of my mom's cooking and the crushed ice in the Thai tea made it so much better than it already was! My husband had the pad thai and it was delicious! Pictures don't do it any justice. We will definitely be back! Do yourself a favor and go too!"}
{"text":"I tried it and loved it. It's a hole in the wall place. The man that served us was very nice and checked on us multiple times to see if we needed anything. He was careful not to interrupt our conversation. I asked if he was working by himself and he said yes, it's always just him. We ordered the Pad Thai, Red Curry, and Thai Tea. My friend who had never had Thai food before enjoyed the meal as well and said he'd love to come back. The restaurant also received A's from the health inspectors multiple times. I've never left a Yelp review before, but I was just really satisfied with this place to not leave one."}
{"text":"I like to support family owned restaurants but I don't think I'll be back. It was empty at 7:30 on a Friday night, a sign that makes we wary. They had a small menu with mainstream dishes and less of the \"exotic\" Thai items that I find more flavorful and authentic to the SEA (Southeast Asian) palate.  I ordered the Pad Thai for a basis of comparison. The noodles were sitting on too much sauce that was overly sweet. I would have liked more bean sprouts that wasn't cooked in for a fresher crunch.  Portions were nice and not too expensive.

The server was nice enough, but the mediocre food can't lift this review. I'm disappointed if this is one of the best Thai in the Valley."}
{"text":"Sour food other than the rice. Everything we ordered was uneatable. Very disappointed. Seafood soup was sour"}
{"text":"Have been to Thai Paradise 3 times! It's one of my favorite thai places I have eaten at. The owner is awesome. Very friendly and helpful. Every time I have been there I have never had an empty drink. He is great at refilling without asking. He also only uses fresh food prepared daily and makes the best green curry and tom kha I have ever eaten, even better than that \"best thai food in tempe\" place nearby and it's cheaper! Def recommend this place. Great service and great authentic Thai dishes!"}
{"text":"Even though we got there 2 minutes after closing time, the owner opened the door and greeted us with a smile and offered to make our dinner.  Not only was it a nice place, the food was delicious.  We will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Let's just say, you had me at the crab puffs!!

Generous filling, very crispy, and not the typical sweet n sour sauce, instead it was lighter, maybe pineapple? Anyway, a delicious start to our first of many take out orders!

Pad Thai was fantastic, and pineapple fried rice got a great review from hungry hubby. BIG portions in both!

Can't wait to try the curries!

My advice...get a 2nd order of crab puffs. The first six won't make the drive home!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. The actual restaurant is nothing to write home about. Little hole in the wall, next to an American Legion so the smell of smoke can sometimes linger in the air because it comes through the vents. That being said, the food is FANTASTIC! Order it Thai spicy and they mean it!! REAL spice. Not some place trying to cover it up with chili oils and such... it's REAL thai peppers. And it is delicious. Their Thom Kha Gai is one of the tastiest I have had and the Pad Sewee with beef was fantastic as well. The owner, \"Little\" is as sweet as sweet can be. I absolutely LOVE this little known gem."}
{"text":"This place is awesome some of the best Thai food I've had in a long time. Don't let the lackluster interior fool you because there is some amazing food to be had here. My personal favorite Thai dish is the yellow curry with potatoes and onions. Johns is the red curry. They give you a 1-4 scale of how spicy you like and be cautious because when they say hot they mean HOTTTT... But its soooo good. I have only seen one lady working there besides who ever is in the kitchen but she still provides pretty good service even when they are busy.  Overall this is my new favorite spot for Thai food and definitely worth the drive its not close by for you."}
{"text":"Thai Paradise may not have the best location or with the best decorations, but I find that of the Thai restaurants that I have visited, that this is one of the better choices. With friendly service, good food, and reasonable prices, I would recommend this restaurant to anybody. I have not had many of the dishes, but I also have not been disappointed in any of the dishes which I did partake in. I especially enjoy the red curry beef at the spiciest degree and Thai tea (though the Thai coffee and lemonade are enjoyable too). 

I have to agree in regards to it being a more authentic cuisine though. Thai Paradise is culturally owned by Thai, the employees are Thai, and it is frequented by Thai people which are part of my social circle. The setting may not be completely Thai, but the Thai restaurant is not the first restaurant at this location.  

If you have not tried this restaurant, I encourage you to try it out!"}
{"text":"I dropped in Thai Paradise right at 11am one day after a long morning of searching for houses. I walked into an empty restaurant. Certainly not the first empty restaurant I've been in, but it always makes me wonder if the crowd hasn't hit or if it just isn't any good.

In this case, there was no crowd in the next hour, but it certainly wasn't because the food was bad.

I had Pad Thai with beef, and it was great Pad Thai. The noodles were cooked just right, the taste was consistent all the way through to the last bite, and the mound of crushed peanuts was substantial. Maybe I got some special treatment because I was the first customer of the day, but the service was great and the owner/cook/server wasn't overbearing or absent. 

The Thai Tea was some of the best I've ever had. I really should call myself a Thai Tea connoisseur by this point since I've had more of them than I can remember. And Thai Paradise does some great Thai Tea!

Hopefully it isn't always slow for their lunches because I'd like to go back and try their Pad Se Eew or other dishes."}
{"text":"It was empty when we walked in on a Friday night... It must be something wrong - I thought. The food was an \"okay\", there were nothing to rave about . However, the staff/owner seems nice. I may come back for another experience because I have experienced better somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Popped in because of 4 stars, but I don't think I'll be going back.  I had the Tom Yum, which I love at most Thai restaurants, but it was overly seasoned here.  But it's really because of the condition of the bathroom, it needed a serious cleaning.  Otherwise, nice and friendly service."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times and it is always super yummie.  I love the Thai tea,  everything  I have had here is quite good but the spicy basil beef is so far my favorite dish.   If you want some spicy ass Thai food ask him to make it extra Thai hot.   I love spicy food and it was almost to much for me.  Not many places stand up to the hotness scale they offer but here is a different story.  

Always great service and the atmosphere is nice as well.  Filtered water which to me is a must have for any restaurant.  

Come eat here now,  do it now,  not later."}
{"text":"It was okay.  I tried the yellow curry with tofu.  Didn't care for the tofu and wished I had just gotten it with extra veggies.  The eggplant was a little tough.  Hubby had red curry.  Son had panang curry with shrimp.  He liked it but the shrimp still had the tails on it.  He also tried the Thai lemonade.  That I really liked!!!  I do love salt and margaritas though."}
{"text":"I rarely leave a bad review unless it's very bad. I couldn't believe how we were treated. First you'll walk into the restaurant and notice it has a stench you can't explain. We sat down anyway and after reviewing the menu we tried to order some chicken satay. My 5 year old loves satay and it's really all he wants at a Thai food restaurant. We told the only guy working that we would like an order of chicken satay and he said they didn't have any. My mom then asked why and he just laughed and didn't say anything. Then my mom asked my son if he wanted to go somewhere else and the guy said \"fine have a nice day\" in a very puffy tone and left. He wasn't coming back and avoided us for the next five minutes until we left. We were flabbergasted as to what we just saw and I can't remember being treated like that in a restaurant. I didn't have a chance to try any food so our review is only for the restaurants smell and the rude behavior of the man working there. If he's the owner he'll be out of business soon. I'll never step foot in that place again I can promise you. We went a mile north on Alma School to Chon Thai. Where we were greeted very nicely and they have delicious food."}
{"text":"Love this place.  They make their own Bird's Nest out of fresh taro root (yay!), and the food is very fresh.  I have had almost one of everything, and let me tell ya, I am never disappointed.  In case you are not sure what goes in a dish, they also have a wall full of pictures of their main dishes.  

I love their Bird's Nest, Pad Thai, Hunan Noodles (a special), Chicken Noodles, and Mussaman Curry.  I tend to order medium-mild-no heat, and they acommodate my request every time.  I love their limeade and their Iced Thai Tea is the best way to take care of the heat that is included in your plate.

Lunch specials run Monday through Friday, and they usuall include your choice of soup or salad, egg roll wth a little dipping sauce, and the main dish, which may or may not include some rice (if it is a noodle dish, no rice).  Portions are perfect, and the service is quick and efficient.  Really nice people and a very clean place make this one a winner in my book."}
{"text":"I've never had Thai food before so I suppose I have nothing to compare it to, but this restaurant didn't serve very tasty food. Maybe it was just what I ordered. I don't know. Plus it had a funny smell. It wasn't terrible but I'm not going back."}
{"text":"What a hidden jewel!  Don't be put off by the low key atmosphere and location, this place has great food and service.  Little, the owner, cashier, server, and cook, is great."}
{"text":"Thank goodness this place is still there!  All you get is consistently great food in a nice clean cafe.  There are a lot of very good Thai places in the Valley, but this is my all time favorite!"}
{"text":"Very bad. I won't be back. The first sign was there were no Asians eating there. Should have been a clue. Having lived in several Asian countries for many years I know what authentic Thai food is. This isn't it."}
{"text":"Do not let the appearance deceive you. The owner runs it all by himself and always meets expectations. He does his best to make sure everybody gets their food on time (I've witnessed)... but the portions are big! When you order togo, your whole box is filled, so I usually have leftovers for lunch or whatever the next day. 

If you are someone who loves spicy like I do, I would order hot but get more hot sauce on the side. Overall my go to Thai spot in Arizona."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love Thai food. we have been to most Thai restaurants in the east valley. That being said, Thai paradise has the BEST Thai food we've ever had!! The place is small and tucked into a strip mall, but don't let that stop you! The owner/ server puts out some amazing food. Try the Pad See Ew, def my favorite!! Thai Paradise is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This Place Is Amazing, Best yellow curry I've had in Arizona. The owner is super friendly and attentive. I'll be going back to try the spicy bazil"}
{"text":"I've been to Thai Paradise several times now since they've changed ownership some time last year. I mainly order for take out but have dined in once or twice. The food here is quite yummy and the prices are reasonable. They offer lunch specials daily until 3 which is a bonus for when I'm craving Thai food for lunch on the weekend. I also like the fact that there is no price hike up for the same dish just because it's dinner time on their regular menu. Portions are pretty generous and a regular order usually gives me two meals. 

*What seperates this from other Thai places in the area: 

-They have thai spicy spaghetti here (like Noodle World in CA)
-They have Thai Boat Noodles (only place I know of in AZ)

Also on my last visit, I've noticed they got some new tables and chairs which made the place much nicer. I also like the huge city lights portrait on one of the walls. The decor is simple but it works. 

*Side note: minimum $10 purchase for cards."}
{"text":"It wasn't the worst Thai we've ever been to.  It's also not the best.  My Pad Thai tasted like the sauce came from a mix.  It probably didn't, but it lacked the complexity of the house made ones I'm used to.  Hubby's curry was nothing to rave about...he doesn't even remember what he had when I asked him.   Little cutie pie shared my noodles.   

We'll keep on searching!"}
{"text":"Service was good.

We had takeout. The noddles for one of the entrees were charred, so much that we couldn't eat it, so it ruined it for me. Very unfortunate, we won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I just moved to this area and are still checking out different restaurants. 

We loved it! 
The owner was host, server, bartender and chef!! 

It was awesome and he was super nice. I had pad Thai and my wife had green curry, both were delicious. 

I highly recommend this for true foodies who like traditional and non-Americanized cuisine."}
{"text":"The Tom Kha always brings me in, then I have to stay for the drunken noodle and a Thai tea! The restaurant is pretty tiny and you can sometimes hear awful karaoke from next door, but the food is worth it. I resorted to Thai Rama once when my Thai craving hit and they were closed, never again...the taste does not even compare. It's never been busy when we go in, so if you're looking for a new Thai place give it a shot; I would be heartbroken if they went out of business."}
{"text":"I read all the great reviews, so I thought that I would try it out. It's very close to my home. When I turned into the place, my heart sank. I had been there several years ago and, at that time, it had been THE WORST Thai place EVER!.. However, I did read, that the owners had changed  hands. SO, I figured, that I would give it a try. I got there today, after 6 pm, Saturday. It was empty. I ordered the \"Crying Tiger\", because I had read good reviews about this dish and it looked good in the picture. The meat was tough and tasteless. It came with a very hot sauce on the side. Since I am not fond of hot spicy food, I just added a tiny bit of the sauce to each piece of meat. 
While I was sitting there, a family of 5 came for dinner. I was glad to see, that he did have some more customers come in. 
I wanted to cry, thinking that I had wasted $15.00, plus tax. With that kind of money, I could have had a nice dinner at a Korean restaurant or at a Vietnamese place. 
I know, that I will not return.
The owner, though, is nice."}
{"text":"A clean little thai place tucked in a strip mall. They have 5.95 lunch specials. The food was okay..nothing to rave about, but not bad either. The waitress was sweet, and the service was good. The thai iced tea was yummy."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai  food and lots of options. Loved my drunken noodles. Very nice and great service too. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday due to the rave reviews and that it was supposed to be cheap.  Unfortunately, they only do lunch specials on weekdays (not out of the ordinary I suppose) so my lunch entree was $8 plus my soda so about $14 with tax/tip which I normally wouldn't consider \"cheap\" for lunch.  

BUT, the food was AWESOME.  I had the drunken noodles with tofu.  It was the first time ever that I couldn't eat all the noodles (believe me, I tried).  Huge portion, and very tasty.  I asked for a \"medium\" spicy and it was perfect - just a little too spicy - just how I like it.  My only complaint about the food was that the tofu was a little too chewy/hard.  I didn't specifically want soft tofu, but they fried it too long in my opinion.  Otherwise, very yummy.  And did I mention that there were a TON of noodles?  Seriously. 

I will definitely try to stop in during lunch on a weekday and try something else on their menu.  I have a feeling it will all be good."}
{"text":"Great food , big portions , cool way to serve  soup , prices are good , the owner is willing to adjust food items for  vegetarians"}
{"text":"This place looks a lot worse than it is. The poorly shot photos of their food on their windows and walls do not do them any favors. I wound up eating here by chance when I was bringing back a group of teens to the JCC a few doors down--we had a few minutes for lunch before bringing the rest of the kids back to tucson. Most of the kids wound up in the mexican place next door, and seeing as we were pressed for time, I decided that Id get some thai food since I love thai. I asked the lady in there if I could get something very quickly to go, she said no problem. I asked if I should get the pad thai or the yellow curry, she said get the yellow curry. So I did. She asked me how hot (and knowing that I had a cold and wanted something kinda spicy, but also momentarily forgetting that I was in a thai restaurant) I told her \"make it pretty hot\". In retrospect, I might have used a bit more caution with that statement. I also ordered some crab puffs which i know is not authentic, but i was in the mood. The crab puffs turned out to be excellent. Just different enough from your standard chinese food arrangement and yet still delicious with their different style dipping sauce. The yellow curry was AMAZING, albeit a LITTLE bit spicier than I would have liked on a normal day...well, actually, it was a freakin inferno...but it felt good to eat it with my cold and all. Just be advised ;) Would definitely go back next time im in the area. My only complaints were that it took a little bit longer than I would have liked considering my situation, but had I been sitting down it would not have been a problem, and secondly the price was a little high I felt. It was after 3 (so a late lunch, i guess) and wound up having to pay the dinner prices. The two orders, without a drink came to about $15. Not terrible, but a little more than I would have liked to pay."}
{"text":"Within the last few years, I've seen a bunch of Thai food eateries spring up here in the valley, so I'm anxious to try them all!! I love the Thai culture and appreciate the differences in the food because Thais are not known to share recipes and the food tastes vary, depending on where the cook (or in this case chef) is from. I not only love the way that Mr.Little (the owner)  brings out the natural flavors of the food but by the way he compliments the tastes with sauces/spices. i have never had a noodle that was as soft and creamy as the drunken noodle and the coconut curry has reinvigorated my love for curry. The prices are well worth it since I had enough food left over for a second helping."}
{"text":"I've only seen one person working in here (I assume he's the owner), but he's a sweet man and has remembered me and my friend when we've come in on a couple occasions.  I've never been disappointed with my food no matter what I order, though the Pad Thai has been my favourite by far, and if I had the money, I'd definitely be more of a regular."}
{"text":"Been here before.  First time (a few years ago) was pretty good.  Last experience wasn't great.  Seems like each visit is worse than the last.  Gave them one more try. 

Service was brusque. Flavors were mediocre, most dishes too sweet.

Not coming back.

Not much more to say."}
{"text":"Great food, Tom Yum and Pad Thai were amazing dishes! I will be going back! The chef (I think also owner) is the nicest man and cooks authentic dishes. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Best Penang curry ever and we are Thai food connoisseurs. Fantastic egg rolls too! Excellent service and they sent us away with free to go refill of their divine Thai ice tea. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, definitely appeased my cravings. Will definitely be back. The red curry, Thai fried rice, and Rangoon was delicious. Pad Thai was a little too sweet for my liking."}
{"text":"Impressive One Man Show With Good Food!

So to start out this is an interesting place because the owner very friendly and is also the cook, waiter, busboy, dishwasher and everything all in one which makes him a hard worker!

I had the pad si ew chicken and it was good.

Most importantly is the curry chicken noodle which was pretty awesome! Flavor packed and a good serving size. I strongly recommend eating this!

Give him a try!"}
{"text":"Overall: For the price the food is better than most. Not my first, or second choice, but it would be my 3rd in the Chandler area.

Ambiance: 1
- old, run down strip mall location
Decor: 1
- not a place you want to stay in. Clean, yes but really made to be a take out location
Food quality: 3
- I think the quality was good
Food quantity: 3
- portions were decent but lacked meat/veggies in the curry dishes.
Food preparation: 4
- everything was properly cooked.
Service: 5
- very nice people, very attentive

Green curry... A bit thin IMO, good flavor just to light for me. 
Steak salad... Loved the flavors. A bit small for the cost. Need to chop up the cabbage, not leave a chunk on the plate.
Musman curry... very thin, lacked flavor, very average overall
TomYum... pretty flavorful, about middle of the road for this soup."}
{"text":"Small and quaint. The owner Little is very attentive and cooked me a special no sugar meal. So happy to have a Tai restaurant in my backyard!"}
{"text":"A classic hole-in-the-wall, hidden gem in Chandler. 

The flavors are excellent. The prices are better than any Thai restaurant around. 

The food is fresh, fast, and authentic. 

Amazing food in a humble venue, like most truly great finds. 

I can't believe that just one man is running this joint. 

Don't hesitate to stop by, fill your craving for delicious Thai food, and support small business!"}
{"text":"Please do your body a favor and don't eat here. There was a single person in the restaurant taking order and cooking food. We ordered crab Rangoon's, green curry and pad thai. Easily, It was the most disgusting food on the planet the crab puffs were drenched in oil, green curry uncooked and the pad thai was made of sugar syrup.. horrible experience!!! 

I am glad we didn't eat the food we could have been hospitalized."}
{"text":"I found Thai Paradise from the great Yelp reviews and couldn't be happier with the food and the service. Great Pad Thai and fried rice for a small place. The only thing I will add is there was an unpleasant cigarette smell coming from the next door Legion club. It probably only happens in the evenings but I didn't like it and I didn't want my kids near it either."}
{"text":"I went on a Monday and it was slow. I was the only customer there at dinner hours. I was greeted immediately upon entering and the gentleman behind the counter was the only person there working. He was the cook and the waiter. The place looked deserted and he was on his cell phone the entire meal. But I could care less about that! Now on to the food.... I ordered Thai rice with chicken that had cold spots in the rice and some pieces of the chicken were rubbery as if it was undercooked and I had to spit it out! I also ordered Yum Tom soup that had chicken, mushrooms, and tomatoes. I got it Thai hot and it was very spicy and full of lime flavor which I enjoyed and was happy with. The only way I would come back here is if I catch a cold and need some spicy yet tasty soup to knock out the sickness from my body. Other than that I will not be back. The entire time I was eating the food here I was thinking about one of my favorite Chinese restaurant (Chou's Kitchen) right next door to Thai Paradise! I can't end this without mentioning that I paid $17.00 dollars + tax  for a small plate of cold chicken Thai rice $11.00, and a sample size portion of Yum Tom soup $6.00. I left feeling ripped off and unsatisfied."}
{"text":"A MUST TRY!

My husband and I have been searching for good Thai food in the area.  We were not expecting a lot as we have yet to find good Thai food here in Arizona.

At Thai Paradise were pleasantly surprised with the authenticity of the cuisine.  The food here is fantastic!!!!  Definitely bursting with flavor and Thai Hot was perfectly spicy.  A great kick but not too much that it was over powering any of the great flavors.

My husband ordered the Curry Noodles with Chicken and I had the Spicy Basil with Beef.  Both were delicious!  And echoing what Jamie M. wrote, great depth and complexity in the flavors!  We enjoyed it much more than Thai Rama.  We're glad we tried this place, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great local family ran little restaurant. I ordered the Panang curry and my BF got the Thai basil. Both dishes were very good with great flavor and nice portions. The same person who took our order also made our food, presumably the owner. He was very nice a friendly. Good prices too. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"The yellow curry is so good and the portion size is enough to have leftovers! I got a level 4 out of 5 spice and loved it. The owner is really nice and works really hard, I have never seen anyone else working the shop except him. Thanks for a great experience as always!"}
{"text":"Had their red curry beef togo and it was pretty good! What wasn't good was their curry packagjng. The lid literal broke off so I wasn't able to reuse the lid to bring leftover home. Rice wasn't as fresh and egg roll side wasn't as good as it could be. Overall 3.5 stars and will come back!"}
{"text":"Headed to Thai Paradise on Mother's Day with my sons around 4:30.  I was so looking forward to trying this place based on the many positive reviews.  When we walked in the door there was a sign by the register that said \"Cash Only Today\".  The man greeted us and I said \"Sorry, I don't have any cash on me\" and we turned around and left.  I debated going to another place, but instead decided to see where a Chase Bank was close by so I could grab some cash.  Lucky for us there was a Chase just a block down (big surprise...lol)  Anyway, waited behind two other really slow cars in the ATM lane, finally got the cash and headed back.  The whole thing took about 15 minutes.  Walked back up to the restaurant, grabbed the door handle and it was locked!  Really?  15 minutes!  And they're supposed to be open until 8pm!  Needless to say, we didn't eat there.  I'm giving them a 3 star because I have to give them something and I figure a 3 won't affect their average.  I do still want to try this place, but I'm a little weary to just head on over there, knowing now that they'll just close whenever they feel like it.  What made the whole thing even worse is that the whole intersection at Ray and Alma School was under construction.  You can't make left turns hardly anywhere so just to get to the place and then leave the place....two times....took a ridiculous amount of parking lot turnarounds.  Ugh!  BTW, we ended up going to Palee's Crown and it was fabulous!"}
{"text":"I think they changed the owner or something.  I used to like this place, but today i bought sweet and sour chicken, it smelled so weird.  Like something is just not right (old ingredients? or old rice?).  This is my first time writing a review online and this restaurant deserve my time so that i can warn everyone about this place.  Save your time and money, and maybe your health by avoiding this place.  It used to be a good restaurant, not anymore."}
{"text":"Best local Thai food! I had the beef see-ew this time and it was delicious! Very flavorful and the host was great! Very fast service and I appreciated the one on one service he provided. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"my boyfriend and i stopped in for lunch one day but just barely missed the lunch specials. Darn!

i love panang curry with a passion. whenever i am about to eat it or when i am craving it i imagine all the terrific spices that give it a real kick. unfortunately when i smothered my rice with my curry and chicken i took my bite and was just kind of stuck. it tasted as though my curry had been watered down IMMENSELY. based on the fact that i feel as though i got the wrong order or something i am scared to even try anything else. my boyfriend said that the pad thai was good but did not say if it was any better or worse than my favorite spot in arizona  Thai Rama oh how i love that place. but of course not more than my favorite place in tracy, CA. 

But this place was just ehhhh for me. never going back."}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick up some dinner on the way home and was craving some curry. Ended up grabbing the yellow curry with tofu. It was absolutely delicious with just the right amount of kick and good amount of tofu. Will definitely hit up this place again when I have a craving for Thai. Just make sure you're patient as I believe it's a one man show with the owner acting as the waiter and chef."}
{"text":"Good, but I thought it was kind of pricey for what you got. I've definitely had better Thai food for the price.

My girlfriend is Thai and also thought this place was decent but overpriced."}
{"text":"I love atmosphere. As in great vibe. Clean, low lighting, swanky, romantic atmosphere. Or great music, quaint, etc.. ok, that out of the way~ do not come here for the atmosphere. It is not a 1st nor second nor 3rd date location. 
What it is is unquestionably great Thai food. So done alone, take an older relationship, get it to go, but by all means put this on your list of must go..
Just minus one star - lacking atmospheric presence."}
{"text":"We have tried 3 other Thai Restaurants and nothing compares to this place. The food is fantastic, the portions are big enough we end up with lunch for the next day. The owner is great. This may not be the fanciest place or have a huge wait staff but I'll take this place over any other Thai place in a 10 mile radius. We have tried a few different plates and every one of them has been great. The panang, yellow curry, green curry and red curry with pineapple are our favorites. Can't go wrong with whatever you order. Thai spicy is the perfect heat to order if you like a little heat to your food. 

The owner is great and super friendly. Don't hesitate to give this place a try. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"I was debating between 3 or 4 but decided on 4 because of how nice the man working was and how good the food was. 

The problem was our timing I think. We went right after lunch break and we're the only people there. I ordered lime aid but it wasn't ready and was going to take 15 MIN so I went for root beer which was on the menu but they were out. Also when I went to the ladies room there were no towels and when I asked for some he directed me to the men's room... I'm fine with this however, I had wet hands and had to open the door again etc when he could've handed me a towel. Again, no biggie at all! He was super nice the whole time. Just something I noticed! 

The food was delicious! We ordered veggie egg rolls to start. They were super flakey and light and yummy!  

Chicken Pad Thai was also really delicious. It was more saucy than most places which I enjoyed!"}
{"text":"My gf and I were looking to get some Thai food and found this place. The owners service and food was possibly the best Thai we've had in the valley!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is another one of those hole in the wall places that you think will be bad but turns out great. The prices is average for any normal Thai food place. The food was really good, the egg rolls were amazing, and the red curry was great! The only complaint was the curry was a little too hot for me even with it being mild. But the owner was nice and friendly, cooked and served us which is nice. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This was my first time here & I must say I am quite impressed! 

First off, the owner was the absolute sweetest man & very courteous. He was quick to help me while entertaining the dine-in guests. He was also short staffed & was still able to get my take out order put together and complete my purchase fast.

The food was really good!! We ordered the egg rolls- quite yummy! Also the cream puffs which were pretty standard. The chicken pad thai (medium) & beef drunken noodles (medium) were delish!! The drunken noodles were much spicier than the pad Thai. 

Definitely going back here :)"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Thai restaurants and none has ever been this disappointing. I always judge each by their Pad Thai and this place has the worst I've ever tasted.  Highly recommend you try someplace else first!"}
{"text":"I happened to be craving curry so I ordered the curry noodles. I'm not and expert in ordering Thai food and was expecting something else. I was disappointed when I saw a bowl being served but again this is what I had ordered. I decided to give it a try, and boy was I impressed. I've had curry before but this was a little thicker and had so much more flavor. I will definitely be coming back & trying other plates."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much when I walked into this little hole-in-the-wall in a less than enticing strip mall. But how wrong I was. I had the red curry with tofu and it was absolutely phenomenal. The tofu was fried to perfection, not over done. The red curry was creamy, delicious, and perfectly spiced. My boyfriend's Thai basil tofu was equally delicious. The food came out fast and the prices were reasonable. I will definitely be coming back to try more dishes. Green curry next!"}
{"text":"Best Thai tea great food good prices excellent service little (the owner) is the best."}
{"text":"This place isn't horrible, but I wouldn't go back if I had a choice.  Like a previous review, I have to agree that the location wasn't that great, it's a dying strip mall, but I never let location influence my judgment of the place, as for the atmosphere, it's nothing special or awful, it's forgettable.
Now the reason for the rating is the food.  It's ok, but I'm not a Thai food connoisseur, so I'm just judging on how much I like it.  It tasted fine, but it didn't rock my taste buds or have me give a pause and wonder what in the awesome world did I just awesomely put in my mouth! It's a restaurant you probably would visit when you are hungry, all the other restaurants are closed and you happen to be in the neighborhood. Nothing horrible about the place, but nothing memorable either.
I had:
Curry (I think it was green curry)
Sticky Rice with Mango (I will never try this desert again)
Thai Ice Tea (Not bad, pretty good)

And like this review, this restaurant is rather bland."}
{"text":"Worst Thai food ever !!!
The noodle is dry and extremely spicy . Ive always had Thai hot at other Thai places and had no problem except for this place .  The veggie with tofu dish looks icky ! I threw the whole thing in the trash w o even tasted it .  Will never return"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, lots of great reviews. We decided to try it & it was amazing!"}
{"text":"This is only the second Thai place I've tried in AZ, but it far exceeds the previous restaurant.

I phone an order ahead, and it was ready in less than 10 minutes.  The restaurant was clean, and had plenty of people going in an out, which is also a good sign.

I placed an order for chicken pad thai with a side order of egg rolls.

The pad thai had complete, excellent flavor.  It could have used a tiny bit more chicken, but nothing I would seriously complain about.  We ordered the mild, but will try medium next time.

The egg rolls also had excellent flavor, especially with the sweet & sour sauce.

My wife and I were able to split a single order of both, have plenty for seconds, and even a little bit of leftovers.  We will definitely order from there again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch today.  Small place in a strip mall that feels like every other hole in the wall Thai place you've ever been to in the valley.  I would guess it would sit about 30 people total.  

The lunch special started with a chicken vegetable soup that was really simple and tasty.  I had the pork Pad Thai (medium spicy level).  Food was tasty, just the right amount of spice and served with a small egg roll.

Thai Lemonade was...um...interesting.  Definitely agree with other reviews that note lime and salt in the mix.  Refreshing but I don't know that I would call it lemonade in any classic sense.

Recommended."}
{"text":"Had lunch on a hot Sunday.  They are not open but owner will whip up lunch for you while he's prepping the next weeks food.  Had pad see ewe - good.  Had Khao Soi (curry noodle soup) - hard to find and often bad -downright awesome, just like I had in Chiang Mai - turn out owner is from there.  Makes authentic Nam Prik (look it up) if you ask.  Damn! right here in Chandler, I'm tearing up. Going in the rotation for sure."}
{"text":"3pm in the afternoon, and the other Thai places in the area are closed.  So headed here to get the Thai fix, and so glad we did!  Walked in, place was empty, with only one (owner?) person there - host, server, and cook.  And he was very nice and gracious.  We had pad see ew is my usual baseline Thai dish for comparison.  Here, is was perfectly smokey, savory, fish saucy, and one je ne sais quios spice that I have never noticed in a pad see yew before.  Truly good.  And the pad Thai was not smothered in sweet peanut butter crap sauce like some places.  Just well balanced and texture rich.  We had chicken in both, so I can speak to the other proteins.  However, this is definitely above the regular \"good\" Thai. 

Other customers did walk in as we were there.  All of their food looked good (but they didn't share).  I will be back, that is for sure!"}
{"text":"Was craving Thai food and wanted a close by place to get some take-out. Tried Thai Paradise for take out and am impressed! I got chicken Pad Thai and chicken Panang - both were very delicious!! We will be trying other dishes from here soon.

The gentleman who took the order was nice, and the lady who checked out my order at the restaurant was very friendly and sweet! While the place is small, it's clean and nice. And it had patrons sitting and enjoying lunch - so while some reviews say it looks dead, the place knows Thai food."}
{"text":"The Thai food here is \"alright.\" It's not bad but maybe for my taste buds, it was a little on the bland side.  I ordered Shrimp Pad Thai (I thought them skimped on eggs, bean sprouts & green onion) which that dish normally has those ingredients. We also ordered the pork lab (this was good), chicken satay (peanut sauce was bland and thin and cucumber salad did not have much flavor) and yellow curry (thumbs up). I give my overall take out experience an average rating because it was literally \"alright,\" it would satisfy your craving for Thai food."}
{"text":"Thai Paradise has been one of my favorite places to go for Pad See-Ew. I have had a difficult time finding good Pad See-Ew since moving here. Their portions are large and could last two meals (I'm a early 20's male and I eat a lot). For the price it wasn't too bad, but I still thought it was a bit on the pricy side. I got to know the owners very quickly and they would know my name, face, and order when I would come in or call my order in. I've only ever had the Pad See-Ew and their egg rolls and I love them both! The place is small and quiet which makes it a good place to just relax and talk. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good Pad See-Ew."}
{"text":"The drunken noodles..... Get them now. 

The restaurant owner is very nice and you can tell he loves what he does. Now don't let the layout throw you. It may not be the fanciest but the noodles are goooood. We ll be back. 

Price 3.5/5 average 
Atmosphere 3/5 
Food 5/5"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time tonight for dinner. Saw great reviews on Yelp. The place was empty, smelled like trash and the owner was extremely rude to us.  We left without ordering. In our way to Thai Rama right now"}
{"text":"So happy to be the first to review this wonderful new Thai spot!

As I am the first I'm going to be a bit... verbose. That is my nature by default and here I feel it is somewhat justified, so pardon the upcoming lack of concision. 

I'm one of those who rates Thai food right after sushi as far as favorite cuisines go. As such, I have tried just about every Thai restaurant in the valley [and have many favorite dishes at varying places]. Thai Paradise is newcomer but it does a stellar job of living up to its name. 

The decor is pleasant, bright and vibrant. The chairs are the weakest link comfort-wise, but they're not major enough of a hindrance to prevent enjoying the food. It's pretty small and as such there aren't very many tables [I didn't count but I'd guess it wouldn't seat more than 20 at a time]. 

Went there to eat dinner with six other hungry [or, four hungry, two starving] yogis after a heated yoga class at the always excellent Inner Vision Yoga [just one mile west of this restaurant]. Upon arrival we ordered drinks and apps [Thai Iced Tea, Iced Coffee, \"Thai Lemonade,\" crab puffs and egg rolls]. Drinks came out immediately, and were all delicious. I am not much of a coffee drinker but I would down one of those Thai Coffees any day of the week. VERY tasty [same for the Iced Tea]. The lemonade is homemade and tasted like it had lime and also some salt in it. I wasn't really crazy about the salt to be honest, as I LIKE the puckery sourness of lemonade. One diner said it tasted like a virgin margarita, and that's pretty right on.

The apps arrived and this was our first indication that we were in for really excellent service. The orders come with six to an order, which we knew would leave one person wanting in our party of seven... Not so! As the owner added an extra of each with no charge so we could all enjoy. The crab puffs and egg rolls were fantastic, but the real star of the appetizer course was the dipping sauce. Unexpectedly subtle and complex in flavor, clearly not a throwaway. Not that plasticy sweet n sour garbage you get at a lot of places, this was delicate but flavorful and perfect for balancing the richness of the fried food.

The entrées arrived very promptly and all were delicious. I am a fan of a lot of heat in my Thai food, but we were doing it family style so I couldn't order anything 'thai hot.' I'll be back very soon to try that level of spice so I can comment on it. As they were, everything was very tasty. We tried several old standbys: Pad Thai, [Tofu] Red Curry and Pad see ew. All were fabulous [though I wish we could've ordered them hotter]. We also ordered some of the place's special dishes that are definitely not Thai standards. 

\"Rama shrimp\" is fried shrimp in a panang-ish curry on top of fresh spinach and served with crispy noodles. Pretty great, unlike anything I've had before. 

My favorite though was the \"Seafood Spaghetti\" Ridiculous amount of flavor in this dish. Scallops, mussels, shrimp and actual spaghetti with some kind of INSANE sauce. 

Didn't get a chance to try their mango sticky rice dessert, which is my favorite dessert in all of dessert-dom, but will definitely do so next time. 

The value of this place is phenomenal, great portion sizes for very reasonable prices. Clearly the owners recognize that serving amazing food at a great price is a recipe for success.

All in all I can't wait to eat here again and try more of the menu. Like, all of it.

edit: I just wanted to elaborate, as I've had some messages inquiring about the value... When I say value, I mean it! Seven of us ate for $67 dollars. That's including drinks and appetizers. Ridiculous, given the tastiness of it all."}
{"text":"Well this was an unexpected delicious meal! I had the chicken Thai Rice! It was delicious! It felt it was a home cooked meal, generous size portions. My wife had the Curry Noodles and it was delicious as well! 2 for 2! Not a bad place to eat"}
{"text":"I go to Thai community church in Gilbert and Thai people love this restaurant. My Thai friend, he is a single guy, eat there 3-7 days a week since he does not cook. He said the food is authentic and close to the taste of his home food. So.. what else can I say? I went there 2 week the first time I got introduced.  There is a special order only on Saturday or Sunday and not in the menu, only exlusive people know (which is only Thai community know), you have to call to ask about that special menu, the one that I tried is Kao Mun Gai. It is like heaven! It is a thai version of hainamese chicken rice dish. O gosh.. I just want to go there again to just eat that. Last Sunday I tried the lunch special of curry noodle. It is excellent!! I recommend this place definitely!"}
{"text":"Good and cheap Thai place close to home for the days I crave Thai food or am just too lazy to cook. The owner and chef is very friendly and often adds an extra side of fruit to my order. 

The red and green curry are both very good, but slightly too sweet. The pad Thai and drunken noodles are a good and the portions are generous. The Thai beef salad is well marinated, but the beef is on the chewy side."}
{"text":"Second time here, missed the food a lot. The owner is super nice, he alters the dishes based on what I want but keep the authentic Thai food spirt in the dishes. Totally worth the long driving here."}
{"text":"Great Thai food.  We know most thai food restaurants in the area and went here for the first time.  Service and food were both excellent.  My daughter ordered without spice and ordered spicy and both were made to order.  I came from Chicago where Thai food was on every corner and I am happy to have found this place.  The flavors are right on and the portions are great too.  I will be back and will also pick up food to go.  Our bill was $40 for 3 people including drinks and a dessert."}
{"text":"We had an awesome experience at Thai Paradise. We ordered take out and the food was ready as soon as we walked in. The owner was waiting for us with the food and was very friendly. We ordered pad Thai and the portion sizes were huge and the food was amazing! Great flavor and the perfect amount of spice. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall on Alma School & Ray you'll find this little gem .. The owner is a one man show.. he takes your order, makes the food, delivers it to your table, refills your drinks.. welcomes new diners in, takes phone orders.. pretty effortless! And he does it with a smile!! 

The place was empty when I walked in, I asked the owner what he recommended.. Thai basil with chicken .. medium heat and a side of egg rolls.. food came out timely and hot!! 

The egg rolls were a little greasy but overall the food had lots of flavor, and the serving sizes were generous.

I will most definitely be back.. lunch specials $6.50..    the couple after me were regulars and he joked they always get the same thing.. the patron responded I know what I like and it's always good!"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in Chandler and I've tried them all. The only place that will actually make dishes spicy if you ask them to. Thai Rama pales in comparison. Latitude Eight is too Americanized, expensive, and small portioned. Give this place the credit and chance it deserves!!!

Really great quick service with amazing food. The larb, beef salad and egg rolls are great appetizers and I always get the pad kee mao (drunken noodles). My girlfriend loves their pad Thai. They also make a mean Tom Kha kai. I want to try their spaghetti seafood and beef noodle soup in the future."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai Restaurants in the East Valley!

I always order the Pad Thai. The one here has a good balance of sweet, spicy and savory flavors. Its a little saucy (which I prefer), not dry like some restaurants. HUGE portions for dinner, enough for left overs for lunch the next day. 

My boyfriend gets the Yellow Curry. It's nice and thick/creamy. Really, good flavor as well.

Catfish Pad Ped is another one of our favorite dishes! Who doesn't love crispy, fried fish covered in sauce?! 

The owner is an extremely nice man. He's your waiter, chef, and bus boy. Yet, he still gives great service unlike some other asian restaurants (yah, you know the ones that never come to your table, rush you out with the check but expect a bomb tip ). 

Also, fast take out during the crazy lunch rush compared to other restaurants nearby!"}
{"text":"I had the Pork See-ew (lunch special #2) with flat noodles and soup. It was excellent. I had the medium (which is between the lowest mlld and hottest - spicy Thai) which I found to be perfect spicy - just enough to make me sweat a little bit... The soup was very good too.

The place is not in a \"great\" area, but the restaurant was clean and felt like a cool place to eat. We were there as a group of 4 and were alone from 11:00 to 11:45. 

Food was delivered pretty quickly and soup was brought out very quickly. Soup...

Service was not really great. It wasn't bad per-se, but the waitress was not very friendly. Felt more put out that she had to be working... But she did a god job with orders and such, just not very polite/friendly.

I'd still go there again for sure!"}
{"text":"\"The sauce is so great I will want to lick the plate!\" Said during our dinning. It's been said in the reviews that this place is a hidden gem, without a doubt this place lives up to it. I'm so glad to have been recommended by you all yelpers. I will definitely return to try the drunken noodles. My tai basil had so much flavor, juice ran down my chin. For veggie lovers, the tofu is perfectly prepared with an open fave cut and full of texture to grab and soak up what ever dish you order. I feel safer now and anticipate the sea food for next visit. 

Four stars for now, as you know the last star is for consistency, and this is my first rave review here."}
{"text":"This is a modest little place tucked into an unassuming Chandler strip mall.  Good food, low prices, generous portion sizes and exemplary, fast customer service are all reasons you should give it a try.  

I had a Spicy Basil with chicken that was delicious.  My kids all had the Yellow Curry with chicken and they had no complaints about their food either.

Additionally, my 4 year old daughter spotted a strawberry milk the owner had in his refrigerator case (for himself, not a menu item) and she wanted to order it and I tried to explain to her that it wasn't on the menu but he insisted on giving it to her.  I thought that was very sweet.  Then as we were leaving he gave all of my kids little Thai fruit candies as we were leaving.

Try this little place, I think you'll be impressed!"}
{"text":"I had a taste for yellow curry, I used Yelp of course and ordered the lunch special and a large Thai tea. Once I got home I ate my food and I really enjoyed it. I was a lil annoyed with the amount of ice in my Thai Tea cause it seems as if I paid $3.99 for a cup of ice, but overall the food was good and the tea was excellent. I will definitely go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"I've been to three other Thai restaurants in the Chandler/Gilbert/Mesa area, by far the best. The yellow curry was amazing. The owner is on top of everything, not to mention really funny. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Owner was super nice! The wife had the Pad Thai curry and I had the drinken noodles. The food was great! I'm visiting this area and we plan on coming back before we leave town. It definitely a gold mine."}
{"text":"I was excited to see that they had curry noodle on their menu!! 

First place in Arizona that actually had it on their menu. First time I've had curry noodle with chicken was in Utah. 

The curry noodle here was filled with flavor and spices! I asked for medium spice and it was perfect.. The dish stayed hot the whole time I was eating it. Just how I like it. 

Good prices, my meal was only $9.99 and it came with a side of broth with veges in it. 

The owner does everything himself, he cooks, he's the server and waiter! He does it all. Impressive!"}
{"text":"Tried it again. Last time. The food is just off and the service is just way too slow. 

Tried speaking Thai to the owner and he ignored me.

Thai hot food should be HOT. Especially when you ask for it hot! When you ask for a side of Thai chili and they give you Jalapeños in Fish sauce they are just taking short cuts.

No more."}
{"text":"PL2. Pad See-ew stir-fried flat noodle, egg, broccoli, black sweet soy sauce and your choice of meat

was great... not quite as good as SWADEE but the prices are...

ALSO Weekends do not have LUNCH SPECIAL... Kind of shocked me when i got my bill.. 

Will definitely be going back.. This could easily be a weekly stop.. (During Lunch Mon-Fri)"}
{"text":"Second time here. Still like the place. I had the chicken BBQ. It was a special not on the menu. The chicken was well marinated and cooked. I feel like the rice could be better, but I am not complaining!  For less than 10$ this place is a steal . Very tidy and clean especially considering the price of the food. What's even better is that the chicken is halal!"}
{"text":"I love this place from the food to the nice man who runs it. I could eat here everyday I would be completely happy!"}
{"text":"I was craving Pad Thai but with my shellfish and MSG allergy, I can't just go anywhere so I checked YELP! and found Thai Paradise.  I stopped in for my chicken pad thai and as reviewed, its just one nice gentleman cooking, taking orders and working the entire place - tucked away in a strip mall.

He was very nice and although I offered to go get cash for my (less than $10 order), he happily accepted my debit card.  The Pad Thai hit the spot and reminded me of what I got back home in Cleveland!  Next time I will ask for less spicy but I wanted to try their version before I decided how hot to order.  I'm a big wussy when it comes to spice, some may like it hotter than it comes!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best place for Thai! Come here often for lunch at least twice a week sometimes. The owner who Is also the cook and waiter is very friendly. Small place with big flavor. Lunch comes with a soup which is full of flavor a light broth and order the pad Thai. He gives very big portions! Fast cheap and delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband and I read the rave reviews on this website. We were craving Thai and had recently moved to Chandler, so we headed out to Thai Paradise with high hopes due to the high ratings.

 While the ambiance was definitely lacking, we don't let that affect our judgment of a restaurant. The waitress was courteous when we walked in. Our order was not yet ready, but she told us to have a seat and it would be just a moment. She asked if we wanted a drink, as well. I got a Thai iced tea which was good.

She carefully wrapped up our food and we were on our way home. We ordered the curry noodle with tofu, and the green curry with tofu. It smelled delicious. Upon opening the container I noted that the curry appeared to be watered down quite a bit. This was not something I had ever experienced at any other Thai restaurant. Unfortunately, it was watered down so much, it ended up being sub-par, and I was thoroughly disappointed. The curry noodle was alright, but nothing too great. I was left still hungry, and yet not wanting a second helping as I often do. Furthermore, people have mentioned the \"huge\" portions, however, I consider the portion size pretty normal. We get more when we order from Szechuan in Mesa.

Overall, the food was OK. Would I go back? Perhaps. I would rather place an order at Szechuan which is 20 minutes from our house, and make the drive, or drive to Tempe and eat at Thai Basil. This is surely not the best Thai food in AZ. I think if this had been my first experience with Thai, I would have been disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely love coming to Thai Paradise!  Owner is so friendly, and a wonderful chef!  The Tom Ka soup is my favorite.....flavorful, rich and delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out and received no condiments or sauces ! This was upsetting, as the dishes were a bit dry. The man working there claimed he did not have any sauces nor any fried tofu, which was quite baffling. The food was not bad but we ordered tofu pad Thai and received chicken in the dish. As a vegetarian, that was a bit disappointing :( Also the Thai tea was 99% ice."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband on a Thursday night around 7pm and there was nobody in the restaurant. Finally the owner emerged from the back and greeted us. We got water and placed our order quickly. We got the tom kha soup pot medium spicy and pad thai super spicy. The tom kha was good but way too lemony. I love sour and can handle super sour really well but this soup turned my stomach sour and was a little hard to eat because it was too lemony and needed to be slightly evened out with more coconut milk. The portion was good and there were huge pieces of thick cut chicken. The pad thai was also a really good portion and had good flavor. It wasn't too saucy and not too dry. The spice level was good and had a really nice spice to it. The pad thai also had a lot of chicken in it. The owner was super nice and friendly, he was a one man show! The food came out fast and overall good experience. We'll probably come back again"}
{"text":"Run for the door! Do not go here. This place is not authentic at all! I was looking forward to some good Pad Thai and instead I got some kind of sweet and sour noodles. Rude when i called and ordered too. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."}
{"text":"One man show indeed! 

The owner not only took our orders, but was our cook as well. I'll have to admit, I was really skeptical to go in since there was no one in the restaurant. But the four stars got us through the doors & the food & service is what will ensure we'll come back. 

The food was great, portions large, & well priced. We ordered eggrolls for appetizers but he only had four left, though they come in six. He offered two crab ragoon as a substitute. I've read in the reviews that he hasn't had a couple items on hand at times. That's usually a negative, but I don't let stuff like that trip me up when it comes to mom & pop stores. I'll definitely be back."}
