{"text":"Quick , fast,  and affordable... quiet environment  and friendly staff.  what I like is the ambience and the food... not authentic but still really tasty!!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna give it to you straight, fellow yelpers: if you're looking for incredible authentic Thai food, this isn't the place for you. However, if you're looking for affordable dishes within a larger than life menu, then this is totally the place for you.   Don't come here if you're absolutely starved as service can be slow at times (even with only two tables other than mine during my last visit)  Good food for the price,  but that's about it."}
{"text":"This isn't Thai food, it's Chinese pretending to be Thai..  Sweet and sour fish was loaded with thick corn starched sauce, curry chicken definitely not Thai whatsoever, papaya salad was just papaya and tomato and lemon that's it, missing a lot of other ingredients, Thai noodles were blah. It's obvious these people don't have a clue what Thai is nor do they care. Can't believe I ordered from here, just wanted to throw it all out as soon as I tried it."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai Food joint in Mississauga!! Located in the heart of Streetsville, I've always found the food delicious and the staff very hospitable! It's a family owned place and are truly authentic. Thumbs up for Jing Thai!! :)"}
{"text":"Craving for some Thai . . . Although not the most authentic but not bad . . . as there are no others in the area.  The good: pad thai, green curry and the satays.  The poor:  $8.00 for a small bowl of kung yum gong!  The food is always hot and service is usually quite quick."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time.  It was completely dead for a Friday lunch.  Food smelled funny, tasted funny, and I felt a bit sick after.  I'm not sure why it was ranked high on insauga.  I don't think the food was fresh.  Still feeling sick....."}
{"text":"Since the weather is still too cold for any fun time outdoor activities (DAMN YOU GROUNDHOG) my friends and I got together for a dinner and game night in Mississauga.  So I looked to the locals for some advice of where shall we eat and Jing Thai was suggested as a great inexpensive place for Chinese and Thai food.  So all 5 of us stuffed ourselves into a Ford Fusion and drove to Streetsville.  Now don't get me wrong, I had visions of a sterile small dingy room with fold up tables and chairs and was pleasantly surprised at the cozy dining room with nice wooden high backed chairs and linen tablecloths and napkins.  First impressions were nice. The menu was huge!  We each ordered a dish to share Family Style.  Our picks were Chicken Pad Thai (was okay), Ginger Beef (flavorful), Beef with Broccoli (kind nondescript), Chicken Lemon Soo Guy (crispy and delicious sause), Chili Chicken (perfect amount of heat for us wimps), and Sticky Coconut Thai Rice (yum)  With drinks it all came to about $15 bucks each.  A lot cheaper than an All you can eat place and we were all sufficiently stuffed.  So not a bad place for those on a budget looking for a decent meal."}
{"text":"Jing Thai is a place I frequently go to for good quality thai food in a good atmosphere.  The prices are below what you would expect for an establishment of this quality.  What you get is great thai food, in a comfortable classy atmosphere, for the same prices you would pay at one of the rushed restaurants in Chinatown.  I have eaten here at least 20 times."}
{"text":"Went once with my family when I was 18 and the food was okay. Then decided to go back again during my highschool lunch break with some friends and the owner blocked the entrance into the restaurant and told us \"go to pizza pizza or something\" just because of our young age. Age discrimination. Disgusting management/owner. Will never go again or recommend this terrible place to anyone."}
{"text":"I went to a deli in streetsville to grab a Burek, but they were sold out, as I walking by this place to my car, I was like lets grab something to go, I walk in, and I was greeted by a gentleman, I looked through their menu ( typical Thai menu ) I ordered Green Curry and Chicken fried rice.  Green Curry- 3/5 Chicken fried rice 3/5  it was decent nothing special, and the damage was around $18+   Note: They accept Visa."}
{"text":"Me and my wife's first visit to this place. Ordered calamari which was just perfect with the sauce. The Thai Chlli Fish along with the mixed veg fried rice was good with not too much of spice. My wife ordered the coconut rice for desert and loved it with the pieces of mango in it. The ambience is decent with no extras and the staff especially (the lady serving) very courteous and accommodative. Very happy with the price too."}
{"text":"Great place. Love the location on Queen Street. Food is decent quality and portions are large. I recommend any of the combos, which are really good value for money.   I eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"This is a textbook 3 star place. You know the seasoning won't be as authentic or strong when a place offers both Thai and Chinese.   We had basil chicken and pad thai. I must be spoiled by better Thai places in Toronto like Eat BKK or even salad king. Cause there is a noticeable lack of kick to their spice. It tastes kind of like Chinese stir fry dishes.   it's not bad. It's certainly edible. Just not something I would go out of the way for. There aren't many good options for Thai in Mississauga so..."}
{"text":"Do not go here for Thai food! Zero authenticity. Restaurant is dark and stuffy. Got the seafood pad Thai for lunch. It was quick since there were 2 customers at the restaurant. Staff was friendly. Good portion. Unfortunately most of it was uneaten since the flavour was lacking big time."}
{"text":"I like the ambiance here. It has an upscale feel and the food is priced reasonably. The spicy chicken noodles are very tangy and the fried chicken dishes are really juicy too. The food is not super authentic though, but still quite tasty. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great place for Thai and Chinese food in Streetsville. Food was good and very friendly and courteous staff."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch after parking a bit too far away from the place we were initially heading to-- Jing Thai was the halfway point between our car and the other restaurant, so we decided to step in after checking the menu really quickly.  The menu is absolutely huge, but we ordered one of the lunch specials (they end at 3PM) from the Chinese section of the menu. We each got the first one, which consisted of 4 sweet and sour chicken balls, some chicken chow mein, chicken fried rice (my boyfriend paid a dollar extra for noodles on his), and an egg roll. I also decided to get two Thai spring rolls since my boyfriend hadn't tried rice paper rolls before.  We got our rolls first, after only waiting a few minutes. Both came with the same sauce, which was a little disappointing because I was expecting a peanut sauce for the rice paper roll, but it was fine. The rice paper roll had carrots, which I've never seen incorporated before, but I thought it was quite yummy. My boyfriend loved his egg roll, but I'm not a fan of Chinese 5-spice and I could taste it. Overall, though, the appetisers were good.  Our specials came out almost right after we finished the rolls, and the plates were overflowing with food. I was surprised at how much food we got since I've had specials at other restaurants and they were maybe half of what Jing Thai gave us. My boyfriend loved his noodles and his chicken balls, but felt that his chow mein tasted a bit fishy-- I didn't taste it, but I'm assuming it's the same chow mein I had on my plate and it tasted fine to me, he probably picked up on the fish sauce used to cook it. The sweet and sour sauce wasn't disgustingly sweet, and there wasn't too much on my plate which I appreciated. The fried rice wasn't dry, and everything tasted the way it was supposed to.   Our bill came out to 27 dollars, which is amazing considering how much we ate. Next time, we'll split a lunch special because we felt like we were going to explode after eating separately, so you might want to consider doing that too. We're definitely coming back, as the food was delicious and affordable, and the staff was so friendly. The interior was nice, too, there were linens and wooden tables and chairs, so it's definitely not just a take-away restaurant."}
{"text":"That may even be a stretch, as first off, not authentic.  It's possible their chef may be from Thai, but from our meeting last year, it was mostly spoken in Cantonese with him going back and forth to the kitchen lol.    Nothing memorable about the pad thai, though it was good value, recalled we weren't able to finish it.  Nice place though for meetings. Typical decor, not as slick or modern as to the newer ones out there.  The cashier/hosting station on the left when you walk in is as nice as it gets. Actually a bit run down.    But friendly service.    Lots parking in this big plaza."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and the Thai selection is pretty good. But the Chinese food there is not the best.. Recently got take out, which included kung pao chicken, stir fry veggies with shrimp, and deep fry shrimp. Somehow it all tasted the same and quite salty. In hindsight, we shouldn't have gotten Chinese food from a Thai place, so if you end up trying this place, just something to keep in mind. I remember the papaya salad to be quite tasty."}
{"text":"Very good prices, and pad thai done right. Friendly, quick staff, with a very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch since it's close to home and was featured on insauga as one of the top 5 thai in Mississauga.  The pros are that the restaurant is pretty nice inside for a thai place and the service was prompt. The prices on the lunch specials were also great The cons are the quality of the food. I don't have tons to go on, just the spring rolls (pretty good in both taste and size), thai green curry (mediocre and looked reheated), and the pad thai (below average). I usually judge a new thai place on their pad thai and this pad thai was very very sweet. I would definitely stick to Bamboo Legend for pad thai. And curry for that matter.  Just a quick note that we were the only patrons in the restaurant for our entire lunch, though we did go at 2pm (lunch specials run until 3pm by the way). I will also note that though the spring rolls were piping hot, both the curry and the pad thai may have been reheated as they were not \"hot\" when served."}
{"text":"Service Friendly staff. There were 2 servers looking after us. We always got what we asked for right away and never ran dry as far as water or drinks were concerned.   Food  Food was okay. I will think it was better in my previous visits. The curry was good, it would be a 10/10 if it was a little spicier. Nothing a side of hot sauce couldn't fix. Unfortunately I can't say the same for the pad Thai. It was soggy and all lumpy. I definitely had better.   Environment  Restaurant was clean and cozy. Plenty of parking.    I would go back, the food is normally pretty good."}
{"text":"Before I became a vegetarian, I literally ate here every Saturday night. The food was really really good - probably some of the best Chinese food I've had. Unfortunately the service wasn't too great - they constantly got our order wrong and weren't very friendly. However if you're looking for some good Chinese food that delivers/does take out, this is probably the best place in Streetsville!"}
{"text":"Great place and value! Generous  portions usually we go there and try different things because it's nice to try the menu items family style. Our favorites are their Chilli chicken, red curry chicken and basil chicken goes so well with just steamed jasmine rice @.@"}
