{"text":"I have no idea where Sushi Seoul comes from. This place doesn't serve sushi. Its name is actually Shin Chon. It's a Korean restaurant inside a small plaza just north of Yonge/Steeles. The signs outside mentions \"Chinese\" but I don't even see any Chinese food or Chinese Korean food anywhere on the menu. It's just a standard Korean place with one special thing going for it: $10 AYCE pork belly. Of course, they have a ton of standard Korean dishes too if you don't want pork belly.

I'm very fortunate to have Korean friends. The $10 AYCE pork belly special is not listed anywhere on the menu. My friend found this place on a Korean website and discovered the special that way. This is probably the cheapest AYCE dinner, ever. Yes it's all you can eat and it comes with side dishes and 2 refills. 

There isn't much to write about in terms of quality for the pork belly. They give you some raw pork and you grill it yourself using a standard gas tabletop stove. The side dishes were ok. Nothing stood out. It comes with a tofu stew. I felt they added too much black pepper to it. 

I'm not sure when the $10 AYCE pork belly special will expire so if you arrive and they don't have it, don't hate me. :)

I guess all these identity issues don't affect their business very much because most of their customers are Korean. They have English on the menu so language shouldn't be a problem. Recommended, especially for the AYCE pork belly. The next cheapest AYCE pork belly place charges $15. I can't think of a better deal in the area."}
{"text":"Whatever this place likes to call itself is their Business.
Did that make sense?  I guess depends the tone you read it.

Asking what Sea Squirt was isn't that ridiculous is it?
Never got an answer, she just waved us off it.  Fine.
Grilled Sea Eel, yeah?  It's next to the Sea Squirt.
WHY do I bother with special sections of Korean Menus?
I've learned my lesson!

Rice Porridge(appetizer)
     Yummy Vegetarian/Carb Baby Food.  
     Here comes the plane. Open wide.

Hangover Soup (Haejangguk $6.99)
     New dish I've never met before or have I?
     Mild, too mild in spiciness and Soup base. 
     Massive GARLIC proportion seemed to be the star.
     At least after the Meal was finished.   ;D

Grilled Fish ($10.99)
     3 head-to-tail Fish(Small Yellow Corvina)
     How come it looks like it's Pan-fried?
     It was golden crisp skin and perfectly tasty."}
{"text":"Decent, affordable food,but slow service (very understaffed).  Owner castigated (screamed)  employees in front of the entire restaurant. For that reason,  will not return."}
{"text":"Came towards the end of the dinner rush. We got seated at a reasonable time but where we were sat had different flooring that was very slimy, most likely from the oils drippings from the table top bbq. 

Our initial food order came out quick. We ordered the pork belly bbq combo which came with 4 beers, a decent order of meat, soybean paste stew, rice and sides (banchan, lettuce, garlic, green onion mix) all for the letrce wrap for under $35.00. Pretty good price for Korean bbq combo. 

Throughout the meal. We had a hard time getting the waitresses attention. They are understaffed, typical for a Korean restaurant. So service was not something I would praise them for. We paid the bill and was ready to leave and all of a sudden we heard yelling behind us. It was the owner yelling at the top of his lungs at one of the waitresses in Korean. She had made some type of mistake and he was furious and didn't have the decency to take her to the back or aside somewhere away from the customers. It was quite upsetting for all the patrons that were just staring at this man yelling at his staff member.  

Because of the end experience I will not be going back. It was unnecessary, unprofessional..... just akward and quite sad. I felt bad for the waitress and the customers. It just put a bad feeling to all of our evening."}
{"text":"AYCE pork belly meal is at $14 per person as of Sept 2014.  Meal includes pork belly, side dishes, tofu soup, rice and lettuce.  Everything tasted standard.  Seatiing is cramped and not comfortable.  Services depends on if you speak either Korean or Mandarin.  If none, you can't communicate with any of the wait staff.  Strangely, this does not offend me, because their focused clientele is Korean.  The printed menu is bilingual, but the menu posted on wall is in Korean only and have no picture."}

Sushi Seoul is really Shin Chon?!

Shin Chon has some identity crisis...

The sign and their receipt has Shin Chon listed as Sushi Seoul.. but there is no sushi on the menu...

The Chinese words at store front stating that Shin Chon is a special Chinese take out place, but I found nothing Chinese on the menu. The only Chinese element I encountered was the waitress who only speaks Mandarin and Korean. 

As usual, my Yelp Friend was trying to find some strange and unique item... Sea quirt? What is sea squirt?? Our waitress could not explain to us either in English or Mandarin..... 

The waitress insisted that we don't want to eat Sea Quirt nor we would like the Grilled Sea Eel.. which are under the special..... so reluctantly, we ended up ordering

Hangover Soup ($6.99) was not too spicy though it looked red. A good amount of beef tendon and one would love it if you are into garlic. I think my Friend still has a hangover after almost finish the whole soup...

Grilled Fish ($10.99) was 3 small fish grilled whole with all the internal organs. The skin was grilled crispy and the taste quite savoury. I have the urge to have some Soju while eating them....

Lunch Specials always available on some of the dishes, which cost $1 or so less.

Closed on Monday.... (Korean Signs posted every where even inside the washroom... which I finally find out by asking one of the waitress....)"}
