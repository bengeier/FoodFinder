{"text":"Loved it . You get your money's worth and more. I have been there twice gotten gyros . and baklava everything's been great try it you'll like it"}
{"text":"Great price for great food. Just what the area needed! Now instead of waiting til the Greek food festival you can get it all year long! Very nice staff and quick service!"}
{"text":"Surprised! I wouldn't have eaten gyros from a place in Penn Hills but my friends dragged me in. I would be missing out on the best gyros in the city!

Let me just say I left stuffed. Their basic gyro and fries meal is more than enough to fill you up and it's only $8! It was delicious and the gyro sauce was fresh and clean tasting. Grape leaves were good and the fries had a great seasoning. My only regret is I didn't buy the hummus, which I was told is homemade. 

I'll be back and I'll recommend it easily. Keep the menu simple and fresh please!"}
{"text":"I've gotten a gyro there a few times.they put lots of meat.the sauce isn't bad.but they only put tomatoes and red onion.i like a gyro with lettuce,tomato,onion diced.the sauce makes the gyro.I'm still looking for a good gyro place."}
{"text":"You better have a big appetite for this big boy! Very generous portions and very tasty! There was a lot of gyro meat hiding the yogurt sauce, tomatoes, onions and pita bread! Plus the fries were done just right - light and crispy, the way I like them! My tummy said yummy! :)))"}
{"text":"SO good. I love it. I'm a vegetarian and their veggie options are delicious."}
{"text":"Outstanding Gyros!

I love gyros! My favorite place is Steve's up in Cleveland. When I can't make the 2 hour trip up there I go to Old Village Grill on Saltsburg Road in Penn Hills. The meat portions are large with more than enough meat for two gyros. Their options for gyros include (Authentic) a mixture of lamb and beef, (Souvlaki) marinated skewed pork and Chicken.

They also offer greek salads, Hummus, Dolmage (stuffed grape leaves), Spanakopita (Fillo dough stuffed with Spinach and Feta cheese and Tiropita (Fillo dough stuffed with a blend of cheeses. For dessert they offer Baklava and Rice Pudding. They have party trays for your next event as well.

There are everyday specials like a gyro, fires and a drink for $7.99 or 2 gyros for $10. They do offer a few tables if you can't make it home and want to eat in. They even offer free wifi and take PayPal.  

Get here now!"}
{"text":"OMG this a gem of a restaurant!  The gyro meat was tender and savory!  The sandwich is overstuff and perfectly complimented.  Don't snooze on the this little spot."}
{"text":"Whenever you're talking \"gyros,\" some mouth-breathing yinzer will undoubtedly mention the South Side's Mike & Tony's.  Mike & Tony this.  Mike & Tony that.  Mike & Tony hit me with a wiffle ball bat.  I spent two whole years after college living in the slums of Pittsburgh's South Side, doing my post-graduate work in hard liquor and fatty foods.  Mike and Tony know what they're doing; their gyros are good.  Old Village Grill's are perfect, though.  Everything's seasoned to perfection.  The toppings are fresh.  The sauce is great.  Old Village is, in my opinion, far superior; maybe the best gyro place in the area.  Aside from their gyros, the other food they offer is great, too.  Their chicken gyros are - and I never thought I'd say this - just as good as their traditional ones.  They also have several vegetarian options that are great.  

It's a family-owned business.  The old guy running the joint is as nice as they come.  If I had ONE bone to pick with the place (and I'm really searching here) it's that the gyro is arguably too big.  I'll sometimes have to pick a quarter of the meat off of it before I even attempt my first bite.  Still, that's not a terrible problem to have.  Anywho... go spend some of your money there so it stays open, please."}
{"text":"I got the Greek salad with pita. Romaine and veggies were super fresh. Greek dressing paired perfectly with it and the warm pita finished the dish. Great for takeout. Quick, friendly service and fair prices."}
{"text":"Not very good food, the portions were ok but the meat was off both in color and taste, and was quite greasy.  The cucumber sauce was not that good either."}
{"text":"This place never lets us down!   Great value, friendly service.  Make sure you order extra sauce because it's so good.   I used to live close by, but now I'm 45 minutes away.  When I stop, I have them wrap everything separately so it doesn't get soggy."}
{"text":"I love a good Gyro !  I like the Gyros at the Old village Grille. We usually eat in at the few tables available, but we also take out.  I prefer to eat in. Some Gyros don't travel well. They make a very good Gyro for the area. The meat is sliced  from the spit. The vegetables are always fresh. I have never had a bad Gyro from The Village Grille. They do offer coupon specials if you can find them. They do have lunch time specials as well. I like that they have a kids meal special that you can purchase for the little ones that can't eat a whole Gyro. You don't have to pay full price for the little ones that don't eat much other than the meat.  I think the prices are very reasonable for what you receive. Next time I would like to try the Greek Salad w added Gyro meat."}
{"text":"Growing up in Buffalo, every diner was a greek diner.  You could always gt souvlaki and gyros.  When I moved to Pittsburgh I was shocked to learn this was a regional thing.  I had no idea good greek food would be so hard to find in Pittsburgh!  There are gyros everywhere but not as many options for souvlaki, grape leaves or other treats.

I learned of Old Village Grill when I had their baklava at a party I was at.  The hostess mentioned it was from a new(ish) greek place in Penn Hills.  I was intrigued so I went to check it out the next day.  The menu is fairly small, but that is fine because everything they do they do extremely well.  You can get entrees (which include Gyro, grilled chicken or souvlaki) on their own or as part of a combo with fries and a salad. They also have sides like grape leaves, spanakopita and hummus.  Gyro portions are extremely large and the meat is very tasty and tender.   But whatever you order, you won't be disappointed.  Everything is fresh and flavored and spiced wonderfully.

Inside there are a few tables for dine in, but it is mostly a take out venture.  Your best bet is to call ahead to avoid a wait, but even walking in the wait time isn't that bad.

Check for coupons as there have been some in the Clipper Magazine.  They also have a loyalty card which is punched every time you buy a Gyro.  A great way to save if you intend to be a frequent visitor.  I'm glad I discovered this gem fairly close to home."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here :) I heard around town that this place had awesome gyros so decided to give it a try!
Literally I usually eat a gyro once a year mainly at the Oakmont Greek Food Festival due to I could never find a good gyro else where. Well now I have!
I ordered the Hercules Gyro which is huge the thing can easily feed 2 maybe 3 people it's loaded with big slices of meat along with fries that have a nice seasoned zing to them (not hot at all). Trust me I'm not dainty girl when it comes to digging in with my hands and getting messy to eat but I had to eat this with a fork and knife bc it was so loaded I couldn't even pick it up! The flavoring was very distinct it has the same ole \"gyro\" fast but there is something more to it that makes it unique and you can tell it's home made  from a family recipe.
I also ordered a spanicopita ( hope I spelled it right ) it had a nice flaky crust along with a strong spinach flavor. Cooked very good but nothing to lnow me away. I also notice do they have other goodies there that I will most defined to be trying in the future! Only thing somewhat negative I have to say is I wish I had more sauce on my gyro but you can buy extra if you want, which I should of"}
{"text":"Very rude. First time in didn't greet me had a attitude the whole time taking my order. I was unfamiliar with menu and asked for something incorrectly and the guy became very agitated. To where I had to walkout the restaurant and not even get anything."}
{"text":"One of the few places east of Pittsburgh that makes quality gyros. Their portions are more than generous and the quality is outstanding."}
{"text":"If you can't go to Greece for gyros, go here instead. If you can go to Greece for your gyro fix, consider going here first. They're that good.
     The gyros are huge, the sauce is tasty, the meat; zesty. The service is friendly, and, Bob, the price is right. I keep coming back to this place because of the outstanding food and value, you really shouldn't miss out."}
{"text":"Visiting friends in Penn Hills we decided on Greek take out, instead of the usual Friday night pizza. Several had tried the Old Village Grille before and had very good reviews. We ordered a variety of dishes: Greek Salads, Dolmades, Spanakopitas, Tiropitas, (a cheese/egg mixture \"spanakopita\"), Authentic Gyro Platters, Veggie Gyro Platter and Souvlaki Gyro Platter (which in this case is Pork instead of Lamb or Beef). Everything was absolutely fabulous; not a single negative comment about anything, except the person who ordered Souvlaki didn't know it was pork (his fault not theirs). 
The food was all prepared while we waited, the staff was friendly and helpful, the establishment is clean, the prices are very reasonable, the recipes are authentic (a Greek owned family business), it's easy to get to and parking is accessible. There are only a few tables in the front, it is a converted Dairy Queen, so I won't comment on eating in rather than take out.
It simply everything you could want in a take out style Greek restaurant.
5 stars. Definitely will revisit."}
{"text":"IF this was my first visit, I would not go back. New cook, regular cook on vacation, sandwich half the size as usual. Pita was not heated and meat was luke warm, I guarantee it was below legal temp. I even heard others asking to have meat put on grill to warm it up as they said meat is never hot. My 80 year old mother who has never been able to eat the whole combo was still hungry after finishing her meal. While watching cook prepare gyro, I commented that she puts much less meat on than usual and she said owner instructed her to make them that way. IF this continues, OVG WILL BE DOA"}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food and great ownership. Will definitely come again! Thank you for your business."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch last week. The prices are good and it is a good lunch or take out atmosphere. There are about 5 tables and a counter to order at. I got a gyro and it was very good. One thing my fiancé liked was they do not skimp on the meat. For me it was too much and I felt wasteful but it depends on what you like. All ingredients were fresh and I would go back again. Next time I'll order the gyro salad I saw it on my way out and it looked really good!"}
{"text":"Awsome! We did the 2 for $10.99 gyros.  They put so much meat on the gyro that 2 gyros would be enough for 4.  Don't pass up on this place located in Penn Hills.  I cant wait to go back and try something else."}
