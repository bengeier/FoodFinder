{"text":"On a Sunday afternoon, only 5 tables occupied. Service was quick but just that, service! no small talk, just take the order, get the drinks and wait. Small portions, a bit overpriced, and not the best food I have had, miss the Hard Rock downtown! Better atmosphere, better prices, bigger portions, and BETTER FOOD!!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good however the prices are high. Waitress did a great job until she asked if I needed change."}
{"text":"After studying the lunch menu I decided on the pulled pork bbq sandwich. Wow...it was bad. The pork was not firm at all. It was like mush. It had a whitish coloring to it like it was pig fat. I could of ate it without teeth by gumming it. Nasty."}
{"text":"OK...this is not a gourmet restaurant.  We were there for a concert though and wanted to grab a quick bite to eat before it started.  We only had about 45 minutes so were a little concerned about having enough time but decided to try it.  It was a Thursday night so I'm sure not as busy as the weekend but still fairly busy.  We just ordered a large mixed appetizer plate and e couple of drinks.  The food wasn't bad at all and in fact, we really enjoyed it.  The service was fast and very friendly.  We would certainly go back.  In fact we went back after the concert because we saw that they had a live band that was really good so we went back and had another drink before heading home.  Not the BEST food I've ever had but certainly good enough if you are there and want to grab a fairly quick bite."}
{"text":"We couldn't even get in with our teenage sons. It's in the middle of the casino and there's no access for people under 21. Absolutely ridiculous that an establishment like Hard Rock Cafe would make their restaurant so inaccessible."}
{"text":"Had a great experience there tonight after the Bush concert. Was very impressed by the way our food came out. The presentation was flawless. Cooks looked like they were doing an awesome job being a former restaurant manager. Great job"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here 1/3/2014.  My friend got the Tupelo Chicken Tenders (on the appetizer menu) she loved the light breading  and the sauces.  I got the Filet of Fish Sandwich. I chose the grilled version- it was a very nice whitefish filet on a brioche bun.  We didn't try dessert or anything- maybe next time."}
{"text":"We went to the casino yesterday  to lose our hard earned  money and then to have lunch. We had 8 in our party and was seated promptly because  the restaurant  was empty. We ordered  our food which consisted of several  salads and sandwiches.  Our food arrived  after a half hour and I couldn't  figure out why, the place was empty. My salad order was not what I had ordered,  I wanted  the fried chicken  and not the cold,dry grilled chicken. When I politely  informed the waitress  about my salad she said,\" Well, that's what you ordered\"..She took it back for correction  and that took another  20 minutes. I finally got the dried cold overcooked chicken crumbles . The wilted brown lettuce and other salad mixing wasn't edible.  My sister order a different kind of salad and asked the waitress  for more salad dressing  and the servers told her that there was dressing  on the salad already. We were never asked if our food was okay ,which it wasn't  and we had to search  for catsup and mustard which we found at another table, we couldn't  find our waitress  though. The club sandwiches with cold dry bacon were tasteless and the cold greasy fries partnered well.  We had to ask for napkins several  times because  the sandwiches  fell apart as they we eaten. Well, I picked up the tab for my family which totaled $127.00 so my total loss for that day was $327.00 which included my gambling. I lost my ass off all around..oh by the way I didn't  eat my lousy salad either, when I got home we ordered  pizza and that was a winner."}
{"text":"At first I gave a 2 star I believe but had to give 5 because the issue with the employee was taken care of by the manager their self by calling me directly. Thank you for your service and caring about it."}
{"text":"Birthday time and after a couple hours of casino time we went into the Cafe for an early dinner. Our server was first class, and our food was perfect. She went above and beyond to be sure we were well taken care of. We enjoy the food at this quiet oasis on the midst of ringing bells and music coming from the slots."}
{"text":"The nacho platter was the best thing to ever happen to me. Ever. Not when I got married. Not when I bought my BMW. Not when I gave birth to my first child. No, these nachos topped all those experiences. I felt like my mind left my body the first bite I took into the cheese topped delicacy. I became a better person that day. That day I felt like I truly knew there was a God. The nachos believed in me...and I...believed in them. Even the explosive bowel movement that ensued after fulfilled me with a magical feeling that no one could top.   That song \"God gave me you\" totally written about these nachos."}
{"text":"First, the food is 'ok'.  We had burgers and a pulled pork sandwich after waiting 45 minutes for our food.   However, the margaritas that were suggested were awful.  First, I ordered frozen and another member of our party ordered on the rocks.  We got 2 frozen margaritas.  Both tasted as if they were watered down. As far as alcohol in the drink, it may have been in there but it was as if they filled it half with the mix and put water in to fill the glass.  Our waitress was kind enough to take them away.  I got one on the rocks and this time it again was awful.  Too much of the mix!  The other person in our party never got his drink because the bartender again made his frozen.   If you go on a Wednesday after 6 pm, order a beer."}
{"text":"Good food for a sit down restaurant at the casino. Prices were reasonable and the service was good. Great stop."}
{"text":"Subpar at best. The burgers are huge, but lack flavor for sure. This particular Hard Rock is just a small section of the casino, not its own restaurant. I collect the shot glasses, so it's the only reason I stopped. The service was pretty good, but the food is way overpriced. $14 for a bland burger and fries. The casino is nice though!"}
{"text":"Was there last Saturday - yes during the Blizzard!!!!  Did not have to wait for a table and was excited to eat there because we have ate at Hard Rock Cafe's before.  My husband got a burger - which he said was nothing exciting.  I ordered the 3 cheese pasta - the description on the menu sounded really good.  When they put the plate down in front of me the cheese sauce looked orange and I knew that meant one thing - cheese from a can - YUCK!!!!!!  It was terrible.  We did add on side salads which were the best part of our meals.  The meal cost us $60.00 and that was just with soft drinks.  A Lot of $$$$ for a bad burger and cheese from a can."}
{"text":"Worst hard rock I've ever been to, and I have been to a number of them, from the one in the Netherlands to the one in LA. We were told 10 minute wait, 25 mins later told it would be 15 additional minutes with no apology from the same hostess who told us 10. We left in a hurry after that. Avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"They don't allow kids which is odd. I wanted to take my family out to dinner and was stopped by security in the parking lot!! I don't really understand why my kids can't eat here? We won't be back. Other hard rocks allow kids. Booo"}
{"text":"I have so much to say about my awful experience here that I don't know where to begin.  I'm not a gambler, so my only reason for heading to the Rocksino was to see a comedy show. My fiance and I decided to grab a drink beforehand, and the bar at the Hard Rock Cafe in the center of the casino seemed alright, so we sat down there. There were quite a few barmaids working behind the bar but we were pretty much ignored for awhile. When someone finally came over to us she was f-bombing about something. I'm not delicate flower and swearing doesn't bother me that much, but throughout our entire time at the bar, this lady kept swearing at or about things pretty loudly. It was pretty awkward.  I ordered a mojito that tasted like rubbing alcohol and my fiance ordered a beer. As I was paying, our waitress asked us if we were there to see the comedy show and told us how she'd tried to get the featured comedian to let her sit on his face the night before. Again, super awkward. Then she made a joke about being hit on by old people and black people while working and made an \"eww\" noise and motioned towards the black couple sitting near us. Not cool, crazy barmaid. Not cool.  Maybe she was having a bad night? Maybe she's just a bad person? But either way, her attitude doesn't make me want to rush back and go to that bar or the Rocksino. I can't justify anything that she said, but I did feel bad for her because the other barmaids were primping and swooning over guys at the bar while she was making pretty much all of the drinks for the bar area and the dining section. But still...  If you want a terrible tasting drink and want to get offended by the wait staff, check this place out. Otherwise, AVOID!"}
{"text":"Food and service is outstanding.  The atmosphere is awesome. It is obvious the take time in detailing the training of their employees in both the back of the house as well as the front. Very impressed with their consistency of the quality."}
{"text":"Best meal I have had in a long time! My son loves the Rockcino (sp?). We got a booth for lunch by the bar. The two 'boys' got bbq sandwiches, while the ladies had Salmon with creamed spinach and onion rings and a side salad and side of mac & cheese. The boys loved the sandwiches and my fav raved about the beans on the side while my son loves how the coleslaw compliments the pulled pork. The mac&cheese is cheesy, spicy goodness! The salmon was perfectly cooked and so tasty. The creamed spinach: amazingly tasty way to eat your veggies. With a full bar, friendly, staff and casino vibe we had tasty, enjoyable lunch."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Entrees are over $20 but burgers are $14 and sandwiches are $12.  Atmosphere was beautiful and clean.   There was a band playing in the middle of café on a beautiful stage.   Apparently bands are free on Thursdays 6-8pm so it worked out good."}
{"text":"My meal was amazing. The server told me that they make all there burgers by hand. The food is so fresh and taste great. The Cobb salad is really good. I highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"Service is awesome friendly.  Never had a plate I or my wife did not like.   Portions are good sized.  Wife loves the fries.  Sandwiches and steak are all good. Note:  Try to sit on the stage when not in use it is much quitter."}
{"text":"I got a burger! cant believe they could mess up a burger like this. no seasoning and it was burned too. Anyway! Although we waited for a very long time, despite the fact that there were many empty tables, and our drinks came after our appetizer, I tipped them %15 which was very generous for what we got. I have the security alerts enabled on my credit card. So, I got an email about the money I spent at dinner. They increased the tip on my check!!!!!!! WTF!!!!! after calling and talking to the manager many times, one week later, he said: \"Oh, can you check your statement? it should be fixed. call me if it was not fixed!\" yeah! They corrected the amount to what I wrote on the check. Honestly, I wanted to get all of the tip back. they didnt deserve any of it. the management didnt even offer returning my tip or the whole thing! Dont you get it?!?! this is credit fraud. I should have canceled the payment on my credit card to begin with. DONT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!! you will regret it like me."}
{"text":"The management was terrible. The food was bland and I asked for medium rare and was given a near well done steak. The obese manager took about ten minutes to reach our table and I was disappointed when she did approach us about the low quality menu ."}
{"text":"Don't take your kids here. They won't let you go through the casino to get to any of the restaurants here unless you're 21 and over. We waited fifteen minutes for a table when more than half of them were empty. My friend's beer came out warm. The regular soda drinks are about as much as the beer, about $4. We literally looked at our food sitting on the ready table for about twenty minutes before it was brought over to us. It was busy at the restaurant, but the manager seemed to be doing all of the organizing and serving for the severs. The Mac n cheese I was excited to get, wasn't cheesy at all, the chicken was dry and unseasoned, and it had an overwhelming garlic taste. My friend's shredded pork burger was dry, even the sauce seemed dry, and the bun looked like it came out of a cheap package you would buy at a grocery store. I am so disappointed with the restaurant because the one I went to in Biloxi, MS was so good."}
