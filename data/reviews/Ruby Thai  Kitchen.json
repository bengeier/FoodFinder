{"text":"This place was just ticketed by public health inspectors!  * Ruby Thai Kitchen, FC01 - 17600 Yonge St., Newmarket, was cited for seven infractions, which were:  operating a food premise maintained in a manner permitting adverse condition affecting food; using non-corrosion-resistant utensils in contact with food; failing to protect food from contamination or adulteration; maintaining hazardous foods at internal temperatures between 4 C and 60 C; failing to ensure equipment surface was washed as necessary; failing to ensure the floor of a food-handling room was kept clean; and immersing utensils in chlorine solution of less than 100 parts per million of available chlorine."}
{"text":"Is it the best Thai or most authentic Thai or the cheapest Thai? No. But it's cheerful and tasty enough. Curries are great but could be spicier. Great staff."}
{"text":"I'm shocked this place doesn't have better reviews. It's one of the best food court easties I've been to. It's a hidden gem, and I can never figure out why it's so good compared to the thousands of comparable places in malls and offices across the region.  The Thai Noodles are amazing--unlike the flavourless plastic at similar locations, the noodles are fresh and bursting with flavour, being lightly marinated makes all the difference. These are the only food court asian noodles I not only eat without soy sauce, but would never imagine of putting sauce on, they're so delicious.  The bang bang chicken (fried, spicy sauce) is great, but recently I've discovered the Basil Beef (extremely spicy sliced beef) which is amazing! The honey grilled chicken is also great.  Really nice staff, too, and highly efficient/quick. Their cashier is quick and amazingly Apple Pay/tap works on their credit card machine flawlessly and instantly every time (tap debit has issues, credit is perfect). I almost never eat elsewhere in the mall despite there being several other decent places.  Even other Ruby Thai Kitchens in Toronto are awful in comparison. I really wonder why it's so much better here--owners must really care about doing good work. Oh, and it's super cheap with HUGE portions--they absolutely pile on the food, I usually tell them to stop and they keep going, it's crazy!"}
{"text":"They just opened the new store as the mall has gone many renovations. It is much cleaner looking and the food selection is even bigger then before. The meal I got today was thai noodles and black pepper beef. It is a bit spicy and delicious. I highly recommend the beef as it is my favorite at this place. They even offer a special Chinese food now called and please excuse my terrible translation - cha siu bao. They are bbq pork buns that are so good !!!"}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars.   It's a good thing that I didn't read the only review for this place in the food court. Apparently, food violations were through the roof a few months ago.   Well, I'm here to tell you that I had a good experience. I normally do the teriyaki place, shawarma joint, or Cultures. What caught my eye here? Green beans.   I love green beans. I can eat them for months and be perfectly content. This place has the tastiest green beans with garlic I have had at a food court. Crunchy, garlicky goodness!  My noodles were more on the greasy side, though. The honey-glazed chicken was yummy. The food is on the saltier side. So, my can of Diet Coke wasn't good enough. I had to get another beverage at Starbucks to quench my thirst.   I'd l come back here again. It is obvious that health and safety improvements have been implemented. I'm fine hours after my meal! Come here for a fast meal that tastes decent.   (141)"}
