{"text":"Since I work close to this restaurant, I visit often. With the Habanero Mexican Grill only a few more miles away, it is always a tough choice in which to go. El Poblano's is not a fancy restaurant by any stretch of the imagination, but if you are looking for great tasting food and very reasonable prices, by all means check them out.
My standard order is the Steak (Asada) Burrito which I have never been disappointed with. 
I have had the el Pastor tacos and burrito which I always consider when making my choice, the tacos especially are good.
A few weeks ago I did go outside the box and ordered the enchilada, it only comes with chicken and I was a bit disappointed. The chicken was very dry and the sauce was less than desirable, but it all in all was edible just the same. Just not the quality I have come to expect from them.
I could make a meal out of the chips and salsa, yes the chips are not fresh, but tasty, and today I tried the hot salsa, YUMMY!!
In the spring and summer they also have buckets of tomatos and peppers along the outside of the building, and I would like to think they use these in their food. Great Idea-I stole it from them (the idea not the vegetables)

All in all I do enjoy going there and as any local business that is starting out, I hope they survive, and people discover this restaurant, service is great, food is excellent, and location location location!!

Oh as a side note-the bakery is awesome also!!! Got these huge cresent roll type things that are incredible for making a sandwich-light fluffy and extremely tastey!!!"}
{"text":"After I moved away from the downtown area to the east side I have been looking for a Mexican restaurant to replace La Hacienda to fulfill my Mexican food cravings. Unfortunately, my search still continues...

My girlfriend and I went on a hot summer night and there was no air conditioning at all. It was probably hotter inside than it was outside.

I ordered an asada burrito (7.99) and my girlfriend ordered the enchiladas (7.99). The burrito came alone on a plate and was decently sized and my girlfriend's enchiladas came with beans and rice; a full plate of food. I was hopeful at this point because the chips and salsa that had come free with the meal seemed to be made in-house. However, when I took a bite of the burrito I was let down. 

The flavor of the asada just wasn't there, which in my opinion, is one of the largest factors that makes or breaks a burrito. It was not seasoned well. Upon closer examination of the meat, it looked like they just molded ground beef into larger chunks and tossed it on the grill.

My girlfriend's enchilada was equally disappointing. She said it was dry and tasted like frozen chicken she had eaten at home. It was also not seasoned enough.

To be fair, I thought the beans and rice that came with the enchilada were on point, although I found it odd that the rice had corn mixed in with it.

All in all, I don't think I will be coming back to El Poblano any time soon."}
{"text":"Tried this place last summer in an attempt to end a bout of Chipotle-going.  Yeah, I drank the Chipotle koolaid for a bit (I'm better now, thanks).  Anyway, I read all the great reviews of Poblano and went for some takeout.  Read that the owner came from Tex Tubbs (which we love) and hoped for great food in a more authentic Mex style.

What we got was little tacos made of dried-out tortillas, filled with dry and chewy fillings.  I was the only one in there, the dining room was totally empty, yes, right at dinner-time, and it STILL took them something like 20 minutes to put my order together.  The whole time, I felt like I was interrupting them by ordering, one of my real pet peeves about any business.

We had, as I recall, the El Pastor, the Chorizo, the Asada, and a veggie taco.  All the meats were rubbery and dry, and the tortillas tasted a week old, stale and lifeless.  Good thing I asked for hot sauce before I left.  I ended up using all of it just to moisten the damned things.

I highly doubt I will ever go back.  I gave two stars because the onions and cilantro were good!"}
{"text":"Loved this little Mexican bakery and resturant! The blackened fish taco was delicious and the staff were all very friendly and eager to help. Even though I was so full I could burst it was still fun to check out the little bakery and of course I had to take a few treats home for later. I live on the east side and El poblano will be my go to Mexican resturant now."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoyed having atole de coco and delicious tamales . It reminded us of being in our pueblo in mexico. I totally recommend it!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican place in Madison. I've had a lot of things on the menu and always satisfied 
I added photos of the menu, since it was not posted. 

Best horchata"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Would highly recommend to everyone who likes Mexican food. Yummmmmm I love it"}
{"text":"Please check this place out! The food is excellent; fresh and full of flavor. The servers are helpful and kind, super nice to kids and when I went there on my birthday they presented me with a muffin and candle! Prices are on the low side, when I told my kids we were going to the \"restaurant next to Woodmans\" they got super excited, they love the chimichangas which are delicious but only an occasional treat for our family :) Hope they stay in business. 
Oh, and they have a beautiful mural!"}
{"text":"I've ate here many times and it's never disappointed. I just tried the tostadas today with chorizo and found my new favorite item on the menu. Definitely one of the best meals I have had in some time."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly staff.  Nice bakery selection too."}
{"text":"We had the fried zucchini, pollo, chorizo and pork tacos and they were all excellent! Good price, friendly staff and some of the best tacos in town. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego so I'm kinda a stickler for good Mexican food. El Poblano is on par with any taco shop in SD, which means its incredibly good. Definitely the best Mexican food I've had since moving to Wisconsin."}
{"text":"I love this place. No frills setting, but homey, inexpensive, and the food is so very good. I often stop on my way to or from Woodman's. 

You will get free chips and salsa with your meal. All three salsas are delicious--two reds and a green. They usually bring out the mild red one. It 's smoky, intriguing flavor puts all other mild salsas to shame. The hotter red and the green are also excellent.  All are fresh, made there.  

My favorite lunch is the free chips and salsa and a blackened tilapia taco. It comes in a double soft corn tortilla shell with a spicy mayonnaise sauce, pickled vegetable slaw and avocado slice on top. A little spicy for me, but I can never bring myself to order one of the milder alternatives. 

The chicken enchilada dinner is fabulous, although the portion is huge. 
It's three enchiladas with a high quality chicken and cheese filling covered with salsa and a lattice of sour cream. Delicious refried beans and Mexican rice come with it. Makes for wonderful leftovers the next day.  

The owner is is almost always there. If she's around, she will check on you and make you feel welcome. The seating, lighting, etc. could be spiffier, but this is a home-away-from-home destination for comfort food at its very best."}
{"text":"Decent tacos for Madison. The menudo is a bit spicy for my liking. They do $1 Tacos on Tuesday, which is a sweet deal."}
{"text":"I am from Los Angeles, and this place is the closest to quality of LA. Mexican food I've found."}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful. I usually order the tostadas with the fried zucchini instead of meat (they have great vegetarian options-- not just beans!) which is so delicious and satisfying. Their homemade salsa is perfectly spicy with a hint of garlic which is a little different. It's a family owned and run restraunt and everyone is friendly and helpful. Great place!"}
{"text":"This is  my favorite authentic Mexican restaurant in Wisconsin. They have $1 tacos on Tuesday and Thursday, which is great if you're ballin on a budget like me. They're super tasty and fresh. The physical restaurant is nothing fancy, but who cares if you're stuffing yourself for $3."}
{"text":"First time trying out Mexican Cuisine here and we fall in love in it. 

The atmosphere is good and it's Sunday and some music performers from church came in and sang some songs for us. Nice to know it.

Salsa is good, spicy enough and nomnom"}
{"text":"Located right next to Woodmans east this little eatery/bakery has everything you need to fill your Mexican fix. 

We got the steak burrito, blackened talapia taco, fried talapia taco - add avocado,  and flan for $16.

The burrito was filed with pinto beans, rice, and tender, flavorful pieces of steak. It came with sides of hot salsa which kicked the flavors up a notch. This burrito hit the spot and I'd definitely get it again. 

The tacos were on 6\" corn tortillas. They both contained delicate pieces of dish and each with the hot salsas. The blackened talapia came with slaw and beans, while the fried had lettuce, onions, and cilantro.  Both were awesome,  but I think I'd favor the fried more. 

They also had a display of colorful bakery items and cakes. 

I'd suggest this place to anyone who wants fresh, authentic,  Mexican on the cheap!"}
{"text":"Awesome! The food here is super good! I had the chicken quesadilla and my wife had the chicken burrito. We split the guac... Everything was great! I would eat here again in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"This is a Mexican restaurant located in the same building as the Pan and Pan Mexican Bakery (http://www.panypanwi.com/) and in the same shopping center as the Woodman's East grocery store.  We love to go here before going grocery shopping.  The week-end is the best time to go because they have some fabulous specials.  Be certain to ask for them.  The Posole is absolutely amazing.  Definitely ask for the salsa verde.  The fish and shrimp tacos are delicious.  Seriously, the shrimp is cooked perfectly nearly every time I order them. The avocado slice and pickled onion strips add a lot of flavor.  The Quesadillas are not your typical version.  Each order comes with a type of filling along with diced red pepper and jalapeno.  Vegetarians have an option of fried zucchini and yellow squash as a taco, burrito, quesadilla, and torta filling.  For the omnivore crowd, all of their pork dishes are delightful.  Oh, and it is extremely affordable.  
By the way, this restaurant is also reviewed under the name of La Joya Mexican Restaurant but when we asked the owners, we were told it is called El Poblano.

{"text":"I had some delicious lamb tacos here. The couple times I've been they had several interesting specials and protein offerings you probably won't find at other Taco places in the area. Very casual and inviting atmosphere. I've also had their tamale's at an event on the square, and in the words of culinary luminary Guy Fieri, they were \"out of bounds\"!"}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant just about every week for lunch as I work just down the road.  It is definitely in the top 5 Mexican restaurants in Madison if not the top.  It's truly authentic, tasty, and cheap.  You definitely get more than you pay for.  

Maria, I think she is one of the owners if not the owner, knows what my fiancé and I want every time we go in and greats us like family. 

The great food and superb service...and hopefully future liquor license (can't wait for their margaritas) gives this family friendly place 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way to the Dells.  Three of us ordered steak tacos (only $2 each!) and the other ordered the chicken Mole.  We rolled out of there raving about the food.  The free chips and salsa (salsa was excellent) was a nice surprise.  So too was the high fructose free Coke.  Service was great, and you can tell the waitress cares about the customers and the quality of food they serve.  If you are hungry and driving by Madison on I39/94, make the detour to El Poblano, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My favorite no frills Mexican in Madison. 

Some variety in the salsa bar would be appreciate but both the mild and hot are great made in house salsas. 

Chips seem to be unlimited and are included with the order of any entree. 

Tacos and burritos are all good, and the mole plates and platters are great. 

I try to do quick woodmans runs over lunch to avoid the crowd, and this is a nice pre or post shopping meal."}
{"text":"$20.55 
Yep, doesn't sound remarkable but that bought us a bowl of guacamole, chips, salsa, 3 tamales, 3 tacos, one beer, one bottled water. Two of us were very full and food was yummy. Great service in a fast food like setting. Had no room for any bakery items but they smelled delicious. Recommend."}
{"text":"Some great fresh salsa and tons of food for low cost. Authentic and delicious. Waiter explained the menu very well also. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Honestly the best fish tacos I have ever had in my life. The decor is a little dingy but the food and service more than make up for it. There is also a bakery attached so the whole place smelled fantastic. You can also get Mexican coke in glass bottles, which is way better than the stuff sold in the US."}
{"text":"Never go to Woodman's East hungry. First have a blackened fish taco from El Poblano, located right in their parking lot. The fish is well seasoned and moist. The toppings include fresh avocado so the taco is creamy and delicious. The restaurant is co-located with bakery Pan y Pan. Their food is fabulous and very reasonably priced. Whatever you spend you will save when shopping!

You can eat or take out. My routine includes eating in the car while I finish making my list. i always need extra napkins."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Madison. Fresh, authentic, and delicious! Don't let the exterior of the building deter you- this is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Talk about a hidden gem in plain sight! I'm pretty much at the grocery store next door every week, and I tried this place for the first time last week..and all I have to say is OHMYGAWD!!! I had a chorizo torta and Mexican street corn, and it was a party in my mouth. The chorizo was cooked perfectly, and the portion size was massive! I had half the sandwich, and shared the other half with a friend who was equally impressed. The corn was just as amazing, I wish I had gotten more. 

I wish I had known about this place a lot sooner. The woman behind the counter was quiet, but friendly and attentive. She apologized that my order had taken so long, but I didn't mind at all. I enjoy all the baked goods near the window, but I do wish there were labels to distinguish what everything is (for the newbies like myself). I love that the menu is simple, but I feel that things could be organized just a little better. There are random signs everywhere for specials and various options that aren't on the menu, so it can be a little overwhelming.

Overall, menu was good, service was great, and food was incredible."}
{"text":"This is not a fancy joint by any means, but the food is on point!!  The tacos are amazing and legit. The chicken mole is by far my favorite!!!  I really don't know how to describe the flavors- you can taste the chocolate and spices, but it has something different than other moles... crack maybe?!!  There is almost like a little Asian fusion flavor going on here that makes me lick my plate every time!!!  Do yourself a favor and order some and give it a try for yourself."}
{"text":"Great little spot!! With quality and delicious Mexican food plus pastries. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"This is among the best in Madison. No lie.

I'd been turned onto this place by one of my coworkers and so I decided to get lunch and something to take to work later. I'll be back, 'cause I don't have an ounce of regret.

The building itself is pretty weird. It's an old Popeye's, so it's kinda got that fast food, counter service feel to it, but there's no menu visible when you walk in. The guy behind the counter (who, by the way, wasn't what I expected at all...he was a pretty cool stoner-looking dude) hands you a couple of menus and tells you to seat yourself.

There's coolers and cases everywhere where you can pick out donuts or cakes or rice pudding or whatever if you want too. Forgot that part.

The food I tried was beyond excellent.

I had the Poblano mole. The guy working there warned me (in a friendly way) that it's a pretty polarizing dish, but having liked moles in the past I pressed on. I guess you get a choice between bones or no-bones (I'm not sure if this is like...bone-in thigh drumstick versus boneless breast or if you ask for no-bones if they cut it up for you, didn't ask). I opted for the bones for no particular reason. 

The portion size was huge. I can't emphasize that enough. They served me the biggest chicken thigh and drumstick that I have ever seen. 

The sauce was great. Slightly sweet, the chocolate base really comes through. It was served with rice, beans, and a bunch of corn tortillas. Outstanding.

I got a couple of steak tacos to go which I had later at work. They were also outstanding. Just a touch of salt, cilantro, and onion. The sauce in the cups that were packaged with was a highlight. It's not particularly hot, but it has a peppery kick that I really like.

This place isn't for everyone, but those who like great Mexican food will really enjoy this place."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place more stars because the staff was extremely friendly and I was impressed by the authenticity of the menu and the speediness of the service however when the food arrived the Posole was very bland and the queso tasted like something that came out of a jar. I am going to come back another to try something else on the menu to see if I can improve this rating"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm a transplant from San Diego, Calif. and have been LONGING to find Mexican food in Madison to satisfy my carne asada cravings. El Poblano has come the closest! We ordered the carne asada tacos, asada burrito, horchata, flan, with chips and salsa. Totally hit the spot! We ordered for carry out--super fast and friendly service. Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Headed here because of other positive Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. As a home-grown, small town white chick, I can't verify the authenticity of the food, but it sure tasted good!

We have been there for lunch and for a quick dinner and both times it was not at all busy and we got our food right away. The atmosphere is super casual. If you are looking for someone to smile warmly and seat you upon entering you should pass on by, but if all you want is some cheap, quick, tasty food, you've found your place."}
{"text":"Ah what a great taco place. 

I got two tacos (pastor and asada) and a medium horchata. Chips and salsa were included because I was dining in. 

I'm dinging one star because the tortillas were a bit chewier than I prefer, and because the beef was a little dry. 

Tortillas were nice and warm, and the tacos were still overall tasty. Horchata was creamy and delicious. The lady who helped me was very friendly. There's a Pokéstop here, too, which was an unexpected bonus.

I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"This hole in the wall joint from the outside seems average. On this inside there is a spectacular bakery with a variety of baked goods, and one solid authentic Mexican restaurant. El Poblano has seating but in my opinion is not really a sit down restaurant. I prefer to do takeout. The staff is friendly and regardless of when we place a phone order they fail to give us a specific time for pick up, just a general \"in a little bit,\" so don't forget to ask for a time. The exterior could use some improvements - like removing the defunct drive through, but that is not enough to keep patrons from the authentic adventure that awaits inside. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and the Pico de Gallo is other worldly, so I always order extra."}
{"text":"Love it. I hail from the south side of Milwaukee, this reminds me of El Rey's Taqueria, which is a compliment. My favorite taqueria dish is Huaraches, and they make a damn fine one. I'm also a fan of their gorditas, and their tortas are the best in Madison. Family owned, the food is made fresh to order. The hot sauce is awesome by the way. If you eat in you get chips and salsa, but they're totally cool with take out. Outstanding, and conveniently in the Woodman's parking lot, so stop in and grab some Negro Modelo and make an evening out of it."}
{"text":"Nice people. Nice bakery section. Good food. 

Ordered tacos pastor. Good portion for the price. On the sweet side tho - I like mine with more of a spicier bite. Garnished with cilantro and onions. 

Ordered Huaraches with asada. Masa is tasty - good balance of that savory and sweet. I wished it was pan fried a bit to give it that crispy surface with a chewy center. Plus it would bring out some nice color too. 
Asada is seasoned well - more on the peppery side than others. 

Shoulda checked if they got elotes. Damn."}
{"text":"We've been here several times, always tasty authentic Mexican food. The owner & staff are friendly & helpful. We enjoy their Carnitas, which is hard to find, and they only make it for Taco Tuesday, Saturday & Sunday. Don't forget to get some horchata"}
{"text":"Was looking for a Mexican place and came across El Poblano! There are a lot of things I love about this restaurant. I love that they have lots of different salsas to choose from. I also love that they make tortas, which are my favorite. The service is also incredibly friendly here. Finally, you can do take-out or sit-down, which is nice. My only recommendation would be that it would be nicer if the booths were more comfortable. Other than that, no complaints. Would recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Well my wife had the tacos and she doesn't like corn shells anyway so 2 stars for her... I had the fajitas and they were pretty good... I love the corn tortillas but double up cause they are fragile and will split...very tasty though... 

The place is different for sure... has baked goods and self service water and salsa... 

3 stars for me. 2 for the wifeeeee."}
{"text":"Had a chicken chimichanga, which was good but they overdid it a little on the queso sauce on top. Also ordered a side of Mexican street corn, which was one of the specials, and it was good. Ok service, but you have to get your own salsa, silverware and water. The corn also came very late, after I'd almost finished my chimi. 

Probably won't make any effort to return because there are better options for Mexican food in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Hallelujah - my search for the perfect taco on the East Side has finally ended. 

I ordered takeout from here after reading all of the positive Yelp reviews, and was so not disappointed. I got a few steak tacos with a side of rice and beans. When I went inside, the person at the counter was beyond friendly -- always a good start! My food was ready right on time and was still hot when I got home. There was an impressive selection of bakery items that I will likely sample next time. The freshness of the ingredients is what really makes El Poblano shine. I will definitely be ordering from here again (soon.)"}
{"text":"Homemade tortilla chips and perfect fish tacos. Excellent sauces.  Menu is not extensive but that's just fine. All are well executed items that will definitely keep us coming back. Casual, laid back ambiance with friendly staff. 

Don't forget to check out the bakery at the front of the place - amazing pastries and cookies."}
{"text":"Wow.  Second time there and they are so impressive.  Order a tostada, they make their own.  Fresh, hot, fried, delicious.

I had a steak quesadilla that was stuffed with peppers and steak.  I dined in this time and the restaurant was generous with their chips and salsa.  The serving was huge and I had to take some of the quesadilla home.  Authentic Mexican rice.  It was light and fluffy without being too salty.  It was divine."}
{"text":"Overall, our experience at El Poblano was excellent. Service was a little slow, but they were busy and the staff was very nice and in the end got us everything we needed.  

The chorizo chimichanga was excellent, along with the cheese sauce.  Really, all the food we ordered was excellent, including beef tongue tacos, fresh guacamole, and egg and chorizo taco.

We would definitely go back when we are back in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food.  I have had the chimichanga with squash several times there and it's excellent every time.   The food tastes fresh and great.
The staff is super friendly and willing to help and make suggestions.  
Made to order, but the wait isn't bad."}
{"text":"Finally made if over to El Poblano to see what it's all about. First, the food was very good. We tried a standard burrito with chicken and the enchilada dinner. Both were as good as it gets in Madison. One gripe is that many of the items on the menu are made with \"pic de Gallo\". This stuff is full of onions which I don't like so I had them take it out of my  burrito. It was just as good without it. The salsa that comes with the chips for dipping is what should be on the food, not that pico stuff that probably comes in five gallon pails. I doubt it is made here. I would like to tell the owners to get away from that diner look as well. It is too bright and and unfriendly looking. Put some Mexican blankets over some of the windows and make it more homey is what I would do. It feels like a truck stop now and could be so much better. I would say the food is somewhere between Tex Mex and Mexican and is worth a look. If you want a soft drink you get a bottle with no glass and have to ask for one. Another oddity is the water dispenser which is in plain view. They dump bottled water in it and add a bag of ice. It dispenses from the spigot in the bottom. It should probably be behind a curtain or something. It sort of reminds me of some the odd things you see in Mexico. I would go back, especially to try the tacos on Tuesday.. (no alcohol served here)"}
{"text":"I lived for a whole year in Madison, just a mere stone's throw from this restaurant, without ever going. 

I was a fool.

To be fair, it doesn't look like much from the outside. The store is located in front of Woodman's, with no real decoration or fanfare.

Inside though, some of the best dang vegetarian Mexican food I've head, and priced cheap as hell too!

Their tacos and burritos can be made with fried zucchini or fried mushroom, and they are so ridiculously tasty even meat eaters would be impressed. I usually get the huarache (pardon my spelling) which is a corn cake topped with veggies, cheese, avocado, and salsa. It's HUGE and all of 7 dollars. Also, if you are a meat eater, they have 1 dollar tacos on Tuesday's that my husband says are quite awesome as well.

If you are there, make sure to grab some of their freshly made Mexican Bakery, very unique and tasty breads you won't be able to find many other places in Madison."}
{"text":"Authentic-style Mexican with an order and sit-down diner feel, some light table service.  I visited with the intention of ordering a basic burrito - which I did - but I sat in the dining room for 12 minutes or so for a simple meal I could have received much quicker elsewhere.  Taste was okay.  Lots is meat but the burrito seemed a bit....wet.  Price was decent.  I'd go back but wouldn't call this my \"go to\" burrito & taco place outside of the gourmet chains.  Bonus info: their churro sticks are awesome, esp when fresh and warm.  I believe they have regular, strawberry and caramel or vanilla flavors for the churros."}
{"text":"Great place to get tacos and enchiladas (and it is the real deal with the actual spices and corn tortillas), and the workers there are polite.

There is also a place to fill up your cup with water in the event of too much spice (the word \"hot\" doesn't lie!)

Better than Taco Bell but with same service time, and also, desserts are great (they are made just like they are in Mexico!)"}
{"text":"Really great food!  We come from SF area and moved to the east side a few years ago and are so happy to have this wonderful family making great Mexican food. They helped use with a party once and the food was a hit with everyone!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is they are working on their table service but otherwise it is great!  Highly recommend them in a city we found to have hit or miss mexican food!"}
{"text":"This is authentic fresh Mexican food; excellent service; casual dinning and generous portions. Love the endless chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Referred here by actual Mexicans, show up to find mostly Latinos eating there, so a good sign.

They advertise the best fish tacos in Madison.  I havent tried them all, but they are in fact, very good.  All of the tacos I have tried have been good to great, and on Tuesdays and Thursdays some are $1.  I brought a dozen or so home one Tuesday, ate them all, and went back for more.

My wife likes their tamales.  I tried a chimichanga, it was good, not great.

All of the baked goods that I have tried look better than they taste.

I have yet to find a Mexican restaurant in Madison that does it all, but this one does a lot.  4/5."}
{"text":"I'm just going to come right out and say it----- Best authentic Mexican food in Madison. I've tried so many taco joints in this town and finally I have a winner! 

Real Mexican cheeses! Homemade torta buns! Fresh fried homemade tostadas, $2 steak tacos. Winner, Winner, chicken dinner!

My favorite part about coming here is the fact that when I finish my free chips and salsa, they ask me if I would like some more. They even give me a choice of traditional homemade red salsa or salsa Verde. Love it! 

Mexican coke or any other traditional Mexican treat, your choice! They are all available.

From the time I put in my order to having a plate in front of me, I think they average around 5 minutes. Super quick service!

They are connected to Pan & Pan Mexican bakery, and when your finished eating I would suggest grabbing a sweet roll or donut for dessert. Yum! 

The servers are awesome! Very catering and caring. \"Just ask and you shall receive\" must be their motto. Great! 

Excellently priced."}
{"text":"Excellant food.  The hot sauce is really hot.  The fresh chips are thin anc crispy, not overly salted.   Wonderful mole.  The best shrimp tacos that I have ever had.....only surpassed by the blackened fish tacos.   Of the 20 people that we shared the meal with, all were very happy.  Very fast service and affordable.  The dining rooms is sparse and still has the same tables/chairs that the Hardees/Popeyes and other previous owners have used.  Though not comfortable, the food makes up for the lack of decoration."}
{"text":"A Mexican restaurant that doubles as a bakery. I walked in and was completely clueless of where I was, there was no food menu or anything in sight just a cashier with freshly baked breads and pastries. Basically, we had to ask for a menu. 

Order consisted of 1 steak taco, steak burrito, and a horchata. 

Food 
Taco - I specifically requested no cilantro and no onions on my steak taco, in other words plain; the taco came out with cilantro. They corrected my order and brought a plain steak taco out. Steak tacos were alright, steak was a bit dry little to no fatty pieces, very little flavor. Burrito - Burrito, I requested no pico de gallo in my burrito and it came with pico, I didn't bother to have them correct my order because I was too hungry. Burrito was filled with beans, very little steak. Although I do have to give it to them, the burrito was a good size. Horchata - Horchata was good, just overloaded with ice. So if you order a Horchata tell them to be easy on the ice. 

Pricing 

Great price for the portions of the food, Horchata was a bit on the expensive side $4 for a large horchata filled with ice. 

Service 

We were checked up on regularly, server did offer us drinks, staff was very friendly. 

Decor 

- Nothing special on the decor, plenty of seating, reminded me of a Popeye's restaurant. 

Parking 

- Easy accessible parking, full parking lot. 

Overall
Food was mediocre, I think they can do way better with the quality of their food. The portions were great, but other then that nothing too special."}
{"text":"Great casual place for street tacos. Decor is dated but service was friendly. We will be back."}
{"text":"Howdy folks!  Let me introduce you to one of my favorite mexican restaurants in Madison.  Well...restaurant and bakery.  They're located in the parking lot of/with Woodman's.  Now coming in the front door is a little different because you don't know if you should order at the counter or go sit down and give your order to a waitperson.  I've done both, so be flexible.  Another thing you should know about this place is the customer service.  Seriously, if we could clone these people and put them in every restaurant there would be no more service issues.  I was sitting in my booth, I had already given my food order when the elderly lady working here came up and asked if I had been taken care of.  No pretense, no \"I thought someone else was taking care of them\" stuff.  Just good service.  I always order soft corn tortilla Al pastor tacos when I'm here because they are some of the best in Madison.  The tacos are made just right with a good quantity of meat with onion and cilantro to complement the meat.  They also serve a tortas that my daughter loves.  Also a nice touch here is the warm tortilla chips and 2 levels of heat salsa.  The hotter one had my nose thinking about running.  Free chips and salsa are normally free at more expensive mexican restaurants, in my experience.  No...the tacos are not in my top three in Mad-town...but they're somewhere from 4th to 7th.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The most amazing food in what looks like a bakery in an old Burger King.  The enchiladas were great, homemade chips to start with the freshest guacamole in town.  Try the flan if you have room at the end, it is worth much more than the $3 price tag.  We fed a family of 4 for under 50$."}
{"text":"Mighty fine blackened tilapia tacos.  Reasonable prices and pretty fast take out service.  I tried the verde tamales, too. Excellent. I'll be back."}
{"text":"4.5 stars..

The road unpaved, the area throwing shady vibes...perhaps not your first thought of finding a gastronomical delight!! But looks can be deceiving as they say, and in this case in a good way :)

Decor : Simple, casual sit down affair with no frills n fancy but just the right elements to feel in place even if you propped straight out of bed for some Mexican goodness!

Service: It's a half n half approach which works for a setup such as this. You pick you menu card, grab yourselves water, your preferred heat level salsa (mild or spicy)and sit down. The nice folks then come around with free nachos and take your order. I dig the idea of this division of labor and applaud them to making the \"free\" items available at the customers will. 

Food: It was Taco mania upon us so although their menu did have a good variety to tantalize our buds, we stuck to our mania-ness and ordered 4 varieties of tacos - Blackened Tilapia, Fried Tilapia, Marinated Pork and Steak. The Blackened tilapia was moist and surprisingly had that perfect \"burnt\" aftertaste to it without it feeling actually having been burnt to death :).  The fried tilapia was cooked well but lacked seasoning. Both had a good sized portion of fish so well done there! Our star was the Marinated Pork. Yummmm and Slurp and some other adjectives of drool!!! Seasoning and heat were spot on, giving the pork a juiciness that balanced right with the onions. Paired with a dynamic contrast of Sour Cream made things only better! The steak was my least favorite but truth be told, in this fine company, it still was a great protein pick. I was so happy that they cooked it just a tad before the \"bubble gum chewy\" texture hits. 

Each taco was served on a pair of soft corn tortillas which though became soggy by the time we got to eating them, still had a genuine and present corn flavor which worked very well with pretty much all the proteins and their accompaniments.

Value : Here's where the place scores that extra .5 stars. For $2.5 per taco, this is a phenomenal value proposition!! Pair that with food that was actually really good, it cements itself as an absolute must try out place.

P.S. They have an in house bakery. Haven't tried it myself but hey I'm sure it must be good judging by their food."}
{"text":"The food: This place is some of best Mexican food in Madison. I highly recommend $1 tuesdays for tacos, and their chimichanga. The bakery has some good items too. They also have good home made chips and salsa. Which are free for dine in.

The cost: The cost on most things is just about right. Some prices are a little high.

Scenery: The place has really evolved in the last few years. In 2013 it looked like a popeys, now it looks like a restaurant."}
{"text":"I miss the breakfast burritos we would get in San Diego. Nothing in the mid west has come close, until now."}
{"text":"They have the best fish tacos in the Midwest. Their queso is my Favorite. Sometimes service seems patchy. Good so good it's always worth the wait. Staff is always friendly. This is my happy place."}
{"text":"Highlights/lowlights

1) great/authentic food
2) friendly service
3) more of a lunch place than a dinner place

El Poblano is a great place for a quick lunch! The food is very authentic, Mexican food. Friendly service, great salsa, and a Mexican bakery make this place great! 

The atmosphere is very casual, definitely more of a lunch stop than a dinner place. Free chips and salsa are provided and the servers are quick to refill chips when you run out! You can get a \"Mexican Coke\" in a glass bottle - delicious. The service is nice. Although it took awhile for someone to come over to us initially with the menus, once the servers knew we were there they were very friendly. Menu items include enchiladas, tacos, chile relleno etc. The food is great, really reasonably priced and the portions are generous.

Definitely consider EL Poblano if you are looking for a quick, authentic Mexican lunch!"}
{"text":"Had Tacos, guacamole, and tostadas. Everything was so good and employees were super friendly! Didn't get any of the baked goods but they looked amazing. Highly recommend and will go back for sure."}
{"text":"PROS: Great fish tacos, great price point
CONS: Hole-in-the-wall vibes

Really glad we discovered this gem. We tried the various fish tacos available on a Friday and they were all great. The endless chips and serve-yourself salsa added a nice touch. Normally I'm not a big fan of corn tortillas, but I found that I didn't really mind the ones here because they were soft and less gritty than ones I've had before. Don't come here for the ambience. Come here for the food!"}
{"text":"Although $1 tacos for Taco Tuesday were what drew me in, I ended up trying their regular-priced tacos (the $1 tacos are crispy tacos) which were more of a street taco. I chose chorizo and al pastor as my proteins, and also ordered a side of beans and rice. The chorizo was a bit on the dry side (as opposed to very oily) and the al pastor was decent. The tortillas were fresh. I also tried their horchata which came in a gigantic glass. Would recommend. I ended up getting a dozen pork tamales to go as well...they heated up nicely the next day for lunch and had a pleasant spiciness to them. I will definitely frequent this place more to try everything!"}
{"text":"I relied on trusty previous yelp reviews. Normally, I would take a look at the outside of this place and look over this place. I got the blackened cod fish tacos and they were some of the best I've had in the state. Everything was perfectly seasoned and fresh. 

The service was very fast and friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Great food Tuesdays hard shell tacos only 1.00 can't beat that. They are great 
We have had other items and all has been fantastic. Great friendly service"}
{"text":"The food here was excellent. It is exactly as good as I expected which is great. The staff also speak perfect English so you can actually understand if you don't know much Spanish. They also serve complimentary chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Solid taco spot here! They have a variety of fish tacos, both blackened and deep fried, and the usual pork, beef, chicken, and even lamb. Vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike will enjoy the tasty, fried zucchini option, as well as weekend specials. El Poblano is also a bakery so they have a bunch of fresh Mexican baked goods, but I haven't tried any of that yet.

Hit up the salsa bar for your fix of piquant and they have mild to habanero spicy. Notice the signage for $1 crunchy tacos on Tuesdays and $1 pork tacos on Thursdays. Grab a few napkins because those can get a bit messy. 

The blackened tilapia, fried cod, lamb special, and fried zucchini tacos are my favorites here and what I keep coming back for. The blackened tilapia is Cajun spiced, really flavorful, delivers a bit of kick, and comes with a large filet. The cod is fried perfectly crispy, maintaining the fish's mositure, it is topped with crunchy cabbage and peppers, and comes with a \"spicy ranch\" sauce. The lamb taco is traditional with a nice portion moist lamb and comes with onion and cilantro. 

Parking here is easy and the staff are always friendly, so get here."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Madison as far as I'm concerned. And inexpensive too. Tuesday is $1 crispy taco day. Yeah, they're the tortilla chip-like shell, but it's tasty and a bargain. Their fish and shrimp tacos are also pretty decent. Have I mentioned the cheese tamales? Wow, are they tasty. It's family run and they offer quality food for the price. Give 'em a shot."}
{"text":"Was in Madison on Business a few years back and had a taste for authentic Mexican Cuisine.  saw them advertise in a magazine El Poblano, and of course my appetite was increased.  Had my usual Steak Tacos and with chips Guacamole & Salsa. Their 'Cadillac' Margarita was very good with homemade ingredients.  Recommend those that want a nice spot for Mexican Food to consider El Poblano. When in Madison  Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican place in town. Their homemade chips and salsa is amazing. Best menudo in town (careful its spiceyy~) all the veggie options are amazing. Gotta get them tacos."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here on New Year's Day and loved it. I ordered the chicken enchiladas with hot red sauce and my husband ordered a pork quesadilla. The staff was very attentive and kind & the food was some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"High hopes not fulfilled

The recent re-opening of Taqueria Guadalajara had me in a taco state of mind, so the wife and I made the trip to the east side of Madison to El Poblano.  We knew the owner from her days at Tex Tubbs and were looking forward to her take on Mexican cuisine.  

The restaurant is in the parking lot of Woodman's East and hasn't changed a lot from its days as a Hardee's / Popeye's Chicken, other than a mural painted on the wall.  Some of the tables had embroidered table cloths under plastic, which was a nice touch, but many of the tables needed to be wiped down.  And the bullet hole in the window of our booth was a touch I could probably do without.

Once we were seated, we received a basket of chips with red salsa.  The chips were so-so; they didn't appear to be made fresh.  The red salsa was quite delicious, but the salsa verde (which you need to ask for) was the real star and we enjoyed our chips and salsa as we perused the menu.

I ordered three tacos:
The fried tilapia was by far my favorite.  The interior was flaky and moist and the exterior was well seasoned.  I would have preferred a little crunch, but still a very solid offering.  The garnishes of spicy mayo, slaw and pickled red onion provided nice contrast of flavor and texture.  I would like to come back to try the blackened tilapia and the shrimp versions of their Taco Del Mar.

The el pastor taco was very dry, I needed to spoon on several spoonfuls of the salsa verde to overcome the dry, chewy texture.  The dish needed a sauce or a little pineapple to provide some moisture.  I'd take the el pastor as Los Gemelos over this dish any day.

The asada taco suffered from the same problem as the pork.  It was dry and chewy and needed several spoonfuls of the red salsa. It was my least favorite of the three tacos.

My wife ordered the chicken enchiladas.  The chicken was so dry that I could not cut off a section with my fork.  When she removed the chicken from the tortilla wrapper, the chicken stayed in cigar shaped tubes.  I was tempted to put one of the chicken tubes in my pocket as eat it like jerky, but decided that I didn't want to risk chipping a tooth.

At the end of the meal, my wife reminded me of her simple rule for evaluating restaurants: if the restaurant is almost empty at dinner time, there is a reason for that.  We really should have heeded that advice.  While I will return to try the other seafood tacos, she will not be accompanying me."}
{"text":"Thanks for the recommendation, Yelpers! Yes, it's a little confusing to discern if you are supposed to order at the counter or table. Seems nobody can see you if you don't go to the counter first. We should've grabbed a menu to the side of the counter and sat down. 

Salsa bar had two awesome salsas. We don't normally do mild, but their mild had big flavor. Chips were brought to our table and were fresh tasting (not sure if homemade) and nicely salty.

Had two tacos al pastor and a chorizo huarache. Get the chorizo huarache! Beautiful masa stuffed with black beans, then topped with flavorful, but not greasy chorizo. Topped with lettuce, tomato and avocado. 

Al pastor tacos were good. Not our favorite in town, but really tasty. 

Why are you still reading this? Go get that huarache and enjoy the salsas!"}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Madison! 

El Poblano is located in the parking lot of Woodman's east on Milwaukee St. 

Hands-down my favorite place to go for tacos, especially fish tacos. This is the only mexican restaurant where I don't request to sub flour tortillas for corn tortillas because they're AMAZING! And 2.99-3.99 depending on which t y p e of fish you like. 
Wow.

#lumenthehuman loves the fish tacos too, and the asada meat is tender enough for her to eat on her own and she's not even 1 1/2 yet! 

I've been to every hipster taco joint in Madison where the food is TWICE the price and no where near as good. 

My photos are of half eaten food because, priorities!

I was blown away that I didn't have to wait in line to order lunch on a Wednesday! 

Do yourself a favor and make a trip. You'll be glad you did!

{"text":"Not impressed.  I ordered chicken enchiladas.  There were pieces of chicken cartilage in them.  A friend of mine also had this same problem in hers. Sorry to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"Returned for more tacos about a year later. They're still delicious. You are missing out if you're not going here for every Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic no-frills Mexican food in a commercial strip, right next to the east side Woodman's.  We went in on a Sunday and the place was pretty empty, but the welcome from the family staffing the bakery/restaurant was warm and friendly.  There are menus and there's table service.  We had carnitas (a weekend special) and the blackened fish and shrimp tacos (they'll give you one of each if you ask).  Both were great  and the two salsas offered alongside were fresh, complex and tasty.  And you can't beat the price!  My favorite Mexican in Madison; we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Rare individuality; high quality; above-average ingredients; real care in preparation.

You don't hear a combination of aspects like that often about 'Mexican restaurants' - - but this order-at-the-counter get-served-at-the-table place is hands down better than the sit-down places with the plain salsa, the generic ingredients and the cloned cliche entrees:

Salsa:  there are two - - the mild is thick & tomatoey with nice herbs;  the hot is potent and complex.  These are GREAT salsas.  Absolutely delicious.

Chips:  lightly heated/toasted to really give nice texture and to bring out rich corn flavor.

Tamale:  tender, flaky, nice balance of cornmeal to pork & flavorings; very nice.

Tacos:   the corn tortillas are fragrant and delicious - - they are remarkably moist, tender, and enjoyable;  ample fillings and satisfying balance;  the veggie taco is fabulous - - toothy veggies and creamy avocado;  the shrimp taco was OK but for me the dabs of flavored mayonnaise obscure the natural flavors of the shrimp.

Service:  wonderfully kind and gracious staff;  Location:  ideal for shopping at Woodman's East;  Decor:  it looks like a scruffy bakery when you walk in, but the dining room is big and clean with some nice decorative touches.   Price:  the two large tacos plus a tamale with chips & salsa (see picture) was $7.20.

If you want to take off points, the view to the Woodman's parking lot is not exactly the most awe-inspiring;  and I do think mayo doesn't belong in a taco."}
{"text":"Amazing! I was super impressed by the salsas. The hot was too spicy for me, but the mild was perfect. The chips were good too and the servers were great about bringing more chips to the table.

I don't remember the name of what I got, but it was fried dough mixed with meat of choice (I chose beefsteak), with lettuce, sour cream, cheese, avocado, and pico de gallo on top. I guess it kind of looked like a decomposed burrito. It was delicious! I probably ate it wrong. I ate it like a monster would. 

I also got a blackened tilapia taco. It was also delicious. The fish was blackened, but not to the point where all I could taste was that char. I loved that it came with avocado. Avocados are great.

I'm looking forward to coming back here. The prices were super reasonable."}
