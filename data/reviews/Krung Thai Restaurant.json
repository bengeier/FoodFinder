{"text":"Ate here once but I might come back.  The food is palatable but I like Thai BBQ better."}
{"text":"We tried pa Thai with shrimp and ong Choy last night , it both tasty , but the price kind of high , and the veggie -- ony Choy , they only have cook the stem , no leaf ?which $8.99 an order , no match the price!"}
{"text":"Finally stopped in today after eying this place for years.

Damn it, another place serving cans of soda, seriously?  It's 2013, not 1983, where are the refills at?  How am I supposed to get my afternoon caffeine kick from one can of soda?

I had the chili mint shrimp lunch special.  Krung's spice level tops out at 5, I didn't know this and asked for a 10, ha h, I think the waiter thought I was slow.  I'm not denying that so after he corrected me I still ordered the 10 spice level ha ha.  Yeah, it was a littler spicier than I planned for but still really good. 

My issue is the serving size...we are in the United States of America, load the plate Krung!  Fatties need fuel!  A few tortilla strips, a scoop of rice, and a small scoop of 'main dish' just isn't cutting it...at least not for the price.

Okay, yeah, I'll come back, but I'm still going to go back to the office after eating here and pound a donut to get me through to dinner time.

On a more merry note, the place was dead at noon so the service was good."}
{"text":"Best Thai food place ever. Big portions. The staff were nice and great atmosphere. They have a band playing on certain nights. Order their pad Thai or curry, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love the yellow curry and the pineapple fried rice!!! Delivery is quick. The food and soup are still very hot! Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Some of the best Thai food I've had. Decor could be updated, but maybe it's just their authentic decor, idk. I came for the food anyways, and was not disappointed at all. Recommended for sure."}
{"text":"I was trying to hit up Byblos Cafe today, but apparently they are closed for remodeling, so I decided to try Krung Thai for lunch, as I've always heard about it.

Iryne B's review is spot on:

Mediocre
Overpriced
Small portions

I ordered mixed veggies with tofu and hot tea - $11.50?  WTF?  I wouldn't have minded so much if there was something to take away, but there the portion was so small, I'm still hungry.  That sucks.  

There are any number of better thai places than this."}
{"text":"This place is so welcoming and everyone who works here is so friendly! They make you feel like family! That makes all the difference. Not to mention they have amazing food! One of the better Thai food restaurants I've been to for sure."}
{"text":"Empty plate. Every time. This is the best Thai home cooking in Las Vegas, hands down. Other places may have fancier doodads hanging on the walls, but  they don't have the awesome flavor and friendly family atmosphere. Big smiles, big flavor, and there's never a wait for a table! The occasional live band or karaoke seals the deal."}
{"text":"I been tried a lot of Thai food but when I first move here, me and my bf try out this place and I think I'll stuck with their pad Thai and crap gragon . So good and I think I can eat Thai food everyday. Good service and good people. The manager was so nice to us. I like it."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and the service is awesome. The staff is super  friendly and helpful. I've ordered delivery as well as pick up and its fast and fresh. Curry is excellent, though obviously a  bit on the spicy side no matter how muld they make it. This is definitely my go to Thai place."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE thai place in Vegas!! The foos is amazing the people are amazing and the atmosphere is very family like. I love theses guys and would reccomend that everyone try them!a"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try instead of our usual Archis. The food was average but both me and the hubby are having stomach issues right now. First impression when walking in was, cheesy. The place smells pretty bad. I guess we should have taken that as a hint but we didn't want to be rude. There's a dance floor with streamers hanging from the ceiling, a moped sitting to the side of the dining room (not sure why there's a moped inside of the restaurant) and horrible decor. Will definitely not be going back. Hope the stomach cramps and nausea go away soon."}
{"text":"Vegetarian friendly.  The food was delicious.  We were all vegetarian and they were able to make dishes without egg or fish sauce. We got the red curry and green curry with tofu, pad Thai with tofu, and padseeew.  My favorite were the green curry and pad thai and spring rolls.  But all the dishes were tasty.  Service was fast.  I will definitely come here next time I'm visiting Vegas.  A good choice for dinner if you want some good food at casual venue off the strip"}
{"text":"I just ordered delivery from them to our hotel. They are very very nice people. And they deliver very quick. their food is good, too. I ordered a noodle, a fried rice, a broccoli and a coconut milk soup, we killed it!"}
{"text":"We were cruising for a place to eat when we found this place and lucked out. The wait staff were super nice and made me hope the food matched. She was helpful when asked about gluten free dishes, and made some suggestions. The chicken satay was cooked perfect and the peanut sauce was delicious. Our food came quickly and we loved it. So nice to find a good meal so close to home. The helpings were large and we brought some home. The prices were very fair and service was excellent. Please let it be the same the next time we try it."}
{"text":"I was a lotus of Siam fan until I came here. It was right around the corner from where my friend and I just got done getting massages so we decided to just give this place a try. 

We ordered the spicy deep fried catfish and the spicy basil with ground chicken. Omg, both were sooooo good! I've been on the hunt for something similar to the catfish from Sala Thai in the Bay Area. I never found anything like it but I will say that I loved the catfish from this place just as much. We also ordered their desserts, roti with coconut ice cream and fried banana with coconut ice cream. My friend and I both agree that this place is much tastier than Lotus of Siam. 

I had to remove one star because their decor is really out dated and a bit tacky. But their food is AHHHH-MAZING!"}
{"text":"Excellent Tom Kah Kai and Im picky. Great food at decent prices. Good service. I had the tom ka kai and pad sew ee. Expertly prepapred and affordable."}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch special Thai noodles but they don't use the noodles I ate in other places it's dry and thin . Beef is over cooked"}
{"text":"Great venue for party people, our 2015 UIC Viva Las Vegas Reunion!
 
Food, Wine, Music, Dance Floor, Disco Lights, DJ/Singer... It's really tough to beat, just a few minutes from The Strip, two blocks from Gold Coast Casino!

The owner/DJ/Singer Announcer & his staff are great! Here's proof on YouTube:

{"text":"Visited this Thai place after reading good reviews on yelp,and I'm really disappointed, I was leaving in Thailand for 6 years and I'm having thai food 2-3 times per week,so I would say I know something about thai food,so the green carry was not good,the pad thai was no more then OK,basically everything that I oder was less then medium,....so people when you reading reviews don't  always believe what you read."}
{"text":"Great location near the Palms Casino, the food is priced below average
And is one of the best Thai I ate around town.
Atmosphere is relaxed and great for business meeting or one to one quiet hangout.

{"text":"As a thai food lover wifey and I decided to check out this place. We ordered their tom yum goong and crispy pork belly.

The crispy pork was outstanding! Its really that good! First time we tried the tom yum it was really good and then we came it for another visit, it was totally not no where near the first time we had it. So I had to give it a 4 star but the crispy pork was still on point this time so we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The food was good but extremely overpriced.  $13 for fried rice and $9 for an appetizer with cheap ingredients is not worth it.  The serving sizes are small too. Another Thai restaurant in Vegas which charges quadruple and takes advantage of local peoples' love for Thai food."}
{"text":"What a greatly kept secret. The food is amazing, The staff is outstanding, and if you go on the weekend the owner sings and a few brave souls get up and dance."}
{"text":"The best thai food in vegas. Good portions. Service is great. Will always stop by whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Its ok food. Ambience leaves a lot to be desired. Service was average. Had live music that day. Singer was good."}
{"text":"This place is bomb!!! Great food! Really sweet people. Yellow curry is so delicious. Well worth stopping by. Not to expensive also. Great service is well!!"}
{"text":"I can recommend the yellow curry, pad Thai, and steamed dumplings. The best I've had - delicious. The service is great too. 

There seems to be a lot of Thai restaurants around town, but they all taste the same. This place has a unique taste to it which puts it at the top of my list."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving thai on a cold day and this place gave us exactly what we were looking for. We shared tom kha, pad see ew, hot tea and some sticky rice dessert. The food was great and similar to my little Thai place in San Diego that I love. What really set this place apart and gives me most reason for the 5th star was the service. When we wanted dessert and with mangoes being out of season, we thought the sweet mango sticky rice idea was off the table. Our awesome waitress made us the the suggestion to try sweet sticky rice with coconut ice cream instead. The ice cream with the warm rice was super tasty, I would almost prefer this over the mango dish. The waitress was a super star, she kept our water glasses full and kept us smiling during our meal. I will for sure return here next time I come to town!"}
{"text":"After lots of food not so great for us we needed something \"healthy\". The Nom tak beef salad and glass noodle salad were amazing. Side of sautéed veggies (cooked just right). Then... Mango sticky rice for dessert- super sweet and delicious!!! Just visiting LV but when we are back in town we are coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with the pad Thai. We ordered for delivery at least once a week. Delivery is fast and they are always so nice. So sad I moved on the other side of town! We also always order the wontons! Looks like we will be making the drive to satisfy this craving!!"}
{"text":"hidden on a corner . i thought it was closed but my dad told me hes been there before so i decided to try it. walking in was quite pleasant the smell was familiar but i couldnt put my finger on it . the decor is very out dated but i like it . waitress was super nice and helpfull on explaining the food. i had the luch special beef pad thai it came with a cup of egg fried rice it was delicious for only $6.99 their spicy seafood soup was also great almost tasted like the instant ramen version, wich i love. we also had combination fried rice , lots of flavor. i had thai iced tea to drink, not enough flavor for me but i loved the food."}
{"text":"Best damn Thai food in Vegas.

Located about 2miles off strip and I would call this place a hidden gem, you can't go wrong. The owner does karaoke at night? umm YES! His wife and daughter work there who are just angels. 

Food was priced below average but quality was above average. Service was classic Asian style and it was beyond a memorable experience.

I've gone there 5 times now and it's always been ACES!"}
{"text":"This is MY FAV THAI SPOT!! Been comin here since 2007, 4-5 times a week, and no matter what I order its ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! Plus, when ever I want them to add an ingredient or take one out they get it right every time! The service is just as great as the food. I call in and once I start my order they already know its me. LOL Ive tried many places and I cant stray away from their fried rice, beef salad, pad kee mao, pad see-eew, chicken satay, crab ragoons, or thai dumplings!! Delicious everything is just absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of The BEST Thai places I've eaten at. Not only was the food amazing, but Tika was an exceptional waiter. Came here to celebrate our 2nd year wedding anniversary and first thing I wanted as we pulled into Vegas was Thai food. It is rare to find a spot that makes good Papaya Salad and this place DID NOT let us down. This will be our Go-To spot every time we visit Vegas. Thanks again Krung Thai and Tika for an incredible experience!!! Can't wait to be back!!! 

Our order -
Papaya Salad 
Thai Boat Noodles
Beef Nam Tok
Yello Curry with Chicken
Mango Sticky Rice 

All 5 were DELICIOUS !!"}
{"text":"The servers are extremely nice here! First thing upon entering we were greeted with huge smiles and warm personalities. Our waitress helped me find the specials in the menu with recommendations and was so pleasant while taking our order.... Omg they play live music late night too! It's setting the perfect mood right now. 

I ordered the Krung Thai steak which came with a special spicy sauce. It's not too spicy, for those with sensitive tongues. A friend ordered the papaya salad which tasted like perfection! Very pleased with this restaurant :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite mom and pop restaurant. I give the food a 5 star . Great seasoning and it's good servings . The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because it just a bummer on the weekends . You want to go eat and kinda relax and your not able too due to they have a karaoke and it's kinda noisy but in all honesty that's not a issue I'm just giving someone a heads up . If that is not your scene"}
{"text":"This place has courteous, friendly server, food is pretty good specially the mint shrimp and beef red curry, just be careful of how spicy you want your food though, I choose 4 and it's pretty s-p-i-c-y."}
{"text":"Hmmm... This place seems to be hit or miss for most of my friends...in that I think its mostly a miss and they think its a hit!  I love thai, so I must admit they have some good stuff but I've had better for far less. This place is expensive and that takes away from a lot that they try to do. There is random karaoke here which is cool, and they play sports when they can on the tv's... but then again it's all about the food, right?

CLIFFNOTES: Its open late (big plus) so try if there's no Lotus of Siam in your plans."}
{"text":"This place is freakin' legit.

Chicken Pad Thai spiciness level 3 out of 5 makes my head tingle and tickle. I love that sensation! Probably one of the best Pad Thai's I've ever had. I was getting my pregame on at the hotel though, so I am not quite sure how it would taste sober, but I would imagine it being really good anyway.

We had a rental car so we stopped by the liquor store next door to pick up some Jameson. Krung Thai can look really run down at night, so I was a bit skeptical to go inside. If you are ever near this area do yourself a favor and order some food, you won't regret it!

The owner was singing Karaoke when we stopped by to order some food to go. Pretty cool I guess!"}
{"text":"The food here was so flavorful and delicious. My partner and I visited this place based on the Yelp reviews and location off the strip. It was Super Bowl Sunday and there was only one other customer (yay) so the service was excellent and the food came out quickly. We ordered the Egg Rolls, Pad See Ew, Cashew Chicken, and Yellow Chicken Curry. I almost died at the table trying to inhale all of the delicious food. They have levels 1-5 for spicy and my friend thought it a good idea to get his cashew chicken a 4, and I just couldn't enjoy it -- it was super spicy and we were warned. The curry was cooked perfectly -- the potatoes were perfect and the carrots seemed to have been added later to keep some crunch which was perfect. And the Pad See Ew was perfect. I''ll definitely come here again when I'm in Vegas and I would recommend it to anyone looking for delicious Thai food off the strip at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great place. I love the food there. Everything is very fresh and the food is very tasty and clean. 
The only reason I gave 4stars is because of the place it's self. The people are very nice there but the place need a refresh, the place is a dusty I guess specially because of the carpets. But again I never regret when I order takeout from theme. Food is amazing."}
{"text":"Really not sure why I have not reviewed this place, yet! By far my family's FAVORITE Thai place in town. We are always disappointed when we go elsewhere. The food here is fresh and full of flavor. The staff is always kind! I am surprised at the reviews that are less than a 5-star, this place is great!"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite spot to go eat. It's the most authentic Thai food I've had. The customer service and atmosphere is very friendly and calm. I myself and Thai so I know good Thai food when I taste it!"}
{"text":"I love Thai and know Thai food well and this place is ok. I love the nightly karaoke Which I have witnessed every time I'm  in town.  The service is great!! Ladies are always nice and attentive. The food is ehhh for thai but not outstanding.  I am always a little nervous when there is a chinese menu next to the thai menu at any restaurant, so this was not surprise but I do like their hot pot Tom Yum Kai which makes everything better.   This place is really best for its ambience and karaoke with all the vegas/sinatra songs vis a vis the customers and the DJ."}
{"text":"Loved the yellow curry with chicken. Can't give 5 stars only because the pad Thai was a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"Just received my chow and it literally looked like they took ramen noodles from the packets and stir fried them with soy sauce and veggies. Tasted straight up like a ramen sucked all the soup dry. The previous time I got the chow mein, the noodles were different. Took a bite of this one.....threw it."}
{"text":"Best Thai food ever! Am is the best waitress! She was very sweet and that crab ragoon is the best I've ever tasted! You won't regret going here!"}
{"text":"We ordered to our hotel room, and the Thom Ka is amazing. The 5 is very thai spicy, which made my boyfriend happy.. Quan, and our delivery driver were so nice. Very sweet people.
Definitely will order again when in town! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I was craving Thai food after watching a movie at The Orleans Hotel and Krung Thai Restaurant was the closest Thai restaurant. It was approximately 1.2 miles away and was easy to find being that it was my first time here.

I had the yellow curry with chicken and my boyfriend had the red curry with roasted duck. My yellow curry was good and had a generous amount of chicken and potatoes.  The red curry was a little disappointing because it came with thinly sliced duck instead of roasted duck. Both curries were good but we expected roasted duck since it was advertised on the menu as so.

The decor was outdated and wasn't welcoming. The restaurant had grill vents even though they don't serve all you can eat bbq. They made the restaurant look darker then it really was but the grill vents looked maintained, clean. The decor had a cottage country feel in a low lighted setting.

The staff was very friendly and attentive. Our waitress was outgoing and had a great attitude. She welcomed us, showed us to our table, and said bye before we left. The bus boy and manager was also nice. 

What was awkward was when we paid, she asked if we wanted to leave the tip on the table or charge it on the card. We did tip her but I thought it was almost rude for her to ask. It's not what I'm accustomed to when dining. I thought it was impolite.

Overall my first time experience was a good experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in this past weekend to enjoy some Thai food. Was really indecisive, but saw this place had good reviews. So I went in to get lunch. The service of this place was definitely great, but that is biased seeming that I was the only one there. I was seating right away, the waitress took my drink order and gave me a menu. Upon her return with my drink she asked if i was ready, and I replied no. When she came back she asked me if i needed help, i told her what I was debating between and she walked me thru each item. Ultimately I went super basic with the Pad Thai. The Pad Thai was good, I have had better, but i give it a B+. For the spiciness I went with 4/5 and it indeed had a good kick! I drank about 4 glasses of water during my meal. As soon as the glass got empty the waitress was right there to fill it up, and each time asked a question about my meal. First, How is it. Second, Is it too spicy. Third, would you order this again? Fourth, are you ready for your check. As for as dine in experience I would give them an A+, again this being very biased seeming that I was the only customer at the time. I will definitely go back and try other options on their menu when I visit."}
{"text":"I gave this place 5 starts before but the last couple of times when I was here food wasn't the best and was lacking a lot of flavor and plain, lunch time special is not worth the money the portion of the food are really small just better to pay 2$ more in a different Thai place for a decent sized portion and better quality. 
Not sure if I will be back again lesson learned."}
{"text":"I had my staple pineapple fried rice. Excellent. And a different taste than I have had before. It had a black pepper seasoning that was a great touch. It was not subtle but not overpowering either. 

My wife enjoyed her Pad Thai. A generous helping of shrimp."}
{"text":"They being so cheap not adding white rice on the side how it's supposed to be in other restaurants, I am not going to order from them and Mongolian beef is bad not a Mongolian recipe....."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 plates from here delivered 2 were pad thai at spicy level 2 out of 5. Well one was a lot darker looking than the other so when I tasted the darker one it was hotter than the other one. I called to let them know & they want to tell me that I got them both the same (as if I didn't know that) & that 2 is 50% spice level. Which I understand but this plate tasted like a 4 on spice level. But the guy that answered told me they had it written down as a 2 but yet he never even saw the plate because he never cooked it. If he didn't even see or taste it how can he be so sure its not more spicy than the other one we ordered? 
Instead of trying to keep us happy as clients & make it up to us next time or something they want to act like I'm lying. The Mongolian beef was the 3rd item we ordered & it was more like a mixed veggie with a couple peaces of small meat. 
Last time we order from this place"}
{"text":"Stay away!!

Stay Away!!

The waitress gave us two bottled water which you have to pay when we asked just water only for drinks. Thai food is usually spicy, you need to drink plenty of water to wash down the spicyness, right? I guess they found a way to gouge you. 

The biggest insult of this place was they asked to see my ID when I gave them my credit card. That is my first and only ID-check ever in a restaurant.

By the way, this happened to us about 2 years ago. We have not even been to that shopping center for anything because of the bad memory."}
{"text":"Krung Thai is great and quick. Their soups are amazing and so is the Pad Kee Moa! It's definitely a cute spot to hit up for some good Thai. Pictured is green curry, pad kee moa, Tom kha, and fried bananas..."}
{"text":"We stopped by while on Las vegas and we're delighted by the flavor and spiciness at Krung Thai.

We had drunken noodles with four stars and it was wonderful  even with added heat the flavor w as still there.

The pad thai was very good as well."}
{"text":"I am a frequent flyer of this place. The food is THAT good. My favorites are the Tom Yum Goon soup - feeds 2 people. Huge portions! My second favorite is the spicy catfish and it sets my soul on FIRE! All dishes are amazing: beef jerky, Larb salad, pad Thai, fried rice, all curries. I am working on the whole menu."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Vegas! 
It is the best place to come anytime for great food. I went to Krung a few times and everything on the menu was amazing!"}
{"text":"My experience was not like the stellar reviews of others. Great, friendly service but food was kind of lackluster- duck curry barely had any duck, tom kha soup was overwhelmingly spicy with few mushrooms and lots of dry chicken. It's my favorite Thai dish and I tossed the majority of the order. Takeout order was ready quickly and employees were very nice, but I'm apprehensive about trying other dishes here. May return for the crab fried rice."}
{"text":"This is a nice quaint place. The food is affordable, authentic thai food. On certain nights, the owner sings and performs and is incredibly talented. Will definitely make this a regular joint of mine."}
{"text":"THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A NEGATIVE TEN. ORDERED A BUNCH OF FOOD WITH coworkers and they brought us about half of the food. Ok, mistakes happen, so I called to let them know, in the hopes of them being apologetic and sending the missing food ASAP. Instead, I got the rude manager telling me I ordered it wrong and they did bring all the food. I reminded them that I have no reason to lie, that we order for them (in hefty amounts might I add) often. He said I cannot bring you anything else and nothing else to say. so yeah, we had half of our order and very disappointed. NEVER ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Very happy!  This was the first time I ever placed an order (and paid) though Yelp.
I Submitted my order with a special request. My order was all ready for me when I arrived. The woman who greeted me was super nice. She advised me how they attended to my special request. The food was packaged up securely and was very tasty! 
I would definitely order from them, or even dine in, again!"}
{"text":"Always has been my favorite place to eat, Thai or regardless. Staff is very friendly and so is the owner. Food is always top-notch, can't think of any mediocre meal ever in the 13 years I have been eating here."}
{"text":"I saw this place after hitting an office around the corner. I was the first customer after they opened up lol. I decided to try their lunch specials. 

Price: affordable
 
Ambience: nice

Service: good

Parking: cramped lot

If I didn't live on the other side of the world, I would visit this place more often lol."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The staff is always so kind and genuinely seem happy to have the business, which is always nice.

The food is also really good! I love the crab rangoons! 

Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"The curry and pad thai were excellent. I might up the spicy level for my next trip. I err on the conservative side on my first visit usually just to be safe. A 2 1/2 was good, but a 3-3 1/2 might work better for me. I am not a fan of restaurants that don't have a drink fountain. Seriously, I need my refills. That was a turn off, but the food more than made up for it. I look forward to trying my favorite dish, chu che, on my next visit."}
{"text":"I keep coming back because the food is consistently good. I really love their yellow curry with shrimp or chicken and extra pineapples. The curry has carrots, onion and potatoes, but the addition of pineapple makes it soooo much more delicious. What I like the most is that the food always tastes the same so there are no surprises. I have yet to have a meal here I didn't enjoy. 

Besides the curry, I also like the pad thai, Tom Ka soup, and cream cheese rangoons. I haven't tried much else because I can't stray away from the curry. The girls who work here are always friendly and accommodating. I usually call in my order and it's ready withing 10-15 minutes. I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I said i would never order from them again, but i am addicted to those dumplings!  This time, the spiciness was way off.  I ordered a 3 and a 5, neither were spicier than a 1.  My big issue was a dish that was put in a regular covered foam plate, but had so much juice that it leaked all over everything, clothes, shoes,  table as soon as i picked it up to take it out of the bag. It should have been in a soup container,  and hey, no rice for all that leaky goo?  Guess ill just get 4 orders of dumplings and get my food from somewhere else."}
{"text":"Pad Thai here is a YES.
Spicy levels here go from 1-5, 3's perfect. 
Decently priced, decently portioned and just the right balance of sweet & spicy. 

My waitress went as far as going through the entire menu with me after I told her it was my first time in. Very friendly, great service - both ladies.

Will be returning for sure. Everything on the menu & everything I saw come out looked good too."}
{"text":"Crappy service! The worker argued in front of other customers about the food . They were really cheap on their food. Employees didn't even have good customer service . There was only my table and one other table . And they service took forever . All the workers did was stand around ."}
{"text":"Updating this review from 5 to 3 stars. While the food is great. I've since called my order in. And wow was the lady just rude. Maybe she's thinking since She can't see my face, it's an excuse to be rude over the phone. Anyways called twice for to go orders both times the lady was shouting and asking me the same question over and over even tho I already answered it in questions past. I order the same thing in the same order with the same requests so I know I got all the info she needed to know in by at least the second time I repeat it. And she does speak English so.... I get there and thank god the food was made correctly but I walk to the cashier lady who is on her phone and she was the woman taking my order and every time I go in there she is on her cell phone looking down. I stand and was not greeted so I say hi, no response, then I say it louder and say what order I'm here for, no response. It took literally a whole game of me playing candy crush for a level before she looks up from her phone and realizes me there the first time. The second time, of course on her phone yet again because nobody else was there. I waved and did the same thing, this time I kept talking to her until she realized a person was in front of her. This lady is whack and just so rude. When she realizes I'm there she grunts and looks at me inconveniencing her good time on her cell phone. Just rude. I don't really want to deal with this attitude anymore and will probably return on the off chance I really crave their food but it's not worth the constant attention making process I must endure. Food is great but when your workers don't seem to care to work there it makes the whole vibe of the place blow. 

Old review:
Wow just really enjoyed this pad Thai. I'm picky and this was just heavenly. The texture of the noodles were chewy just the way I like it. The sauce was not too sweet or overly powerful. And the vegetables were not overcoooked plus they use Chinese broccoli instead of American broccoli which was a plus! I was told this was the best Thai in town and I was definitely not disappointed. Prices were reasonable and I left full after a mango sticky rice made with the perfect amount of coconut milk already mixed into the rice rather than just lazily poured on top. This was the best meal I've had in a while. I'm stuffed with such good food"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for an early dinner on a weekday. The restaurant is spacious and clean, and the staff is very friendly. We ordered different items for sharing, starting with steaming hot tom yum soup - very good with just the right combination of savory and sour, and with lots of chicken; it seems they don't skimp on the proteins here. The egg rolls were good, crunchy and somewhat unique in that the main stuffing was rice noodles instead of the usual julienned veggies. The green papaya salad was OK - pretty standard for this dish. The beef pad thai was tasty, hefty, and loaded with beef. As is common with with pad thai, there's really more food than it looks when it is served. The curries were not spectacular but quite decent. Servings were generous, and some of us ended up taking some food home."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food in Las Vegas, the food is fresh and the flavors are explosive. My favorite dishes are the Phad Thai, spicy egg plant with ground chicken, spicy catfish, pork larb, etc, etc.  I have tried all the other top Thai places in Vegas such as lotus but I prefer the food here"}
{"text":"Ordered dinner to-go via Yelp's Eat 24 app.  

Still good the next day after drinking.

Got the:
Pad Thai 
Crab Fried Rice
Silver noodles with Shrimp

Ask for extra chili sauce if you need to, but their spice level is strong.  Out of 5, a \"2\" is  already medium."}
{"text":"If you're looking for legit Thai food. This place definitely should be considered. The down side to this place is that they charge you for everything. Asking for water, they give me a bottle water and that that's the only water they have. 

This place is a to-go kind of place. Atmosphere looks pretty dated and the parking is pretty cramped. Otherwise good food."}
{"text":"I used to like this place and my favorite was the Thai Beef Jerkey and especially the sauce that came with it! 

My last encounter at Krung Thai wasa couple of years ago and there was a big piece of broken glass in my soup! WTF?!!?? When we confronted the manager and the crazy waitress they felt no remorse!

So goodbye or laa korn Krung Thai!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food!  Ordered Thai beef jerky, chili mint chicken and spicy catfish.  The 5 spicy on the chicken was a little spicier than I would normally order but very good flavor.  Had coconut ice cream for dessert which was very refreshing for this 114 degree weather. Our server was very sweet too!"}
{"text":"food is good,....service is whatevers....prices WAAY too high! their portions used to be much bigger! i've been going to krung thai for about 6 years now, and they have evolved but now they hussle you! they even make you pay for water which is ILLEGAL!! i didn't want to say anything because my girlfriend loves the food and i didn't want to make a big deal of it but....seriously, i don't like coming here anymore. It used to be fun with the karaoke and all..but it's just too expensive now, especially for the smaller portions and higher prices, and hussle type enviroment.  And just to let anyone know, when they ask you what you want to drink and if you decide water, make sure if you decide to tell them just a glass of water with ice that they don't charge you. And the owner is a bad singer!! YUCK! get over yourself you old pervert! i was there one night and after i sang a song on stage, he came down and started touching my shoulders and kept on frequenting my table even when my boyfriend was with me!!"}
{"text":"This place is always empty whenever I come in. They have super cheap lunch specials and reasonably priced entrees. If I am looking for a quick cheap eat, I would definitely come here. 
Thom Yum Goong is on point! Spicy and Sour!"}
{"text":"with our recent move to the tropicana and decatur area, we've been on the hunt for new places to eat with a good value. First walked into this spot on a really chilly day and it was completely empty. Sometimes that moment you walk into an empty restaurant can be the most awkward thing in the world, this time wasnt strange at all. Considering the circumstances, we had great service, short wait for food and constant water refills. Although I've never experienced such sticky pad thai noodles in my life, they were delicious.  On that note, the other dish we ordered also had these sticky, skinny, long noodles. Too bad our hunger struck slightly past the lunch special hours. Everything was delicious & our server was very courteous. Spicy level 3 of 5 was very spicy.  4 would have been too much."}
{"text":"This restaurant sucks! What? Was that too harsh? 

I am always on the lookout for new Thai places to try in Las Vegas. I was driving down Decatur and noticed their lunch special advertisement on the building. The next day, I made it a point to stop by and grab some lunch to go.
 
First warning sign- The parking lot was empty, and so was the restaurant! I walked in and noticed that there was no greeting stand or host/hostess up front. As a result, I was standing there like an idiot unsure of what to do to place an order. One of the ladies in the back yells across and says \"table for one\"?  I scream back \"No, I need to place an order to go\". She motions me over to have a seat and hands me a dirty menu. 

I decided on a dish that they couldn't possibly screw up--cashew chicken.  Ummm, Wrong! Rubbery chicken with no cashews was what I ended up with. The lunch portion came with a side of steamed rice and a mushy egg roll.  

When it was time to pay for my $7.00 lunch, I handed the server my credit card.  She proceeds to tell me that my bill wasn't enough to use a credit card. Um ok--sorry that is all that I have right now. She didn't like my answer, and said something in a different language to another lady in the restaurant. She tells me that this time they will let me use a credit card. \"Wow-thank you for letting me pay you\". 

My wife then reminds me after my awful experience that we hated this place 5 years ago. The food is garbage, and the service is worse."}
{"text":"Thai food was so good.  It's off the strip.  Ordered pineapple fried rice, beef and chicken satay and won ton soup.   All of it was so ono."}
{"text":"Ive seen this restaurant for many years but never had a chance to check this place out. Well today was the day I pulled a U turn and said its time for me to try it.

I am pleased I made the decision. Their service was excellent. Maybe it's because we were the only people in there that made it easy for them to pay attention too us but what made the real difference is there attitude. I felt the conversation we were having was very sincere.  They really wanted to get to know me. 

I only tried 3 dishes. Roast duck curry which was ok.  The best part of the dish was the curry sauce. I have a feeling if I had it with chicken or beef it would've been much better.  The garlic shrimp was also ok.  I was expecting larger shrimps than the ones used.  The best dish we had was the crispy pork with Ong Choy.  The blend of vegetable with the crispy pork was perfect and seasoned right. 

The price is a little bit higher than I expected. It's about $2-$3 more than other Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"\"If you think a strength can be turned into a weakness, I hate to tell you this, but that's another weakness.\"
- J. Handey

I came here with someone looking for Crab Fried Rice...and that seemed to be an okay reason to come here. I ordered Pad Kee Mao with chicken and another friend ordered Panang Curry. The dishes were all fine, nothing I'd like to come back for considering the Thai options we have in Vegas. My friend was really into the Crab Fried Rice and I can appreciate that they were using real crab meat, and this was probably the best of what we ordered, although I'm not a huge fan of Fried Rice and don't typically order it when I eat out...so perhaps others would appreciate this more.

The aesthetics are less than appealing, making it a better option for take out in my book."}
{"text":"My Favorite Thai restaurant in vegas. Really like the service and the food here. Never disappoints. Love pad thai over here."}
{"text":"Typical Thai - nothing special. 
I ordered the Duck curry and it was just ok. I really love duck and basically order it at every Thai place. I feel they went cheap on the duck by only giving me 4 slim pieces when I have been to other places and have gotten the same or more but more flavor and thickness for the same price. 
Spicy wise... Phenomenal. The flavor is amazing. I got a 4/5 and it was great. Some places really can't hit the I want a little more spicy but not too much where I can't taste my food anymore. 
I wouldn't go out of my way to try this place, but I wouldn't say I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Thai food. I could eat it every day and never grow tired of it. I was really excited to check this place out, although I pledge allegiance to Kung Fu Thai haha. The food was delicious but it just didn't measure up. I have yet to find somewhere that surpasses the flavor of Kung Fu Thai. The pad thai noodles were a bit on the soggy side - it felt more like spaghetti - and the chicken was a bit dry That was a disappointment because pad thai chicken is my go-to dish), but the rest of the dishes were amazing. The rice was cooked perfectly. My girlfriend loved it though and so I'm sure we will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here to get food. Their beef meat ball noodle soup is fantastic! You can order the level of spicy you want!"}
{"text":"I just finished my take-out from here and my experience has forced me to write a review. I ordered Gai Pad Prik Khing. It was some of the best I've ever eaten..perfectly cooked in that slightly dry (dry as in wine not as in desert sand) way that chili paste based dishes should be. I could smell the aroma of the Kaffir lime leaves steaming the whole way home and once I dug in it was even better than i'd hoped for. A perfect blend of chilis and curry paste that finished in sweetened fish sauce and kaffir lime. What forced me to write the review was not only the incredible food, it was also the great hospitality that I received when I walked into the restaurant. It deserves some sort of recognition and this is all I have to give. The man that greeted me at the door made me want to come back time and time again. He took an interest in my person, my visit and provided jovial banter while I was waiting for my food. Such a small amount of his time has left a lasting impression on me and I swear that every time I visit vegas this will forever more be a guaranteed stop."}
{"text":"This is my favorite thai restaurants!! Perfect pad thai and the wonton chips are amazing and the staff is wonderful!! Great lunch specials too!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a really good Bangkok style Thai restaurant after losing my favorite one in Vegas, and I think I have finally found it.  

This is your typical hole in the wall Thai restaurant with karaoke.  The place was just about empty when I arrived in the late afternoon on a Sunday.  This was no indication of how the food would be though.  I actually quite enjoyed it!  I ordered the Crab Fried Rice ($12.99), Chicken Panang ($9.99) and had a taste of the Pad See Ew ($8.00). 

The Chicken Panang was an excellent balance between flavor and sweetness.  I've discovered a trick with the sweeter curries like Panang - order them on the spicy side to offset the sweetness.  This Panang wasn't too sweet for me, but it could be if you are picky about that.  The one thing that I think could be improved is to add bell peppers or potatoes or something to the Panang.  It was only curry and chicken!  Thanks to Jade for recommending this one.

The Crab Fried Rice was wonderful, and thanks to Paolo for recommending it.  The rice is light and fluffy.  The crab is fresher than canned crab, and was very tasty.  With a little drop of fish sauce, I adored every bite.

The Pad See Ew is good, although not the flavor style that I prefer.  This one is a bit more \"saucy\".   I prefer it to be \"smoky\", but it was still very good.  The Chinese broccoli had the flavor of the noodles cooked into it, which is good (although I love the flavor of Chinese broccoli alone as well).  

Updates:

The chu che with shrimp was exceedingly good.  I can't recall the price, but it was a little bit high (but worth the money).  Unlike the chu che I have had elsewhere, this is more of a curry paste.  I can't describe the beauty this dish had when lightly mixed in with the crab fried rice.  The portion was a little bit small, but the shrimp were big and very juicy, way tastier than your average shrimp at seafood restaurants.    

The green curry with shrimp ($12.99) was an amazing green curry.  I knew it was going to be good when Matt told me this place was a favorite of his.  It came with bell peppers, and lots of bamboo.  The curry was in texture (Bangkok style), and had a wonderfully strong taste with a perfect spice level (ordered it with medium heat).  The flavor was very unique, with a just a pinch of sweetness to it.  This is probably the second best green curry I have had (with the first best being impossible to get any more).  

Pad gra pow gai (gai for chicken) is a ground up meat dish with a light chili paste, and peppers on top.  This went extremely well with my green curry, so much in fact that I couldn't wait to get to a computer and review it.  The chili paste was excellently prepared, and with the green curry, finally brought back that taste of Bangkok that I've been looking for.  

The downside of this place is mentioned in other reviews, and that is it tends to be a couple of dollars more expensive than your average Thai restaurant.  Well, guess what, you get what you pay for.  The more expensive items on the menu are the seafood items, but the shrimp and crab meat that they use is a higher quality than most Thai restaurants.  So, stop complaining about the price. ;-P"}
{"text":"Just ordered a bunch of dishes, all with level 3 and 4 spiciness and WOW they were all delicious!  Great balance of heat and sweet for the curries, and nice fresh crispy veggies in the rice dishes. Really fast and friendly, we picked it up like 20 minutes after calling at like a half hour before they closed. This place is literally right around the corner, and we will be back soon!  Try it!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food. This is a small mom an pop place with excellent service. The staff was very nice and attentive, my water glass was never empty. I had the chicken pad kee mow and I loved the crispy green bean in it. Everything tasted fresh and it wasn't super greasy. The spice level was warm I got  a number 4 on a 5 scale and it was plenty hot. I would not want to taste a 5."}
{"text":"We are always in the mood for good, juicy, moist thai noodles and this place delivered!

The older homey decor and ambiance meant nothing to us - the food and service was on point! 

I can't be happier with their pad thai dish, flavor country for sure! The pad thai noodles were crazy moist and packed with flavor, we enjoyed every bite. The noodles were cooked to perfection, not overcooked and with a little bite to them. They were just perfect! 10 stars for the pad thai (Yup it's over 5 stars)

We also ordered panang beef curry - this was the first place that didn't pack the curry with a bunch of cheap fillers. They hooked us up with a ton of tender beef - a mountain of tender beef to be exact. That's a great value and we didn't feel cheated. A minor flaw - I felt that the dish could of benefited from having more curry for the beef ratio that we got. Anyways, I can't really complain since there was a ton of beef!

The service was amazing as well! I'm extremely satisfied with their waitress and their management. The waitress hand cut our thai bird chilies in fish sauce for us because we requested them and they didn't have any available in their spice tray. We love the fact that the owner was there (late night 10:30pm on a Sunday) overseeing things and chopping it up and playing cards with his regulars. It really shows his dedication to his restaurant and it comes through in his food. Really good people. 

Their spice levels are from 1-5. Their spicy #3 was an exact spicy #3. True to flavor. We are spice junkies and could of done a #5 and enjoyed it, but we dabbled in the spice tray a lot and it worked out well for us. 

Portion wise, the pad thai was a great size for one person to get their fill on the juicy good stuff. It's not family sized and not necessarily big enough to share, but that just means more of the good stuff to yourself! 

Total damage $24 and change - a great solid dinner price."}
{"text":"The food was very very very good I haven't had coconut ice cream this good since the last time I was in Thailand also the Thai basil in the food was amazing"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place because my cousins bf suggested it and it was totally worth it!! The food was awesome & the service is amazing. Paul our waiter/entertainer was really nice! He also can sing very well :) I would definitely suggest this restaurant and will be back next time I visit Vegas. 
I got the pad Thai yellow curry and everything tasted awesome. Really glad we came here."}
{"text":"A hidden gem, this is by far my favorite thai restaurant.  And their menu is huge so I can't even begin!  I absolutely love their glass noodle soup...with small pieces of tofu, cabbage, green onion and little pork meat balls...Mmmmm mmmm mmmm!  Rad nah is great...so is their shrimp clay pot with glass noodles.  But my favorite????  Their pad thai is AMAZING!  Different than the pad thai I have had most places, they use thinner noodles with slivers of chewy tofu and your choice of meat!  And heat fiends beware! I love spicy food and their 3 (scale of 1-5) is pretty damn hot!  But the food is excellent and the servers are great.  When I come in, they great me by name and ask if I even need a menu.  LOL"}
{"text":"Originally me and the wifey were gonna go to Blueberry Hill since we have never been there. This place just happens to be right next to it. Since my wife loves Thai food and we have never been to Krung Thai, it was a no brainer.

Came in on Thursday night at 8:30. They close at 11 so we had plenty of time to order and eat. Was greeted and sat down right away. There were only a couple other tables occupied so im assuming the dinner rush has already come and gone.

We order our favorites. Deep Fried Tofu, Pineapple Fried Rice, and Shrimp Pad See Ew. The deep fried tofu was good as expected. Golden and crispy with a side of a sweet n sour type of sauce. The Pineapple Fried Rice was just ok. It didn't have the abundance of pineapple chunks like im used to. You would think that with the name of the dish that pineapple chunks would be all over the place. I think there was only about 6 pieces?

As for the Shrimp Pad See Ew. Ironically the ew part of it was real. As I moved the dish closer to my plate I can smell the distinct odor of raw shrimp. Like it wasnt cooked all the way enough. At first I thought I was imagining it but once I started eating it all I could taste was something close to like raw shrimp on the verge of spoiling. My wife had the same reaction. It was at this point that we requested another order of Pad See Ew but with beef instead. I had to get a new plate because the odor was lingering on it. After about 5 minutes we receive our new dish. As soon as I took one bite I can faintly taste the same thing just like the last dish. At this point I was thinking maybe they cooked the food in the same wok with out washing it? Why else would the raw shrimp taste still be there?

By this point me and the wifey just ended up finishing the Pineapple Fried Rice and Fried Tofu. We ended up boxing the Pad See Ew. Why I don't know. Maybe we will try it again later to see if it was just us? Umm....nope, still tasted nasty. I know what you guys are thinking. Send it back? Take it off the bill? No, we are not the type of people to keep complaining especially if we gave you a second chance already.

This does not take away from the service which was good. Our server was there for refills and redoing our second order, etc.

In closing, I don't think we will be coming back here any time soon. Maybe we just caught them on an off night. Hopefully the next visit if there is one, it will be better and I can update this review accordingly.

{"text":"No better Thai food! We have ordered basil leaf beef with sliced beef (steak) and spice level 4 out of 5. Chicken Pad Thai with spice level 3. Tom yum soup spice level 4. Panang curry spice level 3. Yellow curry chicken spice level 3. 

Since there are so many Thai restaurants here in Las Vegas, and Thai food is my favorite, I experienced other Thai restaurants and Krung Thai (not to be confused with Krung Thai Siam) is hands down the best. If I had to put them in order based on which ones I have tried it would be: 
1) Krung Thai
2) Khun Chai Thai
3) Archie's
4) Thai BBQ
(Krung Thai Siam would not go on the list!)"}
{"text":"If I could do less than one star I would.  The portions are small and the food had very little flavor and the veggies in the Mongolian chicken were raw."}
{"text":"This place is slowly becoming one of my favorite lunch spots! I had never heard of this restaurant until I started working down the block a few weeks ago. Decided to stop in around noon, and was impressed. Tasty food, quick service and attentive staff. Can you ask for much more? 

I recommend the squid salad. It's not on the lunch menu, but worth the extra money!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has no atmosphere and the tables are too crowded together.  The food is mediocre and for the size of the portions, overpriced.  The sliced beef in my meal tasted like it was simply boiled in water & then dropped in the dish.  I was also pissed that a gratuity of 18% was automatically added to the bill for a party of 2, without any notice to that effect mentioned on the menu.  And then the credit card statement had the audacity to ask for a tip.  There are so many other Thai restaurants in close proximity in this neighborhood.  I will never return nor recommend Krung Thai to anyone."}
{"text":"First time visit this Thai restaurant. Cozy atmosphere minus the bamboo shoot smell. It might smell strange for those don't know what's bamboo shoot. :) we Ordered fried rice and green curry. The food was so good despite the fact it's a little pricier than other Thai restaurant in my opinion but overall the food was worth it. The waitress was so nice. Definitely added on my Thai restaurant list to go."}
{"text":"After passing this place so many times and seeing the lunch special sign, I was finally able to try it. 

We walked in around 2pm and there was only one other party. They seemed to be regulars since they were talking to the waitress a lot. We were seated at a nice booth and given our water right away. 

We got our lunch menus which included seven dishes for $7.99, all with shrimp and fourteen dishes for $5.99, chicken or beef. All of the lunch specials come with an egg roll and steamed rice or fried rice. You can also choose between their soup of the day or small salad. 

We opted for the chicken pad thai (level 4) and mongolian beef (leve 3) plates with soups, Thai Iced Tea, and Thai Iced coffee. 

The soup came out right away. It was definitely nothing special. Just some broth with a piece of bow tie pasta in it. 

Our lunch specials came out and boy did they look good! They were decently portioned considering they were only 6 bucks each. They each had a big scoop of rice, egg roll, and about half the plate full of the entree. 

The taste of the mongolian beef was pleasant. Level 3 was a perfect choice. The meat was soft and the spices were just right. The pad thai was pretty delicious as well. The noodles weren't hard at all and it had some pretty big chunks of chicken. 

The Thai Iced coffee and Thai iced tea was okay. I've had better.

We ended up ordering the Thai tea ice cream for dessert, which was a mistake... The ice cream was rock hard with ice crystals all over it. It tasted like it was sitting in the freezer for at least 6 months. 

All in all, I'd definitely come back for some more lunch specials. However, I won't be taking any chances by ordering the dessert again. 4 stars for food and service, minus 1 for old ice cream and mediocre drinks."}
{"text":"i'd like to say that i am a seasoned thai food eater, and i think this place is very mediocre and expensive for what it is. i ordered beef pad thai and chicken panang curry, very simple, basic dishes to test. the portions were small, and as far as taste....i was not at all impressed. pad thai noodles were dry, and the curry had nothing but dry chicken pieces and the curry broth...no vegetables

i ordered over the phone for delivery, and after tip came out to be just under $30 for the 2 dishes. the only thing to their credit is that the lady on the phone and delivery driver were very nice.

oh and they did not have masaman curry, which i was disappointed with as well."}
{"text":"I passed by this place for about a year always wanting to try their food but never had the opportunity. Finally one day I was craving Thai food and thought specifically of this place. Kill two birds with one stone, right? =)

The inside decor is comfy and welcoming. There's also a big stage near the dining room so I guess there is live music + entertainment as well. They have the regulars such as pad thai, fried rice, satay, etc. I had the pad thai and the beef salad.

The food is great! I really enjoyed the pad thai. I felt that the food was really original. At Archie's the dishes taste very stylized and catered to be more Americanized, which is not bad at all because I enjoy Archie's alot. At Krung Thai there is no burst of flavor or a WOW factor like Archie's but it is a nice balance, if that makes any sense =P. You can see what I mean if you try the beef salad. It doesn't have that tangy taste like at Archie's, which I highly enjoy. Still, Krung Thai's beef salad taste good in a different way.

The service is great and I don't see why anyone wouldn't try this place, especially if you're a Thai food lover."}
{"text":"Hands down, best curry ever! Also the pad see ew is delish! Ordered both with spicy 4. Fabulous! Great prices (curry was a lunch special $6.99)! I'm a veggie so did tofu and it was great. Wonderful service. Would loooove to come back soon but I live in Oregon. Great place!"}
{"text":"So easy to order for delivery !! They came 30 minutes earlier than expected ! Food is so yummy and the delivery guy was super nice !!"}
{"text":"I truly enjoy their fried rice but their chow mein is ramen from a package and poor customer service"}
{"text":"This is upscale Thai, and while you'll pay for that scale, you'll likely be happy you did. I was. Went there twice just to see if it was as-good the second time, and it was.

Appetizers are expensive, but they're meant for sharing, so the prices seem inflated until you understand the portion size.

I had pad woonsen, an off-menu item, and they made it both perfectly and very tasty. The kitchen is of reasonable speed, and large groups seem to be served well and hot, all at once. Staff is friendly, I'll go here again."}
{"text":"I use to live close so I tried them several times. Each time was very unimpressed with the taste and freshness. I have had much better Thai from places just a short drive away. Prices are decent and some things are okay but 2 stars is all I can give."}

We have eaten here multiple times: thought I had reviewed it!
Last night we got chicken satays which are very tender, the yellow curry and pad thai. You can get spicy levels as you prefer- but the high levels are very hot! We had delivery which we do every so often.
Compared to the other bazillion Thai restaurants in a two mile radius of our house (near Spring Mountain/Chinatown), this is the best!"}
{"text":"Really good Thai food. 
A little disappointed that I added eggplant to my drunken noodle dish  -only got about three pieces..  and the spicy basil rice didn't have a lot of flavor ( it was good but it just didn't have the basil spicy flavor and I ordered it the number 3- but wasn't spicy at all ) and it's one of my favorite rice dishes  when it's done right..
Also I had chicken and shrimp combo for the basil rice , and it ended up costing me $17 bucks -so just be Aware of how pricey the shrimp is...
I do still think it's really good Thai food and I highly recommend it compared to some of the other places we have to choose from in vegas."}
{"text":"Great service. Subpar food. Decor is absolutely haunting. Even if the food was good, I think my mood would have been completely ruined by the interior decorations. I was sincerely uncomfortable. Visually, it was terrible, and it does greatly affect how I feel about what I am eating. Don't expect anything less than Vegas prices!"}

I've never had thai iced tea before, but I think I tasted a bit of heaven.  The spicy noodles were delicious as well.  The fried banana would have been better if it came with vanilla ice cream but they only had coconut ice cream.  All in all, my experience here was very good, and the service was great!  Will definitely come back here next time I'm in Vegas!"}

{"text":"We ate here during lunch and their lunch menu was reasonably priced. Service was great and the food came out fast. I ordered the Panang curry off the regular menu and it was absolutely delicious - the rice portion could've been a tad bigger to finish the remaining curry. Their spiciness level is from 1-5, FYI. My gf ordered the Pad Thai off the lunch menu and that too was full of flavor. This place is definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"My dad insisted on going to this place after seeing it advertise in the Thai newspaper for months. so we went and the guy from the newspaper came out and served us it was the owner. Watching him work and how he cared about his place was very refreshing. the food is as good or if not better than the ones in Thai town. bring your friends for karaoke and party atmosphere at night.."}
{"text":"Quaint little spot for spicy hot thai. Usually my husband and I go to other places that do number level of spice 1-10 so we ordered our usual number 3 on Tum Yum soup and beef salad,  and boy it made my husband have tears lol! I had to send my soup back because it was like fire! We didn't know they do levels of 1-5 and 5 being the hottest!  So go figure..other than that,  the food was great. Staff spoke good English,  and I saw that they have karaoke on some nights. We hesitated to come into this place for months, and we're mad that we didn't do it sooner."}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved both the yellow curry and the Panang curry. Just the right level of spicy and creamy, and they were very generous with the sauce (a complaint I have with many  other Thai restaurants).  Skip the Pad see-ew. It was bland, and a disappointment next to the incredible curries."}
{"text":"Have been driving by this place for 4 yrs now and finally decided to stop in and try it out. 
I walked in and it was dead durning dinner time and all the waiters were hanging out in the corner watching tv and playing with their phones. 
On very nice girl helped us out and recommended some things on the menu. I ordered the red curry beef spicy level #6 out of 1-5. 
The curry was really good and had a great kick to it. And the wrapped up or food to go so perfectly I don't think anything could have spilled out. 
It was a great experience I want to try it out for its cheap lunch specials some time."}
{"text":"Had the pad Thai chicken lunch special very good actually one of the better versions I've had around town.  Can't say it was the best but somewhere in the top 5. Will be coming back to this place sometime."}
{"text":"The food was delicious!! They had really good service. Comparing to the other restaurants I've been to lately, this had the best service. There was really nice entertainment. A man would start singing and some kids came up to dance, which was amazing to see. I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant. Extremely recommended."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Krung Thai. I love Thai food so I'm always down to try new restaurants. It wasn't packed or anything so seating was very quick. 

We ordered the sweet and sour chicken, sweet mint ground chicken, and panang curry shrimp. Each order came with a side order of white rice. I also had Thai tea. The food was very good and the Thai tea was a perfect combination of cream and tea. 

The only thing is the sweet and sour chicken was a little tough to chew but the flavors was there. It was a pretty good Thai restaurant. It was pretty cheap too so it was wallet friendly."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food and sweet staff! Food tasted flavorful and fresh. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out for lunch so I can't comment on the dine in service, but I must be the only person that doesn't like this place! Maybe I'm ordering the wrong things...maybe I'm way too picky...maybe it's because I'm half Thai and I cook a lot of Thai dishes at home, but even my 6 year old turned down the fried rice from this place. I have to agree with her...and I've seen this kid her own boogers. The house fried rice was uber mushy and under flavored. I like my Thai fried rice with fish sauce and I didn't get much of that in this one. The lunch salads were wilted and brown on the bottom and looked less than fresh. We also ordred the pad ka prow and the pad thai (both with tofu) the pad kaprow was also pretty bland and the pad thai was mushy like the rice. Bum dealio. I'll stick to homemade."}
{"text":"My partner and I try a different Thai restaurant once a week here in las Vegas and truly found that this place is our favorite. All the others have been phenomenal in their own way but our favorite dishes are here. The Beef Jerky and the Tom Yum are at the top of our list!!!  Thank you Krung team for making every experience a great experience."}
{"text":"We just had diner and the food was just delicious we had Pha Thai noodles and they were just perfect the owner Paul was there all the employees were nice and very helpful. We also had spicy chicken eggplant which was cooked to perfection I will definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Panang Curry.  That's all I need!  However, the menu is fabulous.  We eat here every time were are in Las Vegas.  Staff is always accommodating and recommends a new dish for us each time.  Prices are great.  Service is great.  Location is a short drive from the strip but easy to find.  This place is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"The first time we ordered delivery for this place, my boyfriend was so surprised at how friendly and excited the delivery guy was! The food was good too, the sweet roti was really good. Super expensive, like 4 dollars for one, but I craved it so bad that I ordered it anyway. After that first time, we ordered again and the guy thanked us for ordering again but forgot one of the thai teas...which cost 3 bucks and some change. Now, I'm not gonna call them and complain about one thai tea, cuz what can I do? Have them come all the way back? We ordered again after that cuz in the end, the service was nice....the last time, someone else came, and he wasn't as friendly as the other guy so it was kind of a \"here you go, thank you, bye\" kind of thing. Averages out to a solid 3!"}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends on a weeknight since I knew it was so close to their house. 

We were the only ones when we walked in. The decor is a little old-fashioned, sort of the style of my Grammie's house. It was also quite warm which can be a problem in June in Las Vegas. It seemed that maybe their air conditioner was on the fritz but they had several oscillating fans stationed throughout the place. 

However, the service was fabulous. The lady that helped us was attentive but not to needy/pushy which can sometimes happen in an extremely slow place. The food was standard. Nothing fabulous but not bad either. I had ordered pad Thai. Their spicy level range is also really true to its scale. Often, I will ask for 6 or 7 and I require more chili to kick it up. This place gave me a true 6!"}
{"text":"Probably the second best Pad see eww in the city. Very consistent with food quality. Also they are open late so that is a plus. Good appetizers as well."}
{"text":"I had the chicken pad thai and ice coffee, enjoyed everything. 
The manager will sing at your request, or invite you to sing during 
their nightly karaoke around 8PM nightly.  
Looking forward to singing a Frank Sinatra medley on my next visit."}
{"text":"For a $5.99 meal I can't be too critical..or can I?

The service was great and you get a good amount of yummy food for your money. I chose chicken pad thai (spices on point), and it also came with soup, wontons, and fried rice.

On the bad, it was one of the greasier pad thais I have had. Then, towards the end of my meal, I had some friends join for lunch....3 ants scurrying across my table! Oh hell no. 

Hard to say I'll never be back. It's a decent 5.99 lunch special."}
{"text":"Delicious Authentic Thai!
Straight up Bomb.Com!!!
Just ordered pad Thai, egg rolls
 & crab Rangoon YUM YUM GIMME SUM!
Great menu & SUPER friendly staff/delivery 
If you like Thai give them a try / you will NOT be disappointed - they close at 10pm so hurry!"}
{"text":"The Penang Curry was SO good. I ate it ALL! Service was good. My only complaint about this spot is the reeeeeally ugly decor! Remember those mauve floral throw blankets. Imagine that on every booth. The vinyl table cloths with giant roses on them clashed big time. Other than that, the food was yummy."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants in town. Friendly service cozy atmosphere and delicious food. Get your karaoke on most nights, you can find the owner Paul belting out the standards or you can try and test your skills. Everything i have tried over the years have always been excellent. My fav's are; beef salad, papaya salad, Crispy fried tofu, Beef jerky?, Panang chicken curry, Pad Thai, Tom yum soup, Catfish surprise, Mint Beef, Garlic Chicken, well you get the idea. They are also open late to 2am I believe to satisfy that late night Thai craving."}
{"text":"Ohmygosh, yummy, yummy, yummy!  We had the cashew chicken, wonton soup, and a glass noodle dish the name of which I don't remember.  All were amazing!   Not only that: the people were really nice and the service was fast and friendly.  We'll definitely go back.  :)"}
{"text":"I honestly didn't enjoy my last meal here. I ordered through the yelp 24 app. And I was completely unhappy with my food. I ordered the chicken chow funn, and for some reason it had this overpowering fish taste to it. Like fish oil was used. I don't have a problem with fish. But when you are eating chicken and smelling and tasting fish it's super disgusting. I almost threw up and threw the rest of it away. I ate the potstickers and was left super hungry and 20 dollars short"}
{"text":"I love krung Thai the food is great and it has a great atmosphere I usually come in late night with a larger group and kt is always willing to accommodate!!"}
{"text":"This comes across as a pretty standard Thai food place but with one exception - Crab Fried Rice.

Wow. Have I just never tried Crab Fried Rice before? I was blown away. At Krung Thai, they give you a good heaping of crab meat on top of and mixed in with the fried rice. I could eat that all day. Yum Yum Yum. OK it's admittedly a little salty, but still.

Everything else we had was pretty good.

* Chicken Satay - pretty standard
* Fried Squid - very hot and surprisingly delicious on the inside
* Pad Thai - I actually haven't had Pad Thai in a long time, but this was pretty good
* Chicken Penang - Not my favorite, but good
* Krung Thai Noodles - A little salty and nothing amazing
* Crab Fried Rice - O M G

BTW, I only found out about this place because my cousins were singing Christmas songs there one night. When they told me Krung Thai, I thought they meant Krung Siam. I haven't tried KS, but I'm so glad I discovered Crab Fried Rice at KT.

3 stars with a CFR kicker = 4 stars"}
{"text":"The food was very good, however the service was terrible. Our waitress would not check on us enough and screwd up our order! So disappointed!  The worst part is that the food was soooo spicy!  We ordered a 2 and we immediately had running noses! We ordered a tom yun kai and it was very good, however the pang thai curry was not extraordinary. The decor is pretty poor, you can tell they decorated 15 years ago and never cared to remodeled or improve it!  Overall good food, but dont have high expectations!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from this place since I've been craving for some Pad Thai and the delivery was actually pretty fast. I ordered Pad Thai with beef and Chinese sausage fried rice. The money was definitely worth it and I will be ordering again sometime in the future! :) 

Update review 10/2/15

Ordered from Krung Thai again trying out many different dishes and I am please with how delicious the food was but one thing I have to comment is the beef was very tough and it was hard to eat."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge * 21/100

Per a good friend's suggestion (shoutout to Irena!) to check this place out, I decided to swing by on Saturday with a galpal for a late lunch. It was around mid-day, the neighborhood was quiet and so was the restaurant. We were the only people there with a few stopper-bys who ordered take-out.

Krung Thai is a quaint, cozy and affordable restaurant located along Decatur and Flamingo, not too far from Goldcoast, with a distinct homey feel to it. My galpal and I got to chit-chat comfortably and our initial server gave us ample time to look over the menu while getting us drinks to start things off. 

Eventually, we opted for the 5 piece chicken satay  for appetizer that came with a tasty peanut-butter-ish sauce and an onion-cucumber salad. I went with the yellow curry beef with rice and absolutely loved it. Almost similar to Japanese curry, the thai yellow curry is sweet with a hint of coconut milk, potatoes and carrot pieces. Topped it off with rice and I was stuffed! My galpal got herself the chicken larb. We munched on it with the cabbage strips to our tummies' content. What didn't seem like a whole lot of food ended up filling us only halfway through, so our second server, Amm, kindly boxed it all up for us. 

I very much appreciated the service. Whenever the waiter brought us our food, he always asked how things were for us and Amm was pleasant enough to tell us a little about the live entertainment they have as well as karaoke. Can't wait to take my parents here soon!"}
{"text":"The best Thai restaurant I've been to in Vegas. Food is amazing, great, friendly service. I've been eating here for years, and I have never had a bad meal. A must visit while in town."}
{"text":"Love the Chili mint with chicken and Mango with sticky rice!! Also best Thai food by the Palms for me! Had tried another place near by because this place was closed! And I was so disappointed. Before I leave today, I had to order one last time!!"}
{"text":"Food quality is good. Pricier than some thai restaurants, but I suppose it's because of the larger portions. Easy parking. 
-Thai Iced Tea
-Pad See Ew
-Tom Yum Kai with chicken
-Papaya Salad
Our Thai friends ordered lots of seafood, so perhaps we should've done the same. 
I liked it, but I would try some other places before coming back."}
{"text":"After being in Vegas for almost a week, I was ready to get out of the tourist traps and try some local food.  Discovered Krung Thai as I was driving by, checked it out on Yelp and decided to give it a try. 

Ordered Red Curry Chicken... The ingredients seems fresh and tasted great! I love HOT Thai food.. Ordered 4 but easily could have handled 5..

Great \"off the beaten path\" Thai place in Vegas."}
{"text":"My supervisor brought us to this place. Nice quaint and small mom and pop type of place. The food was great, I love spicy and trust me that you need to watch with the levels of spicy, it can get very spicy. It's delicious though, so good that your mouth is burning and you can't stop eating it. Customer service was good, very attentive and always filling our waters."}
{"text":"Seriously...i love spicy food especially thai food but... 

The break down:
FOOD QUALITY:   pretty good 4 out of 5
PRICE:  Too expensive for the portions, they even force you to buy bottled water! The bottles are SOO tiny, and can you imagine not having enough water when you eat spicy foods??
SERVICE:  OMG...the owner sings on certain nights and makes himself a rockstar?? One of the waitresses were kind of rude to us because one of my friends asked if the portions have changed...lol.  They also try to \"up sell\" everything on their menu, always coming around to ask us to try this and that....We felt like we were being hustled and all we wanted was to eat dinner..."}
{"text":"very good quiet authentic Thai food off the strip. Very friendly staff. Seemed like they know a lot of their repeat customers. The spices were good. I highly recommend this place as a change of pace from the usual Strip food. Not the safest of neighborhoods. Just be wary of your environment and lock your door. Good parking near the restaurant. That is safe. Just be wary if you want to stroll around the block. that's all."}
{"text":"I work nearby and have had their Chicken Panang Curry, Spicy Egg plant and beef jerky all were very good the prices are reasonable and when ordering through yelp using Eat24 delivery option (another great service)  Placing my order online with comments and specifics is a snap then I keep working until the yummy food arrives!  
:-)"}
{"text":"Not worth the price at all
Over priced bad quality of food
Ordered fried rice and sweet and sour pork for delivery which totaled 30$ before tip
The food was nothing more than ok as far as the taste, but wreaked havoc on both mine and my gf stomachs so I'm assuming it wasn't fresh
If I could give no stars I would
Never going to order from there again, nor will I recommend it to anyone else"}
{"text":"Not a fan of the karaoke on the weekends, but the food at this place rocks. 

Yum."}
{"text":"Nothing beats late night cheap food in Vegas. They deliver until 6AM (right to your hotel too)!! And they open again at 11 AM! Food quality / taste is one thing, but they definitely deserve a 4-star for opening and delivering late. Save their # in your cell phone as you would for a promoter's # when you go to Vegas. It'll come in handy on one of the nights, trust me."}
{"text":"Excellent food...We had the Thai dumplings which is similar to the Chinese siu mai, however the ingredients were different so the flavor was great. The larb salad was good. We loved the sea bass on a bed of  broccoli. The sea bass was perfectly crispy on the outside and tender and melts in your mouth with each bite. It was in a sauce which had a slight curry and sweet taste with a fine kick!. Service was superb with great explanation of each food and generous with their charge for the fish. The pieces of fish were smaller so they charged accordingly.Very fair!"}
{"text":"Live nearby and order from this place about once per month. The yellow curry & pad se eew always comes tasting great-- one of my favorites in town. Delivery is quick, and the driver never has a problem finding my place. Great restaurant for take out."}
{"text":"I appreciate that this is open late for swing shift people like us to be able to grab eats. I haven't gotten bad service or food here, but some of the previous reviews are a put off. I havent ever bought my water but then again I usually ask for a Thai Ice Tea first and they give me a complimentary glass....I guess they don't want to give anything \"free\" to drink. Been here quite a few times over the past two years, last visit was a few months ago. 

I particularly like their beef jerky here, its always nicely marinated and flavored. Massaman here was good though my BF likes their panang style curry better. I like their Pad See Ew here. Have had a few dishes, but their menu is fairly big so havent made much of a dent. 

Portions are okay sized though its priced a bit higher than most Thai places. Not ridiculously so, but still noticeable. Service even though we are one of maybe 2-3 late night people or even sometimes the only late night diners can be hit and miss. There are times they check on us often and such then there are times they are somewhere... 

It is a decent spot for late night hungries like us and I can't knock em for making beef jerky the way it should be. I appreciate too that it's quiet here as most late night Thai tend to want to be a kareoke/bar/restaurant at night."}
{"text":"Hands down best Thai massage ever! These gals have strong hands and great technique. Perfect combo of stretching, deep tissue and and they walk on your back! Will definitely be back...now for some Thai food down the street."}
{"text":"The food's ok but the lunch special through 3 pm on weekdays is an excellent deal."}
{"text":"Can honestly say I was surprised big time! Driven by a number of times and never once thought to stop. Thanks to Yelp and getting out of work late, decided to stop in and get some takeout.
Was a bit skeptical when we pulled up as the place is pretty dull and there were zero cars in front. Almost thought they were closed. Walked in and it is a nice size place with very outdated furniture and decor. Only one couple was sat down to eat (at almost 7pm that was a bit worrisome to me). They had a nice menu with your typical Thai fare. Pricing was about average for Thai food, a bit pricey to me for the look of the place. I wasn't feeling very bold, so I stuck to the basics and ordered chicken fried rice (one of my favorite dishes and a good judge for me of whether the place is worth coming back to). Kacey ordered the Chicken Pad See-Eew. At $9 for each dish, it was a pretty decent size portion.
My fried rice was one of the best I've had in Vegas, especially once I added a little bit of soy sauce. Wow! I ate the entire portion and was still craving more. I did wish it had a bit more chicken, but that may just be me being greedy. Kacey seemed to really enjoy her dish as well and had no complaints.
Needs major updating in the restaurant and I honestly am not sure how they stay in business if they only had once couple in that big restaurant during dinner hours. But they gained a new customer and we will be back soon to try more! Will stick to take-out though as I don't think I would enjoy my meal sitting in that dining room."}
{"text":"Love this place my go to for yelp eats delivery. Have Never had a bad meal. Always delivers earlier than expected, hot and food quality is excellent!!!"}
{"text":"I've never eaten here, but when I was working until 11 pm it was a godsend to quench my pad thai and thai iced tea thirst. Restaurant definitely leaves something to be desired as far as decor, but if you've eaten at an older china town establishment, you'll be able to eat here. Service is friendly and quick. After the second time I ordered, the staff was well acquainted with what I wanted, who I was, and I was welcomed personally. That can be a nice thing or maybe a hint you need to cook more at home. Dishes are reasonably priced and they give you quite a bit of food. If you're in the area or even headed home from work, I can't recommend this place more."}
{"text":"Coming from California, i was in desperate need of a GO TO thai restaurant, and after trying 
out many Thai places, I finally found the one! This place is amazing for the price, offers delivery, grub hub, and the customer service is spot on. couldn't give em anything less than 5 stars ! everyone is so so friendly and open and the food leaves me full and content everytime. I get something new everytime and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite Thai spot in town!

Everything is delicious, but the spicy mint chicken (pad kapao) is my choice in town, and I have ordered it in every place I go.  Also, their drunken noodles (pad kee mao) is my fav in town as well.  They have a nice varient with crab meat that is super sweet and spicy at the same time!  Mouth is watering as I write!

We have also tried some curry dishes and a few others, and they all have been delicious.  Good thai tea...Nothing bad here so far...truth!

The waitress is very friendly and so is the rest of the staff.  

Give it a try and see for yourself...this might be your new Thai restaurant :)"}
{"text":"We were on our way to Utah and decided to make a stop at this restaurant for dinner. We all shared a few dishes including the Egg rolls, Curry, Pad Thai, Tom Yum soup and I had a Thai tea as a beverage. Within a couple minutes of walking out of this restaurant I experienced severe stomach cramping to the point I was screaming in pain. We had to pull over and I began to violently vomit in a bag while crying in pain for almost 45 minutes. I seriously considered going to the ER. No one else in our group was affected from the food we shared, leaving me to think that there was something wrong with my Thai tea I consumed. I am a big fan of Thai food and eat it regularly at other places back home and have never had this type of reaction. I find what happened HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS . ... and would NOT recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai here is addicting! It's a really great dish here. However, the portions are very small. They use thinner noodles than most pad thais use. Their green curry is also very good but the meat is a tad on the dry side. The papaya salad was just alright though, the portion was very very small. I've been here two times and haven't been disappointed. Our server lady was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall. This place is BOMB ! 
Shrimp soup was bomb , tempura shrimp, cashew , etc. definitely coming back !"}
{"text":"This is always a great place for some thai as a backup.  My wife and I have been going here about once every 2-3 months for the last 5 years.  They've gone through a little bit of inconsistencies in food quality in the past, but in the last year or so it's been pretty good.

LOVE the yellow curry chicken."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was even better!  Pork Larb was fresh, Chicken Curry was flavorful yet light, and the Chinese Broccoli w/ Mushrooms was delicious and healthy.  We came in late and were probably the last guests, but our server was still so sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"Always delicious.  We order from Krung Thai to our work atleAst 3 times a week. Panang curry with tofu and pad see ew with tofu no egg!  If you haven't been there I definitely recommend it. Just watch out for the spicy  levels. Sometimes it's a little hot!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre and overpriced Thai cuisine, in my opinion. Tried it because my friend lives near-by and because I'm always game for trying a new Thai place! I love 

Thai cuisine and have a few staples that I order at every new place I try to see how these compare--well Krung Thai fell right in the average range. Tom Kha Kai soup was tasty, but duck dish seemed heated in a microwave, was unusually greasy and even a bit cold on edges. Unacceptable. Other tried meat dishes were nothing spectacular, just edible. 

I did enjoy the \"cheesy, hole-in-a-wall\" atmosphere and service was timely, but not spectacular by any means. Had to wait for my water to be refilled once for quite a while...

The worst part about this restaurant are the prices. I found most to be overpriced, especially since portion sizes are rather small. I also did not like the \"fast-food-like\" menus with pictures. I thought that too many \"Chinese-inspired\" foods were offered, and not enough Thai dishes were present. 

I may come back here to try it again since my friend lives near-by, but only for this reason. I would not recommend this place unless you are in the general vicinity and don' t mind paying top dollar for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Great thai spot for late night dining.close to the strip.not expensive.the thai karioke is very funny."}
{"text":"I just love the lunch special and the staff is very nice!!! The pad thai shrimp and thai ice coffee extra milk was so delicious we will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is fresh, staff is friendly and its always easy to get a table."}
{"text":"This review is based on my most recent visit (February 13, 2016). 
I first came here in July, 2014, right after they opened I believe. Scant décor, basically just some tables and chairs, and my Mom and I had a fantastic dinner. I came back several times with visiting friends and locals between then and September, 2015. I saw the banquettes go in, the stage added, etc. Each time my friends were thoroughly delighted with the food, and I loved the Pad Thai. It was kind of funny that the drinks were out of a can, and that one guy was the host(ess), server, and cashier for the entire restaurant, but the food was 5 star all the way. 
Fast forward to my February visit, an early Valentines with my out of town love. Admittedly, it was 5 months since my last visit. I don't know what happened, maybe the chef got hired away, or called in sick? IDK, but my Pad Thai was awful, and yellow!?! My love's dish was also worthless. Neither of us ate, but we didn't have the heart to challenge the server who as usual was wearing all the hats and seemed very busy even though there were very few customers.
Maybe it was just a bad, correction: very bad night. But I am reluctant to go back again after having been so disappointed, not to mention embarrassed that I really gushed about this restaurant in advance."}
{"text":"Another note worthy Thai restaurant, food is very tasty and the prices are fair.


\"Rub a dub dub!\""}
{"text":"Best fried rice and pad see ew. Oh and the Thai ice tea is refreshing on a hot summer night. 

What I really liked was also the live music playing in the background.  Good atmosphere, good food, good music makes for a good night. 

Will love to be back."}
{"text":"I have never done take out on Yelp but for the first one I am so please. Perfectly spicy, great food, and quick delivery. If I could add an extra tip after the fact, I certainly would."}
{"text":"The food tasted amazing but 1 hour into the trip home both my daughter and I started developing very clear signs of food poisoning! Bleh. My husband had a small bout and mine was over in a day but my daughter suffered for 3 days. Straight to a one star for this one. My poor baby. 
I tipped a good 25% on our order and the service was great buuuut... I'll try to recreate this taste at home because no way will I risk this again.
I really wanted to love this place because the food tasted so good :("}
{"text":"This place is so awesome. the food is sooo delicious. i just ordered food from this place and i know for sure the main ingredient to every dish was love. my taste buds died and went to heaven every time i took a bite. I bet whoever makes this food cries every time a dish leaves the kitchen because they care about their food so much. I tasted the love and it is delicious. it was so fresh and they got to my house so quickly. its like they were waiting for me to call. I have also gone to this restaurant and it is so cute and cozy and the ladies who work there are so sweet and nice. please eat here. it will make your soul happy."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me over a year to try this place since its so close to my apartment.  I've managed to go there 4 times in the last month!  Good stuff.  Just a warning to you all...level 5 spice is nothing to mess with...the tom yum gun soup was ridiculously hot!!!!

My wife always goes with one of the shrimp curries.  I've gone all noodle with everything being awesome.  

I would imagine karaoke would be pretty fun(ny) here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I remember each and every time I have come here because the food is always delicious and they are beyond friendly. They have to be the nicest people at a restaurant I have ever met and that's them every single time I go so I know it's just a nice place. Definitely recommend the Pad Se Ew and the crab fried rice together."}
{"text":"In this corner of Las Vegas is a nicely spaced thai restaurant with food you can definitely get a good munch on.

They have mango sticky rice that could have better presentation but none the less taste great. They have a stage i guess for karaoke or for a band so this definitely jumps when it it's in the evening. Yeah definitely worth comjng back.

Especially for the nice cgopped pieces of steak."}
{"text":"Would have liked to given this 3.5 stars, but settled on 3. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. I will still come back when I'm in the mood for thai. The yellow curry was spicy, but wasn't packed with flavor. Slightly more soupy than I like and the potatoes were a little too undercooked."}
{"text":"This place is off the hook good!  We've visited many times and every single time, everything we order is awesome.  Their soups are great, the salads are awesome.  Pad Thai noodle is perfect, curries are great.  This is one excellent place to visit if you are craving good thai food in Vegas."}
{"text":"My boyfriend And I were looking for a good Thai place and found this on Yelp. The food is clean, organic, and delicious! We didn't feel sluggish or tired, we felt great and we'll definitely come back for another grubbin!"}
{"text":"pretty tasty Pad Thai and Pad Se Ew.  Wait staff were very friendly and attentive!  Prices were spot on too"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I LOVE this place. We go here at least once a week. They have the best lunch specials in the area, delicious and affordable. Our favorites are the mint chili chicken or the pad thai. They have delicious thai tea.  

During lunch hour it doesn't get too busy and the service is always great. 

I believe they have a live band some nights. I've never been but I wouldn't doubt it's great. 

Highly recommend this place if you like thai for a great price with great service."}
{"text":"When we were vacationing in Vegas four years ago, we stopped by here and ordered takeout.  Everything was delicious.  On a recent trip with family, I decided to dine here again.  Place was half crowded around 7pm but they only had one server so she was running around a bit.  My sister always ordered the squid salad and used this dish to compare and contrast with other Thai restaurants.  We agreed that it was decent but another place nearby prepared it much better.  I ordered the shrimp in clear vermicelli noodle.  It was ok.  I don't know maybe we've eaten at so many Thai restaurants lately our taste have become refined.  In any case, I'd rate this place 7/10 on taste alone.  Pricing is on par with nearby restaurants."}
{"text":"Krung Thai is probably one of the best Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. The food is good and pretty authentic. They even serve roti for dessert (okay, so that's really Indian, but you can find it everywhere in Bangkok). 

The atmosphere is okay. The place is decently decorated, there is a dance floor (but I've never seen anyone dancing), and there is live music (English and Thai) almost every night. I don't go here for the décor though; it's for the food. 

I can't get enough of their chicken/eggplant dish. Yummy."}
{"text":"pretty good... shrimp fried rice was excellent, nice wok-y onion flavor, n very good red penang curry. one of the best red currys ive had. i would like to try more to see if i can give them more stars!

their business is super slow during lunch, but service is fast... cant wait to go back for dinner. but i will be prepared to pay. i do think it is a little expensive... for shrimp fried rice and penang chicken curry & 1 thai iced coffee the bill came to $26, so i left $30.

i have been to lotus of siam which is like sooooo popular here, but i think that place is over rated. ya the food is good, but when i eat there im on the toilet half the night with a sour tummy sooooo that tells me theyre not very clean.

this place on the other hand... no tummy aches :) 
price sucks, food is good. its satisfying."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy, I've got pad thai in my tummy. 

Excellent service, PHANtastic pad thai (see what I did there?), I loved the thai tea, and got out hot noodley awesomeness in about 7 minutes from ordering. I shalllllllll return."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants that we have ever tried.

Current favorites include:
- Duck Fried Rice .. sooooo delicious
- Duck Salad
- Duck with Basil (Is there a pattern here?)
- Panang style chicken Curry 
- Massaman style Chicken curry

Granted, we haven't tried the majority of the dishes that they serve, but we've definitely enjoyed everything that we have tried so far.

The staff has been very very friendly every time that we have visited them, sure, that's what Thai folks are known for, their friendliness, but these guys are even friendlier than most.  A definite must-try.

Edit - After a recent re-visitand the great experience we had there with the incredibly friendly staff and the consistently great food I decided to bump up my rating to 4.5*"}
{"text":"I got the pad kee mao and my noodles were a little hard and bland. My friend got pad thai style noodles with crab on top, and his noodles were delicious. Service was friendly albeit slow considering we were the only party there..."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out and was a little disappointed I had to wait longer than the wait time I was given and it was pretty empty in there too. The restaurant is extremely outdated and definitely needs a make over. They have a band and a small dance area, not sure if people really use it, but I thought it was funny how the two guys up there kept encouraging customers to come up and sing karaoke. 

The food was good, but a little spicy for my family who have no tolerance for spicy food. I had specifically requested for not spicy on all the entrees, and cilantro was added to my tom yung koong against my wishes (my sister is allergic). Staff was very nice though and apologized for the longer wait time."}
{"text":"Standard Thai Fare, nice service and food. 

Krung Thai isn't much to look at from outside. It looks vacant and dark. Kinda looks the same from the inside. The service is friendly and helpful. We ordered the pork pad thai and yellow curry with chicken. Both were satisfying and had just the right amount of spice. The thai tea is subtle and not too sweet. Just the way I like it.

As many other Yelpers have said in previous reviews, the prices are only slightly higher than most other Thai restaurants in town. Nothing too horrible, but noticeable. I wish they were a little more generous with the rice. They give  you a very small scoop to go with your dish. I like rice, and lots of it.

Very happy with the food here, just a few upgrades and it would definitely be a 4 star review all the way. I can never resist Thai food. I look forward to trying more dishes here, especially their soups, noodles and curries."}
{"text":"This is low key a really great restaurant if there interior was redesigned. It just reminds me of grandma's home with flamboyant decors. And sometimes, on the dance floor parks a bike. Uhm, what?! Now you might be wondering what's going on here? Why would you come back time and time again for food there? Because it's freaking delicious. 

My go-to meal is the chicken yellow curry that never seizes to disappoint. At $6.99, this lunch special is the most amazing. Potatoes are always cooked just right and the carrots too. But the best part for me is the curry sauce. It's sweet and salt with a hint of spice that I can never get tired of! Ever. Pair it with a side of rice and you're in for a treat. 

I'm also a great fan of there tom ka kai and pineapple fried rice. I always get the two together because that's the ultimate pair! Seriously, consider trying it. I tastes homemade like what mama would cook after a long day. Salute to that meal."}
