{"text":"My favourite steakhouse in the GTA.  One of the top that I have ever eaten at, and can match the steak quality and flavor of steakhouses many times their price.

A hidden gem, but with decor straight out of the 70s.  Best personalized, old school service in Toronto.  Amazing value.

Don't miss the rib steak, Zorro's cut prime rib (omg meat butter), or the blue cheese salad dressing. The seafood dinner for 2 is massive and impressive, but could be better.

Table side Caesar salad from scratch can't be beat.  Flamed Spanish coffee also prepared at table side for some firey entertainment.

I make my way out of downtown Toronto to visit this steakhouse over any of the downtown steakhouses including Harbour 60, barbarians or Morton's etc.

The only critique I have is that the veggie sides could be improved, but the baked potato is still good."}
{"text":"Zorro's was highly RECOMMENDED by a friend who is a CHEF and CATERER. I'd like to give you more than 5 stars as it was a wonderful evening!

I hosted the dinner with clients as a recognition event. It was a fantastic dining experience - from the woman at the coat check, woman who greeted us at the reservation desk, gentleman who guided us to the table, the waiter, bus boy (a mature man) and of course the food! 

Humungous portions - glad we didn't order an appetizer! We all had steak and they were cooked to PERFECTION. The sauces were delicious.

And, the bathrooms were immaculate! (Sorry but as  woman I notice these things)

The only comment -- you need to get a new webiste and soon -- it does not meet your professional image. I couldn't \"copy\" the address and the map wasn't viewable."}
{"text":"giving it a 3+.  Nice food, nice service.  Ambiance is dated and stuffy.  Octagon is way better in ambiance and the whole experience."}
{"text":"Great steak ,nice service! I just had a wonderful dinner there with my husband, I ordered a rib steak and he ordered a New York strip, both of the steaks are excellent, even prices are a little bit hight, but they have a high quality, old school style design, we love it...and here is much more valuable compared with House of Chan! Both of us enjoyed the experience in there, we'll back in futures~~"}
{"text":"Just like other yelpers described - Zorro's is located at a borderline sketchy neighbourhood where there are many strip clubs, out of no where, you will find this really old school steak and seafood restaurant. (Their servers look like they have been working at this restaurant since beginning of time too) 

It's obvious enough that their specialty is STEAK. If you like to old school char grilled steak, you will love Zorro's. Also, please make sure you are very hungry, their portions are huge! I went with my family last night, we ordered the Zorro's Platter for two, which has two pieces for filet mignon and a bunch of scallops, king crab legs, king prawn....we shared between three people, but still have left overs to bring home. So this can definitely serve 4 ladies or 2 very hungry men or 3 not so hungry men.

Each entree comes with a salad and potato. I highly recommended you to try their Cesar salad, that's their best salad, the other salad they just use off the shelf salad dressing. Beside from the huge steak, they also bring up a big basket of warm garlic bread (which is very tempting), and a plate of pickle/olives. 

What I don't like there is their garnish.... the boiled broccoli and carrots look really boring. 

Tips - I heard Costco sells gift certificates of this restaurant, you get 20% off if you buy two."}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant. Good wine selection, food was exquisite. Had the 8oz filet which was cooked to perfection. Service was amazing, friendly, attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"Great steak! if your hungry for steak and you are feeling like a larger portion, look no further than Zorro's Steakhouse, the place looks dated but comfortable takes you back to the 1970's but besides, Great food, decent pricing for steak house and I'm certain you'll enjoy, Try it you'll love it.."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. The seafood platter for two is epic. Outstanding quality taste, value atmosphere and service. Superior to any chain steakhouse by far!"}
{"text":"Walking into Zorro's was like stepping back in time. The dinner was superb. Peppercorn Steak was flawless Ribs Veal and Salmon were top notch. Great garlic bread. The waiters were true professionals with great sense of humor.  Best of all it was quiet you could have easy conversation across the table."}
{"text":"My first time to Zorro's but my grandparents used to go all the time in the 70's.....and I don't think they've changed the d√©cor or uniforms since!   On a main street in an industrial park surrounded by strip clubs, I wasn't too sure about this place..... BUT there is a reason they have been around since the 70's. 
Went with 6 guys before a boxing match - seemed fitting to eat a big chunk of meat! 
Service - 5 star.  The staff knew every ingredient, and were knowledgeable about there wines. 
Food - bang on.   Couldn't have cooked it better myself!   It comes with a massive relish tray.  Portions of everything were huge.   The lamb was perfect and our table of six raved about the rib eye,  steak Neptune, and prime rib.   
Price- not too over the top considering there were 4 waiters for our table,  and the wine wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be (we were drinking the amarone )
I'd go back again regardless of the decor. .. kind of added to the fun of the evening."}
{"text":"This place has always been great.  The service is second to none and the food is phenomenal.  Yes, the look is a bit different but it is the look of a traditional steak house.   Great service."}
{"text":"Best Steak, Seafood And Garlic Bread in TO!
Love Love Love this place. We are regulars here. The staff is friendly and sociable. The prices are extremely reasonable. It kind of feels like you are eating in a medieval dining room. We had the mermaid's plate and it was out of this world!"}
{"text":"Zorros is a staple in Toronto/MISSISSAUGA area. Offering classic steakhouse food. The prime rib is the most succulent piece of meat I've ever had. Caesar salad is made table side, which is the best Caesar salad I've ever had.  The service is outstanding to say the least. Good atmosphere, excellent service and incredible food."}
{"text":"I keep coming back. As good as it gets in Toronto. If Anthony Bourdain featured this restaurant (as he should have in his 'Toronto' edition) he would have given this restaurant five (5) large Stars. It's 'old school', table side service, attentive and professional waiters that make your meal seamless by way of timing. I wish we had something like this in California but we don't so that's why when I'm in Toronto, I always go to Zorro's."}
{"text":"My go to place for Prime Rib, a little out of the way but this old school restaurant does not disappoint.

Pro tip: Prime Rib sells out quick on weekends. If you want it go early.  On weekdays it's available almost through the whole night.   Also the house wine is a huge glass of red wine."}
{"text":"Great spot near the airport. Definitely old style. But plenty of food including garlic bread pickles & olives. Warm dining room. Sit by the fire as you warm up. Waiters very helpful & friendly. No beer on tap though. We had strip steak & fillet both more than enough food. Great conversation place although cell service in and out."}
{"text":"I went to Zorro's with a vendor group and was not disappointed.  This place is a traditional steak and chop house with all the fixings included.  We started off with a great bottle of red wine and the crudite plates which included dill pickles and kalamata olives...odd addition at a steak house but they were good.  The garlic bread is amazing but don't fill up on it because the food just keeps coming and coming!  I started out with a house salad with their special blue cheese vinagarette...AMAZING!  Tons of cheese and great flavor.  Next my entree came which was a huge ribeye steak, cooked perfectly to medium rare (the only way to eat a steak) with a nice flavorful char on the outside.  And then came the buffet of food along with it...asparagus, carrots, giant baked potato, garlic mushrooms and of course more delicious garlic bread!  You DON'T need any side dishes.  

The lamb chops that my friend got were even more amazing and I was having some major food envy.  I don't think there is really a bad dish on the menu.  

The only downfall was that it was a little pricey but you also get a ton of food for your $40-60 dinner."}
{"text":"Best prime rib in the gta hands down. The portion you get is huge and the meat is so tender and worth penny"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this place tonight for our first anniversary dinner and we had an amazing time.

The restaurant was busy but not overcrowded. Our reservations were for 7pm and we didn't have to wait for than a few seconds to be seated.

We had the broiled, bacon wrapped scallops for an appetiser and steak with scampi shrimp for main courses as well as a Cesar salad for myself.

The food was outstanding. I've been to Zorro's in the past, yet I still remain amazed with their food. The service was also amazing. Never once did my drink empty or my water glass need refilling before someone was there to ask if I would like another. I opted out of sour cream for my baked potato and 3 seperate people asked if I would like some or anything else - the level of care they all showed in making sure we were happy was second to none.

This is an expensive place - it's the most I've ever spent on a dinner for 2 ($240) but it was worth every cent.

My only comment that could be anything less than thrilled was that the parking lot in front the restaurant was full of wood. Firewood I believe. I have no idea why and it wasn't the biggest deal in the world, but some good parking was taken up and our cab couldn't even drop us at the front door because of how much wood there was.

Outside of that, it was pretty close to perfect."}
{"text":"Excellent old world style Steakhouse in an industrial area full of big box buildings. Top notch steaks and salads.

Definitely a gem buried in an area that you wouldn't think would yield a restaurant like this. 

Ive been there 3 times now and the first 2 I had a steak and it was perfectly cooked. The last time I went my lamb was over-cooked and they couldn't do enough to make it right. Great service."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've come and even on valentine's they are impressive. Generous portions, fast service and great food."}
{"text":"Celebrating my wedding anniversary we went to Zorros as we know it's always a quality meal. Mr Zygouras, our server, and his support staff were amazing. I had the petit fillet with baked potato and my husband had the Zorros cut prime rib. We asked for medium and it was cooked perfectly. The warm garlic bread brought through out our meal was amazing. Can't go wrong. Old world charm at its finest. I almost forgot. We were give a complimentary piece of cake in celebration of our anniversary."}
{"text":"One of Toronto's original Old school Greek steakhouses. Epic steaks. Steakhouse atmosphere. Great service."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  My dad used to work in the area and when we used to go to other steak houses, he would always rave about Zorro's.  So it was a pleasant discovery to find this restaurant.  Don't let the street confuse you...the store front is definitely diverse (the street starts with a strip club and leads to zorro's).

This place was all penguin(you know...servers in white shirt and black everything else?).  Tables are tightly squeezed together but are the old fashioned round and largish...mine seated 5 and was intimate but there were tables that could seat 10.

The dishes are meaty in nature and american in size...meaning they are big.  If you go in a group of 5, you are probably eating half a cow...yes, that big a portion....

The food is good to great.  I had the rib eye..which literally needed two plates.  Friends had steaks.  All aligned that the food was well done and to our respective liking.  

A friend of mine has this...thing...with his girlfriend.  If a restaurant offers French onion soup, they HAVE to eat it.  So in the course of his multi year relationship, he has tried many, many, many didisay many, French onion soups.  

Zorro's has french onion soup.  He rated it in the top 3....and I would agree (though I only really have tried French onion soup 3 times in my life...probably).

Overall it misses the 5th star because while the cost reflects the portions, it's a waste.  They could do more with less...after all aren't we all trying to live in a better world? And if you like medium to rare meat, I don't know if taking it hope is a great idea...IMHO."}
{"text":"Dancing on the border of Brampton/Mississauga, and uncomfortably sandwiched amongst a pair of strip clubs and truck stop diners, you'll find this gem of a restaurant.

I've been to Zorro's a few times now, and it gets better every time I'm there. Call me old-school, but I just love how old fashioned the place is designed, how the employees are all suited up, and they're all so friendly without being invasive. A tad pricey, sure, but it's well worth it.

The food is amazing. From the BBQ ribs, filet mignon, veal parm, peppercorn steak, hell, even their garlic bread is delicious. Shockingly, the highlight for me is always their salad. I don't know what they put in that dressing, but it's incredible. I'm getting stomach howls just thinking about it.

You'll definitely want to make a reservation, as I've never been there when it wasn't pretty packed.

Check it out. You won't be sorry.

Note: The name of the place is very misleading. If you swing into the restaurant on a chandelier, it's kind of frowned upon."}
{"text":"Liars. They closed early and the servers were sitting around shooting the breeze.

Left to scramble for something to eat"}
{"text":"Located in a slightly remote area, Zorro's has a very antique-y feel inside with mosaic windows, textured walls, and vintage-feeling armchairs. Definitely an older crowd, both diners and waiters. It was very heartwarming to see so many precious older couples dining at this establishment. The waiters were all extremely friendly and sweet. 

Complimentary appetizers included olives, pickles, and a large basket of garlic bread (extremely garlicky - breaking a piece in half felt like squeezing a lemon from all the garlic juice that dispensed onto my plate but it still tasted guiltily good). 

Ordered the single tail lobster entree which came with buttery rice, a salad, and a bowl of steamed vegetables. The vinaigrette dressing that came with my salad was a little overwhelmingly sour but the steamed vegetables was nicely prepared with some gravy-esque sauce on it. The lobster and the rice were both very good as well."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a special occasion after hearing about it for a couple of years.  The reviews on here are fairly consistent and true but I'll add my two cents on a couple of things.

First, yes the look is outdated but that is part of the charm of this 40 year old restaurant.  The decor also speaks to its history as an established steakhouse - very dark etc.  Service is impeccable in my mind - our water was refilled frequently and more than a few employees stopped by to see how everything was going.

Food is generally expensive although the list of their 'popular items' is much more reasonable.  One of us ordered the lamb, which looked excellent.  Someone else had the seafood pasta which was large and full of seafood and the other had scallops which were plentiful.  I had the junior steak, which I'm sure was around 8oz and it was cooked well although the lack of seasoning was a tad disappointing.  

You will not leave here hungry with the huge basket of garlic bread offered to the table as well as olives and pickles.  Salads come with most meals and are fairly big as well.  The candy dish at the exit is a cute touch.

Overall, as a place that's been operating in an odd area for over 40 years, Zorro's may be expensive but it's worth checking out.  I'm sure it's family run and most of their staff has been around for a long time - you don't find that much anymore.  Is it Toronto's best steakhouse?  Probably not.  But it's pretty darn good."}
{"text":"went back to Zorros again on Sunday, and as always the prime rib was excellent.  Other people in our group tried the salmon and said it was excellent, and my son polished off a sirloin.  Once again the service was attentive and professional, and everything was good.  I dont mind paying the bill when the food is so good.  Next time i think i will have to take a new entre choice and try the lobster or the ribs.  Both looked amazing.  We will be back again soon"}
{"text":"Staying in Brampton for the week, went to yelp for a good steak. Found Zorro's talk about a blast from the past. Got the steak sammy, Id never seen pickles and butter on the same plate, random yes but good. Total was around 19 for a pop, with the sammy i got a amazing bowl of seafood soup. With the dish a huge salad and fries, seeing how Canada is an expensive place in general I thought 19 was a great deal. Amazing service, waiters are straight from Italy. I loved this place will go back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Dinner for four on a busy Friday night.  First, I want to say the the service was very good.  From what I could tell it was mainly older gentlemen waiters.  
I ordered the Zorro cut of prime rib, and it was just okay - not the best.  One of our crew ordered theirs medium rare and it was more like well done - however, they exchanged it gladly and he was happy with his new cut.  Caesars salad was good.  Ordered a Long Island Iced Tea and it was very sour, like a lemonade with just a bit of unknown liquor.  The Stella was good though."}
{"text":"All the food was great but the prime rib was the best I have ever had..."}
{"text":"Our friends recommended Zorro's a couple of years ago but we never got to try it until recently to celebrate my birthday. I was craving for steak and immediately thought of Zorro's. The restaurant has an old-school steakhouse feel which is quite appealing. I had the 10 oz. NY strip steak and my husband had the Rib steak. My steak was very delicious but my husband's steak was so far the best steak I've had in a long time if not ever. The edges of the rib steak were slightly charred which was perfect for me. The marbling made the meat so juicy. Our orders came with buttered toasts, salad, some marinated olives and some sides which I can't remember. My husband thinks they should improve the side dishes a little bit. I am thinking they probably do not want the sides dishes to steal the show. Whatever the reason, their steaks are worth trying out. 

I thought I should mention that we went there with our 11-month old daughter. When we asked for a high chair, they gave us an extra cushion to place on top of the regular seat. This would have been fine for a slightly older toddler but not for a baby. They apparently don't have high chairs so we ended up holding her the entire time we were having dinner."}
{"text":"Zorros!!! Wow !!! Doesn't get any better, from the service to the fine cuisine it just doesn't get better and classier than Zorros.  We're three generations now to boast their excellence. Thank you Zorros for every special occasion we've ever celebrated so exquisitely.

{"text":"Had lunch with team at work

Steak was amazing

They make ceasar salad infront of you

Loved it

Interesting decor, spacious private room, ample parking

Service was good"}
{"text":"Zorros's is lovely, unique and welcoming. Their steaks are amazing, they make the salad at the table and their staff are some of the best ive ever met, they go well above and beyond! I dropped one star as i we got a bad cut of steak once or twice but overall they are one of the best restaurants in the city"}
{"text":"Have only been to Zorro's Steakhouse once for my cousin's father's birthday dinner. Food is exquisite, little pricey for my budget.

Cesar salad was rich, some complained to have too much dressing, didn't bother me. Steak and shrimp main course, cheesecake for dessert both delicious."}
{"text":"this steakhouse started our in 1975 and is still going on strong. They start you off with a toasted garlic bread (large basket full) with a tray of black olives, pickles and butter.
if you buy a steak you get a plain house salad with choice of dressing, i choose french and it was spicy yet fantastic.your meal also comes with a side of vegatbles and choice of rice, fries or baked potatoe. i ordered a rib steak medium well andit was awesome. would go again and i am not suprised its been open so long, the service and food are to die for...."}
{"text":"I have only been to Zorro's twice and must say I give 2 thumbs up.  For those of you that have been there know that the d√©cor is smack out of the 70's and for those of you have not been there now you know.  Don't let the 70's d√©cor fool you because I guarantee you that it will be once of the best steak houses that you have been to.  The wait staff is incredible great service and very old school service.  Dressed in bow ties and when you order salads they mix the salad for you right in from of you.  Now let's get to the meat.  Ohhhh the meat lol.  Well my last visit I ordered the rib eye steak.  Looking at the price is was about the same as the other steaks on the menu so I figured it was 12 to 14 oz.  The menu did not say how big it actually was.  When the steak arrived I almost fell off my chair.  I come to find out it was 32oz.  Yes I said it 32oz.  I asked the waiter why it doesn't say it on the menu and he told me because it varies on the day but the cuts are usually from 26 to 35 oz.  Non the less I dug in.  The steak was cooked to perfection.  Hands down some of the best service and best steak.

BEWARE if you are a light eater don't get the Rib Eye or ask how big it is that day first LOL."}
{"text":"The very friendly staff at our twilight zone-ish hotel recommended that my better half and I eat at Zorro's for dinner.   As we had already experienced the horror of eating lunch (if \"lunch\" is defined as \"something edible served around noon\" anyway) at the hotel, anything would have been better - so we took their advice.  

Being a Thursday night and 9pm no less, we were both surprised to see a reasonably full parking lot when we pulled up and a fairly busy restaurant when we entered.   It is decorated in an old Italian/Mediterranean the style (maybe as I am no expert) - very warm, earthy and inviting.

We were immediately greeted and seated at a four-top in the corner in a low lit room and within minutes, our busser showed up with garlic bread and water and then entered our waiter.   As a rule of thumb, I have noticed that whenever my waiter was over sixty and seemed happy, the restaurant always turned out to be great.  It only makes sense that for someone at that age to be a waiter and be happy must mean that he likes what he is doing and importantly, be able to support himself and family doing it.   If the restaurant were bad, he would make a meager living; have a wife and family that were stressing him; and, live a miserable existence.

Our waiter was at least sixty and our busser in his late thirties.

We started with Pellegrino and double dirties as we perused the extensive menu.  The first problem I had was the wine menu is much too large for such a small mind as my own.  We ended up settling on the Penfolds Hyland Shiraz as it was familiar but was impressed that seeing my consternation, the waiter offered suggestions when we got to the menu.  I am glad we took his suggestion.

Two people - a buck forty - get the platter for two: crab legs, lobster, scallops, shrimp scampi, filet mignon and baby back ribs...and then the fillers - rice, veggies and salad (he let us switch our Greek for Caesar and made it at the table.)  Gluttony in 3D but YOLO.

So with the second bottle of wine, (what felt like) twenty pounds heavier, we dined for three hours and got out with tip for right under three.   This is definitely not what we can afford to do every night but if you get a chance to actually dine with your better half, significant other, soul mate, etc. - this is the place to do it."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem near the Toronto international airport.  The location is a bit sketchy as it is surrounded by strip clubs and the decor is outdated.  However, the food was great!  I ordered the Shrimp scampi and I never knew shrimp could taste so good! It had the texture of a lobster.  My companion had a steak and i had a bite of it and it was scrumptious.  The Caesar salad table-side was delicious as well.  One star lost only because of the outdated furniture and location. I must add that another good thing about this place is that there are no patronizing staff in this restaurant.  Come dressed casually, and the waiters will still serve you as if it were a special occasion.  As it should be, because, we patrons are still paying the same amount as everyone else dressed formally.  Besides, sometimes, I just want a good steak after a long day of errands/ working/ working out.   I came in yoga pants and felt really comfortable.  My real rating is 4.5 for this establishment."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this place using the hand held GPS in the rental car and am I ever glad we did. We searched Steak & Seafood and up came Zorro's. The restaurant is very old school, but it was pleasant. Great for a family as well, although we only went as two. The meal was pretty cool, it started with a huge platter of pickles, olives and bread. We picked away at that while we waited for the meal. The menu offered a bunch of stuff that we wanted to try, but we settled on the Zorro's Platter For Two. It was delicious and it was huge. We never even came close to finishing it. Crab legs, lobster tail, shrimp scampi, scallops, Filet Mignon and BBQ back ribs. Served with rice and vegetables. 
So close to the airport that if you have a long enough layover, then you should go."}
{"text":"Short and to the point - this place was recommended by the front desk at my hotel, and had good yelp reviews, so I figured I'd give it a go. My tableside Caesar wasn't made tableside, my steak order was put on when my salad was delivered, and the service felt very rushed. I sat down for a nice relaxing dinner, and was out in less than 45 minutes, and really felt that the server would have liked to cut that down some.  To be fair, he was very polite. The steak was well prepared and seasoned, which is why they get 3 stars - but that's rather expected of a steak house, no? I visit Toronto several times a year for business, but I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"Huge portions wow. So stuffed. The sole was divine, fresh and quite large. Suggest sharing when you go. 
The shrimp cocktail was also quite big. The smoked salmon was average. Wouldn't get that the future. The service is very fast. Suggest telling your server to slow down so you can enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"We were celebrating a special occasion and chose Zorro's over the Keg.  I'm so glad we did.  The food and service was amazing.  Great portion sizes and attentive staff. 

Most of us had steak which was a great cut and cooked to perfection.  There are some nice additional touches which set this restaurant apart from other steakhouses.  You are provided a basket of garlic bread (real bread - not breadsticks) for the table, olives and pickles to start.  Each entree also comes with a salad and choice of additional side.  I don't like baked potatoes so chose the rice and it was very good.  Caesar salad is made table-side if you choose it and was also good.  Nothing but great things to say about this place.  It's a bit more expensive than the Keg but the service, food, and little extras make it more than worth it.  

We will be going again soon!"}
{"text":"Went there Saturday with friends. The place itself looks very nice. It was very busy. The place is very crowded, every table is very close to each other.  It was hard to have a conversation as it was very loud.   The customer service was just ok.  They were too quick and not very professional. Some of us didn't even start the salad as we were working on the appetizers and they took the salad away. Without even asking if we were done. We had to tell the waiter to bring it back as we did try it yet. The food itself was ok. French onion soup was ok. Little too salty for me. Escargot were very good (although I didn't try it) stake 'n lobster plate was huge and it was good. The rib stake (which was ordered by friends) was huge and they really enjoyed it.  The Dover sole was okay and my halibut stake was nothing special, kind of bland. I liked the specialty coffee."}
{"text":"With so many other places to get a steak I hadn't been to Zorro's since New Year's Eve over 25 years ago. But then I noticed $100 gift certificates available at Costco for $80 and that triggered new interest. I did find it curious to see since it's not uncommon for failing restaurants to attempt Groupon and Entertainment offers as a desperate effort to survive. Nevertheless, my brothers and I had started a new tradition last year of two of us treating the third to an expensive birthday dinner, so for my turn it was Zorro's.

The food was about even with most other high-end steakhouses which is to say it was good (which for the high price should be expected) but not necessarily unforgettable. What WAS unforgettable, however, was the incredible and incredulous treatment by ownership on a subsequent visit when presenting \"a coupon.\"

Firstly, the Costco offer seemingly had done for the restaurant exactly what was intended. I hadn't been to Zorro's in a quarter century and was back with plans to return for all of our brothers' dinners. One of my brothers had now booked a party there with over 20 people, and my other brother was having a family dinner there all based on the fact that Costco sold gift certificates for Zorro's. That's when it all fell apart.

Zorro's accepted a request to substitute two steaks as part of a Zorro's platter for two and the sides of the platter for a small pasta dish for a 3-year old for a \"small up charge\" which we are all accustomed to and of course agreed. When my brother received the bill it vaguely indicated \"open food\" for various items in the amount of $9, $19 and $50. When my brother asked for clarification, the waiter contacted the owner's son who came over and with immediate hostility proclaimed that he wouldn't negotiate the bill with people who use coupons!¬†

Excuse me???

Suffice it to say that a situation arising from a casual, not at all uncommon, and quite reasonable inquiry about the bill became an attack on the customer before the question could even be asked. And all for purchasing \"coupons\" - the exact items Zorro's had chosen to make available at Costco, ironically assuring returning and repeat business.

Well that came to an end when the confrontation which started with the grotesquely offensive behavior of Zorro's management remarkably escalated even further. The owner eventually arrived claiming that they \"lose money when people use the coupons\" to which my brother suggested that if they don't want people using gift certificates then they shouldn't sell them!

To his credit, my brother maintained his decorum and paid the full amount of the bill despite his being well within his right to go toe to toe with the owner's son after being publicly and loudly humiliated by him in the middle of the restaurant for being one of THEM who use \"coupons.\"

Our next brothers' dinner was just a week later... at La Castile. The 20+ person function was cancelled and moved elsewhere. In un-booking these reservations, Zorro's management was completely without remorse acting with the arrogance that they don't need business from those with \"coupons.\"

All in all, Zorro's is an overpriced steakhouse with average food. It's as good a \"special occasion\" venue as any number of other places in the city. But they made it abundantly evident to us that not only do they not value customers, but they aren't beyond shaming them in public for merely buying the very gift certificates they choose to make available for sale. Any business like that simply does NOT deserve your patronage."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 1 star \"Eek! Methinks not.\" review.  Not because the food was terrible, it wasn't.  But the overall experience is one that I need not repeat.
This restaurant is located near the airport, and the minute you step in, it's like a blast into the past -- like the 1970's past, and I believe we are now living in 2014.  The decor is dark and VERY dated.  The atmosphere is heavy like L.A. smog.  The service is a little too on-point.  The second my fork was put down, someone was there to try and take away my plate.  I wouldn't mind so much, except for the fact no one else was finished with their food yet, (and neither was I).  The price point is WAAAAY off.  It is very, very, VERY expensive.  Expect a main to cost you over $30, easily.  And that's just for the main.  I had the Prime Rib, which was good and the size of my face.  Peppercorn steak was ordered, and that was prepared well, but like the room, the plating of food was not very creatively assembled.  Polite people working the restaurant, but the whole experience is not what I will ever crave for again."}
{"text":"my wife and I flew back to Pearson airport from a Mexico vacation last week and had 5 hour layover to continue on with WestJet , So we left the airport and took a taxi to nearby Zorros , I have heard good things and still needed some pampering after our all inclusive week .

IN a Positive way I felt it like a step back in time to perhaps a 1970\"s steakhouse as soon as we entered, thru the heavy Oak doors and foyer.

we were met quickly and offered seating near the real wood burning fireplace, 
walls are heavy in white aged stucco and candles on tables , mid evil  iron light fixtures, Waiters in Tuxedos , all set the stage for a very Good dinner.

we were quickly presented a tray of olives and pickles and hot basket of toasted fragrant Garlic bread . 

I had a plate of great bbq ribs, with a large baked potato
My wife had a great well done steak , Our waiter cautioned that the ribs are not that fall off the bone type at fast food beef and rib joints, Fair note, but I wonder if thought I had false teeth ?

red wine was great and our waiters were very attentive , but gave us space too.

Overall a wonderful experience in a popular vintage well attended local restaurant , From London its not a quick or easy return visit but I will always keep it in mind"}
{"text":"Massive portions of prime rib. We were only able to finish half. Also had the lamb which was good. The place is in the middle of nowhere though so pretty hard to find. The salad was very sub par - just lettuce."}
{"text":"A solid old school steakhouse. 

Very dusty and dated decor, but the table side Caesar salad ranks up with the best I've ever had. 

Chateaubriand for two with Caesar salads and red wine is our usual order, how can you go wrong"}
{"text":"I was here for a work dinner around the holidays.  It seemed very traditional/old fashioned where the waiters wore tuxs.  

The food was okay.  I ordered the prime rib which was MASSIVE.  It was good, but a bit salty.  I didn't like how the baked potato came in a small bowl - half of my potato ended up on the table.  

The dessert was good, but ice cream served on a small plate?  Kind of stupid.  

The service was a bit chaotic.  There were a lot of staff so you didn't have to wait long for anything, but it seemed like everybody was just running around like a chicken with their head cut off."}
{"text":"Great martini.  Bombay saphire, up, olives & twist.  everything else, a waste.  Have to admit I tried it because of the name and being a 3 star.  Too bad.  In the area often and won't return.  What did I not like - warm red wine, a rare steak that was cooked medium well, carrots that needed a knife to cut through and broccoli that needed a spoon.  If I did not skip breakfast and lunch I would have sent it back, but I was very hungry.  Did I tell anyone, yes.  And his response was - the steak looks fine and the carrots need to be served hard.  After a complete lack of customer service, I ate 1/3rd of the meal and asked for the bill.
What surprised me was when I sat down the host and another welcomed me and were very hospitable.  When I told the waiter I was not satisfied, he went to the host and another person, told them and they did not react.  Paid (overpaid) the bill and left.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Old school steakhouse nestled in between strip clubs.

For lunch, I recommend the steak sandwich ($14) which comes with salad and a ridiculously large order of fries.  The meat is cooked perfectly to order and is amazingly tender.

For dinner, I've come for an office gathering with the prix fixe menu.  $50 per person includes soup, salad, choice of entree (filet mignon/strip steak/salmon/scallops/ribs/prime rib), side, dessert and coffee.  The prime rib was very generously sized (must have been at least 16oz) and tender like butter.  Great deal.

The old Greek waiters are very professional and make the Caesar dressing tableside.  The relish plate with garlic bread, pickles and olives is excellent as well."}
{"text":"So I really wanted to like this place.  My wife and I entered and it has a 70's feel, probably the decor hasn't changed in 20 years (which we actually thought was cool).  All male waiters, older, distinguished, also thought this was cool.  We ordered the clam chowder, it came pretty much 1 minute after we ordered and was not mind blowing.  Almost like it came out of a can.  Then we each ordered the petit filet mignon, baked potato and house salad.  The salad came first, ice berg lettuce drenched in ranch dressing.  Not sure why they pour so much on.  We could barely eat it.  Then came the meal.  A separate little plate with a baked potato, plain.  He came with a bowl of sour cream and again, drenched the potato with sour cream.  Tons.  No chives, cheese, bacon bits.....just sour cream drenched on a plain potato.  Could barely eat it.  Then the main dish had plain steamed carrots and a huge chunk of brocolli.  No flavour or seasoning, just steamed vegetable.  The filet was pretty good, can't complain about that at all.  Cooked medium, not super flavourful but not bad, same as if I went to the Keg.  Can't say I'd go back.  I could make this meal at home for 1/4 the price and with way more flavour."}
{"text":"Wow.
Went to the Keg as I knew what to expect there first but it was way too crowded.
Took a chance on Zorro's and I couldn't have been happier that they couldn't seat us at the Keg!
Huge potions and absolutely delicious! So good.
My new favourite Steak and Seafood place in Toronto! 
Don't even bother with the Keg. 
So close to the airport too. You'll love it."}
{"text":"Friday night started our round of holiday parties for the festive season. We were invited to Zorro's Steakhouse, located by Pearson. I am discovering that this \"charming\" hood, is home to many hidden foodie havens. Hidden, well because you know why here??? Probably because many a year ago, this was not the neighborhood it has now become, aka the armpit of a bustling international airport. But I can only guess as I am still in my first decade as a transplant to T-Dot. 

Anyhu, as my gastronomical journey continues, Zorro's is definitely one of the stops to talk about. First and foremost, both the restaurant and I were born in 1975, clearly a year fraught with greatness  Secondly, it's Greek-owned, so you know flavor-overload and lots of displays of flamb√©, which is always entertaining  Thirdly, the place was buzzing! Lots of people, all age groups, and lively conversation made for a fun ambience. 

They start you off with a big basket of garlic bread and a platter of pickles and olives. Loved the olives, but the garlic bread was a bit charred and a lot salty. For anyone who knows me and my utter love for salt, you understand the magnitude of this statement. I had a couple of pieces anyway, because my lunch had consisted of an apple in anticipation of a steak dinner. However the fact is, I was able to resist a big basket of carbs. Let that sink in...

Then came the house salad with my choice of dressing: a vinaigrette. But really it was just a whole lotta vinegar on some iceberg. I found some nice crisp celery hidden in mine, but both Raff, and the gentleman to the left of me couldn't really eat theirs. The waiters did not seem to care that the salads were being returned untouched.

Now it was time for the main course. Both of us had ordered the Roast Prime Rib of Beef au Jus with baked potato from \"Our Most Requested Entr√©es\" section on the menu. Our server kept suggesting I order a small. However, I was hungry and almost felt it was presumptuous of the guy to insinuate that \"a lady should order a small.\" I insisted on a regular, whereas the hubster ordered a \"Zorro Cut\". It was only when we were served did I understand, that our server was only trying to be helpful. As you can see from the photo, the roast was enough to feed 2 or 3 people. My husband's cut was EVEN BIGGER. I could only have about a quarter before crying UNCLE. Again for those who know me, that's quite the statement. The roast was really tender and melted in the mouth, but it didn't help that it was also a bit on the salty side. I am convinced that the chef had started hitting the Ouzu a little early that evening 

For dessert I ordered the creme caramel and the hubster ordered the Tiramisu. Both were pretty good. Mine had a hint of orange rind or essence, which kept me from really enjoying it fully or finishing it. I have noticed this aftertaste in a few other places I have ordered it recently, so maybe it's the new \"thing\". Suffice it to say me no likely this innovation. Totally bid'ah! 

Final Verdict: Definitely a fun experience. Go on a night when the Chef isn't overwhelmed, so that you can ask them to hold the reigns on the salt and vinegar. And fer Gad's sake throw out your feminist agenda and order the small when the expert tells you to"}
{"text":"Okay, so this place is like going back in time. If back in time was a mob joint in Jersey with amazing food and impeccable service.

The food is great, the service makes you feel like a king, and the portions are ginormous. I mean you get salad, a main with choice of starch and veggies, a pickle tray (who does that except my Gran?!), fresh garlic bread...it's great. The caesar salad is even prepared tableside!

So keep on driving past the sketchy neighbourhood and strip joints, and enjoy a great evening at Zorro's!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT STEAK! Can't remember which steak I ordered, but I do remember that it was delicious. Think it may have been the sirloin. Would definitely recommend and visit again if I'm ever in Ontario."}
{"text":"This is what is left...
Prime rib at its best!   
Wouldn't go anyplace else for The Best Prime Rib and I'm from London area.
Caesar salad for 2, is made at table side, and excellent
Always greeted with a welcoming smile and quick to find you a table
This is Always followed with a quick service great wine table & table apps"}
{"text":"Dined here last Tuesday for a company function and it was very good.  If you enjoy old school steak houses, you will enjoy Zorro's.  Ordered the 12 oz NY Strip med rare, and it came out more so on the rare side, but I still enjoyed it.  I'm guilty of using bernaise sauce on my steaks (I know, so bad for you!), and I thought I would receive it in a small dish, but got a giant bowl of it, of which I only used a small portion.  We were served a MOUNTAIN of garlic bread, and their pickle & olive platter as table snacks.  Overall, a solid place to enjoy a good steak!"}
{"text":"This was a quick choice based on location. It was very good! This an old classic steak and seafood house. Carpet and decorations from the 70's, waiters wearing tuxedos and the busboy wearing a jacket too. Fresh garlic bread and a pickle and olive tray came to the table.....salad topped with house creamy garlic dressing was good, but the reason for only 4 stars. There was about a cup of water in the bowl when done. My meal consisted of a Filet wrapped in bacon cooked to perfection, a baked potato, steamed carrots and broccoli. The steak was a little salty, but still delish!"}
{"text":"My dad and I booked a reservation here. He's been wanting to come here for a while after hearing very good reviews about it.

We came on a Saturday night. The restaurant looked busy but not packed. The decor looked very dated. Featuring heavily textured walls, stain glass windows, extremely dim lighting, white table cloths, wide set wooden chairs with a velvety upholstery. Very old school decor leaning to the side of dated more than classy. The chair my dad sat on, the handle was falling apart.

One look at the menu and I couldn't help but think \"Holy shit. This is stupid expensive.\" Zorro's has an unusually big menu for such a high end upscale restaurant.

Oysters Rockefeller: Pretty basic and a bit watery. There was nothing special about this dish which is disappointing since 6 oysters will run you up to $20.

The complimentary salad we ordered with ranch dressing was really heavily dressed. And when I mean really heavy, I mean a soup puddle of dressing with a few bits of lettuce thrown in. We couldn't finish it because at the end, all the lettuce was soaked in a thick layer of dressing.

Rib Steak with Fries: Absolutely no seasoning. The sear was really good though but nothing special. Is it a good steak? Sure it's a good steak. Is it worth $50? No. And the fries it came with tasted like store bought McCain fries.

Mermaid Plate: Since my dad got the steak, I opted for a seafood dish and the waiter recommended this one. This featured shrimps, scallops, and crabs legs broiled in garlic butter. The cook on the scallops is pretty good. The shrimps were a bit overcooked. The crabs legs were good. This plate is a little over salted. One of the scallops wasn't washed and I bit into quite a bit of sand. After a few bites the whole plate gets redundant. Everything tastes the same and there is no relief from the salt. Not even the rice pilaf they serve it with offers relief from the saltiness because it is just as salty.

So we have one dish that is completely under salted and one dish that is completely over salted. Somewhat disappointing for such a highly reviewed restaurant. The portion sizes were huge. I couldn't even finish half of my dish.

Dessert was Tiramisu and Cappuccino were good.

Service seems a bit disjointed. Friendly, but a little all over the place. We ordered a refill on my dad's coke, it never came.

Everything here was pretty sub-par. And for price to quality I wouldn't come back here again. The price just doesn't make a lot of sense for the quality. While quantity is huge, there is only so much you can eat if the taste is mediocre."}
{"text":"Went back to dine at this place again. Once again, the portion sizes don't disappoint. They are huge cuts of steak and I feel like there was lots of food to share. 

Had the escargot and the scallops this time for appetizer. I thought the escargot wasn't that tasty even with the garlic marination added. The scallops were cooked too thoroughly so it became overcooked. But the sizes of the scallops were decent. 

The rib steak I ordered this time around was still the same size but it was seared too long on the grill. There were too much char on the surface of the steak. 

The seafood linguine was really huge too. The cream sauce was rich and there were lots of seafood. 

If there's one thing they're consistent, it's their portion sizes!! Enough to feed two ppl per dish."}
{"text":"Great steak, huge servings, excellent service- comes with a high price too. Good thing I was invited here by a supplier.
Dinner comes with complimentary bread, pickles and olives. The olives are fabulous. Their prime rib is  about 1.5 - 2 inches thick and almost covers the entire dinner plate. All entrees come with broccoli and carrots. Their desserts are wonderful as well. We had pecan pie, cheesecake , chocolate mouse."}
{"text":"Name bait! And here I thought Zorro was going to be here since I've been a long time fan!"}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto, I stopped at Zorro's late on a Saturday night (9:30 p.m.) As expected they were out of Prime Rib, so I ordered the Rib Steak. It was seared a little past my liking but had good flavor and was big. The vegetables, broccoli with a cheddar sauce, were large to the point where I had to cut them 2 or 3 times to make them edible. They were somewhat cold. Wine selection was just OK. I liked the environment - an old supper club or hunt club-type feel. The wait staff was very professional and attentive. I thought the food was a bit overpriced, and I'm giving consideration to that fact that I was there at the end of the night after the regular dinner rush.

I would recommend Zorro's for steaks- just get there earlier than I did..."}
