{"text":"Flicka's is amazing!!! Flicka's couldn't have been a better setting for my 10 year high school reunion. Flicka helped with getting us all set up from food to drinks. I received so many compliments of the location, the setting, and the food. The food was perfect and all the guys were happy that they could go back for more. And of course our bartenders and waitresses were awesome! Thank you for making it a memorable night!"}
{"text":"We went on a Monday and enjoyed The Long Island Ice Teas and Cheeseburger Special. Then back on Friday for $2.50 Coronas and free buffet at 6:30.   Great service, great prices, great food. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I love Flicka's Bar and Grill. This restaurant has the best fajitas, rice, and beans. I always get chicken and steak mixed instead of just picking one meat for the fajitas. I have also had the cheese burgers and they are awesome too. Flicka's always has eat for free on Fridays as well which I just found out. You just have to make a donation of some monies and you can eat off the buffet! Flicka the owner is always doing fund raisers to help those in need out. I think this bar is top notch and the service is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst service you can imagine !!!they are way understaffed it took an hour to get a drink I highly recommend you give much thought before coming here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food and the atmosphere is amazing and laid back. I wish more owners were like Flicka. He made sure we had an amazing time. Nicole was our bar tender and she made some mean drinks. All in all, an amazing place worth visiting and making into a usual haunt."}
{"text":"Its a cute bar. Its was super busy when I went so that was probably the reason for the long wait for drinks. I did like the band that was playing though. Other than that, thats all I remember besides the worst thing about the bar was the bathroom smell....OMG...it stunk like straight sewer! I would give this place another chance but if I went back and the bathroom still smelled I think I would probably not come back."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos on Tuesday & Thursday .best in town and the best thing they're only $1.00.the service is great , will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant!  Great value here.  The taste of the food has never disappointed.  You should visit this place."}
{"text":"My go to bar in south scottsdale! The people that work here make this place special. My first visit, almost a year ago, the manager Adam made us feel right at home and even provided some drinks on the house. Being a poor college student at the time, I thought this was the greatest thing since Ramen noodles.   Then we meet Flicka! The owner of this bar is the nicest most interesting person I have ever meet. Anyone that goes to Flickas on a regular basis knows Flicka. He is always a great host to us and he makes this place more than just another bar in Scottsdale.  With the projectors and multiply TVs this is a great place to catch a game and the food is amazing. The dollar tacos on Tuesdays and Thursdays are unbelievable, but my go to meal are the chicken fajitas!! Oh man they are delicious."}
{"text":"(Its really 2 and a half stars) We went here because my friend's friend is a bartender or server or something. It was kinda cold, and honestly if your going to have the whole place open you'd think you'd add some heaters somewhere. I haven't eaten the food because we got there when the kitchen was closed. The margaritas I really didn't like. I drink a lot of margaritas and when you do that you can tell whats a good one and whats a super sour pre mixed margarita. You'd think with only a hundred or so miles to Mexico someone would know how to make a good margarita, but no. The DJ was pretty good. People were dancing whether they'll remember it or not, and as the night went on the music became more radio popular and less oldies and goodies. They have two pool tables in a corner, which can be nice, but you'll probably have a hard time getting on them, I only saw one go free for about 15 minutes and we were there for a couple hours. I'd probably go back here if this was the kind of random atmosphere I was looking for, but I'm not sure if i want to classify this as \"Random American Bar w/ Mexican Food\" or what..."}
{"text":"Food was decent but service was awful and not worth the long wait and unfriendly/snappy waitress."}
{"text":"The only thing to say about Flickas is,\" Why in the heck can't you pass a health inspection...EVER\". You can't even get hand washing right"}
{"text":"Absolutely miss this place since I've moved out of state.  Flicka's is the best.  Great food, great prices.  You guys ROCK."}
{"text":"note: I was at an event here, so I can't speak to their typical service.  what I can say, though, is that our group had a BLAST. we're large (something like 300 people) and we're famously rowdy, but the whole staff here was nothing but patient and welcoming with us.   the only reason it's not 5 is because i feel like i save 5 stars for businesses i know better or am super wow'd by. I'd have to go back here for dinner or just drinks with friends to know for sure. but what I can say is that they've hosted parties for us regularly and they are always very accommodating."}
{"text":"This place is just sad. It was dead despite having a live band playing. The band was horrible too. The food was disgusting and I was sick for two days after. The bartender, if that's what you want to call her, was so rude. She was on her phone the whole time and only helped out what seemed to be her friends. I'm just waiting for this place to be on an episode of bar rescue."}
{"text":"I was walking with a bunch of friends when we decided to stop in. The place was alive with music and the bartenders were great. I got to meet the owner and dance with a great group of people. To slow down and eat, they have a great outdoor patio to enjoy the night. Next time I'm in town, I am definitely stopping back."}
{"text":"Ok, so we're not from Scottsdale and my husband said this place had good reviews. I walked in and was a bit frightened by the dive-y feel, dingy and eclectic decorations. But to my skepticism, we were greeted by a very friendly/personable yet super busy waitress. The food was delicious, the drinks were not outrageously priced (and decent- we had margaritas that were pretty run of the mill). We met Flicka, the owner, and I'm glad we did. He's fantastic and welcoming to everyone that walks into the door. I also watched him take out the trash and clean up the bar, so he's really involved and gets down and dirty too (which is respectable in a restaurant owner!). If we're ever back in the Scottsdale we will definitely come back to Flicka's."}
{"text":"OK, I've only been once. The GF and I were in search of a happy hour in the area.  Flicka's was a huge disappointment!!! They didn't have any food specials on the day we went, and the drink specials were limited to domestic beers. Ugh! Maybe it's livelier at night, but our afternoon experience was bad. The food was bland bar food, and the nachos had already started to cool and congeal by the time they arrived at our table. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"Celebrated our friend's 50th!  Accomodated all of us (30 people I think), great customer service, music on point to keep you dancing all  night.  love love love."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service! The owner Flicka is very down to earth and treated us just like family. Highly recommend Flicka's!!"}
{"text":"Unsuspecting and awesome!  Always a great stop! Wings and Fajitas are amazing, and the staff (Maryanne & Erin especially) are always fun! Great salt water aquarium too... beautiful."}
{"text":"Well it was 4 years later and I decided to grab a drink and some food here after a few other places in the area had no seats available. Flicka's will always have a seat available and it turns out they also have some good food and specials. They have $1 barbacoa tacos every Tuesday and Thursday, but I opted for the $9 Fajita chicken sandwich. This sandwich has chicken, peppers and onions with a layer of cheese on top in a very soft roll. The onion rings were decent quality too. They still have that owner who is always there (Flicka perhaps) and a good amount of TV sets and the always empty giant patio. Mostly locals and regular's here, but nothing wrong with with that scenario and I will return more often now. Tacos are calling."}
{"text":"Ok place. Has really gone down hill. Service is average. When and if it is busy, the waitresses aren't always attentive. Most if the time it is slow. The food is good."}
{"text":"We went to Flickas after a baseball game the owner was very friendly and he gave us a great deal on lunch for about twenty guys. Which included beer and shots as well. It's not kid friendly but during the day it was okay because we had the place to ourselves. The food was good for the price and the great personalized service it can't be beat."}
{"text":"This place was horrible, even with fun friends! It is like a bar out of Mexico. I did not like it. They do have a live band inside and patio tables & benches...other than that....it sucks."}
{"text":"Super great prices. Good atmosphere. And the food is absolutely a-stinking-mazing! Thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"Always a fun place for partys wedding receptions or watch sports with a bucket of cold ones and some friends there is always smiling friendly people indoors or on the big outdoor patio in the shade. And of course theres Flicka!! Cheers/Salud my  friends."}
{"text":"Third time back here service was horrible. .waitresses never checked if everything was ok they acted like they would rather be somewhere else.  Food is horrible again the only good thing about this place is the vacation type atmosphere"}
{"text":"I went here on a week day with my boyfriend because it's usually packed when we drive by, plus the reviews are pretty good.  When we got there, it was pretty empty. There were 3 other tables that had people. The staff was nowhere to be found. We waited a few minutes, and then a guy (I think the owner) ran by us to chat with one of the tables. No hello or we'll be with you in a minute. Finally a woman came by and started cleaning. I asked if they were still open, and she said yes, so she had us sit and got our orders. She seemed nice, but the service turned out to be SLOW.  I ordered the Chili Dog and lemonade.. you can't go wrong with that, it's nearly impossible to screw up. My boyfriend ordered the fish tacos and a beer. It is weird that they said they only serve bottles, a little off-putting. The lemonade was kind of gross, it tasted like it was made from a powder. The fries that came with the chili dog were alright, but I don't think there's a way to make fries taste bad. The chili dog was bland. I ate it all because I was starving, but the chili tasted weird. I thought I was the only one who had a bad experience, because while we were eating, I asked my BF if he liked the food and he didn't respond. When we left though he said it was bad. It took forever to get our check too.  Maybe we were there on an off day/time, but I won't be returning. I thought about leaving when nobody greeted us, but I stupidly stayed, thinking that it'd be at least as good as the other Baja restaurant we go to, only closer."}
{"text":"Flicka's is the place to go if you are trying to ball on a budget. The drinks are cheap!  The service is pretty good, but if Flicka is there and you talk to him he will be sure you have a good time. Flicka is a fun bar owner and makes you wish more industry business owners were more personable.   The food is surprisingly good but it is bar food so don't go here looking for a trendy menu.    It's a little dark for my preference to watch a game, but if you like darker lighting places then you will enjoy this place."}
{"text":"If you've never eaten here, no words. Go!! Me and my dad Napo's favorite spot. The food comes out super fast, ridiculously cheap for the services and food your getting. If it wasn't so far from me I'd go at least once a week. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and atmosphere! There's live music on Saturdays, and some Thursdays; all the bands are fantastic. Nicole and Bella are amazing bartenders, along with the owner, Flicka! Love this place"}
{"text":"I visited this place with a large group of friends Friday night. It was a lot of fun. The only thing I didn't like was we had tickets for free drinks but they were only accepted at one of the bars and when we got there there wasn't anyone working it. I gave up waiting and bought a drink at the other bar."}
{"text":"This place has amazing wings.  They are all drumsticks, and they are amazing.  2 dozen huge meaty wings  for $11 bucks??? ( It's in house only fyi.)  That's how much most places charge for 1 doz.  And the people here are really really friendly.  We brought our furry kid and sat on the patio.   Nicole, our waitress,  brought our pup water and was very quick with service, even though we were the only ones on the patio.  When I went inside, I noticed that she was also the bartender.  Pretty impressed that she was so quick with everything.   This is our second time here...and we will be back.  I just love being able to bring our dog with us when it's nice outside.   And even better when the staff is cool with the mutt."}
{"text":"This business has been around for a long time, and if you didn't already know this...you can tell just by looking at the building (interior and exterior).  Really in need of some renovation and tlc.  The staff is very nice, the service is good.  If you need a place to relax and have a beer with a friend it's a decent place."}
{"text":"Friendly servers and bartenders , billar pool, Dj , stage for bands , tasty food . Tvs all around to watch your favorite game , outside patio , what else can you ask for ? Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"This place is sort of a dive bar meets a decent cantina. This place offers great values. The liquor and food is priced reasonably. The Mexican food was decent and better than I expected based on the décor and menu display.   The service was great but the waitresses were so attentive that it was almost a negative thing. Many patrons could view this as being pushy."}
{"text":"Nice size outdoor patio - an outdoor patio is essential for a AZ bar. I saw some heat lamps out there too so it can be used year round. Went there on a Saturday night and they had a DJ who played a huge mix of music from 70's and 80's to today's top 40. They have a stage in the back too so I assume they have bands too... during my visit this became a dance floor. Had my dinner at this place to as part of a buffet (not sure they offer this all the time; we had a large group) but I enjoyed the food offered to us."}
{"text":"Went in for wing Wednesday and unfortunately had to leave due to not ever being greeted or acknowledged the 25 minutes we were in there. The bartender never said anything to us despite greeting other tables near us although they seemed annoyed and to have been waiting a while as well. The full blame can't be put on the bartender though considering she did have a full bar and we were one of ten tables and she seemed to be working alone other than what appeared to be a manager occasionally walking around, but still not acknowledging us or really anyone. Over all as my first experience I can't say that I'll be back. If you're going to understaff your restaurant at least help out the employee."}
{"text":"This is a fun bar. The owner is a gem. With the right band it's a great place to dance."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience at Flicka's recently and I wanted to share.   Flicka's is a great place if you are looking for an awesome patio that has room for groups of people and food and drinks at reasonable prices.  You can chill out, play bean bag toss, it's quiet enough to chat with your friends, but busy enough to keep you entertained.  You almost forget you are in Scottsdale!  :-)   (for you locals, that's a good thing --- remember, this is the CenPho girl speaking here...haha)     A bucket of 6 beers was less than $20.  Rock on!    The food was really good, I was seriously impressed with the taste.   It's what you would expect at a bar/cantina, true - but you don't have to be 5 beers in to enjoy it!   We had a cheese crisp that was indeed cheesy and crispy.  Also shared a chicken quesadilla, which exceeded my expectations.  The nachos were tasty.  The salsa was delicious too, which is not to be underrated as good salsa is sometimes hard to come by at bars.  The best part of it all though?   The owner, Flicka himself, came over and said hello, told us awesome stories about his time in Mexico, asked us about the service, and even told us that we were missing out on the best food there - the barbacoa tacos, so he sent an order over to us.   He was right - the barbacoa tacos were delicious!  He also educated us on tequila.  (and that's a story for another day... haha)  It's a great meeting point between Scottsdale and Tempe and it's totally worth it!! All in all, a great experience at Flicka's!   I hope more people go check this place out."}
{"text":"I do t yet gave a review, but, Paiute is having an all school reunion there on the 3rd of April. We are driving into town from The SF Vat area after a 37 year abscesses. I will have a small dog that I can't heave at the hotel (their policy). Can I bring her to the reunion with her in a stroller?"}
{"text":"My wife and I go to Flicka's often for the Coronado High School monthly reunions. We always have a good time with friends, drinks and plenty of food."}
{"text":"After waiting an hour and calling three cab companies we were fianlly able to get to the bar.   Flicka's is pretty spacious. They have inside seating and an outdoor patio with heat lamps. I went on A Saturday around 6p. so not too many people were there. The services was scare and it was very slow to get our food. The prices are NICE! I got a dozen wings, two beers, and a side of french fries for seventeen dollars.  The wings were good: hot spicy, and saucy with just the right amount of meat.  If I ever wind up back in Scottsdale, I'll head back here."}
{"text":"This is not your upscale bar in Scottsdale, which is why I like it a lot (that and the $2 Coronas...).  The food is serviceable and not expensive, the people are real and down to earth for the most part.  Because of it's location you do get quite a mix of people.  It can get pretty crowded in the evenings.  They have a great outdoor seating area, and if you're in to sports, several large screen tv's.  I love it as a place to meet people..."}
{"text":"Flickas is great, we get the softball team to head over after games on tuesdays to eat up some of those shrimp tacos that are so damn good. Everybody is really nice that works there, talkative; $2 Coronas are good and cold and there's always something good on the TV's if you want to watch sports. Chips and salsa are super good too.   I like it cause it's not a typical snobby scottsdale place and the mix of people and ages are pretty diverse.  You've gotta love the salt water aquariums too.   Anyways - check it out - good stuff.  And if you see the crazy guy with shoulder length hair - that's Flicka - he's super talkative and a really nice guy - say Hi! They have a site but it needs some web developer love from me:  http://flickasbajacantina.com/"}
{"text":"A large fun dive bar with a great patio. They took out the great horseshoe bar to put in a stage for the bands. They also did away with the draft beer. Prices are very reasonable.  Food very average Sometimes large groups of people will come in here. They have adequate TVs but not a true sports bar. Plenty of parking in back. This is a friendly ,fun neighborhood bar. Casual dress. Although not a pick up bar you can meet singles in here"}
{"text":"I hate bringing down a once 4 star review to one star, but it had to be done. If we ever go back, I'll see if it still stays the same.  I went back a couple of weeks ago with my metal arts friends...and I have to say what a difference it was. Literally night and day.  Our server was surly and pissy...the food was just appallingly bad...Flicka was nowhere to be found. Service was slow and it wasn't even busy. A whole...4 tables including ours?  The only remotely good thing about that night, though it's still NOT enough to make me give Flicka's 2 stars, is the checks were all split and correctly done.  Maybe the employees decided to take a break since the owner wasn't there? Whatever it was, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are mediocre at most but service is really good. These girls are working pretty hard."}
{"text":"What a find!! Everything from a local bar where you can just hang out -to a fun hang out with great music and great outdoor patio with great food-Great tacos at a great price on Tuesday. But best of all Nicole who runs the show by herself!! Always a laugh and a quick comeback!! Great things come in small packages that's Nicole!!  Thanks to my brother I found a great neighborhood place to go for a bite to eat and a cold drink or two!!"}
{"text":"We went here a few Sundays ago to catch a football game and grab some food and a few beers.  It was fairly empty, I'm guessing less than 20 people, yet the volume for the game was so loud, we could barely talk at our table.  We sat in a booth far from the bar crowd, server after server walked towards an area near us, but ignored us.  One of the guys went to the bar, got a menu and asked for a server.  There was a table of 3 behind us, and one said, don't bother, the food isn't good.  After 15 minutes, without one person approaching us, we left and will never return.  It seemed kinda dirty too."}
{"text":"$1 beef tacos on Tuesday got my vote.  They are getting strict with the drinks requiring a 1 drink minimum. Not a big fan of that considering my boyfriend and I always order 5 tacos each and chips and salsa.  We love the bubbly waitress with the brown hair who always makes us feel welcome and like she's known us for 50 years (even though she's only 20 something).  Flicka is friendly too."}
{"text":"Didn't have big expectations but was pleasantly surprised. We were looking for a quick lunch before a spring training game.  Our server/ bartender recommended the shrimp tacos and they did not disappoint. Flicka himself brought us our food, introduced himself and chatted with us a bit. Looks like it would be a fun night time spot."}
{"text":"We had a happy hour event on the spacious, airy patio last night at Flicka's. Great turn out, perfect weather, good company, good service, great night!  I forgot all about the free \"Friday happy hour\" buffet indoors and ordered the spinach and shrimp salad. I was was pleasantly surprised by the price of the salad, which was MUCH more reasonable than other restaurants I have been too lately ($5 for a small bowl of shoestring fries at that other place?!) The shrimp was grilled and good! I had enough leftover for a late night snack. That's what I'm talking about!  I just read a previous review about the horrible sewer ladies bathroom smell. Yup...still there. The toilet had clogged (if that happens all the time, why not install industrial toilets?!...duh) and water was all over the floor. There was a Hawaiian air freshener (the same one I have in my bathroom at the moment) in there that smelled awful mixed with foul sewer smell. I know I can never buy THAT air freshener again.  Flicka's- you would have had a five star rating without the sewer-smelling, wet floor bathroom, with the bathroom door propped open while I used the toilet....but thanks for the offer to use the employee bathroom.  Has Captain Morgan flown the coop? I didn't see him inside on bathroom runs."}
{"text":"Great price on a bucket of Corona's.....other than that there is no reason to come here. This place is a dump!  The bathrooms were disgusting and OUR waitress was not the sharpest tool in the shed.  She could barely get an order straight so we finally had to go inside to order our drinks.   The patio is here is spacious but it's right on top of Scottsdale Rd. so it's busy and loud with all the traffic.  I didn't read if they had food but OMG...I can only imagine.  This place was filthy all around.  Not a fan..."}
{"text":"Back in the Scottsdale area again. Time to get into some new places and see what they are all about. I did not go to this place YELP guided. This was the recommendation of the manager of the baseball team, 1st mistake. Supposedly close to where we were staying, 2nd mistake to listen to anything directional or distance related from this guy.   For starters this place is a retro style bar with a patio out front, including some great sofa lounge areas, and a wide open interior with dark mood lighting and sporadic TVs. There is a bar, but no beer is on tap. This was a non-issue for me, but apparently the guys would have preferred tap.  We were immediately greeted by the owner of the bar who apparently recognized the guys as a team or group of some sort. He was thrilled to have us all there and offered to have some appetizers and fajitas brought out for everyone (after we had all already ordered, but a very sweet and generous gesture.) He was very friendly and checked up on us several times. ( 5 star for sure)  Our server was very friendly, very efficient with filling everyone's drinks, and continually making sure that we were happy. The waters, cokes, and iced teas were never low and it never required asking for to get something we wanted or needed. (5 stars)  The appetizers, buffalo wings, were a bit over cooked or maybe just older than they should have been. The buffalo sauce was good, only mild to moderate in spice. The fajitas we were given were just OK. The veggie portion of them was fresh and excellent, but the chicken was only OK. The tortillas seemed just a bit less than fresh, though brought to us warm. The salsa, a flop! Extremely mild and almost just tomato sauce. A waste of energy for sure. My buffalo chicken sandwich started off good. The chicken seemed about right and the buffalo sauce was good, then I found myself trying to chew a gristle. Yes, you get those sometimes, and I can usually deal with them.... but with the lights down so dark, I could not work my way around it. Ugh. The salad with vinaigrette was good and fresh, but it was just romaine lettuce and tomatoes. (a 3 star)  Just before we were going to leave, a blues band began to perform. The lead singer, a young twently something girl, was actually quite good. I was rather impressed and they seemed to keep the attention of the restaurant patrons. (a 5)  But, the bathroom. Ick. There was water (I hope) all over the floor, there was a twenty something vomiting in a stall, and it just seemed filthy. (a 2 star)  So, my overall rating, though we were so appreciative of the good treatment, still has to be 3 stars. I probably would not go back here, even if the owner offered me more free food. To me, the service is above and beyond the food, but it does not compensate for not so good food.   Caveat, this might be an excellent place for just the bar scene and watching the band! But, don't rely on the food."}
{"text":"This is a FUN place. Great drinks (red headed slut shot)!!! whooooo hoooooooo. The guac is great, the hot wings are yummy. It is a great place to sit outside (under the misters) and hang with work people and friends."}
{"text":"Holy crap the food is amazing! Get some wings or tacos. They are actually real wings not tiny lil chicken scraps. Taco Tuesdays are the bomb, oh Lord the barbacoa is freak'n nutz!!!"}
{"text":"Some times a good thing is right under your nose and you just don't see it.  I have lived within a mile of this place for 25 years. Longer then Flicka's itself, when the cavernous space housed The Pink Pepper Thai food.  I think I have had about a half dozen stops into Flicka's in the two and a half decades and since then 3 visits in the last month.  My brother likes the place a lot , he even introduced me to The infamous Flicka himself. I was impressed to have the owner present, even more to see him run food, tend bar, clear tables, and cross palms with so many of the regulars. His easy going personal style is pretty darn impressive.  Why is Flicka's almost always on the slow side?, first its huge! Massive patio and giant great room can easily swallow 30 or 40 people, but with such a great space in the Exploding neighborhood of South Scottsdale, it should be elbow to elbow.  Service has always been great, kind, fast, and efficient, I'm not a regular yet, so I imagine its only going to get better.  There are great specials every day and I am still trying to figure out what's what, but I do like Wed's to play poker and scarf some of the best wings in town for what I imagine is cost, (40 cents each)I think there is a taco night, and other specials but you really have to ask. No website, No social media to be found anywhere.  As far as the food in this Baja Cantina, it runs the gamut from Bar/Food to great Bar/Mex specialties  including shrimp cocktails and Sizzling Fajitas, All excellent and well priced (SUPER CHEAP)  This place is super laid back, has an awesome patio, Great service, awesome food, and gallons and gallons of booze!  It is worth the stop, and my new favorite spot in the hood."}
{"text":"On sat night you don't get refills last time I was here I remember having to hunt the waitress down for a refill. I should have known when the drink came in a smaller size. What makes me angry is the waitress not telling me I was being charged. Then I ordered the shrimp tacos ala cart because I didn't want rice and beans to my surprise when you order less food it costs three dollars more so be sure to get the plate and waste the rice and beans. I always worry this place will go out of business. It's such a cool dive bar with slow service and  they typical you should expect. Just sucks I have to leave one of south Scottsdale classic spots one star"}
{"text":"Went here Sunday for lunch with my boyfriend.  As always, I had a good time.   When I think of Flicka's I think cool chill laid back place to grab a corona.  They only have bottled beers and I believe a full bar.  Everything I've eaten here has been quite tasty, nothing too special, but also not a breaded food coma either.  I've been on live music nights as well and always have fun, I admit it is such a mixed crowd, but I don't mind, as long as I'm not paying a cover charge to wonder around aimlessly because I can't find a seat or a spot on the dance floor.  I wish Chuck Powell and the edge 103.9 would be holding the Fantasy Football Texas Hold'em for Monday nights, that was always my favorite!    Anyway back to my most recent trip.  The bar was pretty much empty.  There was a table of say 20 people celebrating a birthday or something, and I'm sure that they were regulars because it seemed as if they knew the bartender fairly well.  I'm pretty sure she was the only one serving too.  She was pretty good at keeping the beers full and in front of us.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail to start to fill out our appetites.  It was pretty good and we left thinking we had to try and make this on our own.  After letting that settle we decided to split the fajita sandwhich.  I'm so glad we did, it was so good.  As we were sitting at the bar, we noticed a bottle of Seagrams Sweet Tea Vodka.  What in the world???  I didn't know Seagrams had vodka.  We asked the bartender what it was and she stated the obvious but also asked us if we wanted to taste it.  I thought that was pretty cool!"}
{"text":"First, let me start by saying I have been going here for a long time with a friend of mine.  We have been meeting here about once a week for years, and it's not because it's amazing, but because the drinks are cheap, the food has been decent, and it's quiet.  The service has never been great here, but today was especially bad.  The server never came over to the table after 20 minutes, so we went up to the bar to get food menus and a drink.  She was so distracted with talking across the bar, after asking us what we wanted, that she didn't pour our drinks for another 10 minutes.  It wasn't like the place was busy, either...It was 2/3 empty.  Then, when we get our menus from her and sit down to order, she again never came by to get our orders, so my friend went to the bar to order our food.  When we finally got it, the food looked good, but my chicken fajitas smelled like someone had dumped Windex over them.  It had a very \"off\" smell.  I decided to try it anyway, but it tasted even weirder.  I thought maybe it was me, but my friend smelled them and tried them too, and she was also worried that I would get sick if I ate them.  I hate sending food back, but when some other server finally checked on us, I politely told her I didn't fell like I could eat them, and she looked annoyed with me, but she took them back.  We asked for a check, and it never came...so eventually we had to walk back up to the bar to ask for it.  At one point, the owner even yelled across the bar for the server to check on us, and it didn't happen.  All in all, it was disappointing, and we're going to be finding a new weekly spot where they care about the place and the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Baja Cantina Restaurant. It reminds me of the movie Roadhouse with Patrick Swazey.  After Swazey cleaned it up and made it friendly, like Cheers. The food is priced right, with generous portions. The all girl staff are friendly and attractive. Live music on weekends. Huge TV's. Pool tables. Outdoor huge patio. Fun and mellow. Highly recommend. :-)"}
{"text":"\"Before both of my feet fully entered Flicka's, I knew I had already contracted the Swine Flu..\" Thanks to Georgie S, I now know why I have a sore throat, cough and achy body. Thanks Flicka's for giving me Swine Flu.   This place is really disorganized, the wait staff (the bartenders the waitresses the bussers) are all really snotty and were all rude, not to mention slow as the second coming.   The nicest person in that bar was the little Mexican flower guy who fell in love with me and gave me a pair of roses, free of charge.   The one good thing about this bar was the cheap beers. My Corona was $2.50 and the Bud Lights were $2.   The outdoor patio is cool, but it is filled with all the smokers so unless you want to catch lung cancer, it is smart to just stay inside.   My friends band played (I have seen them play at least a dozen times in a variety of venues) and the sound was so horrible. You couldn't hear vocals at all.   In between the 5 rock bands that played, they piped R&B music over the speakers. I thought this was a little strange.... and I also found the massive dance orgy that busted out to be a little strange.  Some dude sent his wing-woman over to the bar while I was getting drinks to try and get me to join their table. She was the oldest looking wing-woman I have ever seen. It made me immediately want to cancel my tanning membership.   What a really weird group of people here. Seriously.   I didn't really care for the food. I consider myself a nachos connoisseur now that I date Dallas G, and these nachos were sub-par.   I highly doubt I will ever be back to this weird ass place!"}
{"text":"I recommend the chip, salsa and guacamole to start!!! The salsa is homemade and amazing!!! Next up the Hot chicken wings which were perfect:) Honestly... They were better than Natives chicken wings!! Chicken quesadilla is a must too!!! Shrimp tacos are delicious as well with the rice and beans Kids got the chicken tenders! They are pretty picky when it comes to them, but they loved them and had the coating every kid loves!!!! Eating at Flickas is a must!!! Stop by for lunch or dinner if you are in the area:)"}
{"text":"Impromptu visit.  saw the patio & lights from the street & decided to stop in.  a little rough around the edges... but if you can get over that you'll have a great time.   the Saturday night band was pretty damn good with a great selection of Latin music. the girl who did the Selena songs was also awesome.   drinks were cheap & the girl bartender was doing an excellent job at getting to everyone. they didn't have a super stocked bar [don julio nor red stripe] but we substituted & those selections did the trick. :)   overall my gf's & I had a great time & got our cardio in on the dance floor."}
{"text":"This place has an odd crowd. I've enjoyed their salads and chips and salsa, but haven't had much else. Their drinks are reasonable and the place is pretty nice inside. They improved the outside as well. So what's the problem? The music, man... if it's not your thing, you won't like it. The place is a little too country for me. I feel like someone's gonna bust out line dancing at any moment. They'll occasionally do a karaoke night with a live band as backup which can be kinda fun if you like that sort of thing.  Flicka's gets kinda busy at times and other times it's empty when it should be packed. It's strange. Considering the location, the crowd should be a lot more fun than it is Since it's next to Babe's, there's often dancers there grabbing a meal - aside from that though, the place is a little too country and I'm a little too rock and roll. It's a decent joint, but not my cup o tea. Worth checking out, but it's not on my list of places I want to go."}
{"text":"Flicka's was quiet, not many people. Flicka was there interacting with guests which was great. Coronas are always 2.50 which was great. Fridays you get a free buffet dinner with the purchase of 2 drinks...we bought two cheap Coronas and got a plate of decent food. It was a steal for sure.   The salsa here is awesome, I loved it! Too bad it wasn't free chips and salsa. The food wasn't bad, it wasn't anything super awesome. Pretty basic. I would come again on some random Friday. The atmosphere was  chill and the patio was enjoyable."}
{"text":"The best hidden gem in south Scottsdale! My friends and I came in on a Wednesday night and were so glad we did. Our waitress, Danielle, was so welcoming and fun! The owner, Flicka stopped by and talked with us and welcomed us. Definitely a great local gem with a stellar staff and owner! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I went to Flicka's to see a friend's band play.  There was one server who only appeared to be clearing away empty glasses and plates.  I never saw her taking a drink order.  I went to the bar where there were two very over worked bartenders.  I asked for a drink and was told they don't carry that brand of gin.  I then asked for a Kiltlifter beer...again, they don't carry that beer.  Was finally able to get a beer that I liked and went back to our table.   Shortly after, the \"bouncer\" said he had a party of 50 or 60 people coming in and he would have to take our table... Overall, I did not think that Flicka's had anything to recommend it."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out on the weekends and watch a band, which is exactly what we did last Friday - Past experience tells me to stay away during the week.  The food was pretty good, service was reasonable. The atmosphere reminds me of Dos Gringos, though the crowd was older and it's a little cleaner.  They have two bars (one inside and one out), and a huge outdoor patio area that would be great when summer is over."}
{"text":"i was here last June, was starving and craving meat, Flicka's carries excellent quality meat, the problem is they incinerate it, i ordered a  skirt steak rare, and a burger medium rare, to go. , i got home, the skirt steak turned out to be a 11.8th inch over well done ribeye, greasy as hell, the burger was impossible to choke down, i had called Flicka back immediately, he said he would replace the items, i gave him my name, said i would be in soon, well he nevr took down my name, cause when i went back, and asked for my food, they were puzzled,, i came back 3 times never saw flicka again, and its a shame, because ive had  a very very good burger there before, i guess he doesnt  care about keeping business. plenty of food for the money but if its inedible its not worth a cent, by the way, i was starting to heal from a bad accident a humerus break,, this was after 7 mo, and last time i triedd to get my food, an underaged young over intoxicated patron, came up behind me on the patio, shook my shoulders and rebroke my arm, almost a year later because of this i lost all use of my arm... 1st time i went i would have given this place a 4 star for its erasonable prices, tho i;ve only tried the burger great value comes with either nachos, fries or a very nice salad, but now , if i could  i would not put any start at all since this isnt an option, i give it 1, start flicka just doesnt give a damn and i was totally ripped off,also, dont evn think of using the restrooms here filthy"}
{"text":"It's just Flickas. It's a South Scottsdale staple and dive bar. It's the consumate 3 star bar."}
{"text":"When I feel like living on the edge. You know, doing something dicey. Entering a neighborhood you wouldn't normally dare to cross. I go to South Scottsdale. Ooooo....yea, that's right. Not North. Not Oldtown. But that seedy stretch called SoSco. And when I'm there Flicka's is pretty dang fun. Kind of a weird sports, meets ASU, meets the gays (oh, well when I'm there with my gang anyway) crowd. Music is loud. Dance floor gets jammin. Lots of hip hop. And lots of hip hop moves. And then there's me. Yes. Me. Doing the running man. I can't help myself. What? The sprinkler. Sure, why not. They have buckets of Coronas and really great chicken taquitos. Servers are usually the hottie chick types but always really friendly and efficient. I like hanging out on their huge patio and watching the Scottsdale Road action. So if you want to have a good time in SoSco, I say, picka a Flicka's!"}
{"text":"Great place. The owner (Flicka) is awesome! Food is outstanding and drinks are reasonable priced for Scottsdale. I will be coming here all the time."}
{"text":"Fliccas bar is a fun place to go. They  have live band and/or a  DJ playing all kinds of good tunes all night long. Great buffet during happy hour(On Fridays) and a great menu of good baja/Mexican food. The drinks are a good price too!!! Pool tables  and an out side patio that will blow you away. There is a lot of fun people;lots of good-looking females :) ...and they're friendly too. So I give it 5 STARS for sure.   Flickas!!!"}
{"text":"Flicka's is Outstanding.  A very down home, comfortable place to enjoy good food, good drinks and Great company.  The owner, Flicka, is one of the nicest guys and is very accommodating.  Forget all those other trendy Scottsdale places, go to Flick's any relax and enjoy yourself!  Flicka, you're the best and a Big Thank You for everything.  We'll definitely be back the next time we're in town.  (I got you Babe)"}
{"text":"It's a place.  They have cheap drinks (a lot of the time).  They have food (some times).  And there's a commotion there (all the time).  Get it in, people."}
{"text":"I've only been to Flicka's a few times because it's quite a drive for me, but I wish it was closer because I would definitely be there every Taco Tuesday. Absolutely the best 99 cent, marinated Barbacoa tacos you will find anywhere around. Stopped in this past Tuesday to meet some friends, and our bartender/server Trish, was super friendly and prompt with our orders and the tacos once again did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place. I was here with a very large group and they did their best to keep up with us. They were plentiful with the drinks and the music was really good. We were dancing on tables and the stage. Very little was off limits. Except, the food they served us was sub par (which is to be expected from a bar) but I expect more diversity then pasta done 3 different ways."}
{"text":"Attended a going away party on the patio. Apparently there was some event going on in the bar that was much more important than anything on the patio. Or decent food.  The dog-friendly patio (a plus) has a very uneven floor which makes the stools wobbly (a minus and a safety hazard).  They might have had 3 servers on duty (I know they had 2 and I think I saw a third) who were absolutely overwhelmed with the crowd. There were 2 servers who occasionally made their way to the patio. My wife went into the bar to secure a couple of menus since no one could be bothered to bring one out to us. The waitress later came by, not to take our orders, but to ask if we were done with the menus since they ran out and needed some inside for people who were apparently more important than us. We handed over the menus which were falling apart and put in our orders which the waitress seemed surprised we were ready to put in (yeah, we were done with the crappy menus because we were ready to order -- does that not make sense?). She also got the order wrong.  The drink my wife ordered was watered down. Service was slow and inaccurate. First order that came out wasn't ours which confused the waitress -- second was ours, but was wrong and we couldn't hold the server's attention long enough to get that message across.  The food was nearly inedible. The steak tacos were passable, though I've had better from Del Taco. The steak was poorly seasoned and dry. As for the beans and rice, the beans were undercooked, the rice was overcooked, the cheese had the consistency of plastic, and all the food was cold.  My wife's \"Macho Nachos\" were completely inedible. Steak once again was dried out, they ran out of guacamole (seriously, a Mexican themed restaurant runs out of guac at 8pm on a Saturday?), and -- are you ready? -- the tortilla chips were burnt. I'm not even kidding. They were charred around the edges.  When the waitress, who never returned to see how we were doing or find out if we wanted more drinks, finally came by to settle up (after I went into the bar and got cashed out by the bartender since we didn't see our waitress for nearly an hour), she did, after standing there in shock for a few seconds, offer to try to do something to make things right. We'd already paid and we certainly had no intention of trying to let them make more horrible food for us so we told her to forget it and we left.  While I had barely enough to eat, my wife hadn't had anything so we stopped by Burger King on the way home where the service was quick, friendly, and accurate -- a complete contrast to Flicka's.  Fortunately we weren't there for the drinks and food. Or for the band which, I must admit, sounded great. We were there to gather with folks to see a friend off on a new adventure and that part of the evening went well. Based on Flicka's performance, though, we'll steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"Go here on Thursdays with a team and usually the owner is here at that time. It's an open area, good food, cheap beer. I'm happy :)"}
