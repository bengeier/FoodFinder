{"text":"My wife have been going to this place for 20 years. Recipe very reliable and the taste has not changed. Always hits the spot when I have a craving.The sauce is amazing. Will always be faithful to chicken Benny. Her brother moved to the states but always eats Benny when he is back for a visit."}
{"text":"By far the best chicken and chicken poutine in the world. I can't say enough good this about this place. I've even had friends ask me to pick up some food before I meet them downtown.  
Be prepared for long waits from Thursday to Saturday nights .Delivery can take up to an hour on busy nights."}
{"text":"This place is a South Shore institution.  Regardless of what time you go to pick up your order, be prepared to wait.

Their best item that they do is the poutine.  The crinkle cut fries are quite good, especially when slathered with the BBQ gravy sauce.  The best part of the poutine is most definitely the cheese curds.  Not only are they plentiful, but rather large in size.  The curds are always fresh.

As far as the chicken is concerned, compared to other places on the South Shore, it can't be beat.  You cannot go an entire meal without worshiping the skin off he chicken.  Definitely worth the wait and the eventual bulging stomach."}
{"text":"My family has ordered 2 or 3 times a month for as long as I could remember. Poutine is great! I always get a chicken salad hold the chicken, so pretty much lettuce, celery, peas, tomato and a mayo sauce, it comes with fries, but where my order gets interesting is when I get home I pour their famous BBQ sauce all over the salad, it might sound questionable but it's a sinfully good salad. I always order a 20oz container of BBQ sauce because I just can't get enough of that stuff."}
{"text":"I dream of Benny BBQ (I now live far, far away)...our family has loved this place for years. The chicken, the sauce, the piles of fries, the coleslaw....Great to order in or pick up."}
{"text":"Nous avons commandés 2 fois chez Benny, la livraison prend souvent 45 minutes voir 1h... 
Sur place il faut attendre ta commande et il y a souvent la queue...mais ils gerent bien et en 20-30 min maximum vous serez servi.

Tres copieux, c'est du simple pas cher et rapide. 
J'aime beaucoup leur salade mais j'aimerais qu'ils laissent le.choix de mettre la.sauce vinaigrette a cote.. 

Pour les enfants c'est très (trop) copieux..."}
{"text":"Great for takeaway but not the best poutine around. The chicken is good as well but not sure if it's great! Very prompt service and clean, but a little disappointed in the taste based on previous reviews. Might be blasphemy but Costco poutine may be more tasty..."}
{"text":"Toujours très bon un dîner ou un souper chez benny est toujours simple et rapide!!!

Portion très généreuse et le poulet est toujours a point !!!

Et quoi dire de la poutine Benny tout simplement délicieuse!!!!"}
{"text":"This BBQ Chicken place has been around for as long as I can recall. The chicken is always tasty, but the sauce makes it oh so much better. 
Get a poutine, you will not regret the crinkle fries, smothered in the previously mentioned sauce and cheese curds.
I have yet to try everything on the menu, but it is well worth the wait you endure at this take out counter style rotisserie."}
{"text":"Service rapide de livraison. Toujours mieux de commander avant le rush du midi ou du souper. Portion de frite très généreuse. Le poulet est bon. Plus économique que La Rôtisserie St-Hubert. Mon met préfère le Wrap au poulet croustillant ou la salade poulet. La Poutine est meilleur si commande tout séparé. Seulement dommage qu'on ne peux pas manger sur place mais reste que c'est un bon restaurant express."}
{"text":"Well oiled machine!!!!!
This place is a take out counter and no matter how many people there are, you are in and out in less than 10 minutes!
Apart from the service, they have THE BEST, yes I am saying this, THE BEST, Chicken poutine on and off the Island. 
The crinkle fries stay crispy, the BBQ gravy is salty and heaven in my mouth, the chicken is always moist, and the cheese, oh the cheese, extra squeaky!  Everything is equally proportioned, you get a bit of everything in each bite.
Now, I had the Club Sandwich and that was good too, as well as the chicken fingers. But, when I go there, I always go back for the Poutine.
Try it and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I'm from the states and came here based on the yelp reviews I read. Have ppl never had peruvian chicken before? check out Pio Pio...and go. Even Boston Market has better chicken
This chicken was dry and ordinary. 
The sauce -was interesting, but not in a great way. It was a mixture of gravy and bbq sauce, with some tomato flavors in it. 
We got the whole chicken meal. Came with uninspired half cuts of bread, a quartered whole chicken, and a whole box of crinkle cut fries -completley unnecessary. 
The best part of the meal was the coleslaw -very vinegary, not a lot of mayo, very light and fresh.
We also got the chicken poutine -now that worked. My husband and mother in law loved it. She has sensitive teeth, and the softness of the fries soaked in the sauce and covered with chicken and cheese curds was one of the best things shes had in Montreal
There's no seating, must take out. Very fast"}
{"text":"Benny on Grande Allé is an institution. You go there for the food of course; the rotisserie style chicken and generous portions of fries and the slaw! Don't waste your time at any of the other Benny's though. The one at the Dix30 won't give you the same amount of fries and it just doesn't have the same feel. Grande Alle's Benny has more \"personality\" and it's a cultural experience. Go there and see for yourself. La Poutine est bonne aussi, mon fils l'adore!"}
{"text":"Dans le genre c'est très bon et leur poutine est véritablement en mon sens au rang des meilleures surtout lorsque les frites sont encore bien croquante... Cela écrit lorsque l'on achète des combos depuis quelques temps c'est servi dans un plat en styrofoam qui est arrivé à deux reprises en partie fondu à causes des frites qui n'auront pas passé assez de temps dans l'égouttoir à huile... et c'est assez déguelasse merci quand tu constates cela. Ils devraient tout mettre dans les contenants en aluminium dont ils se servent déjà pour les poutines... Autrement moi je ne commande plus du tout de ces plats qui arrivent dans du  styrofoam par crainte que cela n'empoisonne, surtout lorsque c'est en partie fondu, mon repas."}
{"text":"Great chicken and the best gravy!  The fries are crinkle cut and quite tasty.  I also love the little piece of bread they give you."}
{"text":"Hey toi! Oui toi! Tu n'est jamais venu a St-Hubert? Alors il faut que tu esseye le Benny! Super poulet le meilleur du coin, leur secret; la sauce. Pas la sauce de benny co. qui goûte l'eau de vaisselle. La VRAI sauce benny. Tu file pas pour du chicken ben pogne la poutine c'est sa coche. Tu file santé, un go pour la salade full mayo avec des pti poid.
Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best rotisserie chicken you can get anywhere in the area. It's a take out counter or delivery only, but sooo worth it. The chicken is great but the gravy is even better! I always get the quarter chicken leg, with o coleslaw but extra gravy! Yummmy...."}
{"text":"You want chicken? They got it. You want poutine? They got it. You want chicken poutine? Hey; they got it. 

Great prices and oh my god the portions are ridiculously large for the cost. The large chicken poutine is about 3lbs of seasoned chicken, fries, cheese curds, and oh-so-delicious gravy. Best fast food poutine anywhere, and this is the original so obviously it's the best. When I was visiting my friend for a week I think I ate here every day. It filled me up for the entire day. I want to bathe in their gravy. 

Disclaimer: The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because Poutineville is my 5-star poutine place."}
{"text":"So, to be clear, the chicken is really, really good. The wings are good. The chicken cutlets are good. But it goes on. The cole slaw is really good (and not sweet!). The poutine is OK -- not the best.

The shop is a take-out affair. There's a register and someone taking phone orders. (Outside there are a bunch of themed cars that make deliveries, I guess). There is nowhere to sit.

The only thing I had against this place was that they didn't really speak English. Had to ask for a special menu (which wasn't really an English menu). But once we got past that, everyone was happy.

We brought the food back home and were very, very happy with our choice."}
{"text":"Best chicken place on the shore. The fries and sauce are so good. The only thing is you can't eat there but the deliver."}
{"text":"Huge portions for the price. Chicken poutine for the win. 

Benny's is our go-to when in Quebec and looking for poutine (which is always). We pick up and take away the crinkly fries and cheese curds smothered in gravy to enjoy at home. The regular poutine is delicious but the chicken poutine takes things up a notch. The chicken is a mix but seems to be primarily dark meat. 

There are multiple size options - all of which will come out bigger than you expect. The small is enough for a sitting and a half for me. 

I love the crinkle of the fries but wish they were a little crispier to withstand the gravy and curds. The gravy is the right consistency (not too thin or thick) but could use a little more flavor for my tastes."}
{"text":"My friends and I travel from the States every few years to catch the F1 Grand Prix of Canada. Or at least that's what we tell others who aren't fortunate enough to make the trip. In reality, we're going to consume as many of these chickens as we possibly can. Two or three visits in a long weekend is not uncommon. (I know of individuals who taunt friends who didn't come along by presenting empty boxes of chicken bones upon returning home.)"}
