{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this restaurant on a Saturday night and arrived around 8:30.  After 45 minutes and no appetizer we left. The tables around us advised they waited 2 hours for the food to arrive.  When we left we ran into a couple who had been there since 6:30 and still hadn't eaten. It was 9:15.  Awful service!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 star
I've been here several times.
it's great place to go, hang out with friends and drink.
Everything is great, I love their food and I can eat everyday.
But why 4 star?
I think they need to hire more server or kitchen members.
always so slow and to get next drinks or more food takes a long time.
Great decor and great food but slow service."}
{"text":"I will NEVER come here again.

I've been to this place a few times, their food is mediocre, but was not a place to dismiss overall, until now.

My friends and I came here to enjoy our annual holiday dinner. 

There is a law under the Alcohol and Gaming Commission that allows you to \"Take Home the Rest\", this only applies to wine. This is to ensure that establishments do not over serve wine to patrons. When you order a bottle of wine at any restaurant you can ask the employees to recork the wine so you can take it home. 

This establishment did not know about this and I had an argument with them for over what felt like over an hour. I was first arguing with our server, then I was arguing with someone who I think was the dining room manager, then I was arguing with who I think was the bar manager. 

This place doesn't know the difference between \"Take Home the Rest\" and BYOB laws. Nor do they know the difference between having open alcohol in public areas (open beers in the parking lot) and corked wine. They kept telling me that they will recork it and leave it at the bar so I can come back at a later date to finish, but at the same time they were telling me that they don't have a recork machine? So, then I asked them how they were going to recork my wine so I can come back at a later time? Then they told me it was a separate licence when I clearly showed them on the Alcohol and Gaming Commission, it is not! It once was, if they had bothered to read the licence.

I was getting so frustrated because they were going around in circles. I kept asking for the bill because I wanted to get out and they kept saying, \"we don't have a license to allow people to take home the wine\", \"you are not allowed to take home open bottles of wine\", \"I have been in the business for 25 years\". They showed me their liquor license which only shows where alcohol can be served. 

After I paid my bill the bar manager came over and said that he had read the law and that I was right, that there is a \"Take Home the Rest\". I was so mad that these people have been in the business for 25 years and don't know their liquors laws. After going through all that I still paid full price for my meal they pretty much ruined my night. Thank God for my friends for calming me down. 

I will never come here again!"}
{"text":"MAGGOT IN MEAL!!! - Was just there for a holiday team lunch today, December 23, 2016. Was initially seated in the back but moved to the bar because of a foul smell. Came here because my colleague had been there many times over the years and enjoyed it. We ordered  grilled calamari, seafood antipasto, and caprese for appetizers. For mains we ordered 2 veal piccata, linguine of the sea, and a penne  in rose sauce. My colleague who ordered the veal piccata found a maggot in a tomato. We all lost our appetites, only being half way into our meals and majority of the food we ordered contained tomatoes. The owner was hardly apologetic, did not even attempt to compensate us for our meals until we brought it up and then offered to remove one appetizer. 

We then discussed how a maggot could be there, perhaps the tomato was not properly inspected and that can be understood from all parties considering the volume of food handled but more than likely it has to do with kitchen cleanliness. 

Had the situation been handled properly with a bit of class we may have been more forgiving but I will recommend all those in my network to avoid this place."}
{"text":"I got the calamari as an appetizer and the linguine of the sea for a main. Both tasted fresh and quite good. The pasta was loaded with lots of fresh seafood and the portion was huge i had to pack half away actually!"}
{"text":"We went to Open cork for a birthday gathering. And usually our go to is Scaddabush, mainly due to the location and its convenience for all of us. So I was a little reluctant to go this far. But I'm so glad we went here! 

The restaurant itself is nice, with loads of seating and those comfy private booths which we, unfortunately,  didnt get since it was very packed at the time (around dinner time). I got the Tortelleni Fanatasia, and the sauce was everything!!! It was nice and rich and very creamy, which I personally love. The portions were very large, and despite this I ate it all! Definitely worth venturing out of our comfort zone!"}
{"text":"Been here once, but I'll surely return whenever I get another opportunity. Came by on a Thursday night they had great live entertainment. Their calamari was delicious! The nachos and brushetta were also very good. I also enjoyed their margarita!"}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times, the first 3 visits were OK but the last one is totally a let down.
We waited to be seated for more than 15 minutes and we were ignored by the servers. Waiters were walking past us and none of them decided to stop or call their receptionist.  We were dressed nicely, we were not dressed like a homeless person, so I dont know why we were ignored.
Anyways the first three that we went there the food was ok, the pasta and calamari are good but I hope they do something about their service."}
{"text":"Great patio, probably the best in Mississauga. Moderately priced. Always have 2 high quality German beers on tap. Two patios smoke-friendly and smoke-free."}
{"text":"I really like this place, as the portions are filling and prices are like those in a Boston pizza ($10-20). The first time I went though the waitress was not in a good mood and was very abrupt. Other than that food and desert are delicious."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great cooking skill on seafood.  Noisy at times. A must visit for foodies !!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Made a lunch reservation for 8. Staff were clueless and actually had our group sitting at three different tables in three different parts of the restaurant. Found each other eventually by texting. 

Maybe dinner is different but lunch was terrible. Very limited menu. Didn't have enough menus for a group of eight. Had to arrange the tables together ourselves. Staff seemed very confused. 

Okay so off to a bit of a rough start but how was the food?

Asked them to bring out a bunch of appetizers and antipasti to start. What we got was 4 orders of calamari and bruschetta. Really? That's the best you can do? No meats, olives, cheese...

Lunch orders consisted of pasta, veal and lamb. Massive portions but no flavour at all. Olive Garden can do better.

Lunch prices are very cheap, portions are large but food is crap and service is brutal. Don't waste your money there are so many better places to go in the area."}
{"text":"OMG THIS PLACE !!! 
I can not stress to anyone how amazing this place is ! I love everything about it !
the staff is unbelievably perfect ! super nice, super attentive, gold stars for everyone !
The bathrooms were clean, everything was spotless. the food was delicious and very affordable, drinks were amazing as well, ive tried almost everything on the menu and I love it all ! I would definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant has so much promise but inconsistent with Service.  My Food was very good.but steak ordered beside me had a lot or Grisel.

Ordered Guinness which wasn't poured properly and served in a Budweiser glass.  Moved from the restaurant to the bar and stood at the bar for over 5 minutes before being served.  

Will try again soon to see if this was just an off night."}
{"text":"It is one of my most favorite places around this area. Food is wonderful, staff are well trained and very friendly. Dishes are served within a reasonable time, any issues we ever had they resolved in seconds. 
We are regular guests there :) Favorite meals: blackened chicken Caesar salad, fried calamari, seafood platter and chicken parmigiana )) Lots of parking and very cozy summer patio :)
This location is great for any celebration, for example we rented their back room for a 25th birthday party."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with no reservations. The patio seemed nice and busy with the beautiful weather. A lot of patio space, a side for smokers and non-smokers. Waited for about 5-7 minutes before even greeted by anyone. Several servers saw me standing there waiting to be seated, but no one said anything, until, I believe the owner came in. Seated outside on the patio. The restaurant inside seemed kind of dead. The bar side was nice. There was no bread or butter served to us. The food was just okay. Had calamari for appetizer and penne for dinner. The penne was not great, did not like the sauce. I think its a nice place to have drinks at."}
{"text":"The patio is a lot of fun, casual, with plenty of seats and shade. Inside, there is a bar and a dining room. Both rooms are nice; a little dark, definitely nice for a date or a night out. Sometimes there is live music at the bar too.

There is a dinner menu (the big one with pastas etc). I enjoyed a chicken and scallops pasta in rose sauce - a large portion, the leftovers made for a delicious lunch the next day too. Not too expensive, compared to other restaurants of the same calibre. The bar menu (a small one, which you usually have to ask for) has several cheaper \"bar\" options. There are sandwiches, salads, nachos, calamari, etc etc. I tried several items on this bar menu, and never had a complaint. I enjoyed the grilled veggie sandwich in particular, and I recall the blackened chicken salad being great too. I also like the service here, it's quick and attentive."}
{"text":"The ambiance and service is great. Obviously it's a destination location (you're not just walking by an area like this). The food is OK."}
{"text":"They acted like they didn't need your business. The service was slow and bad and the waiter would give you the dish instead of placing it on the table in front of you.

The taste of food was barely ok and I had diarrhea when I got home. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE. Management must hire more servers for the main dining room instead of focusing attention on bar/lounge, patio. Our male server was very rude from the start. Upon entering, he pointed his fingers to come towards him as if I was a 2 year old toddler in trouble by Daddy. Fine. I walked towards him and he shouted \"sit wherever\" and walked away. No smile, no recommendations, no questions about how the meal was. Pasta was all over cooked. Shrimp portions were great, huge and fresh. Swarms of sketchy looking people coming in and out of the backroom, with envelopes of cash, wearing tons of gold chains. I got a weird mafia-run vibe from this place. Will not return!"}
{"text":"I would have given The Open Cork a 4 or 5 star rating yesterday, but sadly my opinion has changed...
My family and I were seated in the main dining room  earlier today. The room was incredibly loud and our server was very abrupt with us in taking our orders. As soon as our orders were placed, we requested to be moved to the lounge so that we could converse with one another. The manager was very nice and offered to move us right away, no questions asked. We were also given a new server who was lovely. *This review does not reflect her or her service skills at all,she was very polite and apologetic throughout our dining experience.

Within 10 minutes we received the first of our 7 meals (one of the two children's meals we had ordered) 40 minutes later, we received 4 more meals. 
After having been in the building for close to an hour now, we were informed that the last of our orders (2) had not actually been placed in the system. There was no point in having them placed at that point, so we opted to share our dishes and get out. 

Our bill came to us in FULL, with not the smallest credit given back to us for the trouble. 

Our first server was borderline disrespectful, our food was served to us at drastically different times, if at all, and not so much as a soda pop was credited to us for the poor experience. Incredibly disappointed."}
{"text":"I give the place five stars for many reasons. The portions are large. The quality of food is good especially considering the price. Lots of free parking. The interior is nice and modern. On warm days  the patio is must. Have to say one of the best patios in the west End (Etobicoke - Mississauga area ). I Have been to this place a few times and only got good things to say and would recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good ambiance, good prices, but god awful service extraordinaire... andhas been like that for years. This place would be a knock out if they could get their service in order."}
{"text":"A great restaurant for all occasions. I came here on mother's day and I will be coming back 

Pros:
- The food was delicious! I had the swordfish for $28 and I would absolutely recommend it.
- The restaurant is very visually appealing on the inside. The lighting sets a classy vibe.
- Waitress was nice and came to our table regularly even though the restaurant was extremely busy.

Cons:
- We were given glasses with no water. When I asked for water they gave me a cup of water with a straw in it. I noticed other people had their tables regularly refilled with water, but not us.
- The wait for food was around 45 minutes"}
{"text":"Let me break down Open Cork for people that might be a bit confused by it...

- the service is slow, a lot of waitresses speak broken English and yes, it'll take for fucking EVER to get your food and sometimes even your drinks - don't even try bothering with reservations
- the owner Peter is awesome and he's there EVERY DAY and NIGHT 
- the food, once you get it, is amazing
- the bar area is awesome - dining area is a little old fashioned
- the patio is fucking AWESOME!!!! this is the place to be in the summer I'm here about 3/4x a week (even if I want to just go grab a coffee)
- family friendly? maybe inside the dining area during lunch or something - NOT on the patio (it's a very European place, every single person smokes)

If you don't mind lounging around and waiting a bit longer for food while enjoying drinks, smokes and good company, Open Cork is for you. It's a VERY European style place (even in terms of attitude, etc...) so if you're not used to it, don't bother coming."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential. The food is pretty good and well priced. I really like the atmosphere; it has the feel of a downtown bar but in the suburbs. Here is my beef: if you're going to spend the kind of money that you did renovating the place, spend a few bucks on training the servers. While the servers seem nice enough, they just seem to be lacking in knowledge and customer service. This happens every time I go there, which signals a problem with the management rather than the servers themselves. It's too bad, cause this place could be a 5 star with a few tweaks."}
{"text":"Gotta try the jambalaya & linguine of the sea. 2 of the best dishes you'll have anywhere."}
{"text":"The Open Cork is located at the north east intersection of Southcreek Rd and Dundas St E in Mississauga, just west of the 427 and Etobicoke Creek.  This restaurant has been here on Dundas for quite some time.  While I've seen businesses come and go along this street of Dundas between 427 and Dixie, The Open Cork is one of the few places that has been here for what seems to be decades if that.

While it's been years since we've been, we recently went for a small private room banquet get together.  The space we had was appropriate and closed off but well lit with enough space that we didn't feel squeezed in.  The place itself has a modern upscale feel to it as the décor and furnishings make it feel quite modern.  The bar, interior dining areas are intimately lit while the outdoor patio would be also be a good choice for dining if the weather would be agreeable. Basically as far as ambiance this place is a nice, formal type setting.

The food was also quite good and the service was professional.  I had the chicken while my wife had asked for the salmon.  Being that this place is an Italian restaurant we only had a few options as our selections for the reception (pre-selected menu choices) but it was still good."}
{"text":"The word that comes to mind is average...everything about this restaurant could be summed up as average. There was nothing that stuck out as overly terrible or great. We went here for a business lunch, service was friendly, decor was nice, and the restaurant itself was at a decent location in correlation to where my company was.
The food was a bit lackluster. We ordered a couple of appetizers to start off with, some fried and grilled   calamari. Straight off the bat, there were a couple of issues with texture, size and seasoning-lacking in each department a bit. The grilled ones were abundantly notable with the under seasoning. The char marks left the meat of the calamari bitter and the lack of salt did not help to balance out the taste of the acidity of the tomato sauce and the bitterness. The bruschetta lacked the freshness and zest of the traditional dish, instead we got a heavy bread dish baked in cheese. 
Moving onto the entrees, I ordered the Lamb chop, requested medium rare. Instead I received an under-seasoned platter of medium-well to well done lamb morsels. I would have loved a large piece rather than the 8 pieces of mini chops as those are notoriously difficult to cook to the right doneness. I was a little off putting that beyond the overcook and under seasoning, there was a slight (what I could only describe as-for lack of a better word) \"fishy\" aftertaste. This seems to be the consensus of my fellow diners when it came to the red meats - both for their lamb and steak dishes. 
I did not-could not-enjoy the dessert and drink menu as I was quite stuffed (bordering dangerous itis territory-not a state I would voluntarily put myself in since there was half a work day left to conquer). The coffee and desserts offered, through testimonials, I heard were great and presentable. 
The overall experience was not terrible. Service was great and relatively fast-they were quick to accommodate for our needs. The waitress and hostess were friendly and quite professional. Prices were reasonable for the setting. It's by no means a culinary must-try but it's a nice place to conduct corporate lunches and dinners due to their large variety of offerings."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to come here for a party so we had a huge group. 
I had ordered the steak and when it first came out it was well done when I had asked for a medium rare.. pish posh. I sent it back! And they gave me the perfect steak after that. So A+ for that. I must say though they were a bit slow but that is because we had such a big group."}
{"text":"I went to Open Cork on Valentine's Day for the first time. The restaurant decor was beautiful, server was very cheerful and helpful and prices were very affordable. Unfortunately the food was a bit disappointing. It came with good portion but they used fake crab meat for the seafood pasta dish, caesar salad was lack of flavours and steak was kind of tough and lack of flavours."}
{"text":"For my husband's birthday we went her with my in laws and brother in law!

We ordered:
Cold basic bread with butter
$8.95 calamari
$5.95 mixed greens
$6.95 Caesar salad
$4.95 chicken/rice soup of the day (scraps of left over) but good
$12.95 seafood pizza so yummy but got soggy quick- very yummy
$12.95 parmigiana really good- veggies/potatoes- slight salty
$14 jambalaya parpadella
$15 seafood linguine- looked good
$6.95 apple pie- cold

Service was understaffed, larger party next to us got better service! At one point we flagged him down to ask for water and he went to ask the other party if they needed anything and when they asked for water he refilled everyone of theirs first, then seem to forget until we made eye contact...
Huge portions of salad, apps and entrees, the quality was fresh and wasn't affected by the big portions.
Pricing was relatively cheap for portions and Italian in a nice restaurant.
Could be romantic, darker decor and leather seats.
Marinara sauce was fresh!
Calamari was crispy and stayed that way.

Overall

Nice decor, slower wait staff, cheap and delicious food, dessert was just ok...but a lot of others we didn't try. The reason this gets a 4 star is really because the food is worth the service! Otherwise the Service would be a 2 star. The patio look like it was bustling with a good crowd.
The inside had a lot of different bottles of wine decorating the walls which I though was a nice touch, although I didn't get to sample the wine because I was driving but definitely next time.

Would definitely come back and hopefully will sit on the patio where service might be more balanced. So many other dishes I want to try!"}
{"text":"The food: They couldn't get steak right. Ordered medium rare it came to me medium well.  They didn't even own up to it. 

They told me the steak cooks itself and if I wanted medium rare that I should have ordered rare and that it would come to me medium rare. 

What? I thought if I order medium rare I get medium rare. 

Place is ok inside, service is alright. I wouldn't trust it for any occasion other than just drinks, but even those are likely watered down."}
{"text":"I've been to the Open Cork MANY times but sadly the food is just not that good. I also feel like it's gotten worse over the years. Honestly the best part is the bread and butter basket and even that's not fresh. On my most recent visit I had the bocconcini salad which I thought would be fine! It was a huge disappointment, what should have been the best part (the bocconcini) had been drenched (possibly poached for days) in some garlic concoction, even when I tried to scrape it off the intense garlic taste was there. Furthermore the salad was covered in really bad dressing oh god it was just awful so I would definitely say DO NOT get the bocconcini salad. I was with someone who got the caesar and it was actually really good. Also the person that I went with has been in the bathroom all night so... 

Their one redeeming quality was their service, the waiter was incredibly patient and courteous and the servers all had smiles on their faces. I just wish that their food was a better."}
{"text":"This is more of a patio / beer with your friends environment for that I say it would be great but for a family not so much.  I had the veal parmigiana that was cold on one side and not very tasty.  The pasta was way over cooked and my 5 year old daughters pizza looked like something she made.  she had one bite and said i don't like it so in my opinion this is not fine Italian dining.  Looks abit run down, actually the Decor inside is kind of crazy looking. You walk in thru the main entrance into a hall with white walls and dimples all over it I felt like I was in a giant golf ball.   Service was decent but we just wanted out ASAP after tasting the food.  Maybe this is why the prices are so reasonable"}
{"text":"The veal is terrible! 
It tasted like cardboard. I couldn't finish it. It might of been the bread crumbs. 
The breaded chicken wasn't good either. It wasn't fully cooked, and again the breaded layer (bread crumbs) didn't taste fresh. 

The calamari is delicious. Prices are great! Good portions!"}
{"text":"Well I've been here before a few years ago twice actually and wasn't much of a fan ...mostly due to the service to be honest .
But today a few of us came here to the patio , and boy was I pleased !!!
The food was actually very good ! Very fresh and very impressed ! Good portions aswell ! 
The atmosphere both outside and In very nice .
All in all It was a good afternoon and I'd definitely come back , atleast for the patio ."}
{"text":"Waitress was rude but apart from that food is pretty good and portions are huge for the reasonable price. Will return :)"}
{"text":"I recently took a trip over to the open cork for my anniversary dinner. Upon arriving I noticed their beautiful patio. The patio is right at the front of the building which is located right in Dundas. While sitting their you didn't feel like you were on a Main Street at all!! There were so many plants and they covered the patio beautifully. The service was very prompt with our waitress coming by frequently to check on us and take our order. We had the calamari (basically a staple in our diet when eating out). It was served as a huge portion and was very yummy. Our meal came shortly after and I was so full from the calamari I could barely finish eating it. The food was very tasty I had the rigatoni pasta and my boyfriend had the squash and lobster ravioli. This restaurant came highly recommended by all of our friends and now we can say we know why. The prices were very reasonable for the quantity of food we received. I heard that their chocolate mouse cake is a must try but unfortunately we were too full to try it out. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I went with my family to have Sunday lunch here. I had heard many great things about this place and wanted to try it for myself. The restaurant itself is very beautiful inside, very cozy. We were seated near the fireplace which was very nice. In terms of the food, it was just an ordinary Italian menu you would find in most Italian restaurants. Nothing really stood out. They had 5 different specials, but it was hard to remember what they were since there wasn't a special menu and the waitress didn't really know how to explain what they were. The prices were reasonable for the type of restaurant. I was expecting it to be more pricey based on the finesse of the decor, but gladly the prices were great. To start we ordered the Poseidon Calamari - it was just normal fried calamari, really big portion however. My husband ordered the seafood linguini which was very delicious. I ordered the squash ravioli lobster which was ok, not very well seasoned and a bit on the sweet side due to the squash. I found it to be a bit bland, where I had to add salt and pepper - which I never do at restaurants. My son had the kids penne with rose sauce which was just ok.
Overall it was a nice, reasonable, family-friendly little Italian restaurant to go for lunch or dinner. I do believe in the summer the patio experience will be better so I guess I will write another review during the summer for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had group reservation in dining room. Patio was full, no host at the empty dining room entrance as group arrived. Drinks were not great, Pina Colada tasted like milk on ice, orange cranberry juice tasted like flavored drink not juice. Server listed the Specials of the day without listing prices, when the bill arrived the Rib Eye Steak Special was charged at $49.95. The Veal Saltimbocca Ala Romana sauce tasted off with too much oil. The Vegetarian Risotto had too much Garlic. The pastas were OK. The Clam chowder and Caesar salad were good."}
{"text":"@OPEN_CORK #OPENCORK #MISSISSAUGA #LOUNGE #YELPGTA

My first time here and I was pleasantly surprised. It is now one of my favorite restaurants in Mississauga. And I can't wait to go back. Want the fine-dining or lounge-ey feel without having to pay, say, Cagney's high prices? This is it. I want to try everything from their menu, but here's what we did order: 

Meat Cannelloni: Don't be fooled by the size. This is such a share-able portion! And absolutely delicious. I was craving cannelloni and #noregrets after this one. 

Also, ordered one of the veal dishes. Cooked perfectly.

Margarita Rating: 5/5 (Massive, rimmed with a ton of salt, just the way I like it)

Can't wait to go back. If you want to try something new in Mississauga, this is it. Because chances are, you haven't heard of it. Such a hideaway!"}
{"text":"My friends have been raving about The Open Cork for years so I finally decided to join them for dinner just prior to Christmas.  Let me tell you, this place did not disappoint.  The restaurant itself is just beautiful inside.  Nice tables with comfortable seating and super clean bathrooms.  The service was outstanding and the owner came around and greeted everyone.  They had a huge wine and mixed drink selection and even had Keiths on tap.  It was hopping inside with a couple of big groups but mostly tables of four.  Great value too.

The Poseidon Calamari was exceptional - good size serving, fresh, crisp, tasty and a delectable dipping sauce.  I had the Orange Roughy and it was so fresh and prepared to perfection.  The rice was al dente and it came with a nice variety of perfectly grilled vegetables like squash, baby bok choy and zucchini.  My only complaint was that the king crab on top was the fake crab but they made up for it with lots of big, fresh shrimp on top.  Two of my friends ordered the Linguine of the Sea and the other ordered Penne Gorgonzola and they all enjoyed their meals.

I plan to return next month with my husband and another couple!"}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying I really enjoyed my time at Open Cork during our work Christmas dinner. Service was good. Forgot the name of our waiter but he was courteous and funny as hell. It felt authentically Italian. I ordered the seafood antipasta and lamb provencia; The portion sizes were generous and that's putting it lightly! Only qualm the whole night was the seating arrangement as we were a big group of 20. They could have arranged and combined two tables together."}
{"text":"Always yummy food (love the chowder, veal and all pasta dishes) - only complaint is that they should have fresh horseradish for their oysters!! And keep an eye on the ladies bathroom for some reason the toilets never flush :S"}
{"text":"I was in town for business, and a friend and I decided to check this place out. It's very rustic looking, and that intrigued me. We went on a Wednesday night and the place is separated into the bar area and the lounge. We opted to sit in the lounge. One thing I really appreciated was that there's a wall and completely separate area for the two places. So while there was the odd rumbling of a cheer,it was quite quiet. Very quickly, we were brought fresh bread with butter. There is an extensive wine list, but keep in mind that wine by the glass is only the house wine. Anyway, the menu is extensive and the options are varied. Everything sounds so delicious that it's hard to decide. I picked the jambalaya parpadelle, and my friend got the pesto linguine from land and sea. The prices reasonable, and the food was definitely delicious. The from scratch pasta, the giant shrimps and chicken, and everything seasoned perfectly. The portion was huge and I couldn't finish it all. So the food gets a perfect score from it. It was absolutely scrumptious. 

The place that this review loses stars is the service. Our server seemed a little less than helpful. He was unable to answer questions about recommendations, unable to answer questions about if the wine my friend ordered would go well with her dish. After our food came, the server was nowhere to be found. I'd like to point out that there was no rush by the time we came (it was about 7 in the evening) and only three tables had customers. The server cleared up our table shortly after we were finished. There was no offer of tea, coffee, or dessert. We would have said no (we were so full), but it would have been nice to be offered. He brought the bill, and when we said that the one bill wasn't sufficient, and we needed separate bills. He seemed annoyed and told us he couldn't do that now. It's important to note that he never asked us if we wanted separate bills (it's the norm to ask these days I find). We asked to speak to the manager at which point he whisked the bill away and came back after about a minute with the separate bills. Can't do it anymore... What a joke. 

So, if you're in the mood for some delicious Italian food,  this is definitely the place to come, but don't expect decent service."}
{"text":"Went to The Open Cork for friends birthday for the first time.  Great atmosphere, service and food!  Our waiter Angelo, was very accommodating.  We had 2 kids and asked if they can make spaghetti and meatballs for them, the chef said no problems.  My husband and son ordered the special which was steak and lobster (surf & turf).  When the entry came out we realized they served us surf & surf.  We told Angelo you made a mistake, he was very quick to change the order and apologized for the mistake.  Didn't  mean to complain but they had to have their steak!!!...will definitely be back:)!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. My fiancé loved his lamb chops and the pasta dish I had was delicious. The prices were quite reasonable too. Only docked a star due to slow service (particularly in the beginning). The servers made up for it with how kind and friendly they were though. The decor is pretty, I could definitely see this as a nice place to take a party."}
{"text":"I came here a few years ago with family and I remembered the pasta being really good and the seafood portion being generous. My cousin decided to have her birthday dinner here and everyone was rubbing their bellies with satisfaction. My mother ordered the penne Gorgonzola which she enjoyed. I ordered the mussels in a white wine sauce, a side of pasta in a cream sauce and the house blush wine. It was perfect. I would not change a thing. They renovated the resturant and it has a very trendy lounge feel to it. This place is perfect for family dinners, drinks and conversations or date night."}
{"text":"My normal eating and drinking areas are Junction, Queen West and Bloor West so this was quite the culture shock !
A very large space in the 905 with patio and many rooms inside. Has a cruise ship vibe actually. The 80's Euro theme runs as deep as the ocean. Without irony. Men's shirts are unbuttoned further than normal, ladies sure love their make up and helmet hair abounds on both sides of the gender fence. But their customer base is non judgemental which is fine for Mississauga. Service was cheerful and the customers seemed to be enjoying themselves without a Hipster in sight.
I had the escargots and my friend had the calamari, both smothered in a strange and gas inducing tomato stew. Huge portions. The house wine was fine, although pitched as red or white.
Besides feeling like a fish out of water I would return for a main course as the apps were bizarre."}
{"text":"Finally came here with some friends to try out the food and was not disappointed!

I was a little apprehensive because some reviewers mentioned the service aspect but I found it was fine. The servers were pretty attentive and the food came reasonably fast.

For starters we had the Bruschetta, grilled calamari, steamed mussels in white wine and an arugula salad. (see my pics!) 

My wife totally enjoyed the salad. Although we did find the mussels pretty small....the wine sauce was nice.

For mains, we had the seafood platter for 2, steak and a lobster pasta.

The seafood platter was huge!! We ended taking about half of it home!
The steak was nicely done and so was the lobster pasta.

Finished up with a couple of shared cakes.

Overall a nice meal and nice atmosphere and a reasonable price.

I will be back!"}

{"text":"I usually stay around the Square One area for italian food but my friends and I decided to venture out and try this place for a birthday celebration dinner. I've always passed by this restaurant during my commute downtown and it's left me curious as it seems like a very nice place on the outside. The patio looks great, unfortunately it was a chilly fall evening and patio season is over. 
Our party thoroughly enjoyed our food there. They had a selection of vegetarian options for my friends, which is rare to see at the other places we usually go to. The restaurant had a very nice interior with lots of space (would be great for a party, whether business or casual). The wait staff were prompt and kind. 
We ordered pasta and an item from the grill and we were all very impressed by the pasta and the grilled chicken pollo. The portions were of good size. It was a very nice ambiance and we were not rushed with the bill after the wait staff took away our finished plates. 
For my first time here, I was impressed and I do look forward to coming here again for lunches/dinners as the ambiance is lovely and the prices are quite reasonable for the quality you get."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today with my beau. The place was humid and sticky, Owner was at the bar getting Hammered, server was high on something, bathrooms were out of order, no music in the background and the food was complete garbage. Would never go back even if someone paid me."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before and I never leave disappointed. The food was really good and there was so much to choose from. We went there for a friend's birthday party. The service was OK but nothing special. The server wasn't too organized, meaning, two people at our table were already drinking espresso's while others hadn't even gotten a dessert/ coffee menu. 

Other than that everything was really nice. The atmosphere was relaxed and warm. The food was good. We had the cheese platter, calamari and bread for appetizers. For the main ... I had one of the specials... lobster alfredo with shrimps. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food which was good. For dessert I had a latte and a truffelicious ... amazing! Had a bite of the home made Tiramisu ... even better.  

During the dinner the owner came to our table to check on us, he sent a nicer bold cheese along with our other appetizers and after wards sent us a round of drinks on him. Nice touch. 

I would recommend Open Cork without hesitation, however, the atmosphere is soooooo much more lively on a Friday/ Saturday... I went on Sunday so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Big fan of Open Cork. Very reasonably priced and tasty food! They have a great selection of food. I always have an excellent experience there, the staff are attentive, professional and friendly. Good ambiance and great for groups."}
{"text":"I love this place they have great live entertainment, a great patio scene in the summer. Decent wine selection and food is great. I love the grilled calamari as well as the pizza's r yummy. Nice modern decor, very clean. If you can get a seat by the fire place"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday with 8 close friends. 

I had made reservations prior, so when we showed up the table was ready and we were seated quickly, although Reservations have been tough to make before (I come here often). They have also renovated recently, bar area is really nice. 

The food here is good, it's not amazing, mouth watering, let's write a cook book about it, but for the price you pay and the serving size you receive, it's great. 

I show up hungry, always leave full and my wallet leaves happy. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"It was my friends birthday and we decided to have it at Open Cork. The site said it was fine dining, friendly service and casual atmosphere, which was definately how I felt when I was there. My friend had reservations for 30 people, so we had the backroom all to ourselves. They had leather couches and a fire pit in the middle that gave a really good atmosphere. The menu was pretty diverse, Sea Food, Pastas, Steak and Chicken. I started with a Bruchetta as an appetizer then finished off with the Salmon entree. I love Salmon, baked, fried or raw and this was definately one of the best Salmons I ever had. I highly recommend this place! Great staff and good food."}
