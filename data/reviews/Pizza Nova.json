{"text":"This location is really friendly and the shop itself looks pretty cool. They have good quality pizza, but it's ends up being too expensive if I get all the toppings I actually want. $7.99 medium pepperoni special ftw :)."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Go here sometimes and the place is fairly good.  The prices are good and pizza taste really good! The cashier is always friendly and patient and recommend really good stuff. The only con is that it takes a while to make but they are making a pizza from scratch....  Recommend this place to anyone who likes to sit down and enjoy a hot pizza! Also recommend the vegetarian! So good"}
{"text":"Very few toppings on the pizza. Tasted very bland and even though we took it a block over, got cold very quickly.  When asking about pricing on their various styled pizzas (since it's not posted anywhere including the menu), they seemed annoyed.   While waiting for pizzas, wanted to use restroom but was out of order.   After ordering 2 pizzas (a M and L), they gave me 2 napkins when I asked for them. TWO. when I asked for more, gave me another 2 napkins. When I asked for more again, they gave me another 3.   Not impressed at this Pizza Nova at all."}
{"text":"Pizza is generally good here and only reason I give 1 star because I ordered a pizza and the cook didn't wash hands before making it!!!! I know this is a must otherwise 4 star would be good.  This is a big concern for food stores... please make sure your employees follow the health rules!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick pizza, and it was worth it! They finished the pizza quickly and didn't skimp on the ingredients. Definitely a good place to get pizza if your in the area."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious, On time and friendly. What more could you want? I get the pepperoni walk in special and it's a tasty filling treat at a good value. I would recommend getting a drink from the shoppers across the street to save a buck."}
{"text":"You want pizza done right?  Whatever you do, DO NOT come to Pizza Nova especially this location.   Twice in the last month these morons who make the pizzas cannot read the instructions. When a customer asks for the cheese on top that means the cheese goes on top of the toppings.   Right? That was easy! Nope not here, the cooks don't bother to read nor do they give a f@$&. The excuse I got was \"sorry we are busy\". So sad, too bad.   First time mistake I got over it. This second time in a month just clearly shows their gross incompetence and that they just don't give a rats a$$ about their customers.   After coming here for the last 5 years and spending close to $40 every visit for about 2x every month, so long Pizza Nova, your stupidity is no longer acceptable and you've lost me as a customer for life.   And when I need to order pizza for work which is usually about once a month and a couple of $100's, I'll ensure that you do not get my business nor any of my friends, coworkers, and all of my professional network. You can't fix Stupid and here at Pizza Nova proves that point."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza chain in Canada. The food and delivery service is excellent. They always used the freshest ingredients and also affordable. I recommend this place for anyone who really likes pizza in general. Although it is far from my school its worth the travel to go."}
{"text":"Pizza Nova is great, connoisseur grade pizza, best in Scarborough. Best hot peppers in the business and a crust second to none. Prompt delivery."}
{"text":"Good place for a slice. Location is clean. Too many pizza places in the area. Pizza pizza , Dominos , and pizza nova so lots of choices"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had at a chain and the guy working was friendly. It was late and there was an extra pizza left over. He offered it to me and my friend at a discount. This is my new favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"Pizza is like any other pizza nova locations - good, but the customer service was HORRIBLE. I went in and the workers were openly yawning very very loudly. There were leftover garbage on the tables that a customer left that wasn't cleaned up the entirety that I waited for my large pizza there and there were HUGE clanging and slamming sounds that startled me - and trust me, I am not one to be easily startled."}
{"text":"Always good, always fresh. The topping choices are excellent. Love the white pizza options with pesto. This is our go to pizza parlour !"}
{"text":"I walked in to this pizzeria at 9:05pm to order a slice and There was three slices left none of which were cheese or pepperoni. I asked how long it would be for a cheese slice and he told me he was no longer making any tonight... I noticed the store close at midnight so I guess that means he would go all the way until midnight with no cheese slices or any type of variety for any customers coming in. The slices that were there were old and did not look appealing. I will not be returning!!!"}
{"text":"Ask for the walk in special and you will not be disappointed ... Anything else you are just taking a gamble as with most pizza chains. Their pepperoni pizza is sure value and you will be delighted with the quality of the pie and pepperoni. Staff is very helpful and polite."}
{"text":"The worst pizza I have ever had. Do not go here. It is awful. The crust is hard. Tastes like cardboard. This is so bad. If I could rate it a zero star I would. It may only be this location but it says a lot about the company"}
{"text":"Pizza at it's best. Top quality crust, chesse, sauce and toppings.   It doesn't get any better really. I reviewed this location because i think it is the one that delivers to me. but I have had Pizza Nova all around the GTA and they are always the best Pizza."}
{"text":"The guys working here are jerks. I walked in soaked out of the pouring rain to get a slice on my way back home from the gym. The guy doesn't even acknowledge me until I tell him I want to order something. He then proceeds to ask me if $4.95 is OK. I set his attitude right when I pull out my black credit card. Jerks."}
{"text":"This location makes some really great tasting pizza, though, as for all Pizza Novas, it's somewhat on the pricey side. Has good selection of \"gourmet\" toppings."}
{"text":"Don't ever order from here. If I could give this place a -1 I would. This particular Pizza Nova is absolutely horrible. They never cook the pizza thoroughly. As I noticed this I began to think, maybe I should specify well done. I still received an undercooked almost raw pizza. So I figured let's say extra well done.... I still got a raw pizza!! Every time I have to re-cook the pizza in my own oven when it gets to my house. The pizza makes you feel gross and sick every time. This pizza Nova is just horrible, the workers don't care about what they send out, and they clearly don't read the delivery notices. I highly suggest ordering from somewhere else and going to pick it up if this is your delivery district. The worst pizza Nova around. They either need new ownership or need to be closed."}
{"text":"Best Pizza Nova I've been to in my opinion. Have tried all the other ones in the area and their not the same. The quality at this location is top notch and service is excellent. Always order pizza and wings and they never seem to disappoint."}
{"text":"The service is friendly and the slices are quick! I tend to go here because the location is convenient. As a bonus, the intersection is well-lit at nighttime and I find that there are usually fewer creepy drunk guys hanging out on the street around here late at night (as compared to other pizza places located east of Bathurst or along Queen West)."}
{"text":"Great staff, friendly, quick, very fresh, very tasty. Reasonable prices.  Ordered the medium walk in special, asked for seasoned ground beef instead of  pepperoni and they had no problem with that, nor should they or any place for that matter :)  The place was lively with customers and clean. I've been here many times and had improved quite a bit but it was always good."}
{"text":"The pizzas here are amazing especially when they are think crust and well done. I have also tried their chicken sandwiches, potato wedges, and chicken poppers. They are all amazing with very good portions and high quality ingredients. Delivery is always quick and the food is piping hot. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because they do not have good deserts that can satisfy a group with different preferences. All they have is a sort of Italian biscuit that is kind of bland."}
{"text":"This is the last time I'll be ordering from this particular location.   The first couple times I ordered from there, the food tasted great. However, the last couple of times I've ordered, not only did the pizza taste off but I was running to the bathroom all night and also feeling like I was going to barf. Last night was the last straw, as today I still have bad diarrhea and feel nauseous.   Either the oil has gone rancid or someone isn't washing their hands properly before preparing the food. Nevertheless, please be aware if you order from or go to this location and look out for your own health."}
{"text":"Pizza-wise my favourite in town along with Reginos; yummy fresh ingredients, good crust. 1 star deducted for making ordering difficult and a little more expensive than others. Great pizza all in all."}
{"text":"I love this place. This is the only Pizza Nova branch I've ever eaten at, and plan to eat at. The hawaiian pizza with sopressata and mushrooms, is the most delicious thing I've ever eaten! I usually stop by and get it directly since this ensures its freshness and hotness. The staff are pretty nice too! The price, to me is kinda expensive actually, but totally worth it once in a while!"}
{"text":"While Pizza Nova is classified by many as just another greasy pizza place, in reality it is actually so much more. The staff is friendly, the pizza options are numerous, and the pizza itself: Delicioso!!!! The best way to go is call ahead and make your own pizza, as it tastes phenomenal, much better than the pre-set pizzas already there. While it may not be true Italian taste, it is definitely much closer than Pizza Pizza, Pizza Hut, or any other pizza chain. Highly recommended if your looking for pizza and this is in your area. The prices aren't too cheap, yet not extremely high either.  Definitely got to try it out at least once."}
{"text":"I have to give this place a 5 star for 2 reasons.  The first is that the pizza is really good.   I very much enjoy it.  The other reason is the service.  We once came back on New Year's Eve after a 12 hour drive and popped in here to grab something to eat.  They were really busy and it was gonna be a long wait for some pizza.  The owner offered us a medium pizza that someone had ordered and cancelled and he gave it for a discounted price.   He was really reasonable and seemed to genuinely care about his customers which is hard to say in the pizza making business.   Would recommend and return."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service, and they always get my special request order correct.  Thank you for being allergen aware and accomodating!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but customer service is poor. Particularly, the old guy is so grumpy and does not like to be asked for anything. The younger  guy is very good."}
{"text":"Ordered at 8:20 pm told it would be 30-45 minutes as of 10:30 pm they'd never showed even after calling at 9:45 and they said they were on the way."}
{"text":"Five stars cause this pizza nova consistently delivers the same tastes and quality over time."}
{"text":"Clean store, nice staff, quick service and tasty slices! I recommend this place to others and will definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I love the pizza well done. I highly suggest turning on your stove to 475 when you order your pizza (well done). Then pop the pizza in the oven for 5 minutes after it arrives and you'll never order another kind of pizza again."}
{"text":"Was about to go into Pizza Pizza when I saw Pizza Nova across the street and decided to give it a try.  Location is nice and clean.  Great selection of pizza.  I ordered the Chicken Florentine, even distribution of grilled chicken, spinach, and feta with pesto base. Nice crunch on the thin crust down to the last bite.  Will definitely come back to try other flavours.   Sitting along the window seats and noticed Domino Pizza will be opening across the street as well.  There will be lots of pizza to go around for everyone.  :)"}
{"text":"This review is not a review on the product, but instead the service.  Pizza Nova makes a fine pizza...a little pricey but well worth every dollar.  However this review is specific to the walk-in service, and only applies to this location.    If I could go back and spit in the mans face...I would...but its not worth my time.  I walked in yesterday to buy a pizza for dinner.  The older gentleman behind counter did not acknolwedge me.  Eventually he looked over and barely said two words.    Although there is a general menu above the counter, I asked for a menu...like a delivery menu as they usually list combos (pizza and wings etc).  And he did not respond...he muffled some words and that was it.  I asked 3 times and did not get a real answer or a menu.  So I asked him if they had any combos...and he bascially muffled something like...\"I don't know what you want\".  So I gave up and ordered one large pizza and as I listed the toppings I wanted, he gave me a hard time because I mispronaunced one of the ingredients.  i asked over 6 times and he had to be rude about a mispronounced ingredient when he clearly knew what I was asking for.  I went shopping next door while my pizza was beng made.  And when I returned and as he handed me the box, I said a big nice 'Thank you' and he turned around and walked away without saying a thing.    I was flabbergasted at the service, or should I say rudeness I received.  Grumpy old FART!"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst pizza place ever - service is so slow - took forever to get two large pizzas -"}
{"text":"First time ordering, and the pizza was phenomenal!  Ordered the thick crust, so crispy and light, the tomatoe sauce tastes fresh, abundance of delicious toppings!!  Excellent pizza!! Got a discount for picking up, nice touch!!  Price is incredibly reasonable, the quality, top notch!!  Will definitely order again!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, always fresh, friendly staff, always enjoyable to order my pizza from This Pizza Nova.  I recommend this pizzeria as a go to pizza place"}
{"text":"Great company with good core values too.  Went today for the $4.39 medium pizza. $1 of which goes to support Variety Village.  Awesome cause and tasty pizza too. Staff is ready and happy in spite of huge volume of customers today. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I hadn't had Pizza Nova for a while, but I remember it being much better value.  I had a pepperoni pizza here the other day, and it was more reminiscent of a 3-for-1 pizza joint.  It was cheap (but expensive), chincy on the cheese and pepperoni, and the crust was like flavourless dry cardboard.   The sauce was quite good however, and the storefront is very clean.  It also took 20 minutes for a medium 1 topping pizza at a non-high traffic time."}
{"text":"You can see all the fresh ingredients from the counter. The service was friendly and the food looks and tastes amazing. Other pizza Nova locations makes you second guess yourself if you should order their food, but this location is spotless and has friendly welcoming staff."}
{"text":"Old college friend dropped by, we were having a few beers and he wanted to order some pizza.  Closest pizza place near me is this particular Pizza Nova location, so I decided to order from them.  Ordered online through their website, it was pretty convenient, we ordered a Party Pizza with Pepperoni, Bacon and Sauteed Spinach.  The pizza showed up in about 25 minutes which was awesome, I love getting delivery fast and while it's still hot.  The pizza was delicious, y'know for delivery pizza it was above average I found, nothing spectacular but good enough for me to go right to their website and order whenever someone comes by and wants to order pizza.  My only problem was with the price, my 3-topping pizza came up to almost $34, almost $40 with the delivery tip.  All in all I would recommend ordering Pizza Nova if you want a decent order in pizza and if you're not on a tight budget."}
{"text":"I used to order here all the time, unfortunately the last two times I ordered my pizza wasn't cooked correctly I like my pizza thin crust well done.  I like my cheese brown and bubbly.   I asked the person on the phone to underline well done which he did and obviously it was not   I stopped ordering from them and started ordering from Jingles up the street which is excellent pizza! Tonight I thought I would give pizza nova another shot unfortunately again my pizza came it was completely white! Dominic you need to get on top of this store.  I Lived in the village for years and always ordered from here,never a problem( I also noticed pizza was better if ordered on a Friday night,not sure if it's a different cook) Even after I moved I still ordered from them.....NO MORE.   Pizza nova came and picked up this pizza refunded my money  and offered to make me another pizza I declined."}
{"text":"Great store and great staff. They are always smile to welcome when customers step in this lovely store.   More importantly, I left my cell phone in this store and worried I probably will loss my phone but one lovely staff(Mujgean) picked up my phone from the table where I sited and returned back to me when I back looking for my lost cell phone. They are honest employees.   Definitely five stars, they deserve it."}
{"text":"Love the pizza but what is up with your call centre reps? They are full of attitude. Hate calling to order, they have no people skills what so ever(  Rave: I actually took notice of how lovely my rep was today because of past bad service."}
{"text":"I order my pizza lightly done all the time.  When I got there to pick up though the pizza was a bit overdone to my liking. The manager was the one who was handling the order at the time, apologized and came up with reasonable solution: he said I can wait while he makes me another one OR I can pick up this one for a couple dollars less.  Deal or no deal?  I didn't want to wait another 10min so deal. I bought the pizza at a discount.    He promised that he will make it right the next time,  just when I call in - specify the cooking time of 7 minutes.   Next time I order here I feel better knowing that if the pizza is made not to my satisfaction they will actually do something about it to make it right.  That's okay in my books."}
{"text":"Walked in and got the L 9.99 peperoni pizza special.   It was done perfectly light as I requested. Feb 8/12 early afternoon.   I didn't take a photo but should of because the peperonis were laid out beautifully like a work of art. Excellent preparation by the pizza maker."}
{"text":"Honestly, Pizza Nova is the only place i consistently go to to satisfy my pizza cravings. Just these other places don't do it for me like Nova does.   The toppings are always so tasty, and just the taste of the pizza is always so good. It can be a bit pricy depending on what size and toppings your getting, but it's so worth it especially if your getting a party pizza. My delivery experience wasn't so great as it took almost 1 hour and 20 min for it to come, but other than that it's great!"}
{"text":"My friend usually orders from this Pizza Nova location and never had any issues until the recent ordering.  Since I was able to, I walked the block to pick up the pizza and upon opening the box back at the apartment, to our dismay half the pizza was burnt at the bottom.  The crust was a little crispy, but for the bottom of the pizza to be burnt, one cannot consume that.  It's just not healthy or enjoyable.  My friend called customer service and was informed that another pizza will be ready for pickup in twenty minutes without charge to replace the first one.  Since my friend is a regular customer, this was the first complaint.  Therefore, No need to return the burnt pizza or show photo proof of the burnt pizza.  When I returned the second time for pickup, the friendly cashier was surprised to see me, but someone at the back, possibly the Manager, knew why I returned and handed me the pizza box.  Before leaving, I checked the pizza  because  I wanted to make sure it wasn't burnt.  Half the pizza crust was a little crispy, but the bottom wasn't burnt at all. What a relief!  I wondered if this location was even aware there may have been an issue with their pizza oven or were they hoping that no one will notice that half their pizzas were overdone? How many others have complained about this issue?  So much for consistency for the franchise, but if you want quick and inexpensive pizza, this is it!  We were happy that customer service was apologetic and able to provide us a free replacement pizza, but the inconvenience of a second pickup when we're hungry wasn't pleasant.  Thankfully the location was close by, but I was happy this wasn't my local pizza place."}
{"text":"The bread is soft and brittle, the cheese is softer and tasty, and I like to eat this Hawaii pizza?it's better than pizza pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Toronto!!!  Not greasy!! Excellent!!!!  Thank you!!  We will be back again!!!"}
{"text":"I've gone to this Pizza Nova a few times since I work in the area and there isn't much around; just the usual fast food stuff, such as KFC, McDonald's, Subway, Pizza Nova, Burger King.  It's usually always crowded, as there is a school nearby and the plaza that this Pizza Nova is located in gets overrun by kids. Because of this, the restaurant is usually dirty on the outside. The staff (I go during the week) are quick, yet angry and have a face that just shouts \"why are you here? Do you think I got into food to deal with people? Hurry up and get out!\"  They always seem to have fresh slices; I've ordered pepperoni and cheese, Canadian, Hawaiian, vegetarian, and tried every other slice they have available, and they've all been very satisfactory. The basic slices are about $3.50, the gourmet slices anywhere from .20 to .70 cents more.  I have not ordered a full size pizza, so I can't comment on how they are.  For a cheap, quick meal, it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"From montreal arrived in town, ordered deluxe pizza, fries n sprite. Well this is just ok taste like Franchise food like pizza pizza, not much cheese lil pepperoni  all bread no tomatoe sauce for 28$. Definitely not Italian food. I would suggest avoid and get non franchise place for that price you can get much better especially in Woodbridge which is all Italian place."}
{"text":"Was actually shocked .I walked in here last night to grab a slice with much skepticism I might add. Judging from a previous experience at this pizza nova I was not to excited about my selection to say the least, as my elevator rose to the 22nd floor I could not help but be intrigued by this scintillating aroma coming from my single slice pizza box. After entering my room and began to eat I could never have imagined that I would be thanking church street pizza nova for making a near perfect slice of pizza! I got a Hawaiian by the way"}
{"text":"I place my delivery order from the location on Airport and Derry but couldn't find it on yelp. Anyways I would like to mention it's fast delivery and on the consistency and freshness. Also I've never received a wrong order from them."}
{"text":"Pizza was subpar and wings with Italian dry rub were burned and too salty. Will not order from there again. When I called to complain they said they would give me a credit but they wanted to pick up the uneaten wings...."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed. New management. One of worst pizzas I ever had. Way too much sauce. Unevenly spread. Was way cheaper on cheese than old owners.   DO NOT GO.   FROZEN PIZZA IS BETTER."}
{"text":"Recently I noticed a sign outside my local Pizza Nova advertising a medium pepperoni pizza for $4.39 on Tuesday May 12 for walk in customers. $! from each sale is going to support Variety Village.  I walked in today and tried one. It was a fresh tasty well made pizza. My only quibble was that it had too much salt for my taste. I applaud their gesture of support for a fine cause. The regular walk in price for that basic pizza is $8.49."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite Pizza Joint/Restaurant out there. The staff are well trained and familiar with the menu and food. Received a perfectly well done Gluten free pizza with dairy free cheese, and vegetarian topping made perfectly on time. Will be my go to for pizza and late night cravings.   The display of slices are so colourful and mouth watering always giving you something new to try! Wonderfully Delicious!"}
{"text":"Clean. Open late. Pizza. What else is there to say? Well you could get a salad or garlic bread. All are reasonable. I know because I've tried. Staff seem really nice but pizza joints don't really let you feel the vibe because you are only there for a few minutes. Limited seating."}
{"text":"Best service of all stores  Cashier guy is sick pizza 10/10 and very fast Pizza nova here 901 king street a go to spot slices or 5$ but are worth it compare to the Trash pizza pizza"}
{"text":"I found the pizza to taste pretty bland. It doesn't really have great flavour to it and considering the price, I don't think I'm getting what I paid for. I haven't had their sandwiches yet but considering my first time there, I might end up regretting it. At least my drink was cold.."}
{"text":"Great location if you live in the area and want to get pick-up or delivery. Their thin crust option for a pepperoni pizza was delicious. And they have a nice selection of dipping sauces.   Very good for ordering then taking away, although they do have minimal seating if you need to stay in and eat :)"}
{"text":"I have picked up 2 pizzas today. They are horrible. We buy Pizza Nova occasionally for 20 years but this time it was so bad that you cannot chew it. Extremely dry, no cheese and not fresh. I have called the customer service, no help there, escalated the call to the management. They offered to return Pizza back to this location but it is 12 km away from my home. I have picked it up on my way home.  It seems Pizza Nova standards are down, and this location produces pizzas that are not eatable. Stay Away."}
{"text":"Saturday evening we ordered a thin crust well done pizza for pickup. It was just coming out of the oven when I arrived.  On the table within 10 minutes and still warm!  My wife had one bite and moaned her disapproval.  The pizza was so salty that it was virtually inedible.  So bad that she phoned the company immediately to complain.  The young man she spoke to had a recommendation.  Next time order the black olives instead of green ones.  $26 in the garbage and rest assured there will not be a next time."}
{"text":"We had their walk in pizza and we both didn't like it.  They were cheap on the ingredients."}
{"text":"This is my second bad experience here. I vowed never to return.  Should have stuck to it.  Recently revisited this location.  My order (by phone): large pepperoni, single dipping sauce.  My request upon arriving: the special, 2 dipping sauces, 2 cans of pop.  The staff of 3 men refused to remove the first dipping sauce at full price, and insisted I take 3 dipping sauces and 2 cans of pop.  After pretending not to understand my request and holding up the line, they passed me a phone, to pizza nova head office.  The woman on the line told me my request was no problem.  I personally felt the need to apologize to the patrons behind me in line for holding them up over a $0.75 item.  How embarrassing.  I will never return.  There's a great dominos across the street."}
{"text":"Ok pizza, but not worth going out of the way for.   Crust: crisp if thin crunch under overly air filled dough.  Diagnosis: lower than optimal gluten   Sauce: fair enough.  No high notes of fresh tomato.  Likely to be sweetened with sugar or corn syrup and brightened with citric acid.   Cheese: abundant but utilitarian mass market blend optimized for browning on top, but no sense of gooey melt or strings."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! I get from here whenever the craving hits and I love that its consistently affordable, prompt, and delicious! Best of the Ontario pizza chains, hands down."}
{"text":"Always my go to place for some quick pizza. Delivery is fast and always fresh. Never have any issues with Nova!"}
{"text":"Great food ok price. The problem with this place is the guy that runs it and the staff. Rude doesn't even begin to describe them. They could use some customer service training."}
{"text":"I love the friendly service and the quality of the food.  If you walk in to pick up a pizza, it feels like an old school neighbourhood pizza place with a relaxed vibe and personalized service.  You get your pizza made perfect you and exactly as you want it, no matter the request.  Love this location and happy it's near my home."}
{"text":"Here's where this place wins its points:  I ordered a pizza online on my iPhone and it arrived in 15 minutes (on a Saturday night)!  They have gluten-free crusts, lots of tailored topping combinations, and many ways to customise your final order.  Here's why I didn't give them 5 stars:  The outside edge of the crust was burnt black but there were other parts near the middle that were soggy.  The crust was way too thick for my liking.  Not very generous with their meat toppings.  Will I order from them again? Sure, on a busy weeknight, they're a good bet."}
{"text":"It's a Pizza Nova. It gets 3 stars for that, but loses a star for the tiny ants on the counter near the window. These things happen, but it was the lack of surprise the  employee demonstrated when I told her. Like, \"oh, those again?\"  My California Veggie slice was good, though!"}
{"text":"Very bad service, I didn't fully understand the order and the so called manager came to the front after the cashier being rude to start off with and using the rudest customer service I ever came across and raised his voice at me! Moreover, gave me the dirtiest look! Like wow, I can't believe this kind of customer service still exist!"}
{"text":"The worst pizza I have had in my entire life -- took two bites and through it out. No flavor, canned toppings. Tasted like a bad frozen pizza."}
{"text":"One of the better pizza places around. I like the full pieces of bacon, the results are consistent and the sauce has a nice zip.  I find I don't get heartburn like at some other places. I always ask for well done, it's great.  If you're into gluten-free, their crust is the best I've tried.  Gluten-free is thinner so be warned that well done may give it a slight crunch.  Canadian is always a good choice."}
{"text":"I'm always excited to try a new a pizza-by-the-slice restaurant, but unfortunately Pizza Nova didn't meet my expectations. Perhaps I've been spoiled by NYC pizza slices, but I didn't find Nova to be anything nouveau. My friends and I had a pepperoni slice and a ham and pineapple slice. There were tons of toppings on each piece, but it tasted like it had been sitting out for hours. We ate here at lunch time, so I expected a piping hot, fresh slice. Also, these are average sized pizza slices. If you want a gigantic slice the size of your head, look elsewhere.  Pizza Nova is a small restaurant. We wanted to sit down to eat, but with no benches outside, we were confined to the counter which only had three stools. One of my friends was left to dine and stand.  Pizza Nova may be good for delivery, but from what I had after walking in the store, I'm not convinced I'll try them again."}
{"text":"Incompetent, rude customer service with useless and very ignorant deliverymen. Pizza is also overly salty. Do not recommend!"}
{"text":"Pizza Nova overall is new to me, however I do like them more than Pizza Pizza. This one specifically needs some work on customer service. This is a location in a new plaza in a developing neighborhood and this is a convenient feature!"}
{"text":"Since this is walking distance from my house and from where I work I find myself here a few times but it seems the more often I go the worse the pizza and the service gets.  Although the variety is half decent, with my favorite selection being the Inferno or the Meatfest the actual base of the pizza gets more and more burnt and harder each time.  Along with the evolving worseness of each slice there is the service, there is nothing more I hate than someone getting served before me just because they know someone there, and when it is so blatant that they do not serve you next then grrrr unleash the inner beast!  Would prefer to go elsewhere but hey its convenient and open till late so for now I will give it three stars, until the next time they CHEESE me off!   A pun good enough to bring a tear to Vivek's eyes"}
{"text":"Honestly I'm livid. Here's the deal, I'm minding my own business waiting for my extra large triple cheese light sauce pizza. Doorbell rings, I'm instantly turned on, I'm ready to munch. I swiftly run down the stairs light as a feather and elated. I open the door, riddled with anticipation. The man doesn't even say hi, whatever. I say hi, whatever. He hands me a bag of pop and dip, creamy garlic, OBV. I place it on the ground. He reaches into the bag for my pizza, I get butterflies. All of a sudden, the butterflies are DEAD. This man has the audacity to present me with a medium pizza. I politely decline, \"I ain't eatin dat\". We discuss the situation. Remember when Fred Flintstone gets kicked out by the Sabre tooth tiger or whatever? It was kinda like that. I call Pizza Nova back and give them the scoop. They didn't even offer to give me a years free supply of pizza as compensation. Like??? Anyway, I felt guilty enough sending pizza man away even though he gave me hella attitude, but they should have offered me a deal for now having to wait another 40 mins for their mistake. Pizza Nova? More like Pizza No Good-Va.  *UPDATE* the new pizza arrived and when I wanna ent to pay he said it's free, all is rectified"}
{"text":"Such a dry and burn pizza slice i got it . I asked them to add extra chese then my baby can eat without dried. They added then dough was overcooked then taste was burned. My baby usually likes to eat pizza this time even she didnt eat it and i throw it. Thanks then i got it only slice ."}
{"text":"A good selection of slices. Fresh and delicious. Nice friendly staff. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This chain pizzeria is pretty much like any other around Toronto. Toppings are standard, really not much to say. It does hit the spot after an alcoholic binge or when you get the munchies. But for a more memorable fire oven pizza with amazing toppings check out Guido n Friends!"}
{"text":"I like to consider myself an aficionado when it comes to pizza. Growing up in an Italian household I had first hand exposure to the good (mom + nonna), the bad (when we'd go out and mom/nonna would send it back for being shit), and the ugly (Pizza Pizza - sorry dudes your pizza is to Italian food what dirt is to the bottom of my shoe).  I have me staple joints that are safe spaces for pizza pop-bys all over the 416 and 905. They're tried, tested and true, always a good experience. Then there is Pizza Nova, a one-time local small business that was (and still is) family owned but has grown into one of the biggest pizza chains in the Toronto/Southern Ontario area. It's downright lovely.  I'm torn because part of me thinks \"hurrumphhh, chains, they just wash, rinse and repeat everything, there's no love, no soul, no spirit\", and yet, Pizza Nova continually seems to execute at a high level... pie after pie.  To make a great pizza you really only need TWO things. Good dough... and good sauce. Everything else is immaterial because without these foundations, your pizza house isa gonna falla downa. Have you seen the leaning tower of PISA... yep, built on bad dough and sauce and look at what happened! Pizza Nova has a great sauce, and when freshly delivered it's close to parity with what I grew up on.  This is our go to for delivery because the best local spot (FBI) requires a second mortgage to buy their pizza and aside from Pizza Pizza (which I wouldn't buy from unless destitute or drunk and making bad decision), Pizza Nova has been a constant, reliable, enjoyable Pizza experience for lazy Friday dinners to entertaining with friends  Plus I mean Pizza!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"We ordered One Large Hawaiian Pizza, with onions on one half, and olives on the other half. We had it delivered.  For $32.00, we were totally disappointed. Whoever made that pizza was extremely chinsey. There was barely any cheese put on the pizza.   As well, as each topping, ham, pineapple, onion, and olives, barely any of the requested toppings were put on the pizza.  The dough was nice. I'll give them that. Just too cheap on the toppings. Totally wasn't worth the money we paid.  We won't be ordering from Pizza Nova any time soon, again. There are for too many other options out there."}
{"text":"I showed up around midnight on Friday for a Veggie slice and unfortunately they didn't have it. I had paused a movie at home and was really hungry so I asked them when it will be ready and  the lady said about 20 minutes. I figured I might as well try some other places in the mean time in case someone else had a veggie slice available. Surprisingly the 3 other pizza places in the area included pizza pizza, pizza depot and  city pizza didn't have a veggie slice. I went back to pizza nova and they still didn't have it ready :(. However, as 20 minutes hadn't passed yet, i waited and upon seeing me the girl at the front whose name I don't know (it was her birthday) went to the back and they made a small pizza for me, cut out a slice and gave me an extra half slice. The slice was great, up there with the best of them. more importantly, they gave me special attention, went out of their way to make me happy and actually made a really good slice."}
{"text":"Toppings were great, time and service were wonderful. All three pizzas we ordered were delicious. Sausage, bacon and pepperoni. Ham and pineapple/cheese. Feta, spinach and tomato. The crust was a perfect blend of crispy and soft on the inside. Definitely my favorite in the area"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday around 5pm.  - Service was slow - Pizza was overpriced  - Taste was ok"}
{"text":"If you're feeling lucky and pizza nova is the only place open, then go in and maybe eat some pizza, or maybe order some if you want delivery. It's only going to be bad half the time.  If you feel like having chicken wings/pollini with your pizza? You're better off eating your own foot. Basically what they serve as chicken wings here looks like food that's been left outside for weeks, and tastes like that too. Extremely dry and hard to bite into. This has been the case the last 3 times I ordered from this location.  Like another reviewer said, i'd feel like less of an idiot if i just flushed my money down the toilet. I finally learned now, just avoid this place, no it's not a fluke, they just have terrible food and its their intention to serve it."}
{"text":"What use to be a cut above the usual crap served by most franchise pizza joints, Pizza Nova  has slowly fallen below the bar of crap. Does anything more really need to be said?  I ordered a small square $4.95, I displayed shocked at the price, the server told me it was gourmet! Really? It tasted like the same crap. The only thing different at Pizza Nova than the crap they serve at Pizza Pizza is the same crap at pizza pizza is cheaper. I told the guy behind the counter \"you got me once but you won't get me twice\".  Good pizza in Toronto is next to impossible to find."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Pizza Nova before, but this one impressed me. I only went here because it was close to where I live and I wanted to try pizza while I was in Toronto."}
{"text":"One of the best locations of Pizza Nova in the GTA. Love coming here because the staff are super friendly and the food is consistently great! Highly recommend if you want Pizza and you're in the area."}
{"text":"Best Pizza I have had in many years. Sauce was amazing, pepperoni plentiful, just well done Pizza Nova! You have me hooked."}
{"text":"Sadly, the most inconsistent pizza joint I've ever seen! I can honestly say I've had a truly great pizza delivered from this pizza Nova location, as well as some of the most disappointing pizza I've ever ordered as well. I'm not sure if it's a chef issue or a pizza oven issue or a supplier issue, but you just never know what you're going to get. The focaccia barese can be excellent, but tends to be overcooked, and the pizza is sometimes overcooked, sometimes undercooked, and sometimes amazing. Every now and then I am lazy and decide I'm up for some pizza roulette, and I spin the wheel and take my chances on what will be delivered, but usually I just drive down to Danforth Pizza House and pick up my pizza, so I know my experience will be excellent."}
{"text":"Perfectly passable place for a slice. No ambiance and the green colour is horrendous but the pizzas are decent. Last week I had the Hawaiian. Nothing special but nothing horrendous either.  Certainly a bit tastier than pizza pizza across the way."}
{"text":"I have to say i don't usually order pizza from Pizza Nova. But last night i gave it a try.  We ordered online and quickly got a follow-up phone call confirming our order. The reason why my friend and i ordered from Pizza Nova was because she needed a gluten-free crust, and my usual place didn't offer that. Hooray Pizza Nova! She got her gluten-free pizza and i got my regular thin-crust pepperoni. Both looked and tasted great :) I'd say the food was 3 star A-Ok. But the service bumped it up to a 4 star for me. Delivery was quick and the delivery guy was happy, fun and joking around with us, braving the frigid temperatures for our hungry tummies. The pizza was still piping hot too.  Note: although they do offer the gluten free crust, it's only offered in the medium sized pizza and isn't offered in a thin crust, just the regular hand-tossed."}
{"text":"Having eaten pizza every Friday night for (possibly) the last 20 years, I can call Pizza Nova the best of the best.   Every Friday I order a pizza, preferably sticking to Pizza Pizza for it's continuity (not for it's actual enjoyability), that was until I found Pizza Nova. I will never say a meal changed my life, but it renewed my faith in chain-restaurant pizza. The pizza's have a homemade look and taste, and avoid that overly processed taste of the competitors (pizza pizza).   Plus, recognition goes to their jingle. \"439 oh-oh oh-oh pizza nova\" rings in my head all Friday night (don't judge my sad existence)."}
{"text":"A late night pit stop - the smell of freshly made pizza drew me in to this spot. It was super cool to see a wall of tomato sauce can- cool piece of art. The pizzeria was quite casual. I liked there was a small area to wash your hands next to the counter-maybe be for employees (don't remember!) I ordered a medium cheese pizza for 10$ to go. I chose to have fresh pizza, the ones on display looked old from the day. There was complimentary chili oil- that I enjoyed. The pizza wasn't too greasy and had a good throughly baked crust. It was soft and chewy. I didn't feel heavy after having it either. Service was kind off- when a man a behind us paid for his order first. I don't expect anything less from a fast food pizza joint. I would choose pizza Nova over double pizza or Dominoes any day."}
{"text":"Just got a slice today and it was very good. The service was fast but the price was a bit higher than I'm used to. I will return again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is my most frequented Pizza Nova location, and my fave pizza chain. I come here about a few times a month, usually for a slice, but sometimes for a pizza. Delivery is always fast. If I order for pick-up, my order is always ready in the time specified. Pizza is consistently good. I am in love with the wings here. Service is good as well."}
{"text":"Been here a few times after recently moving into the area. The customer service is pretty good but the pizza has almost always been bland and tasteless. Maybe that's just pizza nova in general though..."}
{"text":"Ordered a Family Special that came with 2 medium pizzas, 6 pop, potato wedges and pizelle.   Delivery was just over half an hour and the driver was really weird. He didn't seem like he wanted to give me the bill. He opened the warming bag and basically made me pull the pizzas out myself, which was difficult because I still had the bag with the pop in my other hand. He asked if I was okay, but did I have a choice?   Thankfully, the pizzas were good. We got thin crust on both, which I'm sure made the toppings seem more generous. I had anchovy, hot pepper and green olive (yes, I am a disgusting person) and my boyfriend had sausage, spanish onion and mushroom. The anchovies on mine were pretty mild. I actually had to add more from a bottle in my fridge. But the hot peppers were nice and plump.  Potato wedges were decent-- they could have been really soggy being in that box, but they maintained a bit of crispiness thanks to the coating on the outside. Pizelle were negligible. I'll probably put them in the pantry and make ice cream sandwiches in the summer.  Overall better than Pizza Pizza, costwise, not as expensive as more gourmet places, but at least they actually deliver the pizza, not like Pizzaolio, who, when we ordered the pizza, didn't deliver it because they called us back and we didn't answer."}
{"text":"That's right everybody, I am reviewing Pizza Nova as my 100th review! But this isn't just any Pizza Nova. This is a great Pizza Nova. I'd like to call it the best but there is just far too many locations for me to have tried them all yet since I just moved to Toronto three years ago.  The funniest thing about this is that I gave this place five stars purely based on the quality of their food. The pizza is f'ing fantastic! I originally bought pizza here because my sister was on a hockey tournament and the team ordered pizza from Pizza Nova for the team and I had some and though \"you know what, this is plain ass pizza but it's good, and apparently cheap\". I realized, \"hmm I think there is a Pizza Nova location around my house, I wonder how it is?\"  So the next time I wanted pizza I called and asked about their specials and found out about their $9.99 walk-in special which is a large pepperoni and due to the restaurants proximity; perfect for me!  The other great thing about the pizza here is that you don't feel guilty for eating it. It's not overly greasy or anything like that. In fact in actually might convince you that you've made a healthy choice in eating it due to it's lack of greasiness. Plus your getting dough, marinara, cheese, and pepperoni; carbs, vegetables, dairy, and meat! It's like an all-encompassing food choice! GO PIZZA!  In conclusion, this place is great for those nights where you'd just too pooped to make food and then clean up afterwards. And it's not too expensive either ringing in at only $11.29 after taxes!"}
{"text":"After their renovation a couple of years ago, this place is awesome! It was pretty good before, but has improved greatly. It's fast, the staff is friendly and chatty, and the pizza is pretty good!  Ask for it well-done, and it's even better!"}
{"text":"So after my daughter's preschool class, we wanted to take her out to eat and she enjoys pizza.  As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by the friendly young man who also gave my daughter a friendly greeting!  We all got a slice of our own...cheese, meat supreme and Hawaiian...it tasted so fresh, maybe cuz we came in at 11:30am closer to opening time and they were just made.  But it was still good!  The meat supreme one was a bit salty for my liking but what do you expect with the pepperoni, bacon and sausage lol  Great customer service!  They even turned on the TV for us and picked a kid friendly channel for my daughter...sometimes it's the little things that go a long way.  Also, we couldn't decide how to make our combos, so the gentleman told us to get what we wanted and he'll work it out for us combo wise that best suited what we got.  Also, right now they have a prize winning peel off thing on the slices.  My husband and I got the 'play again' and my lucky little monster won a free large pizza with 3 toppings!  Using that next time for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss depending on who's working, and tonight was a miss.  Pizza Nova is by far the best chain pizza store, and they're usually pretty consistent, but this place is the worst one I've ever frequented.  The pizza tonight tasted almost like nothing.  Not sure why the couple who own the place refuse to put more than an ounce of sauce on the pizza, but that's what you basically get from them.  You dont even taste the sauce, that's how little they put.  The lack of sauce throws off the whole balance of what a pizza is, so all you taste is dough, cheese, and toppings.  It's more like a sandwich with no condiments than a pizza.  We didn't even bother finishing the whole thing, which is unheard of in our household, that's how bland it was.  If there was a better option in the area I wouldn't bother with this place, sadly there isn't."}
{"text":"I have also gotten sick from this place (or highly likely). I've ordered several times without any issue, but at least a couple of times recently I've gotten sick and I see no reason to go back."}
{"text":"Pizza nova has some unique specialty pizzas that makes me order it over its fast-food pizza competitors. I ordered the portibellissimo, which is a mushroom pizza. Delivery was about 20minutes after placing the order via phone. They take cash and credit card. However, the delivery person had an issue with the credit card machine, so it took a while for the machine to connect with its network. Order here if you want something other than cheese or pepperoni pizzas."}
{"text":"Came here during the 5$ pizza sale, I feel like the sizes they gave was smaller than usual. It was about a 1 hour wait at 530 pm. The pizza was ok, nothing special."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent hot and crisp pizza. The Pizza Pollo is my favourite. Very close to UofT campus, great for a quick lunch. Definitely a great choice."}
{"text":"Wouldn't take much to improve on the run-down Coffee Time that used to be in this place.  It's no revelation but it's newly renovated, reasonably clean and the pizza tastes above average for a slice chain.  If you're looking for something great, try Queen Margherita. If you want a decent slice quickly, this is A-OK."}
{"text":"We decided to try a new place for pizza delivery. Our pizza was burnt quite significantly. If we hadn't have been so hungry, it would have been garbage. Extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"They got me at the right time.  Big traffic jam on the 401 and decided to shoot up Leslie Street to the 407 and after being stuck on the road for going almost nowhere for 90 minutes i was pretty hungry so i stopped here for some chow on the run. That hit the spot.  Never been to a pizza nova before this but will certianly give them another try."}
{"text":"This review is for the delivery. I was tired of the same old pizza pizza/dominoes, they either put to little sauce or the pizza is burnt to shit. After a friend had told me about a bruschetta pizza that I had to try, I decided to order pizza nova. I ordered a medium bruschetta and medium deluxe. both pizza were delicious. very generous with the toppings. the bruschetta pizza is one of my new favs. If I could eat a bowl of just that I totally would. The deluxe brought me back to Montreal style point de pizza. Food is good when it gives you flashback memories. The pizza scene in Toronto is getting intense. One of my top 5s for pizza."}
{"text":"What can I say? Who doesn't like pizza? Pizza Nova's been around for some time now and they're gotten better with their signature pizzas. If I had to chose from all the fast food pizza place - Pizza Nova wins hands down.  One thing I'm always on the fence on trying are their sandwiches. I'll let you know what I think once I try it."}
{"text":"I've ordered Pizza Nova since it first opened.  It's far too expensive for what it serves.  I can't help but feel that the wings I am eating are made from deformed reject chickens, but at least the sauces are OK.  The pizza itself isn't that bad, I'm just really not feeling the price tag for such an average meal."}
{"text":"Ordered pick up via online - easy simple process. It told me it would be ready by 15/20 mins and so i went around that time. Overall service was efficient - got my fresh to made order once i arrived. Pizza however was just mediocre - i remember pizza nova tasting better before."}
{"text":"I'm not a regular Pizza Nova goer (in fact today might be my first time ever), but I've definitely been to my share of pizza-by-the-slice joints. Maybe this is par for the course at a Pizza Nova, but this place was a great big meh.  The service was friendly enough and they had enough selection in the case when I walked in at 5:30 pm that I could choose between three or four veggie options, which is a definite plus. But the pizza I had (Mediterranean) was pretty flavorless. Maybe it had been sitting around too long, but that's not my fault. And the few tables they had to eat at were covered with crumbs. I didn't see the person at the counter or the kitchen staff running around getting ready for the dinner rush so you'd think one of them could take two minutes to come out, wipe off the tables, and pick up the newspapers, but I guess not. On the bright side (literally), the place has nice big windows!  The long and the short of it is, if you really need a quick bite, this place will do, but in this 'hood, you can do better."}
{"text":"My brother and I were staying at the Sutton Place hotel down the street, we hadn't eaten dinner yet, and it was getting pretty late. I googled for eateries in the area and most of them were closed by 10:30pm. Since this was the closest and still open at midnight, we decided to eat here.  The place seemed clean and the cashier was nice.  My brother ordered a sandwich (he wasn't in the mood for pizza), while I got a slice of sausage pizza. His chicken sandwich (if you want to call it that) was about 70% bread, 25% chicken, and 5% lettuce/mayo. It was not very savory at all. My sausage pizza was decent, at least as good as sbarro/dominoes/etc. But I definitely have had better on a college campus, most notably the pizza-by-the-slice place at my alma mater. Prices also seemed a little high for the quality of food. Everything was fairly warm and decently prepared, but in the end it was not tasty or savory enough.  Maybe we were expecting more, but Pizza Nova just did not hit the spot for us. I've had better pizza of this ilk elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pizza Nova is my favourite pizza chain!   The reason why I'm posting a comment on this specific location because they always go above and beyond to make sure I'm satisfied with my pizza.  I always receive exceptional service when I visit.  The pizza delivery driver, to be of Vietnamese decent I believe, always shows up with a bright smile.  Can't say nothing bad about this location, rock on guys!"}
{"text":"I'm impressed by two things - the quality of the pizza itself (good crust, great sauce, generous toppings) and the speed of delivery. I thought the prices were completely fair for what I got (I believe it was a $2 delivery charge). I am totally satisfied and would definitely come back.   So why not 5 stars? Well, because it only gave what I expect from a pizza joint. It didn't exceed. I'm looking for a spot that gives me dirt cheap, hand tossed specialty pizzas. That's a 5er. And Pizza Nova? It's cheap, delicious pizza you can shove down your face. No complaints, but only 4 stars."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, Like the dipping sauce.  Wings = no good...quite greasy and breaded?? did not like"}
{"text":"This review is only for the bruschetta pizza ! Soooo good ! Didn't try anything else but my dad had it at a friends one night then we ordered more since he said the flavor was really good.  He was right, there was one seasoning that was stronger but I still enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Toppings are top notch, the sauce has enough garlic and scared away a possible cold. the crust was devine.   Our go to place for payday pizza and sink free of dishes."}
{"text":"One of best late night pizza i had in town! We need a pizzanova in every corner. Hope they expand."}
{"text":"Yup these people own the best pizza nova. Great service friendly always happy and it shows in their pizza. You'll be disappointed in the rest after visiting the best. Good people nice pie to hit you in the eye.  Who needs the moon!"}
{"text":"Not all pizza novas are equal. This one is nowhere near the Bathurst street location. Night and day. Nothing is ever coming out fresh. How long have those slices been there \" about 2hrs was the reply. Other location a pleasure lots to choose from 2 minutes away."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this location for the past 4 years. Love Pizza Nova, especially thin crust. They have number of specialty pizzas like; Calabrese, Banquet Cheddar, Quattro Stagioni...I also recommend their wings and pasta."}
{"text":"Was at my parents house on Saturday and we ordered a party size pepperoni and mushroom pizza. Was absolutely delicious. Great location!!"}
{"text":"Ordered some slices there... Was really hungry though would not eat at any other place in the area. Pizza was eatable. That's all. Unlike anywhere else (pizzerias), the personell was pleased with my order and they offered me a variety of toppings."}
{"text":"Very rude gentleman working during the night. I asked about the medium pepperoni pizza special for 8.99. I asked to substitute the pepperoni for another topping. He said \"don't worry about the posting, just tell me what you want\". I thought he was giving me a deal, then I realized he charged me for the extra toppings I asked for. I mentioned the special again and he starts telling me the price of each topping. I sticked to my one topping pizza for 8.99 and walked away. Old and very rude person with terrible customer service skills."}
{"text":"4-3-9 00-00 Pizza Nova!   Came here to make my own vegan pizza with daiya cheese. Yes this is one of the few pizza joints that offers vegan cheese at no extra cost. Pizza tastes great. Fresh ingredients. Great crust. Quick service. Reasonable prices.  Lame jingle. Great pizza. Give them a shot the next time you want to order pizza. You already know their number."}
{"text":"Not sure how long they leave their slices out (i'm assuming all day until someone finally buys the last one), but they are always dried out, stale, and hard. The pizza's may be decent if you order a fresh one but for what they are charging per slice (nearly $5 for the gourmet), I would take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I've had in GTA in a year. Pizza is defined as its freshly baked base and toppings both of which were perfect.  Staff is friendly and upbeat and the store is nicely designed. Would surely be a regular for future!   Cost for 2 : $20  To try : chicken wings , lasagna"}
{"text":"I walked into the Pizza Nova at Church & Wellesley and ordered a small pepperoni pizza and small order of chicken wings on early evening of Sat. May 7th.  I said I wanted blue cheese sauce with the chicken wings and I asked to see the blue cheese size to make sure it was enough. She told me that sauce comes with the chicken wings and did I want mild, medium or  hot.  I said I wanted blue cheese and I paid for that one and she made it sound like it was mandatory that I have this sauce with the wings, so I said I would have mild sauce on the side.  I was shortchanged when I paid for my order and she tried to figure out the error and handed me another dollar. I was still shortchanged by a minor amount but I couldn't be bothered with it and I went and sat down to wait. I got the order home and the wings were soaked in this horrible hot sauce.  Needless to say they went right in the garbage.  I'm never going to Pizza Nova again.  The staff don't listen and it's too frustrating to deal with people that can't count the right change. The pizza wasn't very good either; very little pepperoni."}
{"text":"They have the worst pizza I think from Nofills cross from this pizza STORE GOT a pizza last week payed lots money is Not cheap not it is worst pizza went back to complain they don't care at all I think is to go nofills buy a frozen one Never again"}
{"text":"Pretty standard pizza nova joint in a good location on Bay St.. Food is what to be expected. No complaints.  A little bit bigger than other locations and have some cool aspects to it. For example, there's that giant tower of tomato sauce cans! Neat."}
{"text":"Pizza tastes bad. Cheese is weird and flies are on the window. I suggest avoiding all pizza places on harbour street, there are a few. Waste of $7 slice."}
{"text":"Stinks outside, washroom is disgusting the only redeeming factor is inside,with pizza that is fresh and crispy. But you can get that at any location, and those locations don't smell like raw sewage"}
{"text":"Good pizza. But I don't get why it is more expensive than the other pizza places. Paid 6.50$ for a slice and a drink. I think at other places you would pay little less. But these guys keep their place clean. Very well maintained restaurant. The guys working inside are friendly and quick.  I'd come back for a slice or two but that's about it."}
{"text":"The place is clean. The pizza is pretty good. I just didn't like the Italiano attitude."}
{"text":"Very fresh, and tasty pepperoni pizza. The sauce oozed out of the cheese, the crust was not too thick and not too thin, the pepperoni was crispy, and cheese was the right amount of stringy when hot. The sauce tastes of fresh basil, oregano, sweet possibly from onions, and stewed tomatoes not salty or too acidic. The crust was fluffy like a delicious pizza pillow. deduction for parking in the wrong place and getting the second pizza we ordered wrong. as well as hanging up on us then, being rude when we explained what happened. Delivery man was rude, wanted a higher tip after being extremely rude to my very pregnant  coworker over the phone, and in person.basically bad customer service when we order every holiday."}
{"text":"average pizza at best. It gets a 1 star because I ordered delivery and was quoted 30 min... 1 hour and 10 minutes later it showed up cold and the Coke warm. Would not order again."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from pizza nova last week. Pizza sauce tasted like canned tomato paste. The dough was burnt. Delivery was fast."}
{"text":"I like Pizza Nova the best,  The dough, sauce and cheese are really good.  Recently tried the Pizza Pollo and I like it, but overall there are a lot of choices with specialty Pizza's."}
{"text":"Maybe couple of weeks ago, a handsome staff who looked like a soccer superstar working undercover trying to hide his charm and the service desk helped us retrieve a wallet we left on the chair.  We appreciate that as much as the pizza they served.  Thanks again.  While I ate my pizza I also saw other people either in a car outside or doing takeouts enjoying their visits there; everything seemed to be happening smoothly and pleasantly. Clementine 80 in Mississauga or Brampton...."}
{"text":"Great Pizza! Always Fresh and delivious"}
{"text":"I have been a regular at this location for many years. The customer service is excellent as staff are always very pleasant to me.  Most importantly, the quality of pizza and ingredients overall have been fresh and delicious every time I have ordered delivery or visited in store.   I am a very healthy eater and never feel like I am cheating on my diet when I go to Pizza Nova, this is for the reason of their accommodation when I ask for thin, whole grain crust, loaded with vegetables and protein toppings.   I prefer Pizza Nova over any other pizza restaurant for the reason that Pizza Nova has additionally invested in the nutritional analysis of their menu items. I recently discovered that only at Pizza Nova their pepperoni is sourced from Canadian-raised animals without antibiotics or hormones. I definitely recommend this location for pickup, delivery, or just dropping by for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Wait time is about 15 minutes for a full pizza so you can preorder online or by phoning ahead. They have pick up specials too!  There are a few stools where can eat and a couple of small tables inside.  When the weather is warmer, they'll have about 3 tables and 12 chairs for outdoor eating although you are beside Yonge Street so hopefully that just becomes white noise for you.  One thing I like about Pizza Nova is the bacon topping looks like cut bacon strips and not like it was a bacon sausage removed from the casing.  A popular place for quick meals south of Sheppard and on the eastside of Yonge."}
{"text":"Very clean place with great vegetarian pizza. The store looks neat and organized. So glad Pizza Nova carries Daiya vegan dairy-free cheese now."}
{"text":"Solid choice for a late night bite.  Was relatively clean and I would come back if I am in this hood again.  I liked how they had various products for sale, such as canned tomatoes, hot peppers, and olives. Convenient if you need to grab a few items or have to grab a host/hostess gift on the go!"}
{"text":"Have stopped in a couple of times now while in the area and enjoyed a decent veggie slice as this is close to my work.  I always add green olives (they are my fave) to my pizza. Perhaps odd to some but for me, pizza just isn't the same without olives.  Like how they offer various toppings to sprinkle on your pizza on the counter (dried herbs, chili oil, red pepper flakes, etc).  Also have picked up a couple of their ready to go foodstuffs (spicy olives and hot peppers) and have really enjoyed!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Polini chicken with Honey garlic sauce and paid for Hot Sauce on the side.  I brought the box back to my office and realized they gave me tomato sauce. Ugh!  As vexing as that is, it's not the reason for the review.  I tried calling them to get restitution for tomorrow but it went to the switchboard.  I asked the customer service chick for the store number and she said, \"There's NO WAY to get in touch with them.\"  I told her why I was calling and she was EXTREMELY snooty about it, \"so you're calling JUST because they forgot to give you EXTRA sauce?\" I could feel her stupid eyes rolling. Then she put me on hold and ate up all my day time minutes!! Now I'm out another few bucks!  When she got back on the line she said, \"they'll expect you tomorrow.\"  What? OH will they now?!?! I was like, \"Didn't you say there was no number to reach them?\" Then she said \"OBVIOUSLY there is, YOU just don't have access to it.\" Her sass levels were off the charts!  Never have I wanted to reach through a phone and upper cut someone so badly.   Oh, also the chicken chunks were large but then some of them were ridiculously small. I know shapes will vary but not THIS drastically.  And it barely even matters cuz the polini was 50% breaded batter, 30% chicken breast and 20% stupid."}
{"text":"I'll admit I'm a Pizza Nova fan but this location by far makes the best pizzas and has the best variety of slices. They're very consistent.   This particular location is very neat and the staff is helpful. Also, their delivery times are quick and unlike other pizza places, your pizza actually arrives hot."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza. Got my order wrong. Delivered wrong drinks. Too expensive for quality of food."}
{"text":"We ordered the Josh Donaldson's Pick for delivery.  It was delivered in less than 25 minutes.  It was a bit more spicy than we imagined.  Yes, their claim that their Italian style hot peppers are small but mighty, which add zest and heat!  They certainly are right about that.  Get your fire extinguishers ready.  No wonder Josh can catch any hit from anywhere after eating this pizza because his ass is on fire.  The chicken pollini was quite delicious, and it helped to sooth the heat from Josh."}
{"text":"When you've been to one pizza nova, you've been to all of them, the wall of tomatoe cans, the chrome display case and the uncomfortable stools at the front windows. Food is the same, its great pizza, when you have no were else to go, chicken wings are flavourful and meaty, great place for \"oh no, we forgot to make dinner!\" save. However, this place, a cook dropped his peel on the ground, then proceed to put it back on top of the oven, luckily a manager saw that I saw and told him to go clean it, makes you wonder, how well they actually clean the kitchen."}
{"text":"Pizza was just okay, wings were burnt and the salad - well I didn't expect much from the salad anyway.  We ordered to share with four people. We got the 'Super Gourmet' pizza, 20 roasted Italian wings, and balsamic Mediterranean salad.  To begin, they are a pizza place, so it is reasonable that the pizza was the best part, but that wasn't a big achievement in this case. So that was an okay pizza though it was a bit slim on the toppings.  Anyway, the biggest problem that made me want to write this review was the quality of the wings. The spices could have been nice, but they did not cover the burnt flavour. The wings were very black and burnt. We like well done wings, but we didn't even ask for well done - they just came burnt!  Oh yeah, the salad, I didn't expect much from it so it isn't even worth mentioning except that it will definitely not exceed anyone's expectations.  I've had good pizza from another location from Pizza Nova, so I was severely disappointed tonight with these results."}
{"text":"Love Pizza Nova pizza.  Good variety of pizzas to choose from.  Their tomato sauce makes it taste so good.  My go to Pizza place is always Pizza Nova.  They are delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered on my mobile app. When we got there, we paid and saw our pizza come out of the oven. Waited 5 minutes before the guy behind the counter got around to give us our pizza that was clearly sitting on top of the oven. He was busy cleaning he said."}
{"text":"I just had the worst pizza I have ever had from the Glen Erin and Britannia location. It was burnt. The cheese was non existent. It arrived stone cold. They must have lots of customers because they don't seem to care. Now they have one less customer.  See yah."}
{"text":"Asked for Fried panzo,  received a Baked one. Called customer service and got told there are only 2 locations that do Fried. Well shouldn't of the staff told me that when I specifically asked for fried!?  Order a pepperoni pizza. Get it home. It's mush and soggy undercooked dough. Come one Pizza Nova! You were once my go to number 1 pizza joint. No longer."}
{"text":"This Pizza Nova location has been the provider for our company functions for the last four years and even when I'm ordering 25 party size pizzas, they are always delivered fresh, piping hot and on time!  We typically order a wide variety so that there is something for everyone no matter what their dietary preferences are... they even have gluten free (but it's only available in a medium size).  Unfortunately, I don't know the delivery man's name but we always get the same gentleman and his customer service is outstanding!  Whenever I'm having a company function, small or large, I know this Pizza Nova location can always deliver (no pun intended... or maybe it was)!  :)"}
{"text":"Okay, they're making their way up the scale. I popped in here the other night to grab a quick pizza before an event that a coworker and I were going to. They had deal on for a medium (8 slices... albeit, small slices) pepperoni pizza for $7.99!  Now I'm not typically a 'pepperoni' pizza kinda gal but I am all over a cheap dinner on the run. After taxes we were looking at $4.50 each! I'm in!  We ordered (and paid) in the afternoon so I was in and out within seconds at pick-up time. Fantastic!  Thankfully, I didn't have the same experience with this pizza as I did with the last so perhaps it was my previous selection. This one was light, bubbly and delicious and at that price, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Standard Pizza Nova, meaning my go-to spot for chain pizza.  Consistent quality, fast service, no issues.  Had a slice of Canadian - all good.  But the best part was listening to the guys in line after me (while waiting for my slice to heat up) asking if in the future they can call ahead to order their pizza instead of ordering it there and waiting for them to make it.  Um, yes - yes you can.  They hadn't heard of being able to call in - what? Lol ok maybe they're new, still - it was entertaining and a good way to pad a review for which I really don't have much more to add otherwise."}
{"text":"Daughter's birthday. 9 teenage girls plus our family of 4 more. Bought 2 party deal pizzas. Great crust, cheese, and sauce. A prototypical pizza.   Mrs. says the place was spotless and service impeccable. She was so impressed she insisted I write this review. New to town, but we've found our go-to pizza place."}
{"text":"Friendly and helpful owner operator.  The pizza is good.  Recommend they get  fountain drinks.  We like to dine in a feel we are getting nicked and dimmed with the cans of soda."}
{"text":"This place is alright. A much better option than the other chains in the area. The guys working there are friendly enough. I don't love the crowd that hangs out in the parking lot weekend nights but overall the place is A-OK."}
{"text":"Best pepperoni walk in special. 8.99 for a medium and only takes 10-15 minutes. Great crust and just a bit greasy from the cheese and pepperoni. But in a good way. Eat fresh from oven!"}
{"text":"It's ok for fast food pizza. Recommend to order a whole pizza not buy the slices; definitely not as good since it's been sitting around and they'll just warm it up a little before giving it you.   Thin crust pizza comes out fast with crisp edges. If you look at the pepperoni slices they're a little anemic looking. I personally prefer my pepperoni cooked longer so the edges will crisp up and have nice color: maybe it's the kind of pepperoni they use.  They have a condiment table with extra virgin olive oil from Italy, basil, pepper flakes, garlic (looks granulated), salt and even Sriracha but no parmesan cheese..  Popular with the locals; my friend grew up on Pizza Nova."}
{"text":"For a pizza chain, Pizza Nova stands out from its competition as being the best IMHO. It is clear that the company is headed by an Italian with an interest in preserving a home style quality on a mass scale.   The chicken wings are better than most pizzeria wings. The veal sandwich, lasagna, and panzerotti are downright delicious. And the pizza is fresh and consistent from location to location with few exceptions.   Singularly, I'd have to say the key ingredient to all of these favorites that sets them apart is their tomato sauce. While certainly not made fresh in each store, as far as I can gather, it's about as close as you can get to homemade without doing so. Rich, perfectly seasoned, with a solid consistency of tomato throughout.   Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE Pizza Nova but despite this location being situated in the same complex as our office, we never ordered from here. The sandwiches are good and it may be good for a slice here and there, but the pizzas tend to be undercooked and doughy even when ordering thin crust and well done. It's happened more than once and just turned us off."}
{"text":"As a celiac sufferer who needs to be gluten free this place was wonderful. Their gluten free standards are quite good and I did not get sick from cross contamination which is always a win. Very quick delivery and the pizza was hot. Will be ordering again!!"}
{"text":"Excellence in pizza . Clean hygienic place, friendly staff n great quality pizzas . Service is xtremly quick"}
{"text":"stellar service from a 2 man team servicing a steady stream of hungry 9-5ers. Was lucky enough to taste the primavera slice today and the gourmet!! Got the gourmet well baked as requested and the primavera was just as good as it looked with spinach and loaded with veggies. nice sit down area with several tables and people-watching stools... free wifi bebe!"}
{"text":"I order from Pizza Nova all the time from work at Keele and Finch and the pizza is amazing but I ordered pizza from this location on the Danforth from my house and it was the worst pizza I have had ever. The pizza was uncooked and this caused all the toppings to slide off the pizza if I wasn't so busy I would have took it back,  I ended up eating it later after cooking it myself. I will never order Pizza from here again.  I walked in and ordered the pizza,  no rush just make it right,  they failed."}
{"text":"Not impress by the service received. Place an order online and pizza showed up late wasn't on time and we didn't get it free. Customer service wasn't helpful. Never ordering Pizza Nova again...."}
{"text":"This Pizza Nova is much better than the rest of the franchises'. Even from the outside you can tell. They have a cool new interior (I'm speaking relative to other pizza nova's and pizza take out places) and the smell of the pizza's can be smelt from the outside.  They have a lot of fresh slices of different varieties and depending on their slices they LOAD up on the toppings (especially their Bruschetta slice, it had a mountain of tomatoes on it!). I like what they've done with this store and also glad they actually serve decent pizza that doesn't soak through the paper holder.  They apparantly have ribs and pasta and wings too but I haven't and probably won't try it from them - I'd rather have my $20 ribs at a restaurant."}
{"text":"The pizza was tasty , I added extra toppings on the chicken polo and we enjoyed the base and the tomatoes taste . We will order again .."}
{"text":"A small Pizza Nova location with almost no seating. The pizza is fresh, the staff is friendly. The gluten-free dough needs some work, but this of course is a problem Pizza Nova-wide. The location is handy for those who lives in the Avondale condo complex."}
{"text":"I've gone to this location several times mainly due to convenience.  Today however, I noticed the guy making the pizza was eating and licking his fingers and making someone's pizza at the same time.  This was after I was just standing around at the front counter (empty) for a good 2-3 minutes just being ignored.  Needless to say I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Lots of good, fresh toppings. Will definitely order from here again. One thing to mention for improvement is the customer service on the phone; took forever for them to figure out if they deliver to us, and transferred me to customer service, etc. Aside from that, a delicious experience."}
{"text":"This pizza place is so mediocre, would not recommend. Their ingredients somehow didn't taste like much of anything, there was an overall bland taste. Maybe salty but that's about it. Possibly not fresh ingredients or underbaked because the aroma and flavours of the ingredients didn't come through at all. The cheese and toppings were detached from the sauce/crust. Only redeeming part is that it's cheap."}
{"text":"Close to my house so I go here once and a while.  Slices have usually been sitting around but for a whole pizza they're pretty decent"}
{"text":"The Asian guy who served me and my girlfriend seemed pissed off and not willing to actually take out order. Here's the scenario; me: \"hello how are you?\" Asian guy: \"what do you want?\". Neff said. Don't come here."}
{"text":"In the land of gourmet D.O.P pizza in Toronto you may ask, why order delivery? Well sometimes you just want a good ol' traditional delivery pizza on a Friday night. And that's exactly why I wanted when I ordered a pizza from this pizza Nova location.  I didn't expect a fancy thin crust gourmet pizza. I grew up on Pizza Nova delivery so I knew what I was getting myself into. Or so I thought. What I got was completely not edible. It was overcooked to the extreme. The cheese was burnt, the crust was bone dry and there was a small pool of tomato coloured water and toppings in the centre of the pizza. Needless today it was thrown out after a slice."}
{"text":"Great location, excellent service, and great pizza. The parking lot is kinda small and crowded so during the busier times it's hard to find a parking spot but the location is perfect. The store is spacious and clean. There are always fresh pizzas and they're organized! The staff are super friendly and nice. I went during thats amour day and even tho the store was super busy with double lines out of the store, I was only in line for about 5-8 mins. They were organized and had everything prepared. Great to see how quick and organized they were. Pizza tasted amazing as well and usually the temperature of the slices are good but since they were giving out medium pizzas for a cheaper price they made pizzas before so it wasn't has fresh or warm as I wanted. But totally understandable."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza. I forgot why I don't order from there, so I did, and  now I remember ; the cheese doesn't stick to the pizza...had to eat the cheese and crust separately. Also, the potato wedges were hard inside, which usually mean raw. Never a again."}
{"text":"I had the soppresatto and spicy salami and the crust was great but toppings didnt taste fresh at all. I also had a vegetarian slice and the whole wheat crust tasted like cardboard and toppings werent fresh tasting... Overall wlddnt come back despite the convenient location and friendly staff. Sooo many better pizza places before this one. Even pizza pizza up the road beats this place hands down!"}
{"text":"This'll be a short review as its a pizza take out counter, but despite Pizza Nova not being my favorite pizza place this one exceeded expectations.  The staff has been the same each time I've been and is extremely friendly. Guy at the counter calls everyone sir and is helpful with any questions about products the customer has.  The pizza is actually tasty and reasonably priced, there's lots of seating, it's clean and there's even a TV to watch while eating your meal.  Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I like Pizza Nova, but this location from my one time there was not worth going back to.   Had just had a great date and was in a great mood but it was drinks only, so I was hungry. Went in and ordered a large walk-in. Guy at the counter looks like he is against any sort of expression. Barely acknowledges he's talking to a person. Doesn't say one word until muttering \"15 minutes\". Then goes to talk to his buddy in the back of the restaurant where he starts laughing and whooping it up with him until the next customer comes in where he barely speaks to her either (and she was with her son, both were very polite). Pizza's done, he puts it in the box and drops it on the counter and walks away without saying anything.   Terrible service. Pizza was fine, thus the two stars, but that's it. I'll go to Pizza Hut instead"}
{"text":"Much better than Pizza Pizza. I also like Little Caesar's (they have a free app) and ask them to prepare the pie with one-half the dough to yield a thin crust pizza. Little Caesar's have the best prices, I think."}
{"text":"we ordered a party pizza for work lunch around 11:30am. we were advised it will take about 45 mins. so we waited we waited, until 11:45am, we called back to check, and being advised they are on the way. so finally one of the team members had to go to start their afternoon appointments without even having lunch. and the pizza arrived at 1:06pm, bottom BURNT. the location is 6 mins away from our condo, what took them so long to deliver a pizza, and it was burnt. we checked the reviews from other customers before, it is not the first time they provide poor quality burnt food. luckily when we called back customer service, the lady was vey helpful, to provide the same worth of food for free on our next order. but still, I'd say avoid this location. just poor quality..."}
{"text":"Heading home from the ballet, I was in the mood for some pizza. Pizza Nova is a personal favourite of mine so thought I'd stop here for a quick bite.   Ordered a slice of cheese pizza. It was 11pm.   The slice was served cold and I only realized this when I drove off so didn't have the chance to ask for it to be warmed up more.   Based on this experience I wouldn't go back here. Also, this is a tiny location compared to the rest of their locations."}
{"text":"I always order online and they they get my order right every time. However, I've noticed that my experience depends on what time of the day I go there for my pickups. During the day time, my pizza is made perfectly - its cut neatly, all my toppings are there, never burnt or sloppy. The staff is always incredibly nice- not rude at all, they even remember me when I come in. In the evening- coming in sucks! The pizza isn't perfect anymore... the toppings are there, but they're all sloppy. The pizza itself isn't cut properly - you have to tear the slices and end up pulling off toppings from the neighbouring slices. My special instructions (easy on the sauce) gets met with no sauce on %75 percent of the pizza. The staff isn't so pleasant either... its not like they're rude or anything, just not as helpful or as friendly.  Overall the food is good, even when it is ordered at night. Other reviews seem to write about how they got sick... it's a pizza place! Fast food ? Eat too much and you'll get sick. That would happen in McDonalds, BK, Pizza Pizza, any fast food place ! This is not a \"fine dining\" experience.  For the price of the walk in special, the food is good. My pepperoni is always crisp and delicious , my dough is soft and chewy with crispy edges, and, my cheese is generously sprinkled all over and perfectly melted :D Been going here for two years and I've never been sick yet- just wish night shift would step it up a little bit !"}
{"text":"My absolute favourite pizza in the area. So yummy. Location is neat. Service is good and always delivers on time. Price is also reasonable. Have tried a variety of pizza types over the months, and enjoyed them all. I am especially fond of the pizza source and feta cheese they use."}
{"text":"Got my pizza twice here and both were burnt. I called customer service and they sent out another order to the same location for me to pick up for free of charge and when my boyfriend got there the worker demanded him to pay.. we had to wait for them to call customer service for them to tell the worker that it is free and to give it to him with no charge. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Convenient location for those who live in the areas plentiful high rise condos. Pizza nova pizza is pretty much the same at all location, but this one has a great staff. I've been to pizza joints practically run by burn outs and high school kids, but this place has people who take their job seriously.   They always have a good variety of slices too, even at night."}
{"text":"Always quick for my orders when I come here and friendly staff as well. My preferred Pizza Nova location."}
{"text":"Not the usual location I go to but I may have to start coming here more often.  Great staff and attitude every time I come here and the way the pizza tastes here is better than other locations. I don't know why but it just does!"}
{"text":"We felt like Italian food for lunch and were pleasantly surprised that this location had relatively okay dine in seating, so we ate in the store.  We ordered a Meatball Panouzzo and a Porchetta Panouzzo.  The Meatball Panouzzo was very saucy.  It came with 2 meatballs in slices.  It tasted like a meatball and spicy tomato sandwich.  It was a little sloppy eating the sandwich because the meatballs fell out sometimes.  The Porchetta Panouzzo had some marinated shredded pork.  We somehow could not remember what the pork tasted like (it was not BBQ flavoured), so I guessed the flavour wasn't very memorable.  It was not a saucy sandwich, so it was less messy to eat.  I guess the food here is average Pizza Nova food.  The seating is quite nice, though.  The seating area is clean.  There are 3 round tables, each can seat 4, and a long bar table and a few bar stools.   There are clean washrooms."}
{"text":"You get the food, eventually... the customer service is complete trash, i ordered 2 pizzas averaging 60 bucks, and they look and taste about 5 bucks, sure i tried it but if any of yiu want to, i dont understand why you would.."}
{"text":"It should be Pizza? No! Not Pizza Nova. This tastes like an ok frozen pizza.  Actually that's being quite polite as frozen pizza is way less expensive and you know to lower your expectations."}
{"text":"Convenient location across the street from our house. Staff are very friendly and quick at placing your order. My daughter and I ordered two pizza slices, a Hawaiian and s traditional. The slices were freshly made with a thin, crispy crust and teeming with toppings. The Hawaiian was loaded with fresh pineapple, ham and the chewiest, gooiest cheese. Exceptionally tasty, hot and, in terms of portion, quite reasonable. The traditional was loaded with pepperoni, green peppers, mushrooms, chewy cheese and the best marinara sauce I've ever had on pizza. We ate inside. There's plenty of seating and is very clean. Would highly recommend this store for s quick bite or a family pizza night. Pick up or delivery, the choice is yours!!!"}
{"text":"Never order from them! I ordered a pizza. They gave me a time of 30-40 minutes, but my pizza never came! that's never happened to me ordering take out. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Just dont do pizza nova delivery! wrong pizza toppings, plus hair in the pizza. called customer service and got a refund."}
{"text":"Please do not order the ribs.  What is described as a rack of ribs is actually 9 tiny ribs that look like it came from a fetal pig. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I've been in here a few times after I ordered my order online, then picked it up. It was ready once I got there - no waiting. The pizza isn't too doughy and the ingredients taste fresh. I love the fact that the meat is sourced from a company that does not use hormones or antibiotics - I think Pizza Nova is the only chain pizza place to offer this.  The only problem was, I had just had surgery so I was a bit out of it, thankfully someone else was with me and was able to order, however, the guy at that visit got annoyed because I didn't know one could get more ingredients than the typical cheese, pepperoni and sauce. It was an odd thing to get annoyed about, and it was rather embarrassing given my situation. But, the other times I was there the customer service was just fine."}
{"text":"This location is hit or miss.  I've had some good pizza here, and I've had some burned pizza here.  But, to be fair - lately it has been good.    Fifteen minutes from order to table for a large pepperoni pizza for only 10.99?  That's not a bad thing any way you look at it.    But let us be honest about their dipping sauces.  This is not the pizza chain that knows how to do a dipping sauce.  Their garlic sauce tastes more like Ranchers Choice dressing.  If that's what you're into, awesome.  But at the 0.85 price point, that's too high for discount salad dressing.  But the pizza?  That's still a tasty treat."}
{"text":"Service was bad enough that I asked for a refund and left without getting pizza. The employee didn't seem to care, was not clear about price, and shortchanged me when refunding me. Go to Pizza Pizza across the street for better service and much better value."}
{"text":"I'm so surprised at some of the bad reviews here.  I order my pizza from here almost every Friday because I don't have time to cook that night.  The staff is amazing, they remember my kids, alter orders last minute, throw an extra dipping sauce in every now again even a bag a chips for my son if it's slow and we have to wait 20 min.   Then the pizza is delicious, panzo is amazing and even the wings! It beats Pizza Pizza, Pizza Hut, Little Ceasars (cardboard), Dominos, 241, Pizzaville! That's exactly who they're supposed to beat. I've had Pizza Nova that isn't as good as this location but Yelp is based on location not Corporation.   Deserves a 5 stars for being the best in its category (corporate pizza store)"}
{"text":"My favourite of all the fast food pizza places in the city. Prices are good, delivery has always been fast. Obviously it doesn't compare to a stone oven pizza or anything, but for the convenience and price, it's great. No complaints here."}
{"text":"I made a Yelp account specifically to comment on this place. I just ordered a slice of pizza here, and they literally had over 100,000 midge flies lying alive and dead all over their counter, on the floor, in the pizza window, everywhere. They were well aware of the obvious problem, were pretending not to notice it, and for some reason did not clean any of the alive flies off any of the surfaces. There were about 7 people working at the time.  I picked three flies out of my single piece of pizza. They should have been closed to deal with the infestation--instead, they were making pizzas and delivering them to your place. Embarrassing. Makes me wonder what else is going on at this place. Wow."}
{"text":"New unit, expanded in the same plaza.  Same owner, he's friendly and makes a good pizza.  I got the basic walk in special for the kids, and one with four toppings for adults.   Price same as all the chain pizzerias, Taste is good, and crust tasty.       (my opinion it beats the pizzapizza competitor)   The plaza has crummy entrance from Weston Road, Orly has access going south.     on thé PLUS+ side they have great delivery driver.  He's fast, and polite."}
{"text":"If I could give a no star rating I would. I have been here three times now and I have always been highly disappointed with the quality of the food and the service. I always try a place three times before giving up on it and today is the third time and there won't be a fourth. I ordered on phone twenty minutes before coming and and they gave me a twenty minute time span so I drove over. When I got to the restaurant they said they just got my order...... So now I have to wait another half hour .. Fifty minutes in total for a small pizza I called in for. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Fresh made, these guys know pizza.  Crust is never \"doughy\" and they dont skimp on toppings. You can taste the quality products they use and there is amazing variety of toppings! Love the pesto and non- tomato saucy options!  But don't misunderstand, their traditional cheese/pepperoni is yummy too!  Even their gluten-free crust is good (and if you have been looking for gluten free crust you know how hard it is to find one that doesn't taste like cardboard).    Been in the area a long time, and tried a lot of pizza joints... This is are go-to pizza place of choice!"}
{"text":"This is the best delivery pizza in the area. If you live right at YandS your pizza will most likely be at your door in less than 30 mins, which is great! They have this option of getting your pizza well done, which I didnt even know existed but it awesome. The cheese is a little crispy and so are the toppings."}
{"text":"Very bad wings and salty pizza. I just went here, and ordered 20 wings with pizza. But they were both shit. Don't go to this location."}
{"text":"This is mainly a review for pizza Nova cust. Serv. The lady was so nice to me when I fumbled around and voice all garbled up. Perfect estimation when order would be ready. By the way, this Pizza joint is the best comm chain in to. Sandwiches, food excellent!"}
{"text":"Clean shop. The cashier is efficient. I ordered my pizza slice to-go. It got cold very quickly unfortunately. I ate it less than two minutes after leaving the establishment. It tasted good, but I was a bit bummed because it would have been a lot better warmer."}
{"text":"Love these guys here!  They are fast, friendly and even gave this drunk girl a free pop.....now that's customer service :)  Hadns down it's the best pizza joint in the hood....unless you like paying $15+ for a gourmet pizza down the street....but for $9.02 you can get a medium 1 topping walk in in under 15 mins!  That's 8 slices of fresh, hot and quality pizza.  I 100% agree with Chris P...way WAY better then Pizza Pizza."}
{"text":"I can only assume my order came from here: ordered online, and this place is a 3 min walk from here.  Anyway, giving it 3 stars: - 4 stars for delivery service: It was fast, probably about 30 mins after ordering online it was delivered and the way as expected. - 2 stars for the quality and value: Ordered a thin crust whole wheat pizza and it was just \"meh\", and quite greasy. And especially considering the price for a \"3 ingredient\" specialty pizza, it was way below par."}
{"text":"Decent quality pizza at a reasonable price. Definitely the best franchise pizza on this corner. I usually get the medium pepperoni thin crust walk-in for $8.99 and it's satisfying. I especially like their pepperoni."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Got 2 pizzas to go , one with pepperoni the other with sausage and red peppers. Got home notice the little kid with braces at cashier ordered onion and red peppers. Child ! Not everyone is Muslim and don't eat pork. Stop assuming. But the funny thing about this location is he didn't punch it into machine did the calculations on a calculator. Fraud I guess ? Not reporting income ? Who knows. So I didn't get a receipt."}
{"text":"Very Good pizza for a chain. Fresh and crisp crust. Very nice owner."}
{"text":"I ordered a meatball sub and found it really bland, and the sauce is not very good.  The pizza is also kinda salty, i guess to make up for the sauce.  Free 2nd pizza is probably a better bet in the next door plaza."}
{"text":"The best place to get pizza.  No questions about it.  It's gourmet and looks appealing and tastes even better.  Not super greasy like other pizza.  Trust me it's worth it"}
{"text":"These chain restaurants get no love from yelp so I decided to do my duty and write a review of this particular location. First off, I love Pizza Nova in general: much better tasting pizza than the equally ubiquitous Pizza Pizza or Domino's. So faced with a 40 min drive home, a craving for pizza, and a hunger wavering on the brink of 'hangry', I made the decision to look up closest pizza joints and stick with what I know. Pizza would be perfect, I reasoned, to eat comfortably while driving and immediately soothe those intrusive hunger pangs, while giving me the added bonus of having lunch sorted out for the next day. This location was clean, empty for 930pm, and service was decent. I ordered my medium deluxe pizza and yolo'd a side of cheesy garlic bread. I was THAT hungry. Getting into my car and before doing anything else, I immediately cracked open the garlic bread and was impressed by it's massive cheese pull. So far so good. Now on the road, I opened the pizza box to dive into a much anticipated slice. To my dismay, the pizza was SOGGY! The entire slice basically fell apart with toppings falling everywhere. I was so upset. It was obvious something technically disastrous had happened during the construction of this pizza. Crust is not supposed to be wet and basically disintegrate like tissue paper. And it was maybe 5 minutes after the pizza was delivered into my eager hands too, so it wasn't sitting around for any appreciable time to get soggy. Nevertheless, I was so hungry that I rolled up the slices like a burrito and consumed it that way, which made it a far more messy drive home than I wanted. At home, I decided to reheat the pizza in the oven and inspect it further to figure out what the hell happened. And that's when I found my answer: The centre of the pizza was stretched too thin! The paper thin crust in the middle couldn't hold up against the weight of the toppings on top, so soaked through. So in conclusion, this location needs to be aware of how it's making it's pizza. Pizza mechanics is just as important as delivering a tasty product!"}
{"text":"As good as any other pizza Nova, definitely one of the best pizza chains out there. No pizza nova ever gives me enough cheese, not just this location, it's a pizza nova wide crisis. So they get just 4 stars.   Inside has a bar sitting table, a large table for several people and a personal 2 person table. Also free wifi while you wait for your pizza, or eat there, they also serve beer.  Bone petito."}
{"text":"Surprisingly not bad! Convenient location, ample parking.  The food is good and the turnaround time is decent (I have to admit that I was there on Sunday afternoon and not sure of how it is on a weekday). One area where it could be improved is more detailed menu, you almost have to read the printed menu  before ordering."}
{"text":"I've had better, but as far as chain pizza places go this one is top notch. Clean and decent amount of seating. An $8 pick up special that just can't be beat in a pinch."}
{"text":"Worst location. Poor slice selection for walk-ins. There weren't any cheese, pepperoni or veggie slices during peak after school hours. Told it would take at least 15 minutes to make them. Mediocre customer service. No one cares if your kids are disappointed about not getting the pizza they thought they would get. Every other Pizza Nova location we visit always has basic cheese and pepperoni ready to serve. Not sure what's going on with this place. We walked out in disbelief at how kids are treated and how pathetic the selection was. Customers who came in before and after us walked out with nothing too."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to watch a game and eat some great food, meet great people and just have s great time. This is www I can relax and enjoy myself"}
{"text":"Of the pizza chains, Pizza Nova is by far the best.  Every once in a while, I will get desperate and try a Pizza Pizza slice across the street, because Pizza Nova does not stay open as late... and I always regret it.  The only complaint I have ever had at Pizza Nova is the new chicken pollini... it is supposed to be their boneless chicken wings, but they are the worst kind of frozen chicken nuggets drowning in wing sauce.  Blech!    Call in your order, pick it up and a large pepperoni pizza is made, fresh, fast and at a great price...  especially good when you get it on a thin crust."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Went in with kids as we were in the neighbourhood and ordered to go.  While waiting for our order my 3 yr old needed to use the bathrm.  Asked the man behind the counter and he said no bathrm service and then proceeded to talk to someone out of view.  That person I presumed came to the counter apologized and said the bathroom is for staff only and that the supervisor is here so they cannot allow use of the bathrm not even to paying customers and that I could go a few doors down to ask Subway.    I was absolutely shocked and horrified.  I said \"really you cannot allow a 3 yr old to use the bathrm?\"  They repeated the answer \"no\".  I didn't bother to contest as I didn't know how long my son could hold it in, we high tailed over to Subway and had to buy a sandwich for permission to use their bathrm.  Needless to say I was not impressed with their mediocre food laden with salt and terrible service.  They can clearly see I had 4 young children with me and not a flinch of human decency displayed to us, paying customers.  I can understand their fear of non customers trashing the place but seriously it was ridiculous. Not impressed with their lack of better judgement definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Just not sure what has happend to Pizza Nova. Used to be really good fresh pizza. Now it  just tastes like Pizza Pizza. I would say even worse."}
{"text":"I have been coming to the \"Meadowvale Pizza Nova\" in Mississauga for several years. Pizza here has been average at best  ( a little pricey compared to its competitors) but last week while in this neighborhood, I decided to stop by for a slice. Big mistake! It was around 2pm and the small Meadowvale location was not very busy and was staffed by two workers. I ordered a 'gourmet slice' with a soft drink which came to just over $5.00 with tax. After ordering the slice, the server (who was not very personable) quickly threw it in the oven. A few minutes later he took the slice out of the oven and quickly put it into the pizza box. When I got home I discovered the 'gourmet slice' was half burnt, and I could only eat less than half of hit. Obviously I was not going to drive back and return it, but that mistake just cost them a customer for life. A message to the owner of this chain...Domenic Primucchi, would you serve something to a customer that you would not eat yourself? I think not.  Domenic, if you are reading this, I would suggest you make it a company policy not to serve 'burnt' food. I understand your employees and franchise may get busy, but I would have rather waited a few more minutes to get 'a fresh slice of pizza' as opposed to something I could not eat. You seriously need to pay the \"Meadowvale location\" a visit."}
{"text":"Pizza that hits the spot for that junk food craving, but nothing particularly spectacular or gourmet about it. Our large pizza was half vegetarian (green peppers, mushrooms) and half not (chicken, roasted red peppers). The pizza pie was laden with toppings and definitely curbed our hunger; however the crust was thick and doughy and not particularly enjoyable. All in all, though, it was definitely a great 4 pm snack for a bunch of ravenous bridesmaids who'd skipped lunch and been up since 7 am for wedding hair/makeup/ceremony/photos."}
{"text":"Went in around 8pm, there was on guy in the back working and two people sitting right next to the counter. I'm looking at the guy at the back- nothing, looking at the guys sitting near the counter... nothing. I'm like huh? I'm here to buy pizza and no one is acknowledging that I'm standing there. Then the guy that doesn't look like he works there first called for the guy in the back but he didn't come out so he helped me take my order. This is was unbelievable - either they have toooooo much business and they don't need mine or they just have bad customer service. I'm was too shocked. I just wanted my pizza and leave but the lack of customer appreciation was shocking. I hope head office reads this!"}
{"text":"Pizza Nova is my first choice among the franchised pizza brands. Their sauce, crust, toppings - all really good. This location is SO cheap with their toppings! Sometimes i can only see 1 piece of mushroom or bacon per slice. Annoying & frustrating because if you say something, they are soooo rude! A few times the bottom of the pizza was burnt too. We stopped getting take out from them. It was convenient for me on my way home from work. Not going back."}
{"text":"I grabbed a slice during lunch and though this particular place isn't as good as the one near my house, I feel Pizza Nova overall is the best large pizza chain out there.  The slice was relatively fresh and the toppings was decent. The pizza probably could have been cooked longer or at a higher temperature. The pizza was a bit light on the veggie toppings and a bit too heavy handed on the cheese for my taste. I prefer the opposite. The sauce wasn't ground breaking but it wasn't watery, acidic, or overly sweet.  It's fast, convenient, and fresh... It's makes for a decent lunch."}
{"text":"** 3.5 stars **  As far as fast food goes, pizza is usually done poorly.  Thick bread and rock hard with minimal flavours with canned toppings.  This particular Pizza Nova does buck that trend.  I find Pizza Nova overall fresh with their toppings and fairly generous.  This store does not disappoint.  The pizza here is customizable on many ways... whole wheat, gluten free, thin crust, thicker crust, well done, or just medium done.  This is before any topping is placed on the pizza.  There are lots of sauce options (bbq, tomato, bruschetta, white garlic, pesto...) and even more toppings that are not the norm.  They have options such as portabello mushrooms and artichokes.    I always find them delivering exactly on time and always piping hot.  The toppings are plentiful and never ugly pale canned texture or look.  It is more expensive than other places but you do taste the difference.  The tomato sauce is not the best but it at least taste like tomatos compared to all the other overly sweet sauces (Pizza hut is guilty of this!).  So if I'm ever desperate for a decent pizza fast near work... this is the perfect place."}
{"text":"The worst experience at this location. The cashier was coincidentally the chef and handled a bunch of chanfe right before making my pizza! I was so disgusted and my husband confronted him to either refund my money or make a new one after he washed his hands (he was eating chips in the kitchen too). He laughed and denied everything stating he would not refund our money. Do not go here!!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in the neighbourhood. Dough isn't too thick and full of gluten and the sauce is perfect."}
{"text":"For a fast food pizza joint the slices are above par. The four star rating is based on it being fast food, not haute cuisine. It's certainly a million times better than Pizza Pizza, which is also close by. I can't fathom why anyone would eat at Pizza Pizza. It's not only the worst pizza in Toronto, but possibly the entire world."}
{"text":"I kind of like Pizza Nova! This location is under the CityPlace Matrix condos on Front Street West.  For a fast food pizza joint, I'm pretty impressed. Very spacious inside, extremely clean and great decor. They have quite a bit of seating, a large wall full of giant tomato cans and a nice flatscreen tv mounted on the far wall playing sports.  A slice + pop + chips is only $4.99. Bargain. If I ate more junk food I would be all over this. But they do list all their nutritional information online, which I appreciate.  So far I've tried a quattro staggioni slice, it was solid. They do a few kinds of pizza made with pesto (instead of tomato sauce). They also have gluten free and whole wheat pizza crusts and they will do thin or regular crusts. They have ribs, chicken wings, lasagna and salads too."}
{"text":"Ordered a simple pepperoni pizza and some dipping sauce. Tasted fresh and made me wonder why I even bother with other establishments. Very clean location with fast and friendly staff. Will be returning and definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Had ordered from this place 4 times. Each time I place an order for deluxe party size pizza. This place is not consistent in the way they do their pizza's. One thing they are consistent, making a terrible pizza. If you have to, go ahead and order...otherwise...save your hard earned cash to a pizza shop that can make a great pizza."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with service the last time. I ordered a slice of pizza and the guy made sure he finishes speaking yo his friend about NON work related stuff before he gets the slice and he continued speaking with his friend without making any eye contact with me. No thanks no please barely hello  I promised to myself not to ever go there again"}
{"text":"Pizza Nova is an Ontario-based pizza chain.  They provide a better selection than your typical pizza by the slice place.    My coworkers introduced me to it on Thursday.  I opted for a slice of the Portobello Mushrooms & Sopressata pizza slice, and it was decent.  The slices here are $4.99 pre-tax.  They also serve wings, but I have yet to try them.  This particular Pizza Nova doesn't have much seating."}
{"text":"Pizza and wings. Great combo.  Walk in specials for the win! Friendly and inviting staff."}
{"text":"I don't order pizza that much but my daughter in law likes Pizza Nova so I thought I'd give it a try.I ordered party size with 1/2 green pepper & 1/2 tomatoes. First, it was supposed to take 45 minutes,probably less, as it's near my home. But it took one hour. It was the worst pizza I had ever had. The bottom was burnt, there seemed very little cheese & it was doughy. It was very lukewarm & tasteless. Delivery charge was $3 even though I live close.It shouldn't be more than $2. The owner apologized. He said it was so busy as there was a basketball game that night. But that's no excuse for a poorly made pizza, cold & unappetizing. I won't be ordering from them again.We would have been better off with a McCain or Delissio."}
{"text":"Pretty standard as far as Pizza Nova's go.  The restaurant is clean and the staff were quick to get my order together.  Their pizza is waaaay better than PIzza Pizza across the street."}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy the the panzerroti at all.. it was boring and dull.. I did like the bread though.. it tasted like a pancake but I would never get this from here again.. I love Pizza Nova and for this location if they can't go right with this, imagine how the pizza taste? I will go to another Pizza Nova location before you catch me here again. Reason for the 3 stars was because of the pancake taste of the bread, besides that.. Nope."}
{"text":"I don't want my 2 star rating to disappoint totally. If you need Pizza, this place will satisfy--but that's it. This place reminds me of a joint I had back up in Sudbury called Topper's Pizza. Despite the small franchise's growth in to most of Ontario, it tries to offer new ideas with recipes and a house dip to die for, yet receives trash talk. Pizza Nova is the same, without any of the innovation which is worse. Their pizza is \"meh\", the prices aren't too cheap and their attempts to cater to the current generation of mobile devices is weak. HOWEVER! If you need a pizza, like, now.. It's not that bad."}
{"text":"Descent pizza . We orders wings and portobellissimo . The pizza was little burnt but still good . Wings were delicious . Fast delivery ."}
{"text":"Just around the corner from my house. I always pre-order the $9.99 large pizza Pick Up Special! Their pizza is so delicious and the guys who work there are VERY friendly!"}
{"text":"Nothing like a good pizza after moving into your new place!  This Pizza Nova made us a great pie to celebrate our move and enjoy a night in after a long day of unpacking.  Had tried Pizza Nova before, at the location close to Blood West Village, but wasn't really immpressed.  So far, this location has a fan and will definitely be returning for another.  Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Always good service, and a good slice of pizza. I've been coming to this location for a while, and I always get a good pizza."}
{"text":"Sometimes they rush it when they're not supposed to and the beauty of Pizza Nova is that they cook your food thoroughly but when you tell him then it's perfect"}
{"text":"The first thing you'll notice walking into this location is how sane the seating layout is compared with the Pizza Pizza across the street. A few round tables and some benches at a bar is simplicity itself contrasted with the labyrinth across the street.  Walking forward brings us to the counter, and thus the pizza itself. I've always had a weird thing with Pizza Nova - it's good, but the slices always seem smaller and more expensive than other pizza joints. I've never actually done a side-by-side scientific lab-coat-wearing comparison, but it's recurring observation for sure. I always leave feeling a bit ripped off.  Other than that: the staff is nice, the place is bright and *clean*. Spic and span. Only downside of this location in particular is that the table at the end makes you feel like you're on display for all who pass by on Front. Maybe avoid that one."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza and some variety too. Coming from ny I'm pretty picky but this was good enough for me.   There chicken is so great! I got the roasted Italian wings. Awesome.    I recommend it."}
{"text":"Super delicious pizza!  I ordered two large pies. One plain and one with pepperoni. Both were thin crust. I had them delivered to my hotel - Marriott City Centre.  It arrived fresh and hot within 35 mins after I placed the order.  I'm originally from NYC - so my review should carry some weight since we know pizza! ;)"}
{"text":"When you are in the mood for classic pizza, this is the place to go!  My family and I ordered a party sized pizza, and finished it in one night all by ourselves (there's only 4 of us), it was just that good.  I know it sounds crazy, like how good could pizza really be?  But it just perfectly hits the spot and, in my opinion, deserves a 5/5.  I hope everyone else has the great experience I did :) ."}
{"text":"Pizza nova has been around for a long time. And there is a reason for that excellent ingredients staff knows what they're doing. They serve a great product"}
{"text":"Pizza Nova is my go to for pizza from a franchise/chain joint.   Everytime I come to this location it's super clean. Not a crumb on the floor in the back prep area. Honestly, besides the great pizza it's the main reason I keep coming back.   Onto the pizza. So good. The crust and sauce are the most authentic you can find from a franchise pizza place. Blows pizza pizza out of the water.   They also have their 6 slices for $20.99 which makes family dinner that much easier. Great deal in my books."}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty decent after a few adult beverages, although a tad greasy. Would devour again."}
{"text":"I like Pizza Nova, saved me at dinner time many times. The large assorted pizza is a great option! The wings are good also, while you wait you can pick up desert from the middle eastern place next door, try the baclava :) ..."}
{"text":"Really good pizza! Love the deep fried panzerroti at some locations! For pizza their Portobello mushroom regular price and the soppressata italian sausage! Best price for pick up!"}
{"text":"I realize this is a chain but they make the best pizza.  I've been to the other \"gourmet' places and just like so many \"gourmet\" burger places, they always overdo it.  They try way to hard and forget that the simplicity of burgers or pizza is what makes them amazing. Pizza Nova understands this but you also have to order the right type of pizza.  3 toppings at the MOST, thin crust and always well done."}
