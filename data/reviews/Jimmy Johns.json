{"text":"This Jimmy John's opened and is a welcome addition to the area dining scene (if you want to call it that).  Broadview Heights is a food and dining wasteland.  Lots of cookie-cutter houses that cost way too much money, but no investment in some really good dining destinations...Hey they have a new McDonald's though!  At least Jimmy John's has super fast service, a friendly staff, and offers an alternative to the burgers and fries next store."}
{"text":"Happy to report they seemed to have some new blood in the store and things have gotten much better!"}
{"text":"I must be a masochist.  Stopped for the third time.  I thought the third time would be the charm.  Should have realized something wasn't quite right since every time I've stopped there, I am the only customer.  Chipotle next door is killing them.  Could be because Jimmy John's is carry-out only, unless you want to eat in your car.  And their ads don't say how great their subs are, only how fast they are.    The operation has improved a tiny bit, especially the register guy.  Bought two subs.  Guy who made them hands them to me.  I ask for a bag.  He hands me a bag.  So I guess this is Jimmy John's way of saving money by not bagging their subs.  I told the guy this was poor customer service.  He asked what I said.  I repeated my comment.  He said have a nice day.    I truly don't understand their rationale for not bagging subs for customers.  It's not like their subs are so great that people will come back again and again.  Well, okay I did.  But this was the last time.  I'm afraid the next I'll have to make our own subs.  Fool me three times.....LOL"}
{"text":"It's a Monday. It's lunchtime. Everyone's in a hurry. They were understaffed today, and despite that, the single employee working the register and sandwich line was quick, friendly, and sanitary. I frequent this location and have never had anything to complain about, and despite having setbacks today, they are still on top of it. Great job Broadview Heights Jimmy John's!"}
{"text":"Two visits recently and two mistakes. What don't you get when someone orders NO ONIONS! And, add HOT PEPPERS! At least at Subway you can watch your sandwich being made and catch any mistakes. Why do i have to tell you to put my sandwiches in a bag and throw in a few napkins? The warm bodies, ie staff, obviously don't give a damn about customer service. There are several other sub shops in the area who will be getting our business from now on. The owner/ manager at this location better wake up!"}
{"text":"Went in ordered was never asked what condiments vegetables type of bread nothing!  Just a plain sandwich was made. When I said I guess I don't get any thing on it he didn't offer to add anything just said \"they are good that way anyway\". My advice... go to Subway!!!"}
{"text":"Food is as good as any Jimmy Johns, but they don't deliver to eaton estate (literally 5 minutes down the road)."}
{"text":"Food was extremely tasty. Everything seemed fresh and the prices were ok. I had the veggie sub and I loved the avocado! Made fast. I only have 1 complaint. They won't deliver to my house and I only live 1.5 miles away... seems strange to have such a tiny delivery area. Also you can't pick cash as a option for online ordering."}
{"text":"Overall: Good cold lunch meat subs, but the service at this location is lacking and they don't deliver more than 2 miles.  Food: 3 stars.  I like the cold lunch meat subs, but they've had basically the same menu for 15 years.  They could use some innovation.  Service: 2 stars.  I've been in the location a few times, and the employees are constantly sitting at the table on their phones.  Also, I only live 2 miles (5 minutes) away but they won't deliver to me.  Location: 3 stars.  It's in the center of Macedonia, but the location is difficult to turn in and out of."}
{"text":"I have ordered quite a few times since they opened....fast, friendly, fresh still applies. Haven't had any mishaps, consistent!"}
{"text":"I placed an on line order for 24 jimmy minis at 7am for pick up at 6pm. Arrived around 6:15 and the order hadn't been started. They managed to make the order in about 10-15 minutes while I waited. They didn't know how to package the sandwiches in the box, I had to explain it because I've ordered these from other locations in the past. When they were almost finished with the order an employee came out from the back and the girl working on the order asked if he knew about it. He said yes and shrugged. It was clear he knew my order was needed for 6pm and chose not to make it.  Worst part was that when it was finished, they just handed me the box without any hint of an apology that it wasn't ready despite being ordered 11 hours in advance.  Not exactly freaky fast..."}
