{"text":"My wife and I have been to Gin Mill about 3 times, food was decent, but the bartenders and wait staff acted like they couldn't be bothered to serve my wife and me, they were too busy talking to the regulars at the bar.   And the owner (I assume) was there each time and didn't seem to notice or care how bad his staff SUCKS.  Last night we sat for around 15 minutes with no greeting or service.  We got up and left. Too bad, we like to go out for dinner and beers and tip extremely well.  I am pretty sure we will all see GIN MILL on BAR RESCUE.  That's the only way I plan to see this bar again.   To the owner: get off the bar stool and manage your business!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, for sports games and just to have a drink with friends. I've never been disappointed. The service is very good and the bartenders are friendly. The burgers are actually very good for bar food. The Miller specials are a bit of a downer, only because I prefer Bud. The TVs are located in great position to enjoy the games from the bar. For a local bar that doesn't have the feel of a big chain, this place is perfect. Side note: the homemade chips are delicious."}
{"text":"Been reading some of the reviews and I understand the 5 stars, I dont understand anything less than 5. I have been coming to this bar for 7 years after golf and I love it. The food is outstanding, and the barmaids, Gina, Stephanie, Kelly, Carmel are friendly and professional. The manger Carlos is a great guy and does a excellent job keeping things going. This is a wonderful neighborhood bar and everyone is made to feel welcome. Next time you stop in, tell them Golfer Joe sent you. :)"}
{"text":"Not a female friendly bar. Seriously lacking in customer service skills, a few of the female bartenders are just downright RUDE. The food is good, but sad the experience is ruined by unfriendly, unprofessional bar staff."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times now and have never had a bad experience. It's a great bar to hang out with friends at. They have a great selection of music, 2 pool tables and video poker machines. If you're in the area and looking for a place to grab a drink and kick it, I would recommend the Gin Mill."}
{"text":"My first experience with this bar has been less than stellar. I came here for lunch to grab a quick bite and food took forever. I was unimpressed by the bartenders lack of knowledge in the beers they serve. My buddy ordered a Heineken and got a Heineken light. The food was ok I had 2 sliders and fries and my buddy had 2 sliders as well just so happens another mishap my sliders come with no fries and my buddies does when he didnt order. The fact that they also do not have any beers on tap will be the main factor in me not returning again."}
{"text":"Bartenders were rude till I won some money playing a machine. Then they kissed my Ss because they wanted a tip. The woman who took my food order was smoking at the bar and then delivered my food. Place is dirty!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this Sunday's bartender less than one star. ....what a total ****.  Absolutely horrible"}
{"text":"Getting tires for my car over at Big O, they needed an hour, so I thought \"lemme check this dive, hopefully it'll be nice and dark and they'll have power for my laptop\" so I did.  Not only was it dark with an available power outlet, but the food was good! I didn't go in even thinking about lunch but I took a peek at the menu and I was impressed by its seriousness. I got the mushroom burger w onion rings to go with my Coke. Better quality meat than I expected, no gristle, 'shrooms sauteed just right, condiment carrier brought to my table.   Sports were playing on big TV's all over the place and regulars were enjoying a baseball game on ESPN. I got some work done while my car got new tires. Everything was copacetic."}
{"text":"Old school feel. Old school tunes. Friendly bartenders. A nice and comfy watering hole."}
{"text":"I love The Gin Mill! It is a friendly neighborhood bar without the pretentiousness of the \"dive\" bars, which is ironic in and of itself, but I digress.   The drinks are cheap (my 3 double Jameson/Ginger Ales and two shots of Jameson came out to $30). My 2 \"double\" Jameson/ginger ales..which I HIGHLY doubt were doubles, at Aces and Ales were $20. That is what sets a good neighborhood/low key bar from the pretentious hipster bars or the bars on the strip where you are aware of your impending rape.  The atmosphere is relaxed, people are singing the good ol boy songs. Some take it upon themselves to come by and introduce themselves. The bartender immediately came over to ensure that we were not being bothered. I really liked our bartender. She had a fun, spunky and real attitude. She even charged my phone for me! Her 30% tip was well deserved.   It is a smoky bar, they do serve food, they have a jukebox and pool tables. It does get rowdy, but the atmosphere overall was very relaxed with everyone just enjoying themselves."}
{"text":"This place feels like a neighborhood bar. Everyone seems welcome and the staff is very warm. There is a jukebox in the corner where everyone can spend their dollars fighting over the next genre to play. I had s burger and fries and for once in quite some time, it was actually cooked correctly.  If you want a good time and atmosphere on a weekend, this is the place to check out!"}
{"text":"Ok, yeah, there's nothing great about the Gin Mill.  It's a slightly below average bar with a slightly below average beer list and below average food.  However, I add a 3rd star for the following reasons: 1) I always hit two 4-of-a-kind every time I play here. 2) Drinking Liberally is here every Tuesday. 3) The servers are very nice. 4) Their potato chips are pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I went here to play pool. As we stood at the bar waiting for service the bartenders refused to help us. The woman behind the bar kept her back to us and cleaned and pretended like we were not there for 20 mins. While the one standing at the bar turned her back to us after she looked us up and down then walked off. It looked inviting when we walked into a open door but as we walked out a woman promptly closed it behind us. We ended up just going home after feeling so hated in our own area."}
{"text":"Best bartenders in town! Foods great your drink is never empty. Top notch! Shar is the best too great attitude and quick"}
{"text":"Was here for the first time the other night.  If your a smoker I guess its ok.  The cocktail service was great and quick.  I couldn't get out fast enough as I felt like i was in a volcano with all the smoke.   I suggest having people smoke outside or increase the airflow so someone like me can enjoy the bar.  My review would have been a 4 if the place was a white cloud of smoke."}
{"text":"Been here before... Wanted someplace sloce to the house so I thought I would stop in. The bar didn't have 2 seats together so we sat at a table. I guess that was my fault. NEVER asked if we wanted drinks. Mad eye contact with the waitress several times and she just helped other people. Ended up leaving and went to the Blind Tiger where we had a much better time."}
{"text":"This is a great place to 'drop into' and relax.  The bartenders (won't name them for their privacy) are awesome and welcome most with a greeting and smile.  The salads are great. The crowd is quiet yet also welcoming.  Just moved here, and this is now my \"go to\" place."}
{"text":"This bar is terrible! We took and paid for several shots of Jack Daniels at the bar. We thought they tasted funny so we watched the bartender pour them from a bottle to make sure we weren't getting well whiskey. When we brought it to her attention she said, \"oh maybe somebody put something else in this bottle\" like it was no big deal. She started pouring shots from a different bottle and they tasted like they should. I will never step foot in this place again"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. The burgers are huge, the pizza is tasty and the gyro salad is the best thing for your mouth.  The bartenders are super friendly. There's really nothing bad I can say about this bar.  It's strange that there's no draft beer. Everything is in bottles just so you're aware."}
{"text":"Greg is a great bartender works on graves and pays attention to details. He's constantly cleaning/pouring/serving drinks. He's quite a special bartender and what makes him so good is he will actually sit and listen to you and genuinely cares about your well being. This bar is a must visit if you are in the area. They have a great juke box and food as well.  Update, Greg no longer works for Gin Mills they have a grumpy old man that drinks whisky round the clock on grave yards and he's bitter and cold. damn place over charges for a bottle of beer they are charging upwards of 4 dollars which is 8 dollars for 24 ounces. Same time pts charges me 4 dollars a beer for a full 25 ounces of beer."}
{"text":"The food is good but takes for ever  the bartenders are so rude and so was the server I asked for ranch for my fries and she said is there anything else I don't want to go back and forth a bunch of times rude rude rude"}
{"text":"Can't speak highly of the bartender tonight. She's a thunder *UNT! There are better hole in the wall place than this place. Worse customer service!"}
{"text":"Great gaming bar but bad people around you as girl don't go there by yourself .. Hit a royal last month cool place other than a casino"}
{"text":"This place is filthy stinky nasty Sh\"t hole. Food was greasy and terrible. Not to mention the bartenders are thieves. I wouldn't go back here if it was the last bar in Vegas. Drugs are openly being sold here by staff almost pushed on you after 9pm. They over serve and almost for certain refill there liquor bottles with well booze. I wish I could give this place zero stars. Be smart and avoid this place. Place is full of low lives and drunks. Bathrooms were disgusting and looked like they haven't been cleaned ever. Plastic bags over urinals. Wow just wow!"}
{"text":"This place sucks... Bartender rather be texting on the phone than serving drinks... I got a \"Weird\" feeling in there.. After 10 min of no acknowledgment  I got up and left..."}
{"text":"Soooooo I gave this place another try... And I have to say I spoke too soon! Maybe the time before was just a bad night but I have since been back... Again and again. And this place is awesome! The regulars are cool as f*** Tiffany and Stephanie are awesome... Mark is crazy, in a good awesome sort of way, and it has become my new hangout!   Gin Mill - you guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"I don't always go here but have on occasion since it's near my parent's house but very friendly staff, kept the drinks coming, & good food!"}
{"text":"The gin mill is a great dive bar. They have pool and darts and a lot of other games. The gaming is excellent and the staff is great. Carlo is the manager and runs it very well. After midnight they have $2 heinekens and lite beers. At about 2am all the leftover food in the kitchen is put out free for everyone to eat. Usually pizza and chicken wings and fries and whatever is left over. Excellent watering hole!!!"}
{"text":"Finally had a good visit here the food was hot and tasted pretty good especially since it was a 99 cent breakfast special !! Waitress was attentive and seem to give everybody equal attention. It's about 9:30 in the morning and there are only six people in the place. Much better experience than last visit."}
{"text":"I didn't care for this place one bit and it's a shame because it's near my home and initially I thought this would be my go to place. We entered and sat ourselves at the bar. Looked at the menu and once she decided to come around and we mentioned food she said the kitchen was closed for the night, but that there are other restaurants in the same plaza, like del taco and Arby's?? Umm thanks for suggesting we leave to eat someplace else when clearly we came to this place to not have drinks as well, and for mentioning del taco and Arby's. Don't you think if that's what we wanted we would have gone there initially? Anyways, she was rude about it and we walked out. This place reeks of smoke and it seems like the ppl here are regulars and they get priority. Won't be back here."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much a dive bar. It's super dark and has a seedy vibe. The patrons were a little frightening. It is old and run down looking. We only came here while the car was getting oil changed and a few things done at Jiffy Lube next door. We were going to game, eat and leave. Well, the bartender was not interested in us and service was just ok.  Wings were nothing to write home about. It's not the worst place I have been but it is a place I won't return to."}
{"text":"Ok so yes its a dark smoky bar behind a gas station and a few fast food places but its my neighborhood bar and I love it. Don't expect anything fancy or lavish remember the Bellagio is about 15min in the other direction. Just go in and have some drinks eat a burger and kick back because that's what your supposed to do after a long day at work at your neighborhood bar!"}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times- a definite dive bar and the crowd is all regulars- they frequently run out of certain liquor as (whoever is ordering is clueless) but if you've got a few backup plans it's a great little spot for a few drinks- very casual and the bartenders are super nice"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 7 years great little neighborhood bar and grill. All the staff are enjoyable to be around and the people that come in are all pretty genuine. If you are a non smoker it does get to be a little too much on some nights. I've tried almost everything on the menu and it is all delicious! If you want your own little neighborhood tavern give the Gin Mill a try!"}
