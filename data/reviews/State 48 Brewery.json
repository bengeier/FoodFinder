{"text":"The service here is so incredibly terrible that I'm writing a review... which I rarely do.  Great beer.  Great appetizers,  TERRIBLE customer service.  In the interest of fairness,  we've gone three times in the past seven days.  First time,  we had a huge party.  Service was slow as molasses.  We ended up going to the bar to place our drink order.  We were also the last to leave,  because our waitress apparently forgot about us.  Second time,  my husband went with a group from work.  What was scheduled to be an hour get together for apps and a beer turned into two because... service. We thought we'd try sitting outside just now,  have a beer in the sun after going to Lowe's,  and give them another chance.  We literally sat at a table for 15 minutes without even getting a menu,  let alone eye contact, and walked out.  I understand being busy.  As you're walking by a table,  just say, \"Hey! We are super busy,  but I see you and I'll be right with you.\" Simple.  Such a bummer,  because there is such a need in Surprise for a gastro pub, or someplace that isn't another chain."}
{"text":"Came here last night.... food was great. Atmosphere was awesome... NO COMPLAINTS HERE!!!"}
{"text":"The service here is awesome! Everyone from the waitstaff to the managers. Our waitress Erica was very attentive and helpful with suggestions. The manager Jarod was also attentive to his guests and restaurant. They also have a dog friendly patio which I will be bringing my dog to in the future :)"}
{"text":"These guys are holding an oktoberfest at their restaurant, and things are awesome.  Hundreds of people enjoying home-made beers, brats, and pretzels being sold like hot cakes. I'm amazed at how good the beers are for being a new brewery... truly good/diverse beers. I'm a happy camper... literally as I've been here since 12, and it's now 6:30 pm. Woohoo to awesome beers and food! Thank you State 48!"}
{"text":"Horrible Service!!! Asked for extra sauce and didn't receive, manager and waitress rudely took chairs from table without saying anything to us, waiter tipped themselves without asking and when I asked to receive the bill without the tip he gave himself, he gave us the manager which took a long time to talk to, and when asking for the normal bill she gave a lecture about the food industry (as if we didn't understand) then called it \"just a couple bucks\" if its just a couple bucks to you then you pay it, and not lecture us on servers tipping out other people!!!"}
{"text":"I love that they offer local Arizona wine and beer, with their home brew coming soon. The food is delicious and even though this is only day 2 of being open, you guys are killing it! So glad to have a new spot for date nights :)"}
{"text":"This has got to be the best restaurant on this side of town. We stopped by on a whim and the food is AMAZING! We had the fish n chips and the rotisserie chicken. The best meal I've had in in a long time. Their beer selections are amazing. Our server was Vann, he was so friendly, personable, and knowledgable, truly and asset here. His love and knowledge of craft beer is so apparent! Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Came in last night for dinner. 1st of all, I was disappointed with the brewery not having its own beer on tap. But after Vann greeted us, he turned all that angst into a joke. He obviously knew we were a little bothered by the in house brews not being available. Then he started asking us all what our personal favorite beer was.. he began running through the list of beers that he had on tap and started asking if any of us had ever tried them.. there is only a couple that on the a few of us I tried before the most part nobody had tried most of the beer list. We all laughed and realized that the beer on tap did not matter. My husband started asking questions about the food. Vann assured us that the burgers we're unlike anything we had ever had before. Anyway to cut to the chase, we enjoyed every single beer that was recommended for us not requested, recommended.. the burgers were to die for. The hallow bun was incredible. The steak flavored burgers were on point. If you come into this restaurant, ASK FOR VANN! The menu did kind of look a little bit scary but if you leave the plates alone and enjoy them as they are served every single flavor brings out the best in each other just like Vann our server recommended!!! The pizza was delicious too!! What are you waiting for surprise, go check it out!! Awesome Atmosphere! We will be back"}
{"text":"Great to have a brewery not too far. Have yet to try one of their own, but will get there. Could use some help with ensuring staff is on top of refills and ensuring food goes out at right temp, but ambience and choices will keep me coming back. Happy to have them here!"}
{"text":"We love the food at this pub -- and the crafted beers are awesome, too.  We go there often."}
{"text":"Went there recently and thought the beer was great! The mango one and Christmas one was amazing."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Saw a packed parking lot and thought we found a good place. My companion had her pizza delivered and eaten before we could find our waitress to ask where the other meals were. She checked (?) on the other meals but never came back to inform us. When we were able to find her again she said she checked but the kitchen was busy. Never refilled our water/ice tea/soda glasses or asked if one friend would like another beer. When our other 2 meals were delivered they were barely warm; obviously sat in the kitchen too long. Roasted corn slaw had exactly 4 kernels of corn. The waitress said that's the way it's always served. Sounds like false advertising. Basically the food tasted fine but who wants to sit and wait while waiting for food or waiting for someone to finish. Felt like the place just opened and no one was trained. Hopefully it will improve but seems like they're working on a very tight budget. They also need to wash their very greasy floor!"}
{"text":"I have given this place multiple chances thinking the service would be better and it never is. Every time we have come here there has been an issue , (example) out of a certain beer on the menu; out of a certain food that is on the menu; brunch was a disaster....the table cinnamon rolls were hard as a brick and had to be sent back twice. And the last straw was tonight when we go there only for the Fat Tuesday menu and we look at the website for the hours.....close at 10:00. We have a group to go and are meeting there after work coming from North Phoenix. First part of the group gets there st 8:45 to be told the kitchen closed st 9:00 and all food ordered have to in 10 minutes. Other part of the group is parking in the parking lot at this time. Remember, they advertise close at 10:00........what restaurant closes their kitchen a hour before they close!  We were told we could not order an item as appetizer before our food order because then the 10 minute window would be over and all the food had to come out  at the same time. So we order all the food at the same time and it comes out all together except One persons food, his pizza came to the table 15 minutes later after we were just about finished eating. Not only were we rushed, the manager on duty could care less  and offered no solution other than they need that time for prep time. We all agreed that enough is enough and we will no longer be going there or bringing any guest back there ever again. And I mean EVER ....no more chances ....DONE!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten at State 48 several times. We really like this restaurant and will continue to go there. My favorite is their meatloaf, delicious with real mashed potatoes. My husband also ordered meatloaf and loved it. ( Funny I have never seen  him ear meatloaf before). We also have had hamburgers and steak.  Everything is delicious and the waitstaff is wonderful. Btw they have a tremendous selection of beers which is my husbands favorite part."}
{"text":"Had dinner with family in their outdoor seating area.  By far, the best burgers in the area. My sister-in-law had the porkchop and said it was to die for. We will be going back every time we are here for spring training."}
{"text":"After living in Surprise for 3 years we have had the worst luck with finding a restaurant that we would call our favorite, the search is over! Amazing food, relaxing atmosphere, and very friendly knowledgeable wait staff. The food is to die for! And it's walking distance from our house! This is a fantastic addition to this little city! Outside patio with a bar will be great as it cools down too!"}
{"text":"great beers and great food!! I love the homemade soups and don't miss out on the cheese dip ohhh yummy"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and beer selection. Had outstanding service at he bar when we went. Very personable staff. Will go again."}
{"text":"Well, without even getting through the door I am disappointed. The website is no longer available. We wanted to check out what beers they had, what the menu offered etc before we went. Why do places offer up a website that either is gone or never updated? There are lots of choices for dinner. This one isn't going to be ours."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place and based on the reviews I thought we were in for a great dining experience.  What a disappointment!!! The food took about an hour to come out.  We asked the server to check on our food since it took so long, she snapped saying it has not been that long. Very unprofessional.  The food finally came and it was cold and inedible!!! We asked to speak to the manager. He came over a talked to us and offered to replace our meals. We declined since we were there for 90 minutes and we didn't want to wait another hour.  The service was slow (we had to ask repeatedly for water refills) and unprofessional  and the food was cold.   Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Attended the Beer Pairing Dinner last night.  These guys are making some great beer and compliments to the Chef for the 6 course perfect pairings. Especially enjoyed the Chile infused Rough Rider IPA with the to die for roasted corn bisque with grilled moho shrimp, the cilantro infused tagliani pasta, goat and Amber Ale with chocolate-chipolte rubbed filet of venison.  Keep your eye on this brewery.  If you get a chance try the Beer Pairing Dinner!"}
{"text":"I stop here when I'm getting my car detailed.  Best fries ever!!!! They have a good selection of beers and the staff understands when you just want to be left alone.  I often work while I'm there and they tend to seat me away from other people.  Great place."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a happy hour beer. Nice place sat at the bar had one of their IPAs and a pretzel. The cheese dipping sauce was I think processed cheese and salsa. It was ok. The beer and the pretzel were good. I think because it is so new they are still working on the menu. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I so much want to like this place.  They have a good beer selection; including a few of my preferred style (which can be hard to find in a world of IPA's and stouts).  Unfortunately, that's about the best I have to say.  While they have plenty of beers to choose from, prices are high; especially for anything in bottles & cans (like $6 a can/bottle high).    The food menu is also less than to be desired for my taste.  Too much fancy stuff.  I appreciate trying to offer something different but why does it have to be nearly every item? From the appetizer menu: hummus, elotes, brussels sprouts, cauliflower wings, poutine.  I know some may think it's boring, but how about some \"standard\" fare?  Fires, potato skins, onion rings, mozzarella sticks?  Something?  To be fare there are pretzels (which are good) and chicken wings.  I did have the pizza one time and found it to be bland and did not like it.  Then again, I think pizza is very subjective when it comes to peoples tastes; so I'm sure many will like it.  I do remember liking the crust.      Lastly, I question the service.  Everyone is certainly friendly, but they seem short staffed; at least at the bar.  Too often, we wait to be served or we sit with an empty glass.  Also, servers have no idea where to bring food to people at the bar.  I'm constantly approached with other peoples orders."}
{"text":"Meh. This place is so inconsistent. One visit, we all had great food, interesting beer, and a fantastic server. We couldn't wait to come back and try more of the menu. Another time we got takeout and both of our burgers (A veggie and a PB&J) were grossly undercooked, so we figured take out is not their thing. The next visit was back to what we expected, so we didn't hesitate to bring family with us for dinner tonight.  Well, what a disappointment. We ordered the pretzels and upon delivery, the cup of mustard slid off the tray and plopped into my drink. The food delivery guy returned with a fresh glass of water, except that wasn't what I was drinking. Our server corrected that as soon as I mentioned it. Our food arrived quickly, minus my pizza. No mention of when to expect the pizza, so I assumed it was on its way. Thankfully I had also ordered a side salad, so wasn't completely without food except there were quite a few black, wilty bits to be picked out of the spring mix. The rest of my group was halfway through their meal and I had been done with the salad for quite a while when the pizza arrived. Our server explained the time difference as a result of having 2 different kitchens working on our order. If that is indeed the case, then a better system needs to be put in place. There is no reason that this can't be better coordinated. At about this point, we realized that one of the burgers was a little undercooked in the middle and my dad's asparagus was crunchy.   Now any one of these would have been forgivable, but the combination of all these on top of the price is just ridiculous. I will say that the pizza was very good and our server was pleasant, however I don't think we will return for a meal. I really want to like State 48 and there's so much potential here, but they need to figure out how to be more consistent in the food they're sending out of their 2 kitchens."}
{"text":"We are so happy to have this non-chain restaurant in town! The place has been tastefully updated and service was great on a busy Friday night. We were really hopeful that the food would be decent and it exceeded our expectations! Great burger and fish tacos and the s'mores dessert was amazing!"}
{"text":"If this restaurant is going to last, they really need to step up their service.   You can get good food at many other places, but service is what puts the polish on any establishment.  While the server was friendly, the server also needed lessons in Waiting Tables 101.  Waters and beverages never refilled; plates never pulled; never checked back to make sure everything was okay; was unaware of menu items that had been 86'd for the day.  Our server would go to a table near to ours, but would fail to check on us; it wasn't just us, it was other tables as well.   We flagged down another server, asking for a refill on water and he commented that the pitcher in his hand was tea, not water, and kept walking.  One would think he could have either said, 'let me get your waitress' or could have simply grabbed a water pitcher himself and pitched in to HELP out our server.  We were never given more water.    We waited 50 minutes for our food.  The appetizer we ordered came out with the main entrees.  After 45 minutes, we did notice a large party in another room which could explain the delay.  The kitchen was obviously backed up, but no apology, explanation or exception was offered for the significant delay...   I am usually one to give places a second chance, but after reading other \"Yelps\" that seem to mirror this one, I doubt I will return for lunch or dinner.   This would probably be an okay place to go for a beer - they have a nice beer menu - and perhaps some pretzels.   Bon Appetit."}
{"text":"This is the former sushi joint on Bell Road. I was excited to try it out for lunch and brought my wing loving son with me.  At first glance one wonders why they covered the exterior with metal sheets. It looks clumsy and hot. My son remarked that they should call it The Oven.  I want to be more elaborate but honestly it was a bad experience. I ordered a burger in a lettuce wrap, pink, and it was as dry as can be. Tasted like there was liver in the mix. Chewing on it dried out my mouth. I sent it back and ate only the modest side salad. The basil vinaigrette was delicious.  My son ordered the jumbo wings which were regular size and were \"okay\".  In the end, with tip included for good service, I spent $24 for a small side salad, wings, and iced tea. I was not charged for the hockey pucks. I consider that amount a failure on both our parts.  In response to Mario: a poorly cooked burger cannot be redeemed with sauces. My burger had goat cheese and it was supposed to have aioli on it. That is sufficient to enhance the flavor yet it still fell short of even fast food quality. It is unsettling and revealing that you aren't aware of this. Grass feed beef is known to require a more gentle preparation than conventional meat.   The reviews are showing you to be someone inclined to manhandle guests and/or to forbid them from visiting your establishment again. Surprise is not a community that will reward such behaviors. I strongly encourage you to get someone more amiable to represent your restaurant. Blaming me for that tragedy of a burger has lost you yet another client."}
{"text":"food was great service was horrible...plenty of servers just no sense of urgency. hopefully they see this and make some necessary adjustments."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Seems like the service could use a little work but thats to be expected with any new restaurant. I came here a few weeks ago with some friends and had a blast."}
{"text":"It would seem reading a couple of reviews that people feel obligated to like the food based on the fact that they paid $12 for a bland burger, that is not even served the way it was requested.  Of course the fact that it did not come as ordered is a function of a larger problem, that being service.  We were not acknowledged by the hostess until we had walked well past her station, apparently it was our job to facilitate a conversation.  Our server started off as attentive, then quickly forgot about us.  Our appetizer arrived quickly enough, but we finished has our tabled bussed and sat around for several minutes waiting for our dinner order to be taken.  She asked my wife if she needed box and was told please.  She came around more than 5 minutes later without a box, my wife had to ask again at which time we emphasized we were ready to go, to ensure we didn't have a long delay waiting.  The bill was returned without a word, much less a thank you.  I found it interesting that a person at the outside patio brought Chipotle to eat, though she was ordering beer.  The bartender noticed this, said something, but allowed the person to stay.  Perhaps they are only concerned with the brewery aspect of the business."}
{"text":"Overpriced; mediocre food and drinks; sub-par service. Blah. I was really excited for the brewery's opening but it has left me very disappointed overall."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited and anticipated the opening of this place and just in the last week was finally able to stop by. I tried a couple of their brews and found them to be decent enough. The service was okay, it did take forever to get some water though. Food-Yea, this place is just posing as a brewery because the food is where it is at. We had the following: Poutine-Great stuff that surprised me.  Fish N Chips- Nothing crazy here but the tartar sauce was great(I don't usually like tartar sauce) the roasted corn slaw, well I could have made a meal just out of it. We finished things off with a Fig n Prosciutto Pizza-Delicious, even if you don't think you like these items, still delicious. So, yes I will def. be back because the food is great."}
{"text":"Best micro brews we have ever had....  came in from out of town and ended up there two nights in a row.  Will be a regular stop for us."}
{"text":"Beer selection, awesome! Burgers, awesome! Pizza, ditto! Best French fries I've had. Meghan was a  great server!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Terrible service and bad management. The food is good IF it comes out right!"}
{"text":"Our second time having a beer and snack. Was just ok. Our host gave us the opinion she wanted to be somewhere else. The waiter was friendly and helpful and attentive. Beer was ok."}
{"text":"Great menu selection. Different choices than you normally see on brewery menus. Loved the beet salad. Definitely a restaurant to frequent often"}
{"text":"So I am writing this review after my 4th visit.   1st visit: My wife and I had seen the opening soon sign for several months and had been waiting for it to open. We went to sushi nearby and noticed that it was open on the way back from dinner. We were already full from dinner but figured we'd try some beers. We were disappointed that they didn't have their own brews yet, but the beers we did have were delicious. The light colored coffee beer was unique and the 300 foot Steve was one of the better beers I've had on tap.  2nd visit: We came for lunch this time so we could try some of the food and we noticed a bomb-looking salad on our first visit so we decided to get some salads. I got the peach and prosciutto salad. It was really good and filling enough for lunch. I got the 300 Foot Steve beer Super positive experience overall.  3rd visit: This is really where I was won over. We came for dinner and invited a friend. Finally a restaurant in Surprise I can invite a friend and feel confident in the food and experience. We started with poutine and it was as horribly-amazing as poutine is supposed to be. My wife and I shared the diavola pizza and our friend ordered the peanut butter and jelly burger (you read that correctly). The pizza was probably in the top 5 pizzas I've had in the last year, but you really need to like spicy food to enjoy. The real star was the PBJ burger. My wife and I both tried a bite, and my god is that thing some unholy pact with the devil. By all rights it shouldn't be good, but it really, really was.  4th visit: This time was all beer all the time. I tried the freak'n raspberry, 300 ft steve (again bc it's that good), Sun-up Amber, and an IPA I can't remember the name. The raspberry was good, but not as sour as I would have liked for a beer in that category. Sun-up Amber was the weakest of the bunch. IPA was solid  Overall after 4 visits, the service was always prompt and friendly. The food was always excellent and inventive. This is the restaurant that my wife and I have wished was in Surprise since we moved here 7 years ago. We will be returning often and are so happy that it's here.  TL;DR - Go here try awesome food, drink awesome beer, be surprised it's in surprise."}
{"text":"Wow! What an improvement to the service. I now give this 5 stars. Our server was very interested in knowing my husband's opinion of the various IPAs that he tried. She wanted feedback to help determine what beers are ordered for the future. Also interested in how we liked the food. This time we had rotisserie chicken which came with a very good corn risotto and fish and chips which were crispy on outside without overcooking the cod. We went at about 7 PM on a Saturday and there was a 15 minute wait. Can't wait until their own beers are ready."}
{"text":"Quaint atmosphere with the friendliest employees!  We have dined here for 2 years, and have never been disappointed with the fare or service. Fresh food and a great selection of desserts :)"}
{"text":"Great place. Service was a little slow but food was great.  Wings were really good, and roasted beet salad was fantastic.  Beer selection was great too. Tried a couple of their beers, both really good. Will try more next time."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Good food. Great beer. Really nice addition to the Surprise dining scene."}
{"text":"Went there today and the food was average, my wife ordered a burger and asked for mustard. The waitress brought out mustard but it was Dijon mustard, which is what she does not like so she asked if we can have another burger and they did and charge us for it! I basically paid for three burgers. Customer service was ok beer was pretty weak. They call them selves a brewery and don't make their own beer! Bill came out to over 70 dollars way over price... Won't be back again"}
{"text":"Completely unimpressed with the way this place is operated.  It was my husbands birthday and I told the hostess on two separate occasions, all we wanted was to watch the football game,  After waiting over 1/2 an hour, we were finally seated in a separate room from the bar area where all the TVS are.....and given a table where one of us has our back to the TV in that room .....so one of us cannot watch the game.   I expressed once again, how can we watch the game in this situation, we were told  they would locate a different table for us only to find that the hostess never came back.   Everyone started fighting about who would take the seat with no TV views and the whole evening turned into an absolute mess.   Thanks so much for fucking up my husbands birthday."}
{"text":"This had a great atmosphere, nice and clean with good food. The service was a bit slow when we were there, but we still enjoyed it since we had no time constraints. The staff was friendly though:)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place since it has opened. My wife and I have been there several times and have brought friends and family and no one has been disappointed. The food is amazing, especially anything with beer cheese fondue. The beer selection is great focusing on local craft beers along with their own. We always love coming here."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and I cannot wait to go back ! I had the carnitas sandwich and it was to die for ! I have found my new favorite meal and my boyfriend had the state burger and was also wonderfully delicious. Cooked perfect with just enough flavor. Our waitress was friendly and helpful,  always available for all the little extras we needed throughout dinner.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite place in Surprise!! Great food, fantastic service, fun atmosphere, and terrific local beer! The outside patio feels like a party. So much fun!!"}
{"text":"State 48 earned five stars for service \"above and beyond\" last night. We were a tennis team of 12 in for Nationals. We had a reservation. Unfortunately,  the reservation was lost. Worse, it was Friday nite and the place was jammed. Instead of turning us away, William,  the manager, immediately offered us their private room, found us a waitress, Brittany?, and the rest was fabulous service from start to finish."}
{"text":"Exactly what Surprise, AZ needed! Craft beers and great food.   A group of us went for opening day to sample the beers. No one was disappointed! I loved the Peoria Artisan Hunny Hal Honey Jalapeno Ale (light, full of flavor, jalapeno in the background) and the Freak'N Raspberry Wheat (light, very drinkable, not sweet). Others at the table had 8-Bit Hopsassins Creed, B.R.I. Lolli, and Sun Up Awesome Amber.  Went back the next day to check out the lunch to share a bunch of things. Our server, Alex, was great! Here's what we had:  Pretzels & Beer Cheese Fondue: the kids and adults loved these. They had a good amount of coarse salt on top....despite other reviews, we actually really enjoyed this! Beer cheese and grainy mustard were a thumbs up.  Craft Mac & Cheese: Creamy and cheesy.  Shrimp Ceviche Stuffed Avocado: Ceviche mix was nice and light, not too dressed. The homemade tortilla chips were perfectly seasoned and we enjoyed them just on their own.   Beer Cheese Steak (with chips): On par. Would eat again. I thought the amount of cheese was great (it did appear to be the Beer Cheese Fondue...this is not a complaint). Our server explained that the beef was local and that for most menu items, you can ask your server were your ingredients came from. Thought that was a nice, thoughtful touch. Chips were super thin, crispy, and light. Nice job.  Sonoran Burger (with fries): Ordered it pink, on challah bun. Everything about this was great. No complaints here. Bread was light, ingredients were perfect amounts, enjoyed the thin patties. The fries were perfect; crispy and seasoned.  Also, they installed the Cold Press Nitro Coffee and Cold Press Draught Coffee while we were dining so we ordered the Nitro. Highly recommend for the strong coffee lover. So smooth. Ask your server for the details.  If you live in the area, check it out! We need more places like this. The vibe is fun and there are artsy touches everywhere. Will be returning, would highly recommend.   PS- Not one person in the party (even those with children) took issue with the women's room artwork ;) Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great local spot! They had great service and the food was delicious! No leftovers here. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place and after reading the reviews, we were on the fence and I'm so glad we gave them a chance.    First, the décor is awesome with cool blue wingback chairs, comfy booths and the music was upbeat and fun.  Service was great, Haley was friendly, attentive and full of suggestions for our first visit.  Great beer selection and although some of the menu items are what you would expect, there are little nuances that make an average dish, above average.  So happy to have State 48 Brewery in my community and we will be back."}
{"text":"We have been quite a few times since they opened. Great atmosphere. The staff is awesome! Have tried something different each time. So far my favorite is the PB&J burger and the churro bread pudding. Love the localness of the beers and the food. The decor is fun and funky. Looking forward to their own brews, but love the variety of local brews to tide us over! Cheers!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Friday night, so it was busy and servers were running around like crazy. We were lucky to have Joseph as our server, and he was awesome! He had the absolute best personality and charisma!  We ordered wings, tacos, and enotes, and everything was excellent! We also had the pleasure of talking to Jeremy, the GM, and he was great. Overall, it was a chill evening with good food ... what more can you ask for?!"}
{"text":"All the food is delicious - especially the burgers!!  Love the vibe and the beautiful interior.  Such a great place to have in this location.  We will be back - many times!!"}
{"text":"I give State 48 a 2/5.  At the hostess's suggestion, had a drink at the bar as we waited for our table.  30 minutes later asked her when our table would be ready.  She said she already called my name.  I just laughed and told her you told me to wait at the bar but you never came in.  Anyway got seated soon after at a strange round table that was totally out of place, asked server to change and he said no problem.  People came in after that, were seated at that same round table and they also asked to move.  Just odd.   Beers were great (not theirs though)!  Knowledgeable (but little obnoxious) server (kept calling my wife sweety and me bro or something).  Pretzel app was good. Ceviche was ok, little skimpy on the shrimp and hard to eat.  Fish and chips were great.  State 48 burger was bland (kept using the cheese sauce from the pretzel app to flavor it).  Don't know if I'll try again."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Friday evening. Had a short wait. Had a coupon for a beer flight that stated \"as often as you wish\". Wouldn't one assume it could be used more than once? The waitress said she had to keep it and I couldn't be used again. Huh?  The food was just OK. Had a burger that was quite dry and not very tasty. The ketchup tasted like Campbell's tomato soup, watered down.   The only plus was the pretzel appetizer, which was very good once you scraped off the thick layer of salt."}
{"text":"Visited on 7/23/16 - Being in Surprise, anything new is worth a try since everything else is a drive.  Love the idea of State 48 (local brew, local food), and I think I had too high of an expectation  for the recently opened restaurant.  Decent crowd for 8pm on a Saturday night, when we walked in the noise level is what you would expect from a brewery/Americana pub. The layout of the restaurant is divided between where bar area and seats are, and what feels like a secondary seating area where the pizza oven and cooking station is.  We didn't wait at all to get seated, though we did get seated in the significantly less busy pizza oven side. Given the high walls of the booth, it really made it seem like we were isolated moreso than we were.  Our waitress was very nice, though she didn't make any sort of menu recommendations or beer suggestions.   Even though we're at a brewery,  my wife isn't a beer drinker, we were both a little surprised there weren't any well/mixed drinks on the drink menu. (Could've missed it but I'm pretty sure there was nothing). Now the wife could've asked, but instead she defaulted to her coke and I went with the Grand Canyon Ale (had it before, always enjoy it).  Food: Beer ketchup is different, can't say one way or another if either of us liked it. I got the Beer Cheese burger, and the wife got the fish and chips. My burger was great. I can see this being a great place to go for a burger and beer.   The fish and chips unfortunately weren't good. The batter seemed to have heavy flakes of what we are thinking was rosemary (you could see the flakes in outside, fried batter). That taste was very overpowering and left pretty much my wife's whole plate untouched. $15 unfortunately wasted.  Our waitress did offer to get something else, but in truth by that time we had decided to finish our night elsewhere.   A beer, coke and two meals was about $40 after tip. The sad thing is, I had walked in expecting to spend more time and more money there. From the seating in the quieter side, lack of simple house drinks for none beer drinkers(or at least being aware of them), to the strike out on the fish and chips, the little things added up . So instead of a few more drinks, and some desert, we had those elsewhere.   Unrelated note but I've typed too much and I'm not going back: I was really hoping to see some sort of mini-beer sampler on the menu.  Overall: Will I return? Yes, the burger was good and the beer is beer. Will it be soon? Probably in a few months. Still a little bit of growing pains it seems, and as they continue to work out the menu I'll give them a little more time before I go on again."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of going for dinner and drinks at the State 48 Brewery. We arrived around 7 pm on a Friday night. We were greeted by the friendly host staff and promptly seated. Laura, our server, was friendly and very good at her job. We appreciated how well she took care of us. The beer: I was surprised and happy to find out they carried Dubina Bell Road IPA- it was one of my favorite AZ beers. They had a number of other local micro brews. My friend's wife had the coffee infused pale ale. She said she found her new favorite beer. For dinner we had The Boss pizza. It's a brick fired oven pizza and it was amazing. Large chunks of Italian sausage, pepperoni and roasted red peppers all with the right amount of fresh mozzarella cheese. We will defiantly be back to try some of the menu items and the other AZ beers"}
{"text":"This place was very good. My girlfriend is a pain in the ass when she orders, and our server Tyler did a great job catering to her. He brought different beers to taste and answered a million questions. Tyler was knowledgable and very friendly. Food was amazing. The tater tot nachos were superb as was my brisket sandwich. Girlfriend had an artichoke, garlic, and chicken pizza that was very good as well. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was just there with the family, great service and food. Brian was our server and he was great. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today for a nice outdoor lunch.  We sat on the patio and it was not too loud. Started with the Sausage board. It had three different sausages that were all delicious, some pickled vegetables (yummy), and some spicy mustard.  Not much mustard so we asked for more... and unfortunately were out.  They were making more,  but apparently an involved process. The Roasted Beet Salad was very good and we were able to substitute romaine for the spring mix.  Lastly,  the Carnitas Torta was very good but I felt it lacked enough Carnitas (meat)...!  We will be back and enjoy some adult beverages next time!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Outdoor seating with games like cornhole. Good selection of local beers. Our server, crystal, was amazing!"}
{"text":"A great place to meet friends and grab a few apps and brews. The Shrimp Ceviche Stuffed Avocados one of my favorites along with the warm pretzel with a great cheese dip. Let's not forget the wood fired pizza, which is wonderful."}
{"text":"If you are within 30 min of this place GO! If you are at the Wigwam and looking for a great spot for craft beers, great food and cool bar, GO! Pretzel, cheese and mustard app was great. Wood fired pizzas are great. I like hot, and usually disappointed. I had the Diavolo with the chili oil, and my lips are still feeling it 20 min later without burning my tongue off, the best pizza I've had ever. Can't wait to come back, thanks for a great night watching football, spicy pizza, cold beer!"}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday to try the place out, the building inside and out are awesome very nice patio too. I didn't try the food but did try the beer. I enjoyed the IPA and the stout but the other 3 beers were just so so. Will try again later after they work the bugs out!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  The service is outstanding.  The waitresses are cute :-)   The beer is really good. I really like the double IPA. The burgers were great. The pretzels were the best. I hope to try more soon."}
{"text":"I've been to this brew house a couple times with my boyfriend. The selection of beer is great and the food is very tasty.  We've tried the Diavolo (spicy sweet taste) and Margherita pizzas... and the Southwestern pasta decent size portion.   The times we've gone we have always sat at the bar and the service was great, the bartenders are attentive and friendly.   I just wish they were open later especially on the weekends.... the kitchen closes early even on the weekends I believe the kitchen closed at 10pm, so you need to make it there early if you want to order food."}
{"text":"Such a great atmosphere to be in , Amazing servers , Outstanding pizza guys and don't even get me started on their rotating dessert menu  100% recommend to all my family and friends , You want great food and some change in your life ? GO TO STATE 48"}
{"text":"This is a late post from April. We drive by frequently and finally decided to try it on a Saturday. My husband checked us in at 12:30 p.m. I noticed immediately that the bar was busy and there was one bartender. She was fast but no one could manage a full bar AND make drinks for entire restaurant. That should have been our first clue to leave. We got seated quickly ,but server took 16 minutes to get to our table. But the real issue was how long we waited for our food. When we asked our server she simply replied\" do you want me to cancel your order?\" Food arrived 80 minutes later. Looked good but it was horrible. My son burger was burnt and he ordered medium. I ordered a carne asada or something like that and it came to the table cold and less than 3 oz. of meat. When I went up front to speak to hostess,  she kindly asked manager to come speak to me. 20 minutes and he still ignored me. She was amazing and I felt bad for her. I sensed that she was all too familiar with scenarios like ours. I finally spoke to another employee whom I don't recall her title. She was kind and apologetic and the one the manager was kind enough to send out. I understand the flow of a kitchen and the necessity of all hands on deck during rush times. But it takes 30 seconds to acknowledge a disgruntled customer . I hate to see another restaurant fail again here in Surprise, but this one is headed there quickly if they don't make some serious changes."}
{"text":"Awesome bar with incredible food this has become our go to brewery  Highly recommend, they deserve 10 stars  I feel compelled to give another review not because I frequent this place a lot but because they are always trying to improve the customers experience, their brewer is exceptional always pushing the limits the Barleywine addition was awesome, smooth and very drinkable for a big beer, great bartenders always help as well."}
{"text":"I don't remember what I ordered because it was disgusting... sorry. However my bf ordered a burger and was on point. I'm ready to go back and order that. Beer selection is good. We got two flights. Good size samples. Love it."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place as we had driven by several times. I ordered the schnitzel sandwich and my wife ordered the State burger.  They should rename the schnitzel sandwich \"The onion sandwich with schnitzel.  There was some some schnitzel but there was a large red onion in the middle which made up most of the sandwich. Very disappointing.  My wife's State burger was fantastic.  The service was poor at best.  Had to go up to the front desk to ask for a waitress for the bill. Finally another waitress got us a bill after we waited so long.  They put us in the back behind the pizza bar, which did not get a lot of attention. Some of the waitresses made recommendations but ours did not. Not sure if we will go back or not."}
{"text":"Went for fish and chips which was recommended by a friend. Looked good but both the fish and the chips were way too salty. Should have sent them back. We did tell the waitress and she commented that someone else had complained the other night about the food being too salty. I seriously doubt that she even passed the info on to the cook. If we do go back and the food is too salty you can bet we will send it back."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. First impressions were that it was clean, lots of seating, inside and out. Music was too loud to carry on a conversation. We were seated at a half booth. Booth portion was uncomfortable. (Seat was caved in, too low for table.  We ordered the fish and chips to split, as recommended by our server, Shea. Fish was very good. Plenty for both of us. It came with unremarkable coleslaw, and limp  French fries. (We asked for extra crispy fries)  Service was excellent. Shea was very friendly, and attentive."}
{"text":"We love state 48! The beers are great, the food is awesome and I love the rotating menu for desserts and things! Try the PB and jelly burger and the creme brulees!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a huge bar and pretends at serving food.  Had the worst meal ever and paid a lot!  The decor belongs in a mid evil castle. The service was terrible.  I will not return."}
{"text":"Supremely overpriced for simply average food and service. The beer selection is very good and they should definitely continue to concentrate on that section of the business."}
{"text":"Really a fun place.  Great atmosphere, attentive and friendly servers and very good pizza and wings.  The only reason I would not give it a 5 star rating was that they were out of three of the beers I really wanted to try.  Definitely still a place I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times and I guess all I can do is 3 stars. The patio is great but the service leaves a little to be desired. I love the Mango beer but they always seem to be out. They are the only micro brew in Surprise."}
{"text":"Very confused on how to rate this place. I so wanted to like this place. Willing to give it another try after the brewery opens. Beer selection is no bad but, with all the micro brews in the US I don't understand why they are selling the local competition beer? Why not sell Booty's wings why you are at it. I have to admit the beer cheese is pretty good but, if you don't make your own beer yet how are you making your beer cheese. Same thing with the IPA mustard. Let me guess using a local brewery for your beer cheese and mustard. Last thing what ever happened to a basic Caesar salad. Kale and tomatoes in a Caesar salad?"}
{"text":"FINALLY!!!!!!!!  STATE 48 a soon to be Surprise landmark!!! We've been here twice in the last 4 days, my now FAVORITE place! I can't believe people have the nerve to blast them with negative reviews when they haven't even been open a week! GIVE ME A BREAK!On Saturday we were in with a group of friends for drinks and dinner.  Already a great beer selection, Can't wait to see what they have to offer! Now let's talk about the AMAZING FOOD!!!! I ordered the fried chicken...... DELICIOUS, huge portion for just $16 the corn bread is to die for! The rest of the table ordered pizza and wings, the pizza is the best in Surprise! The wings were taking longer than expected, we had a visit from the Head Chef( and owner) just to apologize for the long wait. He wanted to ensure us that they would be out momentarily, well worth the wait. It was then that I knew that they were the type of business owners that take GREAT PRIDE in their business.  My husband and I celebrated our Anniversary today and I couldn't wait to get back here! Tonight my hubby ordered the pizza again, I had the pork chop plate. The pork was soo good, moist and tender. The polenta was delicious.  We own a Salon in surprise and I will tell every client that sits in my chair about this AMAZING PLACE!  Keep up the good work!!!!"}
{"text":"So took the family to try State 48 last week. First the pros: I had The Boss pizza. It was delicious. Though a couple of things did diminish my experience. First, for a $15 pie it should be bigger. The Boss is a small/personal pizza at other pizzerias. Next, there was too much flour on the bottom crust. I know they use it to keep the pizza from sticking in the wood-fired oven. But, for the love of God, less could be used. My son had the chicken wings-- as with the pizza, the wings were delicious-- though overpriced (10 wings for $11)! My daughter had the chicken Caesar salad. She didn't really care for it-- but she is 9, so not a big surprise. My wife ordered one of the sandwiches-- I forget which one. She too enjoyed the meal. My wife and I shared the beet salad. Wife liked it; I did not. I didn't like the salad because of the greens. I'm not a fan of bitter greens. So my dislike is personal taste and not food related.   Now for the cons. The service was incredibly slow. We had to wait 20 minutes to be seated even though the restaurant appeared to be able to accommodate more patrons. I get it, sometimes there isn't enough staff to cover the entire restaurant. Nevertheless, once we were seated it took a little bit of time for the server to greet our table and take drink orders. Once drinks were ordered and brought out we were ready to place the rest of our order. At this point is when the service really falls off. It took a long time for anything to be brought to the table. In all fairness we were told that the pizza takes a little longer-- no problem. Well, the Beet Salad came out. Then my son's chicken wings; the my wife's sandwich, then my pizza (which was supposed to take a little longer) then after an even longer wait-- my daughter's chicken Caesar salad.   The server didn't come back to the table to ask if everything was ok. If the server did return to the table we would have ordered mac & cheese for my daughter and get drink refills. In some restaurants if you can get the attention of another server, they will either help you, or go get the server for your table. I made eye contact with and motioned to two different servers-- both looked away and kept walking.   Overall the food is very good-- expensive for the portions-- and the service was not good at all. A final thought, hopefully there will be a few more tv's in the bar as well. Depending where you sit at the table, you may have your back to the screens."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the homemade mozzarella. We had the Brussels sprouts which are amazing. We are definitely coming back! The chefs board was really interesting and fun. The beer was great too!   Since we enjoyed our experience so much we went back. This time sitting outside. Service was awful. We were ignored. We had to keep going up to bar to order. Servers walked right by without stopping.  Spoke with friends that had the same experience and walked out.  I hope they get this worked out because hanging outside there with friends is really fun."}
{"text":"On a Saturday night, we came in to eat around 11pm and we're sat in the bar because the other section was closed. No big deal to us. After we sat down at a table and given menus, the person who sat us, who looked to maybe be a manager, was an older gentleman, told us that they only could do pizza from the menu at this time. Then changed it to the kitchen was closed already so they couldn't make anything. I saw the hours were until 12am, with no note of when the kitchen closes. It was very unprofessional the way we were treated. We felt as if we were in the wrong for coming in an hour before closing. Would have been nice to know the kitchen closes early. I have heard nothing but good things about the food, but after that experience I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Waiter was weird. Food good, interior needs a lot of work. Friend went in at happy hour ordered Red Cab, was $9, waiter told her sorry that Cab isn't covered? Other friends don't care for it all. Maybe when they get dialed in and the brewery is up and running it will take off. Fried chicken was great! I don't envy restaurant owners, it's a major ordeal to get things clicking on all cylinders.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food. Service was fair. Atmosphere is a little loud. Might be back but not high up on the list."}
{"text":"Sat in the bar area and shared the Elotes appetizer with my hubs.  It was really good.  I also had the black bean burger with a side salad. The burger was huge and I had to bring some of it home.  The atmosphere was laid back and I would imagine this would be great place for happy hour to share some apps and drinks after work.  I look forward to returning here soon.  Good local brewery."}
{"text":"The beer was very good. I had a peach flavored beer that was very refreshing. Food was very good."}
{"text":"Was just here and I have to say that State 48 Brewery is by far THE best food establishment in the West valley. The amount of pride and care put into each dish is extremely evident and makes the food that much more delicious.  I began with the shrimp ceviche and I was so impressed with the dish that I ordered another. Whoever made this is a true food artist.  For the entreé I ordered a roasted beet salad and my boyfriend ordered a grain salad. These salads are nothing short of artwork. The precision of each ingredient being in their proper place lent to the already delicious combination of flavors from the fresh ingredients. The beets on my salad were rich and the quinoa and barley in my boyfriends salad melded so well with each other.  Following our delicious main course we ordered desserts. I had the creme bruleé which was absolutely gorgeous. Once again the attention to detail was evident. And the creme bruleé itself was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the \"smokin smores\". We weren't sure what to expect, but when it arrived it was as artistic as it was delicious. We opened the jar and out came a cloud of sweet smelling smoke! A definite shock, you must purchase to understand.  Overall the restaurant is beautiful. Will be coming here often."}
{"text":"Great food. Prices are a bit high for some items but reasonable for the food quality. Good beer. My biggest complaint is the service. They are a bit slow at times"}
{"text":"LOVE THEM!!!!!! Get the pizza...they make their own cheese. great place"}
{"text":"Had dinner recently and discovered that it is just a bar. However the waitress did seem genuinely interested in our food and service. Will probably not visit again."}
{"text":"In love with this place, the food is always fresh and delicious. The beer selection is amazing and I love being able to do the flight so I can try new ones every time. It's become me and my boyfriends new favorite Sunday spot and the staff is helpful and knowledgeable about what they're selling and always do it with a smile"}
{"text":"The beer that these guys brew is top notch! The bartenders are helpful and knowledgeable about their different styles of beers! I haven't had their food yet, so when i do, ill add to this review."}
{"text":"Waited 1.5 hours for a table on a Friday night.  Noticed at least 10 empty tables we could have been seated at.  Finally got seated...and ordered beer flights.  Took 15 minutes to get our flights..and 2 of the beers were wrong.  We brought it to the waiters attention..and he infact wrote the right beers down..but the bartender messed them up.  We asked for the beers that we ordered...and our server tried to get the bartender to fix it.  Instead of fixing it...they only gave us a sip of each beer instead of the regular flight size glass.  Stupid.  Then...we proceeded to wait another half hour for our food.  Ordered the PB and J burger...that was so soggy..the bun fell apart.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour. Was decent selection of beers although they were out of my 1st choice. Service was slower than expected.  Bummer the venue has outdoor seating right next to such a busy noisy road. Cool place to have a drink though. Didn't try food but looked like a few good items to try next time."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great beer and usually consistently good food. Service can be hit or miss depending on your server. I think they got a new cook recently and the food hasn't been as consistent in the last month or so."}
{"text":"Ok heres the truth about this place, I have been here 3 time. Too expensive the 1 st time, too expensive the 2nd time. Too expensive the 3rd time... Place is ok overrated over priced very disappointed wouldn't recommend it and that's what I am telling others.... New place to come soon after they go outta biz!!! Sad days"}
{"text":"I went there after a ball game with a few friends. They are into small breweries and like trying different beers. I also like trying different types of beers too. They let us try a few samples and we had a great waitress too. We also order off there menu which has a lot of different items. Everything we tried was very good. I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed in this business. We arrived and we ordered a beers. Then we proceeded to order food. Or I tried to order food. I asked if I could order a kids menu item and I was immediately denied. I have a  couple of medical conditions that have caused me to have a decreased appetite. So to not even give consideration for that fact really made me upset. Fine, if you want to charge me a couple extra bucks as an adult ordering off the kids menu, fine. But to completely deny me, unacceptable!!! I will not be back.   Btws, my husband ordered their chicken wings. On the drive home he stated, \"They were very dissatisfying.\" He said they were not spicy at all. So, congrats State 48, 2 thumbs down!!! Now I can understand why you are only 3.5 stars! Congrats!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in Surprise.  We try to order something different each time we go.  The menu is seasonal, which makes it more fun.  Burgers, pizzas, Brussel sprouts, and carnitas are excellent.  However, the lemon hummus was bland (I did say I like to try new things.)  Also, the Philly is American cheesy blandness.  Their milk stout beer is excellent.  One evening we watched college football inside and let the waitress know we were planning on staying a long time and to bring food slowly.  We ordered an appetizer, then later shared a salad (the pear one is delicious!), next a pizza, and finally a dessert.  She was great and funny.  We've sat inside as well as on the patio; either is good."}
{"text":"Mosaic IPA is my favorite, food is pretty good, but sometimes fries aren't hot and not consistent between visits so not a five star review.   Several vegetarian choices keeps me going there over and over."}
{"text":"I was excited to hear that a new brewery was opening on the NW side of the Valley.  But going there on a Saturday night was a disappointment.  Granted, they've only recently opened but the food doesn't match up to their prices.  They've decided they want to sell a $12 hamburger.  It's a good size, but made of two patties - neither of which they could grill to the right temperature.  Their \"hand cut fries\" were pathetic, limp not crispy.  I had to call the server back to ask for Ketchup - kind of standard for a burger and fries.  Their \"signature\" home-made ketchup is served in a standard squeeze bottle.  It was both watery and chunky.  Attempting to squeeze some on my plate found a chunk trapped in the nozzle.  When I finally squeezed hard enough to dislodge it I had a deluge on my plate which splattered me, the table and my dining companion.  Too soon to have their own beers on tap they had over 30 tap handles from other Arizona Breweries."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! It's definitely our favorite place to bring family or friends from out of town! I love the pb&j burger. All the appetizers are amazing. Best drinks ever! I love that they are always adding new drinks to the menu! All the waitresses we have had are great! Outside seating is so awesome! I love that you can bring dogs and they have games to play. Only complaint would be that my prosciutto on my pizza last time was inedible on 90% of the edges. It definitely wasn't trimmed correctly which after having to go through a meal and spitting out so much of my food, it made me go from a perfect 5 star to a 4."}
{"text":"Food is hit and miss, beer is mediocre to pretty good, service is a definite miss. To be fair I think it's just lack of training and for that I blame the owner. He does not seem to comprehend customer service. He will stand and watch his staff struggle with unhappy patrons then he will send in an untrained 'manager' to attempt to resolve complaints. I have been here at least 4 times and never had a problem free experience.   After a disastrous failed attempt to attend a Celebration of Life, which we had a reservation for, I will never return. Our large party left-we had no choice as they said we did not inform them of the number of people that would be attending, they weren't sufficiently staffed and we were 10 minutes early. What? I went in person 4 days in advance and spoke to a 'manager' and told them the # of people and what time we would be there. As we were 'early' we would have waited the 10 minutes but then they proceeded to tell us if we just drink and don't order food they couldn't guarantee service. Again, what?  Our large party walked in to Brookside II right down the street and we were welcomed with open arms, excellent service, despite only 1 server on duty,  and much better food than I have ever had at State 48. Thank you Chelsea at Brookside! I also highly recommend the pretzels and cheese dip at Brookside-amazing!  After I posted a review on a local FB page the owner deleted the post, blocked me then messengered me blaming me for their mistakes and trying to make excuses for the entire fiasco. Keep in mind he knew we had just come from a viewing of a beloved family member.   Read the reviews here on Yelp & Trip Advisor. The inconsistencies in food and service are a pattern.  If they hired a manager with a background in F&B, spent some time and money hiring and training their staff there would be hope for this place. Until that happens I cannot recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Went on Friday for a holiday party. Had their flavored monitor which was interesting. Had a second one to make sure I liked it. The fish and chips were pretty good. We're going to need to go back to see what other items on the menu are like. Our waiter was friendly and pretty helpful as well."}
{"text":"This place is the best. It's ambiance is awesome. Food is always a 5 star with great prices for amazing good. Can't wait to go back. Wish it was closer to my home. I would dine there and drink there all the time :)  Mary Lynn"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but I  have been here three times and they have made the same mistake every time... they bring out my pizza before the rest of the tables food...and I mean way before...like I was finished with my pizza before my party even got their food. This is totally unacceptable, and very awkward for everyone at the table. You guys really need to fix this."}
{"text":"Great food! The atmosphere is nothing like what you would think! Awesome outside patio area. The staff is really friendly. I love the place. A must visit!!!"}
{"text":"I love my Cali style pizzas; and dang The Brussels sprout bacon pizza was on fire!! Confused me on menu and I asked the bartender and he told me YES BRUSSELS on pizza!! Psssssshhh say no more my goood friend lets roll with that one!!  Will come here for that pizza and the US-60 stout... I am a happy cali camper"}
{"text":"Well, we really wanna like this place cause we love Craft beer, but the last couple of times the customer service has been mediocre. Our server once we were sat was great but when we arrived we wanted to hang outside and play Cornhole. There was no one outside playing and when I asked the hostess, she said all the bags were checked out. She suggested I ask someone if they are playing. Well, that's not really my place and I have no idea who has them. She didn't offer to help. I asked another girl outside and she also did not bother to help. Just a lack of care for us at all. Also, not a place for sports and it is really loud. Better off going across the street to Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Surprise has needed a place like this for some time. Food was good, but the local beer and wine selection and ambiance made the entire experience fantastic. We'll be back many, many times!   After multiple returns to state 48.. I must confess it is not what I hoped it would turn out to be. The food is very much ok but far too expensive. Ultimately this is an ok place to drink or spend a happy hour but not worthwhile for the food."}
{"text":"Thais place is a definite beer goers place, great variety of beers. Not crazy about the appetizers but the veggie burger was delicious. Great meet up spot for friends catching up."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner with my husband yesterday. Decorations seemed ok, was thinking that it should have more AZ decors. The waitress didn't ask us if it was our first time there or recommend beer which would have been nice. We ordered the pretzels and wished that there were more pretzels instead of the three or maybe bigger pretzels. Cheese sauce was good. Burger was ok, a little dry even though we requested some pink. We were excited about this brewery opening up in Surprise since there aren't any breweries, but we felt that it wasn't really a restaurant where we would be excited to go back to. Maybe things will get better since it did just open."}
{"text":"stopped in for lunch. had a brown-noser beer and a po' boy. very good. nice place. good wait staff."}
{"text":"Great experience at this brewery! Service was great and the food was amazing. I especially liked the roasted corn and fried cauliflower dish. I can tell that the owner put a lot of effort in making the brewery have great ambience. I had the mango beer which was refreshing and new. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"All the meals were good!  And the beers were good.  Great service.  Nice atmosphere--casual.  Can't wait to go back for the third time."}
{"text":"Wow, what a surprise. I stopped when I was in town just looking for a cold tasty beer and a snack.  I left very satisfied and promising the head brew master (who stopped and asked how I liked his beer, chuck I think?) that I would be back soon."}
{"text":"Three times a charm for me with State 48. Usually I only go back to a restraunt if it is worth going to and I didn't feel that the two times prior to the last time I went. State 48 is a brewery and a restraunt. They brew 10 of their own beers and carry several local Micro brews as well as popular out of state beer. The  house beer here is ok. I am sure their beer making skills will develop and wull onlu get better much like they have alreadu done with the food. The first few times i went the food was average. It was lacking a refinedness that brought it all togeather. I went with my wife and another couple. So I was able to try their dishes as well. This last time me and my wife went was great. We shared the Totchos which are tater-tot nachos. These are highly addictive. The pizza we ordered was their meat pizza and because they have a brick oven here they are able to get a nice crispy charred pizza out to you very quickly which goes well with a nice cold beer. Of course topped everything off with desert. The Smoking Smores is a mason jar filled with chocolate cake with gram cracker melted marshmallows and vanilla ice cream. It is a show stopper. We were both satisfied with this last visit and am looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Disappointed in my visit as I live in the area and looking for a great place to hang out and drink. Service wasn't that great. I might try it again but it won't be soon."}
{"text":"Tried this place out today. Walked in and didn't know what they were aiming for (barnyard, Victorian, cowboy, ghetto sheek).  I ordered the Fried chicken the wife ordered the fish and chips. The fish and chips was fresh and delicious. The chicken batter was nice and crunchy and flavorful with the honey drizzle. Inside the batter, the chicken was flavorless (breast was dry). They could have prolly brined the chicken. The atmosphere is friendly and the staff were polite and courteous. It's a good place, just needs a bit of time to refine."}
{"text":"If you're looking for FOOD, skip this place completely. Service is very poor; the staff seem disorganized and untrained. The prices are high too; $41.00 before tip for bar food for two. And the bathroom was dirty; dusty. First time in a LONG time that I tipped only 10%. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"DELICIOUSLY DECADENT DINING IN A BAR!!! Second dining experience here at the 48 and.... WOW!!!  Chef's special burger creation: beautiful slab of medium-well beef-burger topped with bleu cheese mousse, red wine reduction, Arugula and grilled onions, side of sweet potato fries and bleu cheese dressing to dip the fries. I was going to order the White Tank Wheat to accompany the meal. However, my server, Dan, suggested the Van Buren Blonde would better compliment the richness of the bleu cheese. Man, was he right! I am having taste bud sensations for days! The richness of the bleu cheese mousse and red wine  bounces firmly against the fruity-earthy deliciousness of this blonde. A truly exciting meal for my severelyecritical pallet. This has been gourmet dining in a casual bar. Mostly unheard of, but it happened today. Personal opinion: Bleu cheese mousse is rich, for sure. However, I love rich, so I asked for a dab more. Sweet potato fries are a perfect compliment and use bleu cheese dressing for fries, both easier for dipping and so you don't lose the effect of the mousse on the burger.   Dan has been a very attentive server, kind attitude, offered great suggestions and made sure my meal was tasty and glass was always full."}
{"text":"We've been several times. I am a craft beer enthusiast, we love to eat out and it's close to home. Most of the beer's I've tried I would score in the average (3.5 to 3.75 out of 5) range. The food is good; again, I'd say average to slightly above average. The service, however, has always been way above average, and good customer service is usually the factor that distinguishes average from above average for me.    On my most recent trip I ordered the Hell Bitch \"Belgian Tripel.\" I love Belgian beers and the tripel is one of my favorite styles of beer, so I was excited to see it on the list. I'll be polite. They have a lot of good beers here - this is definitely not one of them. It doesn't really resemble a Belgian Tripel. I know the BJCP Guidelines are just that... \"guidelines\"... but you should at least attempt to hit some of the criteria.    The only other downside that dropped a star off for me is their \"follow-the-crowd\" mentality about catering to the \"dogs are people too\" nuts. It would be nice to sit on the patio and enjoy dinner and a few beers without the humane society kennel-like atmosphere. I love animals as much as the next guy and I've been a dog owner my entire adult life. Dogs are dogs... people are people..."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and every time we go we have a great time. The pretzels are a good appetizer and the pizzas are delish! Beer is cold and the staff has a really good knowledge of what they have and are eager to suggest different things to try. The atmosphere is really chill and the patio is huge. I've heard some people have had some issues with the food, but we have had multiple items and they have always come out great. We will definitely continue to frequent this place! Great job!"}
{"text":"Appetizers were good, as was service. Lots of local beer choices. Good atmosphere. Did not have dinner so will comment next time."}
{"text":"Your best bet is to sit at the bar because the service is much quicker as the servers seem a bit overwhelmed every time we've been there. Saying that Janine and Ryan have been our servers a few times and they're very friendly and do the best they can as they seem understaffed.  The apple and brie bruchetta was wonderful,,  if only it was on the menu all of the time. The meat loaf was OK but the potatoes were hardly warm and tasted old. We really enjoy the appetizers but the meals are hit or miss. The big negative is the bartenders prices are all over the place for mixed drinks  one will charge 10 bucks for a real double and the next will charge 16 bucks for a double that is smaller than a single, so watch your prices when you drink here.  The staff is always friendly and the restaurant itself is very clean and the patio is wonderful."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night around 830.  Place was jumpin.  Found a couple chairs at the outside bar.  Nice setup.  Tons of workers.  Tons of customers.  Couple dogs, couple kids.  Pretty mixed crowd.    We ordered a couple flights of their in house beers.  One was out so we subbed it with a Nut Brown from Pine.    The food coming out of the kitchen looked pretty legit.  We ordered a pretzel app as the people next to us had one and it looked good.  The flight came out pretty quickly which was nice for how slammed they were.  Pretzels came out shortly after that.  The bartender was pretty cool and attentive to us.    The beers were disappointing overall.  A couple stood out: Blueberry Ale and  PHX Porter.  The big stick was okay but the rest weren't very good.  Not much aroma, or balance.  All of them tasted very similar.  I could barely tell them apart.  That's too bad as the rest of this place was pretty on point.  They did have quite a bit of beers not on tap from around the around the country that are pretty solid.  If I came back I'd probably stick to those.   Price was not bad.  30 bucks for a couple flights and an app is not too bad.  Would come back if I was in the area but not a highly recommend at this point.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Went a few weeks ago and the food was just ok. We paid a considerable amount for a soggy pizza and lackluster beer that tasted like bud light (I asked for a pale beer and I certainly got that) for like $12.  Our server was good but clearly new with no help, he was about as helpful decoding the menu as I was on my first time there. Like I said, the food was ok but not enough to bring me back.  Bonus points for the bubbly hostess that was very helpful once the waiter got too stressed."}
{"text":"As most NEW restaurants do, the owners and managers encourage their staff and friends to write good reviews. The reason I brought that up was because an acquaintance told me she has eaten there and is friends with an employee and was asked to write a good review. I can only assume several of the positive reviews are such.  Well, I tried it with my wife last yesterday afternoon. This restaurant used to be a Sushi restaurant, we were excited to see another restaurant come to town. The waitress was friendly and polite. I had to take a double take at the prices on the menu. $17 for chicken $30 for a steak! I thought to myself, this place is no Ruth Chris. I went with the rotisserie chicken. My wife went for a Cesar salad. When our meal arrived I couldn't  have been more disappointed. First off, I told the server I was on a no carb diet, she recommended the rotisserie chicken. It was covered in barbecue sauce, WTH? My wife said just scrape it off and remove the skin. It was supposed to be a half of chicken. \"It was a complete joke\" Miniature chicken or game hen, either way it was only a small leg & thigh. The sever asked how was everything? I replied, wasn't this supposed to be a half of chicken? She said, \"yes but they a very small birds\" About five minutes pass and the manager came over and defended the miniature chicken. He said, they do use a very small bird and he ask the cook if he made a mistake and not cut the chicken in half. He assured me, I got half of the bird. Trust me, I know chicken, that wasn't half,  I'm not a big fan of white meat, I usually take it home and use it for a salad.  Anyway, he apologized and comped my $17 leg and thigh.  I can honestly say the $5.99 whole rotisserie chicken Fry's sells has better flavor and is worth every penny. Compared to their recipe, Fry's, Safeway, Bashas's and Walmart do a better job.  The brew was good and priced competitively. They offer happy hour before 6pm $2.00 off each beer and appetizer. If we go back, and that is a \"BIG IF\" that is all we'll go back for. The dinner is extremely overpriced, small portions and flavorless."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  There are so many chain restaurants in the Surprise area, and we found it difficult to find a place that served real food.  This place his the spot and it has a great atmosphere to boot!  My husband loves the beer selection and I love the variety from burgers, to fish and fantastic salads, you really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Don't tell you that pizza isn't available till 4. Out of chicken sandwich and cod had bones. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Well let start by saying that this place is amazing. Great choices of beer and food! Mario is a genius. I had the beet salad, Diablo pizza, chef's board, antipasti salad and pretzel plate, all delicious. Great place and we will come back."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! Great food ( they have vegetarian options!!) and an awesome selection of beer. The service is outstanding - We had Justin helping us and he was great! He always made sure we were taken care of and he offered some delicious selections of craft beers! I'm very pleased with the service! We will definitely be back - highly recommend trying this place out! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Awesome local spot! Delicious beer and great food! Love the pizza! The atmosphere is fun even though it's next to a busy street. You definitely don't notice it after a beer or two ;-) haven't had a bad experience here. My family and I truly want to support a local business like this because we need more around here (less chain restaurants please!!!) and we definitely do not want to see a place like this fail. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Okay, their beers were good! I had beer cheese burger and it was delicious, my boyfriend had the meatloaf melt and it was almost inedible. Service was good!"}
{"text":"State 48 has such a great atmosphere. Whether you're coming in to sit at the bar and try some of their amazing house brews, wanting to enjoy the patio bar while playing corn-hole, or looking for a nice sit down dinner, this is the right place!"}
{"text":"Utterly disappointed, their beer selection, although vast, is poor.  Ordered pretzels with \"beer cheese\" and what showed up for a party of 4 for $8 was 3 tiny pretzel sticks and valveeta with rotel canned tomatoes.  I ordered a pizza with what is billed as seasoned Italian beef but was cheap overcooked skirt steak.  I felt so ripped off paying a $50 tab for me and my girlfriend, but this seems to be common with most new breweries that are popping up."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I'm very impressed. The food was really good. I had the State 48 Burger and it was excellent. I also had the White Tank Wheat and the Mango Wheat. Both were really good but the Mango was DELICIOUS!!! Plus, $2 off State 48 beers till 5pm on a Saturday is a bonus. I also want to give our server Nikki props. She was attentive and friendly. I could go on but I won't. I will be back."}
{"text":"Had the beer cheese burger, pretzels with beer cheese and pumpkin creme brûlée. Also they let us try a few beers for free. Everything was amazing. I had the blueberry ale. It was amazing. Definitely will become a regular there."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, even as carryout. Unfortunately the service has been very slow the two times I've visited. Carryout order on a non-busy time took 25 minutes for cheese burgers."}
{"text":"Been to state 48  4 times each time I tried something new every time it has a real good the booths in the bar are very uncomfortable but the food is great and the service is great. Love playing corn hole."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  I had the carnitas sandwich with side salad.  I had the basil balsamic dressing.  Enough to share but I didn't.  That dressing was wonderful with a little kick.  The sandwich was delicious.  My daughter got the turkey Reuben.  We split both  sandwiches.  I liked that one too but the carnitas was best.  So many things I want to try.  The side she got was the slaw.  It was good but needed salt.  The price was about $12 I think.  It was worth it.  I will return and try the fish and chips next time.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Went back two nights ago. Still good. Tried the pizza amongst other things. Pizza is good. I hope they make it as I assume rent must be pretty high in that location and the size of the building leads one to think it is a premium priced location. It is a nice addition to Surprise."}
{"text":"Been back a few times now hoping it would get better. No such luck. The final time I tried to order the porkchop and had to send it back 3 times as it was RAW. The manager said I ordered it wrong (I ordered medium, it was frickin' RAW). Third time it came back it was well done on the outside and still rare and cold inside. She did take it back and give me something else but my wife had finished her dinner 20 minutes ago and the meatloaf wasn't worth all that trouble. Beers are still really good but I just won't go back for food ever again."}
{"text":"This place won't make it. Waited 15 min when it was dead for a server to greet us at the table."}
{"text":"We had a group of 8 and we were placed in a secluded private room which was AWESOME! We were able to close the doors and be able to dine it with great service! I had The chicken Caesar salad ( I know not that special ) but I'm very picky with my Caesar salads and this was delicious!!! DEFINITELY try the s'mores dessert. It's a brownie with melted marshmallows surrounding it with crumbs of graham crackers and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I can literally come back JUST for that dessert LOL! Awesome beer selections and wine ( I had the moscato ) thanks Again State 48!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good beer and delicious food! We sat at the outside bar, there was corn hole and additional seating. The service was speedy and the bartenders were friendly! The staff works as a team and service flows so well.  The building is too cool and very unique I definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Server was excited about her job. Very friendly and outgoing and loves the food here. The atmosphere is s bit odd....the main bar area is still the same as the previous restaurant ... Dark and dreary with uncomfortable booths ... Seats are broken down....the main restaurant area has some nice features and then some ugly features. Nothing works together....old glass tile from previous restaurant with etched glass inserts, cow hid booths and wood tables feel like old west, graffiti wall and long bar table feel like LA, industrial look, haunted house feel lighting and tables and chairs. Just crazy combinations. Could've used an experts touch!  Food- the beet salad was AMAZING!! The shrimp ceviche was great .. Chia that it's served with are AWESOME. Fish and chips good... Not a fan of the \"fancy sauce\" and fries nothing great. Burger was ok also had \"fancy suace\" definitely not a fan. The homemade ketchup too runny don't recommend.  Overall we will be back hopefully they make a few changes. Staff very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"If I could rate State 48 based on potential, this review would be much higher. This restaurant calls itself a brewery but unfortunately did not have any house brews on hand. The selection of beer on tap was ok, but nothing amazing. A gose or sour beer would have been nice to see, and perhaps a true blonde or something else light.   We began by drinking. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were attentive. We sampled quite a few beers before deciding. I had the Pedal Haus witbier, $3 (normally $5), which was good. My husband had the BRI Danger Noodle Belgian ($5, normally $7), which was VERY good. It was 110 outside and I wanted a light beer, so the wit was a good choice.   We ordered the Chefs Board, the charcuterie  plate($16- extraordinarily overpriced for what we received, but not for what was advertised). This was a huge disappointment. It was advertised as a selection of meats, cheeses, nuts, vegetables, jams and mustards. What we received was essentially a salad on a board. The meat was fine- some salami, a prosciutto, something that resembled pork belly perhaps. Our server should have reviewed the items on the board, but they did not, which was a disappointment. There were only 2 cheeses- a bleu and a Romano. There were no nuts. No olives. No mustard. The one jam was probably apricot, and was not that great. There was a giant pile of arugula in the middle of the board, which made no sense. In this pile were some tomatoes and a few grapes that tasted like they had been soaked in cider. There were also some soggy strips of red bell pepper on top. They could take some ideas from The Arrogant Butcher's charcuterie board for some ideas on how to make this a good option.   At this point we decided we had tried enough. Since it was happy hour, our drinks were $2 off (hence the pricing above), making this a place I would return to in the future. Hopefully they will have house brew on tap somewhat soon and maybe I'll try some more of the food at that point."}
{"text":"Since my last review my husband and I have been back 3 more times. We love this brewery! It's our go to spot for great tasting food and brew!! We have tried the food since our first visit and here is what we have tried. From 3-6 M-F happy hour 2 dollars off appetizers so on one occasion we ordered the pretzels and beer cheese, as well as the seasonal Bruschetta. The pretzels were decent but would probably be better if they came as pretzel bites instead of three sticks. They would look better and look like there was more to share. Other than that it tasted pretty good. The Bruschetta was spot on and we loved it! We had the crispy apple burger which is not on the menu and was listed as a special. That burger was flippin' delicious! The fries are good as well. On our last visit we tried the Hawaiian pizza which again was the special of the day. The wood fire pizza is soooo good! (Tip: not good after you heat it up again) eat it fresh! We met the master brewer while we were there and he suggested his special mix of beer which was the blueberry ale and the vortex ( hopefully I remembered that correctly) just ask for Chucks mix and they should know what you are talking about. The service was outstanding as well!"}
{"text":"It is sweltering in here. Loud anyway and then a \"jazz type\" band on the patio sooo noisy we can't have a conversation. The copper top tables STINK like a pile of old pennies. Very unappetizing. This place is good in cooler months when you can sit outside but sitting inside with the wide open to outside bar is impossible to get cool."}
{"text":"Food was very good, beer was too but the service left much to be desired.  Slow, disorganized, not paying attention to the customers."}
{"text":"Mixed reviews. Came in a month ago and would have given 4.5/5 stars. Awesome bartenders, awesome food. This afternoon was not so great. Poor service, unenthusiastic bartender, food was still good but the quality has changed (ex. Fries come with beer ketchup; previously on your plate, today in a big watered down bottle). Usually it's the opposite -- poor startup but things improve over time-- so I'm not sure where to go from here and it's disappointing as a brewery they STILL don't have their own beers on tap."}
{"text":"Waited forever for our food then it was barely warm when it came out. Those who ordered pizza were served and finished eating before the rest of us got food. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place for happy hour. Their buffalo cauliflower wings are amazing. Servers are friendly and they love teachers so I will go there even more often."}
{"text":"At 4 pm on Saturday it was crowded so we expected a wait. Seemed a bit unorganized but that's ok. What wasn't ok was the food. We ordered the tuna appetizer after we tried to order the pretzel, but were told that they ran out of beer cheese and all the menu items with that cheese were not being served. The tuna was bad. No other way to put it. It was the worst we have ever had and we sent it back. We ordered 2 pizzas, one was to be the mushroom and one 3 ingredient (sausage, mushroom cheese). Time for a beer. No, wait. None of their own beer? Pizza arrives and the mushroom pizza came out as a cheese pizza, or, as the other was to prove, maybe they just forgot to put the ingredients on it. The sausage and mushroom pizza had about 7 small pieces of sausage and very few mushrooms, I have a picture to prove it. And it was $17.00! So, none of their own beer and each item we ordered was wrong or inedible. We never send back food but had to here. The ladies at the next high top table waited at least 30 minutes to have their drink order taken. When our pizzas we brought out, the guy couldn't figure out whos they were. Most of the staff were overwhelmed by the crowd. Our waitress was good. She ordered our selections correctly so we did tip her as we normally would have. Not her fault that the place is under staffed and not trained well. No silverware at the table, we had to get up and ask for it, no condiments at the table and none were offered. And its really loud. Most chain places are better. I hate to say that but its true. The area needs this type of place so this is very disappointing. We wont be back."}
{"text":"Not sure why it took this long to try State 48, especially since I am anti-chain restaurant, but finally made it in tonite and will definitely be back.   We were seated right away on the pizza oven side of the restaurant. The bar side sounded a little more exciting but we were fine where we were. Our server Nicki was great. As soon as we ordered wine and not beer, she ran to get us a couple samples of their craft beer. One blueberry and one raspberry. They were very good. I am a much bigger fan of wine so I stuck with my original choice but wouldn't completely dismiss the idea of ordering a craft beer in the future.   Husband and I each had pizza. One Diavolo and one Meatball. Both were very good with fresh ingredients. I enjoyed watching the pizzas be hand tossed before they were crafted and fired. One warning...if you can't handle spicy, do not go with the Diavolo!!   As much as we wanted to try dessert, we had our fill with the pizza. In fact there was plenty of pizza to take home. Next time I may just go for dessert and I might even try some sort of coffee beer that Nicki recommended. She really was great!!  Lastly, what made the experience tonite complete was the Manager (Mario) stopping by our table to make sure everything was to our satisfaction.   Already planning our next visit. See you soon, State 48!!"}
{"text":"Great food great service!! The atmosphere is really rustic and chic!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"A safe choice if you're looking for a solid beer selection and good food. They have many of their own brews and guest beers on tap, basically every style you'll find something you like. A lot of food options, I went with the hot Italian sandwich. Sandwich was good, fries meh (almost shoestring, just too thin and crunchy for my liking).  The setup is different in a good way, decent sized bar and some outdoor seating. Friendly hostess and waitress, but service could use some work. It wasnt busy when I was there, took awhile to get the first round of beers and to place a food order.  Worth a trip if you're in the area or simply enjoy checking out AZ breweries."}
{"text":"On our arrival in Surprise, it was late and we couldn't find many places that were still open for dinner.  We checked Yelp, and found State 48.  I had amushroom burger, and my traveling companion had the AZ salad.  Each was very good.  Over the next week we returned to State 48 several times.  We tried a couple of different burgers (the beer cheese burger was super), and nearly all of the salads (the grilled romaine wedge and the aforementioned AZ salad were great).  The meatloaf was very good and very large -- we should have split it!   I liked the IPAs.  The service was very good.  Though it was a little noisy one night, it was lively and pleasant on all the others.  State 48 Brewery was a great find for us during our stay in Surprise.    Our only disappointment was that they ran low on t-shirts in the right size.  My traveling companion thought one would have made a great nightshirt!"}
{"text":"I've only heard mediocre reviews about this place but had to try it for myself. They were right - food was \"good\" but nothing special, beer was fine but forgettable. Environment was confusing, their theme is all over the place. Nice spot to check out once but I doubt I'll return, just too basic."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday night; nice crowd. Our server Jason was amazing! Good local beer and the Sloppy Cornbread and Brussel Sprouts were delicious. I'll be coming by again when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and so many beers to choose from. Great friendly staff great all around experience."}
{"text":"First visit and will not go back.  Walking to the bath room you would be lucky to make it without falling, the floors were greasy and disgusting, and when I told the hostess about it, she said if I had the power to change it I would......WHAT??  I said you do have the power  go tell your manager...she said that there was not manager there and the owner wasn't there either.  I asked again to see a manager and she made a face at me, and went the back ...Someone who claimed to be the front of the house manager came and gave me nothing but excuses and told me she would be happy to talk to me about it with an attitude that was just as disgusting as the floors.    Food was disappointing as well.  If they continue with this pattern, they will be closed soon.   Bad!!"}
{"text":"Get Shelby easily the best server in the valley, she really honestly gets it. If I had restaurant I would try to steal her away. Amazing service!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazing! The PB&J burger with marshmellow fluff.  Nikki was awesome!  Ask for her!#"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, food was fabulous!  Can't rate the beer as I don't drink it but my husband found one he liked."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service on the other hand wasn't. I ordered a Royale with Cheese and it was exactly what I expected. A decent burger for a decent price, with average fries. I got an iced tea to drink, no idea why I didn't get a beer, but it took two reminders for the server to finally get it to me. And when I asked for a refill, I waited and waited but it never came.   And as for my friend's order, simple Fish N Chips (who ordered first), we needed to remind her to bring out his plate. The restaurant was empty, but we were not checked on once.   We needed to ask for refills for our waters, a couple of times I might add.  I believe they had good intentions, but this restaurant lacks decent customer service."}
{"text":"Beeeeeer cheeeeeeese. That is all.  My husband and I frequent this place because of the beer selection and delicious grub. Staff is always friendly. So nice to have a brewery on the West Side"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect, but we ended up pleasantly surprised! Everything we ordered was DELICIOUS! The fish tacos are more like an appetizer, with 3 street-taco sized portions. Though small, they were really really good. We couldn't decide on the burger as they all sounded good, so our waitress recommended her favorite - the PB&J burger. We would have NEVER ordered it on our own, but we are so glad we listened to her! I don't know how they make a burger with peanut butter and a savory jelly taste good, but they did and did it perfectly! But the all star of our meal was actually the FRIES. Y'all... I could've eaten an entire plate all by myself! I will crave these fries for weeks - I just know it! And the biggest surprise for us was that this place is kid friendly (has a kids menu), so we will DEFINITELY be coming back! Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Been there 3 times and never had a GREAT experience, food was just so so, but last night made my family and I decide it wasn't worth another trip ever again. We went on a Tuesday night, not busy at all. We ordered a couple cheeseburgers, a wrap, and fish and chips and were left waiting for an hour and a half for our food. The waitress was super sweet about it and offered to discount our food 25%, but then when she brought the bill she said she could only get 20% taken off. Don't promise something if you can't deliver. The manager helped her bring out our meal, laughed about how she needed to learn to cook faster, which I just felt like she was passing it off as a joke. I kind of have a feeling that they forgot to put in the order because other people that were seated after us got their food and left before we even got our meal, but who can say. Food was dry and they gave me the last tiny bits of French fries, and even said that she knew it was a bad idea but did it anyway. She did bring out a new order of fries which were good. Just kind of a blah meal. Not worth a trip."}
{"text":"Posting my review after three visits. Yes, this is a brewery that has none of their own beer ready. That's OK because it takes time and the City of Surprise has been making things difficult (so I heard).  The beer they have on tap is good and includes local IPA's (thanks for having Dragoon IPA) and sours. I understand that the sours ran out quick so that tells me that Surprise has proper beer drinkers. I did manage to share cheese cake and beeramisu and both were very good. I look forward to trying out the Ribeye and other dishes. Great happy hour prices so I think I might become a regular. Hopefully their own beer will be as good as the other local beer they have on tap."}
{"text":"We loved the food and my son, JP Lanigan, who is a Bar Manager in San Francisco, said the beer was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Tried State 48 for the first time last night. Started off with a Huss Husstler beer on tap... So good!!!!!! I will be back for that alone! My husband and I shared the pretzels and beer cheese fondue with IPA mustard. The pretzels were warm and soft on the inside and the cheese was beyond amazing. My husband was especially surprised by the mustard. He cleaned the bowl. My meal was the state 48 burger. Two beef patties, bacon onion jam, Gouda cheese, oven dried tomato and arugula on a brioche bun. I could've had the bacon onion jam on the bun and been completely happy, but the burger was amazing and I would definitely have it again. I also had the house made potato chips. I really like the potato chips because they were not over seasoned at all. Sometimes you can get these and they are way too salty. My husband had the fish and chips. I'm not sure he would say they were the best fish and chips he's ever had but he cleaned his plate and loved every bite. We followed up dinner with dessert. We had the chocolate crème brûlée and the strawberry cheesecake. It's hard to choose which was my favorite but I think I'm going to go with the crème brûlée. My husband did ask for a cup of coffee with dessert and they said it would be at least eight minutes before it would be ready so he chose not to order the coffee. We did have one little issue with the burger when it arrived. The owner/manager was at our table within minutes offering to make a new burger. I didn't feel I needed that. Point being he was more than happy to do whatever it took to make the situation right. I told him I was happy and that was not needed. When I received my bill I noticed that he had completely comped my burger and sides. This shows class and in my opinion great customer service. I would in no way hesitate to recommend State 48 to anyone. We had a great meal and we will be back soon. Can't wait until they start serving their own brew! And thanks to Cheyenne A. for being an excellent server!"}
{"text":"Such a fun atmosphere and pizza is delicious. Glad to have a different place to go to in surprise. Friendly staff and fun bartender. Also love the outside seating."}
{"text":"This was an average place. Nothing special.  We had to wait for a table when there was clearly seating available. The decor was nice but didn't have cohesiveness.  The pretzel appetizer was the best thing we ate. The cheese fondue tasted like what I can buy from the grocery store.  I ordered the fish po'bouy the fish was good, it is just cod. The homemade chips were good. I ate all those. My husband had the beer cheeseburger which many reccommended.  One patty was almost burnt the other patty was perfect.  It wasn't any special beef but it was plenty of food. The fries were warm at best.  To say the least we won't be back there are better places to eat at in Surprise"}
{"text":"We've visited State 48 Brewery several times now and each time has been a completely different experience.   The first visit was for brunch. We arrived right at 9AM for brunch on Saturday and the staff acted surprised to see us, which is funny because their website says Weekend Brunch 9AM-1PM.  We were seated and a server was rounded up for us. We enjoyed the cinnamon rolls for the table and as we were a larger group, enjoyed pretty much one of each thing on the brunch menu. It was all tasty but the service was clumsy because I guess they forgot that they serve brunch. Other patrons came in during that time so it wasn't like they were just accommodating us.   The next time we came, I brought my kids for brunch. My littlest doesn't care for biscuits so I asked if we could replace his biscuit for toast instead. The server said sure but then tried to charge me for the toast on my bill. We had to practically beg for refills and our food was cold. Our server seemed very put out when we sent the food back but I refuse to eat cold eggs and I shouldn't have to be made to feel like I'm inconveniencing someone in the process.   The third time we came was for dinner. Another time of begging for refills. I had the Autumn salad and husband had the Royale with Cheese. The salad was tasty but the burger had to be sent back twice. Just because he likes it well done doesn't mean it should be a hockey puck. The server was attentive and apologetic but even he didn't seem to get what well done meant.   The servers don't seem to be trained properly and seem confused when you ask for something outside of what's precisely written on the menu listing. The restaurant itself is kinda dirty. Twice I've noticed food jammed into the booth creases and the bathrooms are dusty. The food tastes good but as I've said in previous reviews, dining out is the about all 3 elements-service, ambiance, and food. 2 of those 3 elements are just meh here. I hope that it gets better because Surprise deserves a place like State 48 wants to be. I hope it gets there."}
{"text":"Have been here at least 30 times and tried just about all of the items on the menu. Really wanted to love this place but I'm done with it. The bar has oddly placed TV sets that are a bit difficult to see, and the exterior bar offers an obstructed view of the inside due to a poorly placed pipe along the bar taps. Service is hit and miss in the food is mediocre yet overpriced."}
{"text":"We've been watching this place transform from the previous Japanese restaurant for months and we're excited to finally try it.  First impression:  Still looks like the prior place as you enter - was hoping for some \"wow!\" factor with all the hype they've been putting out.  I should have known the mediocrity would continue.  No house brews...another month.  Bummer.  Server couldn't talk much about the beer menu they do have and I ended up stuck with a beer I didn't care for.  She checked to see if I liked it, but didn't offer to change it when I told her it wasn't awesome.    For a starter, we ordered the beer cheese fondue and pretzels.  The fondue was SO good!  But, we still had half a bowl left when we ran out of pretzels.  Bummer.   Dinner was fried chicken for me and fish n chips for the hubs.  The fried chicken would have been amazing with the introduction of a little salt to the recipe, had fries instead of coleslaw because that came with hubby's meal and the sloppy cornbread is super yummy!  Hubby's fish and chips were nothing exciting at all - no flavor (perhaps a little salt again?) the coleslaw was also bland, and a little on the warm side.  Inconsistent is the best word to describe the food - it was either amazingly flavorful or fell completely flat.    The service is also inconsistent - some servers were very interactive and knowledgeable, others not.  I also didn't see any management on the floor keeping an eye on things.  I'd think with a new restaurant, someone would want to be ensuring quality of service and food.  It's a new place, so I think with a little time and attention and a few tweaks it could become the hot spot I think it wants to be."}
{"text":"On a business trip. Very close to many hotels within walking distance.  Good wings and great service from the bartender Stephanie."}
{"text":"Decent laid-back atmosphere with a nice menu selection. Enjoyed the casual brewery-esque deco & the spacious, open layout where it did not feel too crowded and there was decent space between tables/parties. Tv screens mounted frequently throughout & with non-neck-straining views if one is interested in whatever viewing attraction is displayed (sports). Complaint: music level. Too loud to easily hear or carry on a conversation. Had to literally speak an octave higher (slightly shout) to converse with someone less than 3 feet away. Turn it down a notch so one can hear their company, not to mention the staff!   I don't enjoy beer. But my friend really enjoyed one of the house brews on special. Seems the beer is what brings people back, because the food was filling enough, at best. Somewhat unique- but nothing I would intentionally be eager to return for.   After learning most everything on the menu including pickles means SWEET pickles (I don't mind them- but many do), that narrowed selection down for my friend, who really wanted the fish & chips. Their house made tartar is sweet- sorry, but even I cannot get on board with that. A TRUE tartar contains dill. So he went with the salmon filet on a bed of some sort of emphasized rice pilaf. I think we got stuck on our waitress asking \"how did you want that cooked?\" ...Uhm- it is FISH!!! What do you mean, HOW?! We were both miffed & managed to say, \"please make sure it is done- as in cooked.\" Fish is NOT steak!!! You go to a SUSHI restaurant for \"rare\" fish!   Needless to say- the plate came out & it was a portion less than what you'd receive paying $50+ a plate at a 5 star establishment for \"gourmet\"... the filet was less than 4oz on a 1/4 cup amount of rice. Friend said the rice had 0 flavor. The 5 sprigs of \"steamed\" asparagus was like chewing on wood (I heard the crunch over the loud music) & the salmon was about the best part- but only the crust contained flavor while the rest flaked pretty bland. And this was \"worth\" $17.   We had high hopes in the unique 'Brussels & Bacon' pizza I ordered. I wanted the fish tacos- but they only are served as an appetizer. Was not going to pay $12 for that then have to fork out an extra $2-3 for a side. Make it a meal. People who want tacos want more than a \"bite\". And I'm from Alaska- so don't pass it off with price as 'Alaskan Cod' when we know cod is bottom of the barrel, even in Alaska, where salmon & halibut are the true picks. Nothing about cod makes it more special, and Alaska is offended you use it's name to price gouge mediocre fish we don't even claim to fame.   The pizza did not disappoint. Generous amount of Brussels. But the bacon was pretty weak. Corn was of plenty- I love corn- but paid for bacon on the pizza, not cheap corn as a filler. Crust was on par & pretty much made it, as overall, the flavor was a bit bland. But, that is what happens when you skimp on the salted bacon that is supposed to round out the dish & flavor.   I passed on desert- but had a bite of the creme brûlée my friend ordered. The waitress, while she was attentive & tried very hard- could not remember which version of the desert was on the menu. We were told it was supposed to be strawberry. Thought it tasted funny & was rather brown... to find out it was actually some rendition of a chocolate almond or something along the lines of what tasted \"burnt\", in my opinion. I passed after one bite. Friend was not too thrilled but ate it. Waitress apologized- but I guess it was a little disappointing not being provided the correct menu when choosing & spending was not the greatest way to end the experience.   I would give it a second chance. There are other items/beverages I would like to try that have piqued my interest. And I really did enjoy the atmosphere & close location- seems like there is more potential to be discovered. And I will add- I sincerely appreciate a place that offers samples of their beers before having to order & not know! Excellent in offering samples of their brews- and they also seem to have excellent knowledge. I found it pretty cool to see a peek inside the brewery in the back upon entering/exiting on the side of the building where there are glass windows to the brew room."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good! We were placed in the back room where the windows view Bell Rd. Overhead coolers were leaking and spewing water all over the place. Water on the ground, food on the ground. WOW, what a mess. Waiter first & then waitress, couldn't care less if we were there. A couple of our orders were wrong or incomplete & one order DIDN'T get ordered from the kitchen at all! We were a party of (9) but we weren't a big drinking party. That explains it!!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice, seems like they need more staff though. Not impressed with  their Meat/Cheese  Board..... but they have great Pizza! Fun environment on the patio, and plenty of beer to choose from."}
{"text":"2 of 4 of us ordered fried chicken this Wednesday night.  Both orders were dark brown, and so over fried that the meat was dry and burnt.  There was no seasoning, or it was fried off.  Table next to us had two orders of it too, also over fried, and when we were leaving I saw orders on other tables that were the same.  They all said it as mediocre, at best.  Place has only been open a week.  They better teach the cook how to fry or they will not be around long.  Because it is a new restaurant I'll give them one more chance in a month or so to get their act together.  This is not a way to start off with so many good restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Great food, really nice outside space. Tasty beers and cocktails. Had an American IPA which is a typical mainstay of any local brewery. Really nice spot for a couple of out-of-towners for some respite from chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and sat at the bar. Bartender was friendly and offered me water and a beer. I declined the beer as I was just on a lunch break. I asked the bartender to recommend an entree and she suggested the PB&J burger. It was okay but the flavor was mottled. No real sweetness to it and nothing really spicy to draw it out. Needs to have a contrast of flavor to make it worth while. If you want a really good PB&J burger try Burger Rehab Therapy in Scottsdale.   I will try this place again when I can have the beer. The selection looked good and the bartender was knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Literally the worst experience I've ever had. Wanted to try this new brewery that everyone has been talking about and was so disappointed. My friend found cooked plastic MIXED INTO her salad and we didn't even get a sorry from our waitress Carrie. She had the worst attitude the entire time and acted like we were an inconvenience to her as she removed her salad from the bill. Also, I wouldn't recommend their salads. I had the wedge \"salad\" and it was a joke. For $10. Other than the terrible customer service, the drinks were great! If you want a great experience and a nice meal, don't come here."}
{"text":"Great new brewery in town! I had the State 48 Brown Ale and I was pleasantly surprised. It's a nutty brown ale with great flavor and a nice bite to it. Very similar to the Rogue Hazelnut Brown - which is one of my all time favorites. I also had the Buffalo Chips and they were decent - not bad - but certainly nothing to write home about. The only downside to this place is the overall vibe. The décor looks like they haven't quite figured out their style yet, so there's definitely room for improvement. If they can nail down the vibe - this place would be a huge hit in this area."}
{"text":"Server was excellent, table service was great too. Only problem was the brisket sand which was cold and plated unappetizingly. The Bun was cold too. Careless arrangement of sauce on bun and unmelted cheddar cheese. Wife's lamb burger was ordered medium and yet was delivered rare borderline raw in center and excessively gamey. We got comped for everything except our drinks and happily cut the sheets there. Most likely will not return based on questionable food quality control within kitchen management."}
{"text":"Went there twice in one day it was that good! Like all new breweries, they don't have theirs on tap yet, but they have a nice selection to choose from.  With a family of 5, I found this place affordable. I am not sure what other people want for pricing but maybe they should stick to fast food. We had the pizza, burgers, fish and chips, and everything was great. I am so excited to have a Brewery in Surprise!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Beer is great but food is amazing! Pb&j burger is one of the best I've had"}
{"text":"Solid beer with a great atmosphere. Really enjoy the brunches and the wife loves the bloody mary's.  The wood fired kitchen is a cool feature and you must get the Tatchos! Spring and fall with the roll up door on the patio can't be beat. Only reason why they are not 5 stars is that when the roll door is down it gets crazy loud inside. Come enjoy some State 48!!!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic local brewery and restaurant. They always have a great selection of their own beers in various styles and a great selection of guest beers. Any beer snob like myself will find themselves right at home. The food is also excellent no matter what you feel like eating. Don't expect pub grub though; they've fancied it up just a bit to pleasure your palate.   Any questions on the menu, the beers, or a pairing can be aptly handled by any of the staff. The service is usually top notch. Sit back, order, enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have no idea how I heard about this place since I never go to Surprise, but decided to try it for my birthday dinner with a friend and was definitely not disappointed.   I started with the house Hefeweizen, which was pretty good, and got the Beer Cheese hamburger. It was so good! If I had to be nitpicky, the burger was a little salty and was more well-done than the medium I requested, but the overall taste was too good to let that stand in the way of enjoying my meal. The hand-cut fries were also good.   We ended the meal with the smokin' smores dessert an was not disappointed. A lot of marshmallow to dig through to get to the rest of the meal, but I like marshmallow, so didn't care.   I see a lot of reviews about poor service, but we had an AMAZING server! Her name was Emily and although she didn't necessarily do anything out of the ordinary, she was incredibly attentive and kind, essentially the poster child for what you want a server to be. She definitely made our experience so much better, so if she or management ever see this, thank you!   I live a majority of the year out of state, but when I come back to visit the Phoenix area, I will definitely come back. Highly recommend State 48 Brewery!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. The food is phenomenal and the service is amazing.  I have never had bad service there and have been there more then half a dozen times. The outside area (when it's cool out) is great for kids because the corn hole is entertaining for them."}
{"text":"Good service except the slowest bartender ever. Great food- menu and quality. Great beer selection. My only complaint is that they have tvs everywhere and a subscription to Sunday ticket but according to the manager on duty they are not permitted to turn the sound up. Its a \"pub\". Monday night football Cardinals home game and they don't \"cater to the football crowd.\" He also said that this was the first time anyone has asked to hear the game. Don't come if you want to watch the game.   At the end of the day it was very obvious that most of the people in the place or watching the game. They cheered every big play!   Disappointed in the \"policy\"."}
{"text":"I was so excited when a good brewery finally came to the Surprise area, and State 48 doesn't disappoint! My boyfriend and I have tried a lot of their beers, and so far we have liked them all! It's nice that their menu isn't taken over by IPAs too, they have a really good variety.   The food here is great as well, I've tried their spring salad, turkey reuben, and wings, and loved them all. My boyfriend got the totchos today, they were a little soggy but still pretty good! The only thing I really haven't liked are the fish and chips, they're always really salty.   The staff is always very friendly, and it's a fun atmosphere so I definitely recommend coming here if you're in the west valley :) if the parking lot seems full, it's still worth going inside because there's never too long of a wait. Most of the cars are often for other places in the area!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Awesome food and all sorts of good beer. I don't even like beer, but they have some sweet and delicious ones that any beer hater would fall in love with."}
{"text":"Let me start by mentioning that this is NOT my first visit to this restaurant. I was incredibly disappointed by my visit today. In the past my good was sub standard but the drinks were good... which is what drew is in so I didn't complain.  Today however I went in with my family and let's just say there was little to be desired. I ordered the fish and chips which were soggy. They were seasoned well but as a whole I just couldn't truly enjoy my meal.  The fries that came with my dish were cold and stale. More was left on the plate than was eaten.  One person in our party had ordered a Royals burger. This burger came with a \"happy sauce\", he happy sauce is no more than tartar sauce! I know this because it was the same tartar sauce that came with my fish. Needless to say this is not something a normal person would expect to receive on a burger.  Another red flag to me was hat our waiter did not write down any of our order. We ordered an appetizer, 4 meals, and a bar drink all at once. I had a feeling our waiter must miss something because a lot was ordered at once. Needless to say the margarita I ordered never showed up. Thankfully he never put it in so I wasn't charged but I was looking forward to the prickly pear Margarita as I have had it before and no one makes it better.  Overall the atmosphere and beer are nice. The food is lacking and most of the staff seems to be okay with making a minimum tip..."}
{"text":"What can I say? Solid brewer. Solid beer. Can't speak for the food, but the IPA game here is on par with local heavy weights, Four Peaks and Scottsdale Beer Company. Service is good and the place is clean. Laughlin lost a solid brewer to this place. Parking is sketch with Spring Training in full swing, but overall, it's worth the 37 mile drive for me. The Wheat Beer is spot on style wise. Nothing adventurous, nothing bad."}
{"text":"Disappointing first experience. Service was slow on a Sunday morning at 11:00 when it was not even busy. Finally a server arrived to take our order. 10-15 minutes later they come back and say they are out of the meatloaf my husband ordered. We had ordered a couple of beer flights that never even showed up. Since he had his heart set on the meatloaf, my husband was not finding anything else that sounded good, so rather than trying to figure out something else to settle for, we decided to leave. They really need to get their act together. The other menu items seemed intriguing, but if the service is lacking, they will not survive."}
{"text":"First time here.  My new favorite.  Beers awesome food fantastic. If you don't like this place it's you."}
{"text":"Nice alternative in Surprise . Cauliflower bites are my favorite. I like the open space and indoor / outdoor bar . Not a beer drinker but I would definitely go back just for the atmosphere. Nothing else really like it in Surprise."}
{"text":"I absolutely love everything about this place. The only thing I hate is that I didn't find it sooner! Excellent food and menu, fantastic beer, friendly servers and great decor and seating options.  There's a large comfy outdoor patio, huge bar, and plenty of indoor seating where you can watch cooks tossing the pizza dough.    Food....the peanut butter burger (hey, don't knock it til you try it, bro) made me cry tears of happiness. Okay maybe not, but it made my mouth very happy. The meatloaf is KILLER! It ain't yo mama's meatloaf with the nasty coagulated ketchup on top. For beer, try the watermelon wheat. It smells like gum and tastes like rainbows.  But seriously, it's damn good. I love you, State 48. I can't quit you."}
{"text":"Beer was so, so. Food was cold and the staff was slow. I went into this place with hopes of being great because its close to my house....left down. I won't go back."}
{"text":"We went there with our friends.  It was pretty noisy, and holding a conversation is not easy.  One entree ordered was a salad.  It was average. Fish and chips, pretty good.  Turkey Ruben, not bad.  Fried chicken was terrible.  It was served within 10 minutes of ordering, so it was already prepared and then reheated.  It was overlooked and dry.   More breaking  than chicken.  The corn bread was pretty good, but the chicken was almost inedible!  Don't order the fried chicken!"}
{"text":"We have come here several times and have been very happy with the food and the service. So we were very happy and excited to bring our friends on Saturday night. It was very crowded when we arrived at 6:30 pm and we were told there was a 60-minute wait time. We went to the outside bar and there were empty tables, but we were told we couldn't sit at any of them as the only place we could sit was at the bar, which, of course, was full. We never could figure out why those empty tables were never used with that huge crowd waiting to be seated. We finally found a couple of bar stools by the wall and waited for our name to be called. Our friends finally found seats at the inside bar so we were separated while waiting for a table. We checked with the desk a few times and each time we were told we were still not up yet. Remember we checked in at 6:30?  Well, at 8:21 pm, we again checked with the desk. By that time, the crowd had thinned out. The desk girl told us that she was so sorry--that she had, in error, skipped over our name. She sat us immediately but we were seated back in what I would call more or less the kitchen area. There were several empty booths and tables in what I considered more prime seating so why we weren't seated there is unknown.  No apology was offered by the server or the management for our unnecessary 2-hour wait.  I would expect at least an apology if not a discount for the mistake by State 48, and will definitely hesitate to come again and will definitely not recommend it to our friends."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of state 48.. I started going there 3 times a month. The beer is amazing . The food has always come out wrong and a complete miss. . Soggy pizza, no sauce on my pizza hamburger, cold soup soggy frys .Today was my final straw after giving it 10 chances. Great beer today.. cold soup, no sauce on pizza hamburger again and 1 hour 34 minutes for crappy food while all five tables who came after us got their food. They comped us one meal.  I'm over horrible food and service it's not worth the good beer experience."}
{"text":"Mario (owner/operator) is a great person and always willing to go above and beyond. I have been to several of his restaurants and always get the best service and food."}
{"text":"I had the chicken strips and fries.  Very hot and fresh. The homemade ketchup/mustard are awesome! Wanted to try the bread pudding, but this was on an older menu I saw on yelp, so I got the smores dessert as recommended by the waitress and was not disappointed. Great selection of drinks!! Now I just need to come back at happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably our go to spot when all the other restaurants have a 90 min wait. That may sound bad but it isnt. The longest ive had to wait here was 20 minutes. The food is always good, especially with the picky eaters in my family. The pizza is phenomenal but i cant stop eating the pbj burger. Their seating is huge and the beer is good. I seem to come here once a month which is saying a lot."}
{"text":"To be fair we went in Saint Patrick's day but we went for lunch and music was so loud we couldn't hear person next to us.  We were near the only patrons in restaurant if it could be turned down slightly and after agreeing, nothing happened.  He could have said it wasn't possible.  Beer selection was out of this world but food was mediocre.  My fried fish was soggy and greasy.  Just an overall disappointing lunch."}
{"text":"Had one of the best burger's I have had in some time. I do not remember the name but it ad some bacon on that guy. It was extremely flavorful and the chef cooked it perfectly to meet my request!"}
{"text":"So living in surprise got excited for this place.   Pros- beer cheese beer cheese and beer cheese. It was freaking amazing.  We order the pretzels with the cheese was good. One think was my kids chicken strips. Came out with 3 big chicken breast probably could feed 4 kids. They don't take reservations but allow you to call ahead 15 minutes prior.   Cons- we got drinks fast but the follow up to order food took a little while.  One big thing I didn't like was my pizza I ordered was brought out 10 minutes before the rest of my families food. My wife had the burger not a fan, also you have to pay separate for fries.   The ok's I had the boss pizza it was good I would get it again.  I would come again give it a couple more tries."}
{"text":"Great beers particularly In Tent City and Sound of Freedom, good salads and pizzas.  Fast service and friendly wait staff.  Generous happy hour prices."}
{"text":"WARNING++++NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME at the time of this review 6-26-16 and the home brews won't be ready for a month.  Short Story- Menu reads like a Fantasy Novel. Sounds GREAT but is not what is served and whoever seemed like the manager didn't act like they listened to my criticism and didn't even say I'm sorry.  Long Story-  We got seated at an uncomfortable booth by the bar. I was going to start with a house crafted beer but found out the house brewed beer won't be ready for about a month. However they are selling other local beers so I went with something else.  We decided to share the Ahi Tuna Tostadas.   They come out from the food jockey WITHOUT sharing plates.  They were described on the menu as Ahi Tuna Tartare over a corn tostada with roasted corn and jicama slaw, pickled red onions and cilantro lime aioli.   I received one solid French Fry shaped piece of not the cleanest tasting tuna covered with cabbage cole slaw with maybe one corn kernel and some sort of loose white liquid. I brought this to the attention of the server and the server said that he would inform the kitchen. This was not served as described. This was hard to eat without sharing plates and hard to eat because log of tuna and also this wasn't delicious. This Cole Slaw sort of clashes with Ahi Tuna. Maybe fresh bright cilantro would have saved it if they had some on it?  I had the Falafel Burger. The Falafel was ok and didn't seem like it was made with fresh herbs but was made with the correct flavors so that was ok to me. The green curry coconut yogurt lacked the green curry taste and the coconut taste and seemed the same as the loose white liquid from the Ahi Tuna Tostadas. I wasn't able to eat it with the bread as a sandwich. I can't imagine anyone would be able to eat this as a sandwich because nobody on earth has a mouth that big. I think one burger size patty would have worked out better than two small thick patties.  I do note they do offer a bun-less option I should have went with.   As my side I had the Roasted Corn and Jicama Slaw THAT DIDN'T CONTAIN ANY CORN OR JICAMA and was just cabbage slaw. I wasn't able to eat the cole slaw because it was unappetizing It had something with a orange tint added that didn't taste right to me.  Even though this is a newly opened restaurant there is still no excuse to serve food like that.  Someone checked on us that might have been a manager.  I showed her the slaw. The woman said at first that you know jicama looks like cabbage and then my blood started to boil. NOW THAT MADE ME ANGRY. To me she insinuated that I don't know the difference between cabbage and jicama. I Shoved my fork in it and it was green shredded cabbage. Then she said something like they were busier than they expected to be and she guessed they ran out of stuff. She said that she would tell the kitchen.  I told her the correct thing to do is to be honest with the customer. I told her that it wouldn't be an issue if my server was honest with me and me that they ran out out of roasted corn and jicama slaw. I wouldn't be mad at all because then that is what I would expect or I'd have the option to order something different.  TO ANY RESTAURANT- If you run out of stuff you have two choices. 1- Take it off the menu. They call that 86 it in restaurant language 2- Be honest with your guest (if you want them to return) and tell them you are out of X and are substituting with Z  My husband had the Beer Cheese Steak with Fries. The steak was tender and the sandwich with fries were OK but it would have been nice if we were offered ketchup for the fries.  As really ok as the steak sandwich was......Between the substitutions, misses, and possibly management attitude.  This is really one star to me. I don't plan to return.  I'll be generous since they are a newly opened restaurant. They have potential to be good someday because of a lovely written menu but need strong leaders for food execution and they need someone with front of house skills.  Good Luck!  As a slight update 6-30-16 received a not warm or fuzzy response from S48B. Telling me Not to visit their restaurants. I posted S48B correspondence with the photos I uploaded."}
{"text":"Not impressed...had fried chicken and most of it was batter we were disappointed.  Everything had an odd taste to it..even the tea tasted weird."}
{"text":"My boyfriend just moved to the area and we were so happy to find this place! Their service was a little slow that night but that didn't take away from their amazing beer, I had the mango wheat and my boyfriend had the \"something\" Bitch... it was amazing! We both ordered a burger, he did the state 48 burger with the sweet potato fries- OMMMG AMAZING! I did the chefs burger which had this amazing sauce and cheese curds on it. Regular fries would be good but mine were kind of cold and stall, I could tell when fresh they would be delightful! And definitely get a side of their ranch. Amazing!!!! Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. This is your typical \"Foody\" \"hip\" \"pub\".. So if this describes you, you will love it. Definitely not a \"family\" restaurant & over priced for me."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place again. This time we had a better experience. I had the grilled romaine salad with basil vinaigrette. It was a delicious salad! My husband had a brisket sandwich and chips. He really liked it. The flavors were good and the food was fresh.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now. Both visits have been decent. First time I was there, I had the hot Italian,  This sandwich was fantastic, loved the combination of flavors, the pizza dough as the bread was a great idea. Sandwich is hearty and filling. Second visit I had the schnitzel sandwich, it was good, I was expecting better, but it was good enough to eat the whole sandwich. Kids love their cheese pizza, and chicken fingers. Not a fan of their mac and cheese. It's nice to have a non franchise restaurant in the area. Place is owned by the same owners of  Angela's in Sun City Grand, another great place to eat."}
{"text":"Very good food. We had the chicken Cesar salad, and a pb and j burger. It was a decent price, so no complaints about that. My only complaint is that it was so loud. The sound just bounces off everything. I couldn't head my husband to have a conversation. So I wouldn't call this a very good date night restaurant. They have a rug by the front door that an elderly gentleman tripped on and got hurt. So watch out for that on your way out."}
{"text":"Really good beer with a great selection.  Flights are a good price.  Food is ok.  Staff isn't that great.  Tough to see tv from patio so going to sit outside and watch sports is tough.  But they have good beer and bags outside so I'd go again"}
{"text":"We have gone to State 48 several times and it was good, but something always seemed to be missing. We stopped by tonight, and it was REALLY good. We got 2 drinks,2 burgers and our 4 and 10 month old split the kid's pizza.  My husband had the poutine burger which looked lovely and he said tasted SO good( I'm weird and not like poutine, so I'm not a good judge here ) and i had the beer cheese burger which was very tasty! I poured some of the beer cheese on my burger and used the rest for my fries. I had the bluebeery cocktail and my husband had a few of their beer; both good. We are so very happy that State 48 has chosen Surprise as their home and hope they stay on for a good long time. We need it !"}
{"text":"I give you 5 stars for Jerry, the bartender. He made me feel welcome and didn't mind my indecision on beer or food. I was a little disappointed that he couldn't give opinions about the food because he hadn't tried much, but such is life. I tried the roasted corn risotto that was pretty good. I tasted the polenta after that which wasn't quite as tasty. I ordered the funghi pizza to go, which was, again, tasty, but didn't withstand my 5 minute drive home. I didn't so much care for the other bartender, John, who seemed a little taxed by being there, commenting loudly about tables ordering shots, and also forgot to put in my to go order. However, like I said above, Jerry is your bread and butter. He's a great talker and worth double what you're paying him. Good luck to you guys."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends as I'm from out of town.   Overall this place was great! It's your typical gastro-pub where they have good craft beers on tap and nice gourmet food.   I ordered a burger, I can't remember which one now. But I remember it being really good and cooked properly. Fries were good as well.   I had a couple of their IPA's on tap. One I wasn't a huge fan of, it was a little to sweet for my personal tastes. The other was great though.   Like I said, overall it's a great place! If I ever find myself in the area again I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Their sangria is the bomb!!!! The wife's words... lol their white pizza is amazing.. Plenty of seating. Really good beer!!!!! And I'm not a beer drinker."}
{"text":"Beers are great. Today the service was crappy. We sat at the table 15mins then went to hostess and manger. A table next to us for seated and a server right away. A different manager was telling us about all her problem.....don't care, just care about m\"  service. Pizza, pasta good. Beef sandwich chewy."}
{"text":"Not a long wait for a new and very busy place. Really great, helpful, and friendly waitress. It was very loud but, that was expected because the place is new and very full.  The beer selection is full of local choices, very tasty choices. I recommend the FreakN raspberry wheat! It is excellent!  I love that things are locally sourced. I support locally sourced foods.  The cheese, meat, and dried fruit plate was a less than wonderful appetizer for us. This was maybe the least tasty plate of its kind that I have encountered. I was pretty disappointed in it. I hope that in the future it will include choices so that it can be tailored to individual tastes and be more enjoyable.  The ceviche avocado was also pretty plain. The avocado was top notch quality but, the filling was lack luster.   The ahi tuna salad had amazing tuna! Really amazing! But the salad was more a Cole slaw. This should be more apparent on the menu and would be more palatable to more types of people if it was offered on a lettuce type salad as an alternative. Many people do not like Cole slaw.   I have high hopes for this place but, I think if it is going to succeed in a place like Surprise, it will need to offer some less eclectic options too.  And a big one, the in house sauces are great but, kids need plain ketchup, and plain ranch. If you want to draw in families, make it kid friendly."}
{"text":"i love when new restaurants open up in Surprise, but they are not always a hit.  STATE 48 IS AWESOME!!  the food is excellent!  all fresh and unique.  the beers on tap are all local and they are even going to add their own beers.  my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"excellent food and amazing array of beer options. Love the fun atmosphere. Even some of the odd combos worked!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch,the state 48 burger was pretty good.I wasn't a huge fan of the fries though,had a biltmore  blonde phx ale pretty good beer.service was overall pretty good.I'd go again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, although they discontinued my favorite beer, big blue van. The chefs are great, they have come to my table 4 times since I started going there and they ask me how I like my food or have suggestions or just come out to make sure it met my expectations. I highly recommend to go here with friends and family"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended from a co-worker. My experience started out rocky and finally crashed and burned.   When arriving the lobby was pretty empty and we were excited that we got there ahead of the crowd.  Unfortunately as the crowd started to filter in we were still last to be seated.  The guys we're planning to get a few beers in before happy hour ended at 5.  After waiting ten minutes we went to the server stand to ask who was our server.  That person said she would check on that for us.   Another ten minutes later still no server.   Finally the server next to us was kind enough to apologize and ask for our drink orders.  We asked if we could place our entire order because we had been there quite a while and was pretty hungry at this point.    The food came out fine with one exception.  My salad was smothered in a not so tasty salad dressing so I asked to trade it out with another salad.  Needless to say it never came.    The GM finally came over for introductions and apologies.  He sincerely discounted our bill by 1/2 asking for us to give it another try.  And we agreed.   We received the bill and they not only charged me 1/2 of the first salad I sent back but they also charged 1/2 of the replacement salad I never even saw.    To top it off the final bill was $17.53 and we gave a $12.47 tip.  However $40 was charged to our card.    I grabbed a taco for my dinner on the way home.  Very very very disappointed."}
{"text":"The food that was ordered was good. The beer ketchup was terrible, therfore got ranch for the fries. However, they didn't tell us they change for each ranch. Which unfortunately it's disappointing when paying $50 for a meal, they feel like they have to nickle and dime you. Because of the condiments that come with the food are bad or charged for, we probably won't be back.  Management responded to a comment I made on Facebook and rather than apologizing and fixing the situation, they made rude comments and made the situation 10x's worse!! See the attached pictures."}
{"text":"Food seemed to be ok, only had the chefs board. Was going to eat dinner but a server spilled ranch dressing all over my wife as he was walking by and dropped the container. The waiter apologized 5 minutes later and left it at that. Having worked in the service industry I would have expected a little better response. I went to the hostess after 15 minutes to ask for a manager and then waited another 15 minutes for the manager to show up only after asking again for the manager. The manager was understanding but the response was not expected."}
{"text":"One of my favorite happy hour hangouts. Food is always great. My personal favorites are the chefs board, the grilled steak and romaine wedge, the pbj burger and the beer cheese burger. Ask for the Buffalo chips poutine style. Don't get me started on their wood fired pizzas- must try them all! Chuck does an awesome job brewing great beers with a rotating menu. Love love love State 48!"}
{"text":"Finally a cool place to hang out, grab a drink and just have fun in Surprise. The food is amazing!!!! Pizza is my favorite!!! Employees are so nice and interactive with you. Just an all around great place. Didn't take kiddos (3&1) this time but now that I've checked it out, I know kids will love it next time! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!"}
{"text":"We LOVED this place. We sat outside and the kids played cornhole while we waited for our food. The food was excellent!! We had a Caesar salad, Margherita pizza, and beer cheese burgers. The wheat state 48 was a delicious brew as well. Everything was so good we wanted to go back for more!! Only downer was they were out of Tito's and Dr. Pepper but everything else was so good it made up for it."}
{"text":"Very, very good.  The waitstaff, the food and last but not least, the beer selection are all first rate.  If you are a fan of IPA's, this is the place to be.  They usually have 3 or 4 great IPA's on tap.  Get there early.  They are super popular and they do get busy.   Busy is the sign of a successful combination.   It is a bit noisy, but, don't let that stop you.   The only reason for 4 stars not 5, is the wait and the noise.  It is comfortable and very friendly once you get in and seated.  You can dine in or out and that is very cool. The menu has a great variety of excellent choices.  We have had burgers, salads, fish n chips, and pizza all top quality.   Give it a try.  You will not be sorry.  I suggest you plan ahead as the wait can get long, like I said before, they have a very successful business model, so of course they get busy."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Grateful to have a new option in Surprise but we feel they are struggling. Their own brew is not yet ready so we ordered off a menu of other brews. The food was 'ok' nothing fabulous. Shared portion of Craft mac n cheese was a child's portion...definitely not to be shared. We got seated in an area next to the former sushi cook area..thry now prepare salads and pizza. All we heard our entire stay was a loud yell 'runner! I need a runner'' =cooks shouting out for available servers. The seating was slouchy....melted into the seat and could not reach the table. I'm guessing they are used. I gave it a 2 only because I know they ae pretty new and there is room to grow and improve. I would return only to try their home brews."}
{"text":"Cheyenne was our server and she was awesome! If you go ask for her, the other staff was also really friendly. The pretzels are awesome, soft like they should be. The beer cheese burger was perfect and a good amount of food to split with my fiance. Beer was good, wanted to try the churro bread pudding but they had just ran out. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Where to start, waited 45 minutes to be seated, although there were plenty of empty tables, five in our group, one ordered chicken sandwich, 3 ordered hamb, I ordered pizza after another hour cold food was delivered, but was informed they couldn't make the pizza due to bad dough, did I want to order something else? Might have 45 minutes ago, but at this point just wanted to go home, were entertained by a group of rowdy ten year olds playing corn ball, not a great Sunday night, and no manager ever appeared to apologize, they did comp my tea"}
{"text":"I have waited to try State 48, and decided to go in for lunch since there is always a wait.  I love their eclectic decor.  We had the soft pretzels which were great! The cheese was awesome and I saved the extra for my fries.  I had the caprese chicken sandwich.  It had all the potential of great in the world but the bun was dry and ruined it.        My husband had a burger, not sure which one, but all I know is that he left 1/2 of it on the plate and it was not because of having a small appetite.  The white tank beer was really good.  The food all came fairly quickly.  I think our waitress was new or just didn't know the menu, but tried to hide it rather than just being honest.  She didn't know the beer was one of state 48's brewed beer, not totally sure about the fried pickles, and kinda disappeared.  I'll give it another try and go back and try something different."}
{"text":"Actual went there last night.  Food is very good.  The waitress we had last night Nikki very friendly made our experience a pleasant one.   They do have a turn over with help.  Our waitress has been there since September very knowledgeable.  We have probably eat here 10 to 15 times.  Only once the order was wrong and since we eat out at other places this is great. Hope people will give State 48 another try.  They are also opening another location downtown Phoenix,"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night. The place is very busy so that's always a good sign. Put our name on the waiting list for what was about a 20 Min wait. We waited on the patio with others but when they called our name inside someone else jumped up and took our spot, otherwise the hostess would venture out to the patio and call names. We noted a couple that had arrived after us had been seated so we went in and checked. The hostess told us what happened but wouldn't show us who the people were that took our spot. Nevertheless we were seated. After a fair amount of time we still had not been acknowledge by any Server. We stopped a Waitress and asked if she knew who our Waitress might be. It was she. We had plenty of time to look over the menu so she took our order right then. We ordered 2 Scottsdale Big Mouth Blonde's but they had none. Instead took the only other blonde beer Van Buren Blonde. It was very skunky, we couldn't finish it. I ordered the Chicken Alfredo and it was unbelievable, seriously I held no hope of getting nothing more than average food here but what a surprise. We ordered the Totchos appetizer with jalapenos and it was very delicious, I recommend.  My Wife had the Chicken Lettuce Wrap appetizer and it too was outstanding. My Son had the 48 Burger and Kettle chips. He had no complaints and I had some of his chips which were delicious. Really very good food here, well above average. Our Totchos appetizer arrived with our meal but management quickly comped them, so very decent experience here less my beer choices. I probably should have had a taster before ordering."}
{"text":"Out for the weekend a lil mini vacation with Mr.GC to see the LA Dodgers during spring training. Out and about heading to get MR.GC a haircut and shave and head to target to get some supplies for the campsite. I spotted a brewery. I said, \"Babe look a brewery.\", he said, \"where?\" and before we knew it we were parked and walking in. We had not planned to go to one, but we were really in no hurry: we were on our time. it was around lunch time so we decided just one beer or two and a meal to share. It was nice that it provided food we like brewery's like that.  Walked in and it was really nice indoor outdoor seating which the bar divided. A enclosed separate brick stove seating area for fresh prepared pizza station next to the 10 gal brew station. we did a couple of there samples, but absolutely fell in love with the Blueberry, so in love we ended up buying a growler which for us we have never done. So in other words we were impressed. Our meal was just as fabulous. High end gourmet plates. We shared the turkey sandwich with a side chicken salad and shoe strings fries light and crispy nicely season. The atmosphere was very Arizona friendly. We sat at the bar outside, the weather was just fantastic so we were not going to waist it considering it was gloomy and rainy back at home. We left as happy campers ready to head back to campsite and get ready for the game."}
{"text":"Great beer variety . Food is delicious. Convenient location . Nice decor. I would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Busy night. Ate a the bar where 1 bartender was trying to serve and wait on customers. Get her some help! Food was average.  Beer was ok.  We will try it again before making a long term recommendation."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars.  We have been twice.  The first visit was a little bumpy; however they had just opened a few days before so it was expected to have some rough spots. The food was on pointe and their craft  beer game was solid during the first visit, so we decided to give them another go round.  Service was way better (since it was a Tuesday and kind of slow, our waiter was very attentive).  Again, the food (for the most part) was ah-mazing.  Beer selection has a good rotation.  I was sad they didn't have the witbier from last week, however the PB Porter from Peoria Artisan was a welcome addition.    Pros: -PB&J Burger (I swear, try it ala mode - it's soooo good! They must think I'm a weirdo though.  Our waitress said the kitchen staff was confused by my request ) -The fried chicken - enough to feed 2 people and the best we've had! -The sloppy corn bread- divine - The Divolono (sp?) Pizza - spicy with a hint of honey sweetness -CRAFT BEER!!!!  Cons: -The pretzels - 3 small pretzel \"sticks\" - maybe 4 would be a better number and they just seemed very small.  Both of our orders also were cold.  -Our side of fries came in a large dish, but there were so few that it looked like we got someone's leftovers.  They were hot though, and my 6 year old seemed to like them    All in all, we will definitely be back.  Maybe not with our littles (they get bored easily).  A wonderful start and I can't wait to see State 48 become a solid 5 star rating! (We also can't wait to try their beers in a few weeks!)"}
{"text":"So I had the pleasure of visiting this place two days in a row- that's how good it was & how much I Loved it! The first night my waitress was amazing and recommended the Fish Tacos, by far the best I ever had! Made me want to go again, so of course I did the next day... lol- that night I sat at bar, since there' was room, had a pizza with fig reduction, mozzarella, arugula & balsamic reduction sauce!  it was good. Paired with a Blueberry Ale- service is great, atmosphere is on point and the menu can keep you intrigued for many visits, but don't believe me, just go order the Fish Tacos!"}
{"text":"Only been here once. Had beer flights and tasted several delicious brews. Love the microbrewery atmosphere and food offerings. Shared some appetizers with my wife. I ordered a burger and my wife ordered a pizza, all of which was very tasty. A bit pricey, but well worth it as an occasional splurge over the boring, chain restaurants. Will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"The rating would be higher but today is my second time of dealing with apologies and blank looks. I'm allergic to cows milk and instead of putting truffle mayo on my sandwich as the menu stated they substituted it for an avocado cream sauce without telling me. I guess I wasn't supposed to notice? After a couple of bites and tasting the obvious change, I brought it to the waitress' attention.  She then went and checked with the kitchen and came back to tell me they didn't have any. The waitress then proceeds to tell me if she had known about my allergy she could've done something about it. Quite frankly if they had put the ingredients on the food as the menu states there wouldn't have been any issue. I'm competent to know what I can and can't eat. But I guess it was somehow my fault. By the way there was no offer of compensation at all. This was the first instance.   We stayed away for quite sometime in hopes that they would've worked out such kinks in their service. We've gone back since then without any problems and the food and beer was fine. Today however, I ordered dessert to go. My dessert was supposed to have caramel on it.  I opened my dessert and didn't see any caramel so I asked for some extra only to be told they didn't have ANY ( this was after checking with the kitchen) I guess I wasn't supposed to find out? Yet again?! The waitress politely said I apologize without any offer of compensation ( by the way I'm pretty positive it was the same one as last time). It's hard to keep having this happen to me. But at least I've been catching it. How many people don't? State 48, get your crap together and train your staff to inform customers when you are out of ingredients and learn good public relations so people will want to return. \"I'm sorry\"... \"My apologies\" does not cut it!"}
{"text":"Good fire grilled Pizza, and good service. Bloody Mary was decent. This place is always busy, has a great atmosphere. We will return, I would say it's one of Surprise Az's best restaurants."}
{"text":"During the spring training baseball game in Surprise, AZ they announced this brewery as a place to go after the game. We decided to give it a try.  The mosaic IPA was tasty and the bar tender was trying his hardest to tend to the customers. However, there was a long wait to be seated for a table even though 1/2 of the tables were open. It seemed the hostesses were not prepared or the restaurant was not staffed adequately.  Very disappointed indeed. In addition, the customers were not properly informed on whether or not the patio was for open seating. The sign said yes, but the hostesses said NO. No one was being seated in the patio. Please, fix this problem. Easy to do!"}
{"text":"Have been back a couple of times and now the patio is open its a pretty cool place, the pizza has always been good."}
{"text":"Not one of my favorites. It was a Tuesday night, slow service. The ceviche stuffed avacado was my favorite. Blueberry Ale was good as well. Por brothers sandwich was way greasy and over fried, carnitas were dry. Fries were way greasy. Bummer, I was looking forward to a great meal."}
{"text":"Giving 3 stars instead of 4 only because the beers weren't as good as my favorite local brewery. Maybe I just didn't try the right one. I tasted 6, but there were still many more to choose from. The food was pretty good though, especially the Brussels sprouts appetizer. Yum! I will eat here again, and hopefully find the right beer for me next time."}
{"text":"The food and beer are amazing but the service was not as it took entirely too long and it wasn't very packed.  I would also say that the cleanliness of the restrooms was not up to par and need some serious attention. One urinal in a pub, really! Not to mention toilet paper hanging off the ceiling, huge wads.   Don't get me wrong the beer was great and food i had was good. Just expected more from this place especially after going to other locations."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, food was \"meh\", definitely not terrible, definitely not great, especially for the prices.  Service is not \"hit or miss\", its more like, \"miss or almost hit\".  I would love this place to be better as I'm close and could be enjoying their brews on the regular, but the food and service really prevent me from getting too excited about the place."}
{"text":"The service was super slow and the food wasn't that great the only thing we really enjoyed was the beer selection"}
{"text":"We are here for opening night.  As with any first night they are busy with a few glitches but nothing out of the ordinary.  We started with the pretzels and beer cheese fondue.  The pretzels are thick but not dense.  I guess we are used to thinner pretzels.  The amount of coarse salt on top was overwhelming.  We found ourselves brushing a lot of it off. The beer cheese fondue holds up well but tastes more like queso than beer cheese.  The whole grain mustard is the star!  We ordered the beer cheese steak sandwich with fries, the half rotisserie chicken with corn risotto and green beans, and a kids cheeseburger and fries.      The beer cheese steak was described to us as being prime rib dipped in au jus then topped with the beer cheese that's also used in the appetizer.   What came out appeared more like it had all been dipped in the beer cheese fondue.  It was very heavy on the cheese sauce.   The fries seemed hit and miss.  Some were soft and some were overly crispy (through and through).  The half rotisserie chicken entree was very good.  The corn risotto is so good I'd eat it as the side for any of the entries.  The chicken was moist and the demi glace as excellent.    The kids menu cheeseburger was lacking.  The challah bread bun was toasted and the edge all the way around was very crispy.  The burger came out without any condiments.   Beware that they don't have any regular ketchup.  They have a homemade beer ketchup that is a very thin consistency and hard to even put a finger on what it tastes like.   We got mayo for the burger but my 8 year old granddaughter ended up not eating it.  She munched on fries and sat at the corner of the pizza area watching them flip pies.  By the way, the ranch is very very good.  It's got a dilly taste to it that we really liked.  We ordered two pizzas (a pepperoni and a 4 cheese) to take home for those that didn't come with.  The crust is on the thinner side but not cracker thin.   Although the pepperoni pizza could stand to have more sauce, it was very good.   If you don't like basil, make sure to let them know when ordering.  They put a basil chiffonade on both pizzas.     Some takeaways from night one (and some of these things may already be in the works): 1. Need something for the kids to do.  The kids menu is on the regular menu.  Perhaps some crayons and place mats to color on or a blop of pizza dough to play with.  My grand daughter kept asking if they had the table top game consoles like at some other restaurants. 2. Offer some regular condiments especially for the kids.  The beer ketchup on a kids burger may not fly with most kids.   Would have loved to see some dill pickle slices etc as well. 3.  Perhaps offer a regular burger bun along with the challah bun and whole wheat bun.  I believe I read a veggie patty offering is in the works, but it wasn't mentioned on the menu. 4.  Management please go around and check the stability of the tables.  Our table was extremely wobbly and easily moved.  Drinks were sloshed around several times because of it. 5. State 48's menu seems very eclectic.  I'd like to see some 'dumbed down' offerings like a standard burger or a build your own burger.    Instead of two different entries using half chicken, perhaps one of them be a boneless chicken breast.  I am sure we will be back.  The first few weeks are trial and error for many things.  I expect this rating will rise as time goes on.   The west west valley is definitely in need of a place like State 48 Brewery."}
{"text":"The boss Pizza was delicious.  The kids Pizza was pretty big. Overall great service.  Brian the waiter was very attentive and polite.  The beer selection was amazing. Great spot for family and friends."}
{"text":"Melanie at the bar is so \"freak N Sweet\"  the food and the home and brews are amazing.   Try there custom blend of their light blonde with their blood orange brew for the perfect blend.  The food is amazing.  SURPRISE IS Blessed to have a high end brewery like this.  Nothing like it. Period"}
{"text":"Solid 5 stars for food, ambiance, service and beer.  We sat at the bar, and we were immediately offered a beer menu and food menu.  The bartender was prompt and friendly.  They have about 20 beers on tap, so husband and I each ordered a flight.  He likes the more bitter beers; I like the lighter beers.  The food menu offered pizzas, burgers, salads, soups, sandwiches and shared plates such as chicken wings, cauliflower wings, tacos, and more. I was really intrigued by the P.B.&J burger.  We ordered one to split.  My beer fight was great.  Very rarely do I order a flight and like every one of the beers, but this was the exception.  The beers I selected were the Blood Orange Belgian Blonde, Blueberry Ale, Dust Devil (British brown ale), Mango Wheat, and one of the guest beers, Freak'N Raspberry Wheat.  The P.B.&J. burger was unbelievingly good.  Peach-jalapeño jelly, peanut butter and applewood smoked bacon on a brioche bun.  $13.00 and worth every penny.  I was still thinking about that burger an hour later; that's how good it was.  Who would have thought?  To find a brewery that has great beer AND great food is rare.  What a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"Busy night at State 48.  Staff was friendly, and our waitress Crystal P was great!  Drinks were good, although disappointed that the brewery isn't up and running yet. We had the cerviche, beet salad, hamburger, and creme brulee.  All were good and we'll be back.  Keep tweaking it... you'll do great!!"}
{"text":"New restaurant in Surprise in the old Hayashi building that closed down. Started off poorly by being seated in the back of the restaurant in a secondary dining room where they stacked the glass trays they put in the dishwasher.   Problem is there was plenty of seating in the main dining room where there was much more light and life.   We requested a seat change and they obliged.   Much better seating in the main dining room.  Good atmosphere.   Still some old Hayashi decorations hanging around so some more work to be done.  The food was very good.  Had the best salad and the grass fed burger.   Both were excellent. I would not recommend the homemade ketchup or the \"fancy sauce\".   My son had the fish and chips which were really good but they had no malt vinegar.    They just opened 3 days ago so still trying to work out the kinks.  Wait staff was very nice and punctual.  All in all I would recommend State 48 Brewery and will definitely give it a second try.  Well I've been waiting for 15 minutes after giving the server my credit card.    Also forgot to mention how random the decor is.  They are rocking about 4 different styles in here."}
{"text":"Tried this place again hoping for the best but was once again left with some disappointment.  Waitress was nice but struggling being new to the establishment.  Dinner came out prior to appetizers because the pizza comes from a different area. ??? Beer Cheese burger was good except for the layer of skin on the cheese dip which indicated it sat for a while. Kids portipn of pizza is great.  Beer is alright, but nothing \"wow\" that would bring me back. As much as I want it to be better its mediocre at best."}
{"text":"First visit to State 48 and it will not be the last. The atmosphere was comfortable but lively. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. For lunch, my father and I had their brisket sandwich and meatloaf. The brisket was flavorful and enjoyable. The fries that accompanied the dish were awesome. The meatloaf was very good and also accompanied by fries and asparagus. I personally prefer a ketchup/brown sugar sauce but their sauce was pretty good. Overall, we had an enjoyable experience and will come back. I look forward to giving some of their beers a try."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place in surprise! Best salads- everything is delicious.... can't say enough good things. Lots of good gluten friendly options!"}
{"text":"Food took over an hour to be served. They kept apologizing saying it was really busy that night. It was also incredibly LOUD! The server was fun though. Food actually wasn't too bad once we finally received it."}
{"text":"We waited 25 minutes to be seated and the table was in the middle of the waiters walk way. The food took over another 30 minutes to get for a grilled chicken salad and chicken caprese sandwich. It's the second week of spring training and they are not prepared to be this busy according to our server."}
{"text":"Best burger I have had in a long time ! The quality of the food was wonderful, I had the state 48 burger with sweet potato fries. They may be my favorite sweet potato fries ever. Our server was Amy Christina and she was great, we had our baby so it's hard to get through a meal sometimes but she was awesome and so friendly !"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. They can't even give you a full glass of beer. The food and service is okay. Unfortunately, it's the only brewery in the area. Avoid if possible."}
{"text":"Jay and Crystal were our servers for a wedding party and they were PHENOMENAL! They took care of everyone in the wedding party, and all of the guests. They always made sure we had drinks and our plates were always full. Super thankful for them, they made the night 100x better. We will be back again! Thank you State 48 for hosting!! Jeremey is the GM, and checked on us multiple times. Everyone did great, and made sure the wedding went smoothly! Thank you all so much!"}
{"text":"The first time I popped in, I only had beer. The bartenders are great and the selections are FCKING exciting to me. The bartenders are pretty knowledgeable about what they're serving. It's a fun environment. My group and I were somewhat annoyed that we weren't able to mingle outside. (We had to be seated by the host, and there were no open tables. Bar seats were full). We just wanted to play corn hole is all! It's okay, we still had a great time.  The second time I came here was for dinner. All I remember having is a burger. The BEST part about that burger was the BACON JAM. What is that? Delicious. I smeared my fries in the bacon jam and went to heaven."}
{"text":"Nice place. We chose to have a flight and a sausage board. It was all good. We are outside. Very large outdoor area and felt pretty isolated from the parking lots and busy roads surrounding us (which was awesome!) Would definitely return and recommend the place! Thanks!"}
{"text":"We have now been to State 48 Brewery four times and it seems to only get worse! From slow as molasses service to not getting all you ordered and being out of the most popular beers, my family and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I love eating and drinking at State 48. They have great choices for drinks and their food is really good. The best part is that they are very reasonably priced! The outside patio is romantic and pretty even with the road right next to it. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Had one of their beers at the ballpark and it was good. I wanted to try the restaurant. First visit, beer was good, food was good, mostly. She ordered meatloaf. Server said they might be out and asked for an alternate. Server also said that if they were out of the meatloaf, she would let us know. When our plates were brought, no meatloaf, and no heads up that there was a substitution. It would have been nice to know.  Food was acceptable, so came back. Same sort of thing, but with dessert. Waited and waited for dessert, and they brought mine out but were out of hers. Very frustrating.   Doesn't sound all that bad, except that it's now a pattern, every time we come, there's a problem with the food.   5 stars for the beer. All excellent. 2 stars for the food. Average of 3.5 , minus the.5 because we decided not to go back. And that's the bottom line, too many good places to eat in the Phoenix area. No reason to return somewhere that keeps disappointing."}
{"text":"The ceviche stuffed avocado I ordered in the bar as an entree instead of an appetizer was outstanding. Fresh, and just the right amount of zing so as not to overpower the other flavors.  They had dozens and dozens of taps on the bar which all were functional and not decorative. If they are out of one, it probably means it was really, really good. With so many choices, pick another and be grateful you are not in a beer desert. The bar has a garage door theme that opened to the outside patio. Food was delicious, service was adequate and the atmosphere was outstanding. Right on the main drag, parking was a bit tight, but worth it."}
{"text":"We were there last night with 15 people.  Our private room was hot, no air.  The pretzel appetizers were served cold. One guest chicken dinner was cold.  Another guest in our party ordered a well done burger, it arrived medium rare.  One in our party ordered mild chicken wings...they were clearly hot.  When asked about the wings, the supervisor she asked replied \"oh we don't have mild wings, those are all we serve\" (???).   The chips on another order were greasey.  The service was sloooow.  I mean REALLY SLOW that we had to get up from the table to complain.  First drinks literally took FOREVER to arrive. Our Santa Claus decided to go9 find out why our group couldn't get our drink order.  The supervisor he told about the problem replied \"I can't control the bar; you don't understand, we are short handed tonite.\"  HUH??? Do you understand we are paying good money for food AND service and could care less about your problems.  DON'T MAKE YOUR PROBLEMS OUR PROBLEMS!!!  We just wanted to enjoy our evening at a new restaurant.  There wasn't one member of our group that liked the place or ever wanted to come back.  Remember State 48, bad news travels 3 times faster than good news.  Do you realize how many people in Surprise those 15 guests will tell about your store and their experience.  To be fair, the owner came out with desserts.  No one wanted them, they wanted some discount on their check.  He came out and blamed the poor food on bad equipment rather than taking responsibility himself.  He delivered 4 or 5 desserts with 15 spoons.  Tacky.  Our group was a group of veterans.  No discounts.  Will any of us be back?  hahaha.   How long will this place last?   You be the judge."}
{"text":"Finally I got the chance to try State 48 and I was pretty impressed. Now before actually going inside I had the idea of a normal brewery in mind... rustic industrial furniture and bar food... State 48 is a bit different on the inside. It's quite nice and private the way the booths are set up. The food on the menu is a bit more upscale and fancy... aka no mozzarella sticks! My fiancé tried two different beers and was pretty happy. Our food was served hot and pretty good. The mac and cheese and fries are the best part. Our mac and cheese was an app and was about $7 which is a bit much for the cup we got but it was really tasty. Their regular fries and sweet potato fries are really fresh and crispy. The burger was okay and we left happy. Spent about $50 which is okay, wish it was a bit less so we could come back more often. Service was actually pretty good but it was pretty slow when we were there."}
{"text":"Finally a decent place to chill and eat and drink GOOD beer in the far west valley!! Just their soft opening tonight but the food was great- beer choices amazing. Young and old alike- love the decor- state 48 will definitely be THE new Surprise hang out!! Congrats!!"}
{"text":"The first time we visited, there were empty tables, yet we had to wait 20 min to be seated.  We were seated and waited for a long time for our server to take our order.  My dinner arrived 15 minutes before my husband's dinner.  We asked the server and she said the pizza's come out sooner than the regular menu items.  The food was quite good - I think the chef is great, and I love the decor and ambiance!  I really want to love this place, but I think they have sub-par management and need some staff training.  We tried a second time, and only ordered pizza for our table.   Again, the food was great, and our beer experts loved the beer.  But the service was lacking.  Please 48 State - work on the management and training of staff.  We need good (non-chain) restaurants in Surprise."}
{"text":"Weekly specials are always a good option to pick for  food or drinks. Awesome place to hang out!!"}
{"text":"Ya know this place really has potential... but it needs someone to go the extra mile to make it a main stay in Surprise... limited menu.. nice presentation but it's just not there yet... Not someplace I recommend to family coming to AZ for the first time.. I went with coworkers for an event... mmmm yeah not the place I would do that again..."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! The atmosphere is so nice. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the weather today. I ordered the state 48 burger and it was delicious and so juicy. My husband ordered the cheesesteak with beer cheese and it had the thickest slices of steak. The beer cheese was rich and flavorful and tasted great with the homemade fries. You could tell these were authentic fries cut from a potato just like my grandma makes. We splurged on the s'mores dessert and it was crazy good. Rich brownie with sweet crunchy toffee and toasted marshmallow cream, what more could you ask for. My son really enjoyed the kids chicken fingers with housemate dill ranch. All the food came in generous servings. I couldn't have asked for a better local restaurant"}
{"text":"We've been a couple of times now and it doesn't disappoint ! The food is delicious and the kids meals are huge portions  !   Each time we have tried something different and my husband loved the State 48 Burger. We bought my mother there for dinner while she was visiting and she LOVED it ! She really enjoyed the Watermelon Mule and I love to sample the different beers from Arizona !   Definitely will go back ! You must give State 48 a try, you won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"Drinks are pricey - haven't tried food yet but will soon"}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent and I liked the atmosphere.  I'm marking a 3 star rather than 4 based on service.  It was lacking a bit.  I wanted to order the brisket but our waitress told me that they had run out earlier, and that it was done cooking but had to sit for two hours. I was sad and disappointed but I ordered something else and I was OK. About fifteen minutes later she came over  and said, \"Oh guess what? The brisket is ready now. You could've ordered that.\"  I was thinking,\" what the heck!!\"  Why would she come over and say anything?  I would have never known.  Almost like she was taunting me.  Then she let my drink run out and when I finally caught her and asked for more tea , she forgot to get it. About 8 minutes later, my husband had to get her attention to get my drink.  And they weren't even busy!"}
{"text":"Great service, very nice selection of salads and pizza. A welcome addition to the Surprise area."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the first time last night as we met some friends for dinner. I had been wanting to try State 48 for a long time as I had heard nothing but good things about it. All of us liked the vibe of this place. They had a live band playing on the patio which added to the ambiance.  Everyone had drinks but me and they all said the crafted brews were delicious. We ordered appetizers which were the pretzels with cheese sauce and the sausage board. All were extremely delicious and presented on cutting board type platters which only added to the atmosphere. My wife had a salad which looked and she verified was delicious and I had the Royal burger which was actually one of the best burgers I've ever had.  It was cooked to perfection. Everyone was extremely nice and the whole atmosphere was great. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because it was a little slow getting our food however the quality of the food was worth it and won't stop us from going back. I highly recommend State 48 for a great time and delicious food in an extremely laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was great, pizza was great. Beer to expensive, nothing awesome for a brewery. We were rushed out so fast, 35 min for a family of 4 to eat. Appetizer arrived 2 min after we ordered it, meal came 5 min after that. The waiter was not friendly at all. Rude, his name was Vann. I'll give this place one more try. . ."}
{"text":"LOVE coming to State 48. We make it a point to be here once a week. We sit at the bar, with our favorite bartender/server, John, and enjoy yummy beer and great food. We're always sad when we show up and he's not here! Thanks for being awesome, John and State 48!"}
{"text":"You have got to try their PB&J burger!!! Amazing!! They have a ton of beers on tap, and atmosphere feel more big city than suburban!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times. Always good food. Not sure why Friday nights we have to wait for a table and when we're seated there are many tables open. Oh well. Food is worth it. We always try to get Crystal as a waitress but haven't found a bad one yet. Bar staff is friendly too. Prices are reasonable. With a choice of 48 craft beers you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The service is terrible, the food is subpar and you better plan to wait an eternity to be greeted, seated, or served."}
{"text":"Love the Peanut Butter burger & the great selection of draft beers, hands down our families and kids favorite restaurant we come here every chance we get."}
{"text":"the beer is absolutely amazing. huge selection & a good happy hour. however the food is terrible, we ordered bruschetta, expecting your typical bruschetta, it was not even close to it. we ordered a burger & a brisket sandwich. when i first got the burger, i had to pick a piece of black plastic off the the bacon/burger. i ignored that & tried it anyways, it was extremely dry & had no flavor. i asked for some ketchup, thinking that would help, my boyfriend & i both believe that ketchup was bad. it was extremely sour. i told our server/bartender & she said oh well we just filled the ketchups on monday... it was sunday. again, i looked past it & asked for a side of bbq sauce, thinking that can't be bad & that would help the dryness... i was wrong not your typical bbq sauce which i wasn't expecting, again very sour/vinaigrette taste. i finally just sent the burger back after taking 2-4 bites. my boyfriends brisket sandwich was subpar, he said. i would go back for the craft beer & to support a local place/brewery, however i will never eat there again."}
{"text":"We can here after a long day at a gymkhana. Our waiter was great! He was great at discussing the various beers and their attributes! The food was delicious! It's over an hour from our place, but we will make the drive."}
{"text":"Wife and I were looking for a brewery to try out and ended up going to this one which was near us. Was easy to locate along the main streets. The inside was nice and resembled going to a BJ's. We ended up getting 2 flights of mostly their house beer. Overall the beer was not amazing but was not bad. We tried the house Blueberry, Freak'n Red, House orange ginger Saison, wren stout, helio pale ale, house amber, sun up brown, house brown, freak'n oatmeal and house blonde. There are a lot of varieties to their drink menu which is a big plus when coming during happy hour between 3pm-6pm mon-Friday ($2.00 off house beers, shared plates, well drink and house wines/$1.00 all other drafts) the food we ordered was amazing! The pretzels and beer cheese fondue dip was top notch, soft pretzels and hot cheesy goodness. The fried cauliflower and buffalo sauce on the side was definitely something we will continue to get as well. Our waitress Laura was very attentive and engaging with great recommendations. She would definitely be the one to ask for when coming to this establishment. Overall if your around this area I would recommend you give this place a shot. Thank you Laura!"}
{"text":"Awesome beers, awesome food, and John the tall bartender is the best. I can't speak for the service in the rest of the restaurant, but I've had only great experiences at the bar!   The food is all fantastic, and a lot of it is local, made in house, etc."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good! We went on a Saturday around 1 and it was pretty dead maybe 5 total tables. The beer kept coming but the salad was never refilled, nor was the water. My husband got the pb&j burger and thought it was good but he said it had a little too much peanut butter! I built my own burger and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"This just might be the best \"micro\" brewery in town.  Fantastic beers.  Bonus, great food as well.  Love this place."}
{"text":"First time last night. Was forced to sit in their very uncomfortable booth. Asked for a table, was denied. Our backs hurt. Next asked for a 16 oz draft beer. Nope, can't do that either. The beer was good. The menu was limited, I ordered fish n chips, fish was good, tartar sauce was amazing, fries ok but kinda soggy/ grease. Very tiny serving of coleslaw. Hubs had a burger. He liked it but we ate quickly as our backs were cramping up hard. I think this place is still using the old booths from 12?yrs ago when it was Hayashi sushi joint. Overall--overpriced and never coming back unless I get a REAL CHAIR."}
{"text":"I was super excited to visit this place because I'm all about drinking and eating local.  I'll start on a positive note and say the beer selection and quality of their beers is good.  Tried several of their IPA's and each one was great...even tried the blueberry beer and that was good too.  Now for ALL of the negatives and there were many.  We visited on a Saturday night at dinner time so the place was busy.  We waited about 40 minutes for a table to accommodate seven.  Really no complaints about the time because......it was Saturday night.  However, immediately upon entering you noticed it was extremely stuffy in the building.  I'm not sure how warm it actually was but it was in the 80's....probably 85 degrees if I was guessing.  This was the deal breaker right here.  It's Arizona in the summer!!!!  You can't keep it that warm inside and expect people to be happy.  I thought it was going to get cooler when we got seated....nope!  The dining room area adjacent to the bar was just as warm, if not warmer, than the front door area.  This literally ruined the entire night for us.  We talked the server, who was pretty good actually, and he said the air conditioning was having trouble keeping up because it was \"115 degrees outside.\"  Well....it wasn't 115 degrees outside and even it was you can't keep it that warm in the restaurant.  In addition to the lack of A/C, some genius in charge thought it was a good idea to open the garage door-sized window so that we could hear the live band....and of course get even more of that super hot, humid, monsoon weather inside the restaurant. There was really no excuse for this and for this reason and this reason alone I would never return to this place.  We ordered the pretzels and the Chef's Board as apps.  Both of these were pretty good, but a little overpriced...especially the pretzels because you only get three sticks.  The main courses for us was the Build Your Own Burger and the P.B.&J Burger.  Advertised was all natural Creekstone patties.  I have no idea what Creekstone patties are but I can tell you that this was not a good burger...basically tasteless and I have had much better burgers at multiple fast food chains which is super disappointing.  I was excited for the P.B.&J Burger as it sounds creative and the waiter stated he never gets complaints.  I can tell you without exception that is complete BS!  I eat peanut butter all the time and I can tell you that there was so much peanut butter on this bun it was hard to choke it down without taking a drink of beer after every bite.  I actually was unable to finish the burger because it was that dry and tasteless...except for the never ending supply of peanut butter.  Advertised is a \"peach-jalapeno jelly.\"  I have no idea what that is because I couldn't taste anything other than the ridiculous amount of peanut butter!!  Super interesting idea that they simply were unable to pull off and I would warn anyone about eating this burger because YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.  This place has a cool layout, furniture and overall atmosphere.  However, they must get their menu in order because if you take their beer away there is absolutely nothing to like about this place from a food standpoint.  Oh and please turn on the air conditioning because it's Arizona in August!!"}
{"text":"I checked out State 48 and just ordered a simple burger and fries.  The burger patty itself was delicious, although I do not think the waitress understood what Medium Well (Yes I know you're supposed to eat Well Done for ground beef) meant.  She just asked me \"Pink?\".  Being a food snob, actually kind of irked me.  The rest of the burger and fries was very mediocre.  They need to add at least 3x the lettuce in their burgers and make sure it's actually still crisp to a degree.  Cooking the lettuce on top of the burger removes the crunch sorely needed from a hamburger and makes the topping feel like a wet noodle.  Other than that, I'm sure they'll improve overtime.  Now the real reason anyone should bother coming here is their nice selection of craft brews.  I ordered an Amber, and although it tasted delicious, it tasted exactly like Fat Tire.  Then I went to their Prickly Pear beer, and that actually had a very unique taste to it.  The place still looks too much like Hayashi, but I'll give it time.  The price costs about $1-$2 dollars more than usual, and the beers do add up.  I will need to return here for happy hour and see the prices then.  Until then, State 48 is a wonderful place for beer and food."}
{"text":"This place is EXACTLY what Surprise needed! I got the beer cheese burger..... It's the best ever. The cheese comes on the side so that you can dip every single possible thing into it. GET THE BEER CHEESE!! The Mr. got the Fish Po Boy and loved, girls got the Mac and the pizza, both were so yummy. The atmosphere is so chill and we cannot wait to hit up some spring training games and head over for a delish lunch, dinner or Beers! Angela's Kitchen (the family's other restaurant) is a huge hit but this place is our new favorite spot.  We also had the s'mores and cheesecake!!!! It's so delish!"}
{"text":"I have to say we were so excited to have State 48 open. We waited a few days to come in so they could get their feet wet. My husband and I went in last night. My husband ordered the beer cheese steak sandwich which had a huge piece of fat & gristle in it. I had the carnitas. It was OK but no better then I make at home. The beer was good. When it came time to pay their credit system was down. We waited 20 min and finally asked what was going on. The owner wanted us to just write down our credit card number and leave. We said we did not feel comfortable doing that. He walked away and came back with our number on the bill and wanted us to sign it.  He gave us no other option. He didn't offer us anything so we could wait it out. Not that I was asking for a freebie.  He got angry and said you win the meal is on us,  When asked for the receipt back he ripped it up and threw it at my husband and told him never to return to his business. Of course as you can imagine my husband took offense to this and got upset and raised his voice. He then followed us outside and grabbed the back of my husbands shirt and berated my 73 year old husband calling him a coward and chicken all the way to the car. We did file a complaint with the police and when they went to talk to him he said that if we ever came in again we would be arrested for trespassing. Don't worry Mario Sr.  I will never be back. You lost what could of been a great customer that promotes businesses in Surprise."}
{"text":"The other reviews sum up the negatives pretty accurately.  Not sure if it is management, wait staff, etc...  but the service was the worst I can recall in a long time.  No sense going into all the details though.  I gave it a 3 star rating, but would break it down like this:  Ambiance: 5 Beer: 3 Food: 4 Service: 1  I think I would still maybe go back again, but only to sit outside and just to have a beer. Although, not if I was in a hurry or too thirsty :)"}
{"text":"Best place to get beer in Surprise! It's a super laid back and fun atmosphere. Love the outdoor patio in the evenings. Awesome place!  Honorable mention goes to John the bartender (such a chill guy) and Joseph, the best waiter ever. Joseph definitely has made going to State 48 SO much fun!"}
{"text":"Found via Yelp.  Arrived about 9 pm for late dinner.  Hours rated by Yelp and actual hours were a bit off. We enjoyed a quick meal at the bar.  Fish and chips I believe and it was good.  The beers were good as well and the bartender knew her taps.  She steered me toward a very nice IPA that was actually a house IPA I think.  I tasted others but preferred the one she originally recommended.  It was a really good late eve meal.  I will return."}
{"text":"Delicious beers. Great service, pretty atmosphere. My only complaint are the appetizers are tiny. We ordered the fried cauliflower and pretzel. Cauliflower dish was super tiny."}
{"text":"Just moved here from out of state because of the military. Me and the wife first came here last week for lunch. Food was decent and beer was great but service was dead slow. We thought it was a fluke so returned tonight to have some beers.  Was seated and some time later we got a waitress.  We asked for the mango wheat beer when she arrived to which she responded they where out and took off before I could ask for another. I set a timer for 10min and she still didn't return. We walked out with out getting a beer. Terrible service and will not be returning for a while. Service like that really pisses you off"}
{"text":"Went here this past week, the service, Melanie, was great! She worked hard finding me a beer that might suit me. Actually, liked Freaky, the best. My husband and I split a mushroom burger and sweet potato fries. Next time I'll get my own, as we both enjoyed it. We were with friends and sat at the bar, but also will keep in mind their out door seating for our next visit. This place will be packed during Spring Training for sure. The food was good, maybe just a little pricey for a burger, but we enjoyed ourselves and that is what really counts. So State 48, keep up the good service!"}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of having Shea as our servers and she was absolutely amazing!! We just moved to surprise and will definitely be back often!!! The food was so great everything came out perfect!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I can't give a half star, because this is really 4.5 stars. The beer was great and I would come back for that alone. The food was decent, although it would have been nice if it came out all at the same time. My friend's salad came out way before my pizza. We sat at the bar and had good service. The only major ding is that we had to ask for plates when our appetizer came out instead of the waitress just bringing them to us."}
{"text":"Terrible service! This was our 2nd time here and both times the service has been so bad it's embarrassing. Neither time was the place busy. It took a full 15-20 minutes to have our server greet us and take our drink/food order. (Yes we ordered all at once because we didn't have all night to sit there) My husband ordered fish & chips, myself and our 2 guests ordered pizzas. The fish & chips came out at least a good 10 minutes before our pizzas. Having a gluten allergy you'd think the cook would take pride in making sure they didn't serve regular pizza crust to a customer who specifically stated they needed gluten free. Luckily I recognized the crust and sent it right back. Meanwhile the rest of our party finished their food. I was still waiting. When my pizza finally came out the toppings came  wrong , so rather than waiting another 20 min. I settled. Never once was the meal offered to be comped. The waiters and waitresses were running around scrambling and what seemed to be the manager was delivering food. $125 for a meal and I can honestly say I'd rather have thrown my money out the window as I drove by than to eat at State 48 again! Management needs a full overhaul."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this place 6 Weeks ago and thought we would give them another try to see if they worked out the kinks. We were told at that time they would have their house beers ready in the beginning of September. We stopped by tonight to try one of their home brews and were told they are starting to brew the beer tomorrow. It seems that this place is not going to provide their own brews and keeps telling people it is coming soon. If you are a beer lover, don't waste your time here. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and not impressed. Sorry guys  The good: 1.  Friendly service 2.  Atmosphere is upbeat 3.  Good parking   Changes they should consider: 1. Bathrooms are dirty 2. Draft beer was not very good and had a bad after taste 3. Margherita was not good at all, watery 4. All 4 meals served were not that great, not served according wishes 5. Restaurant was dirty 6. Tables smelled bad (dirty rags) 7. Once meal was served our server was too busy with other tables. I waited for mustard for a long time"}
{"text":"Sub par at best. Service was a little slow and food was generically average. Looking at the nice decor inside gave me the impression that food would be better than it was.  Since your establishment did respond, I will give it another try.  Back when we did eat there we had the southwestern mac n cheese and my husband had the burger."}
{"text":"1st time here. Great atmosphere and decor. The falafel burger and homemade potato chips were delish! John the bartender makes an amazing strawberry mojito! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Love having a brewery here in Surprise; great beer and great food. Only downside for my family is the kids haven't really found anything they like to eat as the food prepped is all homemade and they are not used to that LOL. I Do wish more local breweries were kept on tap but I understand State 48 showcasing their brews. Keep up the awesome job!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and very nice place. Food was good , took a little longer then we were expecting for just burgers. Kids mac and cheese wasn't very good, to gourmet for our little ones"}
{"text":"This was my first visit. I met a friend for happy hour. Decent happy hour deals. The bruschetta of the day was pesto artichoke and was very meh. My red wine was fine. My friend said the sangria was too sweet. The server was nice. The sausage board sausages were tasty. Large restaurant and indoor and outdoor bar areas. I will return and may just need to try other menu items."}
{"text":"We waited for ten minuets before anyone even came to ask if we wanted food or drinks. The cardinals game was a blow out and they refused to change it to a better game for no reason. Service sucked."}
{"text":"Strong beer list with a decent variety. The food was also top notch too. Clean, spacious layout with lots of tv's and a good atmosphere. Service was great too. I'll happily return here - a great addition to the Surprise Areas bar and culinary scene :)"}
{"text":"Awesome service! Our waiter was able to serve our entire section without a hiccup. Great beer selection. Atmosphere is perfect! Food is good but we will be back for the service!"}
{"text":"Oh my! The best burger I have had in a long time. I ordered a burger medium and guess what it came medium. Amazing good too! Beer was excellent I had the the Freedom IPA. I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat. Especially for Surprise which has almost no where good to eat."}
{"text":"Bartender seemed a bit grumpy at first.  Other wise. nice place. The cheesecake was AMAZING. Only complaint was the first couple of beers we ordered were not available"}
{"text":"Sad experience. I really wanted to like this place, I found it and wanted to show my wife a nice dinner. Our waitress took a very long time to take care of us. The food was pretty bad. We're in line at McDonalds because we didn't want to finish, yes it was that bad. I am very frugal and hate to waste but I did not mind leaving my leftovers. When our check came out we were charged for an item we didn't order and had to spend even more time in that place. We will not be back unless someone gives us a gift card and we can't give that away. The employees at McDonald's were more accommodating than State 48, that's pretty pathetic."}
{"text":"We brought our parents, sister, and her young son here for lunch. It's close to their house and we heard the food is decent. Well. The food WAS good, except our waiter quit right in the middle of his shift and management had the worst time recovering from this situation. Our orders were put in and we ended up waiting over 30 minutes. Our waiter never showed back to the table so my husband ended up leaving the table to order and bring more drinks from the bar. After waiting even longer, I flagged down a waiter and told him that we haven't seen the waiter in a long time. Minutes later, the manager, Mario, came to our table and explained that his employee had in fact \"walked\" and that a round of drinks would be on him. He also apologized and provided a new waitress named Nikki who took care of us.  I completely understand when situations like this happen but when we bring our parents along to have a great dining out experience together, it's a little nerve racking.  Not only was the service terrible, but I witnessed a waitress slip and almost bust her ass on spilled water by the front entrance. Didn't clean it up. That could have been a customer.... Aside from the chaos going on with the employees, my fig and prosciutto pizza was dope and my husband loved his pb & j burger. The food is great and because Mario made a full recovery to the best of his abilities, I'm giving this place three stars. We will certainly come back again. They just didn't have a very good day that day."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in last night. Our server was Ashley. She did an incredible job over all. Food came out fast, drinks were brought to the table in a timely manner. Over all we would go back just to have her wait on us. On a side note, it looked like a manager was flirting with a table the entire night, being in the restaurant business it's a little frustrating seeing the person that SHOULD be leading, assisting and checking on all tables rather than trying to get a girls number. But Ashley was great !!!"}
{"text":"Love the beers. Love the pizza. I'm not a big beer drinker but they always have different flavors that are delicious.  I've tried peanut butter beer, chocolate beer, and berry beer. The appetizers are mandatory!"}
{"text":"Our daughter recommended State 48 because it is a favorite of theirs both for the food and the selection of beers.  All four of us went on Friday for happy hour and stayed later.  I don't drink, but was assured by the other three that the beers were great.  Two of us ordered happy hour appetizers as meals and my husband had the Ruben which he said was delicious!  My \"appetizer\" was the chicken and lettuce cups and it was delicious as well!   Sunday night is typically our pizza night so we decided to go there, just the two of us, and try their wood-fired pizza.  Nikki recommended \"The Boss\" and it was fantastic!  The crust is home made with beer and is thin, but not like a cracker crust---and I am not usually a crust eater!  The menu says that they make their mozzarella fresh daily as well, and it shows!  The seasonings were perfection.   Quite possibly the best pizza I have ever had!   So glad we found this gem!  We will be back frequently!"}
{"text":"This place is good.  We started out with Ceviche and it was yummy.  I got the Ahi Tuna and it was delish! AND... my husband got the Fried Chicken with Cornbread that was life-changing. Now I know I've said that before but I really don't throw that out Willy Nillly. I could eat just the Cornbread for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the rest of my life.   Stop whatever you are doing and get here ASAP!!!   Came back tonight and tried different things . Started out with a chopped salad that had a little spice to it and it was Soooooo Goooood!!!  I had the Fish Tacos for my main course and it was DeLish!!!  Love this place"}
{"text":"Have visited State 48 Brewery twice.  Both visits were early in the evening, and they were out of the pretzels and cheese fondue along with the s'mores on both visits.  No apologies were given.    Our first visit was the week they opened.  Our waiter seemed to lack training and was unfamiliar with the menu. We decided to give it one more try.  Sadly, the hostesses were unprofessional - talking among themselves and ignoring guests.  We had the same waiter and he had improved.  The food was good had fish and chips.  We are excited to get a new restaurant in Surprise, but do hope that the management works closely with the staff to improve service."}
{"text":"I would have to say this is probably the best place to have a pint and some great food in Surprise. They have at least 15 beers on tap and a great menu. Simple food done great. Ate at the bar and the service was on point. Mandy was upbeat personable and new the tap list and menu well.   Our most recent visit brings this place slowly down. They have taken the fish tacos off the menu and now have the worst fish and chips I have ever eaten in my life. They put an over abundance of thyme in the batter. I had to search long and hard to find a recipe that had cod and thyme in it. We have eaten fish and chips all over the world and never had it so bad!  They also have two kitchens so you may or may not eat at the same time as others at your table.   The service is great so they get a point for that."}
{"text":"We headed in for lunch on a weekday, and were seated right away. Our server's name was Chris, and he was very prompt and courteous. We each ordered pizza and shared and it was fantastic! The Diavallo and the Boss were SO good. The Margherita wasn't bad either. I can't wait to go back and try some more!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst place to eat in Surprise. I have had 4 seriously poor meals in about a 2 month period. I kept hoping it would get better, but not. The owner is very rude, the seats are very uncomfortable. I can't see how they are in business.  You never see but a few people dining there, and this is peak season. I asked for a burger with no pink, and received an overcooked hockey puck with no flavor, crappy and cold....shoestring fries are bad. They are charging $8 per beer for beer  you can buy in a 6-pack for $13.....so they are making $48 off of a 6 pack. That should be illegal. Last time I was there I had the fish. One piece was over cooked, and one was way under cooked. You can get good beer anywhere, but the food at this place is terrible! Absolutely the worst!"}
{"text":"The brews here were all great! At least the 7 I gave a try:) Don't forget to have the pretzels!!"}
{"text":"The service was great he was always checking to see if we needed anything. The food had great flavors I will be going back and the noise level was good too cause the kids can be loud . Also the kids were able to watch them prep and cook the pizza ."}
{"text":"When visiting surprise check this place out!  I had the PB&j burger ! Yum yum give me some! With a Cesar Salad and a glass of Chop Shop Cab! Mel rocks it behind the bar great customer service ! You go Girl!"}
{"text":"Our first visit and we really enjoyed beer and I thought the decor was fun.  Loved the 48 State art work!  The fish tacos were amazing.  The Ceviche was great but the chips were stale. The service was great.  Then the ladies room.... It needs to be cleaned.  Not gross but not clean.   We will come back!"}
{"text":"The hostess told us she could not seat us because the kitchen close at 9pm... It was 830pm. After a slightly rocky start, we were seated and the manager apologized for this blip. The food was delicious and the server was attentive. We ended up leaving with a growler and a good experience."}
{"text":"I've debated about going to this new hot spot since it opened, hearing mixed reviews. But today we tried it out.  We were seated quickly in a booth, but on my side there was a considerable amount of cushion missing, so I literally felt like I was sitting in a hole, in a sofa. We started to order beer, but of course the one we ordered was out of stock. So that was fun. We ordered an appetizer, the pretzel with cheese and mustard. It took a while to come out, considering that it's not a large serving. The pretzels were LOADED with salt. We brushed that right off, and enjoyed them. My BF ordered the veggie burger and I the Sonoran burger. My burger was cooked medium, the way I like it, however the meat was cheap and greasy. I lost my appetite at the sight of the puddle of grease. I also found my burger very salty and over-powered with the goat cheese. My BF had to wait a good 15 minutes before the waitress appeared to ask her for toppings, since his burger only came with goat cheese and bbq sauce. He asked for mayo and pickles, but the pickles were the sweet pickles and his burger was also very salty. I wanted to be excited about the fries, I like the cut, but again, I think the salt shaker fell into those as well. I did not finish my food, which is a big deal. I always clear my plate. I left feeling bloated, full and uncomfortable on a small portion of food. 2 burgers. 1 appetizer. $35. We didnt even order drinks, we only drank water!  I'm not sure if we'll return. Again, as so many times before, we've been disappointed. Still waiting for a great spot to eat a drink at in Surprise. Maybe one day..."}
{"text":"While out with the family we wanted to try something new but stay close to home. We decided to try State 48 since it always looked busy when we pass by and we're pleasantly surprised. We had a few minute wait to be seated but not much. We started with the sausage appetizer and it was amazing. Great choices for anyone."}
{"text":"Amazing! Fun atmosphere, huge portions and yummy food. Only downside is it is not necessarily kid friendly but maybe that's actually a good thing."}
{"text":"Pub style food is above average.  The pizzas are made in a wood burning oven. I do not believe they brew their own beer yet, but do have several local options on tap.  Cool feel to the place and usually pretty busy. Have been here several times and like the pizza & fish & chi"}
{"text":"Servers were/are friendly.  Beer is wonderful.  Pizza is solid.  Rest of food is so-so.  Struggling to give it three stars.  Crystal, our waitress, friendly and accommodating - she's worth a second visit/try..."}
{"text":"Such a great place to have lunch or dinner!  Everything I've ordered thus far has been delicious! All of their servers are professional and friendly every time I have eaten here!"}
{"text":"Great place! The pizza's are amazing.. Crystal was our waitress and she was awesome, very attentive and came by our table often to check on us.."}
{"text":"UPDATE (9/27/17): raised from 3 star to 4 star.   We went back a few days ago for the pizza and to enjoy the patio. Again, they had an issue with our order. Wife orders pasta with no mushroom. It showed up and appeared to have none, but there were a few mushroom pieces found. She got a skin rash immediately. We sent the food back. While the waitress was new, she did an excellent job handling the situation. The manager or owner who came by also showed a tremendous amount of care about the situation and even offered us a free pizza and beer.  I've raised it to 4 star because I was impressed by the level of customer service both the waitress and manager showed for the error compared to our previous visit where we felt brushed off.   Happy to see this change in customer service.   Prior review:  Another local spot I really want to love and just can't. Wife's food came out at least 10 minutes before everyone else's pizza. She felt rude eating in front of everyone so waiting as it got cold for everyone else's pizza to come out. When it did, we were one pizza short. They messed mine up so started it over. After everyone was done eating my pizza arrived.  Manager came over and didn't apologize, but explained it was human error. Clearly. Offered to take something off the bill, which they did, a measly $4.00 discount!  Then we waiting for the to go cheese cake after all bills paid for another 10 minutes. When that finally came out and we started to leave they decided to start taking all of our plates away and clean the table as we are trying to exit.   Been here multiple times, with each with multiple issues. Things do not seem to be getting better.  What is saving this place for me is the pizza and the right side of the restaurant. If you sit in the left side, it's like feeling you got put at the loser table. No idea why they didn't use a consistent theme, but the left side (by the pizza station) seems dull and boring. Right side is where it's open and more modern.  Also, something about the front entrance is off. They have a wall by the waitress station that shouldn't be there so you can see into the bar area. It feels closed off.   If it wasn't for excellent pizza this would be a 2 star review."}
{"text":"Great brewery and eatery! Have been here multiple times and it's always clean, never a long wait, food arrives relatively quick and is delicious! Food is very fresh and reasonably priced, beer is pretty decent."}
{"text":"We had a positive experience here this past weekend. Great atmosphere and bag toss is always a good nice. We tried the State 48 burger with fries (amazing ranch!!!). They had Helio Basin blackberry wheat which is a must try. This place is worth giving a shot for sure!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give more stars just because the food is amazing. However, the service today was absolutely terrible. Our server must have been high, he messed up several things we asked for,  screwed up or flight sampler, had to ask for napkins about 3 times, as well as a to go box towards the end. Then as we were on the way out, the girl near the shirts was scrolling through her phone when my husband asked her a question about the shirts available, she didn't even look up from her phone and answers him with \"yep\". She didn't offer to open the cabinet for a better look at the ones there or anything, so we just left.  I was very disappointed. The first time we came here, the service was amazing. Today,...not so much."}
{"text":"Good food and very different beers brewed. I tried the orange and blueberry beers and liked them both. They have a mango been too but it was not available when I was there last. I will be back to try that one and I hear it is very good also. Food and service at the bar is great."}
{"text":"I have been to this place w/ various ppl multiple times since this place opened. It started out ok, with the beer being ok, and the food leaving something to be desired. Particularly for the price point. Note the exception to this USED to be the smokin' Smores dessert, which was amazing.   Sadly, they have since changed their menu & modified their offerings. Including the dessert we loved. And while the changes may not have been great in number, the changes have affected their quality. We used to enjoy their beer offerings.   We were also at their brunch which we enjoyed & they only offered briefly. We discovered this b/c the next time we went for brunch, we found out it was stopped.  Our last visit was today (2/9/18) & we went for happy hour. We didn't order food b/c the quality is not what one should expect for the price. To our amazement, the beer quality has also dropped. We used to enjoy their beer and they are the closest craft beer place to where we live.   They are consistently busy, which I can only attribute to them being the only game in town for craft beer and a slightly higher end place. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this place as the food quality has never been good enough and the beer quality had also taken a dive."}

{"text":"Okay, Here we go. My wife and I went here today for lunch. Staff was great. Beer and wine, no problem. Had some buffalo chips to start off. Like the spice and flavor. We both ordered the chop salad. My wife had it with salmon and I had the chicken. The salmon had a questionable smell and my chicken seemed to be left over warmed up. It was dry. Normally we are happy with State 48. This time the food left us less than super happy. These two food items have caused me to only give them 2 stars. Will go back, but may have to be cautious about what I order."}
{"text":"( I didn't have any Beer, so my review is based on the food)  I had a hamburger with salad, Its was Good but kinda of expensive.  I mean I wouldn't put above tru burger or hoppdaddy but its a good place IF you like Beer.  I think other options can be found in the area for less or equal.  It's a great place overall."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on a Sunday - fairly busy so short wait.  It's awfully dark inside and noisy in the bar area.  Kind of a 'musty' smell as well.  Harvest salad was very good - lots of spinach and toppings were plentiful- very lightly dressed.  Burger and fries were good as well - bun was not heavy and burger cooked as requested.  I'm a creme brûlée fan so tried the special of the day which was ginger.  Ginger was hard to detect but that is better than overpowering!  Would try State 48 again.  Lots of items on the menu and anxious to experience the outside seating."}
{"text":"Pizza oven, brewery distillery and outdoor seating all open. This place is great, been back several times and I really enjoy it here. The food and staff have been great I can complain finally something 'not franchise' pheww!"}
{"text":"INCOMPETENT MANAGEMENT: We're from San Diego, so fully immersed in the Craft Brew scene. This Brewery, as seems by other reviews on Yelp, has management issues & that was evident in our visit.   First, we arrived early on a Sunday eve & there was a 45-minute wait - although there were many empty tables (Strike 1) - lack of planning on behalf of the management.   So we sat at the bar & were handed menus by who someone washing glasses who we assumed was a bartender or barback. He informs us they were out of their Stout (ok this happens at breweries sometimes) I was in the mood for a dark beer since it had been a cold, rainy day. Then he tells us they are out of their Porter and also out of their Brown - so no dark beers on tap at all! (Strike 2 for that - generous, should be 2 strikes, :)) At a brewery, how do you run out of all your dark beers at once? Lack of planning & good management. So the only other dark beer they had was bottled, 12-ounce, from an unknown to me source. I don't go to a brewery, especially to a Disneylandish brewery, & put up with over-priced, underwhelming food, to drink bottled beer, but alas, had I any other choice? So I ordered the beer - 12 ounces of bottled beer poured in a 16-ounce glass - so it looked 1/4 empty - & the taste was bleh. I asked the bartender if I was stuck w/ it or if it could be replaced (seeing they had nothing dark on tap I could taste prior to ordering) She was great & said \"no problem.\"  Next thing the other 'bartender' comes to me, shoves a menu in front of me, points to the small print & says, \"says here we can't reimburse for bottled or canned beers.\" I said \"the other bartender already said it was ok.\" He said, \"I'm the manager\" so no reimburse or replacement. I asked, \"even if you're completely out of dark beers on tap?\" He said nothing I can do & walked away. (Strike 3)  I understand rules & policies. But the brusque way in which he said it & completely failing to offer anything else to make the experience better, even, what, a $1 off of an appetizer, anything would have shown an effort - it just seemed he just didn't care about the customer, but more about saving a buck and adherence to his rules.   We closed out the tab & left. Maybe I expected too much, but a reasonable selection at a brewery and/or a good attitude & willingness to make right on things gone wrong can go a long way for a successful restaurant/pub/brewery.   Thankfully, we're back in San Diego where our selection of amazing breweries is almost limitless...sorry for those of you living on the NW side of Phoenix...we feel for ya when this is the best you have in the area."}
{"text":"After tonight wont go back to this restaurant. Staff overcharged for drinks and charged wrong prices. Owner supports staff. Wont be back."}
{"text":"I have been here probably 10 times now since discovering it last year.  I have only been there one time when the service was just \"ok\" and all the other times was stellar.  I usually always get a flight to try some beers out first before ordering my main squeeze for the night.  The food is always amazing, no seriously, amazing.  I don't leave 5 star reviews very often at all and I haven't been drinking today at all - so you're getting honesty, I promise... actually, I'm pretty honest when I have been drinking too.  I like to take my kids with me and sit on the patio (when it's NOT summer time).  They have corn hole games to play and the bar is accessible from inside and outside (when it's not summer).  I love it here, got the T-shirt to prove it."}
{"text":"Great brew, ambience!!!  Our waitress/server Crystal was absolutely awesome!!!  The service from all staff was second to none, and the food selection and taste was super yummy!    Sooooooo happy to have you here on Surprise, AZ!!! :)"}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this place.  Met a friend here to exchange Xmas gifts and have some lunch and a couple beers! Our server was fantastic, cheery and offered samples of some of the beers! We ordered the pretzel appetizer and a pizza to share! Well... they came back and told us that they were out of pizza dough? What...really! That's a big part of your menu! So after choosing other menu items. We were not especially thrilled with our choices....the food was just so so! If We are to come back. I hope there would be better food options and have the ingredients on hand! So overall I give 3 stars.  Based on the service and the beer! Improve the food and I will give more stars on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Visiting from New Hampshire and I went to this place 4 times. I loved it. Salads were great and I loved the beer. Chicken wings were mushy but other than that, great beer, food, atmosphere and staff."}
{"text":"We are 45 minutes away from home. I just moved mother in law into her home in Surprise.  I'm starving, wife is starving, newborn is crying, he wants boob juice, we luckily stumble upon this brewery.   Extremely pleased with this place! Cool laid back atmosphere, bathrooms clean, very nice and professional waitress- Shelby T, the food we got was great, service was on point, and the beers we tried are awesome!   I know the spot we are going to go when we go to her mom's house now!   It's a very good place and I don't think you can go wrong here.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I come here almost everyday when I'm in town visiting family because there's nothing else to do at night in Surprise. It's the best bar in the area. The beer selection is great. For a bar pie, the pizza is pretty good. The charcuterie board is really nice for sharing. Can't go wrong with pretzels and cheese sauce for dipping.   Service is better at the bar than at one of the tables. The bartenders are so lovely here! They're attentive, friendly and knowledgeable about the food and beverage menus.   Table service was lacking when I was last there. Our server didn't write down our order, so she forgot to put half of it in. At least she told us instead of blaming the kitchen, which is good I guess. Most of us got our food, but the two who had only ordered salad and fries didn't get them until the rest of us were done eating. It was awkward service. Our server did not bring us settings at all. It wasn't busy, so I'm not sure what the issue was. A bartender who recognized us and stopped to say \"hi\", brought settings over for the table. Not her job to take care of a table like this, but it was nice that she did."}
{"text":"To be fair, I guess this is a place one would go to for drinks or dinner, but not for breakfast.  I wasn't impressed with my breakfast at all.  I had bacon & eggs with a \"homemade\" biscuit and home fries.  The eggs were over cooked, the bacon was undercooked (per my order) and the biscuit was very heavy.  The potatoes were good. The coffee was good. I may try it again for something other than breakfast."}
{"text":"We did date night at State 48 Brewery and had a great time with friends.  The atmosphere was fun, casual and different.  The cauliflower wings were great, what a nice surprise of flavor.  The sausage board was great too, a nice array of different tastes.  For dinner we had the pork chop, which I was told was very good, the brussels and bacon pizza, which was very good (I snuck a slice from our friend).  My wife had the mushroom burger and loved it.  She was really looking forward to the sweat potato fries, but they came out extra salty.  We simply asked if she could get another order; no problem at all, the fries were out in less than 5 minutes.  I had the carnitas cemita and it was yummy.  We even did a brew board and tried 6 different beers.  We did 3 house beers and 3 other beers.  All good, but the house beer was very good.  Overall we had a great nigh there.  The service was great (Katelynd  with a 'd'), not too noisy, even on a busy Friday night.  We felt the prices were very fair and the quality of food was really great.  All 4 of us kept commenting on what a great place with great food it was.  We found our new go-to place for good food and fun!  Next time I want to hang out on the patio, that looks like a great place to be.    Now if they had some live music,  some acoustic cover tunes on the patio, I'd be there almost every week! (hint hint to the owner!!!!!)"}
{"text":"Good food and many varieties of beer.  Fun place to have lunch or dinner. I encourage you to try this place."}
{"text":"Ordered the tots, artichoke dip, and the beer cheese burger.  The tots and artichoke dip were fantastic.  The burger needed more seasoning, but the homemade bun was solid.  The fries were even more solid.  The beer cheese was even more solid.  And the sound of freedom IPA made my day.  Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"My wife and I have wanted to try this place since moving to Surprise, and we finally had the chance without our little one.  I tried their house beer, the Lost Dutchman, which was good, but when they use that same beer on their fish 'n chips, that's where it shines, the best fish I have had in a long time.  The beer cheese is fantastic as well, as well as the sandwich, although the meat was sliced a little thick for my wife's taste.  Service was very nice and polite, but it did take a while to get our check.  Will likely dine here again!"}
{"text":"First time here. Pleasantly surprised. I prefer this place over the old sushi place that used to be here.  Food came out fast. Service was decent. Price is reasonable.  Husband got the Carnitas sandwich. He really liked it a lot. Full of flavor.  I got the Peach pizza, and I actually really liked it a lot too. It tastes freshly made. The crust is really good. Reminds me a little of Cibo pizza or Grimaldi's.  We will be back to try more items."}
{"text":"Last night we visited the State 48 Brewery for the second time. The food was still so delicious!! The last time I was there I had the Butternut Squash and Gorgonzola pizza and it was to die for. I just had to have it again last night! Still amazing. My husband enjoyed the Beer Cheesesteak and WOW! So delicious! The seasonal beer selection was outstanding too. We look forward to coming here for our third time. So happy that the west side finally has a brewery with great food and a modern-chic environment!  Highly recommend, just remember there are still a few service kinks to work out. Other than that - superb!"}
{"text":"Went out with family for a relaxing evening.  State 48 didn't disappoint.  The server couldn't be nicer despite having many satanic tattoos and symbols on her. The food was really delicious.  I had the steak and romaine lettuce wedge salad . Plus chicken wings with habanero jelly . Like I mentioned the server , service and atmosphere was pleasant and the food was delicious.  I just found those satanic symbols to be a little too much for me a week after Easter.  She was friendly and helpful with the menu and extremely courteous and very happy.  I'd recommend State 48 to anyone who wants a relaxing delicious meal."}
{"text":"Found a really nice gem of a place in Surprise, Arizona. State 48 Brewery is a great place to unwind and sample some awesome local brews!  Staff are efficient and friendly and eager to ensure their patrons feel like family. Food is very tasty and reasonably priced and the beer is served ice cold! Do yourself a favor and give this gem a try!"}
{"text":"REALLY dig this place. I came here with my roommates for dinner and we all got the pb&j burger. It sounds weird but you MUST try it. It's a game changer. They have a great selection of unique beers and the fries are bomb af too.  The staff is really not that great tbh, they forget your order, drop your order, seemingly don't give a sh!t about your order...   But this is the type of place where you love the atmosphere, and the food, and the beer SO much you kinda just deal with the staff being a hot mess.   Place gets poppin around dinner time too, so plan accordingly because you'll probably have to wait.  But I insist - it's really worth it! ------------------------------------ Ok I'm updating my review because I came back with bae today and service was waaaaay better thanks to our phenomenal waitress Nikki!  Also we tried the veggie burger and it was hardy, juicy, and flavorful - literally the best one I've had. Bae agrees. Nikki suggested adding marshmallow fluff so I'm def gunna try that next time, fuq yeah! ---------------------------------- OK we went back again and I tried the PB&J burger with the veggie patty and marshmallow fluff and Nikki was right DAT ISH WAS FIIIIIIIIIIRE. Also they had a cherry sour beer that was pretty good."}
{"text":"Good brews, and our meals were exceptional. Sweet potato fries appetizer was more than enough for two, and were very flavorful compared to those I have had elsewhere... THE MARSHMALLOW DIP WAS AWESOME! Wife had a Hot Italian sandwich, I ate the leftovers the next day, so I can say it was extremely good. I had the beer cheese philly (I think thats what it was called), it was good, not GREAT, but good.   We saw a few deserts travelling through the restaurant, they looked good, as did the wood fired pizza, but we can only eat so much in one trip. lol We will be back!  Happy hour had discounts on appetizers and their brews, EXTREMELY good buy if  you want a solid craft brew at a domestic price.   Place was clean and modern, had plenty of TVs in the bar area, and sported a nice looking outdoor/patio area. This spot is worth frequenting!"}
{"text":"We were visiting our daughter in Surprise Arizona and found this gem. We were sat right away, we decided to sit outside as it was very loud in doors. We were very happy we decided to sit outside as we found out they had a nice family area for people with kids. Our waiter was great he was a wealth of information when we were deciding what beers to try. We ended up doing two flights of beer and trusted is judgment complete. We were not disappointed, every one of the beers we tried were good. We all agreed we would get appetizers verse dinner as the meals look huge that they were give to customers. Also leaves more room for beer hee, hee.  We ordered the Salmon, artichoke, spinach dip and it was out of this world.I was skeptical at first but glad we ordered it. We also had to try the pretzels and beer cheese sauce with all the great reviews. My only issue I had on this is that there could be a little less salt on the pretzels other than that the pretzels were made fresh and served hot and the beer cheese sauce was so good you could just eat it alone with a spoon. The totchos are a munchies dream come true, all cheesy and topped with loads of bacon. All are must try's, if I was not so full I would have loved to try other items on the menu. We will be back no if and's or buts."}
{"text":"Been here five minutes with our torn unsafe plastic menus. Update to come... maybe. Fourth person just walked by. Fifth person was stopped by my wife and was asked \"are you our server\"? She actually said \"no, but I guess I can be\"!  After she left, Voila a different guy just walked up after seven minutes and said sorry for the wait. Now we wait for the food. Well, the cheese board was basically just thrown together, the garlic break wasn't toasted, it was just drizzled with garlic butter. The butter was dripping off the board and on to the corn and apricot jelly. Bad combination... the old fashioneds didn't come till after we tried to cancel them. The cauliflower was delicious but by the time we waited for the hibiscus chipotle sauce to arrive, their was only two pieces left. The service was horribly slow, of course he blamed it on the kitchen. Too bad, the drinks and cauliflower would have warranted a return, but the lack of service fixed that."}
{"text":"Good beer selection if you drink I don't. Food was horrible. Service was ok but they need better food selections. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars for State 48. First off this is a much needed restaurant in the Surprise area and I hope we get more like it out here soon.   We've made at least 5 visits at this point and think it's safe to write a review now. If you like to grab an appetizer I say go w/ the pretzels and beer cheese- this will work for kids and adults. I've tried multiple burgers, love the beer cheese burger and I usually add blue cheese crumbles to whichever one I go with. I haven't been dissapointed with a burger yet. The wife n kids all like the pizza. It's brick oven style w/ a pretty thin crust and multiple styles to choose from. I've had the pasta dish as well and it was delicious...it was swimming in sauce so if you don't like it that way you may want to say something when ordering. The beer selection is great and I typically go w/ a flight of 5 different options or a State 48 blonde or lager. You can grab a Growler to go as well. For Surprise residents it's a must and for Phoenix it's still worth the drive."}
{"text":"Getting a beer here now with a girlfriend and it's amazing! They're busy but the staff is upbeat and really makes you a priority. Love the beer selection as well! Crystal came up and asked us how everything is and started a conversation with us. Really personable and wonderful! Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Prices, IMO, on draft brews are a wee bit on the high-side outside of happy hour. State 48 may be a respected brewery, sure, but it seems they're taking advantage to the no-competition lifestyle in Surprise and basically the entire West Valley for that matter.  Foodwise, they have some tasty eats. State 48 Burger? Juicy and very tasty. Turkey Reuben? One of my favorites--delicious and lean since it's turkey not beef. Service, unfortunately, is on the slow side. Servers are relatively slow in general, and even the initial greet and \"start off\" is seriously delayed. In terms of service quality, this is where State 48 can definitely improve. Overall, however, I'm glad State 48 is here in Surprise. It's a welcome establishment to keep in the back pocket."}
{"text":"Sometimes the pizza comes out burnt and other times not done enough.  Waiter Dan never came back for refills or to ask how the food was.  Need to be more consistent with the food preparation."}
{"text":"bummed out. My last review of 2 stars meant State 48 had promise and potential. It fell flat. Now the weird thing is that the place was packed. People must love it. My party of 6 waited an hour and 20 min to be served. The hostess seemed clueless but, no issues with that. Good things come to those who wait! Or not. The service was sub standard. The food was brought out in 10 minute intervals to insure someone at the table didn't have food and the others waited while their meals got cold. The beers was good which is important for a brewery but the margaritas were thrown together and served without salt. (not a deal breaker but salt is necessary with traditional margs). The pizza was surprisingly good. Just cold because we waited 20 minutes for others to get their meals. The rest of the food was just OK. The deal is, a lot of people think this place is great or it could be a case of stockholm syndrome. Either way, i wont be returning."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but everything about our experience was disappointing. Our server never refilled our waters nor did she check on us once except to ask if we wanted dessert. The state 48 burger was disgusting and the \"jam\" that was on it was literally hard as a rock and I couldn't even cut through my burger! We complained to the waitress who had the manager come speak to us about it and all he had for us was excuses from the cook, he didn't even offer me a new meal-very disappointing. Also the flouress torte was sad and tastless. The pizza was good but no better than anywhere else."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch today at the State 48 Brewery. The staff was friendly & helpful.  The food is good & well prepared.  It was served promptly & was brought to the table fresh & hot.  The decor & ambience are interesting & fun.  Loved the music!   Give the Pretzel & fondue cheese a try.  The mustard served with it is exceptional.  The Fish & Chips were delicious.  Nice fresh white fish with a nice tasting batter.  It is served with a tasty Cole Slaw and a Tartar Sauce with a light spicy kick to it that compliments the Fish & Chips.   Nice selection of Beers too!  Yes we will go back again !  Happy to see a nice Brewery & Restaurant open here in Surprise. Hoping they do well!"}
{"text":"State 48 Brewery located near the construction site of Bell and Grand a mega mess for many of the businesses and shoppers of Surprise, AZ..  Looking forward to its completion!! Here you will enjoy very good service indeed. It is the best part of visiting State 48. Food is \"good\". Atmosphere is really nice and upscale in the affordable realm. Relaxing.. ALL EXCEPT the portrait of the Saddest Cow Ever on the wall. A nine foot mural, you can't NOT see it in your face doey-eyed white cow that looked like it's entire family was just slaughtered a moment earlier. Whomever the artist was can capture that level of sadness. Kudos. If that kind of thing does not bother you while you order a burger or steak then you must have and iron stomach. Oh, I almost forgot. Pardon me. One visit I ordered a glass of wine and it was presented about a quarter of the way full. Noticeable to us that it was SKIMMPY on the pour. Hum. Paying a premium for a mere glass of wine, they could at least give a decent pour. Heavens knows that the charge will pay for the whole bottle! Nice menu of different categories to choose from.  Still searching for a wonderful steak/burger house."}
{"text":"I have given State 48 multiple shots. Sometimes the food is amazing. Sometimes it's mediocre. But in my opinion, if you provide good service, mediocre food can fly. Unfortunately, their service is a joke. Honestly, the owner/owners bit off WAY MORE than they could chew.. and it CONSISTENTLY shows."}
{"text":"My husband customized his own brunch dish today. Bubbas's Eggs Benedict is what he will call it. English muffin,  2 brats split and crisped up on the flat top, poblano hollandaise sauce and chimichurri sauce over the top. It was so good. The chimichurri blended with the brat so well. The Hollandaise sauce gave the dish a silky and creamy texture. I was out ordered again. We started with the orange glazed cinnamon rolls. Ridiculous. Super moist. Glaze is sweet but the orange flavor cuts it well. I had the steak and eggs. It came with the chimi sauce which is excellent, not spicy just full of flavor, lots of herbs. The home style potatoes were cooked very uneven due to wide range of size. Knife cuts need some practice. The service is always on point here, above the standard by far. Website and Yelp need to be updated saying you have brunch. I like this place."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, good drinks, great food, and down to earth staff! We love coming to State 48 Brewery!"}
{"text":"Ok so we wanted to order the sausage board but it didn't have cheese on it but the chefs board did.  So since we knew they had cheese we asked our server if we could order the sausage board but add cheese to it for an extra charge. Now get this, the owner told our server NO!  How stupid is this guy?   This was our 3rd time and now our last time here.  Imagine that, customer asks to pay for cheese in a restaurant and is told NO.  Amazingly stupid!! On a positive note our server was great. Then he tells us it is his last night. Smart guy"}
{"text":"So on this Labor Day weekend my wife and I decided to make the drive to try State 48 Brewery on Saturday 9/2/2017. We consider ourselves seasoned Craft Beer Aficionados.  We have visited breweries all over AZ, WA, CA, CO, NV and ID as well as the Caribbean. We believe in supporting the Local breweries and I feel that when I walk in I want to drink that brewery's beers! Which we did and they had 15 of their own beers on tap! I had 1 of their American Brown and 2 of their AK-48 and the 2 my wife had (blood orange) were really really good. With that being said when my wife asked our waitress if there was any specials she said no so my wife pointed out that printed on their menu it said $2 off State 48 beers 11AM to 5PM on Sat/Sun. The waitress said that they don't tell her any of the specials. My thought was isn't that her job to find out what they are to serve the customers better? The AK-48 was out of sight,  however, when they brought my second AK-48 the glass was not filled to the top. I asked the server why it was not filled to the top and she explained it is a 16 ounce tulip glass and you only get a 13 ounce pour. I was shocked when I asked if the owner knows about that and she said yes,  he'd rather leave them out and didn't really care if it looks like they are cheating their customers. Her explanation could have been delivered to the customer more diplomatically. Before we left I decided to get a growler fill of the AK-48 and I had my small bag cooler that they filled with ice to keep the growler cold. I opened the cooler this to morning to prep for the day to find they only filled the growler half way! $21 for a growler fill is a little much and it's not about the money (we don't mind that), however if you are going to put a great product out you need to train your bartender how to fill growlers and glasses properly. We do not plan in returning to this brewery.  It is unfortunate because they do have an amazing selection of beers. However, feeling we have been cheated out of beers for which we paid left a sour taste in our mouths."}
{"text":"Last night was the third time I've been to State 48 Brewery and it's been a hit and miss every time. I love their roasted beet salad, but last night, it was a big disappointment. If I'm paying $9 for a salad, make it worth my money. The salad seemed smaller in portion this time and it was overly dressed. I'll still give them a chance again, only because their brews are good. I'm from LA and at first, this place was comparable to places I've been to in LA, but now, it's just another AZ restaurant trying to make it."}
{"text":"Holy cow! We were driving in the neighborhood and decided to stop for a new place, I am so happy we chose here! EVERYTHING is fantastic! We had the buffalo chips, brisket sandwich, beer cheese burger, mango wheat beer, white tank wheat, and sweet potato soufflé with marshmallow. This might be a new fave place! I will drive the 10 miles to get to it again. And my server, Levi, was SUPERIOR! So knowledgeable, had the best suggestions, and super friendly. I would give Levi and State 48 10 stars if I would!"}
{"text":"Tried to sit at the bar last week on a Friday night and way too busy so came back a week later and an hour earlier--4:00 so we found two seats and settled in since we had until 6 to take advantage of the $2 off beers and shared plates (c'on, with all that pizza dough availability, there could easily be some doughy pizza bites, mini pizzas, etc. for some low-cost options). Availability of beer flights was only known by seeing them being served, not because they were listed on the menu or the board; for a brewery that info should be easily accessible and unfortunately no discount on these during Happy Hour (why not?!)  Also, no descriptions of beer (except for ABV and IBU, but I'm trying to learn about various hops and flavors) so had to keep asking the server (tough since pace was so busy there was no time for any chattiness, so didn't want to keep disturbing, plus, having to keep asking for info that should be easily accessible is annoying)--there are numbers on the flight tray, but no correlation with listing on menu or board (why not?). Had to ask server since at least 3 of them looked same: yellowish haze, so he had to lift them up to sniff them! So I'm supposed to remember or bring a notepad? One of them turned out to be a new release that wasn't even on the board yet. But the beers were good and I was smitten with the mango pepper one and made sure I told the brewmeister who was pleasant and appreciative.  The pizza menu was delightfully creative and we got the Brussels and Bacon: applewood bacon, brussel sprouts, roasted corn, and gorgonzola. The wood-fired crust was was crisp yet chewy, but when tasted by itself, had no distinct flavor--for a beer based dough I expected a hint of sourdoughy fermented delight. The toppings could have been brought closer to the edges so there wouldn't have been such a large section of dryness. The corn and the bacon were really the only flavors, so have no idea what the sauce was, but did taste garlic, but there was no creamy texture, hence the dryness I mentioned earlier was noticeable indeed. The Brussel sprouts were chopped so finely, they could have been anything--a few actual slices would have added to the appearance. Could not taste the gorgonzola which was the flavor I was most looking forward to. More of all the toppings were necessary too--very skimpy. Am glad they use local ingredients where possible, including homemade mozzarella, but I'd like to actually have enough of it to taste. For $13 and no leftovers, I'm more inclined to Papa Murphy's artisan white pizza with chicken and artichoke on a garlicky sauce base for c. same price and leftovers next time I've a hankering for a unique pie. Lively atmosphere, esp. around the bar--maybe have a second bar since that seems to be where most people want to sit and it would speed up the drink service which the people at the little tables were complaining about. Nice there's outside seating and also quieter dining room seating as well. I'm definitely going back, but might need some enticing like a coupon to precipitate it...."}
{"text":"This is the place to be on a Friday or Saturday night. It is open late! The beer selection is fantastic and they have ok food, they are known for there pizza which is good. I gave two stars because the service sucks. You could sit at the bar for 10 min and have the servers all walk past you and not get your order, and then ask or talk to someone else right next to you. This has happened to me the last two times and it's not good service, am I invisible? I go when everywhere else is closed not because I want too."}
{"text":"One of our worst dining experiences ever! The well-done burger we ordered arrived and was rare at best. The fries were greasy and slimy. The waiter apologized about the french fries when two of my family members complained about them. He brought us a side order which looked very much the same way greasy slimy and limp. If I could give it zero stars I would!  Don't go to this restaurant if you intend to eat."}
{"text":"I don't even want to press one star for this establishment. My family just had our viewing of my beloved nephew, a local firefighter Capitan, who was taken from us too soon. We had made arrangements to have our family meet here after. We just arrived to to be told we didn't tell them how many people or the time that they basically can't give us their time. We would have to wait. This is not how to treat your community State 48. This grieving family was taken in with open arms and top knotch professionalism at BROOKSIDE.    Wake up management, because this is not stopping at Yelp."}
{"text":"We were there on Saturday night....place was packed, we were seated almost immediately...within seconds our server was already at our table with waters and taking our cocktail orders! Her name was Janelle she was so awesome! We never waited for anything and I felt she knew what we needed before we even knew! Great job! Food was so good, we came back on Monday for more! Two bartenders during the day were epic! See y'all soon"}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food, perfect drinks... Will definitely be back. Our group had the chopped salad, rotisserie chicken, wings and fries and everyone was very pleased with their selections."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, honestly very good for Surprise.  BUT the reason for the 2.5/3 stars was due to the service being slow, the waiter inattentive and after a returned app due to it being uncooked in the middle (the center of the pretzels were still frozen) it was not removed from the bill.  I was unimpressed with the customer service and disappointed in what could have been."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this place! Cool decor, the burgers were amazing, I got the fish tacos and they were AWESOME! My husband loved all the brew they had on tap. & their beer glasses are a really good price! We left with two of them too! We will definitely be frequenting this place. Can't wait to try the fish Po' Boy!"}
{"text":"State 48 is by far my favorite local joint. We eat here often and have never been disappointed by the delicious food and great service. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better beers.  Always making an effort to do events in the community and different thing ms at the restaurant.  I look for ward to coming here many times in the future.  Burgers are always good and I really like the beet salad."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with our visit here. The Beer was not good at all. Unless the server brought the wrong one,  the red tasted more nutty and chocolate like a brown lager should taste. That was the least of our disappointments though. The fries - atrocious!!!  Greasy, soggy and no taste whatsoever. The the carnitas torta was tasteless. Basically cooked pork with no seasoning or sauce. The caprese sandwich (I think it was called?) was some kind of spicy pesto thing that was gross. The decor was funky and fun but please fire the cook, revamp the brewing process (I tried two IPAs and they were not great) and start again. We drove a long way just to try the Brussels sprouts and those were discontinued.   We will not be back."}
{"text":"Friendly service, huge bar and food menu. Wife ordered a pizza and loved it. I got the fried fish sandwich and it was tender and tasty. Fries were good, too. They make the ranch in house and it's pretty good."}
{"text":"My family and I went to eat at this restaurant last night and I just have to say it was totally disgusting. Our french fries were completely ice cold or burgers were greasy and cold we got the beer cheese burgers and the beer cheese was spicy had Jalapenos in it. It tasted exactly like can queso cheese. 4 out of the 5 people that ate with us got violently ill. It took 40 minutes for food to come out. We will never be back and I wouldn't waste your money going here."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always friendly, great food and some of the best beer in the west valley. Just wish the prices were a little lower and I'd come more often."}
{"text":"Been here dozens of times.  Never a bad experience...great food, beer, staff, atmosphere, the whole package.  Thankful to have this place in the hometown."}
{"text":"First time at State 48 Amy was awesome!  Very knowledgeable about the different beers and helped us pick perfect choices   We tried two very unique burgers and throughly enjoyed both!   Atmosphere is fun and friendly  Just ask Amy about the history and she will gladly tell you !   Local family owned business   We will be back !"}
{"text":"great place to stop for a bite and a beer before a game.  the hostess and waitress were both very sweet and got our order in quickly - and mostly correct ! Will absolutely return the next time I'm in Arizona for spring training baseball."}
{"text":"This brewery have the best corn chowder I ever had in my life.The beer tender was entertaining, she even offer me a slice of fresh bread with my soup.She really take good care of the customers.They lots of variety of beer and had full menu. I forgot my sunglasses and she look for us in the parking to give my sunglasses even it was so hot.Thank you Tora for your great customer service."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fantastic selection of both theirs and other local brews. Also, had an amazing PB&J Burger!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent waited only 15 minutes on Saturday evening! This was our first time here service was wonderful and very nice  Explains the brews and menu The 48 burger was yummy the kettle chips wonderful. The ceviche appetizer was big enough for the 4 of us to share and it was very good  We will Be back The lost Dutchman brew was really good  And so was the house champagne"}
{"text":"First time visitor.  Food was great,  great selection of beer, price very competitive.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place! If your tired of the chain food restaurant joints and just want some good food and onsite brewed beer and support this locally owned business head on over!"}
{"text":"Have them 4 stars and will be back again. Wish there was the pastrami burger as the chef choice. Could have given them a 5 star but the wings wasn't tasty- came out cold"}
{"text":"Please see the photos for my review... I wasn't able to copy and paste the the first review I wrote, and human nature being what human nature is... my laziness is strong!"}
{"text":"Would have to agree with Joe C, the beer selections were delicious and the ambience/decor is fun and unusual.  But the food is truly just meh.    The pretzel appetizer was good, but for $8, should have had double the amount of pretzels, considering it comes with a vat of cheese.  Sadly, there were just 4 little pretzel logs on the plate.  My husband said his pork schnitzel sandwich was dry and lacked flavor.  I ordered the brisket sandwich.  While you can take the girl out of Texas, you most definitely cannot take any expectations for decent brisket out of Texas.  The meat was hardly brisket, more like overly fatty chunks of flavorless pot roast served on an equally flavorless bun.  I've enjoyed more flavorful \"brisket\" at a chain.  The most atrocious item was the kid's meal.  The cheeseburger was burned to a crisp.  Sadly, the fries were also burnt.  My poor son would pick up one, say \"No, Momma\" and place it on my plate.  Luckily, our waitress brought him some orange sections and he enjoyed the grape tomatoes that came on my salad.  One star for the interesting art and decor and one star for the kind waitress.  Maybe we'd give it one more try to see if the kitchen was just having an off day, or for an afternoon on their cool patio with some friends."}
{"text":"Lost our business permanently. We just had a horrible experience at State 48. We had eaten there previously and the food was good so we decided to go back tonight for dinner with a party of 7. Told it was a 30 minute wait but it ended up being an hour and then after all the wait, we were seated outside. We didn't dwell on that.   Our appetizers came out in a timely manner and all were good. Ten minutes later ONE entree came out. And that's when things stared to go wrong. Our one entree (a pizza) sat on the table, outside, for 40 minutes, untouched and getting cold because it's rude to eat when no one else has their food. We waited, and waited, and waited and complained, and waited. We were there for over an hour and even a simple kid's meal was never brought out.   Finally some, not all, of the rest of the meal came out, but it was sub-par. Meatloaf was cold. Cheesesteak had NO cheese. NO CHEESE for a cheesesteak!! And it was meat on a mushy bun. Kid's mac and cheese pasta wasn't even cooked through and was hard. Our son didn't get his entree until about ten minutes after the rest of us and of course, when it finally showed, it too was cold. Meanwhile the cold pizza we complained about that sat on the table for 40 minutes was replaced by a flavorless substitute.   We asked to speak to a manager. We understand that sometimes restaurants have off nights and sometimes things happen, but our entire experience just fell apart and we thought we should let someone know. The manager said she'd take care of it and after sending back most of the food on our table we got the bill. Keep in mind that the manager acknowledged all of these pitfalls. The bill, however, didn't. We were comped $27. $27!! That's is. They even had the audacity to still charge us for the cold pizza! They charged us for food we didn't eat. Cold, horrible food. Almost $100 for crap.   We complained to the manager that it's unacceptable to still have the nerve to charge that amount of money for all their mistakes and not even consuming a full meal. She told us, \"there's only so much I can do\". It's like paying for a hotel room you cancelled, or clothing you bought and returned. It's not even the money, it's the principal. We were gracious enough to leave a suitable tip to the waitress because it wasn't her fault, but this place has lost our business. This is a very unprofessional way to treat customers, especially in the restaurant business that relies on patrons word of mouth and reviews. Shame on you State 48. Bottom line, if you want to frequent a business that stands behind their product and appreciates their customer's money, don't go here."}
{"text":"After hearing some positive buzz, we ate here for the first time and really enjoyed it! Really cool atmosphere, great service, awesome food and of course, tons of craft beer options. But the menu is a big step up from your typical brewery/bar food. Think more modern and unique. Example: the diavolo pizza is sweet and spicy with soppressata and a honey drizzle. Some of the small plates include brussel sprouts, avocado stuffed ceviche, cauliflower wings, and Mexican street corn. They honestly have a little something for everyone. We wanted the ceviche, but it's so popular, they had already ran out for the night (busy Friday around 8:30pm). Our server was great and made some other recommendations. We went with the pretzels and beer cheese to start and it definitely hit the spot. The pretzels came out hot and slightly crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. For dinner, my husband got the fish & chips and I had the beet salad (2 kinds of beets, goat cheese, arugula, tangerines and pistachios). We loved both meals! The fish was perfectly beer-battered and call me crazy, but even the tarter sauce was amazing! The salad was a delicious mix of flavors and the server mentioned it was extremely popular. They even serve it on the menu at the owners' other restaurant, Angela's. We can't wait to come back and try some of the other dishes on the menu. And next time we'll leave room for the s'mores dessert!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Great food! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead 5 was it took way to long to get beers. We will be back."}
{"text":"Food and beer was good.  My problem was with the nonchalant attitude of the staff.  Waited forever for our drink order to be taken, waited forever for our food order to be taken.  Once the food was out I had a question about the way my salad looked.  Waited fifteen minutes to see our waitress to ask her but she never came to check on us or she never visited another table.  I had to ask the manager about my salad.  It was our first visit and it was 4:30pm on a Thursday.  They were not busy."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place!! We love Ground Control in Litchfield and we were so excited that a new pub-style place was opening in Surprise. Unfortunately this didn't live up to the hype.   We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table (even though we saw open tables) and then were seated in the noisy bar in a very strange table. We asked to be moved and you'd think we asked to move to the moon. They put us near the pizza area, the only people seated there (which was weird). We ordered beer, pretzels and cheese, and a burger to share. The \"beer cheese\" was really bad. It tasted like it came from a jar...they need to try the Mellow Mushroom beer cheese!! The burger was small and bland, fries were greasy. With two beers and the small burger, it was over $60!! What a waste. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Me and a girlfriend tried this place out last night and loved it. The food was amazing. A lot of flavors you wouldn't normally find together but it was all so good. Finally a cool and trendy spot in the West valley!! This is exactly what surprise and the entire west side has been missing. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"We stopped at 3:10 on Friday and sat outside at the long  detatched high top east of the bar.   Three other people were eating at one end.  Three of the four tables behind us had 2 and 3 people at them also eating.  Two separate servers were waiting one them and went by us at least 10 times without any greeting or acknowledgment.   Decided at 3:27 we had been ignored long enough and left.  Heard the beer is pretty good but we'll never know.  Gave 1 star because we saved around $50.00 by not being waited on."}
{"text":"Very yummy food and drink menu !! Polite and friendly staff. The atmosphere is fun and energetic. I hope to see more businesses open like this on the Westside. You get thumbs up and 5 stars"}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience. David A was our server and he was very knowledgeable and friendly and their beer selection is unreal. Whatever you are in the mood for, they have. The food was really good. The meatloaf is moist and flavorful. We also had the Caprese Chicken sandwich was awesome and moist and full of flavor. I had the cheese steak and the beer cheese dip for it was soooooo good. They have homemade ranch and their sweet potato fries are amazing and cooked to perfection. I definitely recommend eating here!  David, our server, was friendly and since they weren't too busy on a weekday night, he talked to us and made the experience even that much better.  Just an all around great time and yummy food."}
{"text":"Took them forever to seat us. It was 2:30 in the afternoon on a Wednesday and not busy at all. We we're acknowledged after a little bit, but then just left hanging. Finally a manager came and asked us if we've been helped. The beer menu is flimsy, and lacks the option for their \"sampler\".  We had to ask and luckily they had one. However, they were out of at least 4 brews.  The food was alright.... expensive for just burgers. Had to ask for waters and other beverages though because they we're never brought (water) and we were never asked.  I've always wanted to try this place and I'm sorry that I took my brother from out of town/country here. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Service is not consistent. First time we went, service was acceptable and food was great. Second time was 7:30pm on a Thursday. We walked in and it took a full 2 minutes for the hostess to finish her conversation of gossip with a waitress before even acknowledging us. Then proceeds to tell my husband and I the wait is 35 minutes.   That kind of wait at 7:30 on a Thursday tells me they are not efficient. Not sure if I will return"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for almost 2 years! Tonight I had their gluten free pizza (dough imported from Italy) and it was very good. Best gluten free pizza I've had! The beet salad is always a winner! The service is friendly and prompt. Local first cider and house brew are great. Tonight we had all our kids and it was fun. Usually this is a date nigbt. Place for yummy food and beer."}
{"text":"The beer selection is great. The food was excellent. The staff was friendly but we sat with empty beer and soda glasses and the food was slow to come out"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on Saturday. It was a little hard to find because we turned into the parking lot before we passed the large sign that is out on Bell Rd but it's the building right next to Dutch Bros.  We arrived toward the end of the lunch hour but were seated right away. Their beer is not ready for serving yet but they had a large selection of other AZ beers on tap and even more in bottles. After a couple of samples I went with a coffee flavored beer. I wish I would have got the name but I forgot. It was really good and it was light which surprised me.  We shared the pretzel appetizer which was served with a whole grain mustard and a beer cheese fondue that was amazing. We also had the Carne Pizza which was a-ok. I want to come back and try one of the burgers or many other meal selections. We had excellent service and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"With my wife and a couple of friends, we finally were able to try out the new State 48 restaurant/brewery on Bell Road in Surprise for lunch yesterday. None of us were disappointed!   Alex, our server, was friendly and efficient. The ambience was dark and elegant while the seating was very comfortable. The food was absolutely delicious. The \"beer ketchup\" is a MUST TRY!  I've noticed that some people complain that the prices are on the high side. I agree except that, like most other things in life, you get what you pay for! We can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent beer.  Had the Sound of Freedom IPA and the Blood Orange Belgian.  Great food.  Had the beer cheese steak.  Good service from the waitresses.   However, only 4 of 5, because the restrooms were a mess.  To be fair, might have been due to World Cup week.  Brought it to the attention to one of the employees, who did get on it right away."}
{"text":"This place was great! The Buffalo Chip's were new and surprisingly delicious. I had the carne asada burger and it was amazing, the corn slaw on the side was good as well. Good beer selection, can't wait for their house beers to roll out."}
{"text":"First time eating here and everything we ordered was great.  Manager was friendly, staff showed a lot of hustle and our drinks never ran dry.  I'm not a lover of sports bars but I'll be back for the food and the good service."}
{"text":"This review will be short and to the point: Beer: healthy selection for choosing and good options Cocktails/Mixed drinks: OK selection but it is a brewery. Appetizers: pretty good- we ordered the wings, fried cauliflower, pretzel bites. Main course: not so good, between eight of us, we ordered the pizza, pasta, salmon, steak. The only person who didn't have any complaints was the pasta person. 2 members with pizza, 3 with steak, 2  with salmon. I was one who had pizza-the sauce did not taste right. The toppings-cheese, and meat did not have the right flavor. I was only able to chew down two pieces.  Great place to have drinks with appetizers."}
{"text":"Beer selection is good. Burger had no flavor. Ordered the peach and prociutto salad. Had 3 small pieces of prociutto and they were the un-edible fatty parts (couldn't chew it). Told the waitress who said the manager told her it was fat (duh!). Service was good.  Not worth the $60 bill. Too bad was hoping this place would be good."}
{"text":"My friend and I waited in the foyer for 7 minutes to be speak with someone to be seated. The host was nowhere to be found. Several waiters passed by and didn't even acknowledge us. We left. The place was understandably dead. If this is the service they display in the front of the house, who knows what's going on behind the scenes. Get it together."}
{"text":"There are some things to like about this place: the upscale comfort food menu is fun and their burgers are local, grass-fed beef (amazing).  The fried chicken was nice and crispy and the brussel sprouts are wonderfully roasted.  So why 3 stars? Well, our appetizer arrived after we finished out entrees-- and the waitress did not apologize. My fried chicken meal was weirdly sweet: the chicken was drizzled in honey, the northern cornbread was almost cake and topped with creamed corn (also sweet); and the corn coleslaw had a sweet dressing on it. One sweet item in a dish can be nice, but all three made for no contrast and an almost-dessert flavor.  I wanted to order desert, but I couldn't face it after the honey chicken. I'd go back for the burger, though."}
{"text":"The house-brewed beer is just ok, nothing special (I tasted 6 of them so perhaps the others were better). Guest taps good but over-priced. While State 48 attempts to offer relatively 'progressive' food for an otherwise regressive local restaurant 'community', the execution is mediocre/bad. The gluten-free pizza (a good idea for the local community) was under cooked, salmon on quinoa tasted like it had been pulled from out of the garbage and re-plated. A restaurant has a responsibility to serve even the least popular dish on its menu fresh and at its best. Parents liked the brisket but I found it to be over seasoned/sauced and re-heated tasting. 2 stars because: \"State 48 attempts to offer relatively 'progressive' food for the area\" but we deserve better."}
{"text":"We had great food and beer. We had Great service and a fun experience. We look forward to going back. Fun place to go with friends"}
{"text":"I was nervous about choosing this place based on the mixed reviews but they have now been open for about 3 months and I couldnt be happier. We started off with pretzel bite app with heaping side of beercheese sauce and mustard grains, Delicious! Next we had the beercheese steak sandwhich (which didnt look appealing at all) But I inhaled it like a BOSS,  and sweet potatoe fries, Delicious again. We also shared \"THE BOSS\" Pizza, except for a very little of the center of the dough not being cooked enough, Delicious as well, Buddy got a couple of Beers and Burger and Fries with more beer cheese sauce, Said it was Delicious! Looking forward to coming back many more times. Temp outside was an awesome 85 degrees and the outdoor bar patio showed it as it was at capacity. They have the \"Bar\" section with about 4 large screens and music jammin and they also have a quiter restaurant side with bunch of tvs and one massive screen and no music. The restaurant side also has some sort of bar and that is where they have there pizza oven as well. They have happy hour from like 3-6 and you get $2 off drafts I think and $2 off shareables (im guessing thats the apps) even though we shared everything. They also have beer ketchup which i tried with both the sweet potato fries and the regular fries and it was good but hands down either fry in the beercheese was the winner. The decor was totally cool and unique!"}
{"text":"Reading some of the reviews about this place I'm confused if they are talking about the same place. My wife and I have been going to other places in surprise and this has been by far our favorite. We've been here 3-4 times and each time we've tried something new off the menu and it has been beyond our expectations. The staff seem very helpful but see areas of improvement but for the most part all of them have been so nice and I'm sure as time passes will be great at serving surprise. We will definitely come back as this is our new date night location."}
{"text":"This used to be a good restaurant But it's just plain boring unless you drink a lot which then you won't know the difference the counter at the entrance is too high The parking is bad There always to be an alcoholic there"}
{"text":"Let me say \"we won't be back\". We had a four cheese pizza which was so dry you could hardly swallow it.  A veggie burger that tasted like falafel.  French fries that were VERY greasy.  4oz of Stout to the tune of $8.00.  Total bill... $42.00 ouch."}
{"text":"Wow...organic food, craft beers and great service and then Stacy says dogs are allowed on the patio but no smoking.  We love it so much...they will start calling \"Bill and Sandy\" just like \"Norm\" on cheers. See you here....."}
{"text":"Hamburger was ok but Fries were cold. I asked for a side of ranch to find out it has horseradish in it. .    Told the waitress she said \" well that is Ranch it is our home ranch\" with an attitude. I am just glad I didn't put it on my hamburger . Second bad experience same waitress same table. I'm seeing a theme.  Poor service mediocre food high price . Save your money go someplace else.   I won't be back!!"}
{"text":"Gotta give it 3 stars because we'll probably come back and give it another shot. First time wasn't horrible but not great either.   My daughter and I came in on a Sunday. She got chicken fingers which she didn't like. I tried it and the chicken fingers were breaded different than normal chicken fingers and they just weren't very good.   I had the hangover burger and asked for it to be cooked with pink. However, there's a difference between asking for it being \"cooked\" with some pink in the middle and having it \"raw\" in the middle. It just wasn't very good. I heard the \"brunch\" thing is fairly new so there's always some tweaks here and there when trying something new.   Our server was friendly but our finished plates were never cleared. I actually completed the bill with our dishes still on the table.   My wife stopped by with a friend one night for appetizers and liked it so I'll give it another shot. This restaurant is in a great location in Surprise and the snowbirds are coming so there's a great opportunity for this place to make a good name for itself! Don't waste it!"}
{"text":"The portions were very small and the menu was extremely expensive (the food was very good, though). The service was good, but not enough to justify the pricing. For a brewery, we found beers lacking and ended up getting a San Tan beer instead. I was excited about having a brewery in Surprise, but this one highly disappointed. If you don't mind overpaying for food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Dined 6/25/16. This restaurant is NOT ready for busy nights yet. Solid menu ideas, great atmosphere, good service, generally great-tasting food. Needs to work on overall execution.  Highlights of my experience: - Out of beer cheese in house on a Saturday night... at 5pm. Entire table chose not to order apps and 2 out of 4 had to change their entree decision because of this.   - Menu pricing, I felt, needs work. My burger was half as big compared to my girlfriend's fish po'boy sandwich which was 3 dollars less. Another at my table ordered the $14 curry which was a mediocre-sized bowl of soupy and lukewarm curry. No accompaniments such as bread were included with the curry soup. Fried chicken dish was amazing, great plating, flavor, and portion size!  - Some items came to the table barely lukewarm. Biggest concern was the curry since it should have been boiled if reheated or hot-held at 145 degrees from a safety standpoint.  - Service was excellent, very attentive despite being very busy!  - Nice atmosphere featuring some local art  - Food was overall very tasty  - The restaurant was out of most desserts. My table was told the only dessert in house was the cheesecake. 4 potential dessert orders turned into 0.   I'd say this place is a much-welcomed breath of fresh air for the dining scene in the area. Definitely worth a visit, but wait a week or two for management to work out the kinks of a grand opening."}
{"text":"Food was good, lots of beer options, and the place is big and open.    Will be worth a return visit on my next yearly trip to AZ."}
{"text":"The Good: Food! We ordered the pretzels with beer cheese and two pizza's. Food tasted great!  The Bad: Sad to say the service was lacking. Once we were seated we waited at least 10 min before our server took our drink order. We had a couple of questions that just seemed to confuse the server. Beers and pretzels with beer cheese were ordered. Server came back to take our order and said our dinner would be out before the appetizers. Confused since she hadn't even put our dinner order in yet.  We were a little confused on the pricing of the pizza's. If you create your own and want to add a few toppings it comes out to quite a bit more money then if you pick one of their pizza's and change the toppings to what you want so that's what we did to save some money.  Pretzels did come out before our pizza's so that was a plus but there was no mustard on the plate. The response was \"Oh did you want that?\" I guess not. My husband then noticed a dead fly in his beer. Super grossed out we decided to ask for a manger. She replaced his beer and said sorry. I was kind of surprised to see that we still had to pay for the beer. He never did drink all of the new one he was super grossed out.  I'm sure we'll be back to try the food again but will probably give it some time for the service to improve."}
{"text":"Very good layout for sports watchers a little high priced for what you get. Great selection of beer but as far as food they would better off using one thick patty than the two dry ones we got. The burgers were all we had so I have no comment on the other food. We will go back and give it another try!"}
{"text":"We have lived in the Surprise area for a few months now and State 48 has already become a serious habit.   Go early to avoid long wait times but the wait is worth it.   If you like beer, especially small-batch local, craft beer this is the place. You can do flights for $2 per sample. The flights are a great way to get to know their beer menu. I LOVE their blood orange Belgium. The orange ginger saison is amazing too. I have seriously liked every variety that I've tried from dark to light. We like to stick to the stuff they brew right there but they also bring in other beers from all over the state.  The menu is great. I'm pretty stuck on their pizzas right now. They are big enough for two people to share if you are going to get an appetizer or dessert too. The burgers are amazing. (The only thing I haven't loved were their fish and chips but what idiot orders fish in a landlocked desert...)"}
{"text":"Food is usually decent.  I really want to love this place but it's just ok.  Of course their selection of beers is vast but if you don't drink beer they do have a full bar."}
{"text":"I love this place!! And crystal, the manager... wow. She is an absolute GEM of a person and as a manager.  I wish I could hire her!! We had great beer, played trivia, and ate delicious food! They have vegan options which is nice as well! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We visited here twice now.  Great looking place. Fun decor and the staff is friendly.  The food isn't that great.  The homemade chips that came with my burger wern't cooked to order.  They had been cooked up earlier and tasted like they were fried in old oil.  The veggies that came with our hummus looked like they had been soaking in water for a week.  This place could be great if they would change their food prep practices and work with fresh food.  The beer was good."}
{"text":"it was \"ok\".  my wife and i just recently moved into the area and wanted to try it out.  service was good. food was good.  just good overall.  nothing to do cartwheels over"}
{"text":"Well, it's my first time coming here..hubby took his daughter last time here, and they both liked it! So, since we don't wanna go out somewhere farther for dinner and plus it's raining..so we decided to come over here!  I'm the type that's not really into pizza, burgers or sandwich when it's  a dinner date..at first I disliked coming here, you know it's Valentine's day, and I wanna go somewhere \"romantic\" and \"intimate\" , and this place far from that..but because hubby had a long and tiring day, I just decided to go somewhere near..  So, he wanted me to try this place! And I love it! Their food is surprisingly fantastic! it's on higher level kind of taste than the typical sandwich, pizza, place--they have a bunch of things to choose from! We liked their appetizers too. There's nothing that we ordered that I disliked..everything was yummy! Our server is so nice and very attentive to our needs.  Keep it up guys! This is for sure a Valentine's day to remember. ^_^"}
{"text":"***UPDATE!!!**** This is my first review of this place. The staff is friendly and the beer selection, sufficient for a place that just opened but it needs to get better in a hurry (they had ran out of quite a few). I asked for a brown ale and I was given a Peoria Artisan Angus Boy to try. It was refreshing and not to heavy, a Scottish Brown, I would say. I had the Muffuletta sandwich and the bread was old; they tried warming it up in the kitchen to hide that but it didn't work. The meats were cold, almost as if they were taken out of the refrigerator and thrown in the sandwich. I told the bartender as I was leaving and he was appreciative of the feedback. It is the first week of this place being open so I gave them a 3 star review and my next visit (in a few weeks) will determine wether I will visit for a third time and more, or not.    9/20/16 Well I just downgraded my score from 3 stars to 1 after giving the place another two chances. The beer selection is less than adequate and the food has not improved. This last time I ordered the wings and they tasted boiled. They were under seasoned and the sauce was bland. I changed my meal to a burger and once again it was not up to par. The cooks here lack the basic seasoning skills. Salt, guys... Add some salt for starters.   Very disappointing. I predict this restaurant will not last beyond a year."}
{"text":"Stopped by because we saw that the patio had a good amount of people so we wanted to see what was causing the crowd. We we're visiting from California and wanted to try out some AZ brews.   Happy to report that we were satisfied with our choices the night we came in. We also ordered the brussels and bacon pizza. Definitely not your tradition pizza toppings but it was delicious. Only down fall is that the pizza is t offered until 4 pm. We learned the hard way. Planned to pick up some pizza on our way back to California and was told we had 2 more hours to go until we could order it.  We went with the brussels and mmmmm! They were delicious and cooked just the way we like it.   Just heard that they are opening up one new our future place in Mesa. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: Over the past year, they've continued their slow, and steady, downward spiral. It's still a decent restaurant but like many new establishments, they started strong and then lowered their quality to increase profits. They change their menu too often and can't seem to maintain the same standards. They have changed some suppliers and moved away from flagship items that were delicious but not profitable. They got carried away with their in-house brew; it has lost its character and appeal. We've been here about a dozen times and, unfortunately, we might be done now. It used to be really, really good but not it's just decent. There are now several better options in Surprise.   PREVIOUS REVIEW from early 2016: We went during their soft opening today and it was instantly the best restaurant and gastropub in the west valley. The State 48 Burger, with bacon-onion jam and sun-dried tomatoes, and Beer Cheese Cheesesteak were flawless.   The beer selection was impressive and well done; they'll start brewing their own in a month or so. The brewmaster has worked with Four Peaks and has supposedly won awards in Oregon.   The environment / ambiance was nice as well. We spoke to one of the owners for a while and the family seems to know what it's doing."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar never have had fried cauliflower before but I literally couldn't imagine anything better also the southwestern pasta was also excellent.  The staff was overly nice and attentive great beer selection deserves better reviews than what have been put out there."}
{"text":"Four of us for lunch yesterday.  Pretty busy for a Monday afternoon.  Food and beverages all excellent and our server, Nikki, was very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  This was our first visit, although the other couple had been here B-4 and recommended it over other possibilities.  We all enjoyed it and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Sampled the flight of beers! All good. Had a wood fired pizza that was very good. Also had the meat loaf dinner. Also very good. Fantastic service from our server Hailey. Glad to have such a nice place close to us. We can't wait to return to try more menu items and sample more well made craft beers!"}
{"text":"You like a long wait time to get seated and then to get a drink and to eat come here we started at 6:45pm and we are still waiting 8pm we should have gone to the other 10 restaurants within walking distance of this place, never again, over priced food, hipster     joint won't be coming again...plus side beers were amazing but I can go down the way for craft beers not wroth the frustration"}
