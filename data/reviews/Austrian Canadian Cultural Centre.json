{"text":"My husband and I booked our wedding reception at the Austrian Canadian Cultural Centre with no real regrets. 

PROS: We had quite a decoration vision, with unique flair and our wishes were truly heard. The staff went above and beyond in catering to our needs by agreeing that we set-up decorations in advance, come in to rehearse earlier that week, meet and plan out the floor plan and details when needed over a couple-month period of time. They also honoured diet restrictions as noted well ahead of time for a few of our guests. The hors-d'oeuvres, appetizers, dinner and dessert were delicious, warm, colourful, plus at a very affordable price. Our guests comments were overwhelmingly positive when it came to the food! Their in-person welcome is warm, always greeting us with cheer. They thought of all these important details on the day of, making our event one that guests will forever fondly remember. 

CONS: Only one main con. The ticket per alcoholic beverage and half ticket per soft drink option did not work. We set it up so that each guest got a couple drinks on us. When decorating the day before, we placed the tickets under each place setting. In the end our count did not add up to the venue's. In fact, we never got clarity on how many alcoholic beverages were ordered by our guests with tickets and how many soft drinks were ordered by our guests with half tickets. Weeks later we found over 40 unused tickets; one guest was reportedly collecting them ... He was 8 years old and thought it was a fun collection game!!! Yet, it was too late. By then we had already paid. Our advice: bring your own beverages, or opt for open bar for a time, or have guests buy their own drinks. In summary, feel confident about receiving good service, great food and a memorable event at the Austrian Canadian Cultural Centre. Just do not go for a ticket system for drinks, as you may not ever know how many drinks your guests truly ordered."}
{"text":"Immediately after dinner I phoned my Austrian parents and told them how upset I was with them for not bringing me here as a child. 

We had the Wiener Schnitzel, gemischter Salat & Bratkartoffeln as well as the Kalbsrahmschnitzel and both were absolutely amazing. I have has Schnitzel and Spätzle numerous times around the city and nothing compares I promise you. For desert we has the Apfelstrudel and Sacher Torte. I would come back and order the same dishes over and over. 

As we were there on a Thursday evening it was the Lounge that was open - the decor feels like I am back in the Alps, very true to style. This is the best Austrian food you will find outside of Europe. I will be back soon and often."}
{"text":"Comfort food to the extreme! Very reasonable prices. The decor makes me feel like I've stepped into an Austrian eatery. The staff is lovely and pleasant. The food is AMAZING... try the scalloped potatoes for sure! Parking is free and plentiful except tends to get busy at lunch hour.

We booked this place for our wedding reception in July 2010. Our needs were as follows, and they were met exceptionally well.

- Amazing European food
- Open bar allowance
- Good price
- \"Built in\" decor so we didn't have to spend a lot on decorating
- Free parking
- Big dance floor

Our ceremony was at a church earlier in the day so we did not require the hall for that part of our wedding, although I'm sure it can be done. The ladies are very open to suggestions.

We did not require a picturesque garden or \"nature\" setting, so if you are looking for an indoor/outdoor sort of wedding reception idea then this place is not for you; the Austrian Club has a grand view of Deerfoot Trail but nothing as far as a courtyard or garden goes.

Our wedding guests still talk about how fantastic the food was at our wedding; that was probably the most important thing for us to be able to offer to our wonderful guests!"}
{"text":"Always friendly with good service, as someone already said, truly a hidden gem.

My 2nd visit comprised trying the daily lunch special.

For $12.45 CAD, cream of mushroom soup (perfectly flavoured and heated), thick boneless pork chop with a pepper based zigeuner sauce, a bread based Tyrolean dumpling, and  fresh cooked vegetable medley.

I have posted a picture this meal and a portion of their menu. I can vouch that the chicken schnitzel is so so good.

So far, the portions are exactly the right size except I am always too full for dessert so my next trip will focus on dessert.

The location is a little non-descript and hard to find if you are not looking but there are friendly people in the centre who will direct you to the restaurant. If memory serves, it has limited hours and unannounced closings. But, if you venture for lunch, you should be golden.

Highly recommended for locals and tourists!"}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times for family events, the only reason they dont get 5 stars is cause something ALWAYS goes wrong with my food. No one elses, just mine. 
But the service is on point, they always treat my grandparents parents and me super well, and they have a beer called Wunderbeer (or something like that) and it is OFF THE CHAIN. Its so good I dont even know if \"off the chain\" is acceptable in most circles to describe a tasty beverage and I am still going to use it.

{"text":"ATTENTION CALGARY YELPERS: HIDDEN GEM ALERT

I discovered this place years ago when I used to work with a Vegetarian Austrian who raved about this place, despite having a severe allergy to meat, urged us to go here. And follow we did during the days when NETELLER thought it was as rich as Scrooge Mcduck and didn't give an F if we took 3 hour lunches.

I've been to other eastern European joints before so I had some idea of what and Austrian experience would be like with slight variations on dishes like shnitzle, spatzle, and cabbage rolls. I'd been to Jonas, Heidelberg Haus, and the tragically defunct New Berliner but the Austrian Club feels like it's in a league of its own.

Their menu isn't pretentious, just old fashioned Austrian cuisine. My tall and lanky co-worker bragged about his Austrian youth and later faced mockery as the rest of us dug into our cutlets. Austrians really loved their meats.

They also have a great collection of Austrian beers on tap, a small collection but great nonetheless. I always had this amazing wheat beer that paired really well with every dish. They also have an amazing dessert menu full of pastries and cakes. GET THEIR STRUDEL IT IS STUPENDOUS

Whats more  intense is their lounge. It's filled with various spoils of the hunt. A taxidermist and hunters dream, an activists vomit nightmare. The overall atmosphere of this place is rustic. Since it's an Austrian community center expect to see some Austrian old timers here up and ready for a friendly conversation. Having a beer and spatzle and conversation with men will make you feel like you've visited VALHALLA.

This place is in the business of making you fat and happy and merry.

{"text":"Went there for lunch today and really enjoyed the location and the food. Started with a liver dumpling soup, followed by some meatloaf topped with an egg and a side of potato salad. 
Surely wasn't hungry anymore at this point, but I just had to try the veal schnitzel with mushroom cream sauce and spätzle. Just what the doctor ordered!! Very awesome place and I regret not having come here many many years before today. I WILL be back at this location!!!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I went diverged from our usual Vietnamese fare to give the Austrian club a try. I heard good things about it before and all the rumors were true!

You can sit in the lounge or the dining room. The dining room has a lot of families and the lounge has an older crowd. The Austrian club does things kind of the old fashion way where they actually give you a multi course meal along with free bread basket. Like WHO DOES THAT THESE DAYS BESIDES OLIVE GARDEN?

My coworker ordered the bratwurst plate and I got roasted pork hock, which was the special for the day and only comes out twice a month. My entree also came with a hearty potato chowder.

My food was plated to the edges and it was all so delicious. I loved the pan fried scalloped potatoes; the meat was tender and juicy and you could even get some mustard on the side for dipping.

I saw some diners get a salad on the side when they ordered the schnitzel, so I might try that next time. 

In this day and age where prices are skyrocketing towards infinity, it's difficult to find a restaurant that gives you value for your money. The Austrian club does it brilliantly while not shying away from quality. The bill came just shy of $40 and it was totally worth it. 

I highly recommend you give this place a try. It's a great cultural experience and a place to fill your tummy with amazing food."}
{"text":"The Austrian man serving us in the Austrian Canadian Cultural Centre is the friendliest man I know! Well, besides me anyway. 

Forewarning, if you take offense to stuffed animal heads lining the wall, you may want to avoid the lounge. Chandeliers were made out of antlers. I have no idea if they were real or not, but it certainly set the tone for a carnivorous kind of space! 

If you're in the restaurant bit, you've got your choices of some vegetarian options, like a vegetarian quesadilla with ground tofu, cheese spatzle, vegetarian schnitzel and ravioli florentine. Or entrees include a variety of seafoods and steak and other meat dishes.

We, however, were in the lounge. The evening menu in the lounge is where it's at! Schnitzel, wurst, goulash, liver dumpling soup (if you don't like liver, you won't like the liver dumpling soup. Trust me). I opted for the Fiaker Goulash with Tyrolean dumpling for $13.95. Don't ask me exactly what was in it. I don't know. All I know is a plate filled with gravy, some kind of sausage and other meat all mixed in with a potato-y scoop on the side that I assume was the dumpling showed up in front of me. And it was delicious. Is it wrong that I licked my bowl?

You won't be hungry by the end, but you will want dessert! I promise you will. The sacher torte is good, but the Kaiserschmarrn (royal pancakes) are so where it's at. Imagine freshly made fluffy pancakes all crumbled up into a delicious hot mess with strawberry syrup to spread all over them. *drool*.

That's the lounge.

There's also a 300 seater banquet hall complete with dance floor in the same building. Really well kept (and no animal heads on the walls that I could see). It would make a great facility for just about any event!"}
{"text":"The restaurants here have my favourite \"lunch with the guys\" in Calgary.  Wienerschnitzel with spaetzle - mmmm!  Amazing homemade bratwurst on premises as well.  Amazing and fresh imported beer selection.  

For too long, the Austrian Canadian Club has been one of the best-kept lunch secrets in Calgary (even though it is filled to bursting every day for lunch), it is worth the commute from downtown!"}
