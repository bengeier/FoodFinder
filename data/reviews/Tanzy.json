{"text":"I get the sense this place is still very new and working things out. The host was very professional, perfectly dressed and helpful the entire time. From what I could tell, the wait staff was very good, but we sat in the bar area.   There were two bartenders and almost ever seat was filled at the bar - 20 people. I waited SO long for a drink. Finally my friend interrupted someone and they brought me a drink that didn't taste like it had tequila in it...just tasted like koolaid in a glass. We mention this to the host and he took it off our bill - THANKS! :) We ordered a little food. It was ok. The calamari was weird. It wasn't fried, which is fine, I've had calamari prepared different ways before. It was still weird. We couldn't finish it. The shape didn't look anything like squid normally looks - at all. The consistency was weird too. It was almost like that fake crap meat, but the calamari version of it.  The decor is amazing. The location is great. It looks like they are really making a great effort and hopefully they will do well. I'll go back in a few months and see how it's going!"}
{"text":"Seriously, they had the wrong menu up for Thanksgiving and our Server said he had to tell so many people that it was incorrect.  He asked if we were staying, so obviously not many others stuck around.  I just didn't like the options they had with the turkey.  The turkey was excellent, but our steak was not.  Charred on outside when we ordered medium.  The fingerling potatoes were like a side of potato wedges from KFC, in fact KFC are better!  We didn't eat them.  Our Waiter was hit or miss.  I will never eat here again, too many better options in same area for same price.  Terrible Thanksgiving, even the roll was cold and hard.  I would keep this place for drinks only."}
{"text":"Made reservations 2 weeks ago specifically for the table side burrata on Christmas Eve. After being seated and ordering, we were told they were not doing table side dishes even though the menu said they were. They didn't even seem to care. This place used to be special. Unfortunately we won't be returning."}
{"text":"As recent Arizona residents,and avid foodies, we decided to go here as our first dinner date and enjoyed our entire experience. We got the table side mozzarella and the guy was nice enough to let us try the different salts they have, the truffle salt with the mozzarella was just divine. My husband got the steak & I opted for a shrimp pasta and we were both extremely satisfied. Our server was awesome & the ambiance was great and I will definitely come back here, maybe even try out their happy hour next time ."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The table side mozz is unique...haven't seen that one... and be sure to get the truffle oil drizzle! Oh, my!! Hubby had the filet - well prepared and yummy. I had the grilled calmari...was ok...  The atmosphere was nice; dim lighting and energetic vibe made for a sexy feeling. Service was great! Will be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Visited Tanzy again last night, and they are really nailing the menu execution.  Loved the table-side mozzarella with basil pesto, roasted tomato slices, and toasted foccacia crustinis.    I ordered the Piccata-Style Monkfish, and enjoyed the combination of the capers, fresh lemon juice, white wine, and artichoke hearts.  My husband absolutely adored his Mediterranean Chicken - rigatoni, fresh chicken, asparagus, artichoke hearts, oven roasted tomatoes, fresh oregano, sauteed spinach, feta cheese, and pine nuts in a butter sauce.  (I think I liked his a little more than mine!)    Also as a menu designer and a frequent restaurant diner, I appreciate the evolution of the menu design from the opening menu.  The new menus better reflect Tanzy's high quality and creative menu offerings."}
{"text":"Tanzy has a feel of a lounge in a five star hotel overseas somewhere like Japan, Hong Kong or Dubai. It doesn't feel like you're in Scottsdale when you are there. Thank God for a nice escape! We always get there so late @10pm that all we could order was appetizers. Food quality rivals that of Ocean Club or Edie V's. Just don't like having to go up long steep escalator to get a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Had made Xmas eve reservations to go after movie at IPIC theatre. The movie ticket included a free starter, one per table with purchase of entree. Originally 6 for  dinner, ended being 4. Restaurant was quite empty upon arrival at 6:30. Took them 10 minutes to seat us and we asked for booth, which there was about a dozen available. Sat down and looked at menu to order starters and dinner. Showed our wait staff the ticket from movie and she let us know we couldn't use both. We asked if she could ask management as we were each go into order an entree. She came back and said we couldn't even use one of them.  So unaccomadating even on a holiday and empty.  Don't waste your time, go to True Foods, which accomadated us immediately, was full of patrons and service was impeccable and food came out delicious."}
{"text":"I visited Tanzy recently on a double date before checking out a movie at iPic  Drinks: -Attentive/knowledgeable bartender -Wide variety of fresh ingredients -Great custom cocktails  Food: -High quality ingredients -Tremendous seafood  -Excellent sauces and sides  Recommendations: -Crispy brussel sprouts -Calamari: very large and very fresh -Short ribs: amazing quality beef, perfectly braised, side of goat cheese gnocchi was inventive and terrific -Sea bass: As someone who normally does not enjoy fish, it was incredibly tender and prepared in a sauce that added a lot, without overwhelming the fish  Long story short: I loved the food, the decor was incredible, and well executed cocktails were a great addition... GO HERE SOON"}
{"text":"What is happening to Tanzy?Had a mediocre not to  say bad dinner experience last night.Seems like there is a new chef or that the attention to detail , food preparation and quality have gone down.Been there about 7 times so far and in the beginning were impressed with the great food and atmosphere.Now is just the atmosphere-still a fabulous looking place.Had the calamari come out uncooked and only lukewarm  a couple of times,but thought that that can happen anywhere.Last night we were looking forward to the great polenta cake and we were so disappointed- it tasted unfinished and missing ingredients-no tarragon butter on top which we love-the whole dish was different than before.Our waitress(not very helpful) offered to help , came back saying the polenta was from a different batch-we understood that ,we were saying that the whole dish was tasting different-we thought you guys changed the recipe.The tile fish ,which again she did not know what it was when we asked,was blend ,slimy and undercooked .Rotisserie chicken pink by the bone.At the end,when she saw the polenta cakes untouched ,there was no offer of a different appetizer ,or taking them off the bill.Very disappointing experience and it seems that poor quality is consistent lately,not just a fluke!"}
{"text":"I love going to Tanzy because Brittany the cocktail server works there. She makes the experience so much fun! She is also very professional. The ambiance is inviting and the food is great! I highly recommend going to Tanzy.  With any luck you will have Brittany be your server!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The bartender Brandon was amazing!!!!! I definitely recommend this place. The shrimp and grits were awesome! Definitely the Hidden Gem of North Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Tanzy, I have one word...WOW.   OK , maybe more that one word but that one is definitely the sum of it.   I am basing my five stars not only for the hand crafted cocktails , atmosphere and mouth watering dishes but ESPECIALLY for the above and beyond service we receieved from Katherine during our visit. She had an abundance of reccomendations that time and again proved to be top notch. She was attentive without being overbearing and truly made us feel like we were not \"just another customer\" but a very important guest. The warm inviting service is what compelled me to take the time to write a review (besides wanting to share this hidden gem with others :).  We started off with the table side mozzarella which our server explained and eventually talked us in to trying. Boy were we glad! What a unique experience and a fun part of our date to pick our seasoning and accompaniments together. We paired it with a FANTASTIC suggested bottle of wine that I am regretting not writing the name down at this moment s my taste buds are already craving its soft tanic fruity notes followed by a peppery finish. What an absolutely amazing pairing. We also tried the carpaccio which I was a initially a little scared to try (raw meat :/) but it was surprisingly good. The calamari in a white wine butter sauce tossed with capers for a zesty finish was the highlight of the meal for me. We finished our meals off with a red velvet bread pudding which I found to be just what I needed to seal the deal but my fiance was less than thrilled about , only because his mothers bread pudding is and always will be the best he's ever had ;) ( who can compete with a mother's cooking??). Overall this experience was beyond memorable and I plan on returning for the inviting service and datesque experience tanzy has to offer. i will admit the menu IS a little pricey but in this case you really do get what you pay for !"}
{"text":"Been here a few times so the highlights:  I love the bar and the area in front of the bar.  Good selections of tequila, scotch, whiskey, and vodka.  Fire pit in the bar area with couches for hanging out.  Can accommodate a group of people or a a couple on a date.  And my favorite, the bartenders lean towards a stiffer pour.  Always a plus.  The brussel sprouts are simply great. Really.  Don't argue until you try them.  Very rich, though, so perfect for a group of more than two people, but a bit overwhelming otherwise.  The tuna tartar is great as well.  Both work as apps or as late nights snacks.  The entrees are good, but a bit pricey for what you get, which is my only complaint.  I  if I'm in Scottsdale Quarter I stop in here...at least a drink."}
{"text":"I hosted a private event work function at Tanzy, and it was exceptional. The food was top notch, and the service was spectacular. Christine was very flexible and responsive as an event manager, and her team did a fantastic job ensuring that our guests were well taken care of. Great environment, great food, and the prices were very reasonable and competitive for a nice private event. Thanks everyone at Tanzy!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there before going into the movie theater part of the place. It looks amazing, and upon sitting down we met the nicest wait staff I've dealt with in a long time. We ordered the mozzarella appetizer which is prepared table side, and while the guy performing it was a bit on the quieter side (there were a few things I haven't a clue what he said) it was the highlight of the meal. For our main course we ordered the short ribs, and I ordered a steak. The ribs were really overcooked and dry, while my steak was really under. I like my steak as long as it isn't well so it wasn't a deal breaker for me. My wife's on the other hand wasn't good. We noted it to our wonderful waitress and debated on if she should just get us a new one. (The waitress was on the side of us getting it, we were pressed for time and didn't want to eat an entree in the theater, and my wife was hungry enough to eat just about anything.) The waitress gave us dessert which was the Red Velvet Bread Pudding, but that wasn't good at all. It tasted of mostly cream and just didn't work. All in all, I'd say it's not a bad place, but with all the other options around that area I'd say just skip it."}
{"text":"Nice vibe, contemporary, very scottsdale ... what's more to say ...  A wonderful spot to hang out with friends and people watching.  Food and service is good but doesn't quite match up with the vibe ...   Happy Hours come with complimentary dips and cheese ... and  their grilled Calamari is really good as well."}
{"text":"So, I never take the time to write reviews... Good or bad... But my friends insisted I say something... I have been to iPic, and Tanzy dozens of times and absolutely love the atmosphere, the food, and the drinks. I used to be a server, so I am VERY understanding when it comes to service... Because I understand that sometimes we all have a bad day. Plain and simple. However I have had Michelle as my server that past two visits, and it is clear that she simply hates her job! She is brash at best, and generally seems annoyed to be our server. I let is pass last time, but after my last visit, I told a few friends my experience, and they urged me to write. Although the food was fantastic, and the drinks delicious, I cannot overlook that fact  that I paid $30+ for an entree served with a side of SASS! Doesn't she know that in this day and age it is a treat to go out and spend my hard earned money?! The last thing I need is to waste my money somewhere that doesn't value my patronage! I will be taking a break from Tanzy for a while and hope that when (and if) I decide to go back, that Michelle has found her true calling in life, because she is not meant to serve food."}
{"text":"Tried out Tanzy for the first time today and decided to grab lunch during the happy hour. When asking our waitress Jenna about the happy hour specials while ordering she said she wasn't sure what the signature drink specials were since they just rolled out the drink menu, but she said would ask the manager and be right back. 20 minutes later we asked again when recieving food, when she rudely cut us off and said she was still waiting on an answer. After that she ignored our table, which was hard to do in an empty resteraunt. The only time she approached the table was to give us the bill.  The Chicken Salad And Tuna WAS Delicious For lunch.  But the terrible service and ignoring our requests for an advertised happy hour left a bad taste in our mouths."}
{"text":"The staff was awesome! Great service, friendly and knowledgeable. The food was delicious! Stuffed salmon popovers did not disappoint me and was staff recommended. Definitely will be back with the whole family!"}
{"text":"Reviewing this place in context of a girls Friday happy hour. Ambience check. Service check. Vibe check. Enjoyed my time here. Can't say the food is wow but it more than makes up for it in all the above dimensions. The dips we tried were good. But more importantly it's a nice , feel good place surrounded by beautiful people. Go with good company to sit back and relax."}
{"text":"Good amount of food and wine options. The service can be slow if you don't have a movie to catch but last night our server was so great when he was delayed with our food."}
{"text":"After the comment I received after my review, I checked my inbox and indeed had a message regarding my visit. They asked for additional information about the visit and further contact info which I provided. I never heard any further feedback."}
{"text":"What can I say...? the Food was fantastic! The only thing keeping me from giving this place 5 stars is that the restaurant was a little loud and it was hard to hear my fiance talking at times, but sometimes there is nothing to be done about this.  We ordered the crispy prosciutto and blanched escarole buratta plate and it was amazing. We found a love for buratta while on vacation in sedona and we will never go back to a normal cheese plat again (at least not while buratta is an option!) . The cheese is hand-made in house and the accompaniments could not have been more perfect.  The boy went for the stuffed chicken breast and I chose the braised short rib. We knew immediately when our food came out I have made the better choice. He insists his chicken was great, but my short ribs definitely stole the show. The goat cheese gnocchi on the side was good until it got cold then it was rubbery, but  now I know to eat it faster.  Very extensive wine list, and fantastic service from the door to the table. We will definitely be coming back. Watch out though, cocktails are a bit pricey and the apps can be as much as some of the entrees...those $$$ can add up fast!"}
{"text":"Really interesting drinks that are unique with complex flavors (try the champagne-made sangria or any drink with jalapeno honey).  Calamari shaped like steak fries very tasty.  Red velvet bread pudding a must!  All that said, once I entered the bathroom I quickly became disappointed.  Not one but two female employees exited a stall (on two separate occasions, yes), warmly smiled, said hello, and returned to work.  They  FAILED TO WASH THEIR HANDS!   I've worked as a server and even if there is a special sink for employees (doubtful) or they didn't really use the facilities (suspect as well) the performance should still be played for the customers' sakes.  Unfortunately, I won't return and hope the manager gets the message.  I LIKED it but..."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant lounge in Scottsdale for date night or groups. Lovely ambiance and great customers revive. Had appetizers (tableside mozzarella & Parmesan cheese) and Drink was Illegalto (coconut, passion fruit, rum). The drink was refreshing and flavor was a mix of piña Colda & mojito blend. Delicious"}
{"text":"Dined here the other night with a couple of friends, and to be honest it wasn't my first choice. I hadn't been here for about six months, last time both the food and service lacked what I would expect at this level of dinning.    I must say they did a great job this time. Our server was outstanding!  Christian was his name, make sure to ask for him. Christian was was informative yet didn't interrupt us from having a great time.  The General Manager James stopped by the table several times throughout the night to check on our experience.   The food was just as amazing ,especially liked the fresh table side mozzarella. I'd go back just for that alone. We all raved about our choices of entree. I had the Scallop and my wife had the Chicken Piccata. Both were done to perfection. Our friends had the short ribs and the Sea-bass, both cooked perfectly as well.   If this is the experience of Tanzy now, then we will all defiantly be back and soon!"}
{"text":"The menu touts locally grown, organic ingredients, and Mediterranean-inspired fare -- so it was surprising to have plates of old, rubbery Mozzarella, followed by rubbery, tasteless (is this what happens when it's frozen??) sea bass, all accompanied by skimpy, non-colorful, not very fresh or tasty fruits and vegetables.  If the kitchen could stay true to the fabulous menu that Tanzy's concocted, this place would be a haven for healthy food eaters and might even give some competition to the neighboring True Food Kitchen. Just switching to fresh ingredients would make a HUGE difference here! And come on...no one wants to pay $30 for a previously frozen hunk of sea bass.  It looks like most people come here for the alcohol. So, if you're looking for a good bar, maybe this is the place. But if you're a Mediterranean cuisine/Organic  connoisseur, spare yourself the dissapointment of the food."}
{"text":"Sat down to eat at 7:30 didn't get our food till 9:30 and the food wasn't even that great"}
{"text":"The Four of us were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere when we arrived at Tanzy. A lot of places have crowds but no energy. This place has a buzz!            The appetizer of fried Brussel sprouts and calamari were both fantastic! Anyone who can make br. Sprouts taste like anything except br sprouts is a genius.  The calamari isn't your typical batter fried dish either. Sauteed  with some veggies  only raised our expectations for dinner.  My fish dish served on polenta was really good. The fillet equally good. We all agreed though that the braised beef dish was just ok. The beef itself was good but the  gnocci and spinach that accompanied the beef was bland, that's it.   The signature drinks were not memorable  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"First time (lunch) at Tanzy and I have some mixed feelings of this place, so here we go:  -Ambiance: Excellent! I love the modern and a bit of artsy decor, the inner side (looks like for private parties) overlook the McDowell mountains, the view is just amazing!  -Service: Great and attentive.   -Food, and the most important part: A-OK. Yes, that's what I think... after reading all the good things about this interesting 'Crispy Brussels Sprouts', we decided to give it a try, and honestly, we are not impressed... it's just average, with the side of sweet pepper relish just being taken out of the fridge, nah... for entrees, we had the Grilled Ahi Tuna and the Grilled Swordfish. (they actually don't have the Lemon Sole i was looking for, yeah, the online menu needs a update...). Both dishes do not have the 'wow' kind of presentation, which was a bit less than expected. I would expect a bit more for a place like this kind of decor and the location, well, maybe i'm wrong... anyways, both dishes were alright, I liked my swordfish, cooked well and a nice hint of the pesto, but was a bit over oily and dry... the grilled Ahi tuna was kinda bland, not a fan of the bed of white bean ragout....  -Price (for lunch): I'd say pretty good with the portion and the service and the location...  Overall 3 stars because the food did not impress us, but do think to come back for a dinner menu or happy hour... we shall see the next experience."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance here.... Loved the firepit when you walk in and the decor in a general.  Granted, it was pretty dead when we were there, but that's probably because I came with some coworkers around 6:30 on a Monday night.  Our server was great.  We were clearly ordering way too many apps, and when the time for main courses was approaching, several of us panicked and flagged her down to see if we could change our orders to something smaller.  She has actually *waited* to put the entree orders in and was completely flexible!  We were very grateful.  The food was good on the whole, with a few misses.  Here's what I can speak to:  Hits: Carpaccio Brussel sprouts - be warned, they are deep fried Mussels and focaccia bake  So-so: Table side mozzarella - great concept and presentation, but the mozz itself was only ok.  More rubbery than you would get other places that are making it fresh Polenta fries - generally fine (it's deep fried polenta, how bad could it be?) but the sauces could have been more plentiful and exciting  Misses: Tuna tartare.  Bummer, I love this dish, but it just wasn't good."}
{"text":"I frequently go to Scottsdale Quarter for shopping (love the Apple Store and Carol's Couture) and sometimes the iPic theatre...but I had never been to Tanzy until I was invited for a date with someone I met online.  The evening was fabulous...and not just the date!  They prepare mozzarella tableside...yum.  The wine cellar is excellent.  By the end of the evening we were no longer sitting across from each other...we were sharing the same side of the booth.  I loved this place... Great restaurant and great date!"}
{"text":"nicely decorated place but I wasn't too impressed with it. The food was good- average but overpriced. The hostess was unprofessional - she was flirting with some guy when we were right in front of her and someone else had to come help us. not worth a repeat visit with all the other places available so close to it."}
{"text":"We went for lunch.  Food was fantastic, ambiance very nice and the service great.  We had the calamari on the recommendation of the waiter and it was very nice.  Not fried and in an interesting sauce.  Excellent!  The pieces were long and thick so if you don't really like squid, you might not love it.  I had a almond crusted goat cheese salad which was very nice and the goat cheese warm.  My husband had a sandwich which was excellent and for desert we had a carmel pudding which was really, really good.  We will go back and soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered the \"brunch\" salmon and eggs benedict with my wife. The eggs in the eggs benedict were way overcooked. The yolks were hard and the meat was overcooked. For a brunch, the eggs benedict should be a signature dish. Salmon was good.  Service friendly and pleasant."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar with the new head bar tender Brandon. Fun guy and I am enjoying the best old fashioned I have ever had. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very accommodating and super pleasant waitstaff. Food has been great in the four times I have been here. Nice ambiance. Bar looks like it would be fun."}
{"text":"Atmosphere & Bar Review:  The atmosphere was beautiful and an immediate draw when we walked through the door.  My friend and I were in for a couple casual mid-afternoon drinks when we met Michelle, the bartender. She was inviting and engaging without being overwhelming as some chatty barkeeps can be. I told Michelle what my alcohol preferences were and she made two fabulous recommendations that I thoroughly enjoyed.   Great first experience and will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful! My boyfriend and myself wanted to go out and celebrate my recent promotion :) I found this restaurant based on the reviews and the price. I tell ya, it met my expectations! We were seated even without reservations, about 5:30pm on a Friday night, on a nice and quiet half of the restaurant. We decided to try the table side mozzarella platter with \"warm mozzarella served with basil pesto, roasted tomatoes and ciabatta crostinis\" as quoted from their menu. A gentleman actually brought a cart to our table and steam boiled the mozzarella, pulling it and working it. Even having us choose our own salt flavor out of six. We chose the dark wine and the garlic one. delicious! We both decided that was our favorite part of the meal. My boyfriend ordered the mediterranean chicken penne, liked it but thought there was too busy. A lot of mixed veggie types compared to the amount of pasta. He is a little particular so don't take his judgement too full heartedly. I thought it was yummy and a lil busy too. I ordered the shrimp scampi, delicous! He even thought so as well! Can't wait for the leftovers after I get off work tonight :) The wait staff was very tenative to our needs, my drink was never less then half full the entire hour of service. They asked our plans which created a movie discussion that continued a line of four different employees at different times during the meal. Very personable if you ask me! As I said, this place was wonderful and just the romantic setting me and my own needed :) Thanks for the wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow, factor that in if you are stopping for a quick drink before a movie.."}
{"text":"The ambiance at Tanzy is just perfect--elegant yet unpretentious--and their lounge is everything a lounge should be. But there are a couple of incongruities that limited the experience.  One of their specialties is a tableside housemade mozzarella platter. It's very reasonably priced for the pile of prosciutto you get, and delicious. But why the fuss? It's a simple bit of nosh. Even the chef preparing the mozzarella could not come up with a good reason why he was making it in front of us other than it's a show. The service as a whole was a little inexperienced and informal.  I had the pan-seared duck; fatty and cooked perfectly. It was served with a great spiced candied fig and a less impressive risotto cake. The greens were fresh and bitter, very enjoyable with the pomegranate reduction.  Their cocktail menu is well executed, and even the custom cocktail I ordered came out perfectly.  Go when the weather is nice enough to open the windows, ask for a seat with a view of the plaza, skip the tableside cheese service, and you may have a perfect evening."}
{"text":"Dinner?  Get the short ribs.  Lunch?  Get the burger.  They have free food during happy hour!  Try their signature citrus martini.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now only at lunch time. Love the open windows and decor. Food was great, had the chicken salad sandwich with caesar salad. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food - unique, delicious and memorable Service - like no other. JILL was amazing!   Table side mozzarella is a must!!! CJ was so so great with his presentation of it. Try the truffle sea salt on the side...yum! The scallops were cooked beautifully and were rich and full of amazing flavor. And the red velvet bread pudding was to die for. Jill went out of her way to be sure we were happy with everything. She was a huge contributor to our incredible experience!"}
{"text":"Ambience is great for a couple of drinks.  Have yet to try any food dishes but their drink menu is clever and refreshing.  The Tanzy Mule is great!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Sit at the bar and hang out with our favorite bar manager Chad!  Absolutely the best service you will get in AZ, oh and the food is freggin amazing too!"}
{"text":"Love coming to this place! Everything from the lighting to the hand pulled mozzarella is awesome. Definitely a gem in the desert. They also have a great wine selection to pair with whatever great dish you decide on. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Tanzy yesterday evening.  Though we dined at the bar and continued to order drinks from the bartender whose well was closest to our seats, all of the bartenders and wait staff were friendly and quick to fill our waters, clear our dishes or offer another cocktail.  The food was delicious.  For an appetizer, we had the polenta cake which was warm, sumptuous, and delicious especially on such an uncharacteristically cold night.  The tomatoes were partially sun-dried and an absolute awesome compliment to the polenta and steamed spinach.   For dinner, my husband had the yummy beef short rib while I thoroughly enjoyed the black cod ratatouille.  While both were good, the black cod was amazing!  We finished off our meals with a slice of their chocolate cheesecake, which was to die for.  All in all, we loved the food, the ambiance, and the service. Thanks Tanzy for a lovely night out!"}
{"text":"Tanzy is a great place if you are doing a getting together with a few friends, celebrating a birthday, or special occasion.  The ambiance is superb, the food is pretty good, and the service is great!    I met my friends there on a Friday night and was lucky to be seated on one of those lofty \"L shaped\" sofas near the front of the restaurant.  A slick fireplace sits in the middle of this area which compliments the open air seating.    We shared the Charcuterie plate (more than enough to share), grilled Calamari (extra delish), risotto (ok), fries (very good), and the focaccia & olive tapenade (yum).  Love the wine with its generous pour and tastiness.  Topped off the evening with the bread pudding and chocolate desserts (ok).    The service was amazing and the staff, great.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Probably the lamest happy hour spot I've ever been to. We asked the bartender about that day's HA items (we were there on a Friday) and he listed 3 items - 2 specific foo-foo drinks(probably colored blue) and one appetizer. wow.   Nothing here like a happy hour menu or discounted well drinks.   So we got a vodka and soda - $13.  oooookay, I guess they're preying on the people who don't have enough sense to go to a theatre (Ipic) that's less than $20/head.   I was there for a meetup, which brought people there to have fun, etc. You'd think Tanzy would appreciate that, but they had their waitresses add 20% to everyone's bill - nice. It's not like we were sitting down creating a 'table from hell with 30 people\".  Luckily I was impatient enough to get our drinks at the bar, so this didn't affect me.  Everyone from the people at the door , the bartenders, and the waitresses were super nice, though.   The bathroom was pretty cool..  Oh and last but not least, I have to admit I absolutely hate the name , Tanzy. I just feel creepy as a hetero male saying \"hey, I'm going to Tanzy\".   Please note my utter hatred of the name didn't affect this review."}
{"text":"I love eating here whether it's for lunch or dinner. This time I ordered lunch to pickup. The Turkey-Brie sandwich was full of flavor and absolutely delicious! I ordered a side salad to go along with it, and that's my only complaint. The \"side salad\" was only lettuce. At least it was the Spring Mix, but there was NOTHING on it. I know that side salads aren't filled with toppings, but at least add a couple of tomatoes and carrot slices."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Tanzy last Saturday.  I had the white fish (special) and my companion enjoyed a delicious pork chop.  But first we had the \"make at your table\" mozzarella; very fun and delicious!  I like this place as it is quieter than the ridiculously loud restaurants."}
{"text":"Tanzy's at the Scottsdale Quarter has some issues with scale and taste, from both a culinary and design perspective.  The designer of Tansy's took the concept of large scale a little too far.  The 18 foot high front door and cavernous ceilings were interesting, but when applied to the dining tables, things went awry. The tables were so wide it was difficult to have a conversation across the table.  And long...probably 8 feet, banquette seating, only accessible at one end, ...we had naugahyde burns on our thighs by the time we shimmied to our place settings. The menu bills the cuisine as Mediterranean inspired...not sure where that come from?  From the lunch menu, the Penne Salad looked familiar and tired, like the pasta salad my elderly aunt brings to every family pot luck. The mixed green salad was listed on the menu as containing \"baby mesclun (sic) greens\", apparently the Mediterranean name  for iceberg.  I ordered the Pan Seared Halibut with roasted tomatoes.   No tomatoes to be found on the plate, roasted or otherwise, and the halibut should have come shrink wrapped and labeled \"fish jerky\" ...just a tad over cooked. When the bus boy came to clear, he had to practically climb on the table to reach the dirty dishes and flat wear...we had to pass it all down assembly line style (see above mention of table size and configuration). The saving grace was the dessert we shared, a light airy puff pastry with caramelized pears, served warm, drizzled with dark chocolate and topped with slowly melting vanilla ice cream...S U blime! Next time, we'll just go for dessert and coffee and sit at the bar!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past two weeks with friends for lunch. For some reason, this restaurant was totally off my radar since it opened, and we've even been to iPic a few times as well, never even giving it a glance. Based on recommendations from a friend, I gave it a chance when my friend came to town from Sydney . . . and neither of us were disappointed.  First of all, the restaurant is visually stunning with a living room like area which is accompanied by a glass fireplace when you walk in. There are tables that line the exterior wall for a view of the happenings below in Scottsdale Quarter, or their are some huge comfy booths with marble table tops that line the inside and middle. Either way, the seating is comfortable.  Both times I dined there the place was virtually empty.  I am not sure if this is because there are less moviegoers during the week at lunch time or something else.  Service was friendly and attentive, although both times I had to ask for sweetener for my iced tea when they didn't bring it with the tea. Minor. Both times the server introduced him/herself, which I like since I hate saying \"excuse me\" to the air to get someone's attention.    The first meal was brunch that was offered on a Friday. Both of us were delighted as neither of us had breakfast that morning . . . eggs it was!  My Australian friend excitedly ordered the Eggs Sardou (for those who don't know what this is, like me, it's poached eggs, baby artichokes, crispy prosciutto and truffle hollandaise). It came as a brunch special with a side (hers was the brown sugar bacon) and a cocktail (the Boca mimosa). She was on Cloud 9! I ordered the omelet with spinach and gruyere; the eggs were cooked as I ordered - light and fluffy).  But I was really bowled over by the hash brown casserole that I ordered as an upcharge instead of the usual hash browns or breakfast potatoes that accompany the omelet. The cheesy crispy blend of the potatoes and the parmesan, gruyere, gouda and cheddar cheeses, as well as the crispy onion, were to die for.  I could have eaten an entire plate of these alone . . . yum, yum, yum!!!!  My second meal was a true lunch with a different friend. She had been there many times before and said that the salads were the way to go.  I could not make up my mind as all the choices sounded delicious. I was torn between the Pan-Seared Branzino salad and the Spinach and Strawberry salad (to which you can add your protien).  Since my friend ordered the Branzino, I opted for the Spinach and Strawberry with grilled chicken since she agreed to let me taste her Branzino. Both salads were fresh, plentiful and delicious. I have to say that the grilled chicken on my salad was some of the tastiest, moistest, grilled chicken I have had in a long time.  (I suspect it is the same grilled chicken that is used in the Chicken Chinois rolls on the iPic menu about which I have raved in an iPic review). The salad was perfectly and adequately dressed with the most delightful herb balsamic vinegar. Each spinach leaf was perfectly covered -- a rarity in most salads I have ordered, even at some of the finest restaurants.  My friend and I stayed long past our welcome in the restaurant . . . three hours had gone by, and yet our delightful server Jill offered us more tea and more water, or anything else we wanted each time she passed by our table.  Two fantastic experiences surely deserve more visits!!!  We'll try dinner next time!!!"}
{"text":"What a lovely evening! The service was fantastic as Charles was very attentive and knowledgeable of all the menu items ... and his recommendation of the enormous and decadent tiramisu was perfectly paired with a specialty kahlua/baileys desert martini! Definitely returning."}
{"text":"Despite its Nicely decorated corners that attracts you in with a great view and lightings, the service can be by far the worst i have seen in the Q complex. The servers would just ignore you and purposely delay serving you, as i observed from what happened to our party and two other tables. Never seen staff holding grudges or do as they please. What a shame for such a nice place..."}
{"text":"With it's Indoor/Outdoor atmosphere, very open spaces, large open bar, plenty of lounge spaces, Tanzy set itself apart from other restaurants.  Being part of the iPic Theater allows for the ultimate Dinner and  Movie, or Movie and a night out.  Excellent range in the menu offerings are sure to please more traditional Italian cravings, as well as those looking for something different. An absolute must have is the Mozzarella and Prosciutto table side service!!! Everything is excellent though. The Red Velvet cake is also a definite must have.  The atmosphere at Tanzy lends itself to hanging around a while.  Absolutely Love it."}
{"text":"The two star review reflects my disappointment after having such high hopes for Tanzy. I am having a hard time actually writing this because the experience hit me strangely in so many ways and I have a lot to discuss but I want to write something considerably shorter... So here it goes.  The decor is beautiful! The concept is neat! The crowd meticulous!  Now, the food...carpaccio that was so thin it melted on a room temperature fork. Zero salt minus the few fried capers and dried up convenience store Parmesan. And twice the weight of the beef was a pile of hand crushed, yes, hand crushed arugula, obviously wilted by the heat of someones gross mitts. Disgusting. Calamari steaks cut into French fry shapes and sauteed does not translate into the grilled calamari I had deceptively perceived after reading the menu. Each one of these were 14 and 12 dollars...Christ!  The more than one star review is due to the amazing cocktails we had. Whilst they each had something around 12 ingredients in them, as do all of there signatures, there was still a strikingly nice balance! Sign of a competent bartender. But my martini was 20 bucks, which I knew, and my girlfriend's cocktail was 14, for about 4 oz. But delicious none the less, and expect a wait for each one as the mixologist has to gather his mountain of mis en place for each drink.  Maybe the weirdest thing about Tanzy is that every time I have come here, at least to grab a drink before a movie, is that they let the kitchen staff just walk around the dining room and bar to watch tv or whatever. It's really funky to be shadowed by some greasy line cook who smells like sauteed, excuse me, grilled calamari while I'm trying to enjoy the smell of my 8 dollar supplement of mescal. And since the kitchen is opened up, you can have staring contests with the food runners, busboys, and line cooks as they watch you drink, eat or watch them.  Go to Grimaldi's if you're grabbing food and a /or a beverage before catching a flick next-door."}
{"text":"I have came here twice with my family and my girlfriend in the last  month and I couldn't be more happier with my experience! Food was excellent, drinks were tasty, service was top notch. Great for dates, family outing, and to people watch. If you change your mind IPic is right next door which makes it super convenient for everyone if you want to watch a movie. Also , Leah and Joanna (adorable hostesses) are super attentive and welcoming and fit perfectly for tanzy and our server Josh was awesome! Definitely coming back once I am back in town."}
{"text":"Great service, awesome food and took it all into the iPix Movie Theater next store. Would definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful! It starts by being greeted by Sonja and then drinks by Rachel or Dan. Chef Marco is awesome! Annie & I travel alot and this is one of the friendliest places with great people like Hunnika and the rest of the staff! The center cut steak is one of the best I have ever had, with mozzarella made right at your table! What a treat!"}
{"text":"Worst experience of our life. Waited at the bar for 15 minutes before the bartender even came over. Then ordered an appetizer and we walked out after nothing showed up after 45 minutes. We were very different sap pointed by the lack of service!"}
{"text":"Tanzy is a great option for a nice dinner, special occasion, or night out.  I've been there a few times for dinner, each time being a celebration.  I opted for Tanzy on my own birthday, when asked to choose a restaurant.  I haven't tried many of their cocktails, but the few I have tasted were top notch.  I hear they have a great happy hour.  I know they have a great wine list, and you can see their collection of bottles in one of the unique walls around the room.  As far as non-alcoholic beverages go, their iced tea is fruity but not too sweet, and pleases our resident tea-lover of the group.    For an appetizer, you can't go wrong with the table-side mozzarella.  A very knowledgeable cheese artist (not sure if that's an official title) comes by and entertains with cheesy skills, and the occasional cheesy joke.  The cheese itself, served with prosciutto and figs or pesto and tomatoes and adorned with one or two of your choice of gourmet salts, never disappoints.  Nobody has yet to order an entree that didn't \"wow\", but I have to say the short ribs are particularly popular.    Service is always excellent, and I think we talk about the decor with every visit.  Atmosphere and attitude top off this experience like the cherry in the Brownie Sundae (although the red velvet bread pudding is my personal fave).  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wow, what can you say about this place that has not been said. It is awesome in every area. There is so much going on here that I will just review for today the Restaurant of Tanzy itself. The beautiful setting is amazing. Plus free parking in the covered Garages. The staff is lovely and all the Managers really care about this place and your dining experience.  Which makes all the difference. We had a lovely table and the wine here is so nice, spectacular actually. The food is really good , The Braised Beef Short Rib is simply the best to me. I am not really a huge fan of Red meat either but, this is awesome.  The Gnocchi they serve with it is unreal.  Even though I know I am packing on the pounds I cannot stop eating it. Next time I think I will try the Muscovy Duck Breast and candied Fig.  It too looked wonderful.  The Risotto is very good as well , and my boyfriend had the Mediterranean Chicken Penne. There is something here for everyone's taste. Plus the chef will totally make something in your direction if you are a vegetarian.  A flour less Chocolate cake is my absolute to die for.  Second time I have had it, and I love it.  I could come in again just for that.  The restrooms are beautiful and clean. High end price but, good for a fancy night out.  Dress up, because, you just feel better when you do. HAPPY NEW YEAR!"}
{"text":"This place is a regular stop for me and my family. It doesn't matter if it is just for regular dinner or a special occasion. The food is simple, yet fast and elegant. The staff is knowledgable and always attentive. I recommend this place for anybody that loves good food and amazing service."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place but I think the best thing was the cosmopolitans! The scallops were just ok not great. Don't think the Brussels sprouts was a good combo. The waitress said they make their own pasta. Unfortunately it was so under cooked it was hard to even chew. In addition service was slow even though the place was not busy. Not impressed"}
{"text":"Just had a drink but did not really want to stay much longer. The martini was watery and the menu was not up to my expectations. Still, it's a cool place to hang out before seeing a movie."}
{"text":"Been to this place several times. Very cool atmosphere. Food overall is very good, and the  table side mozzarella is delicious and unique. Love trying all the creative salts with the cheese. Highly, highly recommend this appetizer (any version of it).  A couple months ago, we had a less than stellar experience and brought a complaint/suggestion to the manager. He was extremely gracious and prompt in his response, and his ideas for solutions. We went back tonight and had an awesome meal. Service was great, food was quite tasty, and overall an excellent dining experience. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Tanzy is in a real cool spot at the Q, right next to ipic, Salt, and Narcise. The look of this place is gorgeous, very modern and elegant, and feels like a lounge as well as a nice restaurant/bar.  The drinks are very delicious, and original. I'm not a huge fan of the food- overpriced salads and unsatisfying appetizers. They do have a Sunday  brunch that is worth checking out. Seems like they always have open seating, and they also have nice views."}
{"text":"Tanzy is quickly becoming my favorite place... The atmosphere is beautiful and classy without being stuffy.  The signature drinks are handmade and oh so good. I love the cucumber lime martini for a refreshing summer cocktail.  The food has impressed me every time. The first night I dined here they had a scallop appetizer on special and it was out of this world good! The scallops were cooked perfectly (which is not easily done) and had a beautiful salt crust on top. This item is not on the standard menu, but they do have a scallop entree that I hear is just as amazing. Another must order item is the hand pulled motz (mozzarella). You can choose to have it made in front of you or in the kitchen. Absolutely opt for the show at your table. They form the motz right there and you can choose the salts and oils to accompany it. It is damn good and fun to watch. The beef carpaccio  is ok. Standard but good.  Come here for lunch, happy hour, dinner or a sip before or after a movie at iPic.   I can't wait to try their brunch (bottomless mimosas included!)"}
{"text":"Food was very good.  We did the Mozzarella Platter.  They actually make the mozzarella at the table with the cheese curd. They add in flavored salts, balsamic vinegar, and oil if you want.  They made a special veggie plate for my wife and my steak was great!  Drinks were nice and strong as well."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  The food is great and they can open the large windows on beautiful days. Everything I have had there was excellent but my favorite is their Bolognese. So yummy. By the way, they also have a great bar"}
{"text":"Had lunch the chefs special short rib sandwich is delicious as was the prickly pear margarita."}
{"text":"Where to start...  The appetizers...fantastic. The salads...terrific. The entrees...outstanding. The deserts...amazing. The service...impeccable.  We had the pleasure of attending Tanzy's mock service for dinner a couple of days ago and were simply blown away. Everything, and I mean everything, was fantastic. It's really hard to choose favorites with everything so good but there were a few things that stood out just slightly over the rest.  Go for the house-made mozzarella and/or the grilled calamari for an appetizer followed by the goat cheese or Tanzy salad. Entree wise the scallops are fantastic as was the 12oz New York Strip. They were all out of the Beef Short Rib but everyone that had eaten it raved about it. For dessert, the Orange Burlee was amazing and judging by how fast it sold out, the Croissant  Bread Pudding has to be delicious.  They make a great Long Island Ice Tea and also a specialty drink called the Long Blonde Savvy. The Chocolate Martini is also a must try...it's like chilled European hot chocolate with just the right amount of alcohol mixed in.  Be advised...all this greatness does come with a price. Our mock tab came out to about $150 (inc. 20% tip) per couple which was a shared appetizer, shared salad, entree each, shared dessert and 2 bar drinks per person."}
{"text":"Great value for high quality food. You get 5-Star quality food for the price of a 4-star meal. Also a great place to bring a date for a pre-movie dinner. Absolutely love Tanzy!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, what an amazing restaurant! Food was  out of this world.  We started with the burricotta  and it was sooo good we wanted more. For dinner we Had the short ribs, sea bass, and a pasta dish called strozzapreti. All three were perfect!  Highly recommend everybody try Tanzy!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this restaurant. Unfortunately, they have some serious management issues they need to address.  1. We arrive on time for our reservation for two and we were told the computers were down. The restaurant wasn't busy, but we had to wait at least 15 minutes before being seated. Can't they seat people without the use of a computer?  2. Table-side mozzarella was awesome  (reason to earn 1 star )  3. My husband ordered  snapper.  Cooked on the outside,  raw on the inside (in other words, frozen). Solution : they take the same raw fish,  and cook it AGAIN. Now the outside of the fish is like rubber. They could have offered a new meal entirely, but didn't.  They did offer a dessert or salad, but his dinner was ruined so who wants that?   If they were smart about customer relations they would have offered a new meal or something to encourage us to return.  Sorry, but this place didn't live up to the hype, and is overrated!!"}
{"text":"Great location.  Nice variety of wine and cocktails.  Service is not friendly or helpful."}
{"text":"Really would love to do a 3.5 star thing here, but you know....  After a little shopping, my friend and I decided to check out Tanzy.  Neither one of us had been there before.  We climbed the escalator and were immediately wow'ed by the ambiance.  Gorgeous comfy sofas up front with small fires for lighting.  We approached the hostess and were seated in the dining room.  I'm pregnant and ready to throw down on appetizers, dinner, AND dessert.  The hostess supplied an appetizer and drink menu, and told us our waiter would bring us a dinner menu.  5 minutes later, someone came by with bread and water.  That's a good start.  10 minutes go by, still no waiter.  And I'm a starving pregnant woman.  I'm about to gnaw off my arm.  I tell my friend - \"Let's go.  I need to eat.\"  We walk out the door and we get the friendly, \"Have a great night.\"  Did the hostess not realize she just sat us 15 minutes ago?  I spin on my heel, and in full hormonal pregnant mode, I said quite curtly, \"We've been here for 15 minutes and nobody even came by to take a drink order.\"  Fortunately, Mark, I'm assuming the manager, asked us if he, himself, could take care of us.  I was fuming and debating.  We're here, might as well have an appetizer and a mocktail.  \"OK\".  We decided to be quick and stay for a drink and app and move along and opted for the comfy sofas up front.  A very nice waitress (and I forget her name - prego brain) came by with her smile and apologized for the mishap in the dining room.  Not her fault, but appreciated it.  She took our order and she got me a fabulous cosmo mocktail, and it was actually put in a martini glass.  Thank you for making a pregnant woman feel normal for a minute!  (Usually you get the ol' soda glass - what's the point in that?)  My friend got a martini as well.  We ordered the full mozzarrella platter prepared table side!  WOW.  Pick your salt, healthy amount of proscuitto, figs, olive tapenade, pesto, and fire roasted tomatoes.  Our waitress came by asking us if we wanted dinner.  We declined.  It was a lot of food on the app platter for 2.5 ladies.  Mark came by several times to check on us as well.  He asked if we would like dessert - we declined.  He said, \"Please, on me.It's pretty\"  Pretty?  Well, okay...  Why not?  Beautiful presentation of rosemary olive oil bread balls with vanilla bean icecream and sugar glaze.  Very rich, we couldn't even finish it, but so delicious.    The bill arrived, we were comped for everything but the drinks - 2 mocktails and a martini - $19.  I'm originally from the east coast, so this doesn't seem unreasonable to me for drinks and probably helps with limiting the clientele.  I'm good with that.  But I really couldn't believe how Mark and our very nice waitress TRICIA!  Yes....  Tricia...  how they went above and beyond to make up for our experience.  Both of us ladies take our clients out regularly for lunches, dinners, and happy hours to entertain.  I want to try this place again before I bring a customer here (who can help but be a bit gunshy), but I'm confident they have the right people in place to provide a positive experience and both of us will be back.  Again, thanks Mark & Tricia, for making it such a great evening for us.   Beautiful"}
{"text":"Very cool place, fantastic ambiance, hip and cool. Some really great hand crafted cocktails using freshly muddled ingredients and some excellent everclear/vodka infusions. One of the drink that had a habanero infused honey that is a must try if you like it hot!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. The table side  mozzarella is a awesome. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. I've wanted so badly to love this place. I will say mostly the food has been lovely.  It's the service. They just... don't... get... service.   Tonight, for example, I've had poor service in their lounge area before, but ... wow. The girl waitressing in the lounge area was horrible (ignoring us when we first sat down, snippy answers to our questions, constantly having to ask to order something, we did not feel welcome at all. She was busy but you can't be rude to people! My friend with us, who is nearly a sommelier in her training, politely asked to taste two wines before deciding on a bottle and was told \"she only got one more\" chance. And when my husband ordered a martini but had some terminology wrong, and then we asked her about it to check, she said with a laugh-- I'm not making this up-- \"whoever told you that was wrong... or must just be really, really stupid\". Speechless, we moved to the bar. The bartender at the bar seemed really on it, and at least was nice, and we got a round.   But here's the kicker... Then we wanted a table to have a proper dinner. We walked over to the host stand and asked about getting a table. She said it would be at least 50 minutes. We looked around the restaurant and saw 3/4 of the booths were empty, so we were confused. We asked again, and she said again there were no tables available until 7:15. (It was 6:25)  I then got on my OpenTable app on my phone and **within 10 seconds booked a table for 4 to be seated immediately.** And the app also showed many other times available for a party of 4... not only 6:30 but 6:45, 7pm, etc. We couldn't believe it.  So we walked over to the host stand again and said we had just made a reservation for four for right NOW... 6:30. She looked surprised. I then asked how that was possible she didn't \"know\" they had open tables. She said oh the systems don't talk to each other, blah blah - but we couldn't really get a straight answer. She just kept saying different things that didn't make sense. And no apology at all or sense of sympathy or anything. It was pretty defensive.  So they were going to make a party of 4 who had already spent $200+ WAIT 45 minutes to fill one of the empty tables in the restaurant. And were \"saving\" open tables for nonexistent customers booking via an app and who in theory may not even show up.   I don't know what's scarier... Whether she was going to make us wait on purpose, or if their systems are that messed up and the hosts aren't allowed to use their own judgement and say \"that doesn't make sense here -- let me help you get a table right away -- we'd love to have you, please hold on a minute\"  When we did sit down the food was *quite good* but took over an hour to get our basic entrees. The scallops were fantastic. My friends' steaks were OK. We had to ask for our table candles to be lit (it was well after sundown and very dark) and then they burnt out within two minutes so we asked for new ones. It was one thing after another. Drinks took a while each time as well.   I was thrilled they did offer us a free round of drinks due to the delay. And I will say our server Andre was wonderful and really tried, but...  This place just boggles the mind. It's a stunning environment, just gorgeous, and they have a fantastic wine list and good food. The location is a no-brainer -- you really have to screw up this deal. But time and time again, the service is simply catastrophic. We keep talking about what a goldmine this would be if they could simply get their act together. It doesn't even need to be stellar. Just acceptable. Just treat the people in your restaurant like they are actually humans and guests and fulfilling your pay checks. Be nice and happy and helpful and apologize when things go wrong. We don't expect perfection. We just want to know you care. We even want to just know you WANT us to be there. It will go a long way.  We have tried several times and are never, ever coming back. This was it. I'm sorry Tanzy. We wanted to love you."}
{"text":"Came here today (Sunday afternoon around 2 pm) and here is my review: 1:) The host is not suited or trained being a host. She came to us without greeting nor even look into our eye. She grabbed the menu and expected us to follow her. And we did. When we were seated, I asked her if she can get us some water. She responded with a long face: I will get ur waiter.(look I know it's not your job but you can at least respond to us with better attitude and simply let our waiter know). In the end our lovely waiter Samantha made it all up. Samantha was 180 degree contrast to the host. We were treated right and happy with Samantha. But first impression is important and the host ruined it! Tanzy needs to train their hosts to have with right attitude treating customers!   2:) The drinks: the non-alcoholic drinks did not taste good at all. We replaced them with regular sangria. However, they tasted diluted and nothing like we expected of a regular sangria. So the drinks were not so good.  3:) My seafood cob salad was great and my friend's pancake was delicious. Yes they use real maple syrup for the pancake not the cheap ones :-)"}
{"text":"Tanzy was my first stop for spring Restaurant Week. I started with the polenta fries, which were a generous portion, especially for one person. From there I went with the short ribs and gnocchi which were AMAZING; a generous portion and cooked perfectly. The red velvet bread pudding completed my meal and was fantastic.  Our server was friendly and accommodating to my friend's gluten intolerance, and prompt through out the meal. I would definitely go back when I want to treat myself at Scottsdale Quarter."}
{"text":"Had a great experience eating here.  A friend of mine actually got a voucher for a complimentary three course meal for two...so we went!  It's beautifully decorated, located in the Scottsdale Quarter which is absolutely stunning at night.  The ambience of the restaurant is great; quiet, trendy, classy.  They have a pretty good drink menu, though we each just opted for a couple of glasses of wine.  For our meal, we shared the calamari which was really good.  It was grilled and cooked well, served w various types of tomatoes, some capers, and nice sauce.  Delicious.  I ordered the grouper and he had the salmon.  Salmon was good, my grouper was cooked nicely though I wasn't a huge fan of the tomato based sauce served on my fish.  For dessert we shared the doughnuts and coffee which were a fun dessert; very rich but interesting and soooo delicious.  Would definitely recommend as a family dinner, a date, or just a nice place to do happy hour."}
{"text":"Located in scottsdale Quarter:  If your looking for a hip night out with hubby and friends this is the place to be.  Great tasting food, awesome drinks, Prices very doable. If you have not been your missing out!  This place is awarded Analynn's :)"}
{"text":"Well, I gotta say, pretty amazing! The decor of the restaurant is modern and chic, but very inviting. The views of the AZ mountains, really help set the mood. Service was fast and friendly, and definitely what I would expect of a restaurant of this caliber.  The food, was exceptional! We had the Tuna Tartare for appetizer, and I normally don't like to order tartare - but this was fabulous. I loved the spicy oil drizzle on the plate - I can't remember, but it might have been a truffle oil. And for dinner I had ordered the Crab Stuffed Shrimp and my friend ordered the Scallops and Mushrooms. Both were amazing and I would order again in a heartbeat.  Definitely a fan, definitely a must-try for those looking for something new and fun, and palette-pleasing. And yes, it's pricey, but worth it - make a date night out of it and catch a movie, it'll be a fun and classy night!"}
{"text":"Great place. Been twice while visiting for work. Loved the scallops and the fresh pulled  mozzarella with flavored salts is a must try. Has made my short list of places to visit while in town."}
{"text":"Decent place.... It's connected to the movie theater my family and I went to on Christmas ... We went in to grab a drink and I ended up asking for the calamari. It's not fried which I loved and it was sautéed in a white wine lemon caper sauce. It was a perfect bite for the fam to share! They were pretty quick considering it was Christmas! I would definitely be interested in coming back next time I'm in town for dinner!"}
{"text":"I went here as part of the Yelp Breakfast Club in August. It reminded me very much of a restaurant I went to once at one of the now gone building by the World Trade Center in New York and also the restaurant scene from Wolf of Wall Street with Leonardo DiCaprio and Matthew McConaughey.  Unfortunately, despite the New York feel, the food did not live up to the look of the place.   The selections seemed very bland and boring. I tried the eggs benedict and it was nothing special. Service was OK, but it didn't stand out in any meaningful way.  I suppose this would be a safe choice for a business meeting or a party, but if you're looking for a night out with interesting food, this is not the place for you. Nothing was bad, but nothing was all that great."}
{"text":"The ambience was great, so I was excited to be there. Service was ok, but all the waitstaff seemed very stretched thin and on their last nerve. I ordered the pork chop and requested medium-well. When I got it, it looked good, but was so tough, I couldn't cut it with a steak knife. I sent it back, which I usually do not do, but it was simply impossible to eat. The chef came out...I expected a simple apology and correction. Instead, he was rude, abrasive, and argued with me that the pork chop was cooked correctly. In the end, I told him to forget the whole thing and ended up leaving without dinner. Despite the whole debacle, management did not ever come to speak to us, which surprised me given the level of service you would expect from such an establishment. Definitely ruined our Valentine date.   We won't be back, which is too bad, considering all I wanted was a simple apology."}
{"text":"The fiocci was amazing.  Portion size could be a little larger.  The cheese sampler was just ok.  The crispy polenta was too thick and could be crispier.  The Parmesan fries were great!  Server was super nice."}
{"text":"This review is strictly of the happy hour at this restaurant.  My husband and I usually do a local happy hour during the week and have several  favorites both in Kierland Commons and Scottsdale Quarter, however, we recently tried Tanzy.  It turned out to be a mistake.    Happy hour seating is either at the bar or on several sofas.  We opted for the bar. There was no happy hour beverage or food menu.  The bartender mentioned one  red and white wine for five dollars.  As for the food, he pointed to three appetizers  on the regular menu and said that  they were eight dollars each.  I couldn't determine  if he just picked those three out of the blue and they changed nightly - very strange.   The three choices for the evening were grilled calamari, meatballs with bruschetta  or fried brussel  sprouts.  We opted for the first two and both were inedible and  lukewarm.  The meatballs were mostly filling.  The calamari was tough and no spices.   After a couple of bites we were done.   Service was sorely lacking also.  Win some,  lose some and we surely lost on this one."}
{"text":"Good food, cool atmosphere- dark and moody like any steakhouse, but had a clean modern feel to it. Friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"CARPACCIO!  EAT IT!  If raw beef doesn't freak you out, and maybe even if it does (Tanzy's may change your mind), try the carpaccio!  The fried capers and arugula compliment the carpaccio perfectly.  I am coming back again just because of this dish.  The calamari was good, but it is not your typical appetizer calamari.  It is calamari steak, cut in strips, lightly breaded and fried with a delicious white wine sauce and roasted tomatoes.  I was not in love just because I like the creepy, crispy tentacle part of squid.  Wow, did I just admit that?!  I guess what I mean is squid can be rubbery, so I personally am not a fan of the texture of the steak strips...But, if you don't like the creepy tentacles this is your kind of calamari because the sauce compliments it incredibly.    The service was outstanding; both of our bartenders did a great job.  I find the atmosphere of Tanzy quite romantic, but also lively too; would be great for a date!"}
{"text":"I always have a good time here. The staff is friendly and food is great.  If you have a chance, try the Fried Brussels sprouts, or Muscles or the prime rib."}
{"text":"Came here just for happy hour to meet a friend, so this review is not for dinner. Very disappointing. Their happy hour deal is free food (to go with the overpriced drinks), but when I got there at 5:30 the food table did not look too fresh, to say the least. So along with our overpriced drinks we ordered the cheese/olives/meat/grapes appetizer to share. I've had better and can't recall worse. It comes with 3 small pieces of bread - just in case you were thinking you might get a cracker. I'd recommend Switch's platter, but I would probably recommend a party tray from Albertson's over this. On the other hand, the place is beautiful, and in a great location. And the servers were very attentive. But for a Friday happy hour this place sure seemed quiet. Wonder why. (Note that some other reviews say that some menu items are good; it's a nice enough atmosphere that I wouldn't mind meeting up for a bite to try it out, but wouldn't go out of my way.)"}
{"text":"You have got to try the mozzarella tableside app! It is to die for!! Drinks in lounge by fire also very chill."}
{"text":"Just steps away from the escalators up, an open entry for an outdoor dining and an accommodating bar and dining area awaits a booth of four. The booths felt like a table for 8 or a table for 4 big guys! The adjoining wall  had a \"open view\" just enough to see the booth next to us of what they're eating and the hands moving across the table.   We began with a mini sampler of the prosciutto, cheese, and truffle oil on a crostini. It was so good that we went with the Parma sampler for about $30 with 3 meats of prosciutto, salami and Hot Coppa that had a kick to it. The rest of the platter came with goat cheese, fontina cheese and grana padana cheese, spiced figs, roasted red peppers, braised escarole, and rosemary mustard with more crostini. Already getting full I managed to finish the 5 of the 10 ounce filet mignon with fingerling potatoes and asparagus for about $30.  Medium rare is the way to go.  My water was never filled until I had asked for it at the very end and then I received an over abundance of water refills later. Better late than never I guess. Hehe.  The evenings dinner was delicious and filling but didn't have room for their bread pudding - which should be a yummy on my list! :p"}
{"text":"$6 for a Diet Coke. I don't care how nice of a restaurant you are that's borderline criminal."}
{"text":"The good: beautiful restaurant in a beautiful location. The bad: we sat in the bar lounge, but wait staff was MIA. I finally walked up to the hostess and asked if they have a waitress working in the bar lounge, because we were interested in ordering some drinks/food. The hostess brought us a menu and said 2 things. 1) here is our happy hour menu, and 2) I will find a waitress for you. The first problem with menu is that happy hour ended at 5pm. Actual time was 5:45pm.  The next problem was with the service. We were very unimpressed with the \"waitress\" who came to our table, as she was dressed in a tank top and jeans, and looked like she came from washing dishes or something. This is not what we expected from a server in a really nice upscale restaurant. The waitress did not come back to our table once she brought our drinks. 45 minutes after we received our drinks, another girl came walked over to inform us that she is our new waitress, and asked if we would like to order any food. She was more repulsive to look at than the first girl. She also was wearing jeans and a sleeveless shirt,sporting a tattoo on her arm from her shoulder all the way down to her wrist. My wife and I had no appetite after seeing this and felt uncomfortable being in Tanzy at this point. It ruined the experience for a night out in a classy restaurant. We said no thanks to her, and asked for our check.  Note: I commented to my wife that I would expect this place to be busy on a Saturday night. She said, now we know why it's not. The service is horrible. There are many other restaurants in the valley for us to choose from next time. Tanzy needs a new management team who understands and can teach great customer service. At the very least, the current manager can listen to what customers are posting here, and make the appropriate adjustments."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if possible and warn anyone in law enforcement to stay far away from this place. We used to eat there at least once every 6 weeks. Ate there March 12th and our waiter started friendly and all seemed fine. Another couple joined us 15-20 min later, and from there the service went downhill. Our friend is a police officer and was recounting a story and talking about general policy related things. There was nothing derogatory said and it was just a normal conversation. When our server brought our food he dropped it off at the table and said \"Here you go Chitlins.\" Never came back to refill the iced tea or ask us if we wanted another cocktail. When our bill came he refused to split it between the two couples (which takes one minute and is something they have always done before), which forced us to split it up ourselves. The drinks ordered were $11 on the menu and we were charged $13 for each one on the bill, it would have gone unnoticed if he would have just split our bill by couple. He was extremely rude and aggressive about it when we asked why it was more...to the point of asking our husbands to come over to him if we had a  problem.  We paid the full bill plus over 20% tip and left.  When we left we looked up the word \"Chitlins\", and discovered it meant pig. Management was called and told the situation..... and I would have assumed he would have been fired for calling us pigs. They only said he would be disciplined. He was in control of our food and we have no idea what he may have done to it while he had it. To be so disrespectful of police officers, and to have management allow that behavior is sickening."}
{"text":"We had a group of 3 and started with the grilled calamari. I was used to fried calamari, so when I saw the plate of grilled squid with capers come out I was a little questionable. It was the best calamari I have ever eaten! Delicious taste and I would recommend it to everyone. Their drinks are amazing and definitely not watered down.  My first drink was the Illegalito which had a Mojito taste, but a sweeter finish. Not overly sweet, but just enough to counter the mint. Raspberry and Rio was my second drink and it was a great blend of fresh berries and alcohol. I have the 10oz center cut filet of beef and it was fantastic. Perfectly cooked to order and the fingerling potatoes were a great compliment. My roommate got the crab stuffed shrimp and I sampled that. It was like having one of the best crab cakes I have ever eaten with a shrimp outside. My girlfriend got the Mediterranean chicken and that was also very good. Great blend of ingredients and she mentioned it was not overly filling as most pasta dishes can be. If you want a ton of food and are on a budget this is probably not the place for you, but if you want delicious food that is a perfect portion, an awesome variety of drinks, and don't mind paying slightly more to get it Tanzy is the place!"}
{"text":"DH and I went for dinner after watching a movie at the IPic and Tanzy did not disappoint!  Charles was our waiter, and he was very friendly and efficient but we didn't feel rushed.  I hate when the main course comes out 2 minutes after the starter, and Charles made sure our courses were timed appropriately.  We started out with the Parma Tasting, which was a huge board of meats, cheeses, breads and condiments.  Moved on to the Shrimp and Grits which was yummy as well.  We finished our dinner with the best chocolate dessert ever, the Torta Cioccolato!!!  Great food and service, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good steak for me and nice chicken dish for my lunch partner.  Good service and good food.  I'm surprised at the very low occupancy for lunch.  How can they stay in business?  Maybe it's busier at night.  Oh we'll, I certainly recommend this place for lunch."}
{"text":"I love this place. This is my new favorite breakfast place. The menu is so simple yet delicious. The service is always great. And it's connected to my favorite theater ipic. Can't go here and not get the quartet of mimosas for only $10!! Most places charge $8 for a mimosa, here you get 4 for $10! Can't beat that. Best place to come to unwind after a long work week. The portions of food are good for the price as well. I've also sat at the bar a few times for a cocktail and it's just as great. I love this place. The atmosphere is awesome and relaxing. The service is always great. One of my pet peeves about places lately is lack of service but tanzy doesn't have that problem. The servers are great. They make sure my glass is always full and checks in on me. iPic and tanzy have one me over for a long time. Good job!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, ambiance, menu. Not what you'd expect from an Italian restaurant where the check was over $100 without drinks. Menu was very limited and the quality of the food was poor at best."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was horrible.  After the waiter took our order, he never came back to check on us. We had to get up and ask for our drinks and we were the only people at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Service has always been good, a food is really tasty!  It's also usually quiet (bad for business, good for privacy/conversation).  Sad it closed for weekday lunch.  :("}
{"text":"My friend and I enjoyed a late lunch at Tanzy - the service was impeccable and the food delicious.  We enjoyed a turkey burger (moist & flavorful) and an ahi tuna  steak sandwhich of generous proportions.   We also benefited from the last day of the \"buy 1 entree/get 1 free\" promo which made this more affordable."}
{"text":"Tanzy is such an amazing place. My wife and I  went on my birthday. Koop was our waiter.  Koop was not only an amazing waiter but also very friendly and fun.  Im not normal a wine drink but the wine you carry was beyond awesome.  The food is beyond words! This is definitely the best birthday date night I've ever had.  We will definitely be returning and be bring friends to share the experience as well."}
{"text":"I eat here couple times a week by far my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. The food is amazing, the staff is great, and the bartender is a genius. You can easily do dinner and a movie here with iPix next door ."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party and had a private room in the back for a large party. Hostess stand immediately greeted us and showed us to the group. Waiters were very attentive and immediately asked if he could get us anything to drink. The waiters did not disappoint and were on top of refills and bringing more wine and answering any questions we had about the menu. Nice and pretty atmosphere too overlooking the area since the restaurant is upstairs. Food was delicious and portion size was perfect for the price. Table side mozzarella a must for large groups or special occasion and it is amazing.  We had a bill snafu with who paid for what (our fault mainly and a misunderstanding from us to the waiters), but the waiters were very patient while we figured it out and charged us accordingly once we figured out how to do math. Overall it was delicious and a great experience. Shoutout to the waiters in our private dining room for putting up with us."}
{"text":"Went back for the first time in months...noticed they changed the menu. Yayyyy!! Their previous menu was a big fat FAIL!! It was no wonder the dining room was always....let's just say...crickets!   This time, I only went for drinks and an appetizer. The revised, hand-crafted cocktail menu is super-slamming! And I'm SO glad they kept the tempura brussels sprouts on the menu!   I'm looking forward to trying the new dinner menu!! Who knows, Tanzy MAY get another star!"}
{"text":"Came here for a date night and ended up  having the Swordfish, a few of Tanzy's 11 (cocktails, all of them are great), and the brussel sprouts. All of which were very good.  The Brussel Sprouts comes with a very delicious salsa that disappears far too quickly.  My only regret is not getting desert. Definitely worth checking out and a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Wouldn't go again. Had a reservation for 715. Got seated at 8pm. Appetizer was greasy and scallops where rubbery. Didn't want to wait for dessert because we where there for 2.5 hours at this point for a meal that was just 'eh'. I expect more for a place that costs me $100+."}
{"text":"It was good but not that good..I don't mind paying more for a good meal but I just felt the prices were way to high for what I got. It was just really expensive and its right next to the movie theater and I just can't see myself eating there again. Especially when I can eat  and drink in the movie theater in big cushy seats next door :)"}
{"text":"The tableside mozzarella cheese is the reason I love this place.  The salmon is very good as well, but I probably wouldn't make the drive from central Phoenix if it were not for the awesome tableside cheese.  There is a pasta dish on the menu I've tried to order two different times...the first time they told me they were out (this was before Christmas) and the second time they told me their supplier stopped making the noodle (this was in mid February).  I wish they would remove it from the menu because I had my heart set on trying it.  As  I recall the menu was just an oversized sheet of paper.  You can tell they spared no expense with the décor, so spend the $1 and print some new menus so that your customers are not disappointed when ordering."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The bartenders are super friendly and will recommend drinks and even exchange them if you dont like it with no problem.  I love sitting in the lounge areas with the fire places.  Its so relaxing.  If you go for Happy hour - they have a small snacky buffet set up that sets the place up for even more drinks.  Don't go there expecting a drink for $8 - more like $12 or so - but they are so creative and the drinks are worth it.  And they even validate valet parking passes for the Scottsdale Quarter!  Love it!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere cannot be beat. It feels like a Gordon Ramsey type restaurant! The food was very good. They really execute on the details. The service was just ok  For the price, which I am not complaining about, I prefer my sevice with a little more personalty. Don't get me wrong they were fast and attentive just nothing extra. I will definitely try them again"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times on dates and gotten decent service. I came tonight with a girlfriend, we sat near the fire,  and it took forever to be greeted and get a drink order. I guess you either need to look \"Scottsdale\" or be with a man to get service.  Once we did get served Shannon the bartender was attentive."}
{"text":"Best lobster Benedict I've ever had. Went for Easter brunch and it was wonderful. Easter bunny even came over for photo ops LOL"}
{"text":"I was at the restaurant today for lunch. My friend and I ordered Tanzy salad ..and I got a heap of half dead arugula and some other stuff from a can at the bottom. No bread to accompany the salad. Ordered a caprisi and got two toasts not restaurant quality with a ball of mozerella and some grape tomatoes. The drink which was supposed to be pure beet + carrot juice was sparkling water with some juice in it. I will be calling in to get my money back I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at Tanzy.  The atmosphere is beautiful. It is romantic and modern. The service excellent. The dishes my husband and I  had were very good. I had the gulf shrimp and grits, he had the Chilean sea bass.  Excellent. Can't say enough about this hidden treasure!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to meet up with friends, a first date, or to grab a drink before the movie. BTW, you can take the drink with you into the theater. Very Asian inspired decor. One side of the restaurant is opened where guest can stand/walk around (lounge sitting). The other half of the restaurant is more quiet, reserved.    Service very slow at first. I sat at the bar and waited over 20 minutes for my drink order! And my mouth was dry too!  :-( I finally get my turn. The barista is very friendly and apologetic for the wait. I select a glass of Riesling and it came to me in no time.  For dinner, I opted for the tansy salad with chicken. (And the clock is ticking!)  16 minutes...yes!  And it's delicious! They're forgiven!  Oh, and the bathroom is pretty spacious, well designed with big mirrors... You know how we girls love 'checking' ourselves! ;-)"}
{"text":"Have gone to happy hour here several times and have to say that the bar staff and food are excellent.  The fresh mozzarella is made to order at your table and definitely wortwhile."}
{"text":"Every time I come back here I have hope for this place, but it keeps getting more and more underwhelming. This is such a waste of location. I understand the owner has more money than they know what to do with, but if you not going to do anything to make this place better, why don't you just close it already and let someone else take advantage of the location."}
{"text":"Went there last night for Mother's Day dinner around 545pm  It wasn't busy and we had a reservation.  Sat immediately, but after about 10 min...no one had been to our table.  not even with water or to say hi.  i got up and went to the manager up front and let him know...he was very nice and very apologetic.  Within seconds of my return there was a very friendly and bubbly female server at our table.  From there on our experience was amazing and delicious.  We had the warm mozz made at the table and ribeye, roasted chicken, and linguini.  They were all mouth-watering and perfect.  Dessert was the red velvet bread pudding and it was really good...just think it needs more cream cheese element.  Service was great and they even showed the apology for our initial experience buy taking off an app and round of drinks off the check...which was unexpected and a great final touch to the night.  Will for sure go back...want to try more of their cocktails and food...SOOOOOO GOOD!!"}
{"text":"We don't seem to exist here.  The service was horrible.  Sat at the bar right in front of the bartender who was too busy cleaning glasses to acknowledge us.  I'm usually rather patient about these types of things, as I know they have other tasks to accomplish, however, it was NOT busy at all and it wasn't like she didn't see us.  She just gave us the impression that she would get around to taking our order when she felt like it...which was certainly not any time soon.  It was awkwardly rude and strange behavior.  If I weren't new to the area (and my guest from out of town) I would have thought she was an old enemy from days gone by."}
{"text":"I've been to this place over five times now, none of them because I chose it.  The place is gorgeous, too bad the food is nothing to write about.  I always have a hard time deciding what to eat, since nothing I've had in the past is great, just ok.  I've had the calamari, the eggplant stack, a couple of their salads and the mozzarella plate, this one I had last thursday at my moms night out.  One of the servers comes with a big cart and pretty much massages your mozzarella into shape and plates it for you (he wears gloves).  I had two martinis and the cheese plate for $39, so I left a $50.  Not that the service was great, but I just tip well.  I had to ask her for water several times.  Again, the place, gorgeous, the rest, not so much for the price."}
{"text":"Went here with my date during August Bites.  Its a promotion the Scottsdale Quarter is doing this week to lure in patrons with discounts and deals at their restaurants.  This place offered a fixed three course menu similar to what you'd see during AZ Restaurant Week.  Choice of 1 of 3 appetizers, 1 of 4 entrees, and 1 of 2 desserts.  Good thing too because their prices are not cheap if you're coming here for a normal outing.  My date and I split the Parma for the appetizer.  Its prosciutto and pear on toasted bread with goat cheese.  Phenomenal flavor.  For the main entree I got the cedar plank salmon while she got the Quattro Formaggio.  The salmon was good and mixed well with the veggies and couscous, but didn't wow me.  Her pasta though, wow.  A bunch of different cheeses wrapped in pasta almost like a ravioli.  Bursting with flavor with that sage sauce and caramelized pears.  Highly recommend the Quattro Formaggio.  For dessert, all the Yelpers talked a big game about the Red Velvet Bread Pudding and we got it.  Be warned, do not try to eat this alone.  Its amazing, but so rich you have to split it.  Even splitting it we both felt way full.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere is pretty quintessential Scottsdale.  A mix of fine dining with a trendy vibe.  This place isn't too pretentious, though the size of the booth we were in was pretty over the top.  If the normal everyday prices were reasonable, I'd give this a perfect 5 star score.  But the salmon I ordered would normally have been $40 and the appetizer about $20.  Yeah, no thanks.  But for August Bites (and if they participate in AZ Restaurant Week), a fixed 3 course meal for $30-$40 person is a pretty solid bargain."}
{"text":"This is an enormous space that is well decorated but felt kind of lonely at lunch. There is a fix menu that asks you to buy a drink, sangria or Bloody Mary, with your lunch. Honestly, I didn't want a drink with my lunch, but went ahead because it was a fix price menu and we were already seated by the time we understood the parameters. I ordered an endive and arugula salad with goat cheese. The salad was quite tasty but they forgot to add a main ingredient, the goat cheese, so I had to wait to snag my waitress again. Overall, she was attentive and friendly. My husband ordered the Caesar Salad and the chicken was steaming hot but a rather lackluster dish for the price.  Our lunch was their minimum of $20.00 a person. If you're in the mood for booze at lunch, it's an okay deal but we felt it was overly pricey and not all that special other than sort of opulent surroundings that they may need to pay for some way!"}
{"text":"This is about the 5th  time we've eaten at Tanzy-- stopped after a movie at the IPic next door. Had a reservation through Open Table and had a call from the restaurant in the afternoon to check on table preference.  If you call to ask if I prefer a booth or table, and I say \"table\" then why am I seated in a booth?  Ignored that issue. Waiter not real sure of himself but admits that they are limited in \"mozzarella\" chefs tonight so our table side mozzarella will be slightly delayed. No problem.  Now starts the problems. Why is my salad not brought until all dinners are when I clearly said I would be sharing a dinner with a fellow diner?  Why did we have to wait almost 10 minutes after asking for more water for the pitcher to appear?  Why did our waiter wait over 20 minutes after our mozzarella course was done before coming to advise dinners would be slow due to low staff tonight?  I guess that's why the dining area was so empty (which begs the question why was food served so slow if only the bar area was busy?). Actually liked the steak and pasta ordered at the table but inexcusable service leads us to question our ever returning. Can't believe it took us 2 hours to complete a meal with 4 diners at this less than fine dining experience. Too bad."}
{"text":"This is how they salt their margarita.. (Pic attached) honestly WTF?! Ugly and non-functional. Also, why wouldn't you give me the happy hour menu if it's happy hour? Ugh."}
{"text":"We spent over $150 ,had reservations, but we initially got a really bad table. They had put a table outside the regular seating area. The wine glasses were dirty, the service was slow and my wife and were disappointed. Too expensive for what they deliver."}
{"text":"For valentines day we decided to come to tanzy after a movie. The place is decorated nicely and has a huge bar so it's great to eat your meal there. We had the tuna tar tar and the beef carpaccio was was delicious. It's not too pricy either so if you're looking for a great meal before running to Ipic, id say you can't go wrong with tanzy."}
{"text":"Snotsdale vibe aside, the place is pretty nicely decorated and the atmosphere is nice.  We came for restaurant week and our waitress was great.  She was not the least bit snotty!  For first course we tried the calamari and the crispy brussel sprouts.  The sprouts were basically deep fried with some kind of white sauce drizzled over it.  With the sweet-tangy salsa it was actually very good and the portion was huge.  The calamari was cooked perfectly but I didn't understand the combination.  It came with roasted tomato, capers and artichoke hearts.  Not bad, not as big of a portion size.  For the entrees we chose the short rib and pork chop.  The short rib was a large square rectangle which threw me off slightly, but the taste was pretty good.  Came with a very sweet balsamic reduction, blue cheese gnocci and wilted spinach.  The pork chop was cooked perfectly with a nice crust and soft middle.  The sauce was good, although it could have used more and bed of vegetables that included fingerling potatoes were great but also not as plentiful.  Just a little bit of green on the plate and it would've been just perfect.  All in all, I'm surprised the yelp rating on this restaurant is so low.  Must be mostly pricing or service because the food is pretty good.  A don't miss for Restaurant Week!"}
{"text":"If you could have a place that is visually stunning and the food presentation accompanies that beautiful art, Tanzy is hands down the spot. It's one of my fave go-to places for dinner, outings and client meet ups.   I recently had the cedar planked salmon and I wish I could come up with a good reason to critique it but I can't. The texture and flavors from this entree are simply an orchestra of delishness. It probably comes second place to my fave dish the pan-seared duck breast with candied figs. Turning down the red velvet bread pudding to complete your meal is turning down an entrance in heavenly food bliss. Try it and let me know your thoughts :)"}
{"text":"Recently ate at this gorgeous new Scottsdale Restaurant. Had a family dinner there. The atmosphere was perfect, beautiful, we had a round table, there were 6 of us. I loved the crispy brussel sprouts appetizers, which I normally would not have ordered, but they were amazing. Also the garden salad had strawberries in it and was so tasty. I had the Oak Plank King Salmon and ordered it with broccolini instead of the lima bean cous cous. It was crunchy on the outside and very tender inside. Delicious, lovely and memorable family dinner. Excellent service. The drinks were a bit wild. Everything is organic. This is a must do restaurant. And we toured the movie theater next door, which is some high end movie theater. This was at the Scottsdale Quarter. Wow, loved it!"}
{"text":"We celebrated Father's Day at Tanzy and IPic. Both were good experiences.  Other reviewers must have been on off days. We had a great experience.  We didn't like our seat, and asked for a window, no problem, we were moved as soon as one came available. We ordered the brunch. all the dishes arrived quickly and were HOT, which is a pet peeve of mine.  Our waiter Tyler was outstanding. Very friendly and attentive. Really super service.  We'd definitely go back again and ask for Tyler. He was superb!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Tanzy. We come in almost every Sunday for brunch. The quartet of mimosas is awesome and the brunch choices are wonderful. The build your own omlette, chicken caesar salad and Tanzy burger are all delicious choices. In all of our time coming here,  we have never had anything we didn't like. Carla was our bartender this last visit and she made our dining experience absolutely fabulous. She is very outgoing and delightful to speak with. Very knowledgeable about the menu and cocktail offerings. She always makes us feel at home here."}
{"text":"Tanzy has so much potential within it that I'm just glad I got the the 1000 PTs from Open Table as this ship hit an ice berg that would sink the USS Enterprise within hours.  Some of the reviews I had read were spotty, but still chose to give Tanzy the opportunity to impress me.  Tanzy did this right away when the hostess took our table with an awesome and gracious personality, we sat overlooking the promenade below which gave it an overwhelmingly romantic motif.  Our waiter was bright and heartwarming, although he noticed he wouldn't be getting a high tip upon our choice to share and not have drinks he still executed well...to a point.  I'll get to that later.  The decor and a second floor locale give Tanzy an awesome date night location for many couples, it is split between actual seating and couches up front which I can only guess are really meant for patrons wanting light fare before entering a feature at the adjacent and connected iPic theater.  The seating is the split by a high wall and curtain with tables and booths overlooking the above mentioned promenade and lamp shades that give in a twirl and then the back is separate with a wine vault, no one seemed to be occupying the seating.  As I said, there's so much going for this place.  Hitting the ice berg, when your service flames out and the bathroom experience is better than your dining experience.  We ordered the Parma Salami and the Shrimp Linguine, before our food arrived I knew that the busser was not well trained, or was inadequate, but then I'll give more details following the arrival of my food.  But she brought the neighboring table's food, which I had been a victim of in the past but rather than doing dirty to them like was done to me we stated it was not ours and it was delivered.  She said she miscounted, but I just think she was bad.  Now when it comes to timing of food I don't expect my main to come out with my appetizer at the same exact time, especially when my main is hot.  So we had to initiate and devour main dish. The Shrimp and Pesto linguine to taste was just awesome, the parma salami as a deconstructed bruschetta was interesting and tasted amazing, although I would not have had cheese toast.  In the midst of our time the waiter spoke to us asking if our dishes tasted good and we mentioned they were awesome.  So that was two strikes and I was going to go for a three star.  But once we were finished, plates on the table we got passed by another waiter probably 15 times, the busser had cleaned and reset the other table ignoring us, I definitely made eye contact with the other busser and nothing happened.  This whole detent seemed to last for fifteen minutes  before the manager noticed and cleared our plates, I then waited a long time for the check to arrive.  And then I went into one of the most expensive restrooms ever, that was an experience to behold.  The food saves Tanzy from being a no go zone, for how expensive of a resto Tanzy could get provided you're not splitting a meal.  This staff needs to be drilled, the kitchen needs to be drilled for timing, I shouldn't get a hot main exactly at the same time as my appetizer.  So much potential with decor and actual culinary skill that it just isn't worth coming back even if I got another 1000 pt table."}
{"text":"I love Tanzy atmosphere however the service is very slow, the mix drinks are too sweet and expensive for what you get.   I did enjoy a great dirty martini and love the hanging olives"}
{"text":"Listen gents, if you have a girl and you're going to take her to the movies at the iPic, cut her some slack and take her to dinner first at Tanzy. You can't go wrong here, their food is AMAZING! Their fish, scallops (you HAVE to try the scallops, EVERYTHING seriously is amazing on their menu. Try their Table-side House made Mozzarella, it's out of this world and it's so amazing to see it made right in front of your eyes.  Their staff is awesome, from the hostess to the bartender to the servers. It's a PRIME spot for dinner, awesome place for date night and props to the chef, you're killing it in the kitchen.  They will ask you if you're seeing a movie so that they make sure your food comes out in a timely manner. If you're rushed, don't worry, they will bring the food to you inside the movie theater. Completely organized.  Go, go, go! It's so worth it!"}
{"text":"Another great restaurant addition to Scottsdale Quarter!  The decor is beautiful, the service was fantastic and the food was great!  We tried the grilled calamari (to die for), the fried brussel sprouts (also to die for) and the mozzarella - all were divine!  They also have a great wine selection and the bartender was so helpful in helping us choose the perfect wine."}
{"text":"Five stars for the AMAZING interior architecture and sexy ambiance! Negative stars for the taste of food and quality. My pasta sauce was sour in taste, and our desert was freezer burned. Our server was sweet and made a great effort to communicate in a seasoned, well versed manor, but overall a rookie at luxury service. The restaurant is so beautiful inside but lacks the quality in experience and flavors."}
{"text":"Great location and atmosphere. Slightly pricey but good food. You must do the fresh.cheese table side. That is with the visit alone!!"}
{"text":"A little pricey but worth it:) my family had a great experience. Food, Bev & service were right on. Best dish was the Fiocchi with cheese & Pear, amazing! We ordered 2 of them. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Really exquisite food. Was seated promptly for our 8:15pm reservation. Waiter did not come to our table for about 20 minutes. Asked gentleman refilling our water to get the attn of our waiter. Our waiter, Charles, came over immediately and was effusively apologetic. Offered us a free dessert and threw in lattes with free appetizers for our next visit. Manager came over to also apologize. Total class act. Look forward to our next visit and strongly urge others to try the mozzarella with fig and prosciutto. Really everything we ate was fantastic. Would post photos but we demolished everything. :)"}
{"text":"I stopped in on a Friday night because a friend of mine wanted to go here. While this establishment is full of dating couples, match.com people and just out for a night, I decide to order the Pizza Sauce Bloody Mary. I have seen this made before and it is a beautiful beverage. In the menu the description says house cucumber lime vodka or Chinaco Silver Estate Tequila ( which would be a Bloody Maria I think), salt and pepper rim, Antipasti skewer and celery bitters. We all know Bloody Mary's come with celery and olives. I was served olives and a normal Bloody Mary mix, as apparently Tanzy ran out of supplies. The drink is not pretty like I have seen before and when I address the situation the bartender said \"we are out of everything, we got slammed on Sunday.\" Are you effin kidding me? It's Friday. You mean to tell me in five days time nobody could make it to a store or get a delivery? My level of disappointment is shocking. I dine in almost every restaurant in this area. The Scottsdale Quarter is very trendy, relatively expensive and has the ability to host so many people. Having said that, to give such a lame excuse for a patron bringing up a poorly made beverage is sad. Being that Scottsdale insists on charging $10.00 for a Bloody Mary, I expect a sexy beverage that I have seen in the past. Consistency is key in this industry. When you wonder why Eddie V's is alive well  it's because they try very hard to have a great guest experience. Good thing you guys have IPic money to support you."}
{"text":"Review is based on lunch only. Came during the week and really enjoyed the vibe and decor, seemingly artisanal cuisine. I will have to say this place threw me a curve ball walking up, it is not what I expected to dine. Definitely enjoyed the experience and atmosphere.   Only ordered a salad which was creatively presented on the plate. I would love to come back and try a full course meal.   Other than that, I have high hopes for Tanzy and myself -  it's a great restaurant in the north scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour, great place. Service was awesome, drinks were good and apps were tasty. The atmosphere was really nice and had a open feel to the outside. Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Our group of 4 was so excited to try out Tanzy but unfortunately our experience was a disaster. It started the moment our server discovered we were ordering from the Restaurant Week menu and went down from there. We had to ask for a refill of bread 4 times before we finally got it. Water refills were rare and they ran out of dessert. We were told the dessert would be available in 45 min. and we decided to wait. At that time we were told there would be not chocolate cake. A couple of minutes later we saw trays of cake being carried to the party room in the back, they did have cake but not for non-VIPs like us. It took forever to even get our bill. We then went downstairs to True Foods- where we had the chocolate cake that we paid for at Tanzy but didn't get. . Our service at True Foods was outstanding and our server was very attentinve even though we were not spending a lot of money. We recommend True Foods over Tanzy."}
{"text":"Tanzy opened in 2010, has a nice atmosphere, a superb wine list, and great service. We had the Chilean Sea Bass and a Ribeye and both were expertly prepared. The second floor location does allow side tables a nice view down below."}
{"text":"The servers are nice and the presentation of the food was fairly sophisticated, but the actual taste of the food was disappointing. We ordered a large veriety of things and to be honest none of it was good at all. I suggest going to dinner elsewhere and just ordering drinks/desert at Tanzy aka iPics."}
{"text":"Dear Tanzy,  Today you sadly disappointed in the service you provided. I spoke so very highly of your brunch buffet with unlimited mimosas, but sadly things did not go as planned.   Let me start by saying that although the day ended not as planned, all of your staff were quite nice, very friendly, and extremely apologetic. I arrived on time and checked in, and I let the hostess know that my dining companions were running late but I still wanted let them know that I was there since I had made the reservation ( which by the way was cancelled on opentable after I checked in but that is another story) .  5 mins later another dining companion arrived and we were seated while we waited for others.  (FYI there was a total of 8 of us including my friend's daughter) Kevin our waiter introduced himself and let us know that he along with another waiter would be taking care of us. Score!  We get to fabulous men to take care of us. We were offered the endless mimosas but were SADLY informed that the brunch buffet that was once before offered was no more and that a new menu for brunch was being introduced.  I was so disappointed as that was the main reason why I had picked Tanzy as I had raved about the brunch buffet and how good it was.  This should have been our queue as to what was to come.  Fast forward to around 11:30 and the rest of our party finally arrived. Everyone was happy to so each other and Kevin came by to offer the unlimited mimosas and again let us know that he and another waiter would be taking care of us. Cool. 10 mins later we are ready to order and regretfully our waiters are no where to be found. 20 mins go by and we are still waiting for our waiters so my friend went to the hostess desk  to ask where our waiters were and the hostess herself graciously came over to take our orders. But then we wait, and wait, and wait. We see other tables that came in after we did, get served there meal, eat, and leave. We even asked a party that was across from us, who came in at the same time that we did, if they had even ordered yet as they appeared to be waiting just as long as were were. An hour and 15 mins later ( not kidding) we finally say we are done. I go and look for our waiter and say please cancel our order because we are leaving.   The manager comes out and apologies and comps our drinks but we were still disappointed. I am not sure what happened today but after speaking your praises   you let me down as well as all my girlfriends. Will I be back? Maybe but it will be awhile. Seriously  Tanzy, you dropped the ball today.  Love,  Ebony  PS Bring back that yummy buffet please!  Update 11.12.12: I received a phone call and an email from the General Manager Michael  today. WOW! Thank you for both the call and email. You went above and beyond what I expected. For that I give you 5 stars ( but I won't change the stars on this particular review) But again just wow, thank you!!! See I told you guys that the staff was great! :)"}
{"text":"We had a great experience for a small birthday party.  The Wait: I made reservations on Opentable and arrived at Tanzy about 15 minutes before the rest of my party. The hostesses offered me a seat at the bar, and I hung out there for a few minutes. From that point on, every interaction with wait staff was pleasant and accommodating.   The Food: Our waiter gave a couple recommendations and we ordered the table-side mozerella and crispy brussel sprouts. The table-side cheese was pretty good. I liked the show more than the dish itself, but we couldn't keep our hands off the fried sprouts. The tangy aioli sauce was so delicious that we dipped our bread into it.  The main courses were short ribs, peppercorn crusted ribeye and the pan seared branzino. The short ribs were by far the best. They are as good, if not better, than any other restaurants I've been to. You don't need a knife because a fork shreds the succulently sweet and rich meat. I really enjoyed my ribeye because it was huge (16 oz?) and cooked to a medium rare the way I like it. It was a fattier cut and some bits were chewier than I like. Though, the taste overwhelmed any complaints I may have had. I didn't have enough room to try the branzino, but I heard great reviews at the table.   The Staff: We had our own cake and the waiter was more than happy to cut it for us and brought out candles. After we were done, he took our pictures and whisked us into the special events area to take a few more with their gigantic, clear wine rack wall.  We didn't try any cocktails, but I remember them being creative and incredible the first time I was here for a Yelp event. I've also had their frozen beverage at iPic (literally next door), which was very good too.  Great overall restaurant experience in the Scottsdale Quarter that offers a trendy bar and the coolest movie theater in the state built in."}
{"text":"Went here for a Happy Hour with a friend.  The drinks were amazing, but the male server in the lounge has off-putting.  I asked if they had Happy Hour specials and he said \"Yes\" and just stood there.  I had to kind of guide him into getting me a Happy Hour menu.  As a Guest, that is not what I expect from a place like Tanzy.  Probably won't be back and won't suggest it to anyone as a good HH spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour at the bar and really enjoyed it. I love the ambiance, very hip.  We had great service at about 6pm.  It started getting pretty busy at around 6:45.  They have a really delightful HH menu...decent prices except I do think their antipasti could be a little better deal.  We ordered a salami platter and while delicious, kind of pricey for what you get.  That's the only reason I'm docking a star because we did really enjoy ourselves."}
{"text":"There were some imperfections, but overall I am really impressed.  Setting: We had a party of 10 here for restaurant week. the ambiance was really nice, even for someone who lives in Scottsdale and is used to beautification.  Food: The portions are healthy. Both the Calamari and the brussels sprout first courses were great. The short rib was right up there with St. Francis and Chelsea's (but you can't get an egg on it) and the gnocchi was flat out amazing. The only disappointment were the desserts. The red velvet pudding and the flourless cake (the latter was more like a pudding than the former) were both really, really bland.  Service: We were not greeted for 15-20mins, which most of us in the party did not notice since we were all catching up with each other. The food came out a little slow and staggered - they explained their computer crashed. However, they were extremely apologetic and attentive after acknowledging their mistakes without us even bringing it to their attention. In my mind, they turned a negative into a positive here.  Summary: Given that most valley restaurants I have tried, try to take the chintzy route for restaurant week, Tanzy really stepped up. The first and second courses were so amazing they made up for their other shortcomings. I write this as I am eating 2-day old short rib I heated up in the microwave, which still tastes wonderful. If they can master their desserts, they will be complete. I would give them 4.5 stars if Yelp's interface allowed it."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to grab lunch after a rough day of shopping (haha). We decided to check out Tanzy as we have not been here before and opted for a high top table by the bar. Our bartender/waitress, Michelle, was super nice and honest with recommendations (it was her first day so she was honest about not trying some items that we asked about). We both ordered cocktails, myself the Strawberry-Bourbon Julep that was delicious, but you can definitely taste the JB, and my friend ordered the Prickly Pear & Arizona Honey 'Rita (I liked mine better, but that may be because of the heavily salted rim on her glass). Both drinks/all of those specialty drinks are $11 each.  For our entree, I couldn't decide between the Prosciutto, Balsamic Fig & Melon Flatbread ($12) or the Tanzy Sandwich ($11). I went to our pleasant Bartender/Waitress, Michelle, who then deferred the question to Dale who suggested the Flatbread because of the salty/sweet combination of flavors, and I was sold. My friend opted for the Turkey Brie Panini ($10). Hers came with fries and mine didn't, but we both agreed mine was the better choice, thanks Dale! And as a side note, my entree would also be enjoyable as an appetizer.  We enjoyed both our food and drinks while also enjoying the view of the fountain and watching the kiddies play (in the non pedophile way) and the MILF's (some in bathing suits, which was questionable) lounging in chairs. The decor inside the restaurant is just as lovely and the bathroom was very clean. I did find it odd that there are only two, very large stales, and they both don't have seat liners, but whateves, my quads and hamies could use the work out.   The total lunch bill for two alcoholic drinks and two entrees came to about $43.00 which is on the high end of things, but if we skipped the drinks it would be more reasonable. We would both come back :)"}
{"text":"You really can't beat the Tuesday ladies night happy hour.  The sparkling sangria is delicious.  I shared the burger and fries with a friend and couldn't complain.  Service is always great!!"}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the bar and drinks. I did not have dinner here.  Beautiful spot, great ambiance. The front opens up completely so when the weather is nice the lounge area overlooks the Champagne room.  Looks like a nice place to have dinner.  It was nice until all of the cougars showed up on Friday night. :/"}
{"text":"1st this is a review of their food only, we did not stay at the restaurant! They have three options. 1) Tanzy Restaurant - Dine In 2) Tanzy Express - Take Out 3) iPic Experience - Dine in the movie theater  We did option three, first the price is a little high. But when you are already willing to spend on a iPic experience, then you might as well go all out. Which I did taking out my two favorite girls! I had their Angus burgers sliders, truffle fries, and a diet coke. Sliders were excellent! A lot of flavor, cooked at medium well. Truffle fries were a little salty. But then again, I do not add salt to anything so I am the wrong person to advise on salt!! Wife had the pepperoni flat bread, since I had some! It was pretty good, thought it was a regular pizza. Daughter had the burger sliders and tater tots w/bacon ketchup! Daughter has always been a tater tot person and she was not disappointed! She kept on telling us how great the bacon ketchup was! SO!!  FOOD!! - was great, will eat there food again!! PRICE! - A bit high, but with the experience! It was well worth it!  Hopefully I can write you a update on the restaurant experience instead of the iPic experience?"}
{"text":"We typically stop in before going to a movie. You know, it's a bonus to see your food! The food here is pretty good, nothing mind blowing.  The service was a huge issue. We have always had great service but last week we waited for everything. We almost missed the beginning of our movie because our server disappeared. It was not busy, just inattentive staff."}
{"text":"Love coming here with the girls on Tuesday's for ladies night before we go to ipic. Usually we seat on the couches and have some wine. The place has cute atmosphere and good hh. We came yesterday and they had an event there so we sat at the bar. Didn't get greeted at all finally the male bartender asked rudely what we wanted we said we weren't ready yet. After that he didn't come back. We waived him down and he says oh are you ready now?! Umm customer service ?! We asked about the wine we usually get on hh he rudely said hh is over. Which is fine but I like that wine Mr. Personality! We asked when the hh was over he said at 7 we asked what time it was, he said 7. Not a big deal we just had the same wine at ipic where we didn't have to deal with a rude bartender with no work ethic. Def will steer clear of him next time I am there."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I received a gift card to use for the iPic theaters and we also heard that we could use the card at Tanzy as well.  We called ahead to confirm this which they said was not a problem and we also made a reservation for dinner on a Saturday night.  We are both no strangers to eating at fine restaurants, but this one had eluded us for now.  We arrived and were promptly seated in a very spacious booth that could have fit 8 people easily.  Our waitress did a fine job, until the end(see later) and we definitely enjoyed our meal very much.  Beverages were refilled promptly and all of our needs were met.  We ordered tableside mozzarella which was very yummy.  You get to pick the kind of salt, olive oil and balsamic to go with it.  For dinner, I had the short rib, gnocchi and spinach, all of which was cooked great.  My girlfriend had the swordfish with fingerling potatoes which was also done well.  The plates were definitely put together and looked great as well.  Being that we had a gift card, which wouldn't even come close to covering our bill, I placed both my credit card and the gift card with the check.  I looked at the total and had already calculated out my 25% tip because they had done such an exceptional job making our evening enjoyable.    However, when the bill came back, I noticed something odd that wasn't their before, big circles around the original total at the bottom of the receipt.  Not sure if that is common practice, but I know that there are people out there that do not know how to tip properly and because we were young people, it was done to \"remind\" me what the original total of the bill was so I can tip on that amount.  Thanks, I remember that my bill was almost $140 for 2 people to eat.    So to sum it all up, good food amazing atmosphere and decor.  But in the end, they made me feel like I didn't belong in a \"fine\" dining restaurant and left me with a bad taste in my mouth walking out the door.  I probably would not return because there are better places to go that their servers are not allowed to do such things."}
{"text":"Management more than stepped up to the plate to address the challenges from our Mother's Day visit. We really enjoyed a top-notch brunch with friendly, excellent service. Even a couple management members stopped by our table to talk and ask how the food was. By the way, the food was well prepared, tasty, timely and well presented. It's such a relief to see that this awesome establishment quickly correct any deficiencies. Hats off to all, we'll be back, and will continue to point guests and friends toward Tanzy's front door."}
{"text":"High praises for the attentive service and friendly staff, but that's about it.  The experience began with cocktails; a fruit martini tasting almost clinical due its unbalanced high vodka, low fruit ratio, and a Manhattan ordered with 'only one or two rocks' served up in a full glass of ice. Two for two thus far.  The lobster salad, (Valentine's Day menu) a mountainous pile of frisee with a few small chunks of lobster buried deep within, made for a nice game of hide and seek as I watched my date feverishly pick through the lettuce in search of what little lobster was embedded within.  The cedar planked salmon entree was another huge disappointment.  A good cedar planked salmon should have the aroma, smoke coloring and caramelization of, well, cedar planked salmon.  This was anything but.  This salmon, while cooked properly, was tasteless, other than its normal salmon flavor. Now, plop it onto a flat, (non-fluffy pile) wet, soggy serving of cous cous and you've really got a plateful of disappointment.  We also ordered the duck, which was delivered roasted and rare.  So rare, it was like cutting raw chicken due to it being so flubbery. But again, as I mentioned, the staff was extremely helpful in bringing out a new plate of duck, this instead of the kitchen simply heating up the unwanted serving.  After this level of disappointment, desserts were out of the question, but interestingly enough, our server never even offered us to see a dessert menu.  How weird is that? It was like he had ESP.  Throughout dinner, a woman, (we surmised a floor manager) paced the dining area as if overseeing the staff. Too bad she didn't stop by to inquire how our meal was or if everything was alright. Another disappointment.  Ironically, if you read other Yelp reviews of Tanzy, nearly all of them feature a management response, either praising Yelpers for their high marks, or, apologizing for their less than stellar experience.  Tanzy, please, there's no need to respond.  I don't want an apology, or some lame reason why things weren't the way they should've been. I'm afraid that would be much too little, too late. The time for that was while we were still captive within your domain.  What you should do instead is: Gordon Ramsey your Executive Chef. Make the mixologist sample his / her creations until they bleed vodka out of their eyes. And finally, have the person frantically pacing the aisles put a smile on her face and actually interface with the patrons, asking about their experience... seemingly pretending to give a poo."}
{"text":"I was going to give this restaurant 3 stars until I received the bill , but Let me back track and tell you about my experience here... My husband and I walked in and were greeted by the bartender. He gave us our menus and said our server would be right with us. After 7 minutes, our server still hadn't passed by and the bartender asked us if he had come to our table. We told him no and he asked us what we would like to eat. It is Sunday and the only menu they have is a brunch menu that doesn't have many options or variety. The brunch menu is $19.99 for every entree on the menu. I  finally decided on the chicken and waffle sandwich and the bartender said that their waffle machine \"exploded this morning\" so they had pancakes instead. Pancakes get really soggy so I went with a salad. There are only 2 salads on their brunch menu: chicken Caesar salad and a shrimp and roasted beet salad. Again, both these salads are $19.99. So I decided on the Caesar but instead of chicken I wanted the shrimp that was on the other salad and my husband ordered the burger medium. While we were waiting, the server FINALLY appeared and brought us the monkey bread they are trying to promote from their new brunch menu. I took one bite and didn't go any further because it was a very dry cinnamon roll. Gross. Our food finally comes and my husband's burger is well done and dry. The shrimp on the salad tasted good...they were probably 16/20 (nothing out of this world) and they were grilled. The croutons however were nasty...rather than baking them like normal people would do, they were fried. Totally dumped in the fryer basket and pulled out. I was eating pure grease. The potato latka fries were good. Then the bill comes. The burger was $19.99 and my salad was $28.99???? What. The. Fuck. I thought this was obviously a mistake because we didn't order any drinks and both salads were the same price. When I asked, he said that because I had substituted the shrimp it was $9 more. Really? How stupid do I look? Firstly, the upcharge was never stated at the time of order and secondly, if there is another salad with shrimp on the menu that is the same price, why would you charge $9 in addition to the already super overpriced Caesar salad that is $19.99 to begin with??? I didn't ask for shrimp in ADDITION to the chicken...it was a substitution. Thirdly, I'm a chef and have been in the F&B business for many years. That is not how to treat your patrons. The manager never came to apologize because he's incompetent and doesn't know anything about how to run a business.  That was the first and last time I will ever dine at Tanzy."}
{"text":"A perfectly safe corporate restaurant incorporating recent trends in Italian and making them palatable to the trend following yet unadventurous Scottsdale majority.  Solid mozzarella and seafood options.  Not destination by any means but a solid pairing with a movie next door."}
{"text":"Food was ok, didn't think it was worth the price, If I order a 30+ steak I expect to finish it because it was good, which I didn't.  I did eat most though, and as a southerner I really liked the \"new southern\" sides, Lima bean amd corn mix with a almost bread pudding style parmesan stuffing. The atmosphere is fun, but dark! :)"}
{"text":"Okay nice ambiance and good drinks but the manager needs to be a little more in touch with what's going on.  Walking the quarter in 110 degree weather so we stopped in for a drink and they have a fire feature. . Shocking that their are open seats everywhere.  Seriously we are even burning up at the bar 30 feet away!"}
{"text":"Food  was surprisingly good.  The staff always nice and attentive.  Definitely worth going to and checking it out.  They have a great happy hour."}
{"text":"The ambiance gets  atleast 4 stars.  The service should also get 4 stars.  Food is definitely 3 stars which makes consolidated review a 3/5 However for all the hype and hoopla I was not expecting my Meditarranean Chicken entree to be rubbery.  The tables were pretty lavish and for a staurday night it wasn't overwhelmingly crowded. it sure was getting there though. The lighting is just perfect for a couple's date out. and the swanky comfortable and long tables can easily fit in 4 and maybe even 6.  The complimentary bread served was warm and fresh. We went for the trio hummus dip which was except for the olive tapenade . I wasn't too fascinated by the toasty bread either which I felt was not fitting in with the others in the trio. The cocktails were good and the draught beer was served chilled with the perfect head. The meditarranean chicken entree was a lil watery and the chicken itself was rubbery. This was the major turn off. The desert menu did not have a great variety and definitely needs some rethinking.  All in all not greatly impressed but not too bad either,"}
{"text":"The location is so beautiful for a weekend brunch, but ever since they changed the menu it has been a total disappointment. Place was EMPTY this time for brunch. Maybe they'll get the hint that something has to change. Unfortunately, we brought guests this time. We should have known better. Literally 5 different things were ordered & no one was impressed by a single plate. Eat just about anywhere else."}
{"text":"Started dancing there last Friday night !  Dj is a guy that plays for the suns.  Bongo drums and sax player too lots of fun good music.  Hope they continue. They may add Saturdays in the future.   Was a pretty good crowd last night due to Raven having a event.  Time is from 9 pm to 1"}
{"text":"Didn't like DJ on Saturdays food was ok, but the drinks were sweet!!! The dirty martini was good, love the olives on the outside. The non-alcoholic cocktails were AWESOME!!! The ambience was good, but 1/2 empty restaurant on a Saturday night!"}
{"text":"About a month ago, a girls' night out brought us for dinner at Tanzy and a movie at iPic after. It was easy to make reservations and add a couple people last minute. It was a Friday early evening at around 5:30pm and there were probably only a couple other tables seated. The rest of the people were enjoying their happy hour, which probably would've been smart of us to do but we were on a slight time crunch since we were going to see a movie at around 7.  As soon as we informed our waiter, Adrien, he made sure to get our orders in quickly and efficiently. He said typically the hostess informs them if dinner is followed by a movie to make things run more smoothly during dinner. The service was great. There were no lulls waiting for anything since he wanted to make sure we'd make our movie.  We all ordered prickly pear margaritas. They were girly, fruity and awesome but hey, it was a girls' night indeed so we had to fulfill the whole persona right?  They loved the mozzarella tableside. It was almost overwhelming to my friends because there was just too many options for personalized mozzarella, but for good reason. It's seldom you have options like truffle oil and Himalayan sea salt when making mozzarella.   The thing I loved most that evening was unexpected. The waiter recommended branzino. The silky flesh was still filling but not dense. It was fresh, flavorful, and highly enjoyable. I searched for other types of fish with this flavor and texture but to no avail. I guess I'll have to come back to Tanzy to have it again."}
{"text":"Mind you, I didn't eat here myself. My parents had their 30th wedding anniversary dinner here. My mother had let slip where they were going so I called ahead and asked for the meal to be charged to my credit card and asked them to send out some special things on my behalf.   The managers at Tanzy were very accommodating on the phone and understood exactly what I needed. Everything was executed perfectly   My parents said they had a lovely time, that it was a very nice ambiance with a very nice view.  Thanks Tanzy!"}
{"text":"This place went downhill fast. Pretty obvious they changed owners/mgmt. The food is now horrible. Service and quality of staff is low class now. I used to like this place. I guess it's what everyone tells me in Scottsdale. You gotta be top notch or you'll be out of business, fast. This place is in obvious trouble. Whomever is running it *must* know they're doing a poor job. It's that bad.  Staff at the bar were obvious amateurs. Couldn't make a quality drink if their life depended on it. They used to have quality staff - no more."}
{"text":"I recently visited tanzy before viewing at Ipic. The food and service was outstanding. The bartenders have a great array of drinks and recommendations. The service was great and very attentive. The food is by far the best thing there. The brussel sprouts and calamari appetizers were out of this world. The calamari is not bar food calamari that has been fried, instead its sauteed and is very fresh. For my main dish I had the seafood ciopinno. It was a wide variety of fresh seafood over pasta and the spices used were to perfection. I will continue to eat here before going to the movies and I recommend you do that same!"}
{"text":"i am writing a review based on the Yelp Elite event held tonight. although doubtful i could ever afford to eat here regularly, the wife and i were treated to an extremely delightful night of food and wine.   every wine poured (i stuck mostly with the shiraz and the cabernet) was ridiculously smooth and rich. my glass never sat empty for 3 solid hours. i'm sorry i can't remember all the food dishes, but for starters, the bread plate with the arugula, candied figs, roasted red peppers....the soft mozzarella concotion....holy cow...it was like an episode of Top Chef. then the entrees....the cedar plank salmon, the scallops...oh my the scallops....so soft and buttery and melty in my mouthy....topped off with the red velvet bread pudding and flourless chocolate cake (the lightest flourless chocolate cake i've ever tasted) had me groaning in pain from a full belly, but writhing in pleasure from the taste. i imagine this must be what that dude in hell feels like as he's imbibing in lusty pleasures followed by tenacious torture....  Jill, the server for our section, was exquisite. she not only kept the wine flowing and the food plentiful, she was so excited to explain each dish and wine serving, often pulling up a chair to converse for long periods of time, how she loved the dishes and how much she enjoyed working at Tanzy.   everything was perfect. there were 2 meat app's and 2 meat entrees that we didn't partake in but our fellow revelers had no issues devouring. a wonderful, wonderful evening of dining pleasure."}
{"text":"We went for drinks and dinner for restaurant week. The bar service was terrible and the 13 dollar drinks were weak and not served with the appropriate garnishes. No fruit in a vodka club soda and no olive in a martini. The bar tender was inattentive and clearly not comfortable or experienced as a bartender. So we paid our over priced bar tab and moved to the dining room for dinner hoping our experience would be better and we were equally disappointed. Our waitress was average with not much personality but she did ok. Our soup came out with out spoons. Three of our party of four ordered the scallops and Brussels sprouts. The scallops were good the Brussels sprouts not Cooked and almost raw. The manager stopped by to ask how our food was and informed us that he was wondering as he just got back from vacation and had not had a chance to try it. Not something you should share with your customers. Desert was butter cake that tastes nothing like butter cake. We were very disappointed as this place has great atmosphere and location. Due to the poor service and quality of drinks and food we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of dining at tanzy on multiple occasions.  Its definitely a welcome change in the scottsdale quarter.  For once there is a restaurant that wasnt slapped together.  They really seem to have taken their time and done it right.    The food is absolutely awesome.  Ive had everything from steaks to seafood, and i have not had a bad meal yet!  Cheers to the chef(s)!    I am also very impressed by the service staff.  From the servers to the bartenders, they are professionals in every sense of the word.  Their recommendations are always spot on!  I just wish they had a happy hour so i could sit in the lounge with that super cool door open.  (The whole front of the restaurant is a huge hinged door that opens up like a patio!!!)  The whole iPic idea is really neat.  If you havnt been I suggest you check it out.  Dinner at Tanzy, then a movie (Gold class all the way!), then drinks at salt.  Does it get any better than one-stop shopping like that?  I think not"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar and waited for the rest of my party to arrive.  Even though the place wasn't very busy it took the bartender at least 15 minutes to ask if I needed anything.   I guess being the only one sitting at the bar and making eye contact isn't enough anymore.  After being seated I ordered the Tanzy Salad, which for being named after the restaurant should be showcase the chefs cuisine.  I also requested a side of chicken for a bit more protein.  The salad and dressing were blah and boring and the chicken breast was dry.  If I am in the area again and wanting to have Mediterranean food I am going to NORTH, where the restaurant isn't as glamorous, but the food is excellent.  I would reserve this place for cocktails only."}
{"text":"Like Salt, which is right next door, this is a very nice bar, in a very good location.  We had very good service all 3 times we've been there.  Haven't eaten there, so can't comment on the food.  Excellent bar/couch setup."}
{"text":"The outdoor seating could become legendary at this location once more people learn about it. I mean it is simply magnificent....go at night if you can and I can promise you it is romantic...exotic...and exciting all rolled into one. Since it is near the IPIC theatre in the Scottsdale quarter...it makes for a great location to go and grab dinner once your movie has concluded. The most awesome thing about the whole place though is the fire cauldrons that are located near the escalators as you walk into the restaurant....WOW. So if your ever in the quarters and want something a little different but yet the same at least by Scottsdale's lofty standards....then pay a visit to Tanzy. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here again to give it another try. Service was still friendly and great. Our server, Sofia and Peter (the Manager) were excellent. Decided to try Table Side Warm Mozzarella with Prosciutto di San Danielle ( served with basil pesto, roasted tomatoes, ciabatta crostini, four kinds of salt, balsamic vinegar, olive oil and truffle oil), Pan Seared Scallops (roasted brussel sprouts, pancetta, braised cipollini onions, thyme-veal jus), Wagyu Skirt Steak (Yukon gold potato tortas, broccolini, salsa verde, truffled bearnaise  and Tanzy steak sauces), Concord Cake (chocolate mousse, chocolate meringue, chocolate cake, chocolate ganache, chocolate sauce, whipped cream) and Coffee & Doughnuts (vanilla-dusted doughnuts, mocha mousse, chocolate feuilletine, frozen coffee pebbles, coffee caramel).  The second time around, the food was definitely improved and better. No need to add more salt for flavors. Everything from the apps to the desserts was delicious and tasty. Will come back next time to try their pasta dish."}
{"text":"We booked a brunch reservation for 8 online, then followed up with a call to indicate it was a celebration of 2 family birthdays this week and we would have 2 small children in our group.  The restaurant is beautiful, everyone was very nice, and the food wasn't too bad.  Once we finally got it.    We were seated for a full 35 minutes before any wait staff person came over.  He introduced himself along with his trainee who hung behind.  He asked if we wanted water and some said yes while others tried to order different beverages as he just walked away.  Water came 10 minutes later by the trainee who promptly disappeared without taking our order.    Eventually the trainee returned, alone, but did not know the menu so with each question he had to run and ask someone.  No gluten-free anything. The French toast has bacon in it and no they don't make it without.  We have no green tea.  We're out of some salad ingredients but will bring you what we have.  And on it went.  Also note that at this point we had been there over an hour and there were only three other tables occupied in the restaurant.    Next the trainee returns to tell us there is a computer problem so our order hasn't gone to the kitchen yet.  We had been there over an hour!!We commented that our experience was not going very well, had hungry children, and when did he think we might be served.  \"We will try to bring out the kids food as soon as we can.  Do you need to be somewhere or are you going to a movie?\"  Seriously?  Our food finally was served 1 1/2 hours after we arrived, minus 2 orders that they forgot and brought ten minutes later.    I ate about two bites of my food because the cheese in my omelet tasted off and the hash browns were the consistency of a lump of mashed potatoes.  I honestly expected someone to ask if there was a problem but that never happened.  Others said their food was ok, and in fact the French toast was very good but definitely did not have bacon in it.  So several of us wished we had ordered it had we not been misinformed.    Other than our trainee waiter, no one else ever came to our table, offered us coffee, acknowledged the birthdays even though there were cards and gifts in plain sight.  We were given the check by our very pleasant but \"definitely not ready for prime time\" server who said he hoped to see us again soon.  I don't think so.  Sorry, Tanzy, but there are way too many good restaurants here for us not to get the food and service we deserve."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting a friend, and he suggested we try Scottsdale Quarter for shopping & restaurants.  There are a ton of restaurants in Scottsdale Quarter, and Tanzy seemed to have the most diverse menu and great decor.  Everything about this place oozes cool.  PROS: 1.  Ambience - the restaurant has beautiful, modern decor and attracts a young, upscale crowd.  As you enter, there is large lounge area with sofas which makes it great for large groups to relax together.  We actually ate in the lounge area and it was comfortable and relaxing.  2. Food - I tried a mozzarella bruschetta appetizer that is made in front of you which was a nice touch and also tried a pasta dish for my entree.  Both dishes tasted good and the presentation looked fantastic.  CONS: 1. Service - the service is so-so.  As I mentioned, we chose to sit in the lounge area, and our waitress would check-in on us every 20-30 minutes even though the restaurant was pretty quiet.  Our glasses were empty and took us awhile to get our entree order in after getting appetizers.  2. Price - the two of us ordered 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and a couple of drinks each.  Total cost about $110 (including tax & tip).  A little pricey.  Overall, I would visit this restaurant again once or twice a year for special occasions and group events."}
{"text":"Excellent service from the bar staff! Tommy is our favorite; kept us in stitches with his Eddie Murphy impressions. We had a few appetizers:  TRIO OF DIP: 3 tiny, yet tasty servings of each (hummus, olive tapenade, artichoke  aioli)  with crustini's and pita bread wedges.  BEEF CARPACCIO: wonderfully tender and sliced paper thin. The Organic Arugula with Lemonette was a delightful pairing.  CALAMARI: BIG chunks of tender squid (no greasy batter here) sautéed with Artichoke Hearts, Capers and Roasted Tomatoes in a Garlic Butter and White Wine Sauce - this was a dee-lish meal!   Next time we HAVE to try the house-made mozzarella."}
{"text":"Wow!  Let's just say they didn't hold back spending money on this place.  All the glam, lights, and posh; there was not one spot they missed.  I can appreciate that, but just make sure your service and food can say the same.  I like a menu that doesn't try to go around the globe and try to fit everyones tastes.  Kudos, menu option was straight and to the point.  Service wasn't too bad either.  Though I believe the food could have been a tad better espcially for a place like this.  Too much wow - not enough pow for my taste buds. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I came in here during happy hour before I started some Christmas shopping. The place was basically empty as it always is when I come here... I was greeted quickly and brought a water. I took a minute to look over the wine selection and decided on a Napa Valley cab. The wine was fine but the  pour was kind of small. I looked over their happy hour food menu (because no one offered me a full menu) and decided to go with the Tuscan Kale salad. Before I was able to order, the bartender brought me the check which I thought was a little odd especially since no one had asked me if I wanted to order food or was ready. I kind of felt weird asking to order food at a restaurant. When the salad came out it was pretty good. Not the best that I've had but there was nothing wrong with it. The only complaint I do have is the portion size was TINY! I know it was the happy hour version but I did not expect it to be so small- also having to add cheese to a salad just doesn't feel right! I was not checked on again until I was done I don't know if the bartenders were new or just don't care when it's that slow but it didn't seem they knew how to provide exceptional customer service- instead only doing the basics."}
{"text":"Food was overcooked, and way to pricey for the quality. I try to experiment with new cocktails when I go out, and did not go well here. I will try it again, but only because it happens to share a lobby with iPic theaters."}
{"text":"When you first ride up the escalator (just if you are going to the theater), you will notice a very tall door.  I was taken back by how tall it was.  The hostess called it \"castle door\".  As the door is tall, so is their ceiling.  In fact every thing was including table was large. Nice large table and comfortable booth seat were very nice.  It wasn't too crowded when I went there for lunch this week.  With the high ceiling, I didn't even hear much of other customers' conversation.  Service was nice and our server took time to explain the lunch menu.  Per his recommendation we shared the grilled calamari appetizer.  Calamari was tender, not chewy at all, and great flavor.  They were not deep fried as seen at many places, healthy way to cook. They cooked with whole cloves of garlic but garlic wasn't overwhelming with garlicky taste.  For entrée, I had salmon.  Salmon itself was cooked to the perfection, but I didn't enjoy the leek came with the meal. It just didn't go well, it was too overwhelming. I would have preferred it was cooked longer.  Desert was interesting.  When I saw the word \"tiramisu\", I didn't even read the menu. I just ordered one. When it came, it didn't look like tiramisu.  The server explained it was explained on the menu.... I didn't read.. He explained that they use the same ingredients but it was constructed differently.  It was tasty nonetheless.  When I got to my office, I had to fight with food coma.  It was very difficult to stay awake until I had time to digest.  The server said if we are a member of the theater, second lunch is free.  I have to look into the membership as I enjoyed the unique food here."}
{"text":"I would have given this five stars if I like beef short ribs.    Since I'm not THAT carnivorous, I will give it four stars.   Sorry to those of you who like that much beef.   Went there last night with a friend.    We ordered the mozzarella pesto as our appetizer, and his main course was the short rib and mine was the chicken penne pasta.    The appetizer had quite an interesting presentation.   The server did quite a show of stretching the cheese and, then, presenting it in a designed manner.   It came with tomatoes, which seasoning was exquisite,  and pesto and some type of dry toast/cracker.    Seriously, we had been at the adjoining Salt Lounge for happy hour, and even though I thought I was starving, by the time we finished the appetizer, I was FULL!   The mozzarella, put atop the cracker, with the pesto and the prosciutto  and the seasoned tomatoes, I would kill for that recipe.   I make a darn good pesto -- if I say so myself -- but theirs was fabulous.   And the flavoring of the tomatoes, I wish I had the ingredients.    I would definitely make them myself.    Getting to the dinner, I LOVED my pasta.   The ingredients in it were the right mix.   I've had plenty of pasta with chicken, but this dish had the right mix of veggies, olives, seasoning, chicken, dunno.    Perfect with a capital P.   His short ribs, he loved.   Me, uhmmm, I'm not that much of a beef eater; I thought it was good, but considering the fact he loved it, I'm thinking it was good.      Would I go back?   You betcha!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been to this restaurant before and enjoyed it so we came back again tonight and it was god awful. The only reason it has two stars is because our poor waiter was so nice and obviously felt bad for us and we got our apps and one meal on the house.   First off our reservation was for 7 pm - we didn't get seated until 7:20, even though we were all there on time.   Secondly, our drinks were so weak. I've been a bartender, I know what a drink should taste like. I'm not an expert but Jesus Christ I can tell when there's no booze in a drink.  Third - one of our pasta dishes wasn't cooked AT ALL. Also this was 9:00 pm by the time we got our food, even though there was only 10 other tables there at this time. So they sent that dish back and it took 20 minutes to \"re-cook\" it. Then it wasn't even good!   I don't know what was going on tonight but the manager was in the kitchen the whole time so obviously shit was going down. There are plenty of other restaurants in kierland commons to go to that's waaaayyyy better."}
{"text":"After a less than stellar experience at iPic, I wasn't sure what to expect at Tanzy.  I received a coupon for a free appetizer and decided to check them out.  This is a beautiful space.  The decor and ambiance are upscale and swanky in a contemporary style.  I sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the football playoff games on one of the flat screen TVs.  The wine list is quite extensive and I ordered a nice glass of a cab/syrah blend.  For my appetizer I ordered the charcuterie plate.  This came out and had more than enough on it for two people to split.  Meats, cheeses, bread, olives and grapes.  Definitely a nice start to the meal.  I ordered the tagliatelle bolognese for my entree.  As someone else mentioned, the portions on this are huge!  What really stood out for me was the fresh pasta.  Not quite in the class of Marcellino's down the road but very good.  Also, I really enjoyed the service at the bar.  The female bartenders were friendly and very efficient.  I'm not sure when I'll be back for a movie at iPic but I'll be back at Tanzy again in the near future!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Tanzy on Thursday May 3rd, and it was great!  I heard they just changed the menu and wanted to give it a try.  The food, service and atmosphere were awesome.  We had the meatball appetizer, braised beef, and the desert tray at the table.  Everyone around us ordered off the desert tray, because it was so fun watching what people would order.  We all loved it and had a great evening!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR - We won a FB $100 gift cert for a Tanzy Happy Hour so we were excited to try it out (we loved the Salt Bar in same iPic complex). We came early at 4:30 (after hitting the Apple Store downstairs) and had an amazing Illegalito drink (actually 3!) sitting at the bar. Bartender and all staff really nice. Place starting filling up after 5ish with work crowd. By 6pm all bar seats taken. Fun people, great evening - big hangar doors open, later windows opened out onto Scottsdale Quarter common area. View of McDowell's wonderful - decor is beautiful. From 3-6 they put out a free artisan chef's table spread of olives, flatbread, berries, cheese and salami. So don't get the Mediteranean Appetizer Platter as it's mostly the same stuff (but better cheeses). We also ate Caeser Salads which were really good. Skip the Cream Brulee - the crunchy sprinkles were ok, the brulee just ok too. We'll be back. (book your iPic Gold Class reserved seats for a 6:45 movie, valet park, free popcorn, pillows/blankies, wait staff during previews - life doesn't get much better than this!)"}
{"text":"I hosted a large group here for clients and I would highly suggest looking for another restaurant if you're planning on doing the same thing.  I'll start with the one positive - the cheese and salami that was preset in the table prior to us arriving was outstanding.  Right after that positive experience the negatives soon took over.  They were understaffed and the staff that was working didn't meet expectations for a high end restaurant.  They didn't meet expectations for a low end restaurant.  It took 1 hour to have the salads served.  They did a poor job taking drink orders.  I had the chicken entree and the chicken was painful to eat since it was so dry.  I had to wash it down with water, which wasn't easy to access since they were understaffed.  I actually got up an poured it myself.  Finally, after speaking with the manager they brought out the desserts in a timely manner with a full staff which were begging for all night.  If you notice my reviews I never complain and I'd describe myself as low maintenance.  However, when hiring a restaurant to offer your clients a classy experience and you get a minor league experience I have to do my best to ensure that this doesn't happen again to future guests.  I do get the feeling that someone from the restaurant will read this and just blame the guests rather than making an attempt to figure out the issues that will eventually bankrupt the place."}
{"text":"To celebrate our anniversary, my boyfriend and I decided to go somewhere nice for dinner. We made a reservation and were seated as soon as we arrived. The booth they gave us was very spacious. Our server was very attentive and we continued to recieve great service throughout our dining experience. We were there about two hours so it's definitely a \"dining experience\".   For an appetizer, we had to try this table side mozzarella because we kept hearing such amazing things! The server who made it was really friendly and showed us \"newbies\" what it was all about. We got to choose what kind of salt we wanted and if we wanted oil. We chose the Hawaiian salts, which were great! I would definitely say the mozzarella was the hit of the night for us! For dinner, I ordered the swordfish and my boyfriend ordered the short rib. Both were very delicious and would recommend! We took the chocolate cake with raspberry sauce home with us to share. The cake was very rich but good! Overall, I would recommend Tanzy. For us, it was definitely an indulgence (food and money wise) but we enjoyed out time at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food and staff Not as good as it used to be. Sad because its  beautiful atmosphere and furnishings"}
{"text":"Short rib is yummy. Beet salad was good. Red velvet bread pudding was tasty and not too sweet. Fabulous service once you get seated.   Hostess was MIA when we arrived so I hunted down a server to find out if they were still serving.   Would definitely come again to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Dining at Tanzy solidified 2 litmus tests in my mind for determining if a restaurant is \"nice\" or mediocre (from perspective of someone who is dining savvy, defined as wouldn't eat at a chain restaurant): 1) a \"nice\" restaurant doesn't have tv's all over (with a sporting event), 2) if your steak is over-cooked and your new one arrives well after everyone at your table is already finished with their entree, they shouldn't charge you for it.  I laugh in hindsight realizing it was classified as an \"Italian\" restaurant: true it did have a pasta section on the large menu (reminiscent of cheesecake factory variety aiming to please all), and as my husband just suggested with a shrug \"it did have mozzarella\".   It's an upscale sportsbar with a menu for all, with some expensive items to appeal to the kierland commons conference folk who want to get a \"steak dinner\" on company's dime.  If u consider yourself a \"foodie\" (for lack of better over-used term), I don't think you'll be satisfied here. In general, I've only found really good food at Old town in scottsdale, the rest of it has a chainy feel. Yet again, at Tanzy, you are dining at a mall."}
{"text":"While the restaurant was empty, it was a Monday night and we were there to celebrate my partner's birthday so we didn't care. The ambiance, decor, cleanliness and music was perfect. Our waitress seriously catered to us, like we were family. So friendly, informative,  ready with suggestions and quick to get our drinks, then giving us time to relax, enjoy the view, look over the menu and decide what to eat. When our waitress, Audrey, came back to take our order, she suggested the chef's special and we ordered that, linguini w clams along w the sea scallops. Both dishes were exceptional. We started the meal w the homemade burratta and endeed it w a phenomenal chocolate treat w banana gelato. The dessert generously given to us, on the house. Everything was so good I had to write a post to help this establishment. A bit pricey, but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner to celebrate mother's day. All in all, it was a very nice experience. The restaurant has a beautiful interior, very elegant. The service was excellent with knowledgeable and accommodating staff.   Starting off, the complimentary bread with chimichurri sauce and prosciutto parma samples were delicious. We decided on the tableside pesto mozzarella for an app. It was the best part of the meal. Great flavor and a unique experience. As for the main dishes, they were a bit of a let down. I ordered the herb roasted chicken, which had a pretty basic flavor profile. Unfortunately the chicken was a bit dry. We also ordered the braised short ribs, which were very good and tender with a decent sized portion. Our third entree was Strozzapreti pasta dish with a red sauce. It tasted like any run of the mill pasta dish you could get at any Italian restaurant for a third of the price. For desert we shared their red velvet cake bread pudding, which was pretty yummy."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Tanzy. Not surprising as it's only been open a couple of weeks. Arriving, I admired the sharp decor, fire columns and warm, upscale feel to it. What I didn't admire was what seemed to be a group of hostesses who largely were confused by their job. A bit of arguing and the \"head\" hostess just finally telling the others to just shut up and let her think. Not good in front of customers.  We arrived about 15 minutes early and were asked to wait in the lounge. Very proper as we were early and when our reservation time we were promptly seated. I could see why the hostesses were confused once I was seated. My wife and I were seated at a two-top and on the other side of the wall from us was a booth that could have seated eight occupied by two people while the restaurant was on a wait. Strange.  We ordered the Crispy Brussel Sprouts (as came highly recommended in other Yelp reviews), Tagliatelle Bolognese and Scallops with Chantrelle Mushrooms. The service was great and our server was pleasant with just the right amount of conversation. The Crispy Brussel Sprouts were outstanding and I only wished I had another order! The Tagliatelle Bolognese was delicious as well and was so large that I didn't know how one person could finish it. Good thing we were sharing. The Scallops with Chantrelle Mushrooms were wonderful, well at least the scallops and mushrooms were. I couldn't eat much of the parsnip pear puree. The sweetness was a bit overkill for the meal as far as my taste was concerned.  The only thing that kept this review from being five stars was the music. It's right next door to the Salt lounge which has heavy techno beat music playing that permeates the entire restaurant making it feel like a club with dinner more than a restaurant with music. An upscale restaurant like this, you would expect something more appropriate. By the end of the dinner our nerves were just about frazzled.  While the food was great, for relatively the same price, we'll probably choose Ruth's Chris over Tanzy. It adds the fifth star for the same cost."}
{"text":"Nice brunch.  $15 includes Mimosa's, a small buffet bar with made-to-order pancakes, and assorted goodies.  Another $6 and you get your choice of some nice egg dishes."}
{"text":"Any restaurant can have a bad night and this was Tanzy's night. This was our first time dining here before a movie at iPic.. The hostess was very nice and asked if we were seeing a movie so she could inform the server of our schedule. The waiter was very nice and made suggestions on both the drink and dinner menu. The menu's all looked interesting and we were looking forward to the food. Unfortunately that's where it went down hill. Muscles appetizer was very disappointing and the waiter and Managment agreed it was unacceptable and brought out another one at no charge. The muscles were extremely small and in the first order one third of the order had closed shells. While we waited for our dinner selection a server came to our table to prepare an appetizer that we did not order, wrong table. Our entree came to the table 5 minutes before the movie was to begin so we asked for it to be served in the theatre. The GM brought the plate to us and unfortunately the stuffed shrimp was cold. While we waited for the dinner in the theatre the server took our drink order and during the move brought my wife her drink and never returned with mine. She didn't come back until it was time for the check. To top it off while we waited for our car the group next to us was talking about their experience and how three of the four dinners came out wrong. The Managment was very concerned and attentive but for the prices we paid for a movie and dinner this did not come close to my expectations nor did it for the people standing next to us waiting for our cars."}
{"text":"I expected a great meal for valentine's day.Made reservations a week in advance.  When we arrived we were sitted at a table in the bar area.. Not very romantic.  When we asked for tea they were out. As far as the the menu we not were impressed. We left there hungry.. Definitely  will not go back.. Was not worth the $80.00 bill.."}
{"text":"We had a blast and the food was off the chain, service was great thanks to our server Jill she made sure and the food plus drinks were perfect.!!!"}
{"text":"For a \"high end restaurant\" Tanzy fell short on several points.  First off the music was way too loud and I was sitting next to my wife and had to talk louder than normal for her to hear me.  The salad was good but had to rush to eat it because our entrees arrived before we were finished.  We both ordered the fillet which was cooked perfectly but the potatoes were almost raw and the three pieces of asparagus were too smoky tasting. Once again the desserts arrived before my wife was 3/4 finished with her entrée so the dessert sat for about ten minutes before we were ready to eat it.  The whole night we felt rushed to hurry and eat and leave."}
{"text":"Love it!  Great atmosphere, awesome drinks, and the house made mozzarella is one of my new favorite dishes of all time.  The bartenders do a great job, and are super friendly.  The only downside is that they don't have a happy hour, but they do have $3 drinks on Tuesdays.  Go and check it out!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Our server Jill was AMAZING!!! had great food & the atmosphere is beautiful!!"}
{"text":"I was here for The Breakfast Club.  Were were seated along the South window above the courtyard.  The dining room itself was really nice. Those in our group from the East Valley were delayed up to a half hour for road construction and they didn't bat an eyelash.  Service was spot on the whole time.  I had a prix fixe special of a chicken entree on fried gnocchi with Parmesan fries and a Tanzy salad.  It was all excellent.  Even in Scottsdale, if the salad had been $14 instead of included I thought it would be over priced."}
{"text":"An all around eclectic experience,  Tanzy's staff provided spectacular eats and shining service giving them five stars across the board.  Coop was very down to earth, hospitable, and exhumed a heir of confidence  that allowed for my husband and I to have a comfortable evening; feeling that we were in good hands.  Not to forget the fresh mozz, prosciutto, and spiced fig paired with volcanic black salt and EVOO followed by two very delectable, and decently portioned entrees. Needless to say, my husband and I left Tanzy with two very happy palates.  The prices are what one would expect from a four star establishment,  but it is well worth it, especially for the overall quality that is received."}
{"text":"For August Breakfast Club the place picked was Tanzy, I for one was pretty excited about it! I didn't even know they were opened for bunch so when I got a look at the bunch menu I knew I was sold!  Tanzy does offer a prix fixe bunch menu for $22 that comes with a lot of options, but they also have a breakfast menu too. After checking out both menus I knew what I wanted.   I went with the traditional eggs benedict. It was the perfect dish, with the right amount of hollandaise sauce; I just love that golden yellow tangy sauce! Yum! The eggs were cooked perfectly, the smoked Canadian ham was tender and moist, not dry and the English muffin was cooked perfectly too, firm and yet able to be cut when taking bite.  This was a great dish, can't wait to come back and try it again! The only down side to this breakfast was I wasn't able to get a order of the crispy Brussels sprouts, as it was too early to order them.   Service was great; the restaurant is an opened lay out and nice, it even has great views of the valley. If you are in the area, regardless if it's for breakfast or dinner, give Tanzy a try! And if it's for dinner, do the crispy Brussels sprouts, man they are delish!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, service and atmosphere! Great wine selection as well.  Will be back as soon as I'm in the area again.   Well done Tanzy!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been frequenting Tanzy for Sunday brunch for the last couple of years. We tend to come in every other week, but more often during football season as the bartenders are very accommodating in tuning into the game you would like to watch. The brunch menu is fairly extensive and we typically enjoy the brown sugar spiced bacon as our appetizer. Some of the entrées I would recommend would be the build your own omelet, blueberry pancakes and the 10oz Tanzy burger. With the recent addition of the Social Hour menu, more sharable options are now available and they have added a 5oz black and blue burger which is fantastic and lighter on the waistband then its 10oz brunch counterpart.  Now to be fair there are many brunch destinations in Scottsdale and North Phoenix, but what makes Tanzy truly special is the staff. With so many restaurants available, what makes any restaurant worth frequenting these days is the staff members you enjoy interacting with and the exceptional service they provide. With that being said, Shay has been one of our favorite bartenders. She remembered us from our first brunch experience with her and knew us by name on our next meeting. She is always quick with a smile when she sees us come in and greets us with enthusiasm. She genuinely seems to enjoy her work and is a pleasure to dine with. We will continue to highly recommend Tanzy to our friends and family as not only because of the wonderful brunch options, but as a place where providing personal service and attention to your customers still means something."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group of people, there were 13 of us total. We originally were planning on going to True Food- it would have have been a 90 min wait there so that's how we ended up at Tanzy. Tanzy was able to seat us right away which was great!   The decor and ambience of the establishment is modern and upscale. But let's talk about what's really important-  the food!  My friend and I shared the lobster salad and pasta with mushrooms and were we glad we did cause the portions were quite generous!  By sharing, we were able to enjoy two different dishes at the just right portions.  The lobster salad was simply delicious with a very light dressing that gave just the right amount of flavoring to the dish. And there were plenty of lobster pieces in the salad too.  The pasta with mushroom dish was also delicious. I should be more honest- it was scrumlicious!!!!  Generally with this type of pasta dishes, there's usually a heavy sauce to give the pasta flavor or else the pasta is flavorless. Not with this dish. The pasta was cooked perfectly and cooked with just the right amount of sauce without it being heavy. I'm not sure how the chef got the flavor to stick to the pasta. Needless to say, I ate every last piece of pasta on my plate! I sneaked a peek at the other dishes, they all looked delicious and well presented.  Service was excellent. And they will split the shared dishes for you before bringing the entrees out to your table.  I went in there with no expectations and left a very happy costumer and am looking forward to going back to try out the other entrees!"}
{"text":"Great place for drinks awesome happy hour great bar service.  I don't understand why it takes so long to get something so simple but the atmosphere is spectacular. I'll still come back but they really need to revamp the menu and fix the service.  If Tanzy had food and service like AZ88 it would be a gold mine."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the atmosphere, and service was fast and the staff knowledgeable. If only there was a movie theater next door where I could go watch a movie after dinner... Oh wait, there is!! I'll for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! 4 mimosas for $10.. Can't beat that! Food was great... I had the poached eggs and my friend had an omelette. The fruit that was served was very fresh. The poached eggs had a truffle sauce and a side of artichokes with prosciutto! Delish!! I will be coming back for brunch and I need to try dinner!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  This is a great place to have lunch or happy hour drinks.  It's located at the Scottsdale Quarter right next to a very nice iPic movie theater, so it's convenient for pre/post movie cocktails as well.  Lunch is my favorite time to come.  The Prosciutto di Parma Ciabatta and the Turkey Panini are two of my favorite dishes.  They're both only $10 ea and comes with Parmesan Fries, which are addicting...yum!  The lunch crowd here is relatively light for Scottsdale, which means you'll get in/out pretty fast.  Service here is always very good.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Reservation was made for 4 of us for a birthday celebration. No reservation was needed! Lounge was packed, restaurant not so much. This was our first and last time here. Questioned a particular vodka, server stated not available and never heard of it, of course after she served our drinks, she appeared with the vodka in hand, humbled. We began with the tableside mozzarella to share, was pretty decent, however, before we were 1/2 through, our entrees appeared. Seriously? What happened to dining? Not like they needed the table for the next party, plenty were available, 6:30pm reservation and we were out by 7:45pm. Has anyone ever seen rolled monkfish? Looked like two turds on my plate, had to use a knife to cut so tough and chewy, no I didn't send it back, not worth it. Monkfish is to be silky and smooth, almost like halibut. How about calamari served with capers? That's a first for us. Tuna Tartare? Tasteless. I will say the Tiramasu that the birthday boy ordered was ok and nice touch to include it. Don't waste your time or your money!"}
{"text":"We took my husband and father out for brunch on Fathers day. We were seated right away which was great. We requested the back room and thats where we were seated. there wasnt a lot of choices for brunch so we are hoping to come back on a regular night to order from the main menu. it seemed like the food did take a while to come out and it was just 4 adults and a child eating. it was pretty good just wish there were more choices."}
{"text":"Best Italian diner ever. Fine dining but without the cost. I found the menu items very reasonably priced considering the other fine dining restaurants I've been to. Also the customer service is phenomenal. Tyne server Josh was beyond accommodating and anticipated our needs perfectly what a great server! Also the manager Jarome stopped by our table numerous times to ensure our experience was beyond enjoyable. Thank you to the entire Tanzy team and great food!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Tanzy on Easter Sunday. I had made us reservations and found that was the right way to go! The place is beautiful but hard to find at Scottsdale Quarters. Park in one of the garages available or valet park and walk. The restaurant is on the second level next to Ipic studios. Take the escalator or elevator upstairs.  They can accommodate large groups or an intimate meal for two. We went for the lunch box breakfast option at $19.99 a person.  I had the eggs Benedict with salmon and asparagus and hubby chose the omelet option. With a side of the bacon \"flight\" which is extra it was a wonderful meal. The make it yourself Bloody Mary bar was nice as part of the meal. Our waiter Adrian was busy but attentive and our interactions with the Easter bunny were fun. A special occasion place but a great way to have a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Awesome steak salad with delicious ripe vine tomatoes!  I really like the big booths and comfortable modern decor. It also has a great bar! This place is upstairs located next to the IPic Theater. We would have never tried it, but we were told that it would be a 45 min wait at True Food downstairs so we decided to check it out!  The dinner menu looked great, so we will have to check that out another time. I am glad we came here and I would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Are here last night. Staff is super friendly and on top of it!! They comp'd our mozzarella appetizer for being a little bit late. It wasn't that delayed so it was very nice of them to do. I highly recommend getting one of the fresh table side mozzarella appetizers!  So good with the pink Himalayan salt!! For entree I had the Branzino...it was perfect."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service! Happy hour only goes till 6 though which kind of sucks."}
{"text":"I've been here many times for a working lunch. They have free wifi, and booths near the window have views outside so it can be a relaxing, quiet place to get work done. For food, I usually get either the smoked turkey or the CBLT sandwich, which have always been pretty good. The staff has always been friendly and attentive. The happy hour wine is a great deal, and a very generous pour! Its located next to the iPic, so you can grab dinner before heading in to see a movie."}
{"text":"So let me get this straight...you have reverse Happy Hour that starts at 10pm and your hostess locks the door and starts her clean up at 1015pm? There was hardly anyone in the bar except for friends of the wait staff and bar tender in which they were all sitting over with them. Now I know it wasn't busy, but a little unprofessional. How about the management gets with the picture and starts to do things to get new life into that place before they have to close their doors. The reverse Happy Hour specials were ok...but they need to include all their signature cocktails instead of just three."}
{"text":"I went with a small group of people Sunday evening to Tanzy; we figured we'd give it a try. Great ambiance; we felt like we were in a Las Vegas restaurant. The server Isaiah waited on us. Cordial, professional, yet still had a friendly approach that made us feel at home. The shrimp was fantastic. Beyond fantastic. The scallops were some of the best scallops we've had. I thought my bolognese was a bit heavy on the rosemary side, my friends disagreed. But regardless, Isaiah was quick to offer me a replacement entree. The attention we received by our server, along with delicious food, will certainly get us coming back here again. Ask for Isaiah. I just met him Sunday and already I feel like I know who to request when I return. He won't steer you wrong."}
{"text":"Went there a couple of days ago. Caprese was great! Wife got the ravioli, and didn't care for it. I had the ribeye, and was over cooked. $48 for what is basically an Applebee's steak. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Wowwwww.... from Top to flop and back to absolutely TOP..  And the absolut TOP parts that's ot how I/ we knew and experienced Tanzy in the past and now again. First of all, your costumer service was amazing and took my/ our complaint very serious. Super management!!! Now, after quite a while we returned to your place, on a Saturday evening...  And to make it short, we had the full amazing experience what your place is famous for... nice service and great food. Everything was on point. We ordered the Ribeye steak and Braised Pork Shoulder... both main dishes were extremely tasty, and just to die for. For starter we ordered the grilled calamari: super  soft, great taste, just wonderful. At the end it was a fantastic dinner experience. Thanks for everything... and YES we are coming back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant.  Loved the table side mozzarella/pesto. Such a great idea.  Staff was attentive and nice. Drinks.......yum."}
{"text":"Good food but so loud you can't talk so perhaps it's just for blind dates. Table side mozz is fun but takes 20-25 minutes. Interesting list but staff isn't trained on it. Had a French Orin swift we stumbled on that  was good - definitely not a relaxing quiet Italian dinner place.  My ears hurt!  Yet food was good"}
{"text":"Great and classy place!! Located on 2nd floor of Sdale Quarter (adjacent to iPic). NOTE: park in the garage by Brio, or valet - I believe Tanzy validates parking.  I had heard rave reviews of Tanzy, but had my own personal bias w/the name. You see, I was raised on a farm in SW Washington and \"tansy\" was a menacing weed that was cursed under one's breath in the spring. I personally thought the weed was quite charming (beautiful, yellow flowers)...but my grandparents thought differently.  Tanzy didn't disappoint! It was late afternoon so the staff rolled back the walls and the lounge area was completely al fresco. Nice breeze on the tropical sofas while watching the tops of the palms sway in the wind. Felt like I was on a damn vacation.  I had a cucumber-lime martini (delish, but a tad on sweet side) and their calamari. OMG! Soooo good! My friend had their fries and they were quite impressive also - unique tasting and love that they were put in like a little, silver \"fry basket\". Nice touch!!  Service was impeccable and attentive. Tanzy, you won my heart and have changed up my personal bias - thank you!!"}
{"text":"The drink selection is amazing...I feel like im in new york. Service is off the charts. Staff is so accommodating.  The food phenomenal. Im in love New York!!!!!"}
{"text":"The jaz duo in the bar was delightfull  Service team was timely, professional and knowledgable  Gluten free options were good  in a word \"Enjoyable\""}
{"text":"Amazing new menu !! Filet was good but the flat skirt steak was one of the best juiciest steak I have ever experienced!! Well done Tandy  See you again soon"}
{"text":"Overpriced drinks and an appetizer costs up $55. Seriously. The place is cool, hence the 3 stars. The door is like something out of a movie and the glass and lighting are really neat. I say you save this for a date when you wont be paying. I was not on that at the time. The bartender was okay, kept getting into conversations with other staff that lasted too long. Our drinks, while way too expensive, were unique and delicious."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Tanzy twice now. The first experience was for their prix fix Valentine menu which was broken into four courses.  The first course was a choice of parma tasting or caprese. My husband and I both ordered the parma tasting. This consisted of 3 meats - prosciutto, capicola and one other. There were also three sauces to try. Overall, I wasn't very impressed with this and didn't finish it.   The second course was a choice of lobster bisque or Tanzy house salad. My husband and I both chose the lobster bisque. It was delicious and one of the better bisques we've had. (My husband is a huge fan of lobster bisque and gets it at most restaurants.) There were large chunks of lobster in it, which was a treat.   The main course was a choice of filet mignon, lobster tail, pan-seared seabass or a surf and turf (1/2 lobster tail and filet mignon). My husband and I both ordered the surf and turf. Both of our filets were cooked perfectly medium rare. The side of mashed potatoes was good, but nothing to write home about. The lobster on the other hand was very tasty.   The dessert was a choice of red velvet bread pudding, a chocolate torte, or a date cake. My husband ordered the bread pudding and I ordered the chocolate torte. The bread pudding was amazing. Super tender and flavorful. I would definitely order this again. The chocolate torte was just okay. I really wish I ordered the bread pudding instead.   Overall, we enjoyed being able to sample many menu items and would give this experience four stars.  Our second experience was for lunch. We came on a Sunday around brunch time and had to decide if we wanted breakfast or lunch. Their breakfast sounded good and everyone around us had delicious looking entrees. However, we opted for lunch. I ordered the club and my husband went with the cheeseburger.   My club was ridiculous and I had to deconstruct it and put it back together before I could actually eat it. First, it had three layers of bread. I removed one layer and also took out the fried egg. (Who puts fried egg on a club?) The egg by itself was tasty but I didn't want it on my club. Next, I had to rearrange the avocado so that it made a layer instead of just sitting in one clump. Then, I had to remove the iceberg lettuce because that overpowered the sandwich. (Again, iceberg? Romaine would have been much better and more appreciated.) Then to top it all off, the turkey was dry. The only good thing about my meal was the parmesan fries.  My husband's burger looked delicious but was a large disappointment. The meat itself was extremely flavorless and the bacon was chewy. The bun was extremely large and after a while, my husband just gave up and took the bun off and ate the burger with a fork/knife. Again, the only good thing about the meal was the parmesan fries.  Overall, it wasn't a good lunch and I would give this experience two stars. Add the two experiences together and it evens out to three stars. However, I'm not sure if we'll be back."}
{"text":"I want to like Tanzy for more than what it is. The restaurant has a great vibe. It's a place where you want to have a date, or a get-together with friends, or a fabulous bite after shopping or pre-movie because of how the place looks. However, the food is a let-down. It is an extremely basic menu with a pricey upcharge. I've eaten at Tanzy several times and the only thing on the menu that kept me going was the calamari starter. However, they changed the dish and it fails to compare.  It was divine before, and now it is a basic dish. I do have to give it kudos on customer service. That has always been up to snuff. The final verdict for this place: A great place to have a drink."}
{"text":"The last few times I have been to Tanzy's things have been welllll not good... not good at all. You have this beautiful space adjacent to Ipic theatre, which is a high end movie theatre for those not in the know. I usually grab a drink or two or a meal before a movie here but after the last few visits never again.  Service is always spotty (yesterday was no exception, the only saving grace was a nice Midwest fellow who went out of his way to give us a good experience). As I was sitting at the bar, I looked up at the shelves and kinda lost my appetite when I noticed the insane amount of dust on the bottles on the shelves and really the shelves themselves, It made me wonder if it's that dusty and dirty in the front of the house, what does the back of the house look like?  Food was terrible, French onion soup was flavorless and sickeningly sweet and there was hardly any cheese... French Onion soup is all about the cheese and rich robust flavors. Don't even get me started on the calamari, the texture of it was almost like chewing on cardboard paper, the sauce that the calamari is served on was delicious though. For a few cocktails and a couple bad appetizers that put me out $57.00 plus tip it makes me feel like I was robbed."}
{"text":"We checked this place out while in the area. The food was good, and there was some live jazz. I had the meatballs and Kale salad (avoiding carbs). I'd go back and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Food is great, bartenders have been always understanding and pour well, I have never had an issue with the waitstaff or food. I have been to this restaurant more than 15 times since moving to Scottsdale 2 years ago."}
{"text":"It's hard to give this place two stars, because I really like the atmosphere here. However, the service was lacking and has been for quite some time now. I don't get to go out much during the week, so I always count on a good meal and good service when going out during the weekend with a group of friends. The past few times I've been here, I've been more than disappointed with the service, despite the consistent chances I've given this place. Our server said \"no\" or \"I don't believe so\" or \"I will have to check to see if we still have that available\" or \"I think we are out\"- it was absolutely horrible!! She didn't know anything. On top of that, our food came out all at random times, in no order, over an HOUR and we ordered everything at the same time. These were just simple appetizers! I'm sad to say this because I really believe this place has so much potential with its location- but with the continuous lack of service I've received over time, I will not be back."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Tanzy tonight for happy hour. Little did we know that it was ladies night at Tanzy. We were informed when we arrived that ladies night meant that we received half off of the happy hour menu. I'm surprised they wouldn't gladly advertise this on their website as the restaurant was slow the duration of the time we were there (other than the private party).   We ordered two cocktails, 4 glasses of wine and two appetizers for $27. It was a phenomenal deal considering their normal prices and the amount of food and drinks that we received. We ordered the Ratatouille pizza and it was great!  We would highly recommend this dish.   A few gripes that we had though: the chips that came with the quinoa & spinach dip were way under done. The chips were almost chewy. It ruined the dip for us. The service was also pretty slow. We sat at the bar. There were two bartenders with only about 8-10 people at the bar for the entire 2.5 hours that we were there. They did have a private party going on so maybe they should've staffed up behind the bar.   Of course we were very happy with the pricing but I would not come back during a non happy hour for the lower level of service with higher prices."}
{"text":"An amazing experience.  The location is great, atmosphere is incredible, friendly employees and our group of 9 were very impressed with the food.  The halibut special was one of the best I have ever had.  Great for a romantic night out or for a group.  I will be returning, it was hard to choose what to order on the menu because it all looked good."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I was had while dining here.  When I received the bill the wrong drinks were on there which were almost $10 more than what I had ordered and the list price on the menu for another was less than the bill price.    This place feels like it is run by someone whose dream was to run a restaurant but has no idea what they are doing.  If you are going to charge the prices you do then the service needs to reflect that.  After speaking to 3 different people we finally received drinks.  We watched 3 other tables that had been seated after us receive their appetizers before receiving ours.  Our waitress actually came over and asked us if we had received it yet as if we were in charge of the situation!!!  The food is meh.  They have a hysterical dessert cart... why??????  This is so awkward.  Just give me my dessert, clearly your staff are overwhelmed why are they also pastry chefs and need to make a show of it?  On top of this its an Italian restaurant with NO TIRAMISU.  The shame!  Trust the reviews on Yelp that the service here is consistently horrible and stay home and order pizza!"}
{"text":"The service was great! But the food was less than \"okay\". Meatballs tasted like chef boyardee, the fries were crumbs, and the calamari was cold. Not a soul in sight on a Saturday night. Past its prime and to spend over $100 just to hear that the kitchen shared its menus with a movie theater? Go to Olive Garden for a better time."}
{"text":"Karen reached out to me with a post on Yelp, I forwarded her my phone and email address as she requested.  Sad to say that she never contacted or reached out to me.  Sad to say, I'll be finding another place for my corporate events and a new place to host friends/family."}
{"text":"This is a really simple one,  the food was better than expected.  Jay our server was great and took care of business and left us alone until needed.   Ask for Jay! I had the Caesar salad with lemon dressing and guest had linguini with shrimp which was at the perfect temperature and so yummy,  I forgot to take picture. :-)  Perfect night out and walk around downtown.  ALSO REMEMBER YOU CAN GET VALET RECEIPT VALIDATED."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some drinks around the fire! I recently discovered Tanzy, and I wish I had been going here all along! Great late night food menu as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great evening at Tanzy on New Years Eve.  The restaurant is beautiful with a cool, sophisticated vibe.  The service and food were excellent.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Met a friend here yesterday before a movie.  I actually arrived first, around 5:50 pm, told the bartender I was waiting for a friend who was going to join me at a 6:15 pm movie and asked if I could order the Table-side Mozzarella For Two to take with us.  He said there wouldn't be enough time to order the app, but that we could order apps on the happy hour menu list and take those, so I chose the calamari and the meatballs, which were $8 each.  The calamari smelled fishy (not the sea-fresh scent) and had terrible texture, as if it was undercooked. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tanzy-scottsdale?start=100&select=Kdc4C3svJf6R7QmXrGo5ZQ#Kdc4C3svJf6R7QmXrGo5ZQ  The meatballs were good, albeit on the smallish side**, with a nice dollop of ricotta cheese, but the dish wasn't accompanied by any crostini, unlike my previous orders, which were admittedly a year, or more ago. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tanzy-scottsdale?start=100&select=nNFXqb2B8vN8envJcgRl7g#nNFXqb2B8vN8envJcgRl7gI  I asked for a little bread, but didn't have time to wait for it as we had to leave for the movie.    Don't know if I'd order the meatballs again, especially since the crostini were omitted, but my friend and I will be back to try the Mozzarella for two soon.  **This is what the meatball crostini app looked like in March 2013! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tanzy-scottsdale?select=9aiYhoNUaF_nJWOkYu-yjg#9aiYhoNUaF_nJWOkYu-yjg  #740"}
{"text":"Gorgeous!!!  Food- eh, its OK ...as weird as it is to say this.. try the Brussels sprouts  Bar- Tom the bartender makes this place worth going to all by himself. hes over the top fun!! Good drinks fast!   I have been here several times and even though I didn't care for i at first they seem to be improving all of the things that seem to be off. Now even offering a complementary hummus bar during happy hour( which was not previously offered)"}
{"text":"Great spot for a first date! Valet the slab and walk on up, great drink selection and very inviting appetizers.  The staff is very friendly, get a little toasted here and head on home, it's game over! This place is a must try."}
{"text":"Had a lovely Mommies Night Out here recently. A great venue for sharing some wine (recommend the NZ Sauvignon Blanc) and some delicious appetizers! The warm mozzarella was amazing ... love how it is prepared right in front of you. The atmosphere was nice and cozy, the music was good and at a level that allowed you to still be able to talk to one another and the service was wonderful."}
{"text":"This restaurant always has the most amazing staff! I love love love the fresh table side mozzarella , the bruschetta board teeming with fresh berries, marcona almonds, a varied selection of cheese, fig spread and other seasonal accoutrements. It's so fun to have a cocktail before the movie , a few appetizers and if you don't finish either you can bring it to the theater with you!"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with my hubby last weekend as part of the fabulous Monica O.'s monthly breakfast club. This is probably one of the more expensive breakfasts we have had as a group but it was also in one of the nicer establishments. Scottsdale Quarter is a pretty high brow shopping center and Tanzy lives up to this locale. Lots of dark wood, gorgeous stone and metal finishes, and lovely chandeliers. It is a pretty nice looking place.  To eat, I had a spinach omelette which was cooked perfectly. I also had the gouda hash browns which weren't as delicious as I thought they would be. I am not really sure what was off about them but I think I preferred the rosemary potatoes that came with my husband's meal. He ordered the steak and eggs since he loves getting that at most breakfast places. At Tanzy instead of a typical breakfast strip steak the meal included filet which is a great cut of meat but there just wasn't enough of it. Also, even though the description mentioned English muffins it did not specify that it would be served up like a McMuffin sandwich. He wasn't too thrilled about that. The most cost efficient part of the meal was their great deal on 4 mimosas for $10. They were mostly juice but still tasted great. You will definitely want to take advantage of this, especially in light of the fact that THEY CHARGE $5 FOR A GLASS OF SODA. The server never came by to give my husband a refill so that was pretty annoying to pay that much for a single glass of soda.  I might stop in here for brunch again if I were going to see a movie at ipic (which we did) but I wouldn't drive out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Totally a cool place wish San Fran had a place like this. The food was fresh reasonable we shared a bottle mascoto really a great bottle . We had the calamari grilled with Caesar salad then we shared a meal and of course dessert. The service was amazing. The atmosphere breath taking , the whole package was breath taking. This area is really cute"}
{"text":"Absolutely, gorgeous set up. Meet some friends for happy hour.  Tuesday is one cent martinis! Three to choose from. Jeannie tried the pineapple-jalapeño and the citrus martini. She enjoyed the citrus one the most, but did like the pin-jal one also.  I had a couple of $4 Stellas.  Had great service and look forward to a return visit. Think they have something called wine down Wednesdays , where they have 1/2 off on bottles and wine reps doing tastings...need to check it out!"}
{"text":"By far, the best restaurant in Scottsdale Quarter and an amazing place for special events."}
{"text":"Stopped by for my first time for a last minute date night with my boyfriend yesterday and the food was phenomenal! We were greeted by the manager, Dayna. She was so sweet and extremely welcoming. Our server, Abigail was very knowledgeable of the menu. I was unsure of what to order on the menu so she helped me out and I ended up getting the Tuscan Kale salad with grilled salmon and my boyfriend got the gulf shrimp and grits.... YUM! The atmosphere was so relaxing, and the employees are so attentive. It's also such a cool place to eat at before you catch a movie, only because it's also attached to iPic theaters! Be sure to ask for Abigail or Dayna when you come in! They'll make it worth your time. :)"}
{"text":"Went to Tanzy for birthday dinner last Saturday and it was amazing! The fresh table order mozzarella was the appetizer of choice for everyone in our party. Chef Press and his crew brought out a surprise pasta carbonara course and there is no way I can recreate that at home.. we muscled our way through our main course but still had room for dessert! Thank you to Chef Press and his front and back of the house team!"}
{"text":"Such a great place to hang out...bartenders are all fabulous. Haven't tried food there, but the atmosphere is fantastic and so are the drinks!"}
{"text":"Everything here is fantastic.  The atmosphere leaves nothing to be desired, the wine list is amazing, and the food?  Yum!  I'm especially partial to the tableside mozzarella and have brought many friends with me to try it."}
{"text":"For a restaurant to have a specific prix fixe menu on thanksgiving that is taking reservations I would have expected a little more organization. We waited 10-15 mins before getting seated with reservations.  We waited another 10-12 minutes before we even got greeted at our table. Once we ordered drinks they sat at the bar for another 10-15 minutes. We never got waters, garnishes in drinks (even after being told they'd come), never got second round of drinks had to walk to the bar to ask for them. The time between courses was unbelievably long. The food was cold.  It was VERY disappointing for a $45/pp menu. Especially after being told everything was made in a huge batch but yet we still waited a considerable amount of time. I understand that it is a holiday but for a restaurant to have a knowledge of number of guests and prix fixe the service and quality was terrible."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings tonight...The food was excellent, as usual.  I was VERY dissapointed that the only dairy free desert was sorbet.  The waiters were quite confused all night...One started to do a mozarella presentation.  We had to stop him to say we didn't order that.  Someone dropped a plate of short ribs on a table...Sorry but we didn't order that either!  Hubby started eating his desert only to realize it was the wrong one.  Sorry Tanzy, tonight just wasn't your night, ours neither! This visit was not typical, maybe because it was friday the 13th and Valentine's weekend.  The staff were very nice but extremely confused! The food was delicious."}
{"text":"Had the distinct pleasure of having dinner here tonight. Although we live in Scottsdale, my husband and I are frequent travelers and  have dined out in restaurants throughout the United States. Our waiter, Adrian, was the best waiter we've ever had.  Service was phenomenal, as well as his knowledge of the food/desserts.  His warm and gracious personality and attention to detail was outstanding.  The food was excellent (including the table side mozzarella) and the wait time between appetizers and the meal was excellent. We will definitely return here soon. Thank you, Tanzy and staff, for a great evening."}
{"text":"Very beautiful space. Also located close to shops which is nice. We came during happy hour, where prices were pretty reasonable. I found it interesting that the feel is very lounge like, lots of couches and comfortable furniture. We were greeted right away, and the person taking care of us did a great job of managing our large group. The appetizers here were very good, we tried several. Check this place out for a chill vibe and great service."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and haven't been impressed. The food is over priced and just ok. The last time we had dinner here the service was terrible and our server gave us the impression she's rather be someplace else. We won't be returning and certainly wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"We used to go there a lot on Tuesday for HH and did so tonight before a movie and the waiter/bartender was horrible! We asked about HH specials and he just gave us a blank stare so we just said we'd have the house wines, which he neglected to tell us one wasn't on special, that the house wine was 10 bucks. Just rude! No one was friendly there and the food has never really been great. I rather eat at ipic! Of course they don't care about reviews so think about going to another place in the area before this one. We never see anyone there and they always act like they are sooo busy   Updated!!! The Manager Peter said for us to come back in and he gave us our meal and drinks complimentary and everything was great and he even let us order off iPic menu since we didn't feel like breakfast. Everyone was super friendly and welcoming! Great stop before a movie. They've redone the place and it looks beautiful!"}
{"text":"I came here to eat while waiting for my showtime at the Scottsdale IPIC Theater. It is a little on the pricey side but I enjoyed it. I had a rib eye sandwich and it was very good. It was lunch time and it was not very crowded on a Tuesday. The service was great and the waiter took the time to explain which were his favorites and why they were his favorites. He cared about us and it made us feel welcomed. I will definitely try this place again when in the area."}
{"text":"Visited the first day it opened and still a repeat customer. Ask for the cucumber jalapeno martini (secret menu item me and the bartender know)."}
{"text":"Great cocktails and ambience! Good date spot!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just came home from my birthday dinner at Tanzy.  Our server, Heidi, took an excellent care of us.  Perfect ambiance, tasteful decor, and delightful entrees.  We are so pleased to find such a gem in our neighborhood.  We plan to return soon with our friends and family!!"}
{"text":"Service terrible. Was at this restaurant for 2 hours waiting and waiting for brunch. Not busy at all either.  Tarimasu was soggy. Food was decent.  Don't sit in the bar. Learned a lesson here"}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to check out Tanzy for a while now, after hearing about the beautiful decor and awesome cocktails.  I likes me an awesome cocktail in beautiful surroundings in the springtime.  With those things in mind, I decided a Wednesday Happy Hour would be a good time for the first visit; knowing that Tanzy doesn't really have Happy Hour specials, and OK with that in order to get a well crafted cocktail and equivalent bites to go with.  They were almost empty at that hour, and there must've been 20+ people working the place.  I assume prepping for an evening rush(?).  We ended up with two servers competing for our table who, when they took their passive-aggressive discussion four feet away, were still very audible to us.  I found myself hoping for a full-on catfight as surprise entertainment for the evening.  But, alas, the bigger and louder of the two won out.  This aggressive tone turned out to be a common theme throughout our visit - in how everything was described as nothing short of Nirvana, in how a full entree was pushed on us when we only asked about the side that came with the entree, in being informed that the portions of a $28 short rib entree wouldn't be enough for two of us to share, in the smiles so unnaturally big they looked like they hurt, in how the server described the restaurant's concept as \"very Scottsdale\".  Hark - do I smell desperation?  Now, that's something we long-time Phoenix/Scottsdale residents know well as we see restaurants come and go in the blink of an eye.  My dining partner insited we place bets right then and there on how long Tanzy will be around.  Did I enjoy my experience at Tanzy?  Well, no, because of what I think was just an off night for service, and because the cocktails and food we ordered didn't measure up to the hype.  I'll for sure give them another chance - it truly is a beautiful restaurant and does appear to have professional, very hard working people that can make whatever adjustments are needed - if they are needed.  (My opinion might just be that - my opinion alone)  We can never have too many great places in Scottsdale, and I sincerely hope Tanzy is one of those great places that makes it here.  To get me on board, it's just going to need to tone down the attitude."}
{"text":"Today I got to experience brunch at Tanzy.. I've been here before for happy hour.. we started our day with mimosas (yum!).. they have a short but not simple brunch menu..   I had the poached egg, mascarpone polenta, short ribs & kale w/bacon. The polenta was creamy goodness, paired beautifully with the slow cooked tender short ribs and the caramalized goodness of the kale &bacon.   My gf got the steak & eggs.. it came with potatoes & toast..   Since we weren't ready to go and they weren't serving dessert yet.. we split the monkey bread and had coffees with Baileys .. the monkey bread was like a crusty muffin (weird) until you break it up into pieces and pour chocolate sauce all over it .. that's how it's meant to be enjoyed!!   Overall great experience even with a new waitress in training the bartender did his best to get around to make sure we didn't need anything else .."}
{"text":"We have been here twice as part of a large group. (14-20 people) and we have had excellent service. they are always prepared and assign multiple servers to our table. The food was excellent, and the tableside mozzarella with truffle oil was also amazing. We will definitely be using this place for future dinners. We are so impressed with the crew at Tanzy!"}
{"text":"Crab cake was so tiny and super salty.. I wanted eat them because it was $16 but too salty to eat them. Folk was dirty and drink was not worth of $13.. it used to be nice restaurant but quality went down but price is still high."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst experiences I have had at any restaurant and I didn't even get to eat the food. We decide to eat at the bar and the hostess does not even give us menus, because she is running around the whole restaurant when there is a line waiting to be seated. Then I grab two menus by myself and don't get greeted for 15 minutes then 5 minutes later we get waters , then we wait another five minutes until we decide to leave . It is such a shame that such a beautiful restaurant is so understaffed . This is not the first time I heard about this happening , but I wanted to make my own opinion , and it was unfortunate that a space this huge had one hostess , one manager , one bartender , and five servers at 6 o clock on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"We wanted to spend the day walking outside in a great environment and do some shopping. We wanted to end the day with a little romantic flair and Tanzy delivered.  Tanzy is the restaurant on the second floor of the Scottsdale quarter across from Tru Food. It is connected to the iPic theater. We had a couple of drinks which were all excellent, but the main attraction is the location and ambiance. With one wall open, couches jutting out from inside, and a smokeless fire place this bar oozes a great atmosphere to take someone special.   On the con side, the back to some of the couches are not very comfortable if one does not enlist the help of some of the throw pillows on a neighboring couches. Tanzy please invest some capital into couch cushion technology! All in all a great experience. Be Prepared to pay at least 10 dollars for mixed drinks."}
{"text":"1st of all, this is not an Italian restaurant. Theres very few pasta dishes available. 2nd of all, we went to the grand reopening the other night, and it was fabulous. They had a lot of people staffed and everything went really smoothly. So we decided to come back tonight. Big mistake. Such a Big mistake that we will never ever be back. 1st of all, we made a reservation 3 days ago for 7:00 p.m. tonight. The hostess proceeds to rudely tell us that we had to wait half an hour for a table because there's other people waiting besides us. Mind you, the restaurant was half empty. Then we had to wait an hour and a 1/2 for our food. Yes you heard me right. As we were getting ready to walk out of the restaurant, the manager comes up to us and assures us that the food will be right out. Most of the food was undercooked and cold, and my pasta dish was served on a little side dish and they managed to charge me $13 for it. This place is such a joke. They Have no idea what they're doing or what's going on here. Very very understaffed and very unprofessional."}
{"text":"The tableside mozzarella was delish.  I had the short rib and my husband had the sea bass - both were outstanding!  The pan fried gnocci was so tasty - never had it served that way before.  Even though we were stuffed we couldn't resist trying the red velvet bread pudding - glad we did!!!  Will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"The bar area is extremely lovely here. If you go for happy hour they have a mini buffet set up with tapas that im pretty sure would fill you up on its own. Every part of the lounging area was beautiful and I would say perfect for a date, girls night, or even just a lonesome venture (which I probably would never do).   A group of girls came here for restaurant week and they had the table set up for us before we arrived. We did lounge at the bar to get a few drinks in before dinner which they happily accommodated. The restaurant menu meals were really good. Just note that the artichokes are fried and the calamari is not. There were a few of us who thought the opposite and ordered accordingly. I would have to say though, the calamari was realllly delicious and i would go back just to eat it again. The artichokes were also good but the amount they gave us (large portions) was way more than enough.   Just to keep things short. My meal was awesome. The restaurant week menu included a wine pairing option so i opted for it just to be adventurous. THE best decision of the night.   I would definitely recommend going for restaurant week..or just any week"}
{"text":"The good: Get the table side mozzarella. I thought it was very good, and the choice of seasoning salts is a nice touch. I had the braised beef spare ribs and they were delicious: tender, shredded with a fork, and great flavor. The gnocchi were perfect with a light, fluffy texture and were a great compliment to the garlic spinach. The ambiance was also nice, with dim lighting interwoven with firelight.  The bad: My friend's salmon was just ok. For over $20, it should've been much better.  The ugly: Nothing. Overall, a very nice place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix...service:  perfect, food: perfect (except for the chicken, which I felt was undercooked and haven't ordered again), ambiance: perfect, location: perfect.  I was there the other night to pick up a to-go order for my mother and sat at the bar for a drink...I ordered a raspberry martini and they didn't have the raspberry, so I was given a free drink while waiting for the food.  I love Phoenix City Grille, and will dine there every chance I get.  The bread pudding is TO DIE FOR!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday brunch and was very happy with everything. They have a special during brunch for 4 mimosas for $10. The service was great, they were quick to refill our mimosas and since they filled it in front of us, you could see that it was basically a whole flute of champagne and a splash of orange juice - just like I like it. I also tried their bloody mary and it was really really good. I wouldn't recommend it if you don't like your bloody mary spicy because it held a great kick - just like I like it.  About half of us ordered the eggs benedict, and the other half wish they ordered it because it was AMAZING. The eggs were cooked perfectly- with the white cutting like butter and the yolk dripping out with the perfect consistancy-- also the ham and the hollandaise sauce was extremely tasty (all on top of an English muffin).  It came with some home fries which were also delicious. We sat by the window, which they opened for us, it was the perfect whether on a Sunday morning, so that just made the event even better. It is a bit pricey but well worth it if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I had lunch, the food was great.  I had the meatball and prosciutto sandwich, came with a salad. Huge half went home. Also the potatoes with chimichurri sauce, amazing! . Norma Jeane drink was very good too. Staff was very nice and on top of things"}
{"text":"I don't like to give 5 stars but this is definitely a 5 star restaurant.  The décor is superb. A trendy atmosphere with modern décor.  Large open windows and incredible food.    I was most impressed by the service and felt compelled to write about my experience.  As a party of four when came to dine at Tanzy for a late lunch which changed over to dinner.  The couple we were with decided on ordering brunch. But my fiancée and were in the mood for a more filling meal and so we decided on the dinner menu.    The four of us enjoyed ourselves in conversations and our late afternoon drinks.  Our friend brunch came out first.  And we noticed that dinner meals were taking a bit of time. Then the manager of the restaurant personally came out and apologized for our meals taking so long to prepare.  He said that he will cut our bill a bit.   Shortly afterwards our meals came and it was delicious! When the bill came, we realized that the manager had taken all the food items off the bill and only charged us for drinks! Wow! That was above and beyond expectations!  I am only giving credit where credit is deserved!"}
{"text":"Ordered a margarita and found 3 small bugs floating in it. Looked Ike fruit flies. The waitress was nice though. I left without drinking it and of course after that did not want a new one."}
{"text":"This place was pretty average at best. There was nothing actually wrong with our meal (mine at least) but I felt like most dishes were heavy on the salt and my pasta was just OK. We did get the mozzarella sampler to start which was good but rather small for 6 of us to split, but we should've know to get more than one. I don't think I'd return here based on the price of food and the food quality. Nice lounge area when you first walk in with a fire, I would come back for drinks."}
{"text":"I had a great vodka strawberry lemonade! I was going to have lunch but my friend wasn't \"feeling\" the atmosphere. I think it was quite nice, I like dark elegant settings. I'm anxious to go back next week to try the chicken sandwich they are featuring for some chef contest!!! More to come..."}
{"text":"Hand pulled mozzarella (at the table!) with high quality prosciutto was a winner.  Family liked the crab cakes.  My branzino was very good but Israeli cous cous had too much cream, a more Mediterranean take would have been better.  Pappardelle was great.  Daughter loved the filet mignon.  My latte was great but tiramisu was too heavy.  Gelato was super, we had chocolate. The dining room is gorgeous, service was good.  I will return!  Valet parking was convenient"}
{"text":"Perfect night out for dinner and drinks! Although a bit pricey, Tanzy is about the same price of other upscale restaurants in Scottsdale. Service was impeccable and food was great. Portions were perfect size and you must try the table side mozzarella appetizers!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous restaurant! They spared no expense when designing it. Love the open air windows, firepit, bar area  Definitely this is a place to dress up and people watch the \"older\" Scts hipsters.  Atmosphere is one of the best in Scottsdale  HOWEVER...  Sadly  My tanzy salad was not so hot.  the lettuce was wilted and the other veggies were definitely old. I ended up getting a bad stomach for several days afterward.  I ordered chicken for the salad which was tasty and a good sized portion. My friends said they liked their food but I didnt hear \"delicious\" ever come out of their mouths.  One had scallops and the other had the roasted chicken.  If i were to return, i would order the scallops because not only did the plate look gorgeous, the mushrooms and sauce looked wonderful.  THe prices seemed high for the quality of the food.  The service was friendly and especially attentive with the water. The bread was warm and good too.  Id go back for drinks and light apps but not for dinner"}
{"text":"Came here late night with a large group for drinks and some food. I really liked the atmosphere with the open space, heat lamps and huge lounge seats.   All of the dishes we ordered looked great. Servings are generous and the prices are right. I had the grilled calamari with artichokes, absolutely fantastic. The calamari were fresh, tender and cooked perfectly.  Drinks are big also!  Service was a little slow, especially on the drinks and considering the place had cleared out for the most part due to the late hour. They actually card at the bar, two thumbs up!   This is good for people watching if you catch a table near the escalators, also a great place for a first date."}
{"text":"Service at the bar area is hit or miss. We had two bartenders waiting on us.  One made our drinks and delivered in record time.  We ordered a few apps and an entree. The apps all came but they completely forgot our entree.  After an hour of waiting we decided to leave."}
{"text":"Highs and lows across the board.  Went for Mothers Day brunch with another couple and kids.  11 of us all together.  The reservation was mistakenly made for 10, so 1 more shouldn't have been a hassle.  However, it took 10 minutes before they could figure out how to add 1 more chair and place setting to the table - so I grabbed a chair and silverware from another table and did it myself.  Depending on what you ordered, the food was either really tasty or really bland.  I ordered the skirtsteak and eggs.  It was under-seasoned and came with no potatoes or other sides.  Eggs were small and unsalted.  My friend ordered the smoked salmon sandwich and raved about it.  I had a taste of it from his plate and agreed that the salmon was very fresh.  The sandwich came with chive cream cheese, capers, red onions on a ciabatta bun.  I should have ordered that!  I also had a taste of the french toast sticks that all the kids ordered (very reasonably priced at $6).  I really liked the way they prepared it.  Deep fried so it was crispy on the outside and a moist on the inside - almost like a bread pudding consistency.  The kicker was the maple syrup with bacon bits mixed in. YUM!  The kids did not enjoy it as much as I did, since they were expecting \"traditional\" french toast (think IHOP) and the fake syrup that comes out of the bottle.  Can't fault the restaurant for that.  Overall service was prompt, but not very friendly.  Our server was definitely not glad to be working on that day.  The best moment of the day came when the server asked us:  \"Would you like some bread for the table?\" \"Sure,\" we said, and she came back with 2 lovely presentations of breads and pastries. What she DIDN'T tell us was that each one was $9!!!  Not cool.  Other highlights: The homemade donuts topped with jelly were fantastic. The bloody Mary was very much to my liking as it was loaded with horse radish - jus the way I like it.  My friend did NOT like his for the same reason, so what can you do? The wives enjoyed the mamosas which were a Mother's Day special at 4 for $10.    One major lowlight: I was geeked to see they had chicken and waffles on the menu for brunch.   But, because I've been burned before, I asked the server if the chicken was bone-in or just fried breast meat.  Unfortunatly, it was just a glorified chicken tender.  FAIL!!!!  NOTE TO ALL CHEFS:  If you're going to put chicken and waffles on the menu, it HAS TO BE BONE-IN (see LOLOs Chicken and Waffles for instructions).  The atmosphere was very impressive.  It's a  wide open restaurant on the second floor of the ultra-douchey mall Scottsdale Quarter (if you don't drive a Bentley, why even go there?)  Having said that, the place was very compfortable with a huge bar in the center and an open window-less environment that was perfect for the weather.    Overall, more of a date place than a good spot for Mothers Day.  The service needs some improvement in terms of attitude, but it was prompt and efficient.  The food was generally good, with some great highlights, but the place could be more consistent across the board.  Might go back on date night with the wife to give it another shot and order from the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Tanzy...the good and the bad.  Definitely a good ambiance.    A good place to meet up for drinks before dinner.  The dining room is kind of loud and the front of the restaurant with the couches is a good place to sit if you are just going to have appetizers and drinks.  The server seemed like she was an amateur.   I placed my drink order.  Then she came back and took my date's drink order and our appetizer order.   The appetizer came out before the drinks.  They took away the eaten appetizer dishes and brought out the entrée with no cutlery.  We got a chance to stare at our food for a few minutes before the wait staff procured a knife and fork.  I had the fillet and she had the spare rib.  The spare rib was delicious and tender.   The fillet was decent.    I know this place is new, so maybe their wait staff hasn't gotten their act together.  I get really annoyed when servers bring out the food and drink out of sequence.  The food is decent, the place looks swanky, but the service is lacking.  The servers are nice, but they just aren't very accurate.  I would eat here again, but it isn't on the top of my list.  There are a ton of other restaurants in this shopping center that I would try before coming back here."}
{"text":"I dined at Tanzy with 5 others last night. The staff could not have been more accommodating and provided great service. We enjoyed a peaceful and delicious dinner. Thanks!"}
{"text":"In a limited one-time visit, Tanzy is upscale in food and mid-range in service.    The menu offers traditional Italian dishes with a variety of meats. As a vegetarian though, I didn't have any trouble finding an option for me. We had a large table for six and everyone was satisfied with their dishes but the service started off inconsistent and got worse as the meal wore on.   The service problems weren't contained within one person - it was pervasive. The host seated the six of us at a table for four before being corrected by another member of the staff. Our drinks seemed to take quite a bit of time and then weren't exactly correct.   Apps and meals were served well but after the meal, the restaurant cleared out and we had a harder time finding our server. We ultimately chose not to order desert because our service dropped off.   The meal was notable though and I'd like to believe the service issues were either a one-time issue or just a state of affairs with the staff that evening. On top of that, we were a large party that came with no advance notice - it would be unfair to award fewer than four stars with these things in mind."}
{"text":"Awesome mozzarella made for you in front of your own eyes. Duck is served too rare if you ask me but all other things were fantastic so I'm giving it a 5 baby!!:))"}
{"text":"When here during a special Tuesday with some customers. The drinks were well priced during happy hour. There is an amazing cheese sauce dip creation which is heavenly and they made my food gluten free which was much appreciated. Ladies Tuesday... Strong recommend for the happy house prices."}
{"text":"Another great time at Tanzy!!! Brandon the bartender made me an exceptional old fashion cocktail! My wife had his perfectly pink Cosmopolitan! Loved the service Brandon gave us and we will definitely tell our friends! Thank you for a perfect night!"}
{"text":"While in Scottsdale for work, we were looking for some good restaurants, so I hit Yelp and as usual, was not disappointed.  Loved the modern decor and the food was great.  Desserts were very good, although, we were too full at that point to finish them!"}
{"text":"Tanzy proved to be a pleasant culinary surprise in the new Scottsdale Quarter shopping complex.   The upstairs, vaulted-ceiling, heavy use of creative metal design throughout has a welcoming and stylish feel. The large bar makes dropping in as a couple very approachable, although a reservation would be prudent for the weekend.    The food is very very good and has a freshness that only quality ingredients can provide. The tagliatelle bolognese comes in a heaping portion and fills you up without leaving you with a heavy pasta dinner feeling. If you're in the mood for a solid pasta meal, I would highly recommend this dish.   The braised beef short rib with goat cheese gnocchi is great, although the flavor profile came up a little short (I would recommend the short ribs at Citizen Public House over what Tanzy had to offer).   While I did not have a custom craft cocktail, I did appreciate the fact that each corner of the bar was equipped with lots of fresh fruit and every flavor of bitters you can imagine. I will be ordering one next time I stop by.   Finally, I always appreciate a bar/restaurant that serves a less  ordinary beer on tap in addition to serving craft cocktails and wine. In this case, I would highly recommend the Racer 5 IPA by Bear Republic Brewery."}
{"text":"I've been in Tanzy for drinks (they definitely have some good ones, but the one I remembered was the ginger sangria - memorable in a bad way. It tasted like patchouli or as my boyfriend put it \"this tastes like a hippie\").   Anyways, I had always been curious about the food. A couple weeks ago we decided to go in for brunch and caught some of the football games at the bar (a perfect compromise... football/bar for the boyfriend, nice atmosphere and good food for the lady). Our friendly bartender handed us their brunch menu and said he would come back to explain their brunch buffet. I looked at the menu and thought, what??? This is ridiculous! $20 for a standard eggs benedict??? Turns out you can get the brunch only for $14 or you can get a dish + the brunch for the advertised price of that dish. This also includes bottomless mimosas (their fresh squeezed oj was awesome). The buffet has charcuteries, cheeses, hummus, fruit, a variety of pastries and bagels, and a pancake station with at least 10 topping/filling options. I was craving savory, so I ordered the omelet and my boyfriend got the breakfast club sandwich. Both were really good, but so filling I didn't need a lot from the buffet.   To summarize my experience, Tanzy is a beautiful restaurant, has good food and friendly service. And $14-20 for brunch with bottomless mimosas... not too bad."}
{"text":"had my birthday brunch here on sunday. originally I had tried to plan a brunch at my home but I sent my invite last minute and everyone already had plans so we went out instead and it was a wonderful brunch after all. omg i had the best egg white veggie omelet. the veggies inside my omelet were fresh and not over salted. they had an awesome pancake station which I enjoyed. I ordered my pancake with chocolate chips! the mimosas and bloody marys were also a hit. The resto is beautiful and modern and seems like a great place to have drinks."}
{"text":"Stopped into Tanzy on a last minute decision and turned out to be a GREAT choice ! Food was excellent. The brussel sprouts app was friggin fantastic- seriously they were wonderful. I had the risotto which is was so good it inspired me to master my own risotto recipe at home (which i did, if you are wondering). Lova' had the pork and he didn't have any complaints. The beer selection was not the best but i did try a cucumber-limon martini and supa dupa refreshing!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place that I never knew existed. I had been to the Scottsdale Quarter to lunch at Brio and True Foods but never knew this place was there. On the second floor. Right- who knew- second floor? It is part of the ipc theater. There is Tanzy the restaurant, Salt, the lounge and then the ipic theater where you can dine and recline while watching a movie and being served. Been to lunch several times and had the proscuitto wrapped asparagus salad which came with mixed greens, red and yellow tomatoes and strawberries drizzled with a balsamic dressing. It also had a set of crostini with a delicious cheese spread on them. I went today with a friend and was looking forward to having it again....and it was gone! WHAT?? So we split the cedar plank salmon with the israeli cous cous and the shrimp/crab cobb salad. All very good! Check out my pictures too.   Great relaxing decor overlooking the water fountains and palm tress swaying on one side and the mountains on the other."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Lisa, Shannon and Carla at the bar are fantastic ! We always stop for a pre-movie visit and beverage!  After the movie we had a Tanzy salad  $8 that was huge and the cedar plank salmon $24 .. it was not busy at the time we were there but it was Tuesday ! This restaurant has always had wonderful food. A certain must is the homemade mozzarella tableside for $18. It is so delicious and a special treat on occasion. Great wine list and happy hour !"}
{"text":"Love Love Love Tanzy!!! The bartenders are Awesome!! Shea, Karla & Andy are my faves! They can custom make drinks that aren't on the menu that are completely AmaZing!!! The entire menu is Delicious!!! I'm a sucker for the Tanzy Salad with grilled Chicken and steamed mussels pooh and the Tanzy Burger!!! Everyday is Funday starting with Brunch on Mimosa Sunday's $10/4!!! Tuesday is Penny Martini's yes 1¢ martini's No gimmicks!! then Friday and Saturday live DJ. And of course you can watch the game anytime at the bar before you head off to the movies at iPic. What's not to love. Good people, Great Drinks, #FunTimes #Cheers"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day with a friend. The food was yum! The portions were generous. Service was great. Our server's name was Blake and he was just sweet as can be.   I can't wait to come back and try it for happy hour because I have heard good things."}
{"text":"My Ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and was full of flavor. Getting the fresh mozzarella at our table was super fun. The Red Velvet Bread Pudding was a fantastic dessert option too (not overly sweet, but very savory)."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to dine here this past Friday night and were very impressed.  Our waitress Michelle was very knowledgable about both the menu and the wine list.  She recommended the short ribs and a really nice pinot noir to go along with my meal, and I absolutely LOVED it.   Michelle informed us that the menu will be changing next week and that we should definitely come back.  Um, yeah, absolutely returning!  My wife's birthday is coming up soon and I am definitely bringing her and friends back for the celebration.   New favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Struggle with not giving it 2 but can't kill them completely for food we could never ordered and it looked promising. Sat at the 1/2 of the bar that the bartender decided to ignore after dropping off apps and wine.  Ready to reorder 2 wines and 2 entrees, we decided to leave after 20 min of empty glasses and plates.  Maybe will come back, but to much other competition to make it back any time soon."}
{"text":"WOW!  What an amazing experience at this restaurant!!!  My wife and I went to a movie and stopped in the bar for a quick couple drinks.  We initailly stood at the end of the bar for quite a while and were never noticed as new customers but everyone was busy so I don't hold that against anyone.   But once we made our way around to a more \"popular\" part of the bar, the bartender, Danny, was all over us.  The one thing I liked about this guy is that no matter how busy he was, he was down-to-earth, made us feel that he was paying attention and truely wanted to take care of us.  I ordered what he referred to as an Icepick (I think) which is essentially an Arnold Palmer with vodka and my wife ordered a water.  There was a female co-worker of his who ensured things were good and even checked on my wife's tiramisu when she saw it was taking a while to come out.  Everything about this place was appealing - the ambience, the decor, the menu, the patios and firepits and most importantly, the service.  In fact, I mentioned to my wife that when I open my restaurant, I want it to look and feel the way Tanzy does.  I just finished writing a negative review about Brio and my recommendation is that Tanzy hold a \"how to treat your customers\" class.  If that happened, every restaurant in that complex would be top notch.  Thank you to the entire staff we dealt with for caring!!!  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"The husband and I went to Tanzy for the Breakfast Club UYE, and it was lovely! The restaurant is beautiful, very large and decorated nicely. The service was great, attentive, accommodating of our large party and of the husband and I's special requests... it was nice. The husband and I both had the brunch prix fixe, which is a decent deal at 22$ for a mimosa, a side/dessert and an entree. The boca mimosas were delicious.... a mimosa with passion fruit and blood orange juices.... this was a fabulous drink, order it, love it. The husband had the waffle with bacon (and it was a large side of bacon) and he thought it was just ok. I had the eggs benedict and subbed bacon for the ham and it was delicious. The eggs were perfectly cooked, the hollandaise was chipotle flavored (or something) and had wonderful spice, and the bacon was crispy and well seasoned (it had red pepper flake and other seasonings on it). The benedict came with breakfast potatoes (and that didn't count as the side), and they were good... crispy and cooked with peppers and onions... liked that. For my side/dessert I got the red velvet bread pudding and ended up getting it to go (I was so full and had somewhere to be).... even the next day, this was a yummy dessert... maybe not my favorite dessert ever, but good. I would consider coming here again for brunch... but they don't open until 11, which is WAY too late (for me). Maybe lunch? Yes. Anyway, if you're a late riser, check this out!"}
{"text":"For the high price, I think the food is just ok. Nothing I had there was great, only the waiter, Ivan! We had some prosciutto, which was good, but unusually salty. The bread was toasted, but tasted stale. Meatballs were ok, and scallops were alright. Caesar salad needed a lot of salt, very bland."}
{"text":"I would like to update this post and say management has been very kind and attentive. They addressed my concerns and even sent me a gift card. Talk about a great team!   I feel like I have given this place so many chances and they just continually fail to impress. I've been here twice for brunch and their food is mediocre. The presentation is good and it always looks like it should taste better than it does.   I went today for lunch and ordered the quinoa and goat cheese salad with chicken. The chicken was really over cooked and dry. The lettuce was limp, I believe due to how much dressing was on it, however it was hard to tell because he dressing had almost no flavor to it. One thing that was actually pretty great was the goat cheese. It's a medallion that is encrusted with almonds, fried (I think) and drizzled with a balsamic vinegar glaze. Fabulous!   Long story short, I won't ever go here again unless I have to. There are just too many restaurants on this block to be stuck with sub-par food."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. I came here for my boyfriends birthday and both of us had never been. We had incredible service. I wish I can remember the name of my server but she was awesome. I was in the mood to try a new wine and she brought out testers for every wine I said I was interested in. I even told her no it's ok and she said no try them first! Same with my boyfriend he didn't know what beer to get and she brought out a few to try. She went out of her way for us even though it was a busy night. We had great tasting food and at the end of the night they brought out a dessert and comped it for his birthday. It was such a great experience"}
{"text":"Great location.  Total eye candy."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I wish i could rate the food for you but we couldn't get that far because the service is so terrible. Our waitress dropped off the wrong order to us and then spent the entire night standing over by her friends table. Clearly she was giving them free food which generally I could care less about.  When we asked the bartender for the right drink she sent our waitress over and all we got is attitude.  Theres far too many options at Scottsdale Quarter to deal with this place. 4 drinks for $40 and terrible service, no thanks."}
{"text":"We really love the ambiance at Tanzy, the decor, the tables, the warmth etc.  I tried the pasta bolognese this past weekend, and thought it was especially delicious.  The service was outstanding and we really enjoyed our visit.  The only thing I was bummed about was the cocktails.  I ordered one of the lemon-lime blood orange martinis, and had a difficult time choking it down.  For $11, I think they should use something better than infused Svedka vodka to make the cocktail a little smoother.  At that price point, it should at least be Stoli or Absolut.  Other than that, we thought the food was good and the portions were hefty."}
{"text":"Our group came here last night after dinner at the Persian Room. First time for me at Tanzy, loved it! We got a great area by the fire pit surrounded by couches and ottomans. Ordered after dinner drinks and dessert ( I will have to come for dinner since the menu has many diverse items!)   My drink choice was the spice and ice martini ( a little sweet, a little spice, all amazing!). And for dessert we sampled the red velvet bread pudding (decadent!) and the white chocolate and chambord creme brûlée ( perfection!). Great way to end the night!!"}
{"text":"Their restaurant and drinks are fabulous and the brunch entrees are made to perfection! Fantastic eggs benedict! Kaleb our server was incredibly polite and attentive as well. What a great find!"}
{"text":"Do not ever consider hosting an event here unless you get something in writing. We had reserved the room in the back for 40 people. I sent out 375 invitations letting people know about our event at Tanzy. Unfortunately a couple days ago, their catering manager informed me we would be in the lounge. I'm assuming someone more important wanted the space so they had priority. We will be hosting the event  at Dominick's across the street. Where they keep their word on our reservations. I'm sure the food will be better anyway.   Also, another time we ate there with another couple, 1/2 of the stuff we tried to order they were out of!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Came here for a date night. The food was overpriced and there was nothing special about our meal. Both of us thought it was bland, I had the branzino and my date had a pasta dish. Tanzy has potential with its beautiful decor, but I wouldn't waste a date night here."}
{"text":"Met family at Tanzy while shopping with my daughter for her birthday at the Quarter.  Lunch was good, portions sizes are generous. My daughter and I both had the Tanzy Salad with Salmon, very tasty, with a good portion of salmon but eat it with caution since there are olives in the salad and not all the olives apparently are pitted. My daughter luckily didn't break a tooth when she bit down on 2 olives with pits still in them which for the birthday girl didn't make for the most comfortable eating experience. We seemed to be the only guests there for brunch so we had our server to ourselves."}
{"text":"Tanzy's update. All I can say is UNBELIEVABLE. From the minute I posted a critical review to the visit last Saturday night, the General Manager and one of his staff members were in frequent, humble and apologetic contact with me.  The GM, Ben, left me his cell number!!!! and asked if we would return and give them the opportunity to demonstrate their high standards of service. My friends had frequented this restaurant MANY times and it was their \"go to\" place. Having said that, after our disappointing experience in late December they decided they weren't going to return.....ever.  In fact, they felt it was risky to continue to take out of town guests there if ours was the kind of \"customer experience\" they could expect.  Ben arranged for our visit, came by the table and chatted and checked in with us on a few occasions (but without being intrusive) Our Server, Charlie was just amazing and we followed nearly all of his recommendations.  And Matt, who prepared the table side cheese (mozzarella) was wonderful and VERY knowledgeable about particular unique salts/spices and oil to use for different tastes....if there is such a thing as a \"cheese sommelier\" Matt is one.  And the experience of the table side preparation is entertaining and informative..  Our food was delicious from the calamari appetizer (best I have EVER had) to the Branzino, Steaks and even the chocolate ganache cake with banana carmel ice cream.  If you have had a less than stellar experience here recently or if you haven't been in awhile, GO BACK! You will be so impressed with the attention to detail, the informative and warm servers, the excellent food and ambiance.  Huge thanks again to Tanzy's.  My friends will most certainly return and we were all were thrilled to have such a memorable meal."}
{"text":"Well, this experience was interesting. We walked up asked the host if there was anything available he said 30 minutes. We decided to sit at the bar and have a drink. Before we sat at the bar I asked the 16 year old taking names if i could put my name down just in case we wanted to sit at a table. She asked if I had a reservation. Uhm No. She said there was nothing available. By the way it was only 7:30pm. We found 2 seats at the bar. Behind us was about 7 open tables. Hmm nothing available? After about 10 minutes finally one of the 6 bartenders noticed us. My wife asked for a blueberry press - No blueberry vodka. Then she asked for Captain - Uhm no Captain. Finally an orange press. Clearly the bartender had no idea how to make one. I just saw Makers behind him, so to play it safe I asked for Makers. Didn't want to confuse him.   After this we decided that we would only order an appetizer. Dinner might seem too painful. So we ordered the Grilled Calamari. I have to say it was amazing. The Calamari was thick and grilled perfectly the artichokes and everything were delicious. We actually thought maybe we should just order dinner. Then the 15 minute wait until the bartender asked us if we were ok - so Check please!  From just having that one appetizer I have to say the food is great. The service on all ends was terrible. Not sure if I will attempt again."}
{"text":"Loved our dinner at Tanzy!  The white fish with lobster and summer squash was amazing!  And the cheesecake topped with chocolate is a must!  Friendly fast service.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"OMG. Soooooooo good.  Things you must try while here.... 1. Table side mozzarella. Appetizer for 2. Divine. Seriously, really effing good. I'm not kidding.  2. The grilled bone in pork chop. It's a meal for two unless you're VERY hungry. Now I for one am a guy that likes chunks of meat with a bone sticking out of it. This chop nails it.   Beautiful restaurant. Fantastic food. Server was AMAZEBALLS. He had a brain fart tho. (Wrote that in there for his benefit, good job Tyler. Thanks for the oranges)   All in all, go here. Eat. Then tell me I was right."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here gets a 5/5 stars. The place is very nice for a date or a night out with the girls. There's a bar area with Lounge seating and a fire. The back of the restaurant has a huge wine room that's very impressive. The restaurant is quiet and dark and relaxing for a night out. We ordered the Wagyu steak and the scallops with the table side mozzarella to start. Everything was amazing and delicious. This was our second time visiting and this visit everything tasted a lot better than our first visit. They've made changes to the food and the menu for the better! Our meal was fantastic and the service was super friendly as well!"}
