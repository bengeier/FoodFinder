{"text":"Great place for a delicious halal burger (that is not a bun kebab).  Fries and poutine leave much to be desired."}
{"text":"Just got home with my take out poutine from Big Moes. I had high hopes from the pics on Yelp (plus I like the shredded mozzarella more than cheese curds).   Sadly the fries are completely raw on the inside. It's like eating an underdone baked potato.   VERY disappointing and wouldn't recommend.   Also didn't love the extra charge for a debit transaction."}
{"text":"These guy are famous just because they serve halal food , but this does not means they can do whatever they want , they are not people of words ,  worst customer service , worst commitment accomplishers. I bought voucher from Buytopia which said it can be used after 72 hours , but hen I reached there they didn't accepted and told me it's the mistake of Buytopia , it's valid from 1st January 2016. Secondly 2 of my vouchers didn't had dates printed , which is not my mistake , they told it's a scam . Now why will any one scam for $20 They really gave me hard time"}
{"text":"You know big moes and I go way back. I live right in the area. Their food used* to be good and it still is when this one particular woman isn't working there. She's really rude, doesn't care about your orders, doesn't talk to you when you're there and she always grumpy. After I got home to eat, I was really upset that there was no ketchup in the bag. I called them to ask if they usually put ketchup in the takeout bag if you're getting fries, she says \"Oh if you see it, we did or if you don't, then we didn't, is this what you're really calling about?\" what does that even mean?   I was just standing there waiting for my takeout order and she \"throws \" the paper bag with my food on the counter, \"HERE!\" she yells. And the bag is half ripped. Also, I suggested to my friend to let's eat here and same lady again served us poutine that looked and tasted absolutely disgusting. When I called to inquire about it the next day - was told should've come back with it right away (fair enough) --- we don't make our poutine like that blah blah blah. Excuses excuses. This place used to be good but with service like that it's going to go down. They need to get rid of her.   Nobody should support a place with this kind of service!!!"}
{"text":"I called Big Moe's to try to speak to a manager or supervisor after getting a COMPLETELY  WRONG order.   From the burgers, to the sides and drinks, and was told \"we don't have one\". The person answering the phone told me I could speak to the chef. I then spoke to \"Jonathan\" attempting to correct an order, .  \"Jonathan\" informed me that he's the chef. He received my order requests, but only after he was done cooking my order, and decided to send it anyway, including all side orders being wrong as well as the drinks.  The order requests were due to food allergies.   The \"chef\" decided to tell me off saying, \"brother, I make it how the menu is. I got the request late, but we sent the order anyway. I don't have a car to bring you what you ordered, what do you want?   You have the food\".    I did not ask him to deliver the food, I asked him how we solve this issue.   He then followed up with telling me to go fuck myself.   After calling the owners, they informed my partner and I that they were sorry, but couldn't help to refund the order.  PATHETIC    Here are the issues   1: If what you made isn't what's ordered, you don't just send it anyway   2:  Who is in charge here?  This is a pathetic performance on running a food franchise. It would be interesting if this store is owned by original Company and not a franchisee   3: The staff have no idea how to talk to people. I would say this is the fault of management not being able to recruit or train people to work in their fast food establishment on duties of filling orders accurately, nor customer interaction   Forget the food, I can order more. WHY  would any reasonable person want to be part of your franchise when this is the example of staff training and interaction you show the public?    Pull yourselves off of #ubereats until you train your staff.   #epicfail #badservice #stayaway #badbadnogood #torontofood #ubereats #craveto"}
{"text":"I used to love this place and go every week for a Juicy Lucy and Salt Lick Caramel Ice cream. I ended up taking a whim one day and checking out their chicken burger the day of their special and unfortunately that was the worst decision ever. After waiting almost 25 mins to get my burger I was excited to give it a try. Unfortunately after getting almost half way through my burger I realized it was undercooked. I caught food poisoning the entire week after and haven't been back since. They should really stay up to their standards on special days because they will continue to lose regular customers. Oh and clearly do not go on special days!!"}
{"text":"Ive tried to like their burgers but can't. It's an over priced burger with nothing special about it. There are way better burger joints than this one."}
{"text":"In a nutshell the experience was a big disapppointment. I went there around 2 p.m. There was no one in the restaurant. I placed my order with the friendly cashier which was the only good point. The rest went downhill pretty quickly.  The burger is at best a 2-star. As I was watching the grill master cook my burger, he squished the patty after it was cooked such that any juice remaining left the burger. The patty was dry and the taste was not fresh at all.  The fries were horrible. Not made with care and although I realize that fresh cut fries can sometimes be soggy depending on the season, these were just not well made.   Overal, there is no reason to return to Big Moe's. I will try their other locations to see if they are any better."}
{"text":"Went for funnel cake. There were no other customers. We Looked around at the floor and cooking area and noticed the place was dirty, so we left without ordering. No customers, yet the staff was just standing around, ignoring the filth."}
{"text":"Great burger but need a better location to eat. Not comfy at all. The fries are hit or miss."}
{"text":"Got there just after noon and there was a line. It took 20 minutes before I was able to place my order, yes twenty, then another 10 minutes to get my order. They didn't have any change, so I was forced to pay debit.  The burger should have been flattened more, as the burger was so thick, there was a ton of bun, with no burger. The best part of the meal was the fries, but most of my box were tiny pieces.  I don't know it was just a bad day that I got sub par food, or if this is the norm, nest time I'll just go to the Pizza Pizza across the street."}
{"text":"My wife and I came by on a Sunday evening. Very little wait time, which is nice for freshly cooked. We both had a juicy Lucy as it was our first time. Burger was well cooked and moist. But you don't really notice the cheese all that much, so we'll try a normal cheeseburger next time. We had the poutine with our combos, and warning, the poutines are HUGE! A meal on their own. The wifey felt the poutine was a smidge bland, and I would have liked slightly crispier fries, but all in all, more then good enough to warrant return trips."}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEATS and I got myself a regular Juicy Lucy and a chicken Juicy Lucy, one of the best burgers I've had. I recommend others to solely buy those two."}
{"text":"Would NOT recommend!  The Poutine wasn't good at all. The single cheeseburger was average at best.  It's not the portion size that is the issue, it's the quality. Put it this way, for the $13.50 I paid, I would have been much better off to go to Southwest Burger which is just a few kilometres away."}
{"text":"The people are always friendly and I like that I can go there really late in the night. Parking is free too! Their burgers are awesome but I have to take off one star for the size that I get for my money.  It's quite pricey but maybe all Halal food is costs a little  bit more?   The funnel cakes though is the best thing on their menu. I'd go there just for that!"}
{"text":"I called in to ask if they delivered. The guy on the phone said no. I said but the site says you deliver he than changed his answer to say yes only in selective area's. So I than asked do you deliver in Scarborough? He said no and I swear they are located in Scarborough. SMH. I've read all the reviews on here and got hype to order from them but I'll stick with Real Mccoys as their burgers are big and delicious and their poutines are amazing. I don't think I'd ever attempt to go to this place because honestly they don't seem to know their feet from their heads. How can you not deliver in Scarborough when you are located in Scarborough he didn't even try to get my address to see how far he was from me which isn't that far at all but its whatever they lost a costumer in fact quite a few cause I order for my family. That is just terrible service now I have to go in search again for another place. I do wish Real Mccoys was open on Sundays or I wouldn't even be writing this review right now. SMH."}
{"text":"The tastiest burgers in town. Place look like a trucker's pit stop but the burger is better than the Priest's Burger. Juicy and cheesy mmmmm."}
{"text":"Over priced. The person who made my burger was on their cellphone and didn't wash their hands afterwards.  After i got my burger there was a hair inside the bun. Not happy, especially when burger is 7 dollars without a drink or fries on the side."}
{"text":"Big Moe's has their own version of the Big Mac, called the Double Stacker. When the cook walks out with that fresh ball of ground beef, to slap on the grill, you know they're doing it right. Their burgers are freshly pressed, and perfect. Fresh cut fries, and funnel cakes as well, it reminds me of being at a small town fair in the summer.  The restaurant itself needs a little updating, but really, I come for the burgers."}
{"text":"The burger I ordered - triple B was the most expensive on the menu and it had two juicy patties and bacon beef. (This place is halal so no pork)   The patty was very juicy but when I took the burger out the wrapper it was seriously soaked in oil. Too oily for my liking but what did I expect with getting the biggest burger on the menu. Quiet when I ate there, with service that was adequate- you order and sit then pick your meal up when they call.  The poutine was alright, not the best but wouldnt recommend. They had funnel cake too but I was so full from my burger there was no room. Coming back and trying the other burgers! Loved it."}
{"text":"Ordered a double cheese burger combo with fries and a drink for $18. The burger was really good but the fries were overcooked and tasted bad again. This was my second time here and they served the fries dark brown both times. Did not like the service either. No one smiles and they all look like they hate their jobs. The burger was great though, and that's why I'm giving them three stars."}
{"text":"Craving for halal burger, big moes does justice. There burger patty Is thick, juicy and flavorful. It will surely fill you up. It has a lasting taste & that will make you come back for more. The service Is quick & they are willing to answer all your questions regarding what type of burger and how spicy you want it l.  Definitely would recommend it."}
{"text":"After all the travelling I did, after all the walking I decide it was good idea to just absorb the calories I burned during my walk but it was worth it, it was good  I had the funnel cake which i was craving since a friend of mine brought it up a  few night ago and it was light and filling but I did have the juicy lucy too so it was a lot of good food that was worth it. I did walk to my next location and final library stop."}
{"text":"These 5 stars are strictly for their burgers, specifically the Juicy Lucy.  I knew straight from the first bite, that I had fallen in love. The Juicy Lucy puts the Mojo burger at Real McCoy's to shame. Not even sure why I'm making the comparison. We'll have to see how this burger stands up to Five Guys."}
{"text":"Juicy Lucy with beef strips is the sexiest burger I've ever tasted. I wanted seconds. God help me if I become pregnant because I'll murk this place. I'm also happy this place is halal :)   The beef strips is suppose to mimic bacon but it actually taste better then bacon :P  Great customer service. I preordered my food on the phone and order was ready for pick up when I got there."}
{"text":"Great burgers for the price if you buy them on the days they're on special. Nothing on the menu is worth the menu price. Plus: they take Visa now. Customer service is either really good or bad; there is no in-between. It makes sense to not substitute toppings on the burgers (on special) if the restaurant is busy... But I went in then it was empty and they wouldn't let me substitute tomato for mayo, weird. Overall, good place for cheap burgers. Have never seen them wipe the tables."}
{"text":"If I don't feel like driving up north to my number one burger place ** Fresh Burger **, I would just drive a couple blocks away and go to Big Moe's for a quick bite.  I came in last Saturday and tried their weekend walk-in special which was a chicken burger with mayo and lettuce (I don't think you are allowed to modify burgers on this special) and fries for $4.99. Good deal huh? This was the second time I tried their walk-in special, the first time was great, but last Saturday the chicken burger was HEAVILY peppered, I cannot finish it!  I would not be coming back if it is the same lady working who put too much pepper on my chicken burger. And also they are understaffed. There was an old man who had to wait 15 minutes just to place his order. Food takes so long to prepare as well. I would go to their other locations and see if I get better service."}
{"text":"Usually my reviews are pretty detailed, but this one will be fairly short -- went there today for the first time and left satisfied.  My friend and I each got the Tuesday special -- cheeseburger for $2.49. It was quite good and we'd get it again. It only comes with lettuce, mayo, and ketchup (no alterations on the Tuesday special) but for what it was, it was quite good.  The service is a little on the slow side, but it tasted fresh so I'll let that slide. The ingredients paired well together. Would I pay $5.79 for that cheeseburger on its own, which is the price every other day? Absolutely not. It wasn't very filling, but for $2.49, it was satisfying and a decent enough value.  We plan to go back and try their other specials. Their regular menu prices are otherwise quite high -- $11 or $12 for a burger combo."}
{"text":"Burgers are fresh, never frozen. Buns are delivered daily. Deliciously juicy. Super cheap on Tuesdays. It's under $3 for a cheeseburger on Tuesdays, and the lineup is quite something when it is. The patties have that lovely slight char on the  edges that make them crisp, and in order to get that char, it does take time for the burger to cook. Sometimes, they'll let you order before you arrive. On Tuesdays, it depends on who you try to place the order with. I believe everything here is halal. I could be wrong.  I've also tried the Juicy Lucy (their take on a hamburger with the cheese stuffed into the middle of the patty so that it oozes when you cut into it). It did not live up to my expectations, but I'm not particularly into cheese.  Even with the long lineups on Tuesday, I'd still suggest you come."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss every time I go. It's never consistent! One day the meat is too salty, next day its too dry, next time there's no flavour etc. Customer service is terrible. You could be waiting over 10 minutes though you're the next order on the list. I've had a few good days with the burgers when the owner Moe was in and helping his staff cook the burgers. Other than that, this place is unreliable.  Burger's however are delicious when done right. Juicy Lucy and the cheeseburger has always been my favorite.  Price: $4-$12"}
{"text":"This is a Halal burger joint. Practically speaking the only difference I can see is that they use beef bacon (I actually didn't notice a difference).  Ground beef is cooked on the grill from raw in front of you.  Staff are nice willing to explain your options.  The burger was Tasty. Five guys esque.    The one tomato I got was the bottom piece... Not a fan of that. I like lots of tomato.  The juicy juicy concept was ok. The cheese was an odd texture, possibly because it was cooked between the beef. The cheese wasn't evenly spread...it was more if a ball in the Center of the paddy.  Serious burger joint faux pas; they use shredded mozz, not curds on their Poutine. (Which I didn't have, so I can't say more than that).   That is literally the worst thing I could say. On the whole it was tasty."}
{"text":"Open late night. Good selection of burgers to choose from. Open kitchen clean environment. The daily specials are a nice plus - http://www.bigmoes.ca/menu/list-menu#daily   The burgers are well cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend adding sauce for extra flavor. Burgers are average in size, reflecting the price.   Would not recommend the fries. Lack flavor, skimpy, with a soggy consistency.   For the type of food, location, operating hours Big Moes is a good spot for a quick burger run. The daily specials are worth it. Wouldnt necessarily go out of my way, but would recommend and would go again.    3.5/4 out of 5"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now Strangely enough it's the only Burger joint in the neighborhood so there's not much competition in this field.  Recommended you try the Juicy Lucy Burger since it's what they built their reputation on. It's a home made patty with a chunk of cheese on the inside so when you bite into it it just oozes out cheese.   Overall they make a damn good burger and have a good chewy bun that holds the thing together. Good choice of toppings and good home made fries. I tried their poutine this time and even though they don't use cheese curd they were lost in good gravy and loaded with cheese and definitely hit the spot  Certainly not a fancy place but the service is always with a smile and fairly fast considering they make it from scratch."}
{"text":"Ordered from Big Moes using UberEats and I will never eat there again. Burger was dry and flavourless and the poutne was made with shredded cheese rather than curds and also tasted rather dry"}
