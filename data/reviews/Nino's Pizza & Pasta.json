{"text":"My family frequents Nino's Pizza and Pasta frequently. This restaurant was formerly Anzi's Pizza and Pasta, but it is the same owner. Don't let the name change fool you. Every time we order for delivery, they are so much later than they specify. So if you're hungry, order two hours earlier than you want the food. The part-owner, Phil was extremely rude when I called to complain about the lateness. They were 20 minutes late. So we were waiting 1 hour and 20 minutes for two salads. There are so many other italian restaurants around, we really don't need to wait that long for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Yup, its a-ok (3 stars)for the overall experience. The food is still very good and I'm still a fan (4 stars), but the customer service is lacking. 

Ordered by phone to pick up before the football games. Arrived to find out the order had never been processed. OK, i get it. Sometimes things happen, but don't try and keep it a secret. Own up to it. Waited for 15 minutes for a great pizza, but never a \"sorry\" or \"thanks for waiting\". They did give me a free Coke while I waited (secret apology). 

So in conclusion: If you're going to order during \"busy\" times (Olympic games, curling final), you might want to really verify your order over the phone or walk-in, order and then do some shopping next door."}
{"text":"I really don't care TOO much for Italian food, for the simple fact I like SPICE, and most places here are bland, BUT Anzi Pizza & Pasta has kudos from me!

I love their Stromboli!! Sometimes they put too much cheese (be careful not to choke on it!). I haven't really tried anything else. I ate something else the first time I went but forgot what it was, lol. - They are a bit pricey!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best purveyor of Italian food at Stonecrest!  Although a tad over-priced, they are pretty good in their own right as well."}
{"text":"Since we were feeling lazy last night, we decided to order a Chicken Parm Pizza to be delivered.  The pizza arrived faster than expected and was nice and hot. The crust was just right, sauce was fresh and it had the perfect amount of cheese.  Only downside was the parnesan chicken -they were a little skimpy with that. Other than that, the quality was good."}
{"text":"This place has horrible customer service. We had a coupon for \"2 large pies\" and since there was no mention of a topping limit we assumed it could be used any pizza. When we called to place our order we had to speak to a completely useless incompetent manager. He told us that the coupon was good for cheese pizzas only and we would have to pay extra for any additional toppings. I explained that this was not listed on the coupon and that the wording on coupon was very misleading. He was very unapologetic and said there was nothing he could do about it because he couldn't change how the computer rang in the coupon. This an absolutely ridiculous excuse! I find it hard to believe that there is a business out there that is run solely by the computer and has no employees that can override it or change pricing information. It is very sad that there was \"nothing\" he could about a poorly written coupon for a couple extra pizza toppings."}
{"text":"Pretty solid pizza for the area. Definitely better than any big box chain around. I love how generous they are with the ricotta. The white pizza is my fave so far. Clumps and clumps of ricotta make me quite happy. 
Another plus is that they will deliver. I live about 5 miles away and its never a problem.
Avoid the wings tho, the last time I ordered them they were way less then appetizing. The slimiest wings i have ever had. We even resorted to putting them into the oven hoping to make them edible. Fail. Ended up just throwing them away. 
So pizza good- worth a try, wings- no way jose."}
{"text":"My 4 y/o nephew wanted pizza and since I was bringing him to the movies in the same shopping center, I figured this was our best bet.  What a pleasant surprise this pizza was!  I hadn't read any reviews and didn't know what to expect, but it was really good.  I tried a slice of plain and the supreme, which I did take a bunch of toppings off because I really just wanted the mushrooms and onions.  But it was thin and crispy with a good chewy crust.  I'd definitely go back if I was nearby."}
{"text":"I order Pasta - This place probably Specializes in Pizza and the Pizza looked very good!  So I am skeptical about my order!  My dish comes to the table, looks and tastes very good!  Next time I'll check out a Pizza and they have a 24 inch!

Great service!  Everyone working had an upbeat attitude!  Very Polite!  The staff appeared to be mostly teenagers, all seemed happy to be there and this was Friday night, two days before Christmas.

The patrons were mostly Families with preteen children so next time I'll get here a little later and see if any of my friends are eating here!  Watching movies usually makes me want to get some food!"}
{"text":"Line out the door at Smashburger....well, we'll wait for the shine to wear off that one. 45 minute wait at City Tavern--but I'm hungry now!  And so we ended up at Anzi for a pre-movie pizza.

I've only ever had pizza at Anzi, and it's pretty good, although not the best I've ever had. It's served piping hot and with generous toppings. Downsides are that it's a little greasy (I blot it with a napkin, which is something I rarely do) and the crust is a little bland after you eat down that far.  It's also on the pricey side.

The location itself is too small for the amount of business they get. This seems to be true of many places at Stonecrest; perhaps the developers of the area underestimated the traffic they'd get."}
{"text":"I think that the Italian food is authentic, but the food was extremely heavy. I ordered a Chicken Hero and salami stromboli. The stromboli was probably over a foot long and it was gigantic. I got full after eating a quarter of it. The chicken hero was decent, but I've had a better chicken sub/sandwich. This is not a good place for health conscious eaters."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give Anzi more stars.  When I worked off of Independence Blvd (same place as Chad) years ago, Anzi was one of the favorite lunch spots and always the place where we ordered pizza from.  People would line up outside the door to eat here because it was so good.

I've seen the Stonecrest location for years but this was my first visit there.  Unfortunately, I left a little disappointed.

The ordering process is the same as the Independence store.  You walk up, order, they bring it out to you.  The menu is extensive.  I was going to see a movie so I wanted something quick.  So I ordered 2 slices of pepperoni pizza.

What came out were two slices of pizza on what looked like a ready bake crust.  They could have let the pizza in the oven an little longer to give the crust a more golden brown color.  I also like my pepperoni to be slightly curled and a little crispy with nicely browned edges.  This was not.  Again, it seemed a little undercooked to my taste.

The slices were huge but it just lacked the taste that I was looking for.   So after years of raving about Anzi, I think I'll go back to Portofino's and Luigis as my places for Italian pie."}
{"text":"Some 14 years ago, I moved to Charlotte, and worked in a location next door to the Anzi location on Independence.  In fact, we could sneak in the back door, carefully avoiding mop buckets and not looking too closely at the inner workings of the kitchen or looking in the restroom to get to the actual dining room.  When you actually got to the counter, you were met with a veritable cornucopia of Italian delight.  How about that - another mix of culture - this time Greek and Italian.

Anyway, some time back it seems that the original owners of that location moved on.  The Independence location was taken over others (and subsequently went way downhill, offering essentially pizza, which wasn't quite so good) and moved to open this location in Stonecrest.  They also seem to have another location in Locust, which I believe is related - but I haven't been there to try it.

Imagine my delight when we stopped into Anzi, purely for nostalgia, only to find that the pizza and garlic knots are almost exactly the same recipe as they were all those years ago?  To make things even better, those recipes are really good.  The knots are among the best in town - not just  ball of hard dough, but light and crispy, with tons of garlic.  The pizza is just the same as I remember it too.

The only downside is that the price is a bit on the high side.  For a couple of slices, some knots and drinks, you can easily come out near $20.  But it is tasty."}
{"text":"We tried out Anzi for the first time after reading about their \"eat a 2 foot pizza in 30 mins\" contest in a local mag. Apparently, their man vs. pizza challenge has had numerous patrons walking away with pizza filled bellies but no cigar. The wall of shame is something to be seen, despite it's grade school aesthetics. Aside from the lure of the challenge, we decided to order hero sandwiches. The sandwiches were freaking  humongous! Holy F! We should have just ordered half of one and that would have been enough to split between me, my husband, and our 15 month old son.  Food was decent we plan to go back for a piece of their pie and hopefully witness a man vs. pizza challenge."}
{"text":"Great crust, sauce is pretty sweet, cheese is not the greatest. Overall just an ok pizza."}
