{"text":"Food is fresh and tasty.  I live right around the corner and the only problem is they seem to be closed too often on weekends and days that I have off - so it would be great if their hours improved."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great quality foods for breakfast, lunch and snacks or even great coffee - this is the place to be!   You can not get any fresher with your ingredients! All the food is prepared fresh daily (for real!)  This is the type of place that has the look and feel of a young/hip/fun place but the food quality and variety of a high end, up and coming joint!   This is the type of place that likes to try new and bold flavors together while incorporating healthy ingredients/options in their menus! Their specials are also something to look out for!   They've got various types of salads, delicous soup choices, a great deal of sandwich, panini, wrap, and burger choices! ** The salmon burger is really good!  If you are looking for a treat - they have another well-known chef that specially makes their chocolate treats, croissants, tarts, scones, etc. It is a wondeful treat to visit the shop during festive times as their dessert and treat options are geared towards the holidays and the shop is very nicely decorated!   They also do a lot of catering! So for office lunches or any type of party or gathering, etc. it is a great choice as all of their products are baked fresh!   I always check them out when I'm in the area for work! Unfortunately I do not work close or it would be where I get my morning coffee and breakfast/treat on the daily!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches instill a horror in me that most people find akin to finding a spider in their room. Irrational? Totally. Unfounded? Aside from a few too many PB&J's in elementary school, absolutely.  With that disclaimer, I will readily admit that sandwiches and wraps are not a few of my favourite things.  The sandwiches here look decent though, with fillings piled high enough between the crusty square buns.  The entirety of their menu can be found on their website (http://theeateryto.com/menu.html) but the menu changes on the daily so that you'll have only a couple options per each food type per day.  When I went yesterday, in the glass display case there was quiche, a couple pasta salads, a salmon cake in a bun, a sandwich which I can't remember for the life of me at the moment, plus two type of pizza: vegetarian and deluxe.  I chose deluxe.  Baked fresh in the oven on a thin crust, the pizza is placed into a cute, small, white personal pizza takeout box. Roughly 6\" in diameter, this pizza was definitely more on the healthy side than the greasy-box type.  To be perfectly honest, I found the crust a little dry.  I suppose that's the healthy part of it though.    There are prettily-packaged chocolates and small baked goods available by the window display, including a pack of two tiny chocolate bars dusted with edible gold dust and shaped like miniature gold bars.  Cuuute.  Drip coffee is plus tea is available for purchase here too, in case you're in need for a morning cup.  All in all, I still can't say that this type of food is what I prefer, but The Eatery is A-OK."}
{"text":"Amazing. I'm here once a week or so for lunch and its never failed to please. You can't find fresher ingredients anywhere. The salads and quiche are the perfect lunch. Service is friendly, helpful and quick. Would totally recommend this place if youre in the area."}
