Dostana Indian Cuisine is a small Indian food place located in Royal Vista (Royal Oak - deep NW). I wouldn't classify this place a restaurant, even though it does have some tables inside. It's more a food court/cafeteria type of place. Don't want to surprise people thinking you sit down and there is menus and table service. It's not that kind of place.You go up to the counter to order and the food is pre-made under heat lamps and ready to go. Same concept as a mall food court. Nothing fancy here! They have a small menu posted on the wall based on one or two items. I am going to assume by this concept, they mostly just do lunch since I couldn't see this as a great dinner option? Not allot of variety here. Usually in Indian restaurants, there is allot of options and variety. 

Not allot of food options and all options are over rice. Quiet typical but more options over rice is always nice. 3 meat based options in sauce and two vegetarian options in sauce. The prices range from $8 -$13 depending if you want one or two items. Simple concept.

Walked up to the counter and looked at the food on display. Without any labels or tags and everything in sauce it was hard to tell what was what? I asked the man working at the counter what each of the items were. He pointed what was what by the Indian names. Well, it would have helped me if he explained or at least told me what kind of meat it was or which items were vegetarian. Sorry, I am not an expert on Indian food or what everything is. I just know I love Indian food. He wasn't overly friendly and with only two of us customers in the whole place I wondered why he didn't take the time to explain? It surely wasn't busy here? I noticed they had Samosa's on the menu board and didn't see them out under the heat lamps? I advised I would order beef and veggie samosas to go. One order of each. This seemed to put him off. He advised me abruptly that it takes 20 minutes to make the samosas. I stated that was fine and could just sit and wait and catch up on some emails. He walked away to the back. He re-appeared a few minutes later to advise me they don't have any and no apology. What did I want instead?

Since Samosas were not going to happen and I can tell by the man's impatience, I advised I would have one of the vegetarian items over rice to go. Not ideal. I just wanted to get out of there. As I was paying, I asked if Nan came with the lunch combos. He advised me its $2 a piece. I said that was fine but in reality, why not just include a  piece with lunch? This is what I was thinking and surely did not say this out loud to him. Or maybe he could have offered it to me for free since they did not have beef or veggie samosas, which is what I originally ordered. He rung me up and I was a bit surprised it was $14+ for such a small lunch, but paid and got out of there.

The food was good. The service was MEH, not the greatest by the man working at the counter. The price is high for what you do get since it is food court type of atmosphere and not fresh ethier. For that price, you would expect more food or a real lunch combo. I had high hopes for this place (Dostana Indian Cuisine) and found it quiet disappointing on all fronts. I won't be back. I can think of plenty other places to spend my money at and be treated better. I also find it surprising that this place has been open for 8+ months and I am the first to review it? My neighbour who works in the area and the same strip as this place has told me that she keeps far away from this place. She has has a couple really bad experiences at this place and even knowing that, I had an open mind and thought I would give this place a try. I was hoping to prove her wrong! I really had high hopes for this local business."}
{"text":"I love having a quick Take out place on my way home from work. I usually get a box with rice and two items. 

Note: this is NOT a sit down service restaurant. It caters to people who want to grab something to heat up at home as they have a cooler with different items or a selection of pre- made hot meat and veggie items at the front counter.

Service here is very friendly as I usually pickup after work with my son. Our faves: kadhai chicken is the most tender breast meat with a flavourful sauce, veggie korma and daal (lentils). I have also tried curry beef and the butter chicken which are average. The convenience and price point make this great for a busy mom like me!"}
