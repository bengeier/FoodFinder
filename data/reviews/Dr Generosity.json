{"text":"Myself and a group of friends decided to check out this highly recommended eatery one Sunday afternoon for brunch. The moment we walked in, you could feel the buzz. It was quite busy, but we were seated right away. 

Each table was draped with a brown paper table cloth (similar to Jack Asstors style), with crayons for drawing. This touch made it a more family friendly place, as kids could draw while parents chatted with friends. I drew a tree : ) Underneath these table clothes were white linen, I'm assuming for when dinner rolled around.

The waitress brought out water right away, with a slice of lemon (without us ordering it) which was a nice touch. Most of us ordered coffee, which was served in a glass cup (very eastern European) and the large coffee pot was left at the table for our convenience. I found the coffee to be a bit on the watery side. About 5 minutes went by before the waitress came back to take our orders, a bit longer than usual, but not surprising considering how packed it was.

I ordered the Lisa's Bloor West Village Special (a.k.a. Kielbasa and Eggs) ($11). I wondered if the owners were Polish, as kielbasa is a polish style meat, but our waitress told us otherwise. Our meals came out 15 minutes after ordering. 

I wasn't too happy with my meal as there wasn't anything that excited my taste buds. Even though the portion sizes were generous, the scrabbled eggs were quite bland, as was the  kielbasa. I was expecting it to be drizzled in a spicy sauce or something to kick start my morning, but sadly to no avail. The table side ketchup helped here. The cream cheese addition to the eggs was a bit awkward and didn't add anything to the flavor. The potatoes were also quite bland with no hint of any other taste besides...potatoes. My rye bread was nice, but nothing on the plate complimented each other. The fruit was disappointing, with half a slice of melon and pineapple. The melon was lovely and sweet, but my pineapple tasted like meat (I had to spit it out mid way). The rest of my party expressed similar dislikes. But with this place being around for the past seven years (as our waitress divulged), it must be doing something right!

Our waitress only checked up on us once after receiving our meals; as I'm a huge water drinker, I kept scanning the room for her so I could have my glass re-filled.

Overall, the large number of people helped create a strong buzz to this place, however, the food wasn't the best and the service okay. Total bill for the two of us, $30."}
{"text":"Always good food and good service. Have eaten here 20+ times in the last two years and have never had a bad experience. Try the chocolate martini."}
{"text":"Love this place, been a regular since it opened. Casual atmosphere with great food, from burgers to steak, pasta to seafood. Nightly features and desserts.   We've been for brunch, lunch and dinner, but I think brunch is my favorite, my usual is Eggs Dostoyevsky. Splitting a sandwich with their delicious Mushroom Soup is a regular thing for us in the colder months for lunch. If you haven't been, I'd recommend giving it a go,"}
{"text":"The Grilled Vegetable and Goat Cheese Salad is really yummy. The salad portion they offer is huge. I mistakenly added calamari to the salad once and they were pratically falling off the plate. Way too much food. They serve the goat cheese as a full round- about the size of a hockey puck. Pretty Legit. 
A fun, casual spot and the prices are on the mark."}
{"text":"Brunch here is pretty good... only so excited I get over an egg...but dinner here is fantastic. I've never been disappointed and the stuffed sole is my favorite. The \"just what the doctor ordered\" martini is my favorite as far as drinks go. If you've only been here for brunch, try it another time as the menu and specials keep changing. Yum."}
{"text":"I love the brunch of Dr. G's.  The huevos rancheros are the best I've ever had and the stuffed french toast is always delicious. The homemade hot sauce they serve with the huevos is yum! My only complaint from my last visit was that the caramelized pecans were kind of clumped together and when I tried to break them up, a chunk went flying Pretty Woman styles and landed by the woman at a table next to me."}
{"text":"Mmmm. I love brunch!

I went here with a group of my friends and was so happy at how good it was.  My friend who's from the area hyped it and it did not disappoint.

I had the Eggs Florentine and it was delish!  It came with homefries and fruit.  Yum!  Topped that with a Caesar and you get brunch heaven!

The service there was great as well which really makes brunch all that better.  I hate brunch places with bad service.  It's already early on a Saturday (anything before 1pm is early to me) and the last thing I want to deal with is attitude.

I was lucky to go there with no lineup.  YAY for no lineups!

Overall - I enjoyed it and would go back."}
{"text":"I have only been here once, a while back, but I remember the food as being surprisingly tasty. Staff were nice too. The atmosphere is a bit stuffy - my only complaint."}
{"text":"It's cheerful and down-to-earth, but still has a stylish atmosphere. They used to have good daily specials stencilled right on the front window, so you couldn't miss 'em; now they have bring-your-own wine corking fee specials, which might save you more money anyway. 

Of course, they still have interesting specials, and the regular menu is tasty too. Great brunches, especially for Mothers' Day, although if you go then, you'd probably be smart to make reservations, because it's quite popular."}
{"text":"The ambiance was nice. This places seems to be really popular for brunch and lunch.However, I thought the food was overpriced for what it was. 

The lamb burger bun was not fresh and the burger itself was not that flavorful. I was also expecting some more creativity with the fixings for the price I paid.  

The soup of the day side I ordered was as basic as you could get. It tasted like canned soup with lumps of shredded cheddar cheese in in.

In summary, this place has food on par with a chain casual dining restaurant but charges more. I  would not go out of my way for this place."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that DR. GENEROSITY ROCKS!!

Now that that's out of the way, let me tell you why with the GOOD:
- The Huevos Rancheros are *delicious*. DELICIOUS!!
- The eggs were perfectly poached with yolks that weren't too hard or soft
- The home fries were divinely flavored
- My friend and I split the daily french toast special (prepare your salivating glands): Banana Walnut Bread with candied walnuts, sweet creme anglaise and blueberries, served with maple syrup. One of the best things I've ever, ever, ever put in my mouth!
- I went on Valentine's Day and they had dropped a handful of cinnamon hearts on each table. Awww!
- The service was top notch
- The prices were reasonable
- THEY KEPT MY WATER GLASS FULL!!

The very few NOT SO GOOD:
- We got there just in the nick of time -- a long lineup ran out the door around 12:30pm
- The small, round high tables at the front of the resto are not where you want to sit -- there is far too much traffic up there to enjoy your meal in any way

Just like their tagline says, Dr. Generosity is *definitely* my prescription for great food! Make the trek out to Bloor West Village as quickly as humanly possible to eat at Dr. Generosity. This may just be my new favorite brunch place in T.O."}
{"text":"Close to where I live and we have eaten there countless times over the last 5 years or so. I'd say it's easily the best place in Bloor West Village. The food is good, the portions large, almost too large, and the service is great, friendly and prompt. So we are regulars. Not a good place to go though if you want a quiet meal. Generosity's is crowded, noisy and boisterous. A fun place; and you can bring your own wine most evenings for a very modest corking fee. My only complaint: the menu hardly ever changes. I say check it out, you can hardly go wrong."}
{"text":"Not a fan.

I work next door, I'm always trying to like it. Honest.

The nachos are terrible. Flat out bad.

The macaroni and cheese is alright. Totally edible. But pretty bland. 

And the owner (or manager?), if he is a doctor of generosity, he certainly isn't a doctor of kindness. He's always scowling and kind of unhelpful.

Miss it."}
{"text":"Busy place on the weekend but Dr. G's is well loved by the west end for a reason. We frequent this place for lunch; I almost always get a tuna chop salad. It sounds like such a boring order but, seriously, an incredible salad. Get it with lemon basil vinaigrette. The sweet potato fries are awesome too."}
{"text":"Bloor West Village, where Dr. Generosity is located, is a neighborhood that's dominated by young families.  And \"Dr. G\" (as locals call the restaurant) caters to its dominant demographic -- kiddie menus, Bumbos, high chairs are readily available.

The food is primarily comfort food.  Starting with brunch, you get generous portions with solid, consistent quality.  The varieties of egg benedicts are popular.  The dinner is hearty, usually some tasty specials for most evenings.  My favourite is the Liver and Onions plate with a side of sweet potatoes.

It is a crowded restaurant.  Expect a long line-up for weekend brunches.  Dinner is the same way, but they do take reservations.  Unfortunately, my last visit came with a 30-minute wait despite a reservation made 3-days in advance.  There's no waiting area except the bar up front, which is usually crowded.

Overall, it's a comfortable and warm place to dine with your family.  If you bring a first date, be prepared to have an uncomfortable conversation about your appetite for kids in your future."}
{"text":"I really disliked my dinner here, which is sad because I've been hearing good things about Dr.Generosity. 

The menu has a  huge mix of big salads, meat, and a lot of over-priced pasta dishes. There aren't very many vegetarian dishes, aside from a veg lasagna, which didn't interest me, so I just ordered the grilled vegetable salad. I've heard good things about their big salads, and a few tables around me had ordered them, so I was expecting big things. I don't think I've ever had a salad I didn't like - this was pretty awful. It was a mix of greens with  diced, small, mushy pieces of eggplant and zucchini that tasted like they were soaked in vinegar and fried or boiled - something was not working. I picked around the vegetables - a few small orange pepper pieces were OK, and stuck to the greens. It was awful - don't order it! 

My friend ordered the veal and pasta, which he seemed to enjoy. The portions are quite huge, which is nice, considering the prices. 

The brunch does look good, so maybe I'd try it again for breakfast, but I'd pass on dinner.

Also to note: the restaurant does seem to be good for families. I haven't seen that many kids in a restaurant in a long time. Staff was friendly, decor was nice."}
{"text":"Went here for new years brunch with our group of 8. Everyone had something different. I had the Eggs Benedict with Crab. Very different but a good combo. Home fries were perfectly cooked. Eggs done right. Bearnaise sauce was infused with a hint of Dill.  All in all a good spot.

Table for 8 was at the back by the washroom and kitchen. not the best. Better to have large parties closer to the center or front. But other than that a great little spot with appropriate line ups.

{"text":"I went for dinner tonight with my family. My mom order some sea food special for an appetizer, she felt that it was not cooked properly and it smelled horrible. She let the waitress know and she went and told an older lady with white hair (manager? Owner?) she marched over to my mom and very rudely told her that it was cooked properly and she tasted it herself. My mom disagreed and then she continued to argue about it until I butted in and told her, the costumer is always right and to stop arguing with my mom! It was unbelievable!! The rest of the dinner went well but it is 4 hours later and my sister has violent diarrhea and vomiting! She had a sea food pasta... I told her to call the health department and collect a sample for them to analyze. Thankfully my mom refused to eat the seafood dish she was served! That white haired lady's attitude was already enough for us to never return. She should be fired."}
{"text":"I am not your pompous artsy food guy. I am a regular guy who likes good food and good service. I have been here a couple of times as buddy lives around here. I was very impressed at the portion sizes and the service. So many places you go you get very little for very much. I found the portions well above average for Canada no US!! The service was great but not excellent as it seems to be busy every time I went. Overall great place to go and sit with friends and have a great meal."}
{"text":"Brunch is my favorite meal of the day. So I had high expectations going in. Happy to report I was not disappointed!

My salmon eggs benny was good but my SO's pulled pork eggs benny (their special today) was divine. Service fast and friendly. Ambience is great too. 

I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"So my friend also wrote a review about our great time at Dr. Generosity this weekend - I wasn't going to be a copy-cat but I just have to say...
...THE BANANA BREAD FRENCH TOAST WAS AMAZING!!

As another reviewer said, this was a reverse commute for me (and it involved getting discombobulated on the subway on a Saturday morning) but it was definitely worth the trip out to the Bloor West Village.

As you can see from above, I had one of the specials - the banana bread french toast (with sausage - also tasty, homestyle). I was also happy the be served a generous portion of real maple syrup with my order (I am a maple syrup snob), but as I turned out I didn't need it - the toast was great without it.

The service was also great - the guy was definitely friendly and attentive - and he was also great at getting the family behind us settled with their small children. The food also came out warm, all at the same time, and  in a timely manner - this is a trifecta I can imagine is difficult to accomplish on a busy Saturday morning for a brunch spot.

Overall - I definitely want to go back...now...hopefully remembering to get off at Runnymeade this time :)"}
{"text":"Their Eggs Dostoyevsky (smoked salmon benedict) is my favourite brunch item in the city. The huevos rancheros is also quite good. I'm not a coffee buff, but I like their coffee compared to most restaurants. Service is always good. 

It's a bit pricey, and I've never been as impressed with a dinner here."}
{"text":"I've just visited Dr.G's for the first time and I loved it! 

The service was great, greeted with a smile and although we stayed a good half hour after close (oops sorry!) they didn't seem to mind at all 

Now more importantly the food. Amazing! Their chili cheese nachos had the perfect proportions of chili to cheese and beans to meat. Most places where I order nachos I'll get to the bottom with left over chips and still hungry. Between my friends and I (who are both big eaters) we finished the whole plate and both of us were stuffed. Never have I ordered just nachos and been full, so hats off to you!!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Saturday around noon. They don't take reservations and the wait was at least 30-40 mins for a table of four. 

We got the
1) Eggs benny special - eggs benny on bbq pulled pork and jalapeño cornbread. Good but not great.
2) Huevos Rancheros - 2 poached eggs on a grilled tortilla with sour cream, house hot sauce and guar. I loved every part of this dish! 
3) Side of sausage was also very good.

Service was spotty but understandable considering that they were packed busy and the food made up for it! I'll be back again when I'm craving the huevos :) 

P.S They also have really tasty apricot ale on tap!"}
{"text":"Great food, cozy! I've been many many times for brunch, lunch and dinner. You can't beat $1, $2, $3 (Mon, Tues, Wed respectively) wine corking fees. 

My favourite is the grilled beef salad or the tuna sandwich, the liver is actually really really good. I've never ordered an entire meal of it, but always take a bite from someone else who has ordered it. All their brunch options are amazing. 

It is a great place to bring kids, they take good care and are very patient with them/us.

Ask for the gallery seat when being seated... it is such a treat! Only for 2-3 people tho."}
{"text":"This is my Sunday Brunch Place. It delivers. 

Busy, yes. A couple spots in the front bar are my fav. Biiiiig Room in the back for lots of people too. 

Okay for breakie, it's not your cheapest bet. But I'm here for Quality. Coincidentally, Quantity is there too. 

My staple is a large freshly squeezed OJ, and whatever Eggs Benny Special they've got on that day. The home fries are amazing. A simple thing that surprisingly can fail, but they do not here. 

The special will put you back about $13-15 bucks. Worth every penny. 

I've always had great, attentive service. See you next Sunday!"}
{"text":"Great brunch! We have compared all our other brunches to the one we had here..... But nothing has come close! The prices are very reasonable and the service is great!"}
{"text":"People are always talking up the Doc. 

Took a while to finally get around to going and was initially impressed with atmosphere inside. It was dark, cozy - but still had a family-restaurant vibe. There were a few dates in at the time - so it's not quite East Side Mario's.

The portion size was very large, the prices were a little too high, and service was so-so. Food was....OK to slightly not that OK. Had a veal parmigiana which came with a tasteless side salad.  Pasta could have been fresh, but I doubt it. Tomato sauce was very plain but a good consistency. Veal was better than an Italian sandwich place - but not that much.

Bill for two was about 50 bucks. A little much for a meal not great. Could have done a lot better (out of the neighborhood, for sure).

Interesting item: Lemon Hopper: Lemonade/Grass Hopper beer. Not delicious....but interesting. SKIP IT."}
{"text":"Simply brilliant. One of the best brunches I have ever hard. Period. 
Tip: get there before 10am to avoid lines. Or go there midweek. Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, familial place. Cork fee is good from Monday to Wednesday (1-5$ max) and ridiculous thursday to sunday (15$). Layed back ambiance."}
{"text":"I have been going to Dr. Generosity for 5 years or so, and my most recent visits have left me wondering: what happened with this place?

Although I don't think it ever was a 5 star restaurant, it had solid options and everyone could usually find something they liked, and the steak salad was downright awesome.  However, in the last year something weird happened.  This place, which was our standby for the neighbourhood, became totally undependable.  The burger was different and overcooked.  The salads, which I loved, were served with wilted lettuce and weird dressings.  

I don't want to give this one star, even though I am thoroughly disappointed, but I hold on to hope that it will turn around and become one of my favourites yet again. And because I love to draw on the butcher paper on the tables."}
{"text":"This doctor has no bedside manner.  I'm sad to give this place 2 stars but based on the service I had, that's what it's getting.

True to the experience you'll have at a doctor's office there's a ton of people in the waiting room and they're just pushing you through.  If you're coming here with friends and you want to hang out and catch up be aware that when the meal is over, they want you out!  

I've been coming to this restaurant for brunch since it opened and know how popular and busy it is and the food has been consistently great.  We chose to come here to introduce a friend who is new to the neighbourhood to the restaurant.  We had terrible service, I was shocked, I've never had terrible service here before.  

I ordered the portobello sandwich and asked for it without the roasted red peppers and was told the kitchen couldn't do that, when I got it I was quite able to pick them all out so I don't know what the big deal was from the kitchen.  

The waitress didn't ask if we wanted to be topped up with coffee or tea before presenting the bill.  When we asked for more tea she looked pretty put out by the request but obliged and then back shortly thereafter telling us to pay the bill!!!  There are so many different ways the same message could have been communicated without being so rude. 

We asked to speak to the manager (who was working Sunday, Oct. 27th), and out comes a young woman who hears about how we were getting pushed out and how we had terrible service.  She apologized but I've seen better acting from Kristin Stewart in the Twilight Series.  It was obvious she couldn't have cared less.  We literally stood there looking at her in shock.  She asked what else we wanted.  I suggested a more meaningful apology considering this is a family business and customer service is important.  She could have committed to talking to the employee and assuring us that's not the experience that customers should walk away with.  She followed up by apologizing for her apology and saying that she couldn't commit to firing the server!  Neither of which is what we were asking for.  

When did asking for good customer service and being taken seriously as a customer mean so little?  Maybe she didn't care because there was a line up out the door.

If either of the owners had been there to witness that they would have been horrified.  I write that because I've seen them there in the past offering excellent service.  It just goes to show the power of two individuals, in this case the manager and server, can have a long lasting positive or negative impact on a business based on their individual actions.

Sadly the friend who came for her first time will not return, neither will we.  There are so many great places to eat in the city, why go back somewhere you're clearly not wanted."}
{"text":"If I didn't have lunch at Dr. Generosity on Thursday, I would have given it 2 stars based on my previous experience.  Had brunch there with friends about a year ago.  I can't remember exact details, but the service was simply lame and our server was very arrogant.  But instead of sharing my past experience, let me tell you about my most recent experience.  Simply put, it was great.

The service was outstanding. Food came quick and the waitress was very helpful.  My girlfriend had the beef/spinach salad and I had the portobello mushroom melt sandwich with the soup of the day.  I'm not a vegetarian, but that sandwich was delicious.  I also helped out my girlfriend with her salad.  At first beef was undercooked so we sent it back (wit out any problem at all), and when it came back it was just right.

There isn't anything all that exciting about the place, but it is clear that it's a safe bet if you're looking for your standard fare at a great price."}
{"text":"My first two times I had dined here were awful - bad service, crap food, etc. Then my colleague who used to work there suggested I go back. Glad I did because it's way better! Service is amazing and it's the best brunch I've ever had! Also their French Onion Soup is WOW!
Love the little bar in the front..and they do have an upstairs area for groups!"}
{"text":"Had 'brunch' here at 1.40p on Saturday and the crowd was manageable; pretty much no wait for small groups

I tried the French Toast, which everyone raved about...it was pretty good, but not fantastic...maybe my expectations were just higher coz it seemed like everyone DIED after eating it.
The sausages were surprisingly yummy and the hot sauce i requested for was actually Hot/ spicy. Nice.  

I got the mimosa to go with it. good combo. Reasonable prices. Fairly cute, cozy decor. Really cute name"}
{"text":"What is not to love at Dr. G's!? I love the place so much that each time my meal arrives I exclaim: The Dr is IN!

This is an establishment that clearly understands what constitutes good service and good food. Simple, healthy food without pretension. We go for the burgers, pasta specials and the in-house hot sauce known as 'Angry Sauce.' 

I will see you tonight for dinner, Dr.!"}
{"text":"Dr Generosity was one of the first brunch places I tried in the city - it might have actually had the honour of being the first, but heck if I can remember.  There have been many since, but something about it leaves me with a soft spot for Dr. G.  Maybe it's the fact that it's in my neighbourhood, maybe it's the daily specials... But it's got that something.  

I've been a few times for brunch and once for dinner.  For brunch, they have fantastic options, and there's daily specials.  I love when restaurants have daily specials, it still seems novel after spending so many years in small cities and suburbs with nothing but chains as far as the eye could see (slight exaggeration).  I've tried their Huevos Rancheros ($12), and though objectively they were really good, it was my first time trying the dish and I realized that it's just not my thing.  On another visit I was blown away by their Eggs Florentine ($12).  And you can convince yourself it's semi-healthy because it has spinach!  Score!  

For my one dinner there, I was a little surprised at the prices, they were a little higher than I was expecting though they certainly weren't outrageous.  All thoughts of that disappeared when we were presented with two delicious pasta dishes.  I had the Penne alla Vodka ($18) with smoked salmon and leeks in a rose sauce.  Absolutely fantastic.  And the good doctor lives up to his name - I had enough leftovers to take to work for lunch the next day!  My DC ordered the Chicken Tetrazini Fettucine ($19) and announced that he wanted to bathe in the sauce.  

All in all, great for brunch, lunch, AND dinner.  Decent prices, fun atmosphere, good waitstaff.  A solid choice that I'm sure I'll be back to."}
{"text":"I've Walked Miles For Their Breakfast

The interior of Dr. Generosity is very cozy with dark cherry stained wood decor, low lighting and warm service (the wait staff seems to be always *happy*).

And their breakfasts are hard to be beat.  The hubby and I go there occasionally as a \"reward\" for our 5K or more walks on early weekend mornings and not once have we made it before the long-line-up-nearly-out-the-door begins.  

I believe they do have reservations; but not for their weekend brunch hours.  They won't even allow you to have a table until your whole party has arrived, which makes sense with their limited seating, but has frustrated quite a few customers.  If you do try their brunch, expect to wait 10 to 20 minutes on average.

Is it worth the wait though?
If you're really in the mood for eggs benedict or french toast, then yes it truly is worth the wait.  Not sure about the rest of the menu, 'cause I don't believe I've tried anything else for their brunch.  

The stuffed french toast is roughly a third of a loaf of bread (not sure if it's homemade, but its definitely not Wonderbread!)  With different toppings every week, such as bananas and pecans, or mixed-berries, neither hubby or I have finished an entire serving of their french toast on our own.  

The allure of the eggs benedict platter has more to do with the home fries than the eggs for me (though they are delicious in their own right); I've tried reproducing the potato mixture at home with some success, but coming from a lover of all things potato (disclaimer: except *baked*, yuck!) Dr. G's version of breakfast home fries is pure gold.

I'll admit, we did leave once before being able to order. I'm not a fan of adult high-chairs (you know, the ones where you need a grown up to help lift you into them 'cause they're so high?)  Dr. G's has three of those type of seating arrangements at their front window, and I believe those seats are also used at their bar... Anyway, I tried sitting at one of their front-window tables for a breakfast, but my legs cramped hard and we left instead of waiting another 20 minutes for a real table (but that's more my fault for agreeing with the waitress to sit us there.)  What also wasn't all that pleasing that morning was the front door to their restaurant continually banging into the back of my chair as other customers walked in and out. 

I did mention the place was cozy right?

In essence, it's definitely worth trying Dr. G's for a weekend brunch, but try to stay clear of the front tables for two."}
{"text":"Wow what a disappointment. I've heard good things, but this place let me down on every level.  

Food was sub par, potatoes were underdone. Manager was rude and said that her main concern was making a profit which was a shock. 

Food - 4
Atmosphere - 6
Service - 3

Skip this place."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner and managed to land the best table in the house,according to the waitress, its a booth and leveled up higher than everyone elses. 

I loved the menu selection as well as their wine list. Definitely a good place for a girls night out or a date."}
{"text":"I originally gave it a 2, but +1 for good atmosphere and friendly people.
I came here for dinner, and after reading the reviews more carefully, realized their best bet is actually brunch. But i liked the atmosphere, like a small inn. We had two servers for some reason (maybe a shift change) but the 2nd one was really friendly and always cracking jokes. 

We probably were there for about 2.5 hrs, but they didn't care. The place was packed tho, with families and couples. I think it is a nice family place and was disgusted when a women winced as a baby cried. Anyhow.

the food. it was okay. we ordered the VEGGIE NACHOS. It seemed healthier than beef chilli (zucchini, peppers, and eggplant, mushrooms) with cheese and sour cream. The chips were good, but really really oily. 

We all got the BABY BACK RIBS, which comes with a soup or salad, and veggies or a type of potato (sweet, fry etc).  Salad was okay. The Mushroom Cheese Chowder looked really good.
The Ribs were decent, but I've had better. It didn't fall off the bone, and the meat wasn't as tender as I'd like. 
The sweet potato fries were okay, but lacked flavour. 

I also had the lemonhopper (wheat beer with lemonade) was really good. light, and citrusy.

I'd want to come try their brunch tho."}
{"text":"Consistency is one of the main ways I rate a restaurant. It's important to set a certain standard and continually live up to that standard one's set. Dr. Generosity is one of the rare places I've found that does just that.

Since the first time I walked through the door of this Bloor West Village restaurant a couple years ago, I've found it a hospitable place with a great menu. Add to this the friendly Doctor, Dr.G, who really cares about how his restaurant is run.

Their menu has a ton of variety, for kids, vegetarians, for everybody. My fav is their lunch menu (really a brunch menu) that lasts until 3pm on weekends. I usually show up with about 10 minutes left and chose from a tuna melt deliciously made with apples or my regular, Eggs Dostoyevsky (Eggs Benny but with Salmon). With a side of salad and lemon basil sauce, and a tiny cup of fruit salad, it's definitely a generously-sized meal, and always made with fresh ingredients. The caesars with horseradish are made just right too, every time."}
{"text":"I went there for Sunday brunch. Honestly, I was so excited to try a new place I couldn't wait. After carefully studying the menu we decided to order eggs Dostoyefsky  and Huevos Rancheros. Both of them come with home fries, french fries or salad. My biggest mistake was ordering home fries. They were so burned they actually were black. I was really dissapointed after all these 5 star reviews on Yelp.
I will give them 2 stars just because I liked eggs with salmon they were good."}
{"text":"--- Brunch on the Run ---

Perfectly executed Brunch items of Huevos Rancheros($12.00) & Eggs Dostoyefsky($12.00) with good service that has nice touches that can go unnoticed sometimes such as the staff hand-grinding Black Pepper at your table for Brunch.  I felt under-dressed as usually Steakhouses do this service for you.

Lemon Herb dressing was light and flavourful, put on the side as requested while servers top up Water at a selection of tables.  Hollandaise is nice consistency and flavour while Poached Eggs are runny yummy.  Huevos was a mess of the described ingredients that is fulfilling for that Sunday first Meal of the day.

You get to line-up inside which is better than other Brunch locations Downtown and the today's Tip is there is barely any wait if you settle for the BAR(!) area(Sportsnet on TV) like those Guys did, but obviously with the Ladies they always want that Mood light Wood Pub homey feel which provides more attentive service while they talk and you EAT.

Note: Kids get to draw on the craft paper covering the Table using crayons."}
{"text":"I love this place!  My favorite place to go for Sunday brunch.  The best eggs Benedict, served with sweet potato fries.  Awesome.  A mimosa to top things off equals an unparallelled brunch!"}
{"text":"This place is a good spot for brunch in the Bloor West section of town.  The food is good, but not the greatness that I hoped.  I had the banana and blueberry stuffed french toast which was good but not great.  My friend had the eggs and kielbasa.  It was also good but not great.  It was not terribly busy here and I thought the ambiance was perfect for meeting a large group of friends and catching up."}
{"text":"I'm always greeted with a smile when I come here--the owner knows me by name.  We are almost always seated quickly, even when it's busy (and it often is!).  Service is fast, unpretentious, helpful, friendly, and efficient.  I never feel like the servers are trying to \"up-sell\" me.  The food is always good--I come here almost every Sunday for brunch.  Nice portion size, child friendly, good service.  Thanks, Dr. Generosity!!"}
{"text":"I live in Bloor West Village and I've been going to Dr. G's for quite some time. My experiences are limited to breakfasts and lunches but I've always been fairly happy with the food and service. Definitely not worth 5 stars, but its a good spot to eat nonetheless."}
{"text":"This place came highly reviewed . 

Visiting from San Francisco (Yelp hq) I wanted to introduce the power of community to my Canadian friends. After quickly figuring out the location thanks to my GPS infused iPhone this place was on the top of my search results. 

We had two kids with us and 5 adults. This place is truly kids friendly:  no-spill kids cups, crayons and kids menu. Kids were thrilled. 

As a foodie I did not like the lunch salad that I got, it was blend and  humongous (seriously I thought it a cow portion of grass! and zuccini). 

I liked the portobella sandwich, that my friend got, and pretty much it.  

I left feeling heavy but missed the flavour and taste. IMHO

I bit overpriced too."}
{"text":"Used to eat here a lot, but went off it after awhile.
Food became the same, and was decidedly 'okay', but not awesome.
Was too pricey to eat with the family on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I love Dr. G's. Took me years to finally go there, passed by it all the time but it looked so small from the outside, never went in.

Well now it is the go-to for my wife and I for brunch in the hood. Service is great, food is fantastic, usually no problem getting a seat (though we tend to go later than most), and just really consistent. Which is what I like in a brunch joint.

We've been there for dinner as well and the food was just as good as it always was, drinks were good, nice wine selection, and the cheap corking fees during the week make the whole package really attractive.

Cozy warm atmosphere, great service, great food. A staple in my life nowadays."}
{"text":"Pretty decent brunch place. Great atmosphere. Ordered the pulled pork benny and it was pretty good. It got really soggy quickly so while the first couple bites were delish, the last half was too wet. The cappuccino was really nice."}
{"text":"Great brunch spots that aren't rammed are hard to come by nowadays, and I'm jumping for joy after a friend suggested we have brunch at Dr. Generosity. I've been to this restaurant for dinner a number of times in the past and have always loved their specials and BYOW policy. Corkage fees are dirt cheap Mon-Wed and managable Thurs-Sun ($15 a bottle). I love that I have another reason to go here now. Last Sunday I tried the french toast with a side of sausage. A solid meal that didn't break the bank. My friend had a delicious looking waffle with fresh whip cream. The maple syrup was great. It's close to Runnymede Station, but for those who drive, there's free parking on the street until 1 p.m. Bonus!"}
{"text":"Dr Generosity came highly recommended by my sister in-law, and by a bunch of reviewers on various sites. We visited for the first time this year, despite having lived in the area for four years.

Our brunch was okay. The eggs benedict were solid, and the sandwich my wife ordered was 'filling', but nothing special. Service was really busy when we entered, and didn't attend to us for a few minutes. Even after that, they were much more concerned with the larger groups and we were rarely checked on for refills of coffee.

The one thing I do really like about Dr G is the interior. The old feeling wood interior was perfect on a cold spring morning,  and it definitely seems like a good place to hang out for a while. Especially because of the crayons they give you to doodle with on the dining sheets.

I'm hoping return trips, maybe during a less busy hour, might yield better results from the service. The food was just okay though, and I feel like the Sunset Grill across the street serves about the same quality for half the price."}
{"text":"Say it ain't so! After eating a large plate of splendid eggs benedict on Saturday, my server tells me the owner of this place is hanging up her apron after 10 years very soon.

If you see this, hurry to Dr. Generosity before it closes!!"}
{"text":"I had the french toast again today.......and I couldn't help but think, THIS IS FIVE STAR. 

So there you go."}
{"text":"I haven't tried their dinner menu.  We got here for a Sunday brunch around 1 PM.  Were expecting a line, but I guess it had cleared by then.  

The brunch dishes, while not exceptionally unusual, were tasty and very good quality.  Huevos Rancheros was not only delicious, but lived up to the restaurant's name - large and filling portion.  Good coffee and the other two people in my party enjoyed the place as well.  Nice service.  

There are a lot of families with kids here - generally well-behaved but if you don't want kids around take note."}
{"text":"This is what restaurants should be like.  I went for brunch on a Sunday at around 1pm, and it was quite busy but we landed a good table on the patio out front. By the way, I think the patio was the bomb. Inside, there was a totally different, and much more annoying vibe with crowds of people coming and going.
My fellow diners were tempted by the omelettes but as I had eggs for dinner the previous evening, I felt like something different .  I was stuck between a salad or a portabello mushroom melt with sweet potato fries.  I chose the ladder.  Also they had a good selection of draft beers, and mixed drinks.  Didn't look very closely at wine menu, but they had one so that's always a good sign.  
 The sweet potatoes were a hit!  They're one of those vegetables we don't eat nearly enough but probably should because of their great taste and nutritional value. http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2947/2
The mushroom melt was something else.  I like mushrooms, I like cheese, and I like bread so I assumed it was a safe bet I would enjoy the mushroom melt also.  However, it proved to be sort of overwhelming.   It was served on an Italian bread similar to a ciabatta, which was fine but the mushrooms inside were huge!  I mean hamburger sized.  The sandwich was hard to pick up, and basically just a giant mushroom with bread around it.   I was expecting like small mushrooms, goat cheese and bread in some sort of manageable harmonious blend.     
Anyways, if you've ever wondered just how much you like mushrooms it's a good test.  I ate sort of... around the mushroom, believe it or not.  But in my opinion the best part of this whole experience was the abundance of sweet potato fries to make up for the monster mushroom sandwich.
I offered some to my companions, one of which proceeded to get his own side order as he liked them  so much.  When we got the bill we were surprised to find that side order of fries cost $7... ouch.
Overall, I feel I would have been better served to order something more in the spirit of brunch.  The waitress mentioned one of their specials were waffles with blueberries and bananas.  Next time I would try something along those lines.  My companions seemed pleased with their eggs, so I will give this place another chance some other time.  
It felt like a good restaurant where they know how to cook the things on their menu competently.  In the suburbs we would go to like an East Side Mario's or something to be guaranteed a half-decent family meal.  I would put this place in the same class basically, except it's in an urban setting, and not a franchise.  But it feels like you get the guarantee of a half decent meal no matter what you order there.  I enjoy places where you can try different things on the menu and know most everything is pretty good.
Not in a rush to go back, but if I'm in the hood and can't figure out anything else it's a good fall back.  The name has a nice ring to it: Dr. Generosity.  Easy to remember and right across the street from Runnymede station."}
{"text":"The reverse commute.   Heading away from the downtown core and it's plethora of spectacular restaurants.

It's not often that a place has the culinary magnetism to consistently BOTH draw urbanites out to the mid-city AND keep their tastebuds sufficiently on-their-toes to keep drawing them back.

There's a reason that this place is so damn popular.     It's remarkably consistent, emotionally pleasing and fantastically delicious.

One of the best brunch places in the city.    Incredibly easy to get to on the subway line.   Always worth it."}
{"text":"I have only had brunch here once: salmon bennie and a ceasar.  It was ok, not bad, not great, just ok.  The lines on the weekend are a bit ridiculous, but the service is fast and friendly.  

I'd recommend it, but I feel like there are way better brunch places out there.  However, if you're in the area and want something more convenient on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, this is probably your best bet."}
{"text":"I shouldn't have gone there. It's a trap. You see, I just wanted some eggs.. they suggested me eggs florentine... with a salad... and fruits. You see? And some orange juice. 

Then you realize you asked for a GIANT BRUNCH AND IT'S DELICIOUS, and you are unable to stop eating until you're licking the plate. At least it was Sunday afternoon and I could go for a lazy walk back home, and take a nap. I don't believe it's possible to eat there without having a post-nap. 

Their service is truly amazing, food is incredible (husband had the salmon option, oh yummy!) and they have a very nice patio. It's not a cheap place, but, hey, you can even share their brunch portions, based on their sizes - I'd do this the next time, so I wouldn't feel soooo guilty. 

I have to come back in a beautiful sunny day and try their huevos rancheros."}
{"text":"Great environment, eggs florentine was fantastic, good value too!

I went for weekday lunch, worked construction nearby.  No complaints here!"}
{"text":"I was at Dr. Generosity's last night with seven friends celebrating a friend's birthday.  This is one of her favourite restaurants and she and her boyfriend go often for brunch.

Our server was attentive and the food was good (though my mashed potatoes were dry, cool and salty).  Considering it was a Friday night and we were a large party, they didn't rush us out (we were there from 7 'til 10ish)."}
{"text":"Solid brunch. Had the bloor st west special (eggs, cream cheese, sausage) with a side of the house angry hot sauce (amazingly hot - thank you!). Wife had the stuffed blueberry banana French toast with sausage on the side. Both meals were massive and well prepped. Fresh squeezed OJ was great. Busy place so don't be surprised if you need to wave your server for coffee refill but service was still very friendly. One of the better brunches I've had in a bit. Cool woody almost cottagey decor as well."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a saturday morning after reading reviews of the huevos rancheros, and I have to say they completely lived up to the hype!  

 Beans, salsa, guac and a whole mess of ingredients hit my plate and left me so full i was feeling sick afterwards (in a good, over-satisfied way)!

My buddy has a traditional bacon and egg breakfast, which was also pretty good.

Plus we got a spot on their patio... which was tiny but pretty nice on a summer day.

Definitely worth checking out especially if you're a fan of huevos rancheros!"}
{"text":"Three and half stars for the food. 
Two and half stars for the service. There was  a sense of rushedness that made it very uncomfortable to enjoy our meal. They weren't outright rude but... I get it that you're busy, but.... it's weird how annoying it is for someone to constantly come by, and offer to take your plate away (One of our group hadn't finished her meal, while two of us had, and she was mortified..).  Once the last person finished, there wasn't any \"would you like dessert or anything else?\" type of questions, but rather, just the waitress plopping the bill on our table. I guess, we sure got the message - you need the table.  Really the quickest brunch ever :)"}
{"text":"I was really struggling when deciding whether I was going to award Dr. Generosity with 3 or 4 stars. The elements I liked were spectacular, but there were some missteps that just can't be ignored.

Let's start off with the pros since I'm in a peppy mood!  What originally caught my eye about Dr. Generosity was their sandwich sign out front boasting cheap corkage fees. I have NEVER brought a bottle of wine to a restaurant (wasn't even sure you could do that anywhere here in Toronto) and having just bottled some of my own wine at the Wine Butler, I was super intrigued by the concept! My friend and I went on a Tuesday, so there was only a $2.00 corkage fee! FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC! I almost felt like I was doing something illegal upon entering the restaurant and pulling out my own bottle of wine. My friend and I giggled like school girls at the sheer absurdity of it all (yes - we're dorks). 

We both ordered the chopped salad after hearing a woman at the table next to ours raving about it - we were not disappointed. The salad was plentiful and fresh with a delicious mixture of greens, eggs, shaved turkey (you can get tuna salad instead), cheddar cheese, bacon (though, I would have been thrilled if it were real bacon instead of those pitiful dried bacon bits), beets, carrots, alfalfa sprouts and cherry tomatoes.  It was honestly one of the best salads I've had and I was thrilled that there was leftovers for lunch the next day (tip - ask for your dressing on the side if you plan to do next day leftovers for obvious reasons).

The staff here were great. Very attentive and friendly. Our waiter was eyeing our glasses like a hawk and filled them as needed.  

Alright - time to get into the nitty gritty negatives.  When we first entered the restaurant, there were still many tables available, but we were seated at a wobbly table smack dab in the middle of the restaurant (so it was a high traffic area).  Seemed very odd to me and it was not at all a comfortable seating arrangement. Speaking of comfort - THE RESTAURANT WAS A BILLION DEGREES! My friend and I were sweating bullets the entire time we were there. Granted, it was a stifling hot day, but there is no way any AC of any kind was on. When we complained about it, they assured us the AC was on...in which case, they REALLY need a new one."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about Dr Generosity that I guess I had high expectations, but I felt like the place was pretty average.  They're a kid friendly place but the kid menu when we went for brunch was very limited.  The place was really loud and dark so I'd say not great for families.  With that being said though, they were very accomodating with strollers and kids (they give out crayons and kid menus) which was appreciated.  Brunch food was tasty, but not out of the ordinary.  I tried to make reservations and couldn't so the wait was quite long."}
{"text":"I find the food here is variable, sometimes scrumptious, other times just meh.  For the prices they charge, everything should be excellent, but not so. I have to say it's a really family friendly place that welcomes toddlers and babies and they have a clean roomy ground floor family washroom in the rear,  something not that common in the older buildings in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I've ever experienced at and resto ever.  They were not only careless and vacant, but also rude and arrogant.  We were perplexed and how rude they were.  Here's what happened:

They brought us the wrong bill, which neither us nor the waitress realized.  They charged our credit card for that wrong bill.  Then they returned and told us they charged us for the wrong bill, and said they needed to correct this and charge us for the right one.  We say \"sure\" and gave them back our credit card.  Then we asked them for a refund slip for the original wrong bill they charged us for.  They said they couldn't do that, and that they were very busy and they promised to refund the money to our card.  We responded with \"yes you absolutely can do that, and we need to be assured that we aren't being charged twice.\"  The owner very rudely tried to tell us this wasn't possible as \"they were too busy\"... REALLY?  So we told them to \"just do it\" because we weren't going to pay for their mistake.  He sent another waitress over with a machine and she refunded the money in less than a minute,, but was super rude about it.  I can't help but wonder, what the issue was with doing this in the first place, and why they had to treat us like such shit.  Can't really explain how rude they were, but I was pretty close to wanting to deck the owner, and I'm not like that at all.  We left very angry.  

Food is not bad, but nothing overly special.  However, I would never return their after being treated like that.  So many good brunch places in Toronto.. I would recommend Drift at Duff and bloor if you're willing to venture a bit east.  Excellent food, and excellent people."}
{"text":"Dr. Generosity, what a nice, pleasant surprise! Maybe I should not be surprise because I came here for brunch after reading all these 4 stars+ yelp reviews!

Advice: 
-If anyone in your group was whining that there is a line up and want to leave, ignore that person! They can go somewhere else but you are staying!
- Don't sit at the bar when there is a line! Wait for one of the tables in the dinning room! You really don't want to have 20 people lining up behind your back whining while you enjoying your brunch!

Love the nice, warm and classy dark wood interior... A nice and joyful vibe in the dining area.. who should not be joyful? The food here is awesome!

Huervos Rancheros! Yes it is really good! order that and you won't regret..and good call to have side salad instead of the potato.. as it can get really heavy with all the starch and meat and beans! (writing about makes me free like having one NOW!)

Eggs Dostoyefsky is as good too.. but nothing compare to the Huervos Rancheros!

Services here is friendly, attentive and efficient! My kind of place!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favourite meal of the day. When I'm sitting on a busy streetcar or watching my wet laundry twirl in the dryer, I fantasize about my weekend breakfast. I imagine a cup of hot black coffee and juicy bacon strips. I imagine a massive serving of smoked salmon draped over a poached egg like an elegant table cloth. I imagine the colourful fruit, the hungover faces and the bright glasses of orange juice. I love it all!

On my boyfriend's final morning in Canada, we decided that  a Last Breakfast was essential. It was a Wednesday and since Dr. G's is a 5 minute walk from my apartment, we decided to walk over. It was closed. To our unpleasant surprise, on weekdays they open at half past eleven. He recommended Tim Hortons but I distracted him at Chapters until the clock struck 11:30. Best decision of my life.

The server was friendly and took our order right away. While we waited for our food we drew each other with crayons on the paper table cloth. Some of my finest artistic work has been executed on restaurant napkins and pub coasters. Dr. G's tablecloths provide space for extra large portraits. Mine resembled a cross between a fat blob and a furry yellow animal with blue saucers for eyes. 

When the food came, I forgot about my masterpiece. I ordered the Egg Dostoyevsky with mushroom cheddar chowder. It was perfect -- the egg was perfect, the sauce, the toasted bagel. They served my meal with two slices of pineapple. I wish they threw in a couple strawberries or orange slices. A breakfast isn't complete without a serving of fruit! The chowder was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the tuna melt. He evidently loved it because it was devoured within seconds. It came with the soup of the day, which he also liked. I also recommend ordering the fresh and pulpy orange juice, especially when attempting to cure a hangover.

I regret not coming here more often. I've given many paycheques to the Firkin, which is right next door, completely forgetting that Dr. G's serves better food and bigger portions. Come here for food and go next door for beer."}
