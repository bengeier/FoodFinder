{"text":"A friend and I, after having a vehicle serviced at the local Avondale auto center, had an itch for Mexican food. Boy did we hit the gold mine! The food was excellent and the drinks from the Horchata to the Lemonade were equally as great! The Restaurant was very clean and the staff extremely friendly. The prices were reasonable for the large portions. I wish they were open later than 3, but for making everything fresh every day, it's definitely understood as to why. I  will absolutely return to this place very very soon, and would greatly suggest this place to any friends and family!"}
{"text":"I am from Guadalajara and this restaurant should change its name.  The food does not represent Guadalajara by any means. I feel sorry for the people that are mislead when it comes to mexican food."}
{"text":"I was so excited to check this place out because I'm a huge tamale fan and my Mom makes the perfect tamales so its kinda hard to find a good match. But anyways I came here today and and I ordered the # 6 2 tamale combo. I was shocked at how quickly my food arrived however when tasting the tamales they were very dry. I wanted to see if I could maybe add some sauce to try and moisten them up a bit but unfortunately 30 minutes pass and I never seen my waitress again. So by that time they were now a cold dry mess. After about 45 minutes later a young man sees me looking confused as hell and asked if he could help me. I then asked for a to go box And advised him of my experience there he apologized then refilled my water for me and bought me my boxes. Not so great service and I will not order the tamales again."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place this place is amazing I have chilaquiles rojos2 to 3 times a week they're delicious! I even call in my order and they have it ready for me by the time I get there"}
{"text":"Beware, The restaurant often looks closed, but it's not. The food was homemade and tasty. The staff is friendly. I especially liked the tacos dorado."}
{"text":"This is my first choice when I think of authentic mexican food.  The chilequilas, pozole, and cocido are the best.  The food tastes a little different each time, but always delicious. It's almost like eating at my grandmother's house."}
{"text":"A truly authentic Mexican restaurant with some of the finest tortillas around.  I don't live anywhere near Tolleson, but whenever I find myself in the area, I make it a point to stop here for a California burrito.  The tamales are excellent, as are the soups.  I've tried a half-dozen things from their menu so far, and I have been thoroughly impressed with every single item.  And the best part is that the cost is very reasonable.

If you enjoy trying new Mexican restaurants and find yourself in the Tolleson area at some point, you owe it to yourself to give Tamales Guadalajara a chance.  It's fantastic."}
{"text":"Very Authentic. Loved the ambience and the music played. Will definitely suggest it to others and would love to come again."}
{"text":"They have theeeee dryest tamales I've ever tasted in my life. Living in Vegas for years it's normal to see people going door to door selling tamales, as gross or scary as it seems I always bought some & you can always taste the love in their tamales. I sent my bf to pick some up after searching for tamale restaurants in AZ. Not only did they mess up our order, I ordered cheese & chicken tamales. The cheese was almost nonexistent in the tamales & the chicken?... Well unfortunately, I never tried them because they gave us pork!  ewwww it was so disgusting & dry. I'll never retry them again. It's a shame they call those tamales."}
{"text":"Really good Mex food. Clean spot and great service. Not as good as Mom's but does the trick :)"}
{"text":"Highly Recommend this little spot in the city of tolleson. Friendly staff,reasonable prices, breakfast lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Great food. Great friendly service!! Happy we discovered this place!! Had a California burrito (yummy) and a Asada quesadilla (wonderful) so far in my two visits. Can't wait to go back and try something new."}
{"text":"So good.  Taste just like mami made them.  So far the best tamales I've had in Arizona.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This is my third time trying Tamales Guadalajara and again,  not disappointed.  The atmosphere is cozy and nostalgic of Mexican heritage. We had the chiliqules Verdes, cheese tamale, and red tamale.the chiliqules is spicy and flavorful!I would recommend this place if you love spicy and delicious Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Food was good but nothing amazing. Had a tamale, chile relleno, and hard shell beef taco. The wait staff was very helpful and attentive. If I was in the area again I would eat here, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"We've had the tamales, pozole, menudo, tacos, green chili, machaca, chili rellenos, and just keep coming back for more. This is some of the finest Mexican cuisine in the valley. They have street parking in the front and a parking lot in the back if there is no street parking. Overall rating is a 5 for the large variety of food and drinks they have available to choose from."}
{"text":"I work around the corner from Tamales Guadalajara and we go about once a week for lunch. I think I might be addicted to their tamales. They're soooooo good! The staff is always courteous and the service prompt. Went one time around Christmas and they said they were out of tamales and I almost cried. :)"}
{"text":"This is a time machine that sends you to Guadalajara, wonderfully seasoned authentic Mexican food.  Great environment as well."}
{"text":"Amazing little spot, hidden in the small town of Tolleson. The guacamole is awesome! Perfect amount of spice and obviously made from scratch unlike some places. It reminds me of my own home made guac, so I must be doing something right!

Cheap and delicious food all around, it is my new favorite local mexican joint to grab lunch at."}
{"text":"Always great fresh home style food!
Must try if your near by. Great player size and the the service and super friendly."}
{"text":"The food is great and served hot and is always fresh.  Portions are large also.  I recommend the green chille dish. The breakfast is also great."}
{"text":"Found this little gem on Yelp. The food was delicious, but we went towards closing so they were out of menudo, posole, tamales, and horchata. Nevertheless, very good. Must go back and try again."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast burritos! Try the egg, potato, bacon and cheese burrito. Tastes like my Tia made it, if I had a Tia! But you get the point, their food is fresh and homemade, just like their salsas. 

I ordered to go and in no time my order was ready! Walking into this establishment sets off a vibe of authenticity. The ladies in the kitchen were friendly and I felt like I was walking into my best friends families home. It's a nice cozy restaurant nestled in old town Tolleson. 

Aside from the breakfast burritos, the other food I ordered was delicious too! The chiliquiles, the beans and rice, all was superb! Can't wait to comeback again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Best Mexican food I have ever had. Only down side is they aren't open for dinner. If they were I'd probably be here 5 times a week!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. food is very dry and bland. Least authentic Mexican food I've had in AZ.










Apparently my review isn't long enough so here are some more words so I can post this as a review and not just a TIP"}
{"text":"Ok I gave this place another chance. This time I had menudo. It was good but if you like it with hominy you must ask for it.  It was good.  My wife order chilaquiles and a tamal. This time the tamale was good and fresh.  We also order champurrado and it was yummy.  So yes, I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Happened to be in Tolleson today at lunch time and decided to give Tamales Guadalajara a try.  I definitely was not disappointed.  I ordered my favorite plate - a green chili pork burrito, enchilada style with sides of rice and beans.  The green chili was spiced just right and I love the fact that the burro was made with fresh tortillas and had cilantro and fresh onion in it!  It was wonderful!  The portions were so large, that I took over half the meal home for dinner.  My 1-year-old granddaughter loved the refries - she ate them all!  I'm an Arizona girl and love my Mexican food.  This is a restaurant that I would definitely go back to!"}
{"text":"Wow great place. Waitress was really nice and fast. I ordered tamales and she gave me her suggestion. Asked me a drink but I declined and she brought me some hibiscus tea on the house! Wonderful waitress she is, really! And everything was so delicious. Complimentary chips on the house with really tasty perfectly spicy salsa. Place was clean. Short n sweet this is the perfect place for a tamale! Oh and service is really fast! Tamales came out in no time!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food! Some of our favorites are the chilaquiles and the green chile plate. My husband and I have been going for years and have never been disappointed. Just be prepared for mainly Spanish speaking waitresses."}
{"text":"First time stopping by at this restaurant. Food was delicious, customer service was great, and the drinks were amazing as well. The Salsa Verde Chilaquiles con carne asada y huevos was amazing, spicy but not overwhelming. Looking forward to come back and try different dishes"}
{"text":"We went there this morning for breakfast, my hubby was looking to have some good ol' bowl of menudo, red. So we Yelped! and found this place. We've been here before, some years ago, and I remember having a pleasant experience. This time, with 2 more kids added to the mix, we headed their way in a rainy morning. 
The service was excellent, the staff is very friendly and helpful.
We ordered the Menudo of course, red, with toasted birote on the side, and we thought it was bland, it needed more seasoning.
#7 Green Chile Chilaquiles with eggs, rice and beans. This combinations is really good, more on the very spicy side, but tasty and very fulfilling, big portions. If you want to enjoy your breakfast, without having to deal with a runny nose, and burned tasting buds, then order the...
#8 Red Chile chilaquiles with eggs, rice and beans. Very yummy, big portions, and the sauce is more subtle, but still has a hint of spiciness you can deal with.
And then the regular scrambled eggs, with bacon, rice and beans.
Overall, it is a good place to go to, but I can't say it's my favorite, or that something there is to die for, it just good."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, & the tamales taste homemade!  I ordered 4 dozen 2 days before Christmas and they didn't tell me no like another place did (now I'm happy i was told no by the other place!) Otherwise I wouldn't have found this great restaurant that's close to home and they were ready for pick up exactly when they said would be......I'll definitely be back to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"These types of restaurants are a dime a dozen in the valley but based on their asada burrito enchilada style alone.....this one does it right.  They have the thick tortilla chips and salsa is excellent as well.  I'll be back next time I'm in Tolleson at meal time."}
{"text":"My wife and went to this place and the tamales tasted like they were in the  freezer for months,horrible, I recommend going across the street to irma's much better fast service. And the food is delicious"}
{"text":"Fantastic place, love this place and we'll be back for sure. Where else can you get coffee to go with your chips and salsa for breakfast? I really enjoyed my California burrito. Very large portion so I will enjoy it again for lunch too. Salsa is on point, tasty, spicy, but not too spicy, and just the right amount of lime. Great job, keep it up!"}
{"text":"Can I have a side of enchilada sauce. We dont do that. I'm happy to pay. No. Wanted more salsa, no one ever came back after they dropped my food. Stay clear. Food was okay, too many choices for Mexican food in az to put up with horrible service."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast and reasonable prices. I had the green chilaquiles with eggs and it was delicious but hot as fxxk! And my tolerance is high. But It made my ears ring. Red ones are really good too and not as hot. Tamales we're ok not impressed but then again my family makes our own from scratch. They tasted like they had been thawed out not freshly made."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch to try the tamales. The young lady helping me was nice but she had some difficulty understanding English, keep that in mind if you don't know Spanish. I ordered a large Jamaica and the chicken tamales lunch combo. The tamales were underwhelming, very dry and not much flavor. The beans and rice were ok, nothing special about them. The salsa that came with the chips was good (used it to give the dry tamales flavor). Lastly, the jamaica was very sour...unlike any jamaica I've had ever. Overall, seems like a cute mexican restaurant but with disappointing food."}
{"text":"If only they were open later they could easily get all 5 stars. They're a hidden place but definitely a place worth stopping at. Never a complaint as my food is always worth every $."}
{"text":"All I have to say is Oooooohhhhhh! I was so skeptical but I was not disappointed in anyway. Was better than I expected. The tamales were excellent not as much meat as I would have hoped for, but the moistness and flavor of the masa was on point. And the Menudo were do I start. I like my Menudo sin grano. And they accommodated me. Even asked if I wanted a pata Oooohhhhh it was delicious. This was Definitely worth the drive. And we will definitely be back. Great service too.:)"}
{"text":"I had passed by this place several time, so when I finally got a chance I was excited to try it. Ordered some menudo, it had nothing but meat hardly any hominy, also ordered two cheese enchiladas, they were dry no flavor like the sauce came from a can. Spent $12 to come home and throw it all away, so disappointed"}
{"text":"Food: 3.5
Decor: 2.5
Ambiance: 2.5
Service: 3
Value: 3

Expected more. The coffee was good, and we left full, but the food wasn't as flavorful as hoped."}
{"text":"This little jewel of a Mexican restaurant does not know what bad food is, I have tried many different menu items and all leave me wanting for more. Try the lemonade too, what a refreshing way to wash down all that tasty food. If you have never been try to make it but be careful as it only opens for breakfast and lunch so if you get there after 3:00 pm you will miss out. The excellent food and friendly atmosphere will keep bringing you back. - Tamales Guadalajara, food like the one mom makes at home."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food! And Tamales Guadalajara is another reason why. It's not just another ordinary beans and rice kind of place.

A co-worker and I had lunch here today based on what I had seen on Yelp! and it was very close to my mechanics shop where I was picking up my car. My co-worker is a closet foodie.

Some of the reviews here mentioned the salsa. Again, nothing ordinary about something as commonplace as salsa. It's not red. It's not green. It's delicious! Clearly homemade with some peppers I'm not familiar with.

I ordered the Machaca and it was outstanding! Did I mention homemade yet? The homemade refried beans were also wonderful with the chips. My company may have only ordered a burrito, but he enjoyed everything about his meal and was ready for a siesta afterwards.

I would love to come back sometime when it's not so hot and sit on the really nice rear patio that I saw and enjoy a cerveza. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the iced tea (only sweet tea is available) tastes an awful lot like Lipton instant tea.  Otherwise, this restaurant is more proof that you can have amazing, authentic food in simple surroundings, just off the beaten path."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for tamales and eggs for breakfast. So I found this place and though they don't have that combo in the menu, the waitress happily made it happen. She brought me chips and salsa. The salsa was delicious and the chips were homemade; yet they were too thick. She brought me the tamales which I ordered two pork and one cheese, came with a side of beans and rice. The best beans I've ever had in a Mexican restaurant. The rice had too much garlic but still edible. The reason this restaurant gets three stars is because, the Tamils had little filling and were too dry. Overall I will be back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now. Everytime I have been their it was for their tamales and chipsand salsa. Both are amazing. Definitely going to try other things from here. I would recommend to anyone that loves tamales."}
{"text":"Excellent food, probably the only authentic Mexican food in the entire state of Arizona, very friendly staff....Amazing food just like my grandmother and mothers cooking. I feel at home everytime i come to this place. The downside is they close at 3 but other than that i would give it 6 stars if i could. Food is cooked fresh unlike other restaurants who cook the meat early and let it sit for hours until you order. The owners are very friendly people too...Tamales Guadalajara should open up a second location !"}
{"text":"Good for a quick bite to eat. 


The food at Tamales Guadalajara has a authentic Mexican fare, with large portions. If you go to Tamales Guadalajara make sure you try the salsa and the guacomole, it's very tasty. 

On my first visit to Tamales Guadalajara my friends and I tried various menu items.   Some of the items we tasted  were the red beef tamales, beef flatas, rice, beans, chips and salsa.  I really enjoyed the beans and salsa. The tamales had a nice taste but they lacked filling. The Guacamole was delicious and their salsa was very good. If I were in this area again I would definitely plan a second visit.

 The staff is polite, courteous, and accomdating.  You will not feel rushed though they do a great job of getting your orders out to the table in a reasonable time. So if you are in the area, do yourself a favor and try Tamales Guadalajara, good food, reasonable prices, and great service. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Green chilli was good . lots of flavor . been here twice in the last week . only down fall brought my family for dinner on the weekend and they were closed check the hours before you drive out here"}
{"text":"Great service and Pozole soup!!! Isela did a great job, food came out hot and delicious!!"}
{"text":"Good green Chile Chilaquiles. I was disappointed with the red Chile burrito, tasted like marinara sauce. Menudo wasn't good either. It was thick and you can tell the meat wasn't washed thoroughly. I give it two stars for the chilaquiles and the cheese tam"}
{"text":"Salsa had a nice heat to it.  Chicken tamale and enchilada was delicious.  Waitress recommended spicy green sauce enchilada style for both.  Great spice, still feeling the burn.  Delicious. Service could be better, no one came back to refill drink."}
{"text":"Tried this place because the reviews it fell short. The tamales are bland the other food was just ok. The good things I had are the salsa and horchata."}
{"text":"Wow! Good food. Small hole in the wall place, but nice & clean inside. Awesome street tacos & green chili."}
{"text":"Once again Yelp has not steered us wrong. The service, food an prices were fantastic. My wife ordered the California breakfast burrito and reluctantly gave me a bite. Big mistake because it was better than mine. My chorizo and egg burrito was also pretty great. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"From many positive reviews I was very hopeful....but unfortunately this place is not my cup of tea....
The red enchiladas gas a weird sauce almost like marinara....very red and kind of sweet....chips were very thick and not warm ...but on the positive note the carne asada taco and Chile Relleno were decent!!!...we came here because my Latin husband loves Chilliquilles...he was very happy....just note they don't have fountain sodas so you get a can of Coke for $1.65.!!!!
...of course no refills and my waitress never refilled my ice tea...again not a bad place just not for me"}
{"text":"So here is the deal. In the phoenix area you will find plenty Mexican food however this one is different.  Here is why. Most the Mexican food you find in Phx has a northern Mexico/Sonoran influence which is good but it is different than central Mexico.  This is one of the best authentic central Mexico restaurant. If you don't believe me just try the Mexican enchiladas with chicken and green sauce.  Don't forget to ask for avocado.  You will not be disappointed.  Your welcome!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 4.5. The chips and salsa - to die for. Beans and rice - sooo flavorful! Tamales - YUM! Loved everything about this place."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic breakfast -- the red chilaquiles were perfection. My breakfast companion had a pork tamale on the side and proclaimed it \"the best tamale I've ever had.\" Friendly service, and good coffee too!"}
{"text":"Great food!! This place makes several dishes that remind me of home. The camarones a la Diabla are amazing (very spicey so be prepared) and the Cosido (beef soup) tastes like mom's! Enjoy lunch here. Service is not the beat but not bad at all. Its all about the food with this one!"}
{"text":"Charming little restaurant.  Chips and salsa are good and the staff is friendly.  What I'm basing my review on is the amazing tamales.  My family and I are in love with the tamales.  The beef tamales are excellent as are the cheese which come with two different types of chiles in them.  Coming from Southern California I can tell you I've had my share of tamales.  This place is the best."}
{"text":"Drove over here from Goodyear, due to the unusually high rating.

I was extremely hungry, so I ordered some type of carne asada breakfast with eggs, beans, and rice.

I also ordered six tamales: 3 chicken and 3 beef.

The breakfast was okay, but very rich in flavor.  I probably ate too fast, because it almost made me sick.

I suggest eating slower.

The tamales, on the other hand, hardly had any filling, were very dry and bland, and just plain awful.

With a restaurant that has \"tamales\" in the actual name, you would think that these tamales would be made with rainbows, unicorn magic, and golden fairy dust.  In reality, their tamales are the worst I have had since moving to Arizona.

If you go East a few blocks, Fuego makes MUCH better tamales.

So, I gave these guys 3-stars, because their service was good and the breakfast was decent."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food!!! The chilaquiles red or green are my favorite.

Good coffee!!!"}
{"text":"Located in a big strip mall, I was surprised by how many people were here on a Sunday morning. I had the egg and carne asada breakfast and as a girl who lived in Arizona most of her Iife. This is one of the best breakfast burrito I've had."}
{"text":"I go to this place every few months. Their carne asada burrito is delicious. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. Chips and salsa wonderful.

My only complaint is it was the tamales that brought me to this place and they are dry and tasteless. I've tried all of them and over multiple visits (they are affordable to add to a meal) but I've never had a good one. I've even brought friends and gotten their opinions and no one has liked the tamales.

So I don't get that part. They are known for their tamales, but I'd never go back here for tamales. The rest of the food - yes. Tamales no."}
{"text":"I ordered three dozen tamales (chicken, beef, pork) and the flavor was great! However, I felt there was too much masa, not enough meat. The meat that was there was good, but I wish there was more. Great customer service, and tamales were done on time as scheduled."}
{"text":"Surprise suprise ... excellent little place .. tasty child verde plate with great green sauce ..."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! I am a native from Guadalajara and this place has the food down to the spice!! Very flavorful and very spicy!! Just the way it should be. I had the chilaquiles verdes, just the right amount of spice. The salsa that comes with the chips is also delicious. If you like spicy you'll love this place. Will bring my friends here definitely...Ai Jalisco no te rajes!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Loved this very authentic mexican food.  The waitresses are friendly, but it's obvious that english isn't their first language.  It was very nice that a 2nd waitress came by to confirm our order.

Only negative comments are that we asked for ice tea and instead got sweet tea.  Also, the 2 baby highchairs we looked at had broken straps.  Otherwise, it was great.  I'm sorry I hadn't tried this restaurant sooner.  I can see why it has so many positive reviews.  I think they may be open only for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"been to this place 2 times and like it.  always friendly staff and fast service.  i had the taquitos the first time and really liked them.  the combo comes with rice and beans.  the second time i ordered the beef steak and liked it too.  think and juicy with rice, beans and tortillas.  reasonable prices.  will be back."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while searching for Mexican Restaurants in Goodyear, AZ. Happy Tolleson, AZ restaurants appeared. My fiancée and I don't regret coming here and plan on coming back to try different dishes. Free chips and salsa and started our meal off. The salsa was outstanding. We ordered the red chilaquiles with over easy eggs, and the two plate combo of 1 enchilada and 1 tamale. The red chicken enchiladas and pork tamale were seasoned very well and tasted fresh. Same can be said of the chilaquiles. The staff was quick, friendly and accommodating. They also do a great job of keeping their restaurant clean."}
{"text":"Visited Arizona for a week and came here for breakfast. I ordered the machaca and it tasted just like the one my mom makes :) staff was really friendly and fast. I would suggest stopping by!"}
{"text":"Food was bland compared to other Mexican food. Not to mention the tamale quite literally sucked all the moisture out of my mouth. Beyond dry. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Very clean place, great lemonade, good pork in green chile sauce. Tortillas were the downside....not homemade, but other than that the food was good."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food!! Everything is homemade and delicious. I highly recommend it for incredible food."}
{"text":"Great food. Very rare that I eat at any Mexican food restaurant (since I'm Mexican and can cook) but this place is amazing the food taste just like home. We were all satisfied with our choice. The tamales were nice and moist. The Camarones where drenched in a spicy but super delicious sauce. Nopales con costilla de puerco were very rich in flavor and tender. Enchiladas with green salsa were full of flavor the sauce was perfect not to spicy yet with that extra kick. I will definitely recommend this restaurant they close at 3pm. New spot when coming to Arizona."}
{"text":"Not only was the service great but the food was just as amazing! The tamales were authentic and everyone I went with was very happy with their food. This is now one of my fave spots and I will be back asap!"}
{"text":"This was pretty close by & reviews looked pretty good. Can't say it was not good but have tasted much better. I got a combo plate. I liked the street style beef taco, & the chili rellano. Since it is named for tamales I thought I should try one. I was very disappointed. Maybe too late in the day but did not impress me at all. The beef burrito was ok-  The waitress was nice. Would not come here again but with heavy traffic I was glad it was fairly close to us."}
{"text":"This place never fails. We love all their breakfast especially their green chilaquiles and posole! Super friendly staff. I love love love this place! Highly recommend their breakfast."}
{"text":"Never been here, looking for a go to spot in our new home town. Passed this place a few times decided to give it a go. So it's a little crowded, kinda divey. The staff are very friendly. The chips seem to be homemade, salsa was ok pretty mild but nice flavor. My son got a bean burrito no doubt, it's all he ever orders. The husband got menudo, which he was asked if he would like a pata (pigs foot) which he declined. The fixings came on the side of the menudo, onions, cilantro, and chili. I ordered the Machaca, comes with beans and rice. The beans taste homemade, the rice had bits of carrot corn and peas in it. Machaca had huge pieces of tomatoes onions and jalapenos. IMO everything tasted really homemade but nothing I'd rave about. The one thing I wasn't so crazy about is we all got our food separately differen't times. Over all we would go back but It wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Went this morning for brunch. I had a cheese tamal and a al pastor burrito. The food was ok. We are from Guadalajara so we expected more from this restaurant after reading all the good reviews. 
The tamales had too much masa and my al pastor burrito was too salty. My husband had the chile verde pork burrito and he threw it up about 30 minutes after eating. 

The ambiance is nice and they have nice decor. I don't think we'll go back though."}
{"text":"Do not get their namesake, Tamales!
Dry dry dry, tough meat and little flavor.
Wasted $15 for a dozen!"}
