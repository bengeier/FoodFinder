{"text":"We called in here with the Kids for a quick drink, located overlooking Whitby Harbour the view is great through the picture windows at the rear of the pub.    The pub itself was OK nothing great but I've been in worse we didn't eat here but the food selection was typical pub Faye and the beer was OK so I'll leave you to decide."}

{"text":"Situated near the bottom of the '199 steps' this was the perfect place to rest before walking up to St Mary's and the Abbey. We went through the door and headed straight for the stairs to the dining area which overlooks the harbour with a good view out to sea. I ordered Haddock, but was served what can only be described as a battered whale,...it was huge! The fish was about 12\" long and very fresh, served with thick cut chips and mushy peas, with a side of fresh crispy salad and coleslaw. I ate the lot, and washed it down with a pot of tea. The only downside was having to go upstairs to pay by card, but thats only if you're like myself and forgot to get cash first. I've eaten here a few times over the years, and the staff have always been friendly, serving nice food, and in a quiet little 'tucked away' place for a bit of a break from the busy streets above."}
