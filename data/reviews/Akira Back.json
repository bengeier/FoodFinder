{"text":"My husband and I dined here this evening and had the best time! Food was delicious, you get the quality you pay for and they have an awesome cocktail and wine selection with plenty of options :) However the icing on the cake for ya was definitely our server, Leif! If you want personalized service and great recommendations, he's your guy! We'll definitely ask for him next time we're back :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful night out! Stylish atmosphere and beautifully presented plates. Our server Lief was very helpful in suggesting items for our table. Every suggestion was bang on and we're so glad we allowed him to create an experience for us. Service was prompt and friendly and food was delicious. 

Great spot for elevated sushi experience. We'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I went in with a set budget of what I intended to spend for a celebratory meal. After going crazy on the menu, ordering things I intended to try, drinks, and a generous tip, the bill still came below my expected total.  

In this restaurant, you will get an Omani of different flavours.  Some items I want to highlight other than the MUST DO TUNA PIZZA

The unagi roll was delicious with a mixture of fresh and ocean eel.  For those who watch youtube and listen to generations of family own restaurant, these grandpas explain intensely why you needed to use both eels for the best unagi dish. I never understood it, until this roll.

My eye popped in the texture and flavour.  How can one little ball of rice provide a squish of flavour, yet melts in the mouth the same time?

The Truffle bomb croquette is a category on its own. It contains many flavourful ingredients, plus when was the last time you had a tempura fried uni? That is not easy to handle, without expertise hands. One pop in the mouth, you feel wave of the ocean smack the side of the head. I kid not. I made a large squeal of delight when my tongue hit this little bundle of joy.  

Great Staff. Great Service. I had many list of wishes to make my celebratory meal a success, and ask the staff for assistance beforehand. They were glad to assist, and made my night of surprises a solid memory of delights."}
{"text":"Had dinner there on NYE and it was a set menu, but amazingly curated. The tuna pizza was great and so was the sushi that had pop candies (I think) in it. There was so much food it was difficult to finish each course. The only disappointment was the dessert- not to my liking. The staff were very friendly and attentive. I'd go back again and try different items from their a la carte menu."}
{"text":"Food was great. One of their vegetarian rolls had mushroom and some pickled vegetable on top. It was a very refreshing roll if you are feeling for a lighter meal. I liked their taco appetizer as well, although it tasted more Korean than Japanese. Dessert was really great too.

Service was truly amazing. I mentioned we were celebrating for a birthday in the online reservation. We were feeling quite full and was trying to decide whether to skip dessert, our server was encouraging us to get dessert so we went for it. Later we found out that the dessert was complimentary when we saw the bill. How sweet!

Overall a really solid place for great food and ambience."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. 
Very romantic setting and GREAT food. 
Perfect spot to bring a date.
Everything was so different, the food was plated perfectly and the servers were so genuine and sweet. 
I got to practice some of my Japanese with one of the servers which was an added plus for me. But as for food I have been literally craving the tacos every day since I left. Those are the best mini tacos I have ever eaten!"}
{"text":"I had a terrible dining experience at Akira back. 

Visited the location with a small group (7 people). Our reservation was late - not a problem, we went to the bar downstairs to wait for a table. We waited 45 minutes and when we were finally sat we were rushed through our meal with the explanation that the kitchen was closing in 4 minutes. The server was efficient and knowledgeable but it the service was so rushed that our beverages came after four plates had been put on the table. My issue was that were our reservation ready on time this pressure to order without perusing the menu wouldn't have existed. 

I will say that the food was beautiful. While I wasn't a fan of every dish, everything that came to the table was beautifully plated and came out quickly. 

I would try this spot again but perhaps will wait until they have time to iron out a few of the service hiccups."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Saturday night to celebrate my birthday. Upon arriving, we were greeted with a glamourous golden staircase that led us all the way up to the restaurant on the 2nd floor. The restaurant was very dim-lit, very lounge-like with what-I-feel-resembles-like-an-aquarium decor. 

The service was excellent! Our hostess recommended a few dishes and explained to us how each dish was cooked and what made each dish good. We took her recommendations and tried their AB Wagyu Tacos, King Crab Legs and Tuna Pizza. 

The Tuna Pizza was our favourite dish of the night! Fresh tuna slices on top of crispy tortilla chip with yuzu aioli sauce and truffle oil. It was super delicious! My husband and I still were still talking about how good it was even days after. Definitely a must try! 

My second favorite dish of the night was the King Crab legs. Super flavourful and fresh. My only complaint was that the portion was small, only about 6 chopped legs for $32. The Wagyu tacos was also tasty as well. Crunchy taco shells ( I think they were deep fried wonton shells?) with marinated wagyu beef and tomato ponzu. 

That night, we also tried their filet mignon and this sushi roll called, Brother from Another Mother. We were intrigued by the creative name and we came to realize the roll consisted of fresh water and salt water eel, foie gras and ponzu aioli. At the end of the meal, our hostess brought over a slice of matcha mousse cake on the house for my birthday. It was lovely. 

The only drawback here was that the dishes were pricey for the portion you get. But overall, we really enjoyed the food and dining experience here at Akira Back."}
{"text":"It took me a while, but I finally found a sushi place downtown that was not a lunch counter, shack, or shop. This place is a real restaurant. The hostess and wait staff were all very polite and attentive to us (I went with a co-worker). We had 2 rolls, the Pop Rockin and the Hot Mess along with tuna and salmon sashimi. It was all 4s+, but they only let me give 4 or 5. The Hot Mess was the best, but the others weren't far behind. We both had a good cocktail to top off a great meal and ended it with the Cup of Chocolate (no explanation necessary). If you are looking for a sushi restaurant to sit down and take your time to eat, this is the place."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior and great service. I really liked the dim, dark atmosphere. Perfect for a secret rendezvous. My girlfriends and I really enjoyed sharing a few dishes like the tuna pizza, crispy rice, ab tuna tacos and salmon sushi. Highly recommend the tuna pizza. My least favorite dish was the black sesame cheese cake because of the lack of flavor.  The chocolate in a cup was great as were the cocktails."}
{"text":"Delicious food and accommodating of food intolerance - in my case gluten. The waiter advised of all menu items that were gluten free and doubled checked a few with the kitchen which is always nice. 
I came here as a party of two and the decor first off was impressive. The service overall was good, getting the bill was the only challenge. The food really is the highlight and was delicious. We shared the Alaskan crab, wagyu beef tacos, Una, and jidori chicken. All were so good and very flavourful. We also got cocktails - take my to Tokyo and Yasuke sour - both excellently presented and tasted terrific. The cocktail menu is extensive and there are so many fun concoctions. I would definitely return and try sushi - it looks really awesome as I saw a few other tables who ordered rolls. I highly recommend checking it out this place for a fun and fresh dining experience!"}
{"text":"Their signature rolls were definitely the most unique rolls ive tried yet. They were all delicious. Restaurant was also kind enough and gave us a salmon sashimi plate on the house! The cocktail was so good - i would get it again! Only downfall was when we ordered the bill it took forever when the place wasnt busy - waited for a good 20 mins and tried multiple times to get a servers attention to get the bill again"}
{"text":"TL;DR great food, service needs improvement, order the wagyu tacos and brother from another mother roll! 

Was just here today (02/13/17) and the food was amazing but the service could use a little work but considering this is a newer restaurant I would let it slide, oh and the food was amazing. Very clique atmosphere as it's down and obviously on the higher end of the food (restaurant) chain. 

I made a reservation for 6:30 to celebrate valentines days but I arrived shortly after they opened to drop off a little surprise for my girlfriend, I'm pretty happy that they tried to accommodate me with that considering I did not inform them ahead of time I was going to be doing so.
 
When we arrived at the restaurant we were asked if we wanted to check our jackets which was nice! After being seated we were given menu and asked what kind of water we wanted. The server did not rush us what so ever to order and only came to us when we put the menus down. 

We ordered the tuna tacos wagyu tacos wagyu fried rice salmon aburi brother from another mother roll and the 14oz ribeye

The tuna tacos were great as the tuna was fresh BUT the wagyu tacos that came promptly after stole the show, this is a must order when coming here. The wagyu fried rice was good and reminded me of teppanyaki style fried rice (a fair warning that it comes in a individual size bowl). I was a little confused when the salmon came as I was expecting pressed/torched sushi but that's my fault for not going thru the menu properly. The brother from another mother roll is also another must order item as this also stood out almost as much as the wagyu tacos! The steak came last but it was cooked to perfection (medium rare) BUT the sauce was a little weird in my girlfriends opinion, I thought it wasn't too bad could've went for something else though. 

Now to the service, I asked to have the gifts at the table upon arrival which to my surprise they weren't, wasn't a big deal. The service of the dinner was very choppy food came in very slowly in the beginning, we would finish something and would have to wait for another to come one at a time, it did pick up by the end but we were felt pretty hungry in the beginning :(, again it is a new restaurant so give them time and their service will match the quality of the food sooner or later :).  

Its unfortunate that they did not fulfil the way I wanted my surprise but all and all it was a wonderful experience and my girlfriend was still very happy with everything :). Would repeat in the future!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of my girlfriends for a birthday. Every dish we ordered did not disappoint. Some of my favourites included the wagyu tacos, tuna pizza, truffle bomb croquette, miso black cod, and seared scallop. But to be honest, everything we ordered was delicious with the exception of the uni tempera which was a bit bland. However, their service was top notch and all the staff were so friendly. One of the hostesses even helped us get a booth at the bar downstairs (Mister C bar room). Definitely will be recommending Akira Back!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful date night after work. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and accommodating to my date's gluten intolerance. Very romantic decor, without being stuffy. 

The cocktails were well balanced and exceptionally crafted. 

Only criticism is they forgot our wagyu fried rice...which we didn't realize until we were walking home. 

We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Initial thought: this seems a lot like Nobu

Came here to dine on a Saturday evening and found the restaurant to be less busy than anticipated, surprising for an upscale restaurant in Toronto. 

They interior was beautiful - dimly let and plenty of space between tables and our service was great. Our server was funny, attentive and knowledgeable with the menu. 

Highlights form some of the dishes we tried: 
- Tuna pizza: one of our favourites from the night; thinly sliced tuna on a cracker with truffle oil (yum!)
-  Wagyu tacos: although tasty, I found the presentation a bit odd. The wagyu was grounded making it difficult to assess the quality of the beef. If it was real Japanese wagyu, it seems a bit silly to dice such a high quality meat
- Protein roll: a different spin on a maki, this roll had no rice
- Uni & scallop sushi: this will be the reason I come back. The uni and scallop are amongst the largest and highest quality i've had in Toronto
- Seared scallops: we found the scallops to be a bit overcooked, you could skip this one

Final thoughts: this is a lot like Nobu. You are definitely paying for quality, but nothing too unique or elaborate to be excited about"}
{"text":"Akira Back restaurant is a Japanese fusion restaurant located on the 2nd floor of the Bisha Hotel. The restaurant is named after it's celebrity chef Akira Back who has a few restaurants around the world and was awarded a Michelin star for his restaurant Dosa in Korea.

Made reservations for two for a Saturday evening in February. The interior of the restaurant is very sleek, dimly lit and unique. Kind of reminds of a swanky/hip restaurant you would find in a high end hotel in Las Vegas.

The food is tapas style, so the portions are quite small and meant for sharing. We went with the Wagyu tacos ($22 plus tax), Jeju domi ($22 plus tax), Tuna pizza ($22 plus tax), Brother From Another Mother rolls ($19 plus tax) and The Hot Mess rolls ($14 plus tax).

Wagyu Tacos: Wagyu beef covered in a sweet bulgogi sauce in a crispy crunchy wonton shell was pretty good, tender beef with a Korean flavoured twist.

Tuna Pizza: This is a must order. It's one of their signature dishes. Thin slices of tuna on a baked tortilla crust drizzled with micro shiso, truffle oil and Maldon sea salt. Really fantastic tasting dish with flavours that mesh really well.

Jeju Domi: This is one of their signature dishes. It's essentially orange essence infused tobiko wrapped in slices of sea bream, and dressed with gochujang. This dish didn't work for me since the citrus had an overpowering flavour.

Brother From Another Mother Roll: It's two types of eel topped with foie gras and dressed with ponzu aioli. A pretty good and interesting take on a creative sushi roll.

Hot Mess Roll: It's essentially a sashimi poke drizzled in a ponzu aioli sauce on a cube of rice. Interesting flavours and well executed.

Service was pretty good overall and each dish that was brought to the table, we were given a description of what the dish was and what it entailed.

Overall, a pretty good Japanese fusion restaurant with a really unique and beautiful interior. It's a place where you would take someone to impress them, whether it was a significant other, a first date or a celebratory event."}
{"text":"Ok this place probably makes the best Sushi I have ever had. LOTS of vegetarian and vegan food which is great. Must-orders would be the eggplant miso and their seaweed salad (we ended up getting 2). I always order seaweed salads as a litmus test for Japanese restaurants and this one passed the test. The crunchy vegetable roll and the cucumber salad came in a very close second. 
Anyway, I ate a ton of food but it was so good. Will be back."}
{"text":"While considering the Bisha for my stay in Toronto, I learned about this restaurant.  After perusing the menu and reading about the Executive Chef, I knew this was going to be an indulgent and memorable meal so I quickly made reservations for dinner.

Getting to the restaurant as a guest of the hotel can be a bit confusing.  There was no signage in the elevator lobby when I got off on the second floor but luckily there was someone from the restaurant headed to a storage area that was able to point me in the right direction.   Upon entering I was immediately struck by another restaurant in the Bisha with dimmed lighting and loud music - but no big deal.  I was led to my table near the sushi bar and the kitchen.  

Service - excellent, but it got a little slower as the night progressed and the restaurant got busier.  I was there around 8pm.  My first set of plates arrived less than 10 minutes after I ordered them and my drink arrived inside of 5 minutes.

Drinks - two saketinis - it was refreshing, tart and very tasty.

Food - yellowtail serrano cold share was simple, but flavorful.  i love hamachi so this dish was awesome.

48 Hour Wagyu Short Rib - DIVINE!! Melts in your mouth. Rich and flavorful and so good. I slowed down on this one because I wanted to savor it.

Kim Chee & Bacon Fried Rice - I make kim chee fried rice at home all the time.  Akira Back's was very good, but greasy.  I wanted something filling and this was perfect.

Grilled Alaskan King Crab - LOVED this.  And the flavors were great.

Cucumber Salad - I used this as a kind of palate cleanser before my sashimi and it was exactly what I needed.  Refreshing and tasty.

Sashimi (Ama Ebi, Hamachi & Toro) - very fresh, cut well and the visual of the sashimi presentation was stunning!  Loved every bite.

I expected my bill to be higher than it was and kind of wish I ordered more dishes when I got my bill!  Loved my entire experience here and would definitely return whenever I make it back to this great city!"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this place. Obviously on the pricey end but the food was fantastic and very unique. Drinks we great and the customer service was on point. Hope it stays this way!"}
{"text":"I live close by and had to come try as soon as it opened and Akira Back did not disappoint.

There's a separate entrance to the left of the main Bisha hotel entrance. We were greeted by a hostesses in the elevator lobby, went up to the 2nd floor and they gladly took our coats for complementary coat check.

The restaurant is dimly lit and felt as if you were in a cave under the sea. I really enjoyed the dark furniture, the stone tables and spotlight above my table for photo taking.

Service was very good, the server was friendly, knowledgable of the menu and gave recommendations of popular items and even a bit of history on the inspiration of the dishes.
 
The menu is meant to be shared and for two people, it was recommended to order 4-5. We ended up ordering 5 plus dessert and left still a tad hungry.

Now, onto the dishes.. we mostly ordered from the recommended dishes and they were all very unique and creative.

Highlights of the meal were the tuna pizza and the waygu tacos. Both these dishes had an interesting mix of flavours and textures. 

The tuna pizza had a crispy crust with what tasted like an aioli sauce under the tuna. It was unlike anything I've had before and very tasty! 

Waygu beef taco was really good! Tender ground waygu beef covered with bulbogi sauce encased in a crispy taco shell. If you like bulbogi you'll like this.

The hot mess was a roll with avocado and crab topped with poke drizzled with spicy sauce. It was a decent but more so of an average dish compared to the others we tried.

Also have to mention that between the dishes, there were frequent cutlery and plate changed which was a nice touch. However, for a fancy restaurant, I would have preferred real chopsticks rather than the disposal kind.

We followed with the jidori chicken (the most expensive but also the largest portion of the meal) and the jeju domi ( smallest portion of the meal). The chicken was moist and cooked to perfection topped with crispy skin. The jeju domi, a signature fish was red snapper sashimi with tobiko rolled within infused with citrus flavour and chojang sauce.Realized that I wasn't a huge fan of the fish mixed with citrus but I liked the textures of the fresh fish, the rock salt and the popping tobiko.

We finished with the Yuzu citrus dessert which was yuzu curds, merengue, and strawberry gelato. It was a nice tart finish to the meal.

Overall the meal was about $155 including tax and tip. It was a great experience but not the most bang for your buck since it left us still wanting more to fill our bellies."}
{"text":"The decor is very dark and decadent; you feel surrounded by glossy black, marble, and gold. Service was quite good, as was the food overall. The reason why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because it is unfortunately just way too expensive for the amount of food you get.  The wine list has some reasonable bottles ($60 ish), but one of the cocktails was $30!! 

While I won't go back, I think it's a restaurant worth trying if you want to celebrate a special occasion, and if you're not particularly hungry.  Here is my summary of various menu items:
- Wagyu short rib - REALLY delicious flavour, tender and juicy. But it only comes with 3 tiny morsels of meat
- Tacos - delicious, but so small 
- Truffle bomb - so good. Recommend these for sure!
- Wagyu fried rice was far superior to kimchi fried rice
- Chocolate in a cup was by far the best dessert. Get one all for yourself and do not share. Matcha cake was forgettable. The black sesame cheesecake literally comes as 4 tiny cubes meant for a microscopic human to eat. The yuzu dessert is tasty but too small.  I AM A GROWING BOY. 

I do not recommend the following items:
- Filet mignon - one of the servings was nicely medium rare but the other one was overcooked
- Tuna tataki, salmon tataki, and hirame carpaccio - meh
- Tuna pizza - this was supposed to be a standout dish but I thought it was meh; the crust is very thin and lacks flavour
- Brother/Mother roll - this sushi roll has fois gras and it seems totally unnecessary. Overly saucy."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I dined here for a date night as we love trying new spots downtown! Our reservation was for 930 we were seated at 945 pm the host with super curly hair was extra nice she deserves employee of the month! she noticed our candle was out as we were seated & went above and beyond to have it lit and make our night special. She really cares about her job and clients! She let us have drink at the bar downstairs as we arrived early we were shocked at how friendly and accommodating the staff was it was our first time but we felt like regulars! Shoutout to LIEF our waiter quick and every time he passed by he made sure to check in and ensure us we were noticed and being taken care of. We ordered plenty of apps but when we finished I became aware I wouldn't be able to finish my entree he had no problem stopping the kitchen with no hesitation! I always over order haha...We both have history in customer service and really appreciated him engaging with us through out the evening and at the end to ask our favourite meal and even offer us to book specifically with him next time we visit! How nice! Amazing service see you soon! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the more upscale restaurants catering to the more modern/trendy Japanese food lovers out there.  The environment is set to be a very unique experience where it has a bit of the Western environment with music and dim lights, however on the opposite side it has a brighter area where the chefs go to work almost and like a sushi bar (You really have to go there to understand what I mean by this as the dining area is kind of separated from the sushi bar area).  

The location is easy enough to find as it is right beside the famous Bisha Hotel/Condos right in the heart of downtown.  Food was a great experience here as my friend and I tried a lot of hot and cold shares including Crispy Fried Squid, Tuna Pizza, Salmon Tataki as well as many other dishes that would just make one salivate.

Prices are relatively high and my friend and I thought it was quite cheap at first as each dish ranged from only 20-40 dollars until we realize that the serving sizes and share dishes are really meant to get your taste buds going.  In order to be fully satisfied when you come here, I think for two people, you will at least need 5-7 dishes.  As you see, if you multiply 5-7 dishes with an average cost of 20-40 bucks, you will hit close to the 300 dollars mark which I like to coin the official broke part of the evening on your wallet.  Food wise, definitely worth the price, even though I was really surprised at the portions of the dish and each dish was crafted exquisitely and carefully to the point of perfection that I would definitely come out and eat here again :)"}
{"text":"I am not sure if I ate at the same restaurant that have posted reviews here. This is is how I would describe this place: 1-overlybooshie 2-overpriced 3-portions are TINY. They capitalize on the background of the famous starred chef, but fail to deliver a consistent high quality dining experience. Things I have experience in a 4 people, 700 dollar, I am still hungry, dinner: 1-waitress was a sales person. Pushed us to order the crab dish as a car salesman wants to get rid of his worst chevy. 2- same waitress, with very average mannerism and lack of training, disappeared from the restaurant and was nowhere to be found and forgot our drinks (bartender came to the table to help us) 3- food portions of \"mains\" are just silly. We ordered with the idea of \"let's share\" but sharing consisted really of a mini taste per person in most dishes and was disappointing. The toro tartare dish, in itself was the size of a toe nail. These guys should try a toro tartare at Japango. The miso black cod was poorly executed. The miso sauce was incredibly thick and the sweetness made the 30 something dollar dish unedible. A couple of speciality rolls were incredibly creative and good (the one with foie gras). But, for me the juice is not worth the squeeze in this establishment. It will have a market because Toronto people love over the top fancy place like this, though with the current competition in the market, this place does not have a 1 year life in it unless the service, price to quality, portions, and overall quality of the service changes drastically. 

Best luck Akira and starred chef. Up your game."}
{"text":"Great ambience; fancy and casual at the same time. We ordered the \"brother from another\"roll and \"show me the roll\". Both were pretty good but preferred the latter as it had a bit more flavor. The taste was proportionate to the price-- neither cheap nor pricey. We also had the matcha mousse cake which was average but the salted ice cream on the side was good. However, our server, who was at first eager and professional in explaining the menu, seemed upset after we ordered only two dishes. He was also visibly impatient when we asked to split the bills. For this reason, I doubt I will be returning."}
{"text":"Came on a Wednesday night, we had reservations but there seemed to be enough tables to accommodate a few more walk-ins.

The ambience of this place is quite nice, it fits in quite well with the dark, luxurious feel that the Bisha Hotel exudes. The service was top notch, my water glass was always full and all the staff were very attentive and friendly.

To share we ordered four small dishes: Tuna Pizza, Ab Wagyu Tacos, Rock Shrimp, Wagyu Fried Rice and then four rolls: the Pop Rockin, Hot Mess, Protein and Brother From Another Mother.

The Tuna pizza is very thin, different than your typical fish-on-fried-rice-patty type of \"sushi pizza\" and had a very light yet intense flavour. The Wagyu tacos were also delicious, but very small, only one bite each.

The fried rice and shrimp were both good, but nothing special. I reckon they might have been better as an accompaniment for a main such as the Toban Filet Mignon (which a table near us got and it smelled delicious).

As for the rolls, my personal favourite and recommendation would be for the Brother From Another Mother. The flavours were very strong and the rolls rests on a giant pool of sesame sauce. Each piece is finished off with a small dollop of fois gras which just makes each bite incredibly rich and flavourful.

The Hot Mess was also quite tasty, it was just a bunch of flavours all coming together to a delicious bite. The Protein was much more low-key with the main attraction being different types of fish on each piece, but it was a much more light flavour and relied more on the fish than sauces.

The Pop Rockin roll was interesting, because they actually had pop rocks inside the roll which make the experience very unique. However I was not a huge fan of the taste of candy in a sushi roll.

For dessert we shared a Matcha Mousse Cake and the Black Sesame Cheesecake. The Matcha one was delicious and actually tasted a bit more like cheesecake to me than the sesame one. To our surprise, the sesame one has more of a \"deconstructed\" vibe, so the cheesecake parts were actually small perfect cubes. So the portion size was tiny, but it did taste wonderful, very strong with only a subtle tinge of sweetness.

The portion sizes here are very small, and most items comes with between 4-8 pieces, so you probably need at least 2-3 items a person if you are sharing. Overall experience was very great, would come again."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant as of 2018!!! SO worth the cost. Just want to start off by saying our server (I think his name is Josh) was very helpful and accommodating. He went through the menu and recommended the best dishes. 

Once you try the sushi here I can guarantee all the other sushi you have afterwards won't compare. Each sushi roll didnt need soy sauce because all of the ingredients and flavours -- each piece melts in your mouth. 

Would recommend the roll brother from another mother, and the roll with the white wrapping -- called Hot mess

Definitely coming back and would highly recommend for special occasions!"}
{"text":"Yum!! Akira Back has delicious, modern Japanese food that is so unique! My boyfriend and I had an awesome waiter who gave us suggestions throughout the menu. It's a fun concept because you're able to try a bunch of menu offerings and not be super full at the end of your meal. I haven't added pictures of all of the dishes we ate, but the tuna pizza pictured first was definitely our favourite. Aside from the great food and service, the atmosphere is really nice. The only downside was the $30 dollar cocktail that tasted like any old fashioned you could get anywhere for half the price. Other than that, we were really happy with this new spot!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for anniversary dinner and loved the whole experience. All the staff were friendly and constantly making sure we were okay. The ambiance here is amazing and honestly one of the most beautiful interior designed restaurants for me in Toronto. We had the following dishes:
Wagyu tacos- our favourite !! Wagyu melts in your mouth and the crispy shell was so good
Brother from Another mother roll- presentation of the roll was so nice and mix of flavours was good
Unagi roll and toro tuna roll were okay
Wagyu fried rice- so good as well, rice is a bit like sticky rice coupled with green onions, garlic and beef goodness
Matcha cake- light, sweet ending to our meal and the vanilla cream was unique tasting

Overall, loved my time at Akira back and look forward to revisiting another time!"}
{"text":"Had my first experience at Akira Back last night. It was a ray of sunshine in a otherwise extremely rainy day. 

I went with a foodie friend of mine who heard rave reviews and I was hesitant at first due to the price and portion sizes of the food. However I was pleasantly surprised. 

Atmosphere - the restaurant is one door south of the Bisha Hotel on Blue Jays Way (how fitting as yesterday was the Blue Jays Home opener) on the second floor. There is an elevator for those with accessibility needs and a GORGEOUS golden staircase that is Instagram worthy. Inside the restaurant the decor is modern with hints of tradition. A theme that continues into the food. It was quiet when we arrived at 6:45pm but definitely got packed and louder around 8pm as lager groups arrived. 

Service - the hostess is lovely and made genuine effort to converse with us and even remembered us at the end of the night when we picked up our coats. Our server was phenomenal; made excellent suggestions. Did not rush us and was always attentive. He even walked me to the restroom as it was my first time there. 

Food - what can I say? It definitely lived up to its hype. We sampled through 4 signature cocktails and all were delicious. The Sakitini was hands down my favourite: tart, lightly sweetened and very refreshing. 

We ordered the famous tuna pizza. It came on a crumbly base drizzled in truffle oil and salt and pepper. It was divine. 


Next we had the fried octopus with two kinds of poached Asian pear. Great flavours and textures but very small portions as it was the equivalent of 1 tentacle. 

I had the waygu fried rice and it was a decent portion and well made. A must try side dish if you have a hearty appetite. 

For rolls we had the hot mess roll. Tasty but nothing that blew me away. 

The desserts however were fantastic. Do order the matcha cheesecake and I really could have had 2 portions to myself. 

Will it be a regular spot that I come to? Probably not as the prices are a but high. But Would I come back for special occasions and the infrequent girls night outs? Absolutely! 

Overall Akira Back lived up to its name and in all areas exceeded my expectations and I left full and satisfied."}
{"text":"The food is Really good, but at the same time the service isn't great. Our server was really distracted and not really nice, but the main problem was that I called the restaurant twice and told them that we celebrate our anniversary, but they totally forgot it, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Very funky restaurant with cool decor. Drinks pricey but fast. I had the Akira Back sakatini and Yasuke sour. The menu is actually quite extensive and hard to pick and choose. The Tuna pizza with truffle oil was AWESOME! I also really like the kimchi and bacon fried rice. The wagyu short ribs were very moist but a bit cool when served. I think if it was hotter the beef would be even more melt in your mouth. 

The spicy tuna roll was really good and the miso cod was nice. I would consider going back but probably would have preferred more of a tasting menu or chef selection. The waiter was not super helpful with the food selection and I felt a bit rushed through the meal at times."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Every course was great. Service was top notch. Nobu is going to be in trouble when they open up because this blew it away on all accounts."}
{"text":"luxurious ambiance and service but to me it was merely an overpriced high end izakaya. we ordered the :

wagyu tacos - people rave about this but it just tasted like regular teriyaki beef in hard taco shells to me. i'm no meat connoisseur and maybe it takes one to identify wagyu but when beef is minced so finely like this, who can tell if its wagyu or any ol' minced beef?
alaskin king crab - i love seafood but smothering the crab leg meat in mayonnaise did not work for me
black cod- a bit too sweet 
ribeye - i like my steak a slightly charred on the outside and medium on the inside but this steak came very pale on the exterior as if it was boiled/steamed then plated with wasabi sauce on top
wagyu fried rice - basic teriyaki beef fried rice
kimchi & bacon fried rice - basic kimchi fried rice
tuna pizza - great thin crust pizza 
yellowtail serrano - i enjoyed this sashimi appetizer as it wasn't oily and had a hint of yuzu to it. im a sucker for anything yuzu!
brother from another mother roll - honestly don't remember what it tasted like

the food overall was not bad but it wasn't memorable. the decor was definitely chic and deluxe with literally black coloured toilets (i don't think i've seen that anywhere and find it extraordinarily cool lol) and a gold ascending stairway leading to the restaurant BUT i still don't think i would pay the price tag for pretentious japanese tapas again.."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a recently opened upscale Asian place. Decor is very modern and it's easy to reach by TTC. Menu is Japanese style with lots of choices of sushi, sashimi and rolls. I enjoyed the hot mess roll and the crispy octopus. There is a good wine list as well as sake choices. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable although service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The pop rocks roll was a really fun experience! Black cod was amazing and the brother from another mother roll (we got it without the fois gras). The sushi pizza was good, but wasn't as amazing as they hyped it up to be."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I would say this is probably one of my top 10 favorite restaurants in Toronto. The menu is inspired from the chef's childhood. For example, the chef loved to eat candy as a child, so he created a sushi roll that included pop rocks! The plates are also beautifully designed and hand painted by his mother. This is not only an amazing culinary experience, but an artistic experience too!

Memorable dishes that you must try:

1) Truffle Bomb Croquette (5/5) - if you enjoy the taste of truffle, this will be a dream come true! 
2) Tuna Pizza (5/5) - the flavors are so complex and work so well together. Absolutely amazing.
3) Uni sushi (5/5) - the gold of the sea... the best uni I have had in Toronto (been to Yasu, Skippa, Jabistro and Miku to name a few restaurants) and very VERY generous in size!

Good but not memorable:

1) Wagyu Tacos (3.5/5) - they were good, but nothing amazing. Would pass on this next time we come back. 
2) Brother from Another Mother (3/5) - let's just say sushi rolls are not their forte. I would pass on the rolls and try the 'hot share' or 'main dishes'

Overall, this was an amazing experience. Whenever I get asked... \"where should I take my friend who is visiting Toronto to eat\"... Akira Back will come to mind!"}
{"text":"My girls took me there for my pre-Bday dinner, the place is stunning. From the gold walls walking up the stairs to the stunning table set up. It is definitely a place you should try if you are a sushi lover they have a great selection. However I wasn't in love with the mains, from their steak to the rib it wasn't the best I have had. I did love their salmon, and their fried octopus it was delicious. I loved the enomoto margarita it was different and I loved the taste. Their service is amazing,  our server was super attentive. I would go back to try out the rest of their menu, and maybe  my perspective will change."}
{"text":"The first time blew me away, every bite was a treasure that I decided to come back again for a special occasion. The second time was still pleasant but had some misses. Stick to their seafood share-ables and you should be good for the most part! 

Highlights (In order)
1) Tuna Pizza - Usually not a fan of sushi pizza but this is just so amazing. Delicate and unique flavours - A must try!
2) Truffle 'Bomb' Croquette - This is really THE BOMB. That potato sauce makes you tempted to lick off the plate. It comes in three's, the awkward moment when you decide who gets the last one. 
3) Hot Mess - Sashimi Poke in a Sushi - If you're feeling like a roll this is it!
4) AB Tuna Tacos - It's just so good. Enough said. 
5) Salmon Tataki - Sliced seared salmon, it's simple but perfectly flavoured
6) Kimchi & Bacon Fried Rice - Another simple dish but executed perfectly and just delicious

Do not recommend (Ordered from the worse) 
1) Toban Filet Mignon - Big miss! It's served on a sizzling skillet with a lid on top and they will open it in front of you for a smoky show. The meat was missing the grilled charred element and tasted like it was steamed from being under the lid. The worst and really nothing special. I've had better for way less than $39. [waiter recommended it over the lamb we were thinking of ordering]
2) Brother from another Mother - The sushi is too rich from the combination of foie gras and having the sushi sit on a puddle of creamy sauce. It makes it too heavy...  
3) Dessert, in general, is not their forte - I didn't like their Black Sesame Cheese Cake - Lack sesame flavour but looks like a work of art! Matcha-mousse cake and the apple dessert was probably better of the ones I've tried but not worth $12.

A place like this you can expect consistent top-notch service, they will take your coats as you walk in. Our waitress was stylish with nice nails - matte grey with gold accents (love that combo, couldn't help but notice) and the waiter we had the second time was very friendly/personable. We reserved for a birthday, and our server even provided a pick from the dessert menu on the house. 

The first time experience was 5, second time was 3, so averages out to 4 star. It wasn't hard to get a table on a prime time and on weekends so that's a major plus. Also be aware they may have set menus on some holidays aka. Valentine's Day -my friends came on that day and weren't pleased that they had to order the set menu. The chef is Michelin-starred, but I say stick to the highlighted dishes and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went to Akira Back for a little celebratory dinner. We ordered the tuna pizza and t
Truffle bomb croquettes for starters. The pizza is amazing! Perfect for sharing and definitely worth the price! It looked so plain and simple but theres so much flavour. The truffle bomb croquettes were pretty amazig as well. Very complex flavours that work really well together. You get 3 small bites for $25 so its a bit pricey. We ordered unagi roll and uni sushi, both tasted really fresh. The unagi roll waa good but nothing special. The uni sushi had a very generous serving of uni on top. It was good but not as good as the uni from Yasu's premium sashimi add on. We were still a bit hungry so i ordered the grilled alaskan king crab legs which were SO good. I'vr never had anything like it before. The crab tasted sweet and fresh and the flavour had a bit of a kick to it. My boyfriend had the ab wagyu tacos. The beef was cooked bulgogi style, which was a little too sweet according to my boyfriend but still good. Our faves from this meal: Tuna Pizza, Truffle Bomb Croquette, Grilled Alaskan King Crab legs"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my birthday. Wanted something new and something good. The overall experience is as good as expected. 

Food was delicious, ambience was romantic, upbeat and fun, decoration was beautiful, felt like in a cave of goodness and the service was awesome! 

Sometimes upscale restaurant may accidentally hire snobbish overrated staff, but at here the service was professional, friendly, and diligent! 

Food, the tuna pizza is a must order, it's not \" Japanese sushi pizza\" you ordered from Ubereat or the corner Japanese restaurant near your house. It was Wow. Wagyu taco was great, wish it wasn't minced wagyu because it lost the taste and texture of wagyu. The uni croquette was flavour explosion! So good but so small! \" brother from another mother \" sushi was hilarious and delicious, love the sauce. Cocktails are all on point !

Will I come back again? Yes, love to try more different dish."}
