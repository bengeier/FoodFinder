{"text":"On a recent visit home, my family and I decided to have Sunday brunch here. There wasn't any snow when I was out the view of the city was still quite nice.

The food is prepared fresh and in house. I was quite pleased to see such a large assortment of items in such a small place. The restaurant itself is on the small side and is not that fancy but what it lacks in decor it made for it in flavor. 

I thought the Naturbahn Teahouse was also reasonably priced at $20 per adult. I didn't feel like we herded out like cattle as there were a lot of open tables but if the restaurant was busy I could see the hourly slots being a problem."}
{"text":"$25 for a non descript brunch on fathers day. 

Shrimp that smelled off, the usual suspects of premade French toast and pancakes, sausage, bacon, eggs et al. 

Nothing spectacular about this at all - even the view that many others rave about is a disappointment since the building is set so far back from the edge of the slope.  

Like of much of Calgary's Olympic infrastructure, this building was built in the mid-80s and doesnt match fit the mold of something suitable for 2010.

At $15 for brunch it would be passable, for the $25  we were charged, it's a laughable insult."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something different for Mother's Day brunch, this place might fit the bill. On a clear day, the restaurant offers a breathtaking view of the city, so ask for a window seat.

Each Sunday offers about 5-6 seatings and you pretty much have a set time to eat because there are people waiting for the next sitting. (Sort of had the feeling that I was being herded out of there like cattle when we were leaving.) 

The food items are served buffet-style, and the offerings are quite nice, including eggs benedict and fancy breakfast pastries.

For an extra cost you can start your morning right with orange juice and champagne. 

Book way in advance for an Easter or Mother's Day Brunch, otherwise you'll likely be out of luck."}
