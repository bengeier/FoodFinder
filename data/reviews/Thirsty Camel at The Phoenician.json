{"text":"Tea time? Ice Cream & Sorbet time? Creme Brulee time? Relaxing-the night time? It's all here!  This has a been one of the fav spots lately for our group's tea time after dinner, or ice cream, or dessert, or just to enjoy the nice night view with some great live music! The house-made vanilla and chocolate ice cream is amazing! And the selection of different sorbets are so delicious (have been offered a few different flavors on multiple  trips). As the weather is starting cooling down, I can see an increasing number of trips!!  The only drawback is that service seems always to be slow. There were a couple of times there was only one waitress for the entire patio and it took 30 mins just to pay, so have a little patience if that is your case."}
{"text":"I just love coming here when I am in Scottsdale!  Prefer to sit outside on their terrace that overlooks the city in the evening when they have their fire pits going.  Just a few cocktails and an appetizer or two can set you back some bucks but hey, every once in a while you got to treat yourself!"}
{"text":"Fantastic scenery, phenomenal service no matter when you go, a very pleasant decor/smell/ambience, and decent drink and food specials. Some of the food there is the best I've ever had from that category.  I don't drink much outside of wine, but the wine list isn't half bad.  No matter how I feel, I can't not be in a great mood sitting at the Thirsty Camel.  It's the best of the best in the city as far as I'm concerned, and I have recommended in multiple times for numerous situations."}
{"text":"Let's be honest: the number one reason to come here is the view on the patio. Kicking back on a loveseat around the firepits with a cocktail and some snacks... It doesn't get much better.   All of the drinks we tried were solid. No one standout, but just well-mixed drinks. Extensive tequila and liquor selection in general. Didn't get to try much food, but the crab dip appetizer one night really hit the spot.   Being able to light up a cigar outside just completes the experience."}
{"text":"Come here for great view and ambiance, but expect overpriced food and drinks.   Ordered: 1. DUCK CONFIT TACOS: 2/5 ehhh...not memorable at all 2. TIRAMISU: 3/5 better than my entree  Won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"Perfect view, yummy drinks, great musician, and a book is a lil attainable slice of heaven! No much needed to be written..."}
{"text":"Only had drinks at the lounge and sat out on the patio. Beautiful views and just a wonderful ambiance."}
{"text":"My husband and I spent a weekend at The Canyon Suites last month, and came by the Thirsty Camel for drinks on both the Friday and Saturday nights. It was a nice hotel bar, with indoor lounge and bar seating, a big outdoor patio, and a lovely view. A great spot for a nightcap if you're staying at The Phoenician.  The vibe was upscale but relaxing--you would never confuse the Thirsty Camel for anything other than a hotel bar. We spent one night next to a large group of loud middle-aged white people on some kind of company retreat. I overheard one of the women proclaim proudly, \"Anyone who offends me who's a woman is a whore.\" Her male friends were super amused by that. Service was good. I appreciated that there was table service all night. The staff was attentive, even when we were sitting outside. They set us up with tasty bar nuts and brought our cocktails in good time.  The drinks were decent, nothing thrilling, but definitely solid. I enjoyed the Triple S, a spicy tequila cocktail made with El Tesoro Blanco, agave nectar, jalape√±o, watermelon, and lime, with a hickory smoked-salt rim. The Phoenix Rising was apparently the signature cocktail, and this was good, made with Woodford Reserve bourbon, cointreau, orange juice, Angostura and Fee's orange bitters, grenadine, and orange peel. The Thirsty Sazerac was a serviceable sazerac, mixing Bulleit rye with green chartreuse, brown sugar, Angostura and Fee's lemon bitters, and lemon peel. If you're feeling spendy, the Five Diamond Manhattan is a well-made $20 Manhattan with Woodford Reserve, Carpano Antica, and Fee's barrel-aged bitters.  I doubt I'd drink here if I weren't staying at this hotel, but that's kind of the great thing about hotel bars. They're luxurious but unfussy, easy to visit before slipping off to bed. I really like The Phoenician and The Canyon Suites, and if I have occasion to visit again, I'm sure I'll be back for another round at the Thirsty Camel."}
{"text":"Overpriced wine, only a view for atmosphere.Why do they think their $10 bottle wine is worth $18.00 glass....?....greed greed greed"}
{"text":"This place was great!  The view was gorgeous and the food was just as good, corn dogs with truffle ketchup, Yum!   There was any sort of alcohol, wine, and beer you could ever want which is always a good thing to me!   The only problem was the service.  It was really slow...  Our waitress made up for it though!  She bought us two amazing deserts paired with a delicious desert wine.   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great live music. Beautiful scenic views. The best service in town.  Sounds great--right?  My husband and I recently stayed at the Phoenician and made visiting the Thirsty Camel a nightly ritual.  The beer and liquor selection is excellent and the apps are great (try the dip trio!).  The prices are a little high (I recommend having a happy hour!) but the experience is worth it.  Bottom line:  Will we be back?  Gosh! I sure hope so:)"}
{"text":"Amazing views of the Valley and well mixed drinks, but the service is always a little slow."}
{"text":"The food is really good. Nice wine and alcohol selection. To top it all of, the wait staff is super super nice.  The ambience is just like any other run of the mill hotel bars. The outside sitting does compensate a lot for the generic ambience."}
{"text":"Since this bar was right outside the door of my room, I happen to make several visits.  Most of them were very positive.  Most of the bars at the Phoenician will make a good mojito.  This place makes the best.  It is one of the best mojitos I had in a long time.  The bar is very nice.  Looks like something you would find in San Francisco.  Very large marble bar with high bar stools and very nice furnishings and a large out-door area for sitting and relaxing, especially toward dusk.  The bar also has a fine selection of cigars.  I don't think you can smoke there.  I did not eat at the bar.  They did serve a selection of tasty nuts though.  The staff was pretty friendly, except for one young guy.  I guess he just got hired or something.  That guy made a big deal about two of my guest not wearing sleeves?  Not like we are in the UAE or Saudi Arabia!  Any way, did not make a big deal since my room was next door, but still kind of weird.  I know it is a 5-star hotel, but it is summer, the pool is right out the door and they were wearing nice tank-tops.  What ever.  I still liked the bar.  If you need to make a choice in hotels, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I came to the Phoenician for a conference.  I stopped by the Thirsy Camel one evening for a quick dinner.  John, the bartender is great!  He knows what he is doing and is always ready to serve you!  His sidekick Robert is always ready to assist him when things get busy.  They're like the Ying and Yang of the Thirst Camel.  Look for them and you won't go wrong!  The avocado sushi was excellent.  Everything is fresh as expected from the Phoenician. If I'm not mistaken, they only have sushi available around the weekends.  They have a nice stock of beer, wine and spirits so feel free to have them mix you up something or create something of your own!  Excellent service and relaxing atmosphere, doesn't get any better.    They only have one TV in the area for watching sports/news/etc that I can see.  So if the bar is crowded and have the TV behind you, watching can be difficult!"}
{"text":"As you would expect this is a fantastic venue to eat a drink, grab an appetizer or, just sit and gaze at the scenery. They are currently renovating parts of the facility, but the Thirsty camel is not effected.   I'm a lover of old fashioned bourbon cocktails and their proprietary version is quite the treat. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. One of the best. Really liked our stay and my stop into the Thirsty Camel. We had the place rented out for a party. Nice band and good drinks. All the food was good. For sure would come back."}
{"text":"Went there the other evening to listen to my drummer pal, Joe Costello and his group.   Sat out on the balcony because the weather was perfect.   And check out the views of the pools.   Wow!!  Spectacular from above.   The coloring is what makes them pop.    At first it was hard to get service.   My companion went to the bar twice to see if servers were even working the patio.   Yes, we were told.  An assistant brought us water as we waited and waited.   Maybe too much real estate to cover for two or three servers??  Hillary was our server.   She is very professional, personable, and knowledgable.  She showed up a little trick to \"chill\" the red wine.   Quite interesting and informative.  There are firepits -- which I didn't feel the need to use -- and comfy chairs as well as tables with chairs.   We chose a comfy couch.  Just peaceful up there.   So peaceful, in fact, that I was sorry we had to leave.  Either valet park or self park i the garage.   If self park, get a ticket from the server in order to get out of the garage.  I would definitely want to return.  And I'm looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Great service and love the Pheonician. I had the Manhattan and wife had spicy margarita. Both drink put together really well. Again the staff is top notch."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  For a fantastic view and a great glass of wine, it can't be beat.  The atmosphere is excellent.  I put this place on the same level as the lounge at Pelican Hill in Newport Beach.    The bartender we had was Shawn and he actually remembered us from the previous year we were there which was impressive.  I give 5-stars to Shawn as well.  We tried a couple of different wines and also a specialty drink that he recommended which we found to be terrific.  We also ordered a plate of hummus which was done well although it could have used more flatbread to accompany it.  Shawn did however quickly retrieve more of that for us.    For anyone looking to start out a weekend evening in Scottsdale, I highly recommend this lounge because it satisfies several elements that people who are used to a nice, sophisticated environment that also has energy tend to seek out."}
{"text":"Whatever thirsty camel shows up here for a drink or some better have some serious moolah.  As a NYer, I am used to $15-16 per drink, but that doesn't mean I'm too crazy about it. You are essentially paying for the view and the honor of sitting your rear end at a bar in a resort that runs upward of $700 per night."}
{"text":"Came to meet a friend for happy hour on a Friday.  It was around 6ish and had to wait about 10 minutes to get into the resort.  The Phoenician had a information stand as you drive into the resort and the greeter stopped every car to ask where they were going.  It backed up everything which made me late meeting my friend.  It was so ridiculous.  Anyhow, once the greeter gave me my valet pass I could finally make it up to the resort.  We sat outside and the view was beautiful.  They had a live band playing at the pool which we could hear BUT they also had a guitar player in the lounge inside the Thirsty Camel.  So, when the door was open you had two different style of music playing.    Anyhow, our waitress was awesome, great wine selection, we ordered a veggie appetizer which was good.  After two glasses of wine and my friend and I split the  veggie appetizer, I was in for 50 bucks.    I won't do this every Friday, but it was nice because in those few hours I felt I was on vacation.....once I got pass the information stand/greeter."}
{"text":"What a relaxing way to end the evening...a cocktail in hand alongside Camelback Mountain with breathtaking views.  I was here on a Sunday evening with three other people.  We came here after dinner for a cocktail.  I have been here many times, but this was the first time in about 2 years.  Our waitress was professional and friendly, but did not write down our drink orders.  This was fine until she forgot what I had ordered.  She also said she would bring out waters on three separate trips to the table which never occurred.  I had a Mai Tai and it was excellent and worth the wait.  The service is usually much better.  Bring a jacket or sweatshirt as it can cool down at night and you are exposed to the wind.  There is nothing for enjoyable than having a beverage or two with soft music in the background.  We sat around a stone fire place in comfortable outdoor couches...perfect!  The lighting is dimmed and views are spectacular.  They do have a menu for appetizers and small plates as well.  Spoil yourself with a beverage here...it is worth it!  You can go here if you are not staying at the resort, but you do need to pay for parking.  Check out the walking paths behind the resort too...great for pictures!!!"}
{"text":"Went into the Thirsty Camel on Wednesday and was greeted instantly with warm smiles and welcomes. Went to the bar and was helped out by Robert and Ashley B. Both were very knowledgable and extremely friendly! The resort was busy for midweek, seemed like there was a few corporate groups. Highly recommend going in!"}
{"text":"What a great Bar at the Phoeniciean! The bartender Chris is awesome!! Very personal, makes great drinks, very professional, takes his job seriously and a great personality! Will be going back! Had a great time!"}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance, extremely friendly and courteous staff. Outstanding drink menu. The views of the mountains were amazing. Very relaxing atmosphere. Tried the guacamole and ceviche appetizers, which were delicious! Will come back again."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars (and not 5) simply because the drinks are  f-ing expensive.  The seafood risotto just may be the best meal south of Camelback Mountain.  Believe it or not, for $32, it's a bargain - it comes with lobster tail, scallops, shrimp, and of course risotto.  Unlike many other high end eateries, you will not walk away feeling hungry.  The bartenders at Thirsty Camel are all top notch and friendly.  Jeff, Scott, and Kyle are sure to take care of your every need.  The people come from all over the country, conversation is never dull, and the views certainly don't suck.  You can't go wrong at the Camel - if you're looking for a piece of ass, there are sure to be many a cougar on the prowl at this joint.  On the other hand, if you're looking to wine and dine your date, this is a great hotel bar to check out.  Who knows, if you get lucky, some of the nicest rooms in town are a few steps away."}
{"text":"How do I love thee Thirsty Camel? Let me count thy ways...  1) The scenery rocks! 2) Love going to a resort for a nightcap, makes me feel like I'm on vacation 3) The service is typically top-notch (ask for Kaylyn) 4) Great little snackies - cashews, wasabi peas, etc 5) Ambiance of a luxury resort 6) Getting discounts on Restaurant.com 7) Getting SPG points for my purchases here... 8) Close to home 9) The food is pretty good - - kobe burger is great! 10) The bellinis..... ohhh, the bellinis!"}
{"text":"You have to get a drink with Chris. He makes the best cocktails. My boyfriend and I searched near and far for a certain drink with no luck. Chris was able to create and perfect it!! He'll make you a great drink and he will remember your name."}
