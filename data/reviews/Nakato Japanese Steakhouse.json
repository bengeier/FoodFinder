{"text":"This place is really nice and the staff were all very friendly.  We stuck to the sushi bar side and everything looked and tasted very fresh.  While I stuck to my regular standards, they had a very good selection.  I really liked this place and expect to return whenever I am in town for business."}
{"text":"The place looks nice and the waitresses/chef are very nice. However, the salmon was not good. It fell apart and had bones in it. I first ordered salmon sashimi and then got salmon nigiri instead. I also got the Crunchy roll and it was soft...not crunchy. Overall, I was not impressed with the food but liked the people."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I had dinner with my parents and decided to try the sushi instead of the hibachi grill, and I am, glad I did.  This is some of the best sushi I have had in Charlotte.  The overall restaurant is very nice and relaxing, service is great and like I said before, the food is spot on.  The only negative I can say is it is a little pricey, but you do get quite a bit of food.  We will continue to come here, and if I have a first date with a lady, this will be my choice."}
{"text":"Very pretty restaurant.  By far the nicest ambiance Japanese steak house in the clt area.  Food was quite good also.  Service was excellent.  Sushi menu was quite varied for a steak house.  Overall and excellent experience."}
{"text":"This place is marginal. It has an oder when you walk in that doesn't go away. It could be the carpet, maybe not the best flooring choice. I had the sashimi combo which was average at best fish. The edamame was sub par which I figured was hard to do. The did hold the shrimp as I had asked."}
{"text":"We stopped here last week to try the sushi. Nice atmosphere and the staff was friendly. We ordered a special of the day roll that we cant remember the name of and also a rock-n-roll. The rolls were fresh and good. An average place for sushi. We rate it A-Ok..."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about the service here. We had an issue the manager came right out apologized and gave us a free meal.. I will be back.."}
{"text":"Slow service and mediocre food, I have had way better. I would recommend this place if you like basic food and service."}
{"text":"I have to say overall I am not very exited about this place. The ambient is not so bad,  a lot of tables and the waitress was cute. ... About the Shusi... ;) Got Vulcano, Tuna and Superman roll. The Miso Soup was hot but the taste only average. You could get the Kirin beer only as draft when you don't want to drink the 12 oz bottle. I am not why draft beer has a frozen foam...
The rolls were as well nothing exiting average again someone said something about pricing and it is right 38$ is not ever age... Would I go again!? I might but will look for different places as well..."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is always delicious. And you won't be leaving hungry. 

With entrees you get onion soup, ginger salad, white or fried rice, mixed veggies, and noodles. 

I always substitute the salad for an extra soup which they have no issue with. I love that. 

We always end up here on someone's birthday, and when you tell them they song in English and Japanese and you get a cake and a photo! 

Anyway...go here if you're looking for a good hibachi place!"}
{"text":"It was an amazing experience. The chef was wonderful very friendly and fun. The food was awesome and it was a great amount for the price. They sung happy birthday in Japanese. It was a really cool experience."}
{"text":"I questioned this place since Google used yelps 3 month old negative reviews as the top ones. After digging deeper into the reviews, I found some good remarks and decided to go. IT WAS GREAT. Server and cook were nice. Service was prompt. Food tasted so good. I am so glad we went."}
{"text":"The food is terrific and the table chefs are fun. 
The experience of watching food made in food in front of you is always fun, but to have a show and interaction to go along with it, makes up the game. I've been to this restaurant so many times and have never been disappointed.

Have fun, take a group and enjoy the show, its well worth it."}
{"text":"We come mainly for the sushi when we don't want to drive too far. One of the better places to get sushi in the University area.

Our must haves: baked mussels, scallop mix (which most other places call spicy scallop), sweet shrimp, and if they have it, uni. 

The baked mussels are delish!! They cut each mussel which makes it easier to eat and allows you to savor the spicy mayo-ie goodness. I like that the scallop mix doesn't have tempura crunches and actually has a little bit of a kick from they spicy mayo. When there is a new shipment of uni, score!! Creamy, oceanie goodness in your mouth... As for the sweet shrimp, the best part is the head. They fry it up nicely where you can eat the entire thing. Who doesn't love good head?!!

I don't care for their sushi rolls as I'm not a big roll eater, but they have a few that are really good, like the Panther roll and negi toro.

The sushi chefs are really nice. Don't be fooled by the one that looks like a grumpy old man, he is cool and might secretly be a ninja.

Their hibachi is good. Their salad dressing is kind of weird though. Service is great most of the time."}
{"text":"Very Good food, but... Maybe making it for so many people at the same time doesn't let the food cook throughly, still very delicious and fun place."}
{"text":"I'd give this a 3.5 only due to lack of rolls. Sushi (nigiri) was great,but I like some crazy rolls on the menu.  Had one that was good but not a huge selection.  I'll be back.. It's close to the hotels so easy walk."}
{"text":"The food here was very good and fresh! I got the Teriyaki chicken with fried rice and it was amazing! The cooks that  cook in front of you are very entertaining as well! We will defiantly  be returning."}
{"text":"Great place for you sushi fix! The food was great service was good and the atmosphere was Kool with the hibachi Chefs cooking and having a great time showing off.

Great for Families."}
{"text":"We sort of liked parts of Nakato, but thought the overall picture didn't really add up.

The sushi was good, but was served very late in the meal, despite being ordered first thing. One of the pieces I received was totally different from what I ordered. When the waiter fessed up, I was still charged for it. That is the type of restaurant this is.

The show was not among the best I have seen, and the chef looked like he was not really interested in the performance. The food was VERY salty, with everything getting a healthy dose of soy sauce. The portions are quite large.  

The soup was watery, and did not have the obligatory fried onions, the salad was typical ginger dressing, but not sweet at all. 

Our meal was quite expensive, well over $100 for the 3 of us, not including tip.  

Ultimately, we feel this restaurant is yet another lame ripoff of Benihana, which is better, but no longer among the best of these restaurants either in my opinion.

We would not go again, having experienced far better. However in the current climate in Charlotte, this restaurant will probably be around forever."}
{"text":"I love Nakatos! Their food is always consistently good no matter who the chef is. Be prepared to wait on the weekends but the wait it worth it. You get plenty of food but it can be a bit pricey. Although there is a buffet across the street from nakatos, I will always choose to pay more for quality"}
{"text":"Slow slow slow. This lunch was staffed by the B team. Sushi bar took 60 min. To make up two plates. And they are mediocre plates, no creativity, no skill. Also didn't change gloves after touching everything behind the bar. 
He even battered some fish and did not change gloves. 

Not impressed, will not be back. An hour to wait. An hour."}
{"text":"No way, don't eat here! 

If you're Muslim or alcohol intolerant/allergic, please don't eat here you will regret it. They said: \"NO ALCOHOL\", yet their soy sauce has more alcohol in it then a beer, as much as 40% alcohol.  Read the labels!"}
{"text":"Just went for sushi. Superman roll was good. Overall I would prefer Pisces or Ru Sans, but this place was nearby and it did the job. Service was also good although it wasn't busy at the time."}
{"text":"Food was great!  Service excellent only bad part was our chef was so boring, didn't talk nothing!  You pay for entertainment too not just the food! First time there I would go back but ask for an entertaining chef"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing. It was so big inside. They had two split areas for sushi and the other for hibachi. The people they serve you very quick, even if crowded. I sat at hibachi and ordered shrimp with steak. The salad was very crispy however I did not enjoy the soup. The hibachi though was AMAZING!! He blew me away with his tricks. The vegetables were very soft and flavorful. The rice had a lot of eggs and protein. The shrimp was seasoned and had a hint of lemon. That flavor with the soy sauce blended well together. The steak was very nice and tender and was seasoned well. The unique desserts they offered were really cool. I can't wait to go back there."}
{"text":"Love this place period, the food is always fresh and the guys in the sushi bar know what they are doing ask for Ricky been with them for ever and gives great suggestions, try the baked mussels they are amazing. (They even have a sushi roll names after the sushi cook)"}
{"text":"This is for lunch bento box only - haven't done the hibachi here.

Co worker and I often come here for the Udon bento box lunch - $10. Come with hot bowl of udon, four pieces of California roll, and tempura - two shrimps and veggies.
Friends have gotten sushi and ramen ($10 bento box during lunch) here as well and all have been satisfied.
Food takes time, often 20-30 minutes so prepare to wait. Rest of service is typically spot on, no complaints here.

it's a regular lunch spot for me."}
{"text":"I'm here in Charlotte on business and happened to just find this Japanese restaurant by accident and thought I would drop in to satisfy a hankerin' for sushi and sashimi created by my wife sending me awesome sushi pics from a restaurant in Austin today. Heh heh 

I haven't been compelled to write a review in a VERY long time....so either this is good or bad....unless you spaced and didn't notice the actual reading, I won't spoil it for ya. Also, I don't feel it is really needed to caveat this, but just to put this review in perspective - I am half Japanese, born and raised in Japan....so I kinda know a little bit of what to expect...just a little.  ;)

I popped in on a Tuesday night, around 7:00 pm, nice decor, seemed to be busy for a mid week night with friendly service folks. I elected to sit at the sushi bar and found myself to be the only customer at the bar. As I walked up to he bar, I looked at the fish in the cooler and immediately wanted to leave. The color of the various fish was off(as in obviously NOT fresh) but alas, blame the wife...I was determined to find some decent home country fare. I immediately noticed how unfriendly the sushi \"chef\" was. No real greeting and I sat in silence until a waitress arrived several minutes later. Ordered a Sapporo draft beer and started looking at my \"wish list\" of sashimi and sushi. I checked off the seven piece sushi dinner that also comes with a California roll($18) and also added a four piece sashimi of yellowtail(for $10) and a four piece sashimi of white tuna/escolar(for $8) and handed my sheet to the \"chef\". 

As I contemplated what hashtags to use when I undoubtedly take a pic of my dinner for Instagram and sipped my beer, my dinner was presented forth to me several minutes later (which I initially appreciated the quick turnaround) and I was again IMMEDIATELY disappointed and realized there would be no Instagramming after all. :( 

The dinner came on two plates, sushi on one and sashimi on the other. What struck me so quickly was how THIN the sashimi was cut! When I mean thin, I mean thin enough to see THROUGH the slice! Seriously, wtf??? I was OFFENDED. This \"chef\" is blatantly trying to rip people off. The whole point of sashimi is to enjoy the flavor of the fish without rice...how in the hell can I taste any fish when it is like 3mm thick??? Not to mention, the slices were sitting in little pools of water, which means these \"cuts\" of fish had been frozen for too long. Seriously. What. The. Frick. smh

The sushi platter was no better. Sloppy California roll(I freaking hate it when they include the ends of the roll!!) in some weird, rounded triangle shape that barely held together.  The sushi themselves had thicker cuts of fish and was presented better, but again, I was struck by the color of the fish. It came with a tuna, shrimp, salmon, eel, squid(I think...it was weirdly soft and not \"crisp\" as fresh squid would be and I couldn't tell by the taste either), seabass and one more I can't even remember. The tuna had a dull, magenta color(indicates it is old) and had no taste. Neither did the salmon or any of the other pieces have any taste, for that matter.  The shrimp was very dry and the other pieces lacked any.....texture. If you have enough experience with sushi and sashimi, you will know what I mean by \"texture\". Horrible, irresponsible old cuts of fish. None of the fish had any taste and these cuts, when fresh, have a VERY distinct differentiating flavor between them, but not tonight. Not here. The four cucumber pieces had the most flavor out of the entire meal....at least they were \"fresh\". 

Some of you may find this review overly harsh, but I write this specifically to share what to look for for those that do not know any better. It PISSES me off to NO END when individuals run a \"Japanese\" restaurant that is wholly not representative of my culture or the quality expected. I am a proud half-Japanese man and I take offense to those that misappropriate my country's culinary culture to just rip people off who are unsuspecting or those that do not have the experience to know any better. As for any other food offered at this establishment, I cannot comment on. However, if you are contemplating sushi and/or sashimi, take your hard earned money to an establishment that strives to do better for you and offer you a genuine Japanese culinary experience.....neither of which this restaurant is succeeding at."}

{"text":"I've been to a good number of these places because they are pretty popular for group dinners in conjunction with meetings and training classes.  Of the ones I've tried, this place ranks in the bottom third mainly because the staff was pretty unenthusiastic (except the bartender), the performance aspects were lacking and the food was uninspired.  

It doesn't help that our chef was something of a slob and didn't try very hard to do a good job with our meals.  Sauces were strewn across the table.  A co-worker who is allergic to shellfish had the shrimp appetizer deposited on his plate anyway.  Another co-worker who ordered a combo was given the wrong food.  One of my scallops was accidentally thrown into the mayo-based dipping sauce due to how the chef was slinging hash.  The grill cleaning portion resulted in a significant amount of scrapings leaving the cooking surface and landing on the table surface.  Etc, etc, etc."}
{"text":"We went to Nakato for our office holiday party luncheon.  I was first surprised by the grand entrance and then by the incredibly high ceilings and the vast amount of seating.  This place can accommodate a lot of people and not make you feel claustrophobic.  It also felt cleaner than the other Japanese steakhouse in the University area (read: Kabuto).  It probably helped that it didn't have that strip mall feeling, too.

Nakato offers sushi and other appetizers, but c'mon, who are they kidding?  People come to a Japanese steakhouse for the hibachi dinners and to be entertained while it's cooking.  Of course, the salad with ginger dressing that is served beforehand always tastes so much better than when you buy ginger dressing and pour it on your own salad at home.  Why is that?

The entertainment and ensuing food was good, as expected.  Nothing out of the ordinary; you know what you're getting into when you go to a Japanese steakhouse and we weren't disappointed.  I do recommend Nakato more than Kabuto, though.  The ambiance is better and the place feels a bit cleaner."}
{"text":"For those of you who have been to Nakato before you know that it is separated into two rooms, the sushi bar and the grill room where the chefs cook the food for you.  My experience here has only been in the sushi bar, and it was a pretty good one.  

The sushi itself was very good, fresh and really big.  It was a mouthful to eat a whole piece.  Plus I'm beginning to think it's kind of hard to mess up spider rolls, but then again I may just be spoiled.  Then there was the udon soup.  It was really good, but not any better or worse than other udon I've had.  I was kind of impresses that they had one of my friend's favorite foods, inari, that came with the soup."}
{"text":"Should have put the elastic band in the jeans before coming to Nakato...good lord! Located only 15 minutes from Uptown in the University area. Wife had a hibachi craving, and fellas, we all know how that goes...best to say, yes dear and ask where, and the \"when\" is immediately. Not going to lie, I'm glad it was hibachi and not ice cream :). 

You walk into Nakato and are greeted immediately. We made a reservation so we checked in and got a buzzer. Only strange thing was the 2 story lounge/bar area and the TV's in odd locations. No worries, just grabbed a spot on a couch while we waited. Only 2-3 minutes. Upon being sat, our waitress came by right away and she was very nice. I can tell they take their service commitment to heart. The menu is extensive with hibachi offerings. They also have sushi, so if you want that make sure to ask for that menu too. 

Went with the \"Nakato Delight\" which came with shrimp, chicken & NY steak for $23.95. Most of the entrees (combo) are around $20. For extra items or premium like filet or lobster expect and extra $5 or so. Also went with the fried rice which was $1.75...kind of annoying, but no big deal, as I like egg in my rice. Came with onion soup, salad w/ginger, shrimp app (small), noodles & veggies (surprised variety!), rice and of course the meat. I was doing fine on my \"timing\" until the the noodles & veggies came. Soup and salad...gone, no problem. Then a FULL plate of noodles/veggies...as I'm eating, I see the rice start an say oh \"SH&T\" and start to eat faster while my wife watches and is content letting her plate rise with goodness and not concerned about \"timing\". Little did I see/know as I finished shoveling the noodles/veggies that the rice had their own separate bowl and did not need a place on my plate...ha...oh well, there was room if needed now! 

Overall a great experience and for $20-$25/person average, so much food...can you say leftovers! As we got up to left I said to the table \"nice shoveling with all of you\". Not far from the truth...ha! So good!"}
{"text":"Let's start out by saying I didn't visit the teppan-yaki tables.  I went for the sushi.  I asked the sushi chef about himself and going out that \"Ricky\" was from the Philippines but had trained for a year at the hotel Nikko in Tokyo before working at the Manila Nikko. The fish is not large but fits the rice well. The rice is properly cooked and spiced.  The Saba is vinegared Ricky, the other fish is brought in prepared.  I had the poki salad, the Edemame, and sushibthe first night and a great hamachi-Kama the second.  The best sushi I've had in the US is a Yousaku in Portland Maine, the second is in a teppan-Yaki place called shiro of Japan in garden city ny, I'm not calling this third, but it is good enough for me to come a second night."}
{"text":"Nakato is a fantastic hibachi restaurant and has been my family's go-to spot for special occasion dinners for years. 

The hostesses are ALWAYS friendly and happy. The restaurant (including bathrooms) is ALWAYS spotlessly clean and an appropriate temperature (might feel chilly at first, until they turn that tabletop grill on). The chefs are ALWAYS humorous and entertaining. The food is ALWAYS delicious, not oily or heavy. Their house ginger dressing is unbelievable. This is what sets Nakato apart from other hibachi chains for me. 

There are other things on the menu and none of it is bad but honestly just order the hibachi. Choose chicken, steak, shrimp, or a combination and enjoy! It comes with soup, salad, white or fried rice, and vegetables, enough food that you will likely have leftovers for lunch the next day, for around $22 or less per person. Lunch is cheaper, but you don't get soup (boo). 

If you are celebrating a birthday or other special event they will bring you complimentary dessert for your entire table as well as taking a group photo. Back in the day this consisted of a polaroid but at some point they have upgraded to digital photos so you get a nice 5x7\" print of your entire party in a paper \"Nakato\" frame, pretty sweet.

Words of caution: It can be difficult to tell if they are open during the day. There are no windows, so you have to check the electronic \"open\" sign out front because they do close briefly between lunch and dinner. More than once I have driven by and thought they were closed when they were really open because I was just judging by number of cars in the parking lot or whatever! 

Also, if you are going with a group, they WILL NOT seat you until all members of your party have arrived. If you have a small party, they also WILL NOT put you at a partially-full table if the people at that table have already ordered. I asked once and got a vague explanation somewhere along the lines of \"we really want it to be a family-like shared experience/don't want the chef cooking for latecomers while other are already eating\". So if you really mind being a party of 2-3 and sitting at a table designed for 8, that might bug you."}
{"text":"If you want a little entertainment mixed with your meal, this is a good place to go.  This is a teppanyaki place, meaning they cook your food on a big cooktop right in front of you.  Think Benni Hanna if you're familiar with that chain.

The food is good and the service is usually pretty good too.  The one down side here, as far as service goes, is they don't start cooking until they fill up the cooking area, which if you go with a small party might add a few minutes or more to your way.  At least that was the case the times I have been.  

The regular order I have is chicken, which comes with a clear broth soup, white rice and veggies.  The soup comes from the kitchen first, but everything else is cooked right in front of you.  They also serve several sauces, which are tasty combined, by the way.  You can get the same thing with steak or shrimp instead of chicken.  For dinner the same meal also comes with a few grilled shrimp regardless of what meat you order.  They serve it as sort of an appetizer for all dinners I think.

Overall, it's a good place for some light entertainment with your meal."}
{"text":"This is our fourth visit to Nakato's and this time we were mostly pleased with our meal. Previous visits have been hit and miss. This visit was more \"hit\" than miss.

For appetizers, we started with miso soup and baked scallops. To not be jumbo scallops, they were quite pricey, but the flavor was good. We got 3 scallops for $4 a piece. That was a bit high. 

Next, we had the Gyoza. The Gyoza could either be pan fried or deep fried. The waiter didn't ask which my husband wanted and they just brought deep fried which he thought were \"ok\". We ordered the baked mussels which were good, but my husband didn't care much for the mayo topping. 

Next, they brought our sashimi plate and a spider roll. The mackerel, eel, hamichi and salmon were fresh and we were quite pleased. The sashimi was the highlight of the evening. However, the spider roll was smaller than we expected. The size was not what we had in the past.

Lastly, I ordered a small shrimp hibachi plate with vegetables and garlic noodles. The vegetables were lukewarm and it was as though the plate sat for awhile before it was brought to the table. I probably will not order that dish again.

We like Nakato's. It's a good spot to go to when you want some good sushi in the University Area. The sashimi is fresh and the presentation is somewhat artistic. Some menu items are just \"ok\" and others are a bit pricey for the amount that you do get."}
{"text":"This place is great.  My wife and I went there for our anniversary and it was delicious.  We had a sushi roll (don't remember which one) but it was very good.  We also had the hibachi dinner...I had chicken and steak, my wife and steak and shrimp.  Everything was VERY good.  Also, it is nice how they cook the food in front of you.  It is like a show and dinner.  Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch. Only tried the sushi bar this time, sushi was amazing.  The onion soup was good too.  The waiters were nice and attentive but not to the point of being annoying.  From the sounds coming from the other side the chefs were great.  Will definitely bring my kids back to try it. Gave 4 stars instead if 5 because the frozen drink that I got was weak."}
{"text":"Never again!    We had a party of 9 and we had to wait for all to arrive.   Our reservation was 6:30, by 7:30 we were told we had to wait another 30 minutes because there was only one chef.   Really!   Ending up leaving and going to TGIF.
Sorry I won't recommend."}
{"text":"I was super disappointed with my trip here.
I got the filet and scallop lunch which ended up costing about $20+ dollars. The waitress didn't remember my friend wanted shrimp AND chicken... Also didn't remember my other friend wanted steak. Two of us said we didn't want noodles so she didn't give us noodles or veggies...my steak was cooked well done not med rare as I ordered. My scallops were extremely overcooked. I had to go to bathroom and spit it out it was so hard. Not worth the money. There are cheaper options that taste way better (ie Toyama)"}
{"text":"The best sushi place I've been to since moving to North Carolina! Wonderful atmosphere, quick and friendly service, fresh tasting sushi and reasonable prices! Hot towels are brought to you as soon as you sit down! There is a full bar and the sushi bar is very nice! Haven't tried the hibachi yet but am excited to and looking forward!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Not all filler. Well prepared sushi. I thoroughly enjoyed the smoked squid salad. I will definitely eat here again on my next trip through Charlotte."}
{"text":"Come here once a month (just for Sushi) - always delicious, always consistent.  Come with a group and we are located in various places around the US so we are comparing it to what we like in our respective cities.  All agree that this matches up to our local favorites and is definitely the best place for Sushi in this part of town."}
{"text":"I brought a co-worker here for a business dinner while in town and thought it was great. We had some downtime when we first sat to talk about work and then enjoyed a great, reasonably priced, hibachi. Portions were abundant."}
{"text":"On my way to a movie in Concord and I was craving some sushi....I thought of Nakato I had been once before for lunch and remember it being pretty good.  I've never eaten the hibachi - but they have a decent sushi bar, prices are a little high, and they lack on selection when it comes to rolls.  I really enjoyed my miso soup, and tuna tataki though.  If i'm in the area I'd come back but I wouldn't drive out of my way."}
{"text":"We are sushi connoisseurs - Nokato has the best around here. The ingredients are fresh, tasty and the guys making the sushi know what they are doing."}
{"text":"Great great great!  That's how I would describe my experience at Nakato.  The service was great, my fellow vegan yelper was told all about menu choices by are waitress, something you don't often get at a restaurant.  The drinks (Mai Tai's) were delish and very strong at that!  What made the dinner though, aside from the great company, was the food itself.  The soups and salads were amazing, the chef was fun and efficient.  I had the shrimp and chicken hibachi combo - and I honestly had no complaints...you get fried rice, a salad, soup, noodles, and the shrimp and chicken - it was sooo much food!  The sauces they provide are tasty with free refills, and the chef was on top of it the whole night.  If you are in the university area and are looking for a really nice Japanese hibachi grill, Nakato is definitely worth a trip, I certainly will be back!"}
{"text":"When we walked in was a bit concerned looked huge and empty... Guess it gets busy end of week. We ate a sushi bar.  They did not have all items available but the sushi was good and reasonably priced. Service ok."}
{"text":"Oh, no!!  Maybe I'm spoiled but what is a crab stick??  There is no hamachi Kama sushi, only grilled. Does that make sense?  The food doesn't have any flavor. The sushi guy has major attitude. The sushi is not worth your time. How do you screw up shrimp tempura appetizer?  I know.. Don't cook the vegetables long enough so you're biting into hard vegetables. And the shrimp you can get as Costco for cheaper. This is a pass!!"}
{"text":"Just so typical for a Japanese Hibachi grill, nothing special it all taste the same when it comes of that griddle.  I ordered Sushi as well and was not impressed by the quality or serving size.  I believe it was the Panther roll, not even good enough to recall the name."}
{"text":"This is the main hibachi place we go to because they never disappoint. Food and service is always good. Prices are normal for hibachi restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is incredible for sushi!! Sat at the bar and watched our chef make our rolls which my daughter loved! My wife got an order of Kama which was a grilled yellow tail cheek!!! So good!! And the wait staff was incredibly attentive!!"}
{"text":"Honestly one of my favorite hibachi places when I have the time to sit. Food is very consistent which is what I love most about it. One of the few places that is made to order and offers hibachi scallops(one of my favorite dishes). The portions are perfect because they give you enough to eat that night and enough for another meal at home. Of course, you can't go wrong with the entertainment from the chefs and the service is on point. I've yet to find a place that beats this in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Not bad at all.  Service was a little slow at first but then a second sushi chef came out!   I'll let you know if I get sick or not!?!?   Fish looked a little sketchy at first, off color.  :o/"}
{"text":"Me and my husband loved the sushi bar! Great service and fast! Enjoyed the environment, nice and quiet atmosphere! Nice bar and the alcoholic beverages are really good! We enjoyed our visit!"}

Strikeouts-0/3

Edit: came back for round 2 sushi, 5 stars!!
Ala carte: fatty tuna, white fish, yellow tail,  mackerel, eel(two kinds), salmon roe, raw sweet shrimp and a tuna roll.

Rice=good, seaweed=good, fish=quality!
Definitely getting bang for buck, and probably best in Charlotte, because there's nothing that compares in a 15 km radius. 

*I really really want to give this 5 stars, but I can't without going back there again. It's also very biased towards the sushi side and not the teppanyaki. I sat at the sushi bar ordered omakase without barely looking at the menu at all. Little did I not know that the omakase was sashimi and not nigiri. This threw me off. I love my nigiri style and was tempted to give it back, but the chef looked pretty proud when he gave it to me, so I took it without saying anything. For once, I don't regret it!! Expectations were super low, came out of that dinner super happy.

The menu specifically said 18 pieces, and there was definitely about 24 pieces. So glad they were stingy on the amount of pieces. There was variety, a wide range that most places wouldn't give for $25 dollars USD. My top three of the dish was the yellow tail(hamachi), the white tuna(butter fish!), and sweet shrimp. I actually mistakenly took the yellow tail as fatty tuna due to the dark hue colour that it had. Typically it would be much brighter and would have more of a distinct colour gradient. Nonetheless, it tasted so rich. Typically I don't like hamachi that much since it lacks flavour, but this was like a gusher in my mouth! The white tuna was very surprising too, since I'm used to tasting it right after it's been defrosted too long or too soon. This was a perfect balance between not too rich and not too bland. The most impressive part of the dinner was The sweet shrimp. It was served raw! Why is that surprising? Most places cook it. I would say 99% of sushi restaurants serve it cooked. This chef not only had a good raw sweet shrimp that was meaty and juicy, but he also deep fried the head and gave that to me. I ate it while leaving nothing behind. It was a GLORIOUS dinnerXD. Definitely need to come back and order a la carte."}
{"text":"Good sushi. Didn't get the Teppan Yaki (chop chop) food....didn't want anything too heavy before my French class! Got the Hawaiian Poke Salad as an \"app\" and it was very tasty....Then a \"Panther\" roll which featured Tuna, Eel, cream cheese and avocado with some crunchy \"stuff\" up top, drizzled with their Eel sauce (by the way, just what the heck is \"Eel sauce?\")???? It's yummy nonetheless. Check out the pics. Recommended. I've had their chop chop stuff at the Pineville location, and that too is quite good. Overall a good place to grab some chow!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed our meal here. I'm a big fan of the teppanyaki experience, and wasn't disappointed. It was a little pricier than I expected, but not TOO outrageous. The chef was talented, and our food was tasty. I might try some other places like this, just to compare, but we'll probably be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a great time at Nakato. I ordered the shrimp tempura appetizer to get started. It was mediocre, a little too greasy and bland for my taste. I had lobster for the main course, it was great! It is a little bit different from what I am familiar with at arigatos in Greensboro but that's okay. The fried rice was good, but the shrimp was meh. I had a enjoyable dining experience given the mixed circumstance, I love the social aspect of dining at a place like this"}
{"text":"Had a reservation for 15 people. Arrived before the reservation by 15 min and still waited about 45 min before we were seated. Once we were seated. A cook won't show up till about 30 minutes later. Everyone in my group that day will leave a bad review as well. Horrible customer service. Horrible front desk girls. You can go to your local Japanese place and get the same exact food for a fraction of the price. Actually tsunami in concord has more better customer service than this place."}
{"text":"It's fun and Yummy!

Had a blast with our group and our chef was impressive with his \"art\" and funny too...

Food was good, and surprising considering the chef was cooking it all there.

Fast! Fast service and delivery... It's not a place to string along a meal. You are served a lot o food and its one portion after another...

I'm coming back."}
{"text":"I like the style of Japanese steakhouses, and this place doesn't disappoint.  Went with a family of 6 and all had a good time.  Ordered an appetizer but the timing of its delivery didn't mesh with the rest of the meal.  

Only ding I give is for my family having 4 kids they do the \"automatic gratuity\" thing that only serves to lower the total tip I give.  This is a practice that needs to die or get a more reasonable threshold."}
{"text":"I have dined here many times over many years. We usually dine in the sushi bar area. The service and quality of their food has been consistently excellent. Their sushi/ sashimi is fresh and prepared well. I have tried many items from their hibachi made to order menu and have never been disappointed. I love that they present you with a hot bath cloth prior to your meal. The manager is very friendly and makes sure you had a good experience."}
{"text":"This is one of the cleanest and well kept hibachi houses ive ever patronized. The cooks are both friendly and skilled, and servers are prompt and personable. I thoroghly enjoyed the experience!"}
{"text":"Great experience and delicious food. The staff surprised our daughter with a birthday cake after our meal. We even got a framed picture of it. Great job to the cook and staff."}
{"text":"The food is always very good. However do not order food to go. I ordered food to-go and the portion size is drastically different. My to-go looks like to portion I normally take Home from dining-in. It's a rip-off. I provided feedback and the manager said they weight the food. Somebody had their thumb on the scale. Smh."}
{"text":"Came in here due to high Yelp reviews and was very close to the Courtyard where I stayed.  The hibachi and sushi were both VERY good and the $3 Yuengling drafts are great also!  The food was all excellent and our chef was friendly and fun to watch. It's pretty much your typical hibachi experience but good prices and good food!  Recommend!!"}
{"text":"Love love love sushi. This was my daughters first visit to this restaurant and she said she really enjoyed it. She loves the fact that the food is prepared right in front of you and the fire and knife performance was great. The food as always was awesome and the waiter was great. He was very helpful and patient with her. Great first time experience for her."}
{"text":"Visit date on 10/20/2017-  This was my family and I first time at Nakato Japanese Steakhouse. 

-The Chef (the guy that was cooking the food) was NOT FUN or Entertaining as the others Chef that I seen there. Kind of wish we another Chef 

- The food was good and was all worth it! You will get a LOT of food, might even have some to take home.

- I  was kind of a upset, because for party of 5 or more they charge you gratuity. Which it was just my kids, my husband and I. I think places should change that rule if its children, It's just not fair.  That's just like telling family not to have more than to kids of you are married.... I'm just saying. 

- The inside was nice and it's really big. A perfect place to have a party. They even have private rooms if you need it.  

- The kids meal comes with a LOT of food!!"}
{"text":"Note this is at the sushi bar, not the hibachi grills.  Service was rude and the sushi was worst have had in a long time.  Fish was not as fresh as needs to be and the craftsmanship of the sushi chefs was very poor.  This place is a no go for sushi fans."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! I can't wait to go back! Went with my boyfriend on a Sunday evening, we ordered the Pacific Fried roll, the Superman roll, teriyaki chicken, teriyaki squid, and a side of rice. Both of the sushi rolls were AMAZING, seriously some of the best sushi I've ever had! It's obvious they have a very experienced sushi chef. The staff was friendly but they did switch off a little and got our teriyaki squid confused (we ordered it cajun and it came out plain). The restaurant itself was very beautiful, minimally designed and very open and bright, and they bring you hot towels before your meal. We sat in the sushi bar area and it was very quiet and peaceful, even though it is next to a cook-in-front-of-you performance area. From what I overheard of that, it sounded a lot less obnoxious than some other Japanese steakhouses I've been to where the chef is more concerned with cracking jokes than cooking food. I did not get that vibe from Nakato and cannot wait to go back with a group and sit around the grill. Very satisfied.

Oh and PS, this would be a great place to take a date! Sit in the sushi bar if you want a more intimate, relaxing evening or sit around a grill if you want a more exciting night!"}
{"text":"We sat at the sushi bar. The sushi chef was decent. It was an hour before closing so the sushi did not taste fresh. We did have good service from the staff."}
{"text":"Just visiting Charlotte and tried this place out seems to be a big building with a lot of tables.  Of course being a Tuesday night it was super slow and it didn't take long to be seated.  Server was friendly and did a good job keeping drinks full.  The food wasn't bad but it just wasn't great.  They did give you a lot. Maybe it was just me but the sauce they put on everything wasn't what I'm used to and was just so so.  Also not sure why rice was in a bowl and not on the plate but to each his own.  Overall not bad food but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"In the style of Beni Hana but a little \"up scale\". The seating and service was prompt and courteous. The food ( steak and scallops) was totally delish.  In a departure from similar restaurants, noodles instead of bean sprouts were served with the vegetables. Next time I visit Charlotte (from the left coast) this place will definitely be on the itinerary!"}
{"text":"I've been to several Japanese restaurant and this one is by far the best!! Locals or anyone from out of town this is definitely a must try!! They offer sushi and hibachi and BOTH ARE DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"Lets just say... This place knows how to cut costs! I know that the economy has been hard on everyone, but whoa. I commend this restaurant for taking actions to minimize the amount they spend. This nice restaurant I believe sunk $5 million dollars on the property. Now, I'm going to update my review from my 2011 review. And the outcome, as you can tell by the stars is ummm... not good.

Now, lets start off by the menu. I came with a party of 5 and we all got seated down at the hibachi grill. Menu is pretty standard as far as hibachi grill food items goes. I came to Nakato because from word, the owner owns a farm out in Colorado and farm raises all the animals and also their freezer blast freezes their seafood. This is an important fact because when you blast freeze seafood, it's usually 50 or more below 0 degrees Fahrenheit keeping the seafood fresh and bacteria free. So, this was definitely a reason to try this restaurant out.

So, lets get back to the menu. Looking at the items something pops out. Fried Rice..$1.75. So, fried rice doesn't come standard with the meal that costs $15+? Steam rice on the other hand is free (which I picked). I ordered the combination of Chicken and NY strip. My party all got the fried rice when it was asked because they were under the assumption that it came with the meal, and I'll break down to you what that fried rice consisted of.

Fried rice: Eggs, Sesame seed, and Soy Sauce. That's it. No green onions, carrots, and all that other good stuff. On top of the lack of extras with the fried rice it had no taste. Bland.

Meats that I ordered weren't bad on the other hand, but the portions were a little too small in my opinion. Their noodles that also came with the meal wasn't filling, and just left me a feeling of not full but at the same time not hungry. And mind, I ate two of my party's portion on noodles.

We also had some tempura. The tempura, I had no taste for it. I've definitely had better. The batter had no taste, as well as the sauce. The veggies that was served in the batter surprised my mother, which found out it was just a whole half of an onion dipped and fried in the tempura. She also wanted to tell me that what made it worse was that the onion had no flavor, the batter, and on top of all that the sauce!

Finally lets get on with the end when we pay our bills.
Sitting with us at our grill was another party of 5, 3 kids and 2 adults. One of the child's birthday happened to be that day. So, you usually get a dessert, or a cupcake, or some ice cream right? Not here! This lucky girl got a nice candle, in a sauce dish. Well, they did sing the birthday song to her.

But wait! That's not it! The table sitting directly across from us also had a birthday. So, they take the candle the little girl just blew out and lights it again to give it to the other birthday person. Mind, these meals cost I believe $15+. Easily.

Way to cheap out your customers there, Nakato. Charge extra for fried rice that's bland, and some pretty expensive dishes, with no complimentary birthday dessert. Now, that's how you run a business: Cutting costs, and try to recuperate losses."}
{"text":"I'm deathly allergic to Mushrooms and Carrots. So they said that they would cook it in the back, so there is no contamination. They brought out my salad... It had carrots in it. Then they brought out my fried rice. It had tiny bits of Carrots in it! The chef Tuan, he Noticed it ! 

It wasn't the Display Chef's fault! In fact I applaud him for his vigilantes!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! We enjoyed that they are one of the hibachi places that actually uses the ginger sauce on the side to dip with. The early bird special they currently run at $13 for a chicken and steak combo is an amazing deal too. They also serve noodle as well as the normal fried rice."}
{"text":"Poor service, super salty no friendly at all and of course the food was terrible ...."}
{"text":"We dined here for lunch.  It was not a busy, but every thing was great from the food to the service.  We all enjoyed the hibachi and the sauces were excellent!"}
{"text":"The customer service was excellent and the sushi was really excellent. 49er roll & crazy wasabi roll were superb"}
{"text":"Good average Japanese steakhouse for hibachi but this isn't Benihana...at all.


I went to this location after seeing all of the reviews on yelp, which were mostly positive but I saw a few things wrong.

The hosted greeted me and my date immediately, and got us seated quickly since it was a Monday night and virtually empty except for the hibachi area, which was what I came for.

Seating is wierd here, they had half empty hibachi tables but insisted on putting me and my date at an empty table. Part of the hibachi experience is the show, which is usually better when their are more than two people at a table of eight!!! People trailed in the door but only a group of three were sat at our table and at the other end...what?


The food made up the bad seating, I had the Nakato Delight, and chose the NY strip instead of the filet. It was great....steak was cooked perfectly, shrimp not overdone and the chicken was tasty. The hibachi chef was in good spirits, although he gave up on the entertainment portion of his job since the group of three across from us were ignoring him and kept talking amongst themselves.

This Nakato has a nice albeit dated interior, but much better than the run down Kabuto on Pineville Matthews. The prices were in line with most hibachi places, 18 for chicken and around 22+ for combos. And you will have leftovers for sure!"}
{"text":"The food here was really good, especially for the amount that they give you. We all left with leftovers and that's saying a lot because I almost never leave places with leftovers lol. The restaurant itself was nice and has plenty of space inside. The staff was helpful but took too long with our drink orders. Overall, a great laid back hibachi spot to get some good food"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with everything this place had to offer besides the sushi. That is the only reason I gave this place one star instead of zero. The rice smelt funny (like wet dog) and the food was lacking flavor. They serve noodles with the meal and it tasted like they put 7 cloves of garlic in there and was very hard to eat. Everyone was nice and friendly but the food was crappy. I went there because the rating said 4/5 stars and I felt lied to .  I can't believe the reviews came from the same place. I hate to write a bad review but dang it was awful."}
{"text":"I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, but my company has an office in the University area of Charlotte, and I often have to take colleagues to dinner.  Nine times out of ten, I'll pick this place because 1) it's fun, 2) it's reasonably priced,  3) it's delicious and 4) it's fun.

I love sushi, but I don't usually get it here because I'm all about the hibachi table.  Your party is seated at the table and the waitress and assistant take your drink and food orders (I always get the steak and shrimp combination), and soon afterwards you have a salad and soup in front of you.  A hibachi chef (admittedly of varying talents) arrives with a cart of food, and he confirms your orders.

Most of the hibachi chefs are pretty good.  They twirl the spatula a bit, serve the sauce, cut up some shrimp and set the table on fire (in an onion ring chimney).  Pretty fun.  The good chefs can do some pretty cool things with eggs and shrimp tails.  You wonder how they keep their fingers considering how quickly they throw their knives around, but last time I checked, they all had 10 fingers.

Then they start cooking the food en masse, and I'm always impressed with how quickly they serve an entire table of 14 within 20 minutes.  Next thing you know, the chef scrapes the table, cleans it, and bids you good night.

The food is usually excellent, they have perfect seafood and ginger sauces to complement the natural flavors, and they keep your drinks/water glasses full.

Great food, great time, and a reasonable price.  Hence 5 stars."}
{"text":"love it here! esp the early bird special chicken and steak if you are there before 6pm!"}
{"text":"Tremendous! First time here, the restaurant itself has a nice open feel to it when you walk in, we sat at the sushi bar. The staff were all very friendly and attentive, the ginger dressing on the salad was different than any other place I've been (in a good way), miso soup was good... sushi was awesome! Next time I'll have to try some of the specialty rolls, they looked GOOOOD.
Prices are fair, it's not the cheapest sushi around but the quality is there which is more important (to me) than price. 
I'll be back for more.... :-)"}
{"text":"Had dinner out with my girlfriend tonight. Andy at the bar took great care of us. The sushi was awesome! The inside is beautiful and a perfect spot for date night. The drink specials for monday when we went included half price wine bottles and cheap beers. So great drink specials, great service and food. We are glad we stopped in and stayed for dinner instead of doing takeout."}
{"text":"I've been to Nakato twice now, both times for lunch.  One time I sat at the Hibachi Grill, and one time I sat in the small sushi bar seating area.  In comparison, I would say sitting at the grill was a more satisfying experience, minus the preparation time.  

At the table, I ordered the Bento Box A.  In this box was a 4 piece California roll, teriyaki chicken, fried rice and vegetables.  I requested stir fried vegetables instead of the tempura vegetables it came with.  All portions were good except the chicken.  It was very small.

At the grill you had the traditional hibachi experience, which I enjoyed.  The food was plentiful, as it usually is with hibachi.  The chefs were entertaining and it was a table of all people you could tell worked in the local area.

I would like to come back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Big fan of Nakatos for some years now. I only visit her for the Hibaci . Hibaci is served for lunch and dinner. There is also a sushi menu, however I've never tried it. I really enjoy the Hibaci noodles, miso soup , and Hibaci scallops. The fried rice is really delicious too. The server team and chef are ALWAYS friendly, I have never in the 5 or more year I've been going there had a bad experience with anyone . They want you to be happy, so they go above and beyond to do so. Definitely a family friendly place as well."}
{"text":"I've been eating Sushi for 23 years and they serve the worst sushi I've ever had!!!!! The service was bad as well! The Sushi was served very fast because no one was ordering it!! I wish someone told me it would be the biggest waste of 120.00 I've ever spent!!! I'll never return!"}
{"text":"Food was delish.  We had the seafood combo which included salmon scallops and Shrimp and the Filet Mignon and Shrimp.  All dishes come with soup, salad, shrimp appetizer noodles and rice.  Great food at economical prices. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Quick! Slice it up, dice it, throw it in the air, and juggle that food!  Light it on fire, put it out!  Alright calm down and relax, cherish your shrimp sauce, hell let your food take a bath in it.  Now throw back some saki and order another course.  

Nakatos is an exciting food experience, I love coming here on my birthday or when I come across a nice stack of cash.  The wait staff is so accommodating and friendly, they enjoy their work-and you can tell.  

Sometimes I was seated across from complete strangers, but it wasn't awkward or uncomfortable at all; everyone is so happy to be here.  You will be too."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for many years now and have no complaints about the hibachi grill food. It's always fresh and good! Whenever I'm in the mood for Japanese and have approx 1 hour to enjoy my lunch (and have a healthy appetite!) I come here on my lunch break. The noodles are by far my favorite part of the meal, I just love them! I've had the chicken, shrimp, steak, scallops  over the years many times and they've all been delicious. Fried rice is super yummy too but is an up charge - $2 I think? (outside of lunch hours) which I think is crazy. Other places in the area don't do this and I think it's just a way for them to make an extra buck. I do pay it though bc I really like the fried rice. Unless you really want an alcoholic beverage save your $$, the beer on tap is often flat and mixed drinks are expensive and nothing that great. I'm not a huge sake fan but it's your average sake. The chefs are so-so, of course they can cook! But I like a show...it's hit or miss if you get a good one. They do good for coming out, talking with you, making adjustments, etc. Wait staff is pretty good but there are some bad ones as with all restaurants. If you get a good/great chef & waitress please tip them well (20%) as they share with each other. I do think that's fair as we out the chef through some grief at the table! 
Can't speak on the sushi as surprisingly I've never had theirs...but looks like others have so be sure to read their reviews! 
On Friday & Saturday nights you will have a long wait so I'd recommend a reservation, even if it's just 2 of you, which will get you placed in a sectioned off portion where you have to take off your shoes...be forewarned! All tables seat about 10 on each side so you'll sit with strangers if you don't have a large group. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's ok, the wait time was very long. I didn't care for the side salad it had way to much ginger in it. Most Japanese restaurants I've been to normally have a little sweetness in their dressing but their was horrible and on top of that was super thick. The onion soup was not as good either I definitely didn't taste any onions, tasted more like beef broth. But on the good side they do give you a good amount of food."}
{"text":"Great staff and environment. Food was good and portion sizes more than enough. Great family dining experience."}
{"text":"Me and wife love this place. It is our favorite Sushi place. Love the atmoshere, the decore, the staff, the hot towels, and of course the food. They have a beverage and a sushi bar. This is also a Japenese Steak House, but we mostly come here for the sushi. They have 16 Teppanyaki Tables in the main dinning room and 4 more tables in private roomd that you do not need a reservation for, but you have to take your shoes off and sit on the floor."}
{"text":"I went to the sushi bar for dinner and the sushi and sashimi were very good. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. I'll definitely come again when I'm in town again"}
{"text":"WE went for sushi, and sat at the sushi bar on a Saturday night.  The sushi list was long, but kind of repetitive, and a lot of the rolls had the same ingredients.  The rolls we did get were fresh and were made quickly.  To supplement the lack of rolls with various ingredients, I ordered nigiri.  Honestly, this is hands down the best sushi place in the University area.  Kabuto doesn't seem as fresh and any other place is whack.  Ru Sans will forever wear the sushi crown in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"After receiving a few recommendations about this place, I must say I'm glad we went there. Upon arrival the host was a bit stoic, didn't smile, however he was polite and escorted us to our table, which you have an option of being seated at the sushi bar or hibachi. 

Our chef was very friendly, personable and seemed to recognize everyone there, as he remarked to us, \"haven't seen you before\", then he proceeds to explain what he's about to do and proudly puts on a lil knife skill show. 

The food was really good, was not a fan of the ginger that comes on the salad, you really get your money's worth. Along with the salad you get soup, shrimp, noodles (kinda dry), but everything else was 100. I opted for the shrimp and scallops and my husband had the shrimp and steak which was cooked exactly to his liking.  Again, our chef continued to ensure we were satisfied with the quality of the food, made sure you had plenty of sauce and was an absolute delight. Oh, btw you have the option of getting fried rice for a little extra. I strongly recommend that,  the white rice was sticky and gummy. 
 We will definitely be going back and take a few more with us"}
{"text":"A Benihana like restaurant near our hotel and where we dined for a team dinner on a week night. They do not seat you until your entire party is here, but sink into one of their leather couches in front. You will not want to get up.

Our party of 16 or so sat at 2 grill tables, circled around. I knew off the bat I didn't want teppanyaki, so I asked for a sushi menu. I started with the hawaiian poke salad (mix of salmon and tuna) and then two rolls. The 49'er roll (ode to the SF Niners) which was a CA roll with smoked salmon, spicy aoili (fancy word of spicy mayo) and scallions. I also went with another typical favorite roll of mine, the Rock N Roll, a crunchy roll with spicy tuna and smelt roe on top. 

Everyone was served salads and soup, and I also had a nice bottle of hot sake. Although I prefer cold sake, this one hit the spot. Service was great, but when the show began, we were definitley at the dull table. The other cook put on a fun and exciting show, doing tricks and everything you would normally see. Ours was...the quite opposite. When I asked him where our fun show was, he did a volcano thing with the onion, and THE END. 

The hawaiian poke salad was okay, too much sauce that was overwhelming. The rolls on the other hand were delicious! I was surprised at the freshness of the fish, and I liked how they didnt clump so much rice on the rolls. And surprisingly I was still hungry! Usually I can barely eat two rolls, but I was still wanting more! I decided to order another, the Spicy Snow, salmon, cucumber, and jalapeno. My coworker and I also shared an order of 4 pieces of fatty tuna. That was amazing, but for $32, the slices were awfully thin. Everyone seemed to enjoy their teppanyaki, and the noodles were good too. They do seem to cook their steak very well, so tell them your liking if you prefer it more raw.

My roll took forever, and people were wrapping up so I asked for it to go. It was delicious but the jalapenos were HOT! After one burning my lip, I had to take them all off.

We had two birthdays and I asked them for their options. Ice cream is free, but a birthday cake, song, and photo was $10. We opted for the latter, and the birthday gals enjoyed their treat. The cake looks almost home made, but maybe store bought. Its a good size for about 6-8 people, and it was really light and delicious! 

Overall, a great experience! Would come back again for the sushi! Service was great in the beginning but as more and more diners came in, it seemed harder to get a hold of the waitresses. I do appreciate them turning on the channel for the A's/Tigers game for my avid A's fan coworker."}
{"text":"Early bird special Sun thru Thurs from 5pm till 6pm, $11.95. Ichiban! DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYTHING ELSE AFTER 6PM."}
{"text":"Domo Aragato for Nakato!!!!
Yum is all I can say!!  Walking in to a grand foyer to be greeted by friendly hostess' and a minimal wait for the hibachi!  SO we mosied on over to the bar and made the decision to hit the mai tai!  Something fantastical about that drink!  LOL...  Once we made it to the hibachi grill the waitress took our order,being vegan I asked if they would be able to avoid the egg in the rice, once I said that she immediately offered all suggestions for me to eat!  I was shocked at the offering, usually not a normal approach from the wait staff!!  The MISO soup was by far the most flavorful that I've ever had!  It was flavor explosion in my mouf! (that's right... I called it a mouf)...  The vegetables with tofu were phenomenal as well and the pricing was moderate, moderate high, but for two full meals and a round of drinks for half the gaggle (two people) it was right on key... about 50 bucks or so!  
Take your friends here if you wanna impress them with one of Charlotte's finest!  hands down 5 stars!  Can I throw in a comet!  Cuz this place is outta dis world!  :))"}
{"text":"I liked it a lot, fresh food good ambience! The staff was great with accommodating my shellfish allergy. I would definitely return and the drinks were great."}
{"text":"We arrived at 7:50 for a o'clock reservation did not get seated in till 825. Had to ask for a waitress at 8:40. Finally ordered and then walked out at 9:15. The worst service I have ever had at this restaurant they have gone way downhill"}
{"text":"This is the best Japanese steakhouse I've ever been to in a long time. The food is outstanding, the wait staff is friendly and accommodating, and the seating doesn't make you feel like you have to rub elbows with your neighbor. 

The place is divided into 2 sections. The hibachi grills and the sushi bar. You have a choice of sitting in chairs at the hibachi grills or going into 1 of their rooms where you have to take your shoes off and sit down on the floor (they provide pillows). I haven't had the chance to sit on the floor yet, so I won't include that in my review.

You make your selections off the menu and have some time to sit and chat with other people at the table. Their iced tea is always perfect (whether you get sweet or not), and your glass is always full. 

The 1st items to come out are the ginger salad and soup. I normally pass on the soup, but I love their ginger salad. It's not over powering with ginger like most dressings that are in this category.

Next comes the appetizers and sushi. I would recommend the calamari steaks (but don't take left overs home, they don't save well) and for the sushi, try the one that has \"Pacific or Pacifica\" in the name (sorry, I can't remember what it's called). Every time my husband and I have their sushi, it's always fresh and tastes wonderful. 

The entertainment begins when the chef comes out to cook your meal. I like how they confirm your order and they pay special attention to any modifications that you've made to your order. This part is great for kids. They cut the tails off of the shrimp and throw them in their hat, light an onion stack on fire and make a train noise with the spatula, and they do an egg roll before throwing it in the air and breaking it in half on the spatula! The meal portions are reasonable and get extra shrimp sauce (it's the pink stuff)! Of course, everything is nice and hot when it hits your plate and fresh because it's cooked right there in front of you. On my first trip there, I was pleasantly surprised that I wasn't hot from the grill (yes, I've been to some places where I was sweating when the cooking was finished).

If you have a birthday, this is a great place to go! You get your meal like always and they give you a cake (that is so sweet, your teeth will rot with 1 bite), they sing to you in Japanese, and you get your picture taken and it is framed (a paper frame, but hey it's still cool lookin).

I can keep going on and on about how great this place is. I will keep going back until they close! I do have to point out, if you're not careful, the bill can get a bit high if you keep adding all the goodies they offer. If you want a good comparison, go to Kabuto's and then Nakato's and you'll see a huge difference."}
{"text":"Delicious! Try the Carolina Panthers drink. Color was pretty spot on. Service was a little slow. Our chef was good."}
{"text":"I stopped in here while staying at the hotel next door on business. Ordered a seaweed salad, shrimp tempura app and one sushi roll. The seaweed salad had great flavor, the tempura was good as well. The roll was nothing fancy but had real crab in it and the avocado was perfectly ripe. Service was quick, I was in and out in less than thirty minutes. Will be back if I stay in this neck of the woods again."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! I have a shellfish allergy and my food has to be cooked in the back....after asking the waitress to repeatedly check on my food it still didn't come out until everybody had finished eating!"}
{"text":"While the atmosphere was nice, I did not enjoy the food. It was probably the least delicious hibachi I have ever been to. They should revise their sushi menu as well. I felt that my roll was not fresh and had been made days ago. The cook was not very good either and could not do any of the traditional hibachi tricks. I would not recommend this hibachi. Definitely overpriced!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. We found this place on Yelp after going to another sushi place who's parking lot was empty. We didn't think it was a good sign to find an empty parking lot and this place was in miles. 

I had the spicy spicy tuna roll and my friend has a la cart from the menu.

We both enjoyed our meal. One of the best sushi bars I have been to."}
{"text":"Well, it's a good thing I wore a flowy dress and an adjustable slide belt to dinner at Nakato. Not only did my belt \"adjust\" on its own, but hubs and I took home a combined box of leftovers that fed us for a few meals afterwards, too!

I was craving hibachi like crazy, so we drove on up to the University area to score some tasty Japanese grill cookin'. Nakato is a pretty standard looking Japanese hibachi grill but also expect super high ceilings in the foyer/bar area and expansive rooms with the traditional grills. Both our server and our chef were very friendly but no overly so. Hubs and I still had enough quiet time to chat or just watch our chef flip and twist the shrimp & rice in peace. 

So, where does Nakato really shine? Through the boatload of food that they dole out. It's almost ridiculous. My shrimp & chicken hibachi combo ($18.25) came with: Nakato onion soup, salad with ginger dressing, shrimp appetizer (literally two chopped up shrimp), a bowl full of rice (I paid $1.75 for the Hibachi fried rice), a hearty helping of noodles, grilled vegetables, shrimp and chicken. ZOMG. All of the food was truly tasty, especially when you added a bit of the \"yummy\" sauce that the chef provided. It.Was.So.Much.Food. I think my favorite was the shrimp, veggies and noodles. Nom. 

My only mini gripe about Nakato is the flavor - I would have liked to have a little more heat or spice in my meal, but otherwise it was exactly what I was looking for. Next time I'm craving 100 pounds of food and some mild entertainment, I'll come back to this Nakato in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I've been on a roll when lately when It comes to good food. Each new restaurant I've tried has been amazing. It was only a matter of time before my luck ran out. 
Came here after work on a Thursday night. Seeing the other Yelp reviews, I would've never picked this place myself but it's a company dinner so why not? 
Worst meal I've had in a long time. 
We were seated then immediately a server came by for our drinks. No introduction, no chit chat, nothing. Just a quick \"what do you want to drink?\" And that's It. We all order and then wait for our show to start. The chef came out with no greeting, no enthusiasm and barely any tricks at all. We got the flaming onion volcano and the shrimp tail in the hat. That's It. During our two hour dinner, that was the extent of our entertainment. I've been to several Japanese steakhouses and always get a nice show. This one was not a show. We sat there in silence and watched him cook our food. 
Now for the food. The onion soup was pretty good. Basic but good. The salad however was so ice cold, it hurt my teeth to chew and the dressing was not good at all. I've had better ginger dressing from a bottle off the shelves at target. The food didn't get any better from there. First of all, you pay an extra $2 for fried rice. What kind of nickel and dime cheating is that? You're already stir frying everything- we have to pay extra to add rice to the grill? Anyhoo - It wasn't even worth It. I ordered shrimp and steak. The steak was cooked medium which is how I like It but there was barely any flavor otherwise. Noodles, veggies, rice, steak and shrimp were all missing the bit of oomph you'd expect to get for the price you pay. And the sauces? Oh man. Watered down bland replicas if what's supposed to be ginger and shrimp sauce. I'm so disappointed. Wasted calories on horrible food. Save your money and go to a place that actually gives you your money's worth."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Went on a Tuesday night with no wait!  Best hibachi I have ever had.  Was traveling in the area but will definitely come if I am ever in the area again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the hibachi but have not got the chance to try there sushi yet. They are fast and the food is great. The cook was friendly and my meal was great and everything id expect from a hibachi restraunt. Its a little pricey but all kinds of places this style usually are but all in all its a good eat"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with Nakato. We went on a Friday night, and it was pretty busy. My girlfriend and I ordered sushi at the sushi bar, along with gyoza appetizer and some fried rice. The sushi was very fresh and flavorful (I had a Carolina roll as well as a spicy tuna roll, and they were great!). The gyoza was on point, and the fried rice was done right. I will be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"They clearly are worried more about their bottom line than the customer service.  Our poor waitress was completely  over extended, leaving all her tables lacking service and aggravated.   The cook was great.  And the waitress was trying her hardest.    I put the blame of all the many many  issues on management.       Provide the proper amount of staffing to help out your staffs tips and customers experience."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious sushi!!! Highly recommend the volcano roll. The ginger salad is one of the best tasting ones I've had. The service was excellent even when it was close to closing time! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I went to Nakato today for lunch for the first time ever based on the sushi reviews and the proximity to my job.  I got seated immediately as their lunch rush was pretty much over.  My waitress was prompt and efficient without being annoying.  She kept my water full and remembered the lemon which is always a plus.  I was disappointed in the sushi menu.  There were not a lot of special rolls or variety.  Shame on me for going to a hibachi place for sushi and believing all these best sushi in Charlotte reviews.  Get out people!  There is MUCH better sushi in Concord and Charlotte.  I ordered the fantasy roll and the hot twister roll.  The fantasy was simple and fresh. I prefer soy sheet so it was nice to see one on the menu.  The hot twister was ehhh.  I knew better than to order a fried roll as I like cold sushi.  I really could not taste anything in that roll except the batter.  Overall, it was just ok sushi.  If I come again, it will be to try the hibachi."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  Our chef was lacking any kind of personality or energy.  He did not smile, laugh, engage us in light-hearted conversation or make much eye contact.  Our entire table 10+ people, found ourselves turning around to watch and disappointingly wish we got the entertaining show from the chef at a table nearby.  Those customers got what the paid for in an entertaining meal and Japanese steakhouse experience.   The food was just ok.  Again, a slow moving, low energy chef took for ever to prepare the proteins (meats) to accompany now cold veggies and noodles.  Strange indeed."}
{"text":"Loved coming here! Just a little pricy since it reminded me of Tsunami's in Concord (just to compare prices). Besides that great food with plenty to bring home for lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Came here while on the road for work.  Was immediately greeted by friendly hostesses.  I told them I'd just head to the bar since I was dining alone.  The bar tender was prompt and attentive - they even have a few craft beers on draft!  I decided on a couple of sushi rolls.  They came out very quickly and were delicious!  There were a number of larger parties in there sitting around watching their food being made.  Thumbs up from my perspective...if back in the area, I will hit them up again!"}
{"text":"The best trip ever! I will say that this is my fifth or sixth time at the location. Whether it was for lunch or dinner, the food was always good. It was  always a great show. 
I will say the highlight of the evening is that the chef toned down the show of flames becuase my 2yo daughter was frightened. So nice!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time there! Good food, very full filling -and had left overs. Chef was awesome!"}
{"text":"Party of 14 with a birthday  Reservations for 7 o'clock worst service ever from messed up drinks to not Being attentive as a waiter to not serving 2 members of our party's meals at all then we were told by the manger that we should have told the waiter when ordering our food of the food Allergy that the two that was not served in our group please note the waiter was told as well as the person cooking that's why thy never got it it was told by the cook it would be coming from the back and the waiter said to tell the cook  we have eaten at  nakatoes in the past with a totally different outcome , I confronted the manager and was treated like it was all about the money our table spent well over 400.00 to get the service and management of a  bad fast food chain  was  ridiculous and to mess up a birthday party  buyer bewarned"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time. Food was delicious, the waitress did an amazing job and the chef was very entertaining. Great evening!"}
{"text":"We have been fans of Nakato's for a few years. Up until recently I could justify the price for rice and chicken by the show that was put on by the cooks. This has sadly faded with each visit. Our most recent visit last week was more of the same. If you want chicken and rice with no frills for a family of 4 and want to pay $120 , this is your spot. 
We are now looking for another place to have our birthday dinners for our children.
Sorry to see another great place fade due to service taking second place behind profits."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for 5 minutes waiting for a menu to order some food, or a, \"hello be right with you\" but didn't get so much as a smile or a glance. Terrible service, will not return."}
{"text":"We typically have a great time here. The food is good and the chefs are fun. The one thing we typically run into issues with are the servers. They are kind of slow to refill drinks. The prices are reasonable for how much food you get and it's always pretty tasty. Just be careful of going during prime time because the wait can be pretty long."}
{"text":"The sushi is really good and so is the hibachi. This is the best shrimp sauce in town in my opinion (pink sauce, seafood sauce, whatever you call it). Prices aren't bad. Highly recommend for your everyday Japanese fix."}
{"text":"Fun night out with the family and celebrating a belated and early birthday with my bf, daughter & niece.

What a great spot to visit and our chef was extremely funny & professional. I think this is very important because I've heard stories of people not enjoying their chef which completely ruins the experience. My daughters last experience in Florida wasn't the best so happy she got to experience a professional.

Our chef cooked the Steak to a medium specification as requested but shrimp slightly over cooked but overall everything was great. The service & staff very attentive never waited on anything other than the next round of food lol .

If you're looking for a great night out with friends or family with a hint of entertainment check out Nakato you won't be disappointed. Me and my friends will definitely be back in the near near future.


FYI - The calamari is grilled and not fried lol"}
{"text":"I got take out. The sushi was edible but by the smell of it when I first took it out of the box, it was not as fresh as I would like. There is not much of a raw roll selection.
I am used to more creativity in rolls and this place was lacking. I'm new to the area and this is the second place I've tried for sushi so far.
It's in 2nd place out of two. And it's pricey!"}
{"text":"Really awesome dinner! The employees were all very nice! I had the shrimp and chicken combo and it was excellent! It was done very fast and we were stuffed well! I brought my 2 year old and he really enjoyed it. Not for everyone's kid though because the fire can be scary for some kids. 

The drinks were reasonably priced and that is SO refreshing to see anywhere in Charlotte. 

Great Japanese steakhouse! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi.  No wait at sushi bar on a Wednesday night.  $21 combinarion platter with 10 pieces sushi and an 8 piece sushi roll, and another $7 for an 8 piece spicy tuna roll.  

I like to rate how good a sushi place is by how rubbery the octopus is, and for some reason they love to include it in combo platters. .. this was perfect, ie, not a piece of hard rubber.

I will be back."}
{"text":"Love Love Love!!! Me and my moms favorite restaurant since I've been leaving in Charlotte. I grew up eating here at least once a week and I've always loved the staff, chefs, and food! Always fresh, cooked in front of you if you get hibachi, and a great show to go along with it. Prices are very fair and you definitely feel like you get your money's worth here every time. The ambiance is great any time of the day and the food is always amazing! Hibachi for all eating habits and they're very accommodating for your special dietary needs. Including cooking the food to your liking w/ no extra charge. Safe to say this is my spot!"}
{"text":"Sushi tastes okay. Ordered spiderwoman,, good,  dragon, okay,  49, not my thing, and caterpillar, my favorite out of these four. Nice miso soup, seaweed salad and hot tea."}
{"text":"Great service and good food.. had a birthday party here and it was a success!!! Love this place and eat here in the regular"}
{"text":"This place used to be good. Keyword used to be!  The fried rice was over done by garlic and if you love garlic you would understand why I didn't like it cause I love garlic. It was absolutely too much. Nothing else complimented it. Short ribs were horrible we didn't eat it and still was charged for it even though we told our server it wasn't good. Service was fine... But I think their hibachi isn't worth the money. The chefs can hardly entertain!!!  Anyways. Good luck on you're trip."}
{"text":"Steak was good. Chicken was chewy. Service was great. Price not bad. I've had much better for the price."}
{"text":"So I made a reservation for four on the tables you take your shoes off. So we get there with our two girls and my husband and take a seat. They both the waiter and some manager made us move our seats three times to accommodate a larger party. Pushing us all the way to the side where our girls couldn't see the cooking 'show'. Then to top things off the cook looked and acted like he was miserable and the food was salty and not good at all. Waitress didn't bring any drink refills. So definitely won't be going back! What a waste of money, much have rather went to Tokyo Grill which is right by there. They have hibachi and plenty of other food choices. Went there for the show but that and the service was horrible."}
{"text":"A Japanese steak house is supposed to be entertaining. Our cook had no personality to the point of being rude. When asking him a question he answered as though we were wasting his time. Food was just okay I've had better."}
{"text":"Nakato is wonderful. We went here for my wife's birthday and it coming from South Charlotte it was well worth the drive. The entrance has high ceilings and an overall great atmosphere. 

Had the hibachi and it was dinner and a show as the chef was very good at making a delicious dinner but he was very funny as well. The portions were good, the fried rice was great, and my standard steak and shrimp was all I could ask for.

We had a great time and we will be back."}
{"text":"So SO GOOD! My wife was in the mood for Asian Fusion and were in town for meetings so we decided to look some good Asian and here in the middle of what seems kinda hipster/ghetto was Yama Izakaya! There are so many things to choose from on the menu. We decided to order the whole grilled squid, and the tonkostu which is ramen served with Chashu (pork), nori, sesame seeds, scallions, menma (bamboo shoot), seasoned egg and fish cake. It was a creamy broth that was perfectly seasoned. Super good!!! The service was great and we were never without a filled glass. Very cool atmosphere and vibe. Decorated nicely and a great place all around. If we are ever back in Charlotte we will be back."}
{"text":"Found this gem on vacation at Great Wolf Lodge.  Searched around trying I find a Japanese Hibachi not too far from the Great Wolf Lodge and this fit.  Price was kind of high but the food was great.  Along with the normal fried rice you got noodles which I loved.  Will return for sure."}
{"text":"Good food! The energy wasn't all there when cooking! The filet was very good! Overall the restaurant was very clean and friendly. I'm used to high energy cooking by the Chefs in Fredericksburg VA! They interact with the guests a lot. It may have been just an off night though."}
{"text":"I had plans to meet a friend for dinner and this is the restaurant that he picked. Despite living in the University area for almost 5 years now, I had never been to Nakato. 

Nakato offers Teppsn Yaki (hibachi) and Sushi. My friend and I were both in the mood for sushi so we did not sit at a hibachi table. The sushi/non-hibachi section is a decent size. It has a full bar with seating and then probably about 6 table/booths with seating for 4 at each. 

Obviously hibachi is this restaurants main selling point which is always a cause for concern when you order the sushi whether or not it will be any good. I've been to other hibachi places that also offer sushi but it seems more like an after thought and isn't that great. However the items we ordered from the sushi menu were great! 

Off the sushi appetizer menu I got the Hawaiian poke salad with tuna and the tuna carpaccio. I visited Hawaii last May and fell in love with poke. While it is definitely better in Hawaii this salad had a a good flavor. The tuna carpaccio was also delicious.  I also ordered a sushi roll. The rolls here aren't that special or creative - again I think it has to do with the fact that hibachi is its main attraction and the sushi is more of a secondary menu item. My friend ordered  the sashimi Omakase and the sea urchin. He was excited that they actually had the sea urchin. He told me other restaurants that list it on their menus often tell him they do not have it in stock.

The parking lot is a little strange, especially if you get brought in the back. The outside decor is pretty stark and bare for the most part. You might drive right past it. The inside is very nice and clean. While the sushi was nothing special it was fresh and delicious. If you don't want anything fancy or into sashimi and nigiri Nakato is a great option. 

I am glad that I finally found this gem in the University area."}
{"text":"Five stars for being my top hibachi experience within  Charlotte. Talented chefs, attentive staff, clean facilities. Also offers scallops, not something I've seen before but enjoyed as much as from a seafood centric restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Nakato!  They always have the freshest sushi, and I love the variety of special rolls.   I have never had a bad experience here.  The staff are fantastic as well.  This is the place to go if you're in the University area!"}
{"text":"The early bird special is the way to go.. The wife ordered the veggie dinner as well.. Despite earlier post i read it was plenty!! Of food.. The waitress was top notch and the decor is one of the nicest ive observed.. Only reason its not a 5 star is our bill was still 40 for two of us with drinks, even with the early bird.. However, it was flavorful and better than your average hibachi place."}
