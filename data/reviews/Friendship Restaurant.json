{"text":"Best customer service offered to date from a restaurant, while ordering on the phone and placing it through the JustEat website! Katie was extremely helpful and double checked my order, and the prices are amazing! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"I've been eating take out at this restaurant for sometime now. I've had a few customer service issues over the years but overall my experiences here have been great. The food is  above par for the most part.   The diamond in the rough here is the pepper sauce. It is one of a kind. I've literally tried thousands of different pepper sauces and this one is a classic. It's spot on with the balance between heat and flavour and tastes unlike anything else.   Good food, fast delivery, friendly service.   5 stars"}
{"text":"Having not been into the Friendship Restaurant in some time I saw the sign outside for the $8 buffet and I did not have the highest expectations, but Friendship pretty much blew me away. Aside from the broccoli being cooked slightly more than I prefer, everything on the menu was excellent. Any breaded items had excellent quantities of meat inside and the noodles and rice were very nicely flavoured. I would say this is the best deal in the neighbourhood when it comes to lunch specials. Nicely flavoured curry chicken, a well-balanced General Tsao's chicken and many more.   On top of the excellent value for the food, the service was stellar. Although we sat down at a booth with no cutlery, by the time I had selected my items from the buffet, forks, knives and glasses of ice water were already on the table and although I drank a great quantity of water, service was always prompt and polite."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant. I have been coming here for a couple of years now. I have dined in and have picked up food from this restaurant. The food always tastes fresh and is seasoned well. I usually order the spicy lobster special, their spicy chicken wings, spicy shrimp and chicken fried rice. I have tried other things on their menu but those are my favourites. Their food is always on point. The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because a few times I have ordered food to pick up and they have gotten the order wrong and then I ended up having to wait for them to make the food that I actually ordered. I notice that only happened when a lady that doesn't speak english fluently takes my order. So keep that in mind if ordering food to take out.  I still order from here though. I just speak very slowly when giving my order and I ask the person to repeat my order and then I check my order when I pick up."}
{"text":"Didn't see any reviews on this place on yelp so thought I'd add one. Found out about it on restaurantica where it has some decent reviews. Went for Saturday lunch with some mild traditional Canadian-Chinese food (spring rolls, chicken balls, fried rice and noodle) loving family members and were not disappointed. Lots of food for a very reasonable price but flavour was pretty plain and similar across the dishes although between the food allergies (nuts/fish) and spice version of our party, we didn't experience the full palate of the kitchen. Reviews on restaurantica spoke highly of the weekday lunch buffet which is like $7 or something. Our $60 worth of food for a party of five will yield a full second meal in leftovers.   During our visit there was a lively and loud domino game going on in the small front bar area along with a couple other guys enjoying a few cold beverages. The stack of beer empties by the washroom indicates that this place may get a bit more interesting at times than your average Asian strip plaza restaurant.   The fresh food and fast, friendly service bods well for taking a more adventurous dive into the menu which features some spicy Asian options as well as Indian and Caribbean variations as well. If you do visit, please post so when I am back in the area I can order at least one adventurous dish while my family noshes on their chicken balls and fried rice. I think it has potential."}
{"text":"I've been trying to find a Canadian-Asian restaurant that does delivery in my area. I gave this place a try tonight. We ordered... Chicken spring rolls  General Tao chicken  Sweet & Sour Chicken  Spare ribs  Mixed Caribbean fried rice. The rice was amazing!! A spicy kick. Will order again. I definitely want to try their lunch buffet.  Total for our order $40. It was for 2 people but we certainly will get 2 more meals out of it. Maybe more."}
{"text":"Wanted to try out a new restaurant and we figured that \"friendship restaurant\" was a good choice. However when we did order our experience was very difficult and frustrating. The meal was over priced with over 10 dollars of the total, not for food but for tax, delivery charge, and an included tip. When the food came an hour later the employee asked for additional tips which we refused to pay. Our barely fresh food was paired with no utensils or napkins. Overall this restaurant is named \"friendship\" however this was absolutely not \"friendship\"  and  I would not come again because of this awful service."}
{"text":"Good food and fair prices. I've ordered here over a dozen times and I don't remember a bad experience with meals. Manchurian chicken or fish it's especially good"}
{"text":"Great tasting buffet for a price of a meal in a food court. $10.95 gets you unlimited access to caribean chicken curry, jerk chicken/pork, chow mein, dry spice chilli chicken, sweet n sour pork, spring rolls and chicken balls, mixed veggies, veggie rice, chicken wings, crispy fried chicken, soup, and roti.  Where else can you go wrong? The food is much tastier than your usual chinese buffet, and the kicker.. literally.. the pepper sauce tableside thats comparable to home made pepper sauces.   Oh on top of that, you can get a lobster fresh cooked for $12.97 with the sauce of your choice, black pepper sauce, dry crispy, or ginger and onion...  Setting isnt the fanciest, but who cares for the price and the food.. serious scarborough gem right here."}
{"text":"The staff are friendly but the food is terrible... the chicken and beef are all over battered.  They give you a lot of food but the quality is so bad. I'd think twice before thinking about ordering here again.  I wish they could hire some new cooks or change there ingredients because its so cloae to my house. I had to give a one star because I felt sick after eating the food...."}
