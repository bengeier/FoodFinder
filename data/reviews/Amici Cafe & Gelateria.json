{"text":"This fantastic little cafe is located right in the heart of Port Credit and has the most incredible gelato I've had. The flavors are amazing, my personal favorite is the green apple. Very friendly family-owned business. The drink selection is quite nice too and the caramel latte is to die for. I've been here many times and once stayed to watch the entire Italy vs England Euro Cup match with some very enthusiastic patrons. Cannot recommend enough!"}
{"text":"This cafe has changed ownership and is called Port 1, it is terrible. They've changed all the flavours and doesn't taste as good as it used to. 

They have taken half the flavours away and replaced it with dufflet pastries. 

I'm not sure of the yelp protocol, but this is no longer the same name."}
{"text":"Favourite sweet stop in Port Credit!  I've been coming here since they first opened, not super often, but often enough to taste quite a few of their flavours like:  Mixed Berry, Coconut (love!), Mango (LOVE!), Salted Peanut (tastes like peanut butter), Cappuccino, etc.

I love this place 'cause they make their own gelato.  So it's not like Baskin Robbins or Scoops in that you don't exactly know what you're getting, ingredient-wise!  You can taste the natural ingredients and it's not chalk-full of food colouring.

A small, which is sufficient enough for me, is $4.15, after taxes and you can get 2 flavours!  Not too heavy, or sugary sweet, but just right.

I have yet to try a caffeinated beverage here 'cause I get too distracted by their flavours.  So maybe next time, I'll skip Starbucks!"}
{"text":"I lived in Italy for 5 weeks eating gelato atleast once a day. This is not gelato. The arancia flavour tastes like powdered flavour in iced milk, and the tiramisu flavour tasted like nothin but iced milk. Too creamy to be gelato, or maybe powdery, I can't really tell the difference. The ambiance of the place an the way the gelato is presented is wonderful! But I'm not paying 4.50 for a small cup for the ambiance. I'm paying for powdery Icecream."}
{"text":"Salted Peanut Butter.. so creamy... so rich.. I think this is my favourite flavour aside from Hazelnut.

Amici Cafe & Gelato's friendly staff agreed with me on this too. 

Though during the depth of winter, the gelato Amici offers might be a little limited but quite sufficient to satisfy even picky eater like me!

The interior is bright and cheerful, feel like I am in a sun room. Nice and warm sunshine from the huge floor to ceiling windows.........

I can't wait till summer......................"}
