{"text":"Love it! Quality food at expected price. The bread is great! Sometimes you have to ask for it though  Service is outstanding"}
{"text":"Pretty good place for a hotel restaurant. The food was prepared well and they had an excellent selection of craft beers on tap. The waitress was new but very outgoing and knowledgable - she was clearly well trained. There is no discernible theme to the place and this was made obvious by the curious choice of music which was some sort of emo genre played way too loud. It was out of character for a dinner restaurant and was terribly distracting. But, if you are staying at the Doubletree and are looking for a decent meal, a good beer and friendly and staff, this place fits the bill. Just bring some earphones!"}
{"text":"Awful service. Awful experience. After a 40 minute wait for the food (slow service), I received my salmon - two times returned because it was raw in the center (note - I love sushi but this was wet raw). After returned again raw, told server didn't want it - he offered to remove from the bill - did not offer any other options - didn't even offer to provide any other concessions. Very disappointed. By the way - I went to the Penguins hockey game and had great sushi at the stadium (much better food than this restaurant). I do not recommend!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast and lunch here while staying at the doubletree. The breakfast buffet was good with a nice selection of bacon, sausage, eggs, fruit, etc. and there was also a chef preparing eggs and omelets to order. A little pricey for breakfast, but the food and service was good despite being very busy.  Lunch was another story. I was eating alone and ordered a burger and a salad. There were only 2 or 3 other tables occupied at the time (11:45 am), however, my food did not arrive for 28 minutes! The burger was overlooked and tasted mediocre at best. The salad was pretty good and the wait staff was very polite, but overall the experience left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Drove up to my hometown over Labor Day weekend and stayed at the DoubleTree in downtown as it is a convenient location and close to everything we wanted to see while in town.  On Saturday after checking in we planned on heading directly to Market Square but got trapped in the hotel for a few hours as heavy thunderstorms hit the area.  No worries, we decided to go have some beers at the Bigelow Grille hotel bar and grab some bar food while we waiting for better weather.  First off no complaints on the food.  It was actually really good and reasonably priced.  We shared a cheese & fruit tray, bowl of wonderful tomato bisque and the mac and cheese skillet.  The problem we had was with our server (Holly).  We commented on what a great selection of music was being played.  She explained it was Pandora radio and how they go back and forth on how to select what is played depending on who's on duty.  We complimented her on the food, talked about the weather and she seemed really nice.  Next thing we hear is her talking to her co workers (and manager) making fun of us within earshot.  We weren't being weird, we were not drunk and were just hanging out at a small table by the bar enjoying ourselves.  After paying our (with tip) $88 tab the least you could have done was waited till we left to talk behind our backs.  I'm not sure what we did to her but I just want to let whoever reads this know, it really hurt my wife's feelings and put a damper on our evening when we did get out on the town..."}
{"text":"This place is decent if you are in the area.  We ate here before a Penguins game and it satisfied our needs.  The appetizer with the tomato chutney and the bread was very delicious.   I recommend this appetizer if you do go there."}
{"text":"it's pretty bad when the manager seats you and you still don't get a server! sat at our table for at least 10 minutes and no one even came near us. awful service! they weren't even that busy..."}
{"text":"After years of holding a monthly business meeting at another downtown restaurant, we opted for better service and better food (plus free parking) at the Bigelow Grille.  Friendly, efficient service and good food."}
{"text":"I visited Bigelow Grill while staying the Doubletree. Four friends and I dined at the restaurant. My friend and I ordered the macaroni and cheese. Overall this was a very simple, yet tasty dish. The price was a little on the higher side for mac and cheese. Another friend ordered the pizza and she was happy with the product. Another friend ordered the grilled cheese. It was literally a block of cheese that was flambayed. The description on the menu did not properly describe the product. Overall food was good but prices could be a deterrent. We did not try any of the pricier items."}
{"text":"I'm writing to help bump up the rating for this restaurant. Stayed in the hotel and was hesitant to try because of some of the reviews here, but like someone else wrote, was just too tired to walk anywhere else. I had the rainbow trout with cous cous, kale and cherry tomatoes and it was delicious.  For breakfast had a simple two eggs over easy with rye toast and potatoes and fruit - also very good.  My service was friendly and timely  for both meals.   Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Just spent three nights at the Doubletree Hotel in Pittsburgh, where the Bigelow Grill is housed. We had dinner and breakfast there, and that was more than enough to send us out to find other dining establishments.   The Appetizers at our Group's Table (providing the only truly tasty items in our experience with the menu):  Roasted Brussel Sprouts - simple, tasty, and cooked to perfection; Spicy Tomato Bisque - as advertised, spicy and a good soup; Winter Squash - sweet, cooked well, and a satisfying level of sweet to complement the natural sweet of the squash; \"Artisan Cheese Plate\" - consisting of exactly three pieces of uninspiring cheese, four pieces of toasted bread, a bit of jam, and a fresh berry or two (this one was particularly disappointing at its $11 price)  Next, our Entre Selections (which left MUCH to be desired):  Duck - uninspired and strange flavor and texture combinations with a sweet rice and sweet paste beneath an unseasoned, undercooked duck; \"Gourmet\" Macaroni & Cheese with \"smoked chicken\" - elbow macaroni noodles with a small amount of, again unseasoned, cream, a hint of non-de script cheese, and a few chunks of chicken, the predominant impression being \"dry\"; Spanish Canelones - flavorless and dry as well; Lemon Risotto - the only bright spot in the entre selection tried at our table  Finally, our breakfast attempt the following morning: all I can say about the buffet is, Just Don't. Everything else off the menu was neither inspiring, nor awful...with the exception of the congealed lump of raisins that was passed off as \"craisins\" served with the mushy oatmeal.  Because there are not a lot of dining options within a few blocks of the Doubletree on the weekends, our group really wanted to like the Bigelow Grille. They get two stars for the servers, who were friendly and helpful. However, the quality of the menu hovers between uninspiring, just bland, and awful.  NOT recommended."}
{"text":"The food was priced pretty normal for a hotel restaurant. I made the assumption that tortellini plate would have more food to it. The service was definitely good.  I had a raspberry Moscow Mule which was one of the better variants of a ginger beer drink I've had. I had tortellini with pork belly. I assumed there would be more food. I wasn't full after eating it, but it was very good. The veggies and nuts really gave it a different taste. It was good overall."}
{"text":"Visited the place because it was located in the hotel I stayed for my area visit. It took about 10 minutes to be seated. Since I came down later morning not sure why it took so long. Only one party, literally one person, in front of me and a small group of 2 or 3 as I recall. Since I was trying to save some time I had the buffet. Choices were scramble eggs, with or without cheese, home fries, bacon, sausage links, oatmeal, various breads, some cold cereals and a little bit of fresh fruit. Eggs tasted different than my home area as well as the potatoes. The waitress was quick and friendly. Prices were fair. They are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Open early to late. They also have a bar area which I didn't visit. Overall its nice and clean with comfortable and tasteful decoration design."}
{"text":"Overpriced breakfast buffet at 16$. I only went for breakfast so my review is a little scarce. Not much else to say - typical hotel buffet.. eggs, bacon, sausage, french toast, pancakes, oatmeal, yogurt, omelette station, fruit."}
{"text":"With the raining beating down outside we decided to just grab a bite here since we were staying at the Double Tree hotel attached.  We ordered a salad and a sandwich with the perogies. Both were fresh, delicious and elegantly presented. (Check the pictures out).  They also started us off with some bread and 'tomato, oil' concoction for dipping. Yum!  The waitress, hostess and manager were all extremely friendly, polite, and willing to accommodate even asking if I'd like to make any substitutions to the salad without being prompted to do so. Our waitress could probably have used a little polishing. \"Are you done with the tomato stuff?\" or \"The Bean Fritters are fritters with beans in them\". But now I'm just being picky, she really was a great waitress overall.  I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"This restaurant didn't have the best reviews, so I was unsure.  Fortunately, I was blown away with the customer service by the restaurant manager.  He understood my dilemma and picked up real fast that I was a discerning customer.  First, I checked in and to my surprise Yelp was offering a free tin of cookies!  The morning restaurant staff was not aware of \"tins of cookies\", but after I insisted that Yelp was offering a \"tin of cookies\", at check in, she checked and \"yep\", it was available for private events.  I guess I was going to be a private one-woman event!  I was told they would be waiting for me at the front desk when I came back from my conference. They were and they were warm and so delicious...I brought the beautiful tin and cookies home with me.  There were a ton of cookies in the tin - impressive!  The food: later I had room service and the manager helped me to decide.  I had a lovely gnocchi with oxtail and kale and it was delightful.  There was a side of shaved parmesan reggiano and it was divine.  I am so glad that he helped me pick that meal, although there seemed to be a few other really good choices.  The manager shared with me that they are a farm to table restaurant, and that their chicken and meat comes directly from this source.  The breakfast was great (the buffet) one day they served a delicious beef hash, and the beef was so soft and flavorful.  That was from the Farm to Table provider and was a one-day thing.  I looked for that HASH the next morning, but nope,  I was a little bummed, but, I needed no more calories.  Overall, I would definitely not skip the restaurant if you are staying in the Doubletree in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I'm torn, the bar has a good atmosphere and they had all the hockey games on. I would say the service was pretty good too, but the food was not that good at all. I tried the meatballs and a salad and it was nothing great. The next night I tried the flatbread. It tasted like it was frozen and microwaved. The hotel is in a high traffic area and hard to get to. Its also valet parking. This place is good to just grab a drink, but I wouldn't recommend the food menu."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars, I would. The staff is fantastic, but omg, do everyone a favor and remove the pizza from the menu. Clearly, this place has noooo idea on how to make pizza. Fake meatballs, greasy and doughy base....just all around terrible!"}
{"text":"Terrible service bartender kept leaving food is overpriced for quality and portion size . Bartender kept leaving for extended amounts of time, and getting seated takes way to long just plain rediculous especially when you can see wait staff laughing and joking around in kitchen... horrible experience!!"}
{"text":"I really really like this place before a Pens game.  It's a cool, clean, moderately priced restaurant .... the service is always very spot on, and the beer selection is never disappointing.  My only complaint is that the menu is sometimes too ..... I dunno ... hip?  Elegant?  I really don't know how to describe it.  If you're a simple person with simple tastes, it will take a little bit to get through the menu.  The special last night was brisket tacos which were remarkable ..... and their fries are awesome .... ok ... I just talked myself into giving them a 5."}
{"text":"I eat at the Grille on a weekly basis since it is where our Pittsburgh Kiwanis Club meets.  The staff at the BG is extremely nice and accommodating, whenever their schedule allows we get the table in the nook area where we can have our meeting while eating and not disturbing the rest of the restaurant which to a certain degree gives the meeting a higher degree of business atmosphere.  Having tried several of their dishes I can say that their most recent menu revisions address a lot of the concerns I have read in past reviews.  Portion sizes are very generous (the exception being their seafood offerings) and their quality of cooking is quite good.  In the last couple of months I have tried:    - Bigelow Burger    - Jumbo Sandwhich    - Artesan Grilled Cheese with Tomato Soup    - Crunchy Tilapia Tacos    - Chicken Panini     - Several Desserts  All of the dishes above met or exceeded my expectations.  The pricing fluctuates from the affordable (Grilled Cheese & Soup) to the extravagant (seafood dishes).  Be advised that some of their deserts infuse a lot of flavors that to the inexperienced palate will come as a shock.  Granted with the aforementioned revisions they've also toned down the infusions theme in the desserts.  I can certainly see myself taking friends to the BG, and definitely continuing our meetings as long as their staff and management will have us."}
{"text":"Requested the Mac and cheese vegetarian and got a meat plate.  Then not checked on for 10 minutes and then had to wait for a new order.  F this place.  If given the choice of any other restaurant.  You should choose another place.  I waited almost an hour for some macaroni and cheese.  I could have drove home and made some kraft in a box for how long this isht took."}
{"text":"I read the Yelp reviews and saw that this place had two stars.  Having avoided Yelp two star review restaurants, I told myself to keep an open mind as the restaurant held themselves out as \"local organic kitchen and bar\" on the top of both their menu and website.    When a restaurant uses the words \"organic\" and  \"local\" in their title, this usually implies that the restaurant is using a farm to table concept. Not at this establishment!  The best that I can gather is that this restaurant used the terms very literally in using the word \"local\" to imply \"nearby to a hotel\" and \"organic\" to imply \"not made out of inorganic material such as steel\".    I did not see many organic items and the menu did not list the local source of ingredients.    The food quality was basic and somewhat overpriced.  $15 for a BLT made from \"pork belly\". The bun tasted like something one can get in a 6 pack from the grocery store for $2.99. The $15 pizza with \"rooftop herbs\" were actually just microgreens.  Seemed small for the price.    We were he only ones in the restaurant at 6pm which is always a telling sign that the locals know that this is not the place to be.    Draft beer list lacked creativity and had 6 IPAs and one blonde.  That's it.  Very limited selection.    If you respect yourself as a foodie or just someone who likes food, stay away from this restaurant.  I should have listened better to the negative Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"Who'd've thought a hard-to-find place tucked beneath a hotel would be the place to grab some really good chow?  Bigelow Grille prides itself on being a local and organic kitchen and bar, and I have to say, they know their stuff when it comes to their food. Their presentation and set-up, though...it leaves room for improvement.  Before getting to the food menu I naturally looked over a wine menu and was disappointed by my limited options. If you only order a glass rather than a bottle, you can only pick from about 5 options instead of 20 or so. Sadly the drink I really wanted was only available as a bottle...also, I dealt with a very weird reaction when I got carded; the waitress said, \"Oh my gosh, you're a baby!\" Is this normal etiquette when talking to a young adult woman who works full time and has been out of school for a while? It wasn't outright offensive but it was very offputting. What was I supposed to say to that?  Well, fortunately the meal itself was actually pretty stupendous and made up for everything. The tomato bisque had a really good kick to it that even I, a hater of spicey foods, really enjoyed. The lamb burger I ordered was to die for - cooked perfectly, served with a side of greens and dressing, all in the perfect portions. Forget dessert - I'd come back just to try another burger or their gnocchi!  It's definitely been a long time since I ate such a fresh meal that left me satisfied, and I truly want to come back and enjoy another one. Now if only the weather wasn't getting colder...sadly, we must add another complaint regarding the place's layout: the restaurant has a long row of unlocked sliding doors right next to the dining tables. I guess if those doors don't lock during the winter, I'll have to postpone my next visit to the land of local organic goodness for the summer. The food may be good, but it's not good enough to shiver over!"}
{"text":"Great visit to the Bigelow Grille!  Great pizza, delicious salad and outstanding Savignon Blanc.  Everyone should try this restaurant!  Chocolate ice cream to finish the evening hits the spot!  What more can I say!?!? Come on in and enjoy an evening here at the Bigelow Grille!"}
{"text":"I had been really excited to try this restaurant because the menu looked so good, but I was quite disappointed. I went there for dinner on the 4th of July with my husband and mother-in-law. The food was pretty mediocre. The decor seemed cheap (also keep in mind that it's located in a hotel). Our server was rushing us the whole time, serving our dinner while we were still eating our appetizers, asking if we wanted dessert menus when we were still eating our entrees... She was very nice, but in too much of a hurry, and she also forgot the beer my husband ordered. Would not go back here."}
{"text":"Awful service. Poor management. Food was decent but not worth the experience of dining there."}
{"text":"In town for the week on business and ALWAYS stay at Doubletree Downtown! Had dinner in the restaurant and it was one of the best ever! Chicken and waffle appetizer and pork tenderloin for dinner! Both were absolutely amazing! And Holly was awesome!"}
{"text":"I never knew anybody can make a burger as bad as this place does. No flavor and it was clearly burned. Will never go back there to eat for sure."}
{"text":"I travel a LOT, and I can probably count the number of amazing hotel restaurants I have found on one hand. This place just bumped someone off the list. WOW.  This is a totally upscale version of Pittsburgh classic fare. Don't be misled by all of the negative complaints - they sound like nice, blue collar folk. But dinner here is definitely not blue collar. For one, the menu is the way it's supposed to be - chosen by the chef based on what is in season and at the peak of flavor. Everything is local, and to a foodie, that is a beacon of quality. And the creativity the chef uses in building out the menu is worthy of the Food Network.  I had some spicy tomato bisque tonight that was just out of this world. Then I went with the chef's own sausage and cheese creation. Classic for Pittsburgh, right? Except the quality was WAY above expectations and just filled my palate with delicious complexity. I am already planning on coming back tomorrow night.  If you want a simpler, cheaper meal - head over to the nearby Primanti's. If you want to savor every bite and challenge what you think you already know about food, get to the Bigelow Grille now. It's that good."}
{"text":"Slow and expensive for breakfast.  My frittata was supposed to have feta, and it did, but just barely.  I suppose they are treating the hotel customers as a captive audience."}
{"text":"Staff is always so friendly here.  Love the fact that the menu items are local and fresh.  It makes the food taste so much better!  If you stay in the DoubleTree, you can get room service for the Bigelow Grille.  Always nice to travel and know even the room service is impeccable.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for six friends at the Bigelow Grill prior to a concert at PPG Arena.  The reservation was for 6 pm.  The concert started at 8 pm.   We were greeted when we arrived, on time, and seated in a separate room.  It was as if we were put in a separate restaurant.  We were neglected.  It took the waitress 10-15 minutes to even acknowledge us.   She took both our drink and food orders together.  We waited.  Finally five dinners arrived.  She forgot the sixth dinner.  It arrived much later, after everyone else was done eating.  To the Grille's credit, they comped that meal. We asked for more water; it never came.   We waited for our checks then waited for them to be collected.  Finally we chased her down to pay.   On top of all this the food was just okay."}
{"text":"I cannot really even give this restaurant 1 star. It was absolutely horrible. The service, the food, just everything was horrible. We did not get our appetizer until we hunted down our server 30 minutes after we ordered. Our bread basket came at the end of the meal. We got our meal 45 minutes after ordering, only after again hunting down our server and asking for our check. We should have continued out the door, but we were hungry. The food was slimy and cold and just awful. Nothing about this dining experience was acceptable."}
{"text":"Annoying place.  Music is way too loud. Meals are heavy and the food is not very good.  Green beans have an odd taste and are simultaneously oily and not cooked.   They have an elk burger on the menu so I asked if I could taste elk.  Just a sample.  But the chef would only let me \"buy\"a small piece of the patty.  I settled on ribeye and asked the waitress what medium rare meant at this restaurant but she didn't know how to describe it.  She is really nice.  I described it as cooked, but at the very center, it's just short or raw.  What I got was a browned raw steak.  They described the potatoes as Rosemary fries. What they were was potato wedges not fries in any way.  They seemed baked, not fried.  This meal was a very expensive disaster and I now have to find a place to eat tomorrow.  The creme brûlée is ok, but not outstanding like it was at House in SF."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. It's a bit noisy. But my food was great. I had the lamb chops with cannolli beans and roasted asparagus, carrots,  and spring onions.  I understand from my waitwr that this was the first day this item was on the menu; it's excellent.  I also had a dry cabernet savignon that paired very well. My friend had a fried chicken sandwich with French fries. She said both tasted good."}
{"text":"I'm gonna go along with what Ryan has to say about this place.  I'm also wary of hotel restaurants because they vary so greatly in quality and they tend to be a little pricey.  Besides, a hotel bar-and-grill is one of the least likely places you'd expect a sister-and-brother to dine at.    My brother Paul and I ended up eating dinner here last night before going over to the Civic* Arena for the Roger Daltry/Eric Clapton concert.  Our original plan had been to meet at Chinatown Inn.  Indeed, I had my heart and palate set on good Chinese food.  But with the winter weather we decided to eat at a place a little closer to the Arena.  The food here wasn't bad, but holy macaroni!  $12.00 for my cheeseburger?  $15.00 for my brother's steak sandwich?  Good thing we ordered off the bar menu, 'cos we weren't planning on spending $35.00 per person for dinner.  We're not cheap or anything, but niether one of us budgeted close to $90.00 for the two of us after tax and tip!    But it's alright in a pinch and I guess they cater to travel-weary hotel guests.  *Yes I still call it the Civic Arena."}
{"text":"Bigelow Grille's staff was very warm and friendly.  The food was delightful and surpassed my expectation.  My favorite parts of the meal were the starting bread with this amazing chutney dip followed with spicy tomato bisque.  It was a very well balanced and hit the spot!  Their brewed iced tea was also refreshing; especially compared to most brewed teas in the area.  I will most certainly try again in the near future."}
{"text":"Great location. They validated my parking at the DoubleTree parking garage! Great food and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Food is consistently good at this restaurant - lunch or dinner... as well as the service - which is very attentive and friendly. One of my favorites.  It also seems to be very popular for pre-game dinners among Pittsburgh Penguins fans due to close proximity to Mellon Arena"}
{"text":"We were here for brunch and they had a good buffet with a hidden omelete station. The food was good and we were able to get our mimosa & bloody mary to start our brunch off right."}
{"text":"Took forever to get a cup of coffee. Got the breakfast buffet which was only $15, a good deal considering the item's price when ordered a la carte. The sausage was gross. The man at the omelet station made me a spinach and mushroom egg white omelet, which was very good. They have an assortment of FRESH fruit, which is nice...everything else is EH...ok."}
{"text":"Good menu, decent prices, very good service. Actually I like the menu a lot, creative dishes - I specially like the scallops. Every dish was a happy surprise. Unfortunately, the ambience and setting leave something to be desired.  I ate here for 4 breakfasts and 4 dinners, and in all cases the music was too loud, inappropriate, and just generally annoying. The booth I sat in 2 evenings  had a loose seat, and the little cacti decorating the tables were dead or dying in about half the tables I saw.  Coffee, food, drinks, and service were all far better than expected."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here once with my husband. The menu includes items such as calamari, pizza, salads, ratatouille, macaroni and cheese, linguine, burgers and other sandwiches, scallops, chicken, and steak. The waitress was nice and brought out our food without long waits, but she accidentally poured a lot of water on my husband's entree when she was doing drink refills. She apologized and offered to bring him out a new plate of food, but he did not want to wait for the food to be cooked, so he just tilted the plate so that the water would fall off. As for the taste of the food, we enjoyed the appetizers and entrees but were not wowed."}
{"text":"Ok, staying at the Doubletree which is a nice hotel I thought maybe the breakfast would be alright.  It was not a good experience.  Getting there a bit after 10am, we were asked if we wanted the buffet.  Now I'm not a big fan of buffets, since everyone is touching the utensils and it's kind of gross, but the added fact that we would likely be some of the last people in for it made methink better of that option very quickly.  As we were seated the waitress asked if we wanted the buffet.  Again no.  She brings my coffee, no milk.  I ask for milk and she says \"1 sec\".  Well 5 minutes later I ask again.  5 minutes after that I finally have milk.  I got an omelet for breakfast.  It was so greasy, that it stayed with me all day.  It was just a bad, bad awful experience."}
{"text":"Get the scallops. Seriously.  The caramelized fennel risotto accompanying genuinely juicy scallops was delicious.  I just wanted to keep eating. The bartender paired it with a tasty beer, and I had an excellent meal tonight. Pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Meh. Had the room service from the Grille and it was OK. Not good, not bad, just ok.   We got to the area a little after 8pm so most things in the area were closed. We went to sit in the restaurant but we thought it would be best for us (and the rest of the world) if we took our infant back to our room and have snacks dropped off.   I had a pretty skimpy cob salad (had you gone a little heavier on the avocado, this would be a four star review...) and Todd had the burger.   Guess what? Order a medium, you'll get a medium-well (but more like well done) burger.  It was decent in our pinch but I'm not trying to go there again- gratuity was added and it was a little 'spensive.   Meh."}
{"text":"I found this place to be a tad over priced for the food you get. I ordered the goat cheese, tomatoe, and spinach fritatta egg whites. It was a good portion but I felt there was not enough cheese or salt or other flavor enhancers.  The wheat toast was very good, came buttered with jam. Highlight of the meal for me."}
{"text":"The food is ok. Not worth the price. Portions are very small. Did not feel like I got my money's worth. Service was friendly but slow."}
{"text":"Don't have much \"yum\" to add here.  Because it is in my hotel, and it is blustering cold outside and i am in a part of town that would require quite a hike to get to the action, i opted for dinner here.  Sadness.  Empty on a Friday night, sat at bar, which had a mildew odor.  What the heck the hotel is dated, and the bar was quite dark, give it a shot.  Not a bad offering of beers on tap so that is my thumbs up.  ordered a local Witte beer and it was good!  Downhill from here - spicy tomato bisque with the parm cheese out of the green can.  (no excuse for this, none).  It was super temperature hot and after i removed this \"cheese\" from the soup, it was ok, but not great. Next - the heirloom beet salad.  I was confused by what was in the salad and asked to see the menu again and had to read it a few times and i concur that what was in the salad was not what was on the menu.  The beets were good but the rest of this was awful. Based on the description - what must have been \"almond sesame crumble\" was stale and hard and too hard to even eat.  And no where in the description was spinach but there it was on my plate. The up side is that i was able to grab my beer and take it to my room, and walk next door to the adjoining 7-11 for a pack of hostess ding-dongs.  Yep.  i did it."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars,  The restaurant sits staunchly between Meh and Allright, Okay, not Terrible.  I should write the new Yelp ranking guidelines.  So, I've had the, um, pleasure of having about 3 meals here due to my long-term residence at the Double Tree Hotel.  Now, don't go stalking me in the lobby.  If you want to say HI, I'll be in the bar.  I digress.  The food is simply OK.  My steak in the steak salad wasn't a great juicy quality; not sure of the cut.  Pasta thingie I had was boring and flavorless.  Gorgonzola flatbread pizza? Was a Boboli!!  Bar closes at 12ish, which was discovered post-Pens game and pre-somebarsomewhereinpittswheretheycondonesmokingandIranintoallthehotelstaff(say that quickly 10 times).  There is this one bartender who is s.l.o.w. and I am not going to detail his slowness any further.  The wine list is bah-ring and spen-die. Imma drink in my room from now on."}
{"text":"The wife and I opted for the breakfast buffet for $16 dollars a piece. There was an omelet bar in addition to the usual breakfast buffet of eggs, bacon, pancakes, sausage, potatoes, French toast and fruits. The problem was in the half hour we were there, there was no chef at the omelet bar. We wondered if it was self serve omelets. I went to the buffet twice and in that time, no chef. I stood there at the omelet station for a while before my first trip to the buffet and nothing. No staff to tel me \"it will be one minute, I'll send him out\". As I'm paying the check, low and behold, the chef shows up. Very poor experience!"}
{"text":"When we are in Pittsburgh we usually stay at the DoubleTree where the restaurant  is located. We enjoy the atmosphere of the dining room and the adjacent bar. We have never had a meal that did not exceed our expectation."}
{"text":"I was happy to find this restaurant in my hotel.  It was late and I didn't want to venture out.  The bar had more people than I expected for a Monday night.  I ordered the gnocchi, which I believe was misspelled on the menu (\"gnocci\").  I planned on pointing this out to the waitress until I heard the way she pronounced gnocchi (\"knock-y\").  (I wonder if she told people she worked at \"Bigelow Grill-e.\")  Somehow this made my dining experience seem a little less upscale.  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with the ambiance - aside from the thick cigarette smoke at the bar.    This sentence had me scratching my head for a while, \"Bigelow is serving innovative and imaginative interpretations of ethnic Pittsburgh classics.\"  Maybe some Pittsburghers will fill me in sometime."}
{"text":"I only stopped in for breakfast over my 2 day stay. Table service was ok, but the hostess was extremely rude and you could tell that she does not like her job or the people she has to deal with. The guy running the omelet station might not be the absolute best at it, but he was friendly and even came around to ask how everything was. Very conversational. Buffet or menu options available."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a quick bite.  Good food! Good Service! Really good music playing! Recommend the Tater Tots!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place hasn't improved for dinner.  I don't  understand why management doesn't redo this restaurant.  Given the number of people that stay in the hotel, this place is usually empty at night except when there is a Penguins game.  I'm sure they are excited that the strike is over.    The Breakfast buffet is very good during the week; omelette station or eggs anyway you like it.  Nancy is a great server!  They have high turnover among the other servers; and service is usually lacking if you don't get Nancy."}
{"text":"I am staying at the DoubleTree now, but a few months ago had read about the Bigelow Grille.  I like to eat at restaurants that prioritize local fare.  I flew into Pittsburgh and got to the hotel after 8pm.  The restaurant is open until 11pm.  I was excited to put my stuff away and come down.  It was not crowded at all.  I should have sat at the bar, but was swayed into a booth, by myself.    I don't mind eating by myself, but when my server is more interested in the family with several young, audible children, instead of me, I get a little annoyed.  They start with bread and this tomato-ish dip (which was delicious).  I ordered the roasted cauliflower, which was also delicious.  I asked the server which was better - the fish and chips, or the burger.  She suggested the fish and chips.  I went with it, but wondered if it really took 20 minutes after getting my cauliflower to receive my entre.    It was heavily breaded and the batter greasy.  I could scoop the fish out of the middle.  I do prefer my fish to be lightly breaded and easily eaten.  I left all the breading in my bowl.  The fish was also placed on top of potato wedges - which the server really raved about - but they were also greasy from the fish.  I didn't finish that.  Still hungry, I would have ordered dessert, however, I was made to wait another 20 minutes after obviously finishing my meal before I could get my check.  And then made to wait again.    So, 2 stars for mediocre fish and chips and bad service.  (however, they do use locally sourced food, so I'm a little torn about leaving it at 2)"}
{"text":"Located on the lobby floor of the Double Tree Hotel, Bigelow Grille is pretty much open all day. I had the fortune of enjoying all of my breakfasts for free with a coupon voucher given to my group as a compliment. The buffet is full. Fresh, and yes I mean fresh cut fruits and all in separate bins which allows for the enjoyment of either one or all of them. The eggs are carton type and are served with or without cheese. There is an array of cereals to choose from and milks. On the mornings that I had breakfast here they had an omelette bar with a lurky looking individual cooking them. Well.... The omelette that I have had have all come out as a neat pile of scrambled eggs and whatever I chose to have with them. The seating and lighting are perfectly quaint. Overall...... A nice experience."}
{"text":"Due to schedule and bad weather I have had three dinners and a breakfast here over the last two weeks. If it wasn't for the captive audience at the hotel I don't think they would stay in business. The quality of the dinners has ranged from just okay to bad.  For some reason the host always wants to seat me at the very first table in the door even when the place is half empty. They market themselves as a local organic kitchen and bar but they fail to meet my expectations and I don't expect much from hotel restaurants.First meal chicken was dry salad was okay but swimming in dressing, next meal butter lettuce salad was decent, meatballs were good but the polenta was runny, tonight the chicken sandwich was tasteless except for the grease and the gnocchi tasted okay but was tough.  Service is not up to par for a nice restaurant more on par with bad fast casual, the staff was pleasant but could use some training on how to set tables and serve meals."}
{"text":"Awesome grilled chicken sandwich. Mixed drinks were strong and have normal priced drafts/bottles. Very unexpected for a hotel restaurant !"}
{"text":"This is the second time that we ate here (see my prior review), this time before the Monday night Steeler game. I thought it would be jammed, but only a few tables were occupied. The menu has changed. We had light fare, soup, salad, etc. I can say it was good, although the grilled cheese was just that: a hunk of gouda, grilled with crostini. Good but a bit disconcerting when you were expecting a sandwich. I had the bolognese with pappardelle and it was very good. Would I go here if I wasn't staying at the hotel and this wasn't a convenient, easy place to eat on a cold, rainy, windy evening? No. I think they are trying too hard to make this something that it can't be. It feels pretentious. They'll never attract people from outside the hotel to this restaurant given the location. What the hotel needs is a good bar that serves good bar food and downhome Pittsburgh basics. How about some perogies and keilbasa? I think they'd pack the place."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for breakfast that came with our stay at the Doubletree hotel. Service was lacking, we had to ask for water and plates for the buffet. The buffet was also 50% empty and there was still an hour left to breakfast. Made to order omelets were tasty though!"}
{"text":"I ordered room service from the Bigelow Grille since I am staying at the Double Tree. I was pretty disappointed. I ordered the spicy tomato soup, the Bigelow Burger, and a side salad. The only reason it gets two stars is for how good the spicy tomato soup was. I'd rather have a large bowl of that than order the burger. The burger was below average - no toppings other than cheese and a slice of tomato.  I ordered the burger medium rare and I received a well done burger. It was pretty thin and not juicy.  My side salad was missing the dressing I ordered.  Needless to say, I'll be going elsewhere for my dinners."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and some fun specials! I stay at the hotel when I'm in town for business. A tad over priced for what you get, but overall good food. :)"}
{"text":"Good breakfast buffet. All you can eat, but it was a bit pricey.  Bar made good drinks and excellent service."}
{"text":"I have no idea why anyone says that the food here is anything short of extraordinary... I ordered the rabbit sausage and I can honestly say that the only reaction I can put together is \"thoroughly satisfied...\"  I would have given this place 5 stars but the wait was sort of hard to deal with, but I was glad that the food was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"While the food was good/standard restaraunt hotel food, the dinner entrees I got was smothered in oil. I asked for a side of steamed veggies and specified no oil... They came covered in butter. So... If you're looking for something healthy or even just something not overkill heavy, this is not a good place."}
{"text":"It's fine.  No, really, it's fine.  Seriously, it's fine.  I'm not being sarcastic, it's fine.  __________________________________  (this is just for the breakfast buffet, which I've had 10-15 times since I usually stay here when I come to Pittsburgh)"}
{"text":"Just don't. Best advice I could give you. The experience was horrendous the moment we stepped foot in the door. It was completely empty during what should have been the lunch rush. The waiter/host sat in the corner of the restaurant playing YouTube videos on his laptop and ignored us as we stood at the booth waiting to be seated. Throughout the meal, he would either disappear for long periods of time or be too occupied on his laptop to get his attention. Seriously, where did they find this guy??  The food itself was mediocre and completely overpriced for the quality. I ordered the veggie burger and it was crumbling all over my hands as I was attempting to eat it. I was most excited to see what the tofu bacon topping would be like but it was just slices of fried tofu. The deception! Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Since I've worked in the Steel Building for years I've had my share of lunches here. There's not much to be said other than disappointing. Overpriced frozen foods slopped on a plate in half-assed fashion.  That's all I've got. Sorry."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting family the other day and we decided to go to the Bigelow Grille. The overall experience was awesome and Our server Taylor was very nice and personable. The ribeye steak was delicious. I would go back again in a heartbeat, next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Poor people. The darn Pen's are on strike and the whole place is like a ghost town!   Considering I never come up this way, I wasn't even aware it existed. What lured us here really was a promise of complimentary breakfast buffet. If there's the word complimentary and buffet in a sentence, I'M THERE!  So this buffet to the untrained eye is fully loaded. Made to order omelets, french toast, waffles, cut grapefruit, many many kinds of pastries, yogurt and granola. etc, etc, etc. So, to sum it up, a crap load of food!  So as mass amounts of food are produced, I feel that the quality of food goes down. The eggs were dry, the home fries weren't as crispy as they should be and the grapefruit, not so fresh. I did, however, enjoy the French Toast and pastries. They were both fresh and delicious. Ironic that the worst things for you were the best. Of course!   Service was nice, if not a touch slow, you know when it's so slow in a restaurant that service is slow? Would I seek this place out again? No. But for another free buffet. Heck yes!"}
{"text":"Staying at the hotel this is the only option for breakfast from Double Tree Hotel. I walked in the door and the server 2 feet away blatantly ignored me to read the newspaper.   After standing there for a minute I had to interrupt and ask to be seated. She never greeted me but told me to sit anywhere then ignored me again this time at least five minutes. I then watched her give an elderly couple a warm welcome and took their coffee and juice order. Irritated I went to the tired buffet and started serving myself when the horrible server approached me to take my drink order. Ugh.   The food was mediocre at best paired with awful service I would rather starve then go through that agony. There as too many other good options for breakfast than to settle for this place."}
{"text":"Came here on a business trip and was happy to see that they had a nice looking bar and restaurant on site. Right away, however, I could tell it wasn't going to blow me away. The person I was sitting next to at the bar had their food come thirty minutes late and was audibly upset. My food was nothing to write home about and was still overpriced. It took way too long for the food to come out. The waitresses and bartenders were.., man, I really hate to say it, but they just didn't seem to want to be there, which made me feel the same."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant in the Doubletree.  A few very good craft beer selections. Arugula salad was tasty.  Scallops are/som of the best I have ever had.  Some other enticing options on th menu."}
{"text":"I'm always a little bit wary of hotel restaurants--they seem to vary so wildly in quality but tend to be less than stellar on balance.  I found Bigelow Grille on OpenTable, though, and so I made a reservation as an out-of-towner--I didn't need the reservation, though, as the place was almost totally empty at 8 PM on a Thursday.  The service was OK--the waiter seemed to be busy setting up other tables for customers that never arrived--but he also didn't seem to be too familiar with the wine list and looked confused when I asked him basic questions about the menu.  The food was decently priced.  My bill, including appetizer, wine, main course, coffee and tip was exactly $50.  However, the food was only OK.  The pan-seared calamari resembled pasta and was served with mushrooms that were a bit flaccid as well as a few undressed lettuce leaves inexplicably on the side.  The pork tenderloin was most definitely not served medium rare as I asked, but it still tasted good--it was flavorful enough but the whole dish was a bit one-note.  The food really struck me as more along the lines of what a good home cook (not an expertly trained chef) would turn out in a restaurant environment.  I don't want to pan the place entirely, as the prices are reasonable and the service is friendly... just don't expect to be jolted by the food."}
{"text":"I had lunch here last week mainly because of its convenient location.  Tom and I are considering leasing some office space in the building and thought we needed to gather all the information neccessary to make an informed decision (local bar and restaurant obviously having a solid influence).  I wasn't too excited to have lunch here I had wanted to try it years ago when Kevin Sousa gained local and some national attention for his alchemy menu, however that was several restaurants ago for Kevin and I believe he is now at Nine on Nine.  Anyways, we got there at about 1145 I think on Thursday.  The waitress came over and took our drink orders and then left us alone for a little too long... about 20 minutes however she probably thought we were busy since there was blueprints everywhere.  She finally came over and was friendly enough and took our order.   The space itself is minimalist with earth tone colors and a well stocked bar in the back.  It has hardwood floors plenty of sunlight and in general is a very adequate space and it's good there is a seperate entrance on the side to get to the restaurant without having to walk through the hotel lobby.  We started with some cold bread and cold oil of some type, kind of meh'.  Again, I wasn't expecting too much from this hotel restaurant.  I started with a cup of there soup of the day which was a spicy black bean soup, that was surprisingly... well... delicious I'd say.  My only complaint is that it wasn't that spicy and was served only slightly warm, not pipin' hot how most soup should be.  I ordered the BLT that came with Pierogies as an option for a side instead of just regular fries or a veggie.  The Pierogies were really good served perfectly sauteed with good potato and cheese filling and perfectly caramalized onions and sour cream.  i was really happy with this side, not just because it was an option as a side, but because it was executed perfectly.  My BLT was also really good.  It wasn't just normal or crispy bacon it was thick braised pork/bacon with a reallly delicious flavor served on really good quality sour dough bread with a nice slaw of some type instead of just lettuce.  The price was also good at $10 for the sandwich and sides.  It was a healthy portion. Speaking of prices I thought my cup of soup was a bit overpriced in comparison at $6 for the cup.  Tom had the \"Cheese Steak\", which wasn't steak at all but braised short ribs served wtih good quality amish chedder.  The fact that these folks put such care into the lunch menu makes me want to go back for Dinner.  I was pretty impressed and pleasantly surprised by this lunch spot and may be another check in the plus column in influencing to add space in this area.  I probably should give this place four stars, but I've been told recently that I'm too generous with the stars so maybe I'm a bit self conscious.  In either case I'll be back."}
{"text":"We came here for the Pierogis! They don't mention it in the menu but you have a choice of Pierogis for a side. We immediate got seated with chill water to start us off.   Order:  * Fried Chicken sandwich with pierogis which were amazing. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. It had crispy bacon, lettuce and tomato. The Pierogis were cooked to perfection with a dash of sour cream.   * Mac & Cheese was yummy. It came with fried tomatoes, bacon bits and bread crumbs. Tasty!   * Bigelow Burger with Pierogis was delicious. Can't go wrong with a burger.   Overall we enjoyed our meal. The service was ok. Oh and don't forget to ask about the specials! We'd come here again."}
{"text":"Holy YUM!   Hands down the best food I've had in years & years & years. This chef is an MVP rockstar and I want to be his best friend. The staff is amazing & here's what I ordered (you want ALL of it, I promise)! I had the Brussels, the lamb burger, the pierogies, tomato bisque & boston bib. (I am one of the pickiest eaters I know & this food was literally so freaking delicious. Never in my life have I ordered so much room service or frequented a restaurant in a hotel this much. You won't be disappointed.)   Honestly can't say enough about every staff member I encountered - from the people who brought the food to me (in my room & the restaurant) to the manager. They went above & beyond! Bless them!"}
