{"text":"As I'm strolling through the Carefree Holiday Festival I spot this lovely woman with a big smile on her face. Why is she smiling? Because she's surrounded by freshly made baked goods - that's why!  It also turns out that she's a very nice woman that clearly loves what she does.  And what she does is make excellent baked goods. I got the peach cobbler cookies and a small caramel apple pie. Wow! I've never had peach cobbler cookies before so I can't compare them to anything but they were delicious.  The apple pie was one of the best I've ever had. It was cooked to perfection and had just the right amount of spice.  She's working hard to get her business going. While I'm sure you'll see her at the major craft festivals you can also go to her shop or order online.  You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Came across this business at the Fountain Hills Arts and Crafts Festival.  OMG!!!!   THE BEST sweet potato pie I have EVER tasted!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  It's not just about the sweets and the great service.  They have a roast beef sandwich that is immaculate.    Its right off the freeway in the airpark, and has wireless internet so I was able to get some work done on my lunch break."}
{"text":"Love this place and the service is just delightful!!! The roast beef is excellent and the chicken salad is wonderful also.. The cookies and all of the other delicious desserts are a dream come true. The owner Dana and her husband Brian are a delight...and all of the other employees on staff are great also... Love this business and Wish them many Years of Success!! Isis L."}
{"text":"Loved the unique flavors of the cookies.  Perfect texture and tasted great! Got some as a gift and they were packaged beautifully.  Will try them again."}
{"text":"Dana is amazing! She worked with me to pull of some incredible sweets at a wedding last weekend. We had her do a cotton candy & lemonade interactive station. And then a wedding cake and a full cookie bar! I am still getting raves over it all! Thanks for everything. Can't wait to fill my sweet tooth next time I'm in town. As well every event I do out there I'll be pushing your delicious sweets! You rock!"}
{"text":"I've never written a review, but had to take the time to write one for this fabulous baker. We were at the Balloon Festival at Salt River Fields last night and stopped for a sweet treat. I had the pecan peach pie - what a wonderful combination of flavors. But the most incredible was the brownie my son had. No, not just a brownie. A double stuffed brownie, with two chocolate chip cookies oozing with caramel in the center of this rich, chocolate brownie. OMG!! Seek her out. Find her tent and try some of her heavenly goods. You won't be sorry."}
