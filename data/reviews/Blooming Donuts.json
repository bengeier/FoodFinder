{"text":"I'm in here at least once a week and cannot praise them enough. Their donuts are probably the best I've ever had--fresh, sweet, comforting. And they are always so friendly! We always get a strawberry sprinkle, classic glazed, and usually a croissant(bigger than my head and so light and flaky!). They always throw in complimentary donut holes with a dozen donuts, which is nice. Bonus: they open super early(4:30, I think)!"}
{"text":"Best donuts ever this place is so good they have a variety of donuts and coffee.They have great Customer service and very clean love this place"}
{"text":"Just had the most delicious scrumptious breakfast sandwich at the new blooming donuts across the street from our home,ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS..A croissant stuffed sandwich with ham cheese and jalapenos...The donuts are AWESOME too..my daughter had the stuffed sandwich with bacon and a egg,called a kalache also look delicious..SO Everyone try this place out..You will be in Donut heaven..."}
{"text":"These donuts were amazing fresh fluffy perfect I couldn't ask for a better donut I highly recommend blooming donuts to everyone"}
{"text":"Go nuts for these donuts.  These are soooooo much better than Dunkin or even KK.  Super soft and fresh.  Totally reasonably priced as well.   Service was great.  They have a donut they split in half like a hamburger bun and fill with white fluff.  So. Money...Tried the sausage egg and kolachi and the sausage jalapeno cheese croissant also.  Wouldn't get either of those again as they nuked them before serving.  Although I will say the croissant by itself was excellent.  This place is dangerous... nearby, cheap, delicious...  trifecta"}
{"text":"Stopped in since they opened near our home and I wasn't disappointed! I ordered my favorite maple long John it was yummy. I haven't tried the croissants yet but trust me I will. The girls were sweet and helpful and the prices are reasonable.
I got a Boba Tea no boba (not much of a custard ball kind of gal) and it was good. It's worth a trip to the donut shop! Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"So happy to have a decent donut shop in this area. I went in the middle of the afternoon and the donuts were still soft and fresh. The ladies working inside were friendly and greeted me as soon as I walked in. I also tried their Thai boba tea, and it was also very delicious. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Ummm... yeah, these are next-level donuts. I guess our expectations were pretty low (like even a bad donut is still pretty good, right?), but we have been thoroughly impressed by every donut we try, as well as the croissants and kolaches. 

Seriously such a good place in an area where most donut shops are just average. I can confidently say the maple bar is one of, if not THE best I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Donuts are great, Thai tea with boba great, prices... Even better.
Love that it's located near a residential neighborhood. Hours are very convenient."}
{"text":"I consider myself a donut expert and I had my first donut from Blooming Donuts this morning. Absolutely amazing. It will be my weekly reward for eating healthy all week. ;)"}
{"text":"Great donuts. I love that they basically keep making fresh donuts throughout the day instead of those places that make enough for the whole day and then they are out of all the good ones. If you enjoy donuts later in the day and not just in the morning this is the spot! The only thing is hopefully they make this specialty donuts like some fruity pebbles on top lol but no deal breaker still catch me here every other day"}
{"text":"Sooo yummy! The doughnuts felt like they melted in your mouth- fresh & soft! I'll definitely come back! 

I tried their watermelon slushie, it was good but I thought it would have been made with actual watermelon rather than artificial watermelon syrup."}
{"text":"I had these for breakfast AND they're the best donuts I've had in a LONG time. My favorite was the sugar coated donut...yum! Fluffy! I also had the stuffed cheese, potato, jalape√±o, and egg kolache sandwich. It was amazing!"}
{"text":"My family and I absolutely love this stop. All the staff is extremely nice and the inside is always very clean. There is no competition when comparing their donuts to other places. The donuts are perfectly fluffy and moist and don't ever taste like it's sat all day which I find at most places. The drinks are made fresh and a personal favorite of ours is the Honeydew with boba. The best part is you get better quality for less money which is unheard of these days. I can say you will not be disappointed at all by stopping here. Keep up the awesome service and quality!!! :)"}
{"text":"Best donuts ever! They taste fresh even the next day! The softest, fluffiest donuts I have ever had! Better than Krispy Kreme or Dunkin hands down! Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Love this donuts! They literally melt in your mouth. They are light, fluffy, and FRESH! My favorite is the old fashioned with chocolate. Must try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best donuts I have had in a long time , great variety and good customer service, will be coming back often 
Best donuts in tolleson"}
{"text":"The donuts here are deceptively light and fluffy!  These may look like regular donuts you can get from a grocery store bakery but they are not! These are definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Great Doughnuts!!! I was really impressed with the doughnuts. They were light and fluffy, warm and fresh. My doughnut of choice is usually a plain glazed doughnut. Their glazed doughnut seems twice as big as Krispy Kreme's doughnuts! In my opinion, it tasted better that the most recent Krispy Kreme doughnut I have had! I really enjoyed my doughnut and look forward to trying the other flavors.

I haven't tried their coffee or boba yet, which will be on the agenda of my next visit!"}
{"text":"Try their donuts for the first time, they are delicious and we definitely love the price. Very affordable. We order a dozen donuts to go, when we got home we were surprised with little donut holes in our box as an added extra."}
{"text":"Super yummy donuts and great customer service! So glad I live only 5 minutes away! Could go here everyday!!"}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood and I'm oh so grateful!  I went in for my first visit around noon and assumed there may not be any fresh donuts left.  Boy was I wrong!  There were all kinds of selections and still warm!  I had a warm glazed and I got a plain croissant (huge) for later.  Mouth-watering deliciousness.  They don't just make he donuts at 3 am, they make them all day!  Finally a local shop that stays open throughout the afternoon, until 8 pm!  Donuts, not just for breakfast anymore."}
{"text":"Whoop whoop!! Awesome moist donuts, so moist that you'll need a boba drink to wash it down! Fast efficient and very friendly service, their prices are reasonable. We loved their ham and cheese croissants and their bacon maple bar. Soooo yummyyy!!"}
{"text":"Best place I've been too. Customer service and everything they serve here is amazing. Couldn't ask for a better experience"}
{"text":"Amazin it's the best everything is cheap and Affordable please go to blooming donuts and always pease out"}
{"text":"These donuts are SO GOOD! I'm from Portland and I'm talking like Voodoo Doughnuts good.. maybe not as creative but then they have boba milk teas so.. it makes up for it! And the owners are so sweet- I hope this place succeeds!"}
{"text":"Stopped in the first week they opened. Figured we'd give them a try since it's the only donut shop, close to home that's opened since we've lived in tolleson. Anyway, it was about 1pm when we stopped in..the donuts were fresh, they had good selection too, not like most shops they'd be ready to close by that time. We had a old fashioned donut and a cream filled chocolate donut ..and a Thai tea (skipped the boba) ...the donuts were delicious and the tea was perfect not overwhelmingly sweet and not watered down..just right. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Ok I waited until I got donuts from here at least three times. People. These are quality, amazing donuts.
I've tried em all over the valley (I'm from NYC so we have a thing for quality baked goods lol).
Yes as another reviewer said, these are next level.
Not greasy - not above normal I mean.
Fillings are yummy. Ok I'm a jelly donut snob, so I don't like jellies anywhere except for this one place in NY but that's me..

The creme filled ones here, so good.
Glazed twists??? Omg you'll never eat another round glazed donut once you pull apart a glazed twist... think pretzel effect in the twisty parts and you get the idea!

Their maple bacon bars are amazing. 

Not much a fan of the sausage croissant as it was more of a big hot dog lol. But hey you're not coming here for that anyway.

Donuts. Try them. You will love them!!"}
