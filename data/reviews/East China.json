{"text":"Best chinese spot around period.  I love everything and if you ask her to make it hot she will.  also best spare ribs i have ever had."}
{"text":"The owner of this business called the police because he felt I used counterfeit currency to pay    him.  The police made me go back to his restaurant and replace the bills which were not counterfeit with new bills for no reason whatsoever.  They do not accept credit cards or debit cards and I feel the owner does this to evade taxes.  The food sucks and the prices are high.  I started going to Panda Express at Cedar Center and they have high quality food at decent prices and the people who work there a good people, unlike the owner of this hole in the wall.  I will never go there again."}
{"text":"THEIR FOOD LATELY HAS BEEN TERRIBLE! We love orange chicken so that's usually what we order from this place. It used to be awesome, but the past 3 times we've gone it just has not been right; the chicken gets harder and drier each time! Last night we decided to try it again since it's right down the street, only to be disappointed once again. Biting down on a piece of this orange chicken was like biting down on a extra crispy ball of grease saturated fried batter. The chicken had been so severely overcooked it was hardly noticeable when we opened up one of the unappetizing balls of crunchy-ness. Bottom line this place will NEVER get our business again! P.S. customer service sucks unless a male takes your order which doesn't happen often."}
{"text":"They completely forgot about our order for 2 hours. When we called, they tried to cover it up. The food was conveniently here 5 minutes later, and showed up cold. Not even good flavor. Dont waste your time."}
{"text":"Ordered from here a few times and thought it was execllent... great flavors and not greasy at all"}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times since it first opened. The food is excellent, they have a large menu with everything being very tasty. I haven't found another Wonton Soup that I like better than theirs in over 10 years.   The only setback is some of the staff. They have young children answer their phones, and most of the time these kids are down right rude. They are extremely short when you call to place an order, I understand that they may not speak English very well, but still. They could at least learn how to say please and thank you! I called to order dinner for my mom and me one evening and the kid who took our order over the phone told us we could not get a side of mixed vegetables for my mother. When I went in to pick up my food and talked to an older lady, she appologized and gave us the veggies without an arguement.   Overall, their menu is awesome. You get a lot of food for your money and I won't stop coming in because it's my favorite chinese food in this area.I feel that they could improve with a bigger adult staff to answer phones and help check customers out. Other than that this place is enjoyable."}
{"text":"Amazing place, Great People, Awesome Food. The Shrimp Egg Foo Young, Shrimp Fried Rice, General Tso Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Pepper Steak and Egg Rolls are to die for. I've been going to this place for 30+ years... the only Chinese restaurant I will ever go to in Ohio. A+"}
{"text":"Ugh. The young lady at the front desk obviously doesn't want to be there. I could hear her cursing when she went to get my food.  Actually I wish she'd kept my food. It was so bland. No flavor. Hot Sour soup wasn't spicy at all. Nor the kung pao chicken. What a disappointment. I should have stayed with Jackie Chen's down the road. That's what I get for being unfaithful!"}
{"text":"We have tried several Chinese places in the area, and this is the only place that does it right. General Tso chicken is crispy with a sweet and spicy sauce, Singapore noodle is deliciously prepared with just the right amount of curry, and the hot and sour soup has the perfect texture and flavor.  This is not a sit-down place. It's seedy looking, it's run by a family, often staffed up front by the teen children. Call your order in and pick it up in 30-40 mins. Take it home and enjoy the spectacular fresh flavors.  Fantastic food!"}
{"text":"Good stuff baby!!!! Call ahead so when you walk in...its ready! or stumble in from the infamous knuckies next door..and order..take a seat..then get out! good stuff with good prices, especially for the lunch specials..M-Saturday open till 4 pm(I THINK)."}
{"text":"Everything is good at this neighborhood staple.  Portions are tasty and generous and full of shrimp or pork.  They are fast & friendly.  Haven't had anything I didn't like yet.   Cash only - carry out."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall Chinese that never disappoints: good food, easy to order, great prices and ready quick. We crave the pork fried rice and fight over the left overs. We're also big fans of the egg rolls, crab rangoon, beef & broccoli and hot & sour soup. As new Cleveland residents, we're delighted to have a go-to Chinese restaurant down the street."}
{"text":"Ordered online. It said it would be about 30-60 minutes. When it got to an hour I called & asked if my food was on the way or if something happen she said oh yeah it's leaving now. Then took another 20 minutes. ( I live a mile down the road) & on top of that the food want even warm. Just moved to the area and never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered twice from here to make sure first time wasn't just a fluke. Ordered HOT General tzo's both times and there was no heat at all. Why have a preference then? Always should be spicy and there was nothing whatsoever. Poorly made food as well. Fried rice was fine but the sauce was just horrible. Never again. Don't bother trying."}
{"text":"Food was good but the delivery man was so rude. I ordered food from here and 90 minutes later my order finally arrived. On top of being late, the delivery guy screamed at me because he had to drive 14 miles to my house (I checked Google maps and I only live about 7 miles away). Anyway, I found his behavior absolutely unacceptable, and rude. It is not my fault management thinks that the distance to my home is acceptable for food delivery. I would've understood if they'd called and let me know my address was outside of their area, but they did not. Horrible service, they really  need some new delivery people."}
{"text":"The food is great and I have had this many times and each time it tastes amazing.   However, the individuals that take orders and deliver are extremely rude. After receiving a tip, the deliver driver counted the money and asked, \"That's it?\", it was rude and embarrassing.  I could highly recommend the food, the individuals working there are a lot better at making the food than providing customer service."}
{"text":"This place has gone from ok to unedible. Crab rangoon was ok. Chicken with broccoli was a big no. Butterfly shrimp was so bad, the dog didn't want to eat it (but he's a dog so eventually he did)."}
{"text":"Ordered two chicken dinners last night for delivery and it never showed up, I didn't even want to waste my time and call them to complain. Do yourself a favor and order elsewhere, this is far from the first problem my family has had with them."}
{"text":"We ordered from here for several years and enjoyed their food, but the customer service from the owner is terrible. When you call in an order there's usually a child that answers the phone, so you have to repeat several times what you want. When you pick your food up the lady that owns the place is so rude. She treats you like she doesn't want you in her restaurant. I thought it was just me, but then several of my friends have said the same thing. I have also seen these comments on a few Yelp reviews. If she wants my business again, she needs to change her attitude towards her customers. I don't appreciate my food and credit card being thrown at me while I'm at the counter. I will continue to order from China Express where they appreciate you as a customer and their food is always exceptional!"}
{"text":"Noooooo!!!! I went to order some food and one of their cooks walked in and sneezed into his hands. Normally that would be fine....if he washed his hands!!! The cook went straight to cooking without cleaning himself!! Then I told the owner about it and when she talked to \"the sneezer\" he said he wasn't cooking my food so it was okay and I didn't need to worry. The owner agreed and he continued cooking. I'm baffled. Don't go here if you want clean food. To die for literally."}
{"text":"Slow. The General Tso chicken: no flavor or spice even though there were dried red chillies mixed in, chicken piece were tough, fatty, low quality cuts. The fried rice was good but I usually just get steamed, which I forgot to do today."}
{"text":"Went here to get some lo mien and egg drop soup! People are fast here but the store seems a bit runned down.  The prices are reasonable and you get what you pay for.  I feel like their food is pretty good and they aren't shy with the portions so I'm not complaining.  It's said to read that there are some complaints about the customer service here but these people mean business.  Definitely look at their website or their menu before ordering so you know exactly what you want.  If you just have them stand there for a long time to order then nothing would get done or food would probably start burning... Sometimes I see 1-3 people there so give some of these people a break.."}
{"text":"Increasingly heading downhill. The last few orders have not been processed by the time we have gone to pick up. The last delivery order on a slow night took 80 minutes to be delivered (we live 3 minutes from the restaurant). When the orders do get processed, they have been screwed up in at least one fashion, including one occasion when they failed to put any sauce on the chicken. If you do get your order made correctly, without any foreign matter in it, it's usually pretty decent."}
{"text":"I usually get my Chinese food from Dragon Gate but they don't deliver, and its way to cold outside. My sister recommended East China, so I decided to give it a try. The customer service leaves a lot to be desired. I almost felt like I was bothering them when I called to place my order.        I ordered the Pepper Steak dinner with $2 extra meat, and an extra Egg Roll. My Fiancé got the Sweet and Sour Chicken dinner.  The lady taking my order gave me a total cost of $18.61 which seems like a good deal. I had to stop her from hanging up on me to get told it would be there in 45 minutes, but  the food was delivered in 30. Which was a nice surprise.       The food was great and there was plenty of it. I was really surprised when I looked back in the bag and discovered they put in duck sauce without me remembering to ask. I ate all of my dinner and was so full,  I did not even eat my 2nd egg roll. My Fiance could not finish her meal but really enjoyed it. On cold nights Chinese is now going to be ordered from here. Other then placing the order I really like this place. I might even rethink Dragon Gate as my top choice."}
{"text":"This is a classic hole-in-the-wall carry out joint. The new owners/staff are all right and the food all right as well. Food is ready relatively quickly.   Nothing to write home about, but not offensive.    They only take cash at this time but if you have a bank card you can use the ATM unit that's sitting on the counter. You are charged $2, then you get maybe a dollar back from the cashier.   So bring cash."}
{"text":"Definitely a hole in the wall spot but its sooooooooooooooo good!!!!!!  What did I get...EGG FOO YOUNG of course! They do it right!!!!! (see list in profile). Along with the egg foo young I got shrimp fried rice and an egg roll...all was delicious and I just wish they did Egg Foo Young like this on the West Coast!  Its only carryout so plan accordingly but its so worth it...get your sauces and napkins and go to town when you get home!"}
{"text":"Severely crabby people, leave the service industry if you are so mad at the world. Zero people skills. We keep going back because it is good food, but the people are just unbearable."}
{"text":"Awful is the only word I could use to sum this place up. It may be cheap and fast, but that is exactly what you get. Fried rice tastes like dirt. Chicken Lo Mein had no flavor and the consistency of a bowl of snot. And everything else we got was just utterly disappointing with little to no flavor. Don't waste your money. You are better off getting a bag of frozen Chinese food from the grocery store and eating it cold. Worst Chinese food ever!!!"}
