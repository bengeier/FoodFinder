{"text":"I am from Scotland and believe you me the pies, bridies and sausage rolls are pretty far away from what gets served back home. Something very odd about the meat fillings. Tastes the same in all three. Sort of sour is the overpowering flavour. Weird and not very nice. I didn't finish any of the three. Was a big disappointment. 

If you're an ex-pat looking for a wee taste of home, wait until you get home and go to Greggs. 

Either the chap who runs it (apparently a Scotsman) has never tasted his wares, or just doesn't care.

{"text":"White Heather Scottish Bakery entrance is on Green St, with a dining option including a Scottish Breakfast for a very reasonable price, but quality is uneven.  The Scottish breakfast is too large a portion, the black pudding was burnt.  Scottish baked goods including authentic meat pies, shortbread.  The meat in the meat pies are tasty, but the crust on the meat pies though authentic, I would prefer a much more delicate flaky crust.

Besides coming here for their food is also for a chance to interact with the owner Frank, a real Scottish character.

Credit cards accepted, street parking.  Open Monday-Friday 10am-7pm, Saturday 9am-6pm, Sunday 10am-4pm."}
{"text":"White Heather Scottish Bakery Ltd. is as authentic Scottish as one can expect. 

Most of the customers that dropped by on this particular afternoon were usual customers as they were all greeted by their first names!

The meat pie ($3.20) I have was excellent as a snack!! The lady reheated it and it was so hot!! I almost burn my mouth! If you just want to buy one to go it is only $2!

They also have afternoon tea specials with pot of tea and scones.

White Heather has this really homey feel... I felt like I was in a small restaurant at one of the little English Village!

BTW, they also carries British groceries and candies!!"}
