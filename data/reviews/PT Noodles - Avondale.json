{"text":"If you eat pho I would come & check this place out. Wonderful service with excellent food for the family. Another restaurant added to the date night choices."}
{"text":"100% unsatisfied with my visit here. They use a strong chemical to clean their tables and we watched as one of their servers handle silverware without washing her hands after cleaning the tables. We had asked to speak to a manager and without respecting our wishes we were greeted by a rude lady who wasn't the manager and just stood there and mocked us saying \"ok I'll tell her, is there anything else?\" When mentioning the chemical was strong she said specifically they used \"saline\" which should be scentless that and they should be using sanitizer and even so shouldn't have such a strong chemical scent as my wife is pregnant. Clearly disregarding customer satisfaction as she was very rude and spoke to us like we were stupid. Won't be coming here ever again."}
{"text":"The service was good, and the restaurant is nice and clean. 

We got the spring rolls, the special pho, and a combo rice dish. I wanted the bun bo hue, but they were out. The spring rolls were fresh, but the peanut sauce was not my favorite. The pho noodles were choppy as opposed to continuous long strands. The sauces on the shrimp skewer were a little too sweet for me. Overall, I've had better. 

Oh and also, they have macaroon ice cream sandwiches."}
{"text":"Just got back from PTNoodle and I can say without hesitation that this is by far one of the finest noodle houses in Phoenix. The portions are large and the service is fast. Shortly after seating us we ordered our noodles and they arrived. Flavor was excellent and temperature was perfect. Wait staff was very attentive and all our needs were met. Overall we had a wonderful experience and we can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Ordered combo fried rice, brisket pho and 2 orders of spring rolls. Pho came out first, fried rice a little after that. 10 minutes after, asked about our springs rolls and the waiter said he forgot them. Fried rice and pho seemed to be lacking flavor. Service wasn't that great. 2 waiter and 2 kitchen staff were gossiping in Spanish. And a little pricey in my opinion. Pho house is much more flavorful, cheaper and great service."}
{"text":"Definitely the best pho in Avondale. I used to go to their other location on Mcdowell and Litchfield and was excited when they opened this one because it's closer to home. The service is good and they have call buttons on every table to ensure you are being taken care of. The boba, Vietnamese iced coffee, and teas are pretty good as well. Comfortable atmosphere"}
{"text":"We actually love this place it's one of our favorites in town when you're feeling about noodles you could feel this PT noodles in Avondale I got to say they are absolutely the best"}
{"text":"This is my first time at PT Noodles food was amazing prices are great and the service was amazing!!!Deffenetly recamend this place!"}
{"text":"So glad these guys opened up another one closer to us! The food is amazing- the pho and Thai iced tea are my favorites. Service is friendly and the place is very nice. Family owned and their pride shows!"}
{"text":"Wow. Really nice place. The food is outstanding. The staffs here are just so friendly. Feels very welcoming here by everyone.
The place is big enough where you can feel very comfortable. It's very very clean as well.
So glad this Vietnamese Restaurant opened here. Not thing as good as this place around here.
I've been to their other locations as well and I'm sure to say that they're very good and consistent. 
Highly recommended to everyone."}
{"text":"Want great flavor and shareable portions, then this is your place. We had the Special Pho, Curry Ga and Combination fried rice, all three dishes were outstanding. Great prices and quick service.
The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. 
I can't rave enough about the chicken curry. Creamy flavor and homemade taste. Veggies were on point and chicken was delicious. A must try!!"}
{"text":"The waiter was nice my daughter and I really enjoyed our meal however, I'm Sorry to have to do this but I had to Update: I got home and was super sick after eating Pho. I called and asked them if they use MSG and they do use it in their Pho so that was probably why I got sick. MSG always makes my stomach upset and hurt. I wish they didn't use MSG Pho43 doesn't use MSG."}
{"text":"Nice go to spot for Ph√≥.  They couldn't have picked a better spot to open.  Near Harkins Theatre's and many other restaurants opening in the area, it's a good option for someone wanting to try something new...or new to them anyways."}
{"text":"I took my family and friends here for the  first time and i just need to say that The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing.all service staff were very helpful and cordial from check in to check out the staff were fantastic! All the reviews ive read about their restaurant are all true! quality, expert restauranteurs, ambiance. They aren't happy unless you are happy. Food has Flavor
Just go and be happy 
And no, I don't work here or have any other reason to praise only that they deserve it. The food is topnotch!!"}
{"text":"Very good food, excellent service and chief prepared an excellent Birds Nest Can't wait for new location to open in Central Phx (7th Ave and Camelback ) in April"}
{"text":"I have came to Pt Noodle for a long time . They always give me a good service and amazing food  . I will bring my family to there at weekend."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Litchfield location, the new one in Avondale off of Mcdowell was a surprise to me. I always enjoy there Chicken Pho, never disappoints so far."}
{"text":"Just had my first meal there and it was really delicious! I had the Special Noodle Bowl (might be wrong but I'm pretty sure that's what it was called). The service was really good as well and I love the atmosphere of the place. One thing though that I noticed when I walked in was the smell, it smelled a little off but it might of been just me because I'm not used to the smell of a noodle shop. Overall I really do recommend this place if you're in the area looking for something new and fresh!"}
{"text":"Servers are very welcoming and friendly, service is quick and helpful when needed. The manager is very kind and friendly, great place to eat at, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant for pho! This location has plenty of spacious seating and the prices aren't going to hurt your pockets. It is always clean and a nice atmosphere. The staff have always been super friendly and welcoming, we've become regulars we love it so much! The food is delicious, I love the pho! They have plenty of options to choose from on their menu with lots of variety. If you have a picky child like mine, they are so sweet about accommodating you. We always enjoy ourselves here. They also have great boba drinks and milk tea. Overall, I recommend for anyone to try because it really is a great restaurant."}
{"text":"The service here is really good! The manager is really helpful and very nice! The food is a little bit expensive but it worth it!!!!! My server Erica is really helpful and really fun to hold a conversation with!!! I'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent special pho. Have had it many times at new location. Get it to go on a cold winter night.  

Call in ordering fast and problem free. Friendly employees"}
{"text":"Best service and great food! Haven't had pho since I moved from LA, because LA is packed with Pho restaurants. The boba is also amazing! Better than bomboba!"}
{"text":"Tried the place today and nothing special compared to the Da Vang's here in Phoenix. The price was 2-3-4 dollars more and it all adds up... The $3.50 Bubble tea at other places with fresh fruits are way over priced... Maybe it's their over head that they have to pay for, but my honest opinion the food is way overpriced and and have it 3 stars because the food is okay.."}
{"text":"The food I ordered is average, knowing that there is a better Vietnamese restaurant in the west valley (Little Saigon).  The service is a little awkward because you need to press a bell on your table for service.
I heard some of the food on the menu are good.  I want to try them next time to see if I can raise my review."}
{"text":"I got take out last week and upon finishing I got sick and it lasted for 2 days.  I thought perhaps the onions were not cooked through the way I liked it and sometimes onions do irritate some people.  I went back yesterday and gave it another try during happy hour (3-5pm).  The iced tea was weak like water, the spring roll was totally bland and the sliced beef in the Pho was over cooked and not tender.  I was not full upon leaving and was hungry literally a half hour later.  The waiter who was training my waitress served my pho without a spoon and small sauce dish and no one came back to check on me.  I gave my 20% tips.  as much as I love Vietnamese food but there was nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Nice and clean place to enjoy good traditional Vietnamese food i totally recommend!! And customer service so friendly!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is poppin on a Friday nite! That's always a good sign. Super comfortable, contemporary, clean and inviting.  The food is traditional and temperature of all the dishes coming out was perfect, hot food hot, cold food cold!  Everything made from scratch and they use fresh ingredients, this place is legit!  Here's what happened to me when I visited for the first time...The staff are friendly, helpful and attentive to customers needs. I witnessed a customer break a dish at their table and the manager and server ran to immediately assist those customers! No one is standing around playing on their phones.  I like when the customer is priority!  I didn't order much compared to the variety of what's actually available on the menu so I had something basic to start. Crispy rolls and shrimp spring rolls. Wow! These crispy rolls are amazing. Perfectly crispy crunchy on the outside and filled with pork and vegetable and seasoned to perfection. Nice and hot served with fresh mint and fish sauce for dipping, thank you for these are the best I've ever had! The shrimp spring roll was delicious. Fresh mint and romaine and sweet delicate shrimps dipping sauce oh so yum!  The shrimp curry was coco nutty and mildy spiced excellent flavors and fresh French bread on the side for dipping. But best of all was my pineapple salad! As Chandler's old girlfriend from Friends would say \" Oh...My...Gawd\"... a little sweet a little spice perfect dressing full of fresh veggies like carrot, cucumber, sweet onion n mint with tender sliced pork n shrimp perfectly sliced and bite sized for eating pleasure! And how adorable is this salad in a pineapple boat! My mouth took off to the tropics! Our server Jason was perfect...energetic, focused, and happy!  Happy servers make the visit more enjoyable! And like Schwarzenegger says: \"I'll be back!!!!!\""}
{"text":"We stopped by this location to take a break and look around after a long drive from Sacramento. We decided to have lunch here and glad we did. 

It was a late Monday afternoon and the place was pretty quiet. First their menu was unique with a cool design on the front, I loved it. Set up was pretty typical but their decor are unique Vietnamese pieces with a clean environment. 

We ordered their happy hour pho which comes with a choice of 1 spring roll or egg roll and a soda. Chicken viet sandwich, Vietnamese traditional coffee, and a boba drink to go. The pho broth was fresh, light, and clean with a hint of sweetness. The sandwich was really delicious too, loved the chicken meat, you can taste the lemongrass herbs in it. Overall, delicious food and service was great! However, I was disappointed that they didn't make my boba drink towards the end because I can tell, it's been sitting and waiting for us. The smoothie was melted already but it was delicious because they use actual fruits to make instead of powder. 

If we live in the area, this would be our to go place. Therefore, we would recommend this location for everyone who loves asian food or want to explore food outside their comfort zone."}
{"text":"Worst service that wasn't just attentive but not informative either. Over charged us! Oily broth as you'll see in photos. Never will eat here again"}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and well decorated. The staff is always very prompt and friendly. The food is amazing. I've gotten different phos, rice vermicelli, and banh mi and they were all delicious. The only complaint I have is they never seem to have boba ready by the time they open."}
{"text":"Pho is a common Vietnamese menu item. The soup is low in fat and supplies several key vitamins and minerals.  One can say that pho is good *pho* you.  ;D  Don't hurt me.

I've been wanting to try PT Noodles for the longest time.  My bestest gal pals in the world love this place and when they finally opened one so close to my work, I had to give them a try!  Gotta love an eatery that stays open until 10:00 PM!

So the price is a bit on the higher end of the spectrum.  My \"Pho with Rare Steak and Tendon\" was $8.29 but I was still impressed.  I had asked for my steak to be on the side and wow, the quality!  Was I looking at raw meat or fresh cut tuna?  Dat color!  The soup itself was very flavorful and clean.  I'm absolutely drooling over how good it was upon reflection.  My friend had got the \"Special Noodle Soup\" for $10.99 and was depressed over his overcooked chicken but that's for him to cry about in his own Yelp review.  My bowl was bomb. 

Upon my second visit, I got the Papaya Salad with Pork & Shrimp and shared an order of spring rolls.  The papaya salad was massive and super refreshing with great flavor.  I also enjoyed the spring rolls although I wish they had peanut sauce and not just hoisin sauce with crushed peanuts.

Most of the staff is great.  There has only been one person I didn't care for, the younger lady, who was inattentive, rude to her co-workers, and turned the lights off on us while we were packing up to leave. On the other hand, I especially like the manager that runs the register with the cool hair!  He's great and yelled at the staff to turn the lights back on since there were still customers in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"The servers at this location have no customer service experience. They're rude and non-attentive. They all stand around in the corner on their phones or just talking to each other. We were greeted as we walked in, but no one bothered to get our drink orders. After about waiting 15 mins or so, someone finally comes up to us and asked if we were ready to order. As we were waiting for our food, the table behind us was getting wiped down. We couldn't help but notice the strong chemical scent that was coming from it. Even after 30 mins, it was still strong. I am pregnant so inhaling strong chemicals like that gave me a huge headache and made me feel sick. We were observing while waiting for our food and noticed that the server who had just wiped down the chemical was now touching all kinds of silverware without washing her hands. Those silverware were used and put into our soups and dishes. We then asked the guy who came to our table to see a manager but he ignored us. When he came back, I asked if I can see the manager now and so he called a \"manager\" over. This was no manager I tell you and if she was the she doesn't know how to be a manager. She listened to our complaint about the chemical and said to us, \"it's not chemical it's saline water.\" We told her we could smell a strong chemical scent and she said with attitude, \"we use saline water.\" Saline water should be scentless and even so, every restaurant should be using sanitizer water for health purposes. After complaining to the \"manager,\" she looked at us as if we were dumb and said, \"is that it?\" First of all, what kind of manager says that to their customers? This business obviously did not care whether or not their customers left satisfied. The food isn't even good. Every soup based dish is sweet and the bun bo hue barely had any noodles. Very disappointed with how the \"manager\" treated us. No apology, no attempt at trying to keep customers satisfied, nothing."}
{"text":"Went to Harkin's theater watch jumanji was a great movie but was craving soup so decided to look on yelp and seen PT noodles wanted to give a try and glad I did the bun bo hue was amazing definitely coming back!! Recommend this place!"}
