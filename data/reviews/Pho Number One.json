{"text":"It's just not right Thai Food / Vietnamese combine ? Thai food just doesn't go with it"}
{"text":"Such wonderful people  Very tasteful decor   Wonderful food and reasonably priced   Always fresh and top quality ingredients   Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This place has the best pho I've ever had. The broth is real warm and the noodles are perfectly cooked. Last time, I got pho with brisket and meat balls. The broth was out of this world and the meat cooked to perfection. You won't regret coming to this place, I'm a frequent customer."}
{"text":"Meh. The service deserves 1 star, food 2.5 stars. The soup is way too sweet and the ingredients too little. I just don't understand the great reviews here."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! It's straight up traditional food without any Euro funky twist that a lot of places are now doing.  Let's be honest, some places cater to more American clienteles while others keep it real with the right ingredients.  THIS IS LEGIT !!!  It's a bit of a drive for me, BUT worth it.  Pho & Bun Bo Hue are my favorite hot soups, and Bun Thit Nuong (cold noodle dish) & Com Suong (Rice Dish) are also delicious.  If you're craving authentic Vietnamese food at a reasonable price then this is it.  Happy Eating :)"}
{"text":"I came here for a large bowl of hot soup to cure my allergy, so rather than Pho, I decided to have their Bun Bo Hue (Spicy Beef Noodle Hue Style). The noodles were cooked perfectly. At some other Vietnamese restaurants I can tell that they just microwave the noodles and they're still hard. I love their Bun Bo Hue, it's not too authentic, and not so much \"Americanized\". However, servers are not friendly at all. I feel like they just gave me the menu, gave me the food, they don't care about the serving etiquettes whatsoever. Not even a smile on their faces. So maybe for next time, I just order for take-out."}
{"text":"Best pho ever. I eat here 2 or 3 times a month if not more. Fresh ingredients, hot broth, friendly staff and great prices every time."}
{"text":"Hands down, BEST BUN BO HUE IN AZ. Very comparable to places in Little Saigon areas in SoCal. The broth is very authentic! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars but every time I come here the waiters always have a long face, they never smile. It seems like they hate their job. If it wasn't for the good Pho I wouldn't even come here to eat.  BTW I've been here 6 times, even on slow days.   **Waiters please SMILE and be more welcoming**"}
{"text":"Great location, ample parking and excellent pho.  I stopped by for takeout and the service was friendly and very quick. I ordered Pho Bo Vien and it was amazing.  Best Pho broth and plenty of side vegetables to compliment.  Great atmosphere and very clean."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this place I order the Pho Tai and still the best pho tai I have ever had. I tried on going to other places but this Pho Tai always calls me back. cant top the broth its so flavorful and the meat is so nicely cleaned out with no fat and this delicious pho is always served hot so that my meat can cook by the time I put in veggies and lime. Top it off the restaurant is always clean ready for the next customer and the décor is beautiful."}
{"text":"Ordered pho with chicken to go. The inside was nicer than I anticipated as I was just wanting to grab lunch. There were people sitting and enjoying lunch with servers delivering their dishes. I ordered at the bar. $8 for my soup. When I opened my soup the soup container had just broth and the to go box has the noodles, shredded chicken, sweet chili paste, cilantro, onions, jalapeño,basil, and bean sprouts. I put all of it except the basil into my broth. My ears were ringing from the heat, my nose was running, my heart was stolen. I will be back- and this time with a lunch date!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible. I ordered the Com Dac Biet and there was NOTHING special about it. Everything came out cold and icky. It was bland, and oily. My parents ordered the Pho Dac Biet and all they got was a jumbo bowl of broth. Three tiny pieces of meat. Horrible service. Not only did the server spill sauce everywhere but he was also rude. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!! Im from N. California, Sacramento/The Bay Area where their is are million Pho restaurant. I've been searching for a really good Pho restaurant in Phoenix,  Az , and I have found the place!!!! I had the Bun Bo Hue! OMG!!! some of the best Bun Bo Hue I've truly tasted before, flavorful and traditional. If your looking for Pho in Phoenix THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came in at a time that is not busy, I'm still here. My food came out cold. I ordered the combination rice plate and everything was cool or cold except for the rice. I've had many combination plates in the past and this is by far the most lacking. There were only two variations of shredded meat, an egg, egg rolls, and two cold shrimps. No usual pork chop. For an almost thirteen dollar plate, it is extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for pho tai. I'm hesitant to even write this review simply because I fear one day having to wait for a table when my craving my favorite soup. But, they're awesome so here we go... First of all, I've had pho all over the valley and this place is the best! It is consistent and absolutely delicious! The family has excellent customer service and always greet you with a smile. They know their regulars and their orders. I love that I can walk in and they already know what I want . It's so good I order it to go and enjoy it at home!"}
{"text":"First time I went to this place with my family and we all liked the food. Place is very clean also. The only bad note were the waiters, not even the slightest smile."}
{"text":"Love this place. I'd never had Pho before but they've made a believer out of me. I'm also a huge fan of their rice paper wrapped rolls. Not usually sure whats in them but they're delicious! I meet with a friend who drives 45 minutes just to come to this restaurant. Also has very reasonable prices. I'll be going back again, and again, and again."}
{"text":"Pho was ok but not fantastic! Noodles were hard and soup based too sweet for me. Waiter not very friendly but the place looks relatively clean."}
{"text":"I ordered meatball pho the broth was amazing flavor and fresh veggies. My boyfriend order pad Thai chicken and it was some of the best pad Thai I've had in Arizona. The price is affordable and we were very happy."}
{"text":"Delicious, quick, cheap! Went there with a couple friends today and it was just amazing! Ordered the pho with brisket. Also, great atmosphere and really nice decor. Will be returning many times!"}
{"text":"Closed for vacation until 6/8/16. Looks clean. Bummer we drove 30 minutes to get here."}
{"text":"This place has not only destroyed my favorite dish but has also offended a national cuisine.  Pho is the national Vietnamese dish. If it wasn't, there wouldn't be so many restaurants with it in the name like this place.  Any place worth its salt has a go-to recipe that satisfies anyone craving the soup.    So who can mess up something as important as Pho?  This place.  They have done it in a manner that offends Vietnamese cuisine in no other way I have ever before experienced.  This national cuisine is considered one of, if not THE, freshest food on the planet.    Who ruins Pho Ga?  This place.  Unfortunately, this place has no idea about freshness.  Pho is a healthy, nutritious, and savory soup.  Simple, yet elegant.  The atrocity they served me was not only bland, but so oily that I couldn't get rid of the clammy sensation from my mouth for hours.  The meager chicken pieces floating in it were not only bland, but exceedingly DRY.  So dry that I had to drink the bland iced tea they served so as to swallow, because the broth was so oily and revolting.  Unfortunately, I was so hungry I forced myself to gnaw on the the chicken and the hard noodles.  My partner's hot and spicy soup with shrimp was as greasy or more.  In fact, the oil beaded up on our spoons repelling the water-based soup.  She said the shrimp had freezer burn in its taste.  She also tried to salvage something edible from her horror.  The sad thing is that we spent over 30 minutes trying to find the place as a result of Yelp when we looked for a place in Mesa.  So I had to warn people about this joint.  Unfortunately, we weren't aware that there were 2 different places right down the road in Chandler.  So for Vietnamese cuisine's sake - Do NOT eat here.  I wish we could get away with not having to give one star.  It was so bad.  The sad thing is that the appetizer of Spring Rolls was actually decent, then the crap hit the fan.  Or in this case, the Pho."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo good.   Love it.  2nd time in a week I'm here.   Hits the spot.   One bowl fills me up and I am totally content!"}
{"text":"Very good! Great service. Clean. I had the vegetarian pho. Broth had  a lot of flavor. Vietnamese coffee is amazing! We will be back."}
{"text":"The Pho is great! The main dishes are great as well, I would recommend it as great lunch spot. I've never been here for dinner.  The service is good, and always welcomed with a smile.  The fried rice is amazing! I've never had complaint.  I recommend if you live in the area."}
{"text":"OMG!! As a lover of PHO, a friend recommended this place and it is so far my favorite. My girlfriend and I go there 2 to 3 times a week. I have nothing much to say I mean it's just phenomenal. It honeslty just doesnt get better than this. the best PHO in Phoenix!!!!"}
{"text":"I got my pho and the noodles were still hard. The broth is alright, I've had better. They only give you one cheap napkin for your whole meal, which is pretty dumb because people tend to get runny noses when eating their pho."}
{"text":"Great spot! Come here often on work lunch breaks. Typically quick with getting your food out, open seating, and great menu. I typically get the #4, #10 & #21. The Pho bowls are amazing and do have a small option if the large is too big."}
{"text":"I had the vegetable pho. Vibrant broth, fresh veggies but a tad light on noodles. Service was prompt and didn't hover about. I would return."}
{"text":"I love the flavor of their food! I always get the shrimp spring rolls as an appetizer and the shrimp and noodle soup. The staff isn't the most friendly but they are always quick to take your order and refill any drinks. My only complaint is that the soup could be a little hotter. By the time I'm half way done eating it is cold."}
{"text":"This place I believe has one of the best bun bo hue in the east valley  thanks to my friend for introducing me to this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place ! Definitely will be back ! This is the second pho place I've tried in Tempe since I live on the west side of town and it's the best. Better the unphogettable! Highly recommend to anyone  Very friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Went here after reading Doug T. review.  We had both fried egg rolls and beef spring rolls to start, and we all ordered Pho.  Place looks good and clean, food was very good, even our kids are everything.  On the way out my 8-yr old said \"dad, you should give them 4 stars because we had to wait a lot for our food and get up and ask for water\".  Future Yelper right there.  He is spot on.  Will def be back for the Pho!"}
{"text":"On 12/28/15 my girlfriend and I had lunch here.  It was very good and I will upload a photo later.   We ordered Number 35 combination with grilled pork, chicken, shrimp, egg roll and egg omelet. We also ordered steamed banana cake for dessert.   The food was fresh, well prepared and presented well. It tasted great. Service was excellent and friendly.  The restaurant was clean, organized and popular but not too noisy.  A great place for Thai and Vietnamese food. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Been there twice and I've only had the pho with chicken and its freaking delicious, great portion too and I always get the crispy egg rolls as appetizer. The service has always Ben great and quick."}
{"text":"I am only giving this place 3 stars because the service is awful. The owner or manager (not sure which he is) is so rude. He never smiles. The food is pretty good, but I don't suggest going unless you don't care about bad service."}
{"text":". Foods was right on point, service was excellent, ambiance was superb. For a small family restaurant, the inside was well put together, having a pleasant waterfall and neat table seating. To start off, we had the beef spring rolls and shrimp spring rolls, both came with sauce and were perfect in size. Our main entrees were combination pho', chicken fried rice and chicken pad thai. My group and I enjoyed each of the entrées. The staff was always around to refill our waters and made sure we were happy with the food and service. Price was average total cost was  $36. I will definitely go back and would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING FOOD with expensive price. The slice of beef for Pho is supposed to be thin and tasty, instead it's CHEWY and thick and very smelly. My bowl of Pho was so nasty that I could not barely have the 3rd bite and left the whole bowl untouched. I'd not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Pricy and yucky food!!!"}
{"text":"One of the better Pho restaurants. Now I haven't tried them all but from the ones I have tried, this place is actually decent. I really don't eat pho out because I'm Vietnamese and I prefer home cooked versions but when my mom is too busy, this place can do the trick and curb the craving.   Actually most of the food I've tried here is really good. The bun bo que is bomb and they don't give me fuss when I ask for more limes. The fried chicken with nuoc mam is a little salty but I love salty so it's right up my alley.   My only complaint is the mango salad. I usually don't get those but for some reason as soon as I saw it on the menu, I knew I needed to get it but to my surprise when I got it, there was no mango to be seen. I let the waiter know and he came back out with a small plate of mangoes which mad me very sad. Basically the salad was more of a celery salad than mangoes and I can not stand celery so I don't recommend that unless you love celery.   Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Pho king awesome! The broth is amazing. Layers of flavor. I can't say enough about how good this pho is."}
{"text":"So it's only my first time here. Had the soup and Thai pork rice. I have been looking for good Vietnamese for a long time and this was the best I've ever had. I will definitely go again . Customer service ehhh. But who cares. Not crazy about the brisket so will try something else next time. Maybe meatballs in the soup. Good ambiance."}
{"text":"In a pinch, this place will do, but it's certainly nothing exceptional - pretty run of the mill, super slow service to get a check, and an apethetic staff to say the least. Don't order anything curry - I guess there's a reason you don't generally find curry dishes on a Vietnamese restaurant menu. Just trust me on this, there's some kind of funky spice in there but it's not curry and you won't like it and barely touch it but they won't care and you'll have to pay for it anyway.  The food comes out fast and the pho is adequate, but all things combined do not add up to Pho #1."}
{"text":"For Vietnamese, there are not many good places for pho in the valley. I am glad i found this place. I love Pho and Bun thit nuong here. My husband and I come here every week that the owner remembers our order. she also notes that i don't eat bean sprouts. one time i forgot to ask for no bean sprouts but she remembered."}
{"text":"As always, the food was delicious. I had the pho with shrimp. I really like this dish and it is perfect for a chilly day. My daughter had the vermicelli bowl with grilled pork. She also enjoyed her meal. We also decided to try an appetizer: marinated wings. These wings are delicious and never disappoint, but was hard to enjoy since they came out two minutes before our entrees. As always, service was good but constantly rushed. I felt as I had just started on the appetizer when the waiter was asking if he could take the plate: four of the eight wings still uneaten.  Needless to say, I am finishing this review from home because I felt so pressured to hurry up and eat, pay and leave. Lastly, don't wear a heavy jacket or sweater into Pho Number One. It is as HOT inside as the pho they serve!!!"}
{"text":"First thing I noticed was how clean the restaurant was, which was very welcome given that so many pho restaurants are dirty and grungy.  The service was fast and friendly, prices were reasonable, pho was very good (#21 and 23), however, the serving sizes weren't very big and I ran out of noodles pretty quick.   I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious and just what I needed when fighting a cold. Tasted like they melted down a whole cow in the best way possible."}
{"text":"I am not sure why I haven't rated this place until now. I have been coming here for a couple of years and always enjoy their shrimp spring rolls, Vietnamese iced coffee, and pork vermicelli bowl. I can't speak to the pho as I haven't had it. The portions are good, the food is very delicious, and  the atmosphere is nice. My only minor complaint is that the service is cold, efficient but cold. It doesn't bother me I've come to expect it, if this will be an issue for you than I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, had the Pho steak it was really good. The shrimp spring rolls were awesome with a great sauce. Service could have been more enthusiastic but timely."}
{"text":"Brisket Pho and Chicken Pho are always incredible. Very clean place where I can always enjoy a delicious bowl of steaming, fresh pho."}
{"text":"I have always been very happy with the food ordered, and I want to give them 5 stars because the last time I was in, I accidentally ordered the wrong meal and they insisted on making me the right one as quickly as possible. This is our neighborhood go-to for Thai and Vietnamese and it's great. Would love to have a beer with our dinner someday but the pad thai and beef short ribs are the best in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing pho for the price. The service during the weekday lunch is great."}
{"text":"I have had a lot of Pho in different places. I have had better in the past but I have yet to find a better place here in Phoenix.  I was very happy with the clean environment and friendly staff.  I thought the food was very good and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"I am a regular in pho world..and this place is just.....average. Nothing awesome about this place..especially when there is so much competition in Mesa area."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of different pho in the valley and this spot is hands down my favorite. My wife and I drive way out of our way once or twice a week (no exaggeration) to eat here. The restaurant is clean, contemporary, and all of the food we've ordered has been outstanding. The pho is delicious and the rice plates and vermicelli bowls are amazing as well. The staff are all very Vietnamese and don't speak a lot of English so they don't go out of their way to try and make small talk which is great for me! They do, however, make sure your drinks are all filled and are glad to help if you need something. Two thumbs up. If you're looking for some seriously good pho, PLEASE give pho number one a shot."}
{"text":"The best Pho restaurant in Phoenix. The Pho soup is always delicious and fresh. The pork spring rolls are so good. So far me and my girlfriend have been coming for the past couple of months and we love it! Very friendly waiters and delicious food."}
{"text":"Went to get some Pho at Pho au sen today and was greeted with a Grand opening sign?...... Came in an sat down to the exact same decor but a different menu, they now have thai selections (which the server ensured me was top notch) I was a little hesitant to try a different pho than what I was craving, because I have been disappointed before.  But I said 'fuck it' and ordered the combo pho and charbroiled pork bún with vermicelli.  The menu only stated the combo had brisket, meatball  and sliced round eye. WHAT? no tendon or tripe?! Don't fret, they just left it out of the description. They're in there and still delicious.  The broth was fragrant and rich, noodles and meats were plentiful and bowls were bigger than i remember! Pork bún  was tasty and plentiful with more pork than I used to get at the old place =P  I talked with one of the servers and he told me they bought the business about 4 days ago, and made some improvements to the menu (fresher meats, bigger servings and lower prices) and from now until the 12/20/12 they are offering 20% off your bill.  Stop by and welcome your new go to spot for pho.  Pics and thai review to follow shortly.  cheers :)"}
{"text":"This is a quiet restaurant conveniently located at the southeast corner of Dobson and Baseline in Mesa. I ordered roast pork spring rolls, which were very tasty; this is one item I normally don't find in other Vietnamese restaurants, where shrimp is the standard (and often bland) protein in their spring rolls. I also had the lemongrass grilled beef over rice vermicelli and it was an excellent choice; the umami of the beef was complemented and enhanced nicely by the flavor of lemongrass. The staff is attentive and considering how nicely appointed the place is, I had expected it to be on the pricey side; but it turns out that the food here is just as inexpensive as in other Vietnamese restaurants in the Valley."}
{"text":"Omg!  So good.  My first try at Pho & it was great.  Loved the sauce for the spring rolls too."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Vietnamese food and this is a restaurant that I come back to often. In spite of the fact it's 10 miles out of my way to get here. They have good food, the restaurant is clean and the staff is very polite. If you're looking for a good place that consistently serves good Pho, I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Came here with my brother. I ordered the Thai spicy rice with chicken. My brother ordered beef pho. We both loved it!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. Always nice & clean, great service. The Pho is off the charts good. I always get tofu & vegetables. I've also had their shrimp dishes & mango salad. Definitely my go to Pho."}
{"text":"I was here recently and ordered the beef roll wrapped in betel leaf (bo la nho) I was really excited to try this dish here and compare it to other Vietnamese restaurants that offer it. I have to say I was really disappointed by the size of the beef rolls. I've never seen rolls soooo small and skinny. I understand this is considered an appetizer, but for the price ($8.50), it should have been bigger. Regardless of the price, beef rolls are usually the size of an egg roll, not a q-tip. The picture on their menu reflected this as well. So I thought I was getting the normal size rolls and felt really cheated when the plate came out. As far as the taste, the flavors were good and authentic but I left feeling really dissatisfied and hungry."}
{"text":"Food is great, the portion of Pho is big enough for me to finish, but service is nowhere near friendly. No chatting, no \"hey how are you,\" no \"how is the food,\" and no \"thank you.\" Can you work on this Pho Number One?"}
{"text":"I love this place. Right up the street from my house and really good Pho. I'm not sure what the complaints about the service are all about. I've always had great service and the food come out promptly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"That staff was super impolite to us. When they served us food, just like they want to throw the whole dish in our face. Never come back"}
{"text":"Best Pho place in the valley and I've experienced 3 as of this review. I really can't comment on anything except the Pho cause I've never tried anything else. I come here for one reason and one reason only, lip smacking Pho. Couple of things I really like about this place: 1) Seems to be a family owned / managed establishment, I like that cause they care about the food. 2) big TV screen on the wall that's always tuned into the game I want to watch. As most of you know, Pho comes out super hot and it needs a little time to cool off, so why not catch some of the DiamondBacks game?   Great Pho, decent service, big TV. It's a winner."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get some pho to go. The pho was really good but the people seemed a bit rude and short with me"}
{"text":"I was so so so sad when I wanted to place a to go order for Vegetarian Lemongrass Beef Vermicelli from Pho Ao Sen only to find it was bought out a month ago by Pho Number One.  I barely understood the guy on the phone but wanted to order something as I was starving and hadn't thought of a backup plan!  He said he had some rice noodles with tofu.  It was okay.  I was still hungry when I finished it.  Cost around $7.  I won't be back.  BUT I am so so so sad that I will never have Vegetarian Lemongrass Beef Vermicelli from Pho Ao Sen!  Waaaaahhhhhhh!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is really good here. I have tried everything from the spring rolls to the limeade. Every time the food outs hot and fresh. The service is pretty fast and the staff is okay. Most of the time they are pretty attentive and pretty friendly."}
{"text":"The pho broth is actually one of the best I've had in Arizona. Honestly the atmosphere is horrible. The waitress, who i believe is the owners wife has no people skills. No smile or greeting. She was on her phone the whole time. Just horrible service but the pho was excellent..."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Pho! Also the other dishes they have are fabulous too if you don't care for Pho. We have been to most of the Pho places around the valley and I always go back to this one. The service is always a bit slow, but you just deal with it!"}
{"text":"The service is quick and to the point, food is delicious, and it's clean. I love that you can order Vietnamese and Thai food under one roof! That means I get to drink Thai tea AND have my pho simultaneously! Woohoo! The combo vermicelli bowl was heaven, my pho broth was yummy--I prefer mine with a kick of sriracha & jalapeños. The rice plate is tasty, but maybe a bit small in the serving size (we got it to go). Overall, this place is a for sure thing for authentic Asian cuisine. I order out or eat here pretty often--twice this last week haha!"}
{"text":"Really not impressed with this place after it changed ownership. The new service is absolutely terrible, and the quality of the food has diminished rapidly. The young Asian kids who are always working seem to feel as if you owe them something by being there, and could care less about your time or your dining experience. The pho has somewhat of a greasy undertone to it, which makes it extremely unappetizing. Not impressed."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints and their presentation is fantastic. All of the ingredients are fresh and the place is spotless. I love all of their pho but you should also try the pineapple and Thai fried rice. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Our second time here and it's pho-nominal. Each dish we've ordered is delicious. We've now tried several kinds of pho and a couple of noodle dishes and have loved them all. Portions are large - I had half a bowl of broth and noodle left, but my husband finished his and ate mine. I guess you might want to order an appetizer or extra noodles if you have a hearty appetite. The ingredients and dishes taste fresh and made to order. The only thing we've tried that were just okay are the spring rolls. They were good but nothing special and possibly a frozen product, but I didn't ask. The prices are very fair for what you're getting. The kids also love it and half portions are available if you ask. I definitely agree with the opinions on the waitstaff, but for the most part I think it's more of a language barrier. It's also not a place we go for ambiance, we go to get our Pho on."}
{"text":"Unbelievably slow too slow for lunch maybe dinner will work I stopped in there was not too many people in the restaurant only a few had food everyone look like they we're getting ready to go find some food somewhere else"}
{"text":"Soooo good. Always love any of Poh. This time tried Shrimp stir fry. Best Yet. Fried rice is Excellent. Really fast service. Hot and lots of portions. Number One Place"}
{"text":"Good spot for Pho.  They are quick and delicious.  The place is clean and decor is modern."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time since the change in management.   Food here is over priced like it was before and I would say the food is so so.  My party and I had rice combo plates and spring rolls. The rice plate were really run of the mill avg, nothing special. The sauce for the spring rolls was really loose, no way near a true dipping sauce for a spring roll.  I wouldnt come back here at all... just based on the food.  Our bill for 3 entrées, 3 desserts, and 2 appetizers endeding being close to $55"}
{"text":"Every time I come I get pho, and let me tell you it never disappoints!! This time I also order eggs rolls which were also very good! So happy I only live a few minutes away!!"}
{"text":"This place is Pho Ao Sen with a new name, a menu redesign and less taste. I used to consider Pho Ao Sen my number 2 go to for Pho due to it's quality and proximity to me. Now I probably won't be back. The Pho Tai Chin I had seemed to lack any substantial flavor in the broth, my key to some good pho, and the meat just seemed sub par. It used to be the broth was solid but not great, now it is below the curve.   I wanted them to still be at least decent for those times when for some reason I need some pho when UnPhoGettable (best pho I have had so far) is closed. Now I probably won't be back, with the number of places to get pho expanding this place is getting bumped from my list."}
{"text":"Very bad experience! My coworker gets food from here all the time so today I didn't bring lunch and decided to give it A try. Bad idea! I got the spicy beef pho and it was horrible. It smelled and it tasted like a dead animal. It was 4 orders total and only mine smelled like that. I don't know if it was that particular kind or just my soup but I still feel like throwing up. I had to throw away the whole thing."}
{"text":"The best soup my husband and I have ever tasted. When they closed for a month and half, we tried every single Vietnamese soup restaurants in the valley and we just couldn't find the perfect taste at all. We go there so many that they already know what we want all the time haha!"}
{"text":"Started off really well, not that it ended differently. I made my usually order; shrimp and pork spring rolls with combo pho. The spring rolls were a little sad. One tiny sliver of pork and one shrimp split in half. The second one had even less in it. I hate to say it, but I could have rolled it better. I asked the waiter if that was normal serving and he said yes like I would out of my mind to ask. I would rate the spring rolls 4.5/10. If they were any higher in price the rating would have been lower.  I got pho with meatball, round and slice steak. The flavor was really good. I have no complaints about the pho here, just the disappointment with the spring rolls it really dropped my rating. If I happen to come back I would ask them to double the shrimp and pork just to get a normal amount. I do not know that I will be back. There's lots of places around that area."}
{"text":"While living in LA I was introduced to several different types of Asian cuisine ... Vietnamese & Thai being amongst them.  The best part about this restaurant is that they have both under the same roof!  Some restaurants in this part of town can make one feel a bit weary about actually giving them a shot and trying their food.  Although Pho #1 may not look like much from the outside - it is very nice and extremely clean and well-kept on the inside.  It was a pleasant surprise.  We each tried a few of the shrimp/pork spring rolls, then a few of us tried the pho and one of us went with the chicken fried rice.    Everything we ordered was very fresh tasting ... I wasn't overly impressed by the spring rolls/fried rice ... They seemed pretty average for the most part.  The only service issue we ran into had to do with the language barrier - the person who ordered the chicken fried rice requested that it be made without eggs, since she was allergic, and it had to be sent back to the kitchen twice before it was properly made without eggs. The 3rd time was the charm, yet having the send food back to the kitchen several times is not so charming.   The PHO was AMAZING though - I tried the meatball, brisket, steak pho and there was plenty of meat, the broth was hearty, and it was absolutely delicious - out of all the places in AZ that I have tried pho I would say that this is by far the best ... As I said everything we ordered was \"good\" but the PHO was SUPER!  I will definitely be back and will recommend others to try out the best pho in town! ;)"}
{"text":"I love Pho alot. I even travel far and beyond just to tasted pho's everywhere. This place used to be own by another business. I even remember  it cause the people used to be 5-6 rotating for the shifts, yeah that's how often I used to come here. Then they changed owners and the name of the place. I gave them 2 chances at least to get my fave \"pho\" on the same spot that the former owner had. Unfortunately they did not retained the same flavor. I really tried to give them a fair judgment but when 2 out 2 me and my co-yelper are having the same result, I think it's enough for me to say \" it's way too different, and it's not in a good way\"  As a reference on the old place, I reviewed them with the same criteria. Basically it goes down to taste, authentic flavor, customer service and of course price. Taste was just not there, as orders said no \"wow\" factor at all. Just plain and simply, there's nothing that this place offer in regards to that department. 2nd the authentic flavor, which I may say when you tasted so much PHO you want to have that \"it's different from this place\" taste- there was none here. Nothing made me want to come back except for the fact that the old place had such a food taste and had authenticity.  To add to that me and other yelpers had bad waiting time- :( . Then lastly with the their price, which should be okay if the first 3 was present, it's a bit too pricey for something this bland.  In its fairness it's still a beautiful place to eat if your stranded around the area. Atmosphere is pretty nice- nothing changed from the previous owner. I did however found some PHO places nearby, I don't want to tell their name but yeah 1 of them tasted better.   I hope you guys look at this review and expect what I didn't expected. A bit mediocre on my taste but if your new- pretty sure you can find their flavor still pretty nice. Just not quite for me who have spent some time eating Pho's around the valley."}
{"text":"My buddy showed me this joint, said it was the best around. I have been coming here 2 to 5 times a week since,  The spring rolls are a very good choice for starters, always fresh and tasty, not thrown together like some places!  The pho is great! Very tasty broth and an excellent amount of options to go in with it, from chicken to beef this place is great!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Vietnamese restaurant around the Phoenix area!  The owner is alway attentive as are his staff.    The Pho is tastes and great in every way.  My favorite is the Pad Ki Mao with chicken!  Everyone should eat here once... If they do, they will keep on going there!  Even the bathroom is nice here and clean!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon for pho.  The service was not as quick as it was in the past but the food was great as usual. The pho is always very fresh as are the condiments. It's one of my favorite places for pho in the valley."}
{"text":"Good pho.  This is my to go spot for good pho. I've tried them all in the valley. Clean and get this, friendly...consistently. Good job guys."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Trademark - I'll Be The One)  Imagine what your Pho would bring to me You know that I'm waiting patiently Till you're in my side Bo Bites days; Bo Bites nights Eggrolls is the one I need can't you see You know my belly is crying just for you Fish Sauce I will always add it too To be in my side Bo Bites day and Bo Bites night But I feel my belly is aching without you  Let's go to Pho Number One If you want me here to stay Let's go to Pho Number One To feed me all the way No I'm never gonna leave you You're always on my mind and Pho Number One I'll visit all the time  Pho Number One is a very modern looking Vietnamese restaurant located in Mesa.    Like most Vietnamese restaurants this one supplies plenty of Vietnamese cultural decor, but to my surprise also some modern Southwest art.  It has a couple of television screens playing some odd channel I didn't recognize, but who knows what dwells upon the millions of channels of Direct TV!  Carrying on, my group and I came for dinner.  I went for the Eggrolls to start and the Lemongrass beef Vermicelli noodles.  This is not my usual dish I would order in a place called Pho Number One, but it was freakin' hot out and I need something less soupy hot!  Overall, the eggrolls were perfect to the crunch with pork and vegetables.  The eggrolls were a lot longer than what I'm used to, but very good in my books.  The noodle dish came with beef tender flanks seasoned with a lemongrass sauce and your usual carrots, bean sprouts, and mint.  Not a bad dish at all and presentation wise was quite appealing; I had to add a couple more mint and bean sprouts cause I love mines with a plethora of vegetables!   In the end, the place serves it's purpose.  The Pho according to one of my friends was okay and I'll have to take his word for it until the next time around.  However, if you need a quick Vietnamese cuisine fix; Pho Number One will deliver just fine! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times for lunch after my nails appointment. I normally order chicken or beef curry with Thai tea. Unlike curry from other southeast Asian countries, this curry taste so similar to Japanese curry. Probably type of spice they use must be similar. It's spicy, I normally order with Thai tea to help with spices.  Today I ordered pork rice dish. I always liked pork rice dish from any other Vietnamese restaurant and I was never disappointed with this dish. I like to order fried egg over my rice. They don't normally serve with the egg but they can easily add one at extra cost.  Probably because the first pork rice dish I had in Asia a long time ago had an egg so I always remember fried egg on my rice.  Service is okay. Not really friendly nor attentive. Looking at them remind me some times I spent in Southeast Asia, just quite men, nothing extra.  This restaurant is very clean and I've watched them clean the table. They do very through job cleaning. Decor is very interesting and I like them. Whenever I visited them, they always have soccer on TV, or should I say \"football\" in European way.  I saw several other dishes I wanted to try. I guess I will stop by here again next time I get my nails done."}
{"text":"Great tasting pho and staff is very friendly!!! We came here after having a bad time at pho van near Lee Lee. Hoping for a more friendlier atmosphere and better food, this place delivered. I am glad that the waiter there, whom came from Seattle was very approachable and attentive to everyone as best he could. We had pho with chicken, bun no hue and pho with meatballs. All were flavorful! Only thing I'd say is that if the additional items are going to cost $2 add more than 3 pieces please!!! Will be going back."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance. Clean restaurant. Good vibe when you walk in. Kinda went downhill after that first impression.   Food was okay actually. My boyfriend had their number 29 which was Hot and Spicy Pork Feet, he wanted to add Shrimps to it as well. He said it was just okay. Nothing spectacular that he has to go back for more, nothing bad to stay away from. I had their number 30 - Bun Rieu. I love Bun Rieu. The server condescendingly asked me \"The one with the shrimp meatball? Are you sure??\" I was thinking Do I need to be Vietnamese to be \"sure\" that I wanted the number 30?!  Anyway food arrived after 10 minutes, we were starving. The bowls were decently sized and flavored. I wish i didn't order spring rolls beforehand since my #30 filled me up in a snap. My Bun Rieu was good but Hue for me has still better flavor and better homemade shrimp balls. Though pho number one's Bun Rieu doesn't have pork ribs which I liked. After a few minutes, another server asked with a serious face \"Everything okay?!\" I don't know if he wanted to start a fight or was just not in the mood to serve.   For To Go, i ordered number 28 which is the Pho Combination and it was just okay as well.   All in all, sure i'll be back. Mostly for To Go. There are just so many pho restaurants out there with much more outstanding service that I just might not be back soon enough at this place. Definitely not the number one Pho place contradictory to their name."}
{"text":"Called in to ask for hours and they said something i couldn't hear so I asked politely for them to repeat and they hung up on me ... really ? What kinda of customer service is that."}
{"text":"LOVED this place, came with my niece, her boyfriend my sister and guy friend. I started off with the vegetarian egg rolls and YUM! The waiters were both very nice and attentive to quick service. To drink I got the coconut drink that LITERALLY comes in a coconut, a little sweet but quite delish. My sister got the Chai coconut drink and it was a little different taste than I'm used to but very creamy and kind of a spicy finish. For entree we all got #21 which is the traditional pho with steak- they have all the fix-ins as well on the side to add in, with sauce choices to add in- hoisen, Siracha, chili paste and soy sauce...  All the ingredients were top quality and very fresh and I will definitely be back for more! To top it off - total bill was $44 and we had 5 people eat  so if you love pho this is definitely a place id recommend coming!"}
{"text":"Got the vegetarian pho with extra noodles. Huge delicious serving! I will return for more! Gave 4 out of 5 stars because service could be friendlier."}
{"text":"It definitely hit the spot. I haven't been in the mood for Pho ever since my favorite spot changed ownership (and recipes). It was a rather wet day and the beau was feeling under the weather. Ever since I turned him on to the dish he has obtained the same craving for it that I used to have.   So, well decided to find a place sort of close to home. I ordered the veggie Pho which I know isn't really traditional but I love me some veggies. This was certainly one of the better veggie pho that I have had. The vegetables were crisp and the broth was hot. The Beau enjoyed his bowl as well. I presume when the season is right or the craving sets in, we will be by to try it again."}
{"text":"WARNING TO VEGETARIANS: Although they have a vegetarian section, not all, if any, of the dishes are actually vegetarian. They serve sauces with these dishes, such as fish sauce, that are not vegetarian. I did not give them a one star, because their food is good, but it is really frustrating when restaurants claim their dishes are vegetarian when they are not. It is dishonest and disrespectful of their customers.  Also, customer service is so-so."}
{"text":"The \"test\" for me of great Pho is when you get to the bottom of the bowl and you regret you areat the end, no matter how stuffed you are. That was the way I fet on each venture (there were many!) to Pho Ao Sen, which ofrmerly occupied this space.  That is NOT the case with this \"Replacement\" for Pho Ao Sen, of which I said the following in my Review.            The Pho was \"ambrosia.\" Very aromatic, nice amount of meat and delicious!               Not only am I ranking it #2 and only slightly behind Dragonfly, it is by far the            best looking and best appointed Restaurant of any of the Pho Joints I have            seen. Also, it is run by a gorgeous Vietnamese young lady who does ALL of the            cooking and is usually there to greet you! GREAT, I mean GREAT Springrolls            complete or start this trip to \"Pho Heaven!\" - Best Springrolls in Phoenix!  Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the New \"Replacement.\" Don't get me wrong, NOT bad Pho, just NOT what had been in this location. It is still a beautiful Restaurant and the Pho is okay, but would NOT be rated among my \"Top 5.\"   Also unfortunate that the unique \"Best Springrolls in Phoenix\" are no more and the new ones are quite usual. Such a shame to lose at least the second best bowl of Pho in Phoenix (I have been to most!).  If you live close, the Pho Number One bowl is fairly priced and the waiters are very nice. The Resteraunt is still quite lovely and charming. Just NOT among the best Pho around!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Pho place in the valley. My husband and I used to eat here at least once a week until we moved out to Gilbert. Now we go whenever we are in the area.   The ingredients are fresh. The broth has the BEST flavor. Great portion sizes, and you can't beat the price! The restaurant is always exceptionally clean and the staff is friendly and quick. You definitely won't be disappointed with this restaurant and I would be surprised if you don't get totally hooked like I did.  And if you're not into Pho, their Pad Thai is really good too and I swear they have the best Fried Rice I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Food: broth flavor was just okay. basil and sprouts were fresh. But Not as much vermicelli as I've seen at other establishments   Prices: Appropriate for pho  Atmosphere: Very clean, calm, elegant, and tastefully decorated. Not what I was expecting looking from the outside.   Service: Quick"}
{"text":"Best Pho I've had in Arizona, hands down. Not only is the restaurant extremely clean it is also quiet and the decor is very nice and up to date. The employees are quick to refill your beverage and check on you as well as thanking every single customer as they leave. The service is A++ I will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's so cute on the inside and very well decorated. The food is amazing and the staff here are so friendly!! This is definitely my favorite place to get pho in the area."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my go to spots for pho in AZ. We usually come here on Sundays after basketball. The customer service is good. They are very soft spoken peeps, but they do take care of you.   I usually order the fried shrimp appetizer and pho that is with rare beef and meatballs. Can't go wrong really because its so good. The place is pretty clean and has a laid back vibe to it which is always nice when you are eating lol."}
{"text":"Best Pho in Mesa! The chicken and steak noodle soups and both are amazing! The spring rolls are also yummy but next time I might ask for no mint or easy mint... It can be too much and overpowering. The staff isn't overly friendly like previous reviews but they are not rude in any way. Prices are super cheap and you can even get 2 meals from one soup! Great place to eat in OR take out! Don't forget to print your coupons on their site before dining in!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Why didn't I eat here sooner??? Great fresh flavors and all of my favorite dishes...VIETNAMESE AND THAI. It also has a very relaxing atmosphere. Can't wait to come back and eat here again!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I probably eat here ever week. They are a great balance of delicious and affordable. My husband always gets the Pho and highly recommends it and I always get the pork vermicelli bowl.  We've tried a few other Vietnamese places in the area and this one is our favorite."}
{"text":"7 of us came for lunch.  We were seated quickly. I ordered a beautiful bowl of bun, vermicelli noodles with shrimp.  The shrimp was charbroiled and very tasty. All of the ingredients in the noodles were  fresh.  The beans sprouts crunched in your mouth as you bit into them. Service was quick and wait staff was pleasant. Prices are moderate. By the time we left it was very crowded."}
{"text":"Favorite, 'go to' Pho restaurant. I have never been disappointed. Favorites are the Veggie Pho and Pineapple Fried Rice."}
{"text":"I tried something new! I liked most of it! It was cool to add what ever we wanted to this noodle soup. The broth was tasty! I ordered the steak and meatball soup. I wish I had just ordered the steak. The meatball slices in mine tasted spoungy and a little weird. It might be how they are supposed to taste but it's not my thing. I slurped up this soup and all of the steak and just left behind the meatball slices. I will return! Delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I come in here pretty often and I've never had a bad meal.  The environment is pleasant and the service is pretty good.  Food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Just tried Pho for the first time here, and I'm obsessed. First we started with the Shrimp & Pork Spring Roll, which came with an awesome peanut sauce for dipping. Then moved onto the Pho Tai for our meal. Everything was out so quickly and tasted amazing and fresh. Like the other reviews I've seen on Yelp, the service here is not as friendly as I'd hoped, but I think the food makes up for their very quiet/unpersonable demeanors. The service isn't bad I just think it's different.... I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The prices are alright, and I like having a Vietnamese place so close to home. But the quality of the food seems like it's slipping and the service is distinctly unfriendly. The last few times I've been here, the greens that come with their pho were dry and almost wilted. I think it's time to start making a longer drive.  On the plus side, the water feature on the wall is still pretty!"}
{"text":"I have tried many pho places in the valley this place isn't that special compare to Vietnam kitchen on Warner and Arizona or unphogettable or Nhat  Their spicy noodle soup bun bo hue so salty and strong smell of shrimp paste rather than lemon grass  Mostly the service is terrible , waitress just came and place the menu on the table no greetings or smile or come and check on us Will never come back here"}
{"text":"A great place to get your pho fix at a decent price. Inside dinning area is nice and very clean. Spring rolls are amazing!"}
{"text":"It's so delicious! Friendly and fast service. Their limeade was everything! Soooooo good"}
{"text":"Im viet and their pho is probably one of the better pho restautants in the valley in terms of the flavor in the bowl. I really enjoyed the broth and the meat was quite easy to swallow. Unfortunately, like many other viet restaurants, they seem to have caught the disease of shoddy service due to hiring waiters and waittresses (usually family) that dont really care to interact with their customers. Also, their portion sizes are definitely much smaller than that of other pho restaurants of similar price. Nevertheless, if you're craving some viet noodles, this is a place you should check out."}
{"text":"Driving by this place, I expected it to be some little hole in the wall, but I was wrong.  Right when I walked it, I noticed how high end it looked, and I certainly didn't expect there to be table service.  However, big downside here, there was either no AC or it wasn't turned on.  Hey, I'm eating hot soup in May in AZ, I'd like to be a little more comfortable.    I'm pretty new to Thai and  Vietnamese food, but I decided to go all in and order the #30, Bun Rieu. I liked the shrimp meatballs, the broth took on the flavor of the herbs that was added to it, and it filled me up, but the tofu seemed a little tough and had a leathery skin. I may have scored this place lower, but the Spring Rolls saved the day.  Extremely fresh and served with a slightly spicy peanut sauce, they were amazing.  If anything, Pho Number One helped me get a taste of Pho, but I think I'll try a few others before I go back."}
{"text":"Tasted decent! Not my fave Vietnamese restaurant in the area, but certainly not bad.  Servers weren't the friendliest, but hey it's probably been a long day!  Probably wouldn't come here again, due to the influx of other Vietnamese restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"I've been to maaaaaaaaany pho places, because I'm ADDICTED. I have to say, this place is the best. The pho tai is amazing and the spring rolls are awesome! Best peanut sauce around. The prices are low and the atmosphere of the restaurant is way better than other pho joints around. They are closed for a month right now to go on family vacation and I'm going through serious withdrawals"}
{"text":"Most definitely PHO NUMBER ONE! We got number 28, the pho was delicious,  the meat exquisite,  the broth and portions exceptional.  This will be my \"go to \" place from now on.  I'm so happy too have found such a gem!"}
{"text":"I stopped with a friend for lunch and the food was absolutely amazing! I had spicy chicken curry and he had the veggie rice noodle soup. Large portions and sweet service. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"The  service is getting worse. I think the owner wife is the waitress and she's so unfriendly. I try to over look it because I shouldn't judge (she may have a bad day) but no! She is always like that! It'sa shame because I will always tip people and I feel robbed when i tipped her. She doesn't deserve it.  The food is also getting worse. I think they changed the chief or cut back on quality ingredients,  because the noodles are so little and the broths like pho, bun etc were so meh. I'm really disappointed.  Save your money or take your family to a different place.  I do NOT recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had dinner here this evening and the enthusiasm of the staff was a hair above the excitement at a Mortuary. I was told this place was under new management and the food was better than my previous visit. I order spring rolls with shrimp and pho #26 (rare flank steak and beef meatballs). The broth was ok, the bowl was a good size yet they lack the various greens to compliment my broth...bean sprouts, 2 limes and a few thai basil leaves, really? I had better pho for $7.50 and for 2 shrimp spring rolls at $3.50,  they could have done way better preparing the accompany sauce. Perhaps it's marketed for Americans without a strong desire to try authentic Vietnamese dishes or just a convenient location for people to eat pho. Either way, not that great before and still not great now irregardless of new management."}
{"text":"Great service & friendly staff members! Not the best pho I've ever had, but tasty nonetheless!"}
{"text":"This is my go to pho restaurant. Great fast service and one of the best pho restaurants in the area. I have tried a lot."}
{"text":"Favorite place to go for Pho. It appears to be the neighborhoods favorite spot too because it's been quite busy lately. The broth is what it's all about for me and most pho lovers and this spot delivers! I have yet to explore the rest of the menu (they have tons of other classic Asian dishes) because the phos are just too good. To top it all off, the service is quick and the prices very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Great food, good prices!  I'll be back.   I especially loved the Vietnamese coffee drink."}
{"text":"If you've never tried Pho, I don't recommend anywhere else for your first time!! I honestly been coming here for years at their Pho never fails me. Being Vietnamese, I'm pretty picky about my Pho. (Although nothing beats California, this is my go-to place). I REFUSE to go to any other place for Pho, nothing beats the taste of their broth here.   I order their Pho Chin Bo Vien all the time and switch it up with their Thai food. Although it's not actually Thai, there's a Vietnamese twist to it that I can't resist. I find it delicious but my mom doesn't think it's all great. Subjective I guess! They use Pho noodles for their Pad Thai and usually go onion + bean sprout heavy so ask for less if that bugs you. It's almost sour like from the paste (and probably all the lime I add to be honest) but I keep coming back for more! I just ordered a new dish I haven't tried but I'll update on that some other time.  (UPDATE: Ordered the Pad Kee Mau (Drunken Noodle) and they didn't skimp on any ingredient, wow. Not as good as an official Thai cuisine restaurant but gets the craving settled!)   Please try their Pho here. I can't stress it enough. My friends have tried Pho elsewhere and just had bad experiences and I really tell everyone to try it here. I actually always ask for to-go boxes to take home the broth to add rice to it or anything else as leftovers because it's that good. (It's not necessary to drink all the soup in your broth. It's not the norm but I can't get over how tasty it is!)  The service however is like 3/5. They usually look like they don't wanna work and never smile. They are still kind of polite though. Food makes up for it, haha."}
{"text":"Where do I start, this is the first time here for lunch. The restaurant was very clean, decor was very nice, service was very good, but the food was horrible.   We started off with the #1, Goi Cuon Tom Thit (Shrimp and Pork Spring Rolls) which had no taste not even the peanut dipping sauce that accompanied them, the rice skin was tuff and chewy. We then had #21, Pho Tai (Noodle Soup w/Eye Round Steak). The bowl came out piping hot which I loved, but the broth was dark and GREASY, there was 3 tiny tiny pieces of Eye Round Steak. There was absolutely no taste in the broth. In addition, #25, Pho Tai Chin Nac was exactly the same.  I love taking photos of my food and posting. Unfortunately I couldn't, as ALL the dishes looked so unappealing visually.   Sorry to say, with all the competition around, I will not be coming here again, and just a tiny bit of advise, get rid of the Emoji on the front of the menu, it does not match with the feel of the restaurant decor inside."}
{"text":"The place was great, but a few things we where rushed and hovered over the entire time. We where also being watched as we ate our meal which was uncomfortable. Also they don't take America Express and there isn't any sign that says they don't take them. So if you have AMX good luck they don't take it."}
{"text":"This place is one of the better Vietnamese options in the valley. Pho and vermicelli are excellent - the pho broth is a little sweeter than usual, but very tasty. I don't understand why this place isn't rated higher."}
{"text":"New owners and used to go by Pho Ao Sen. Interior is the same, staff is different and in my opinion not as friendly. Pho broth is a step down from before and not nearly as flavorful. I think these guys are trying to do to much by offering Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese and Vegetarian. Get Vietnamese right first, then maybe try and expand your menu."}
{"text":"The pho is delish, the bun is my fave though. I only give this a 4 star because their fresh rolls could be better, I love a good fresh roll. Quick and attentive staff. Super tasty and prices are awesome!"}
{"text":"Excellent pho. Very flavorful. Comes with Thai basil as well as the usual sides. Great service  Also very good friend appetizers."}
{"text":"One of the top 3 spots in AZ for authentic Vietnamese food. My favorite dish is the Beef Pho soup served with plate of fresh herbs--(cilantro, basil, bean sprouts & limes) I have them add broccoli to my soup too! Try the shrimp rolls in rice wraps (minus the pork) and dip in peanut sauce. You'll be back for more! Classy environment & service."}
{"text":"I heart the pho here. Love it when im sick or need the pho neighborhood fix. Other wonderful items that boast glory. Comes with the pho fixins. I should probably eat more things here but I cant stop ordering the same thing."}
{"text":"This is a place that is a family favorite but just so happens to be my first time. From the outside it just doesn't look appealing at all. Small place in a big shopping center but when we walked in I was very surprised. Spacious. Loved the dark wooded furniture with the stone walls. Very modern looking.   We started out with the Shrimp & Pork spring rolls. Two to an order. Not cut in half but had to cut ourselves. Very fresh. Really good. The Shrimp with the pork were so good and then the peanut dipping sauce. Outstanding. We also had the fried ground pork dumplings. I could tell these were fresh. Little hot in temperature. Man we're these good. Nice bite sized dumplings. Love the sweet & sour dipping sauce. Just brought these dumping over the top.   I ordered the steamed rice with grilled pork. The pork was sliced thin and marinated. Really really good. Came with a nice portion of white rice and a few slices cucumber and tomatoes. Really good dish and really enjoyed it.   Pretty funny but the rest of my family ordered the combination vermicelli bowl which had grilled pork, beef, shrimp, and an egg roll. This was a pretty big bowl. Need a pretty big appetite for this. I was able to get a few bites from my wife's bowl and it was really good. Loved the uncooked bean sprouts and fresh mint leaves. Everything was very fresh and the Shrimp was grilled perfectly. Not too dry but really good.   I'm thinking that this is a family owned business and love supporting mom & pop shops.   The service was pretty good. They took our order but that's about it. Not too friendly but all business. I have no problem with that. Food quality is important. They also brought our water cups out really quickly and made sure our water cups were always filled. So pretty good service.  I love Vietnamese food. Love the freshness of their food. The ambiance is not bad but the food is outstanding. No wonder this is a favorite of my family. Will mostly likely be back. Enjoy."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying pho, and I must say it's amazing! I love the peaceful atmosphere as well. The service is good . I don't expect to have a full conversation with my waiters . Just come in , sit, and then eat peacefully . Love it!"}
{"text":"This is my go to pho place. Food is good and restaurant is clean. Service is decent too."}
{"text":"Another typical, strip mall Vietnamese restaurant that has the benefit of being within a mile of my house. This is nicer inside than some, and prices run about average.  For a change I skipped the Pho and went for Saigon Chow Mien. The noodles were nice and crispy, thicker than what I have experienced from the Chinese version, but the broth was so buried at the bottom that I crunched through a lot of noodles to get to the good stuff. I like to huge amount of noodles, but wish they would add more broth. My niece had grilled pork on rice, substituting white rice for fried rice and loved it.   The service was pretty good, friendly enough.  I'd say this place sits on the border of three and four stars. Given its proximity, I will surely try it again and bump it up if warranted."}
{"text":"They serve up decent pho but service is always lacking. They never smile and not very attentive."}
{"text":"This is the very best PHO in all of greater PHX.  I have eat n PHO at 18 different Vietnamese resturants.  This is by far the best.  Killer!  I eat here now every week."}
{"text":"My mom and I had pho here and it was pretty good considering all the other Vietnamese restaurants we've been to.. We also ate the shrimp egg roll it was also really good! And the service was good too! There's a next time for this place!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The service is very quick.  I usually order extra bean sprouts to go with the pho. We have noticed that they seem to put more meat in their pho than a lot of other local places, and its really cheap if you want them to add in more. We usually just get the lean rare steak or chicken pho, so I am not sure about much stuff is in any of their other options, but I would imagine that it is on par with the things we have ordered.The spring rolls are also delicious.  The staff is always really friendly, and the restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for Pho and Pad See Ew! The Pho is delicious, the broth has a bold taste that hits your taste buds. Don't forget to ask for sauté if you like spicy food! It makes it take 2x times better.  The Pad See Ew is my favorite dish there. I get it extra spicy! It always hits the spot. My fiancé orders a large bowl of pho and I order Pad See Ew then we get to share our 2 favorite dishes..   The two workers that are always there are really friendly. I believe it is a family owned restaurant. They are always happy to see us come in and eat!"}
{"text":"Have been coming to this place for about five years.  It is definitely the best pho restaurant in the valley, having tried about five different pho restaurants. The number 29 is my usual if you're looking for something more advanced. It's spicy and has thicker noodles, garnished with mint. Best hangover cure ever!"}
{"text":"I used to hit this spot for my pho cravings since its super convienent to mi casa. It has now been taken over and things have changed but not for the better. i went for the Pad Thai since it is usually a good test for me to determine if i will be back again. It was ok...nothing that knocked me off my feet which of course saddened my Thai loving heart.  Pho Ao Sen, I'm not sure what happened but i Miss you and wish you didn't leave."}
{"text":"I've only been to one other pho restaurant before and this was just as good as the first time! You could tell the ingredients were fresh and everything had good flavor. We shared the egg roll appetizer and for the entrees I got the chicken pho and my fiancé got a shrimp noodle dish and we really liked both! The decor was modern and place was clean. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"On a recent visit, decided to try \"Best Pho\" around, and indeed it was.  Unassuming/strip shopping center, but there it is, and what a nice surprise.  Nicely decorated inside, water feature on stacked stone wall, even tasteful artificial flower arrangements!  We had our favorite vermicelli bowl - pork and shrimp (I skipped on the beef/combo, but now wish I had gotten that too)  The pork was tasty, and NOT laced with fat, the shrimp were grilled perfectly - yes grilled, not just cooked and thrown in the bowl.  Freshest ingredients, and tasty broth made this Pho Comfort Food Heaven.  The restaurant is clean, and the staff are all accommodating without being intrusive."}
{"text":"Good clean broth, ordered the shrimp Pho and shrimp eggrolls. First time here  ..enjoyed will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Refused to take my Doubletake App offer claiming they don't put any advert after I show them the app including the certificate number 589692-805-044.   The food was mediocre at best but the worst of all being baited and switched thus ruined the restaurant experience even after pleading my case three times with the server.  Will not return for principles of bad business practices and I also have a feeling that I am NOT the first.   He told me that he would only accept coupon on their website.  I was pretty disgusted with the experience and realized that he might be the owner so I my feeling is that my argument will go nowhere.  Will issue an warning to all of you as well as DoubleTake App (Gannon Corporation) and do a complete investigation and a follow up on the story.  I will let you know the outcome but meanwhile the stories continues."}
{"text":"Did you know that Vietnamese people consume the largest number of instant noodle in Asia, even more than Japan - the home country of this processed food?  Now you know.  I'm sitting here, nearly midnight, eating my cold Chicken Pad Thai leftovers.  Judge me if you will but I'm gonna pretend I'm doing this for research --- I do it for Yelp!  So while the company name clearly proves that this is a Vietnamese restaurant, they also serve Thai and Chinese dishes.  Between the two of us, we ordered the #1 Shrimp & Pork Spring Rolls, $3.75; #7 Vietnamese Crispy Egg Rolls, $3.50; #28 Combination Rice Noodle Soup (Thinly sliced rare steak, well-done brisket, and meatballs), $7.99; and #64 Chicken Pad Thai (Vietnamese flavors, not Thai style), $8.50.  First off, appetizers!  So the Spring Rolls and the Egg Rolls came out at the same time.  They were longer and super slender compared to other places I've been to.  I love me some Spring Rolls so I grabbed one right away.  It was decent, tasting mainly of mint.  The Egg Rolls were definitely better between the two, being super savory with the sweetened fish sauce.   I stopped in for pho but seeing Pad Thai on the menu made me crave it.  Plus it's not quite \"hot soup weather\" in my book.  When it came out, I was pretty surprised.  Firstly, the noodles were more of the vermicelli noodles they used in pho versus the flatter fatter noodles accustomed to Pad Thai.  I mean, it's all rice noodles in the end so I didn't mind.  They also added pickled daikon which I found amazing.  The flavor overall herald more to Vietnamese style cuisine than Thai which some might find disappointing but I liked it.  And considering this place is blatantly more Vietnamese than Thai, what can you really expect?  The Korean ladies next to ask inquired about my dish and one of them ended up ordering some Shrimp Pad Thai herself.  The pho we ordered was decent.  The broth was very clean tasting.  A generous of noodles was stacked inside the bowl and at the price you're paying, it better be filling and it was.  Are we impressed?  Meh.  It's a clean restaurant in a sleepy little strip plaza.  Pho Number One proved to be busy.  The servers aren't a talkative bunch but they fill up your drinks and brings you whatever you request."}
{"text":"Excellent preparation / preparation of the food.  Especially the Pho and grilled shrimp or beef! Always fresh and tasty veggies to go along with the fast service. Family owned and operated with 2 generations of cooks   Gets busy after 8 on weekends but worth the small wait.   Tasty chua desserts too !"}
{"text":"I've never had a food experience here that made me want to come back (and I really only come back because it's close to home and very convenient). Their broth isn't very flavorful, and the chicken pho ends up tasting like chicken noodle soup out of a can. Khai Hoan (Apache and McClintock) has much better pho!"}
{"text":"I would not call this the number place for Pho, as I have had some better ones.  It is unfortunate that some of the food dishes had some hair.  It made for a difficult meal as it is.  Other than that, the food didn't quite provide my friend his craving for delicious noodle.  He says it lacked the wow factor he was hoping for.  Maybe we came on a bad day, but we expected better based on the its current review status."}
{"text":"It really is number 1. I don't know what else to say! I come here almost exclusively for pho. Delish!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad to give a low rating but the service is horrible consistently. This was my 3rd visit and exactly the same every time. When customers walk in it's \"Sit anywhere you want.\" Then you try to sit at the high top bar. \"No that's for takeout\" very rude. The server is playing on his phone. It's impatient with customers and slams the food down on the tables.   I like the pho. It's a little sweet but great with a touch of lime. Unfortunately 3 strikes and you're out. We won't be back."}
