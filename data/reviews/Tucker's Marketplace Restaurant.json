{"text":"The lunch is an OK value. The hot dishes are OK but sometimes awful. The big draw is the hamburger station. Their burgers & fries are quite good. The problem is that this location is much worse than their others. The food is identical, but they don't cook or season things right here. Better staff and new management mighit help. Dinner is bad value. Holiday pricing is insane and they get rid of the best part, the hamburger station, so why bother going at all?"}
{"text":"went 2day. everything was very good. roast beef - rare and medium offered. teriyaki chicken amazing. burgers amazing, quiche amazing. soups were popular everyone kept eating to the bottom of the cauldron. salads fresh - favourite were the beets and sesame noodle salad. hot items tasty - sweet sour fish, mussels, turkey pie, orange chicken. desserts - flan amazing. all for 9.99 lunch can't beat this deal !!"}
{"text":"Food is good but way overpriced for what is served. There is no BBQ steak or ribs, just chicken legs. Yes there are dozens of salads but these do not justify the price. If the American chain restaurants ryans or golden coral ($12 for dinner with unlimited BBQ steak included) opened here, tuckers       Would have a hard time competing on price and selection."}
{"text":"I think this may be my most favourite buffet - I think Mandarin is overrated and probably because I'm Chinese and don't find their food that special. Anyway, I love the white food here at Tuckers though (I call western food white food sometimes, and this is a white buffet).   I went here for my first time after a few years ago after my friend told me about it and have gone back several times. Before that, I've been to Town & Country near the Guvernment for a while until they closed a few years ago - I find Tuckers' food is better than Town's. I wish there were more white buffets out there so I can compare this to something.   They have a good selection of food including salads, soup, pasta, sauteed meats and veggies, baked chickem, roast beef, free off the grill hamburgers, ice cream just to name a few.   The only thing I'd say they have to work on or do something else that's better is their ethnic food imitation - their chow mein and butter chicken. Nice try but quite right and needs improvement.    So the ervice is standard and good, food is quite good, and the other good thing is the value/price. Its seriously really good value - I usually just go there for their $10 lunches - awesome. Also, I love their free birthday meals - I went there once for it."}
{"text":"This is (was?) a birthday staple for my family, as they offer free meal on your birthday special.  The last time we went here was in Sept 2010, and then again yestrerday (April 21).   The first thin i noticed was the food selecttion has begun to dwindle. The food quality is good, (warm/cold as appropriate nice flavors). But there just doesn't seem to be as much choice anymore.  Also, while not 100% under control of the restaurant. .the area we were seated seemed to be straight out of the Hills have Eyes.  the other guests around me and my wife were loud, rude, obnoxious. Thier kids were running around (and more than half of the people were \"not eating, just visiting\" for more than 45 minutes.  We actually left after watching one of the \"guests\" taste test food at the buffet.. by sticking her fingers in it and then licking them. into multiple dishes. We told the waiter, but paid and left at that point. NOT GOOD.   The interior is very nice and classy, but if they let the clientelle run the show like this.. it's going to decline fast...."}
{"text":"I really like going here because they have a lot of vegetarian options for me and a lot of meat for pretty much everyone I eat with.  The only downside is the dessert, it hasn't changed in years and it's really boring."}
{"text":"The food set up is spacious and is in the center of the floor plan.  There's plenty of room to walk around.  The manager and the staff are incredibly nice, and of course the food is incredible and diverse.  Excellent for brunch, but I wished they did pancakes because they are my favorite.  Ever since I relocated, I really miss this place."}
{"text":"CLOSED Just a note that Tuckers is gone, and has been replaced with Smith Bros. a steak place. http://www.yelp.ca/biz/smith-bros-toronto We used to go to Tuckers usually when someone had a birthday and always came away satisfied."}
{"text":"We always really enjoyed Tuckers. Driving by the 880 Warden site today, we see it's all empty. Does anyone know if they have moved, or just closed up the Scarboro location? No info on their website, (it still directs people to that location)."}
{"text":"As buffets go, this was better than usual. The staff was genuinely helpful and polite, and the food was pretty good. We went for brunch, but there was plenty of variety. The salad bar was fresh and the carved meat nicely done. There were custom-order pancakes and omelets (with many more ingredients that I would have expected), as well as a fajita station. The prices were very reasonable too - $5 for a 5-year-old, up to $17 for the adults. We'll go back."}
{"text":"I'm actually angry at myself for stepping back into a Tuckers Marketplace.  I remember frequenting Tuckers on a few occasions as a cash strapped student during my days in Ottawa, and I can state with certainty that nothing has changed and this is unfortunate for both my finances and the quality of Tuckers.   I always perk up a bit when the prospect of an all-you-can -eat buffet looms on the foreseeable horizon.  There's an extra bounce in my step, and pre-buffet endorphins propel me through the mundane existence that has come to be my life.  I even have a buffet day ritual that I haven't deviated from since about the age of sixteen when I first discovered the Mandarin and later Frankie Tomatoes, but these veritable giants of the buffet world deserve mention later.  Yet I will briefly touch on my buffet day ritual here, because I think everyone should have one and I do hold considerable experience in relation to such matters so here goes.  I start the day with a yogurt smoothie, followed by fruit, usually a banana and an apple for lunch, and maybe a few nutri-grain bars (for best results use strawberry), this modest caloric intake is supplemented with copious amounts of water and quite possibly a bagel with peanut butter before the big event.  However I refrain from drinking water about two hours before game time so that I can ingest my buffet bounty with reckless abandon.    Now on to Tuckers.  The buffet is definitely second rate, but still packs a first rate buffet wallop to the wallet.  The pizza was cold and chalk like, stations weren't replenished with any regularity and the selection just wasn't up to par.  Where's the shrimp???  The food was also eerily reminiscent of what one would find in any high school cafeteria.  I almost had flash backs to our old lunch lady slopping barely edible paste upon my plate-thanks for the trip down memory lane Tuckers.  I like to end with something positive, so I will commend the service.  Our server was incredibly attentive for a buffet server, she offered drinks when needed, cleared plates with almost telepathic ability and was pleasant to boot.  Tuckers also offers a free meal to anyone and everyone on their day of birth ID required.  I think this may now account for the bulk of their business as those with birthdays inevitably have friends and somehow coax and cajole said friends into accompanying them to Tuckers for what some may consider a birthright."}
{"text":"The place was quite good and great back up place for lunch - it's closed now. Subway and fried chicken took over"}
{"text":"How does this place show up when I search Hamburgers? We used to go to the one at Warden and Eglinton all the time, then they moved it and took away most of what was worth eating. We have been to the newish location twice, and wont return, bad selection, overpriced, and packed with screaming kids = us going elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm loving the hot & fresh Yorkshire pudding and roast beef.  I like the salad options and chiili as well.   Really wished buffets wouldn't premake the ceasar salad because it is always limp and nasty  The other hot options don't appeal to me either. Most are covered in tons of sauces.   I agree the desserts area is boring but it sort of helps to keep me away :)  This time we had great service and were lucky enough to sit in a section by ourselfs for most of our meal."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst restaurant I've ever been to. I went once years ago and hated it. I swore I'd never go back. Then 5 years later, my husband decided he wanted to go there for his birthday because you eat free on your birthday. Let's just say you get what you pay for. I have two good things to say about this place.  1) My husband ate for free and my kids ate for $5 and $3. 2) The food was so horrible that I wasn't even slightly tempted to overeat and break my diet. This time I'm putting my foot down. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"I just love it. It's easy, it's fast, it's not too expensive, it's good. You take it out, you eat in, your choice. Salad bar, sandwich, warm food, stir fry, your choice.  I went there a few times for lunch and everybody has been really nice and helpful. Even if there are a lot of people, it moves fast.  Lots of choices, ding it, i wish i had that at home."}
{"text":"Hm, I know, I really wanted to give this place 4 stars, really I did.  It was a great buffet selection with excellent customer service.  The only HUGE down-side was that I got food poisoning and was in pain for two whole days and had to go to the doctor and take antibiotics....  This is the reason why the reviews have stopped for awhile now.  Stay away from the mussels and the sushi bar, that's all I have to say."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Tucker's in Pickering before it shut down. When I first started going, there was a plethora of yummy food choices and I looked forward to the bday visits (you eat for free on your birthday). Slowly, the selection got worse and worse, and we chose a different restaurant to go to, then it shut down.  We decided to give it another shot at this location. Yep, it's still crappy. The selection is SO weak. There was roasted chicken, roast beef, sweet & sour fish....and that was pretty much it as far as \"meat\" went. There was only 2 rows of buffet-ness, and then random stuff scattered around the outskirts, like rice, mashed potatoes, nacho chips, bread.  The food itself was fine, I had no problem with it. It was a little bland, but it's a buffet...so I don't expect much. What I had a problem with was the price. $18.99 for such a chintzy selection? I definitely wouldn't go there unless there was someone celebrating a birthday for the free meal...and even then? I doubt I'll be going back any time soon."}
