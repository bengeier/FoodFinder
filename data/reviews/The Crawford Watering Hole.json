{"text":"I usually like to don my latest thrift shop come up and ride my fixed gear bike here to spend lazy days on the patio where  there's plenty of space - for one - listening to the jazz playing in the background - of my head.  Only the highest quality progressive anti-establishment discourses are inspired in forms of lively debate that I have - with myself - whilst sipping on the cleanest, crispiest example of urban artesian beverage that can be found in this city.  Some may think it's pretentious but I don't care; L'Eau du Robinet never goes out of style!  

Thanks CWH! May you always provide the safe haven that I seek in your urban gentrified bosoms."}
{"text":"I'm usually a big fan of watering holes west of Bathurst. However, the service at this hole was TERRIBLE. I went with my girlfriend last Friday. We ordered two large glasses of ice water. It took 10 minutes for the ice water to make it to us. By that time our ice had melted and the glasses were filled to the brim!!

I WILL NEVER BE BACK."}
{"text":"Pretty amazing water. The staff were super nice and pretty classy. Love the patio and want to head back there another time!"}
{"text":"Great water. They have water stones so you know they're saving their best water for the drinking. I hate when places put ice water into my water and it melts and affects the taste. Also, the owner is kind of hot. If you like tall, dark and handsome men you should check this place out. He's literally always there."}
{"text":"This place was really solid- fresh water and the water stones are such a nice touch. Hope they introduce some cucumber water in the future."}
{"text":"Best water in the city, possibly province. Hands down!

Seriously I've had water on 4 continents and 10 countries, this is definitely best in ontario, if not eastern Canada"}
