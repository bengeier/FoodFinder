{"text":"As the second Persian sandwich shop to open within about 20m of each other, I had to try Baharan Super Sandwich because I figured there must be something about it that the first sandwich shop, Haida Sandwich, lacked.  I mean, either the demand for Persian sandwiches is just too huge to satisfy with one shop only, or the guy who opened the second shop thought he had some competitive advantage.  Judging by the amount of business I see in Haida Sandwich, I think this is a case of the latter...and I think the competitive advantage is LAMB BRAIN and VEAL TONGUE SUPREME!!  But this is only a guess, as I couldn't bring myself to order it. =)  I had the special, a beef bologna sandwich (plus can of pop) for $5.99.  It was okay but I think the bread at Haida was fresher last time I ate there.  The rest of the sandwich tasted about the same and it had my favourite ingredient in it, the hickory sticks.  The rest of the sandwiches on the menu are \"supreme\" and around $10.  They also have Persian hamburgers and hot dogs (which are not quite the same as North American style) but I don't know if I'll go back and try any of those because I like my sandwiches, burgers, and hot dogs either really tasty or really cheap.  They did make my sandwich really really fast at Baharan. No need to call ahead if you're ordering a cold sandwich."}
{"text":"Baharan is the second Persian \"pop\" sandwich joint to open up in North Townway (better known as Meydoon Mohseni or Mohseni Circle). The tiny hole in the wall is meant more for pickup than sitting in, and is a pretty decent choice for late night munchies north of Bloor (+1*) The sandwich options include standards such as burgers and sausage as well as Persian deli style lamb brain& chicken supreme or veal tongue sandwiches.  I have opted for the \"supreme\" burger and sausage so far, and I'd have to say that I've had better. The \"supreme\" translates to a mushroom and cheese sauce that doesn't turn out to be too noticeable. Both the burger and sausage taste different than what you may be used to as they try to emulate the Tehran taste in Toronto, and almost make the grade. There is no particular \"service\" at a pickup counter but as far as that goes, the staff at Baharan are very accommodating and amicable!  Call before pickup to speed up your order."}
