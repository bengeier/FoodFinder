{"text":"So I just walking through the street, didn't even want to eat. I saw a couple , they were just standing at the front of a building and watching through the window. So I decided to check it out and sooner I got that they are watching at a girl making crapes. As a tourist I decided that I have to try those crapes, so in 2 minutes I was inside. Nobody was welcoming me , ahah, but anyways, I just took a seat, so the girl were staring at me very weird, then I got that I have to order and then I can sit. A guy who was taking my order was very friendly and made a cappuccino for me. Can't say that coffee was perfect , half of it was just a foam, so it was made very unprofessionally, but anyways, I got the crape and it was very good! Not the best one, but good! Nice place for spending 15 minutes for a crape."}
{"text":"Good crepes, located at a wonderful location. With free wifi. Stuff is friendly. Love this place. Would come back."}
{"text":"I had the apple cinnamon crepe which was delicious. My husband had the smoked meat crepe and it did not disappoint. Great lattes - only thing to consider is they do not have skim milk or hot sauce."}
{"text":"Walked past this establishment and stopped to see the crepes being made. Then I saw they also served ice cream so I definitely had to go inside. You order your meal at the counter, pay and they bring you your order. Delicious, fast, and friendly service"}
{"text":"After a long day of walking in the city my family was in the need of a snack and light refreshments. We came into Caf√© CC and got our fill! The Apple Cinnamon crepe was delicious. We split one crepe and each got a drink (water, coffee, latte etc.)

We sat by the window, enjoyed our crepe and were left full. it really was the perfect afternoon pick me up. Staff is nice and they bring the food right to your table."}
{"text":"We walked by this shop the previous day. They clearly have something good going with the crepe maker up front with an open window. Smelled delicious. 

Came back the next day for a late breakfast. The seating is super comfortable and ordering was easy. Crepes came out fast!

We ordered egg and cheese crepes, mine included turkey in it. They were larger than expected and they tasted great!  Excellent savory crepes. The butter brown sugar crepe was a little disappointing. It lacked flavor overall and was a little overdone. 

Highly recommend this place for delicious savory crepes."}
