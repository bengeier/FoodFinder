{"text":"Coffee is very smooth and not too strong! crepes are very good, salads are huge and made with fresh mixed greens :) So happy this place is open so late and all night on weekends!!"}
{"text":"I love JoBot! I've taken three different people there and my boyfriend and I go absolutely any time we're downtown. We always get the iced toddy and put a little cream it in; for some reason, it's so much better than any other toddy we've had. I've tried six different crepes and I think my favorite one (so far) is the number nine, which has turkey, a sunny side egg, raspberry , and I think swiss. It is so good. I also really like the black bean one, but in corn tortillas (I love that option!). 
I've only had two of the sweet crepes: the peanut chocolate and the jam and cream one. I like the jam and cream one a lot better. 
I had a scone once and it was pretty good...not the best I've ever had. 

One problem I have with JoBot  is one particular server. She usually works the night shift and she's always so lazy. She's also pretty rude--I heard her correct a customer once and then they apologized...it was awkward. She's not accommodating when she should be and she rushes you when you're ordering. Seriously, every time I've been there while she's working, I haven't enjoyed myself as much as usual. 

Loooove the Jarritos, too!"}
{"text":"Came to try their crepes because of all the reviews. The environment was ok if you don't have a place to stay and want to sit around to study. If you are looking for a place to sit and have dessert and coffee with friends, you might have trouble finding a non-smoking area. The server will point you to the patio where smoking is free of charge. Crepes came out and presentation was good but the lemon crepe did not taste fully cooked or it was just plain and soggy. The nutella and strawberry was the same. Very soggy and tasted undercooked. Strawberries were fresh and not canned so that was the only good thing about the entire experience."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in SE Europe where crapes are a huge tradition. The \"B crape\" with Nutella and Banana was awesome! I also got the Sunrise coffee which is an OJ/coffee mix; it was interesting but not bad. 

We came on a Sunday and they have a DJ playing music on the patio and even sitting inside, it was nice to hear something different then a regular breakfast/coffee shop. I also noticed that dogs are welcome on the patio. 

Over all, the whole party, after never coming here before, ate everything and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place! I've been here multiple times and have now made it a Tuesday and Sunday ritual. 

Ambience: people have already commented on the \"hipster\" community here. It is strong. But they are friendly. 

Staff: seen standoffish but I realized that the more often you come the friendlier they are. 

Price: this place is extremely cheap, the quality of their products is outstanding. 

Drinks: their dirty chai lattes are the best I've ever experienced. They are not overly sweet like many places often make them. Perfect balance of spices. Their caramel lattes (hot or iced) are heavenly. I must say, my real favorites are their teas. In particular the African Rose Tea, the floral note isn't overpowering yet you definitely get the Rose essence. 

Food: I've never had the crepes everyone raves about but their beet salad is great. The lettuce is crisp and fresh, and they load it with pickled beets, blue cheese, walnuts, and the perfect ratio of dressing. It's huge. The quesadillas come fully loaded and are very filling. They make the food pretty fast, not much waiting. 

I would not recommend your first trip here to be on a Friday (especially first Friday) or Sundays simply because it is so packed! Also, if you hate smoking or are sensitive, I would stay inside the house.

Edit: I've had the crepes...they are worth the hype! Also, their iced toddy is really top notch."}
{"text":"I finally visited here today after leaving church in route to FEZ for my East Coast Foodies Event.  I walked in and was pleasantly surprised by how cute and welcoming  the space is.  It is also covered in local art and there is a cool counter where one can sit and eat, read, drink, or chat with their friends or the employees.  I love the mom and pop homey feel of this place.

They had some yummy looking food and sweets, but they seemed to be a little pricey for what you were getting.  Their scones were a little more than Starbucks, which is a little odd in that it is a small family owned business.

I loved my cappuccino, she ran the sugar through my shots of espresso, which I had never experienced before.  I was impressed by the yummy flavor and the delectable foam that the barista created.

I will go back and try the crepes next time and another drink.

Cheers"}
{"text":"We just moved to the nearby area and one afternoon we were so hungry that we thought why not give JoBot a try. 

We were not let down. We ordered Cappuccino and my wife really enjoyed it: not too bitter yet not too sweet, right in the spot.  The crepes were also good, although I would say the portion is not big, so it good for a quick snack while chatting with your friends."}
{"text":"Hooray to great coffee!
Came here for the first time (last night) which also happened to be First Friday. The place was PACKED! We must have come at the right time because after waiting in line for about 10 min there was a line out the door! 
Yes, service was slower then would have been ideal. Then again, if you're willing to wait in line to place your order, you should be willing to wait to receive said order.
I had a Soy Latte and after tasting it I could have cared less how much time I waited! The coffee was delicious, something I feel is very scarce lately.
I'd definitely like to come back and experience them during a normal week day."}
{"text":"I gave up meat a few months ago, the xhilaquiles here are the bomb! And I feel full nd happy :)"}
{"text":"Service ok, tea ok, atmosphere fun, but kind of stuffy inside sometimes"}
{"text":"jobot is an amazing addition to downtown phoenix, and in my opinion, the best new coffee shop. 

also, derrick is AWESOME and if anyone needs a new bike or their old bike fixed, he is still an integral part of downtown phoenix so hit him up....."}
{"text":"I dropped a friend off at Comic-Con and was feeling like exploring a bit while rush hour traffic died down. I decided to check out Jobot after seeing it was in the art district just a couple miles away.

(Parking can be found either in a 2-hour garage behind the building or on the street also behind)

So first up...


Drinks: *****
   Jobot has a decently sized menu with numerous choices for coffee, tea, and alcohol lovers alike. Most of the drinks can be made hot or cold. A lot of reviews here weren't fans of the chai latte so I opted for a cold brew. And man let me tell you about this cold brew. It's smooth yet full of flavor and body. I put a little honey in it which only made it better in my opinion. 5/5 would drink again.

Food: -
   I only spent a little time here so I didn't get a chance to try the food unfortunately.

Atmosphere: ****
   Rustic. Borderline hipster. Actually, no its definitely hipster. But that's a good thing. It gives it a cool laid back image. The lighting is warm and ambient, not bright or in-your-face. The music fit the image of this place albeit almost at bar-level volume. It's loud for a coffee shop let's say that. So if you're coming here to study or work, I'd recommend some headphones.

Smoking is allowed on the patio but that's not an issue for me, however if it is for you, you may want to hang out inside.

Service: **
   This is kinda where it fell below expectations for me. I walked in, no greeting. Not a big deal; I'm not expecting a red carpet for me when I come in. But it was more so the fact that I had to initiate conversation at the register. Even the dumpiest fast-food joint will at least have an unenthusiastic cashier asking me what I want first. Here it was just kinda stares until I asked what was the most popular. 

The barista/bartender making my drink definitely looked like they'd rather be anywhere but here. I get it. Food service isn't great, but I at least try to not look miserable when I'm working with customers.

I can't speak for any of the other employees here as I only had my experience with the one.

Overall: ****
   Jobot's cold brew is exceptional along with a nice inclusive menu for different drink lovers. The interior is messy, artistic, and attractive giving it a warm industrial feeling. I just wish the same could be said about the service. Regardless, I'd still probably bring a friend back to try it at least more time."}
{"text":"Jobot..you have good food and a fun upbeat atmosphere...but your employees are so painfully unfriendly. This opinion is not off a single experience. My husband and I live in the neighborhood and we say the same thing every time we stop in. It's unusual for Arizona too. Usually coffee shops offer a really friendly environment..but not jobot. Your employees are short and unapproachable. When I brought up the cream container stating it was empty I was simply handed the half and half carton no thank you..no helping a hand to fill it. Unfortunately a vibe of a place is so heavily reliant on the mood and attitude of those
that work there. We want to love jobot but so far we haven't been convinced."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect place for an after-ride coffee and Nutella crepe...  

The crepes here are truly to die for...  I have found a nice little bike route that lets me 'hammer it out' for 50 miles and then conveniently roll on through JoBot for some caloric goodness and caffeine.  This place has a great little patio to get some sun, park your bike, and eat some yummy food just before the muscles start cramping.

Give it try..."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and tea.  They will make your drink right and care about quality.  Generous business that supports local schools and teachers. They donated coffee gift cards to a school that serves low income students."}
{"text":"Today was my first trip to JoBot. Actually, now that I think about it, it was my second. It should count as my first time though, since the other time I had come with a friend who wanted to go somewhere else .... I don't know why.
But anyway! My first experience was very pleasant. The baristas were nice and friendly, the patio is dog friendly, and the coffee tastes amazing (and trust me, I've tasted a lot of coffee)! That's five stars in my book. (: I will definitely come back if I'm in the area again.

P.S. Would it be too cheesy to say thanks a latte right now? ;)"}
{"text":"I like this place... Definitely cozy, small space with couches and comfy seats in the corner.  Their chai is delicious and I love that they use the loose, real chai and not some crap syrup or powder. 

Being that they're known for their crepes, I ordered their (sweet) ricotta with lemon zest and dark chocolate. It was good and it was a good portion I couldn't finish it! What I didn't like though was there was hardly ANY ricotta. Almost an indiscernible amount. Other than that I love the place and will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great mint green tea and food is always on point. Do not expect exceptional customer service, service is just ok when I go. Would have rated five stars but their restroom...let's just say I'd rather hold it."}
{"text":"This is an excellent hole-in-the-wall find! This is the coffee shop that the locals patronize and I had an excellent crepe to compliment my coffee. The coffee itself was OK, not stellar, but the experience of the shop was authentic art/hipster Phoenix. Also, I was a new visitor to Phoenix and I had a bit of trouble finding the place. It's located in an old house on a street that looks like it could be abandoned. There is street parking only but if you're willing to drive around the block you can find a place."}
{"text":"Cool place in an old two-family house. Friendly staff. Cool sense if community judging from my brief visit. Coffee is custom profiled an toasted by the local Cartel Coffee Lab.  
Although the drinks (house-made chai and a cortado) were yummy their technique and bar space was pretty sloppy. 

The house-made pastries (gluten free and vegan chocolate, doughnut and vegan almond, berry, balsamic doughnut) were awesome. 
Worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Like this place, but I had the worst service once. I waited at the bar for 10 minutes. The guy with a beard saw me but he couldn't bring himself to ask if I needed anything. I had to get off my seat and go to the register to order. They should have an ORDER HERE sign if it's to hard to help people who are sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"The coffee is good but the morning staff needs to cheer up. Smile once in awhile!"}
{"text":"They are unbelievably kind and patient here! A lot of coffee shops make you feel rushed. I walked in and had no idea what I wanted but I knew I had to eat clean, they were completely accommodating.

The vanilla honey iced latte is delicious!! They make their own vanilla syrup with no corn syrup which has me sold!!! I will definitely be back for the coffee and the the blta"}
{"text":"so as many yelpers know, writing a review may require some deliberation and even some soul searching, this is that kind of review.
jobot is my frenemy - sometimes i want great coffee without the shitty attitude (imagine!!) and sometimes i dont care - yea its that kind of place. i know im not saying anything new here - ive been coming here since they opened & im always excited to go & then after...well its like eating donuts; excitement, anticipation, enjoyment then regret...you get the picture

coffee is pretty damn good
food is hit or miss - quality is usually above par, but serving size varies depending on the day (?) and for the price that aint cool!
service - well if you have enough gages and a tragic hair-do then youre in! but if youre like me & you love spandex and heels (dont hate im cute!!) then youre probably not in!! 
O well, i love good coffee!"}
{"text":"Great music on Sundays! Perfect if you wanna just chill & enjoy a latte. Sit on the love seat sooooo comfy."}
{"text":"Love love love.

My morning addiction. Coffee is excellent, boys are always entertaining, crepes are deeeelish, music is awesome, and I can hole up in the cute little living room and work while I get jacked up on caffeine. Oh! And the oatmeal too! Mmmmm...

This is a REAL coffee shop. The kind where people have conversations and you run into people you know - or meet new friends. If you suck, please don't ever, ever come here and feng up our shui. 

JoBot - I love you."}
{"text":"Great Place to grab a cup of STRONG Coffee! First off this is not your chained owed coffee shop where you need to know another language just to order a drink. The prices are reasonable and they always ask if you want the drink hot or iced. I got a endless drip coffee for $2.50. Also I like steamed milk in my coffee and they added some for no extra charge which was pretty cool of them. 

They have a killer selection of crepes all around $6 and are good sized. One that caught my eye was the Peanut butter, banana, and raspberry jam. They separate them into to menus the \"Savory\" crepes, and the \"Sweet\". I didn't try one this time but will for sure be back to have one. 

It is pretty small inside but they have a huge out side sitting area that is covered. A great place to sit and watch all the action that is going on of 5th st. On the weekend they are open till 4 am and serve their full menu till then. So if you are looking for a late night bite or a sobering cup o joe. Check out Jobot!!!"}
{"text":"Really cozy spot. The lattes are pretty good, but I recommend the prickly pear iced tea. Nice indoor seating and awesome staff."}
{"text":"Tired of going to coffee shops where you're greeted with a warm smile and are given great customer service?! Then JoBot is the place for you! Nestled in the Roosevelt Row area of downtown Phoenix, what was once a decrepit house is now a decrepit coffee shop! Come take a load off and have an overpriced cup of coffee served by someone with an undeserved sense of importance. Remember, it's a privilege for YOU to be served by THEM, and not the other way around. On top of that, you can order something off their nothing short of mediocre menu! Like crepes? Good! Because that's just about all your going to get! After you place your order you are blessed with the opportunity to surround yourself with the hippest of the hip. Let me tell, you haven't lived until you've had judgment passed on to you by people who spend an exuberant amount of money to look like vagrants. Once you're done, you can either sit back and enjoy the ambiance OR stick you hand in a running garbage disposal. Either way, you're going to lose a part of your being! 

Overall:
Food: 3
Service: -3
Ambiance: 2"}
{"text":"Customer service is usually great and I happily give the delicious, creative pastries five stars. The new A/C and knocking down all the inner walls really made it a great place to hang out year round!"}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the location! Once inside it is a warm and comfy atmosphere. Hubby and I each had the pancakes with blueberry sauce and a side of bacon. I don't usually order restaurant pancakes because they're not delicious. These however were amazing. The bacon was cooked perfectly crisp. Son had a veggie scramble and pronounced it delicious. He prefers his bacon extra crisp and they fulfilled that request perfectly. My only complaint was they didn't offer any decaf coffee...hubby's latte was really good as was son's house coffee. Staff was friendly-order and pay at the counter and they bring to the table."}
{"text":"Love this place. One of the best atmospheres around. Very helpful staff and awesome coffee and drinks. You gotta try the honey soy latte."}
{"text":"This has been our favorite place...until today.
We have been regulars at Jobot's since the beginning, when they were only using half of the house. We have gone several times a month since we found this place over 6 years ago. Today we went looking for two of our favorite dishes... the Jorito and the peanut butter chocolate crepe. The woman at the front asked us if we'd  been there in the last 2 weeks and since we hadn't,  she promptly notified us that the menu had changed. To our dismay, we read the low quality, downsized menu and noticed that they don't have EITHER of the items we buy regularly. She suggested the \"chorizo burrito\" which appeared to be similar to our beloved Jorito (minus the cheese, spinach and whole beans). When we got the new chorizo burrito....it was the saddest...nay....worst burrito I've ever had. It was like they took the \"eggs\"  (which I'm not even sure there were any in it) a teaspoon of tasteless/bland chorizo and some potatoes...and stuck them in a blender on puree, then threw a splatter of watery mush refried beans on top and put it all inside of a small, slightly overcooked tortilla. It was like eating baby food. We were so starving that we tried to save it with the hot sauce they give with it...it didnt work. We left with upset stomachs and heartburn. We paid the same price (8.50) we normally pay for the Jorito, for a seriously lacking emaciated mush burrito. We asked the cashier on the way out if they had changed the recipe for the chorizo itself and she said yes. It is now \"chorizo hash\"...we both replied that it was horrible/worst burrito we've  ever had. Shame on you,  Jobot owners, for cutting back an awesome menu and adding worthless new items...your customers have come to appreciate and love the menu you've  had all these years. Cutting back may seem feasible monetarily...but let me tell you...with quality like this, you will lose more customers than you would have, if you had left the menu the way it was...do you think removing almost every single sweet crepe and half of the savory ones...then adding some sort of \"corn porridge\" mush to the top of the menu would be an upgrade?  I saw that there was a cut back on the amount of items to have in the kitchen and cheap versions of everything you kept or added to the menu. You have just lost 2 devoted Jobot loving people, along with all of our friends. This is a sad day because now we have to look for a new hangout with quality food, coffee and tea, while we dream of how your food used to taste. The reason this review is so scathing is that our favorite place to eat and hang out has just been taken from us by force. Let us know if you ever bring back the Jorito or peanut  butter chocolate crepe!! That is all."}
{"text":"Great food!

I enjoy the laid back atmosphere. When i first went here I had no idea they even had a kitchen but they do and the food was great and the coffee was awesome. I would recommend this to anyone in the area who wants to get a taste of downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I don't even drink coffee and I love this place! Why? The baked foods are amazing, the donuts especially! I got the vanilla bean cinnamon sugar one today and it was delicious - as are the chocolate and brown butter. I've heard good things about the coffee too :)"}
{"text":"Hands down, this is my favorite coffee shop in Phoenix. Their coffee is amazing, as well as their crepes! I have to stop here everytime I go downtown. The employees are always very friendly, and I love their cute latte art! JoBot is located in a quaint little building with adorable vintage funiture and wood floors."}
{"text":"I have tried. I really have. This now the third time after eating at jobot  regularly that I have gotten sick from chorizo crepe. 

Sorry Jobot. Im calling health inspector. 

I love this place but My gut just cant take it anymore... Sigh"}
{"text":"Tasty crepes and delicious coffee! I was only in Phoenix for a day and happened to be staying in the neighborhood. This place was perfect."}
{"text":"Freaking horrid, burnt & stale chips, burnt potatoes, burnt coffee. Iced coffee tasted like water even when remade. Bummer."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place! The food has been fresh and delicious every single time I've been here. I'm in love with their green chili fries because they are quite possibly one of the best things I've ever eaten AND they're vegetarian and can easily be made vegan. Every once in awhile they have a special dish they're serving that weekend and whenever I see pictures of it on Facebook I wish I could've been there to taste it. The employees are always super cool and friendly and there's always good music playing. Overall I love the vibe of this place and I really appreciate their hours of operation because it's nice knowing I can order pancakes at 11pm without having to go to Denny's or somewhere disgusting."}
{"text":"This is my second time I've been in here and each time the service has been less than stellar. This review started out as a 3, but declined as my interaction with the rude clerk progressed. I asked to have the bar wiped down and the clerk with dark hair and glasses was attitudinal about doing it, she proceeded to wait on customers around me. I then, called her out on it and she had an incredibly flimsy excuse as to why. She hesitantly, took my order and interrupted taking it to wait on another customer. I will be reviewing this coffee shop on my blog and talk show. I shall not return."}
{"text":"Best coffee I've had in my life. Used to enjoy it at Conspire, very happy he has a bigger location with more seating and a wonderful patio to people watch on 5th st.

Did I mention best coffee I've had in my life?

Great fit for the neighbourhood, glad to have you, JoBot!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.   Flavor is not waters down at all.  Balls out.  Great atmosphere.   Only ate breakfast to Floyd in my own house...until now.  Great experience."}
{"text":"Umm... let's see, this place is kind of stinky.  I mean that in a kind of literal sense.  Over in San Fransisco this place would not make it.  This place is more like a stinky starbucks than a real coffee shop.  I got a crepe and it took like forever.  24 hours... More like 24 How?  Er!!!!  Don't waste your time, and save your time, try the nacho stop around the corner."}
{"text":"Undrinkable coffee. Sorry to the hipster doofus crowd but the coffee is horrible. made the mistake of listening to others who suggested this place while taking some friends from Europe through the downtown redevelopment. None of us was willing to take a second sip, our first tasting so awful. Better to grab your coffee at Lux instead."}
{"text":"I'm so confused by the reviews saying its 24hours since I've shown up at 6:55am and they were closed until they opened at 7am. I like it here but I wish they had consistent internet it's not acceptable to just say \"sorry it doesn't working sometimes\" I just bought food and have to sit down to work on something that requires the Internet. I still like the place but that's really not okay."}
{"text":"Very quaint food and coffee place. I really enjoy their nutella strawberry crepes and iced mochas. Nice place to sit and relax and bring your laptop."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the coolest little downtown coffee cafe!  It offers a variety of seating options in a comfortable indoor/outdoor retro throwback style. The sweet and savory crepes made with fresh from the farm ingredients are of the highest quality. Just an awesome place to spend a relaxing morning."}
{"text":"Great coffee, but I cannot fully relax there. It's pretty and unique place though.
I would stop by and get some coffee on the way to go somewhere, but it's not the place for me to relax, or concentrate on sketch and PC works."}
{"text":"I will definitely be coming back here. Even though the hipster scene isn't really my thing, this place is awesome! I loved the different types of available seating. We ended up sitting outside in a very secluded area for our business meeting. The drinks were pretty good. Service was great. And the food... SOOOOO GOOOD. I ordered the crepe with chorizo and an egg on top and I could not get over how excellent it was. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. I also had a brown butter muffin thing which was amazing as well."}
{"text":"This is no corporate coffee house!  This is de-frickin-licious coffee!  Crepes...TRY THE CREPES!  Heaven!"}
{"text":"Love coming here with my friends!  Just to chill and catch up! Also did I mention its open 24 hours on the weekends!The Savory Crepes are soo good! And I always get an iced mocha coffee to go with it."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in for breakfast since we were already in the area. After reading the reviews on yelp we decided to give this spot a go, but boy were we disappointed. First thing that caught our eye was the Resturant/shack. This is the true definition of \"hole In the wall\". Now having my share of finding hidden gems we weren't turned off by the lack of esthetics. Once inside we looked over the menu to be disappointed. Expecting to see waffles on the menu they were no where to be found! Strike one. After deciding on pancakes and crepes I ordered a cold brew which seemed to be their signature drink. Not only was it weak, but the white mocha coconut flavoring had no taste. Strike two. After waiting for what seemed too long our food finally arrived. The pancakes looked decent and the crepes were ok. After the first bite I knew we would never visit this establishment again. Just like the coffee the food was bland :(  considering the bill being high for breakfast we expected way more than sub par food and mediocre service. My advice to management revamp your menu to match the eclectic vibe of the area."}
{"text":"I love coming here to work, to read, to chat with friends, or after beer next door. Best burrito I've ever had, not kidding. They're so nice, too - they lost my ticket for a BLT last time and offered me dessert on the house when my food was late, and they felt so bad! I appreciate such conscientious service. Thanks Jobot!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Vintage look, neighborhood vibe, nice temperature inside, great people-watching, AWESOME food!

I always get the toddy here, but not after 4pm, or I'll be up until the next day. I think that's a good thing, just plan ahead for that though. 

I really wanted to write this review for the food. The crepes are so much fun. No one does crepes, and they have savory and SWEET. My hubster and I usually get one of each. The salads, beet salad - taco salad - chop salad, all WONDERFUL. The presentation is great too. I do believe this is the artistry of Parris. She has been the chef typically when we come here. 

This is the only coffee shop open late in my neighborhood. Thanks Jobot!

The only reason for a 4 rating is the number of teenagers that swarm outside several times a week. I'm allergic to teens, it must be their hormonal aura or something."}
{"text":"It's been over three months and we're still going strong. JoBot Coffee is phenomenal. Love the iced toddy, love the people and love the atmosphere. Always good people watching on the spacious patio and a lovely place to watch fireworks I might add. 
...I knew it was love at first sight!"}
{"text":"Good drip coffee. Bold.
Good crepe. Big and filling.
Great scone.
Nice location.
A bit spacey on the service."}
{"text":"Very interesting place. Not the crowd you'd expect but worth checking out.

After seeing this place straight up popping on a Frist Friday, I knew I needed to come in and try it out. The patio is a funky mosiac of painted concrete squares with a small yard with park picnic tables all in range of some loud speaker playing music from inside. When you first walk in the place seems realy small and tight, and that's because it is. Take a left and you'll find more booth style seating but walk forward and you can prop up on the counter and order. Everything looks like its about to fall off the shelves or just fall asleep... including the guy behind the table. There's a little wall fridge of sodas and baked goods then the expresso machines and syrup racks line the backsplash of the bar area. Don't get the wrong idea, dude behind the counter is cool as hell. Came up to me and asked what I'd like, told him something sweet and he immediately starting hooking me up with options and built an bomb caramel iced coffee. Was nice and asked if I drank whole milk... how sweet.

From what I saw coming from the kitch, this joint is cranking out stellar food. Wish I could have stayed for breakfast. Will def come back here on a day I'm not dressed for work and I can look like a bum too. Thanks counter guy for not making me feel weird for being the only girl in there."}
{"text":"Great for morning breakfast and coffee on the benches outside. Fantastic biscuits and gravy. Great crepes. Very laid back and quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"Strolled in on a Sunday morning. Saw pigeons on the table outside so you guessed it, we opted to eat inside. Atmosphere was hipster-ish but cozy. Crepes A and F were quite tasty, I prefer A with the house berry jam and ricotta. Caramel latte and Chai latte were yummy. You can actually taste the coffee and chai, which always seems to be overpowered by the milk when I order these at Starbucks or Dutch Bros. If I could, I'd take off half a star giving this place a 4.5, because we had to wipe down our own table. Overall is was a good experience!"}
{"text":"I just have to give another shout-out to Jobot, my very favorite coffee joint in Phoenix.  Went there on a recent Sunday morning, and the special was \"Slayer Cakes!\"  This was 2 buttermilk pancakes with a bacon pentagram on top...mmm...bacon!  The place has been expanded, with additional indoor seating options, but I love the patio.  When I sit out there and watch the liveliness that is 5th St., it makes me happy."}
{"text":"To be completely fair... the extra star is because of the vibe alone.

On my birthday I was cruising through Roosevelt Ave. on my motorized bike(R.I.P) and found this house shaped coffee shop where music from around the side of the house lured me in. They had a DJ spinning in a corner outside and bikes lined the front fence. So naturally I gravitated that direction. 

I walked in and it seemed fairly busy and while I waited in line I scoped out the shelves where awards and novelty items sat. The one thing that cause my eye was the award they received for a chili cook out(or something of that sort) so when my turn came-which now that I think of it took maybe a little too long, I asked if i could try it out, only to find that they didn't have it as an option. I reconstructed my self quickly after this earth shattering news and scanned the menu, at the top of the list is the Jo-Momma breakfast sandwich. Which seemed like a fun take on a classic which I am a sucker for... \"An over easy egg on half a toasted torta roll, topped with tomato, spinach, cheddar cheese, pit smoked ham and house honey dijon sauce\"

The turn over time wasn't bad and because of the live DJ and great weather I opted to eat on the porch. My first thought when looking upon this \"sandie\" was it seemed like over kill with the spinach, but I pressed on. I tackled this mound-o-leaf and sandwich with a fork and knife and was hoping for some wow-ness, but instead I found I was over looking the sandwich and just trailing off in thought. The house dijon has a sweetness to it and probably lots of potential but it was lost in the leaves and the egg was a little over cooked for me, something I should have specified honestly, cause I prefer my eggs runny, like my nose, jk. Everything seemed to kind of fight with each other and there wasn't an over arching theme or sense of balance I was able to take away from it, but for the price, it filled me up and well that's a win."}
{"text":"Not just a great coffee shop. Amazing, creative menu for breakfast and lunch! Loved the crepes too. Don't let the exterior fool you, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Nice underground type of feel to this place. Good menu, good music, nice girls working, and I like anyplace that let's you bring your dog. Better than a lot of the other contrived hipster places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Just fantastic! New to the neighborhood and saw this joint on my way out of town. Stopped and grabbed breakfast to go...cold brew iced coffee and a veggie scramble. The coffee was some of the best I've had in a long time, and the food was perfectly homemade. It came with a fresh warm tortilla and some rich homemade salsa (welcome to Phoenix). I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I feel like Jobots is somewhere you should really try out if you haven't. You will go back and leave satisfied:) The service can be a little slow, but be patient, they are hand crafting these masterpieces!
They also always have something delicious you can munch on while posting up there as well:)"}
{"text":"Get the god damn biscuits and gravy! Not what I expected, but brilliantly exicuted. The chorizo gravy, and the eggs and potatoes, just perfect! Local buisness, good folks, please support this place."}
{"text":"Really great breakfast. Very simple ambiance but the quality of espresso and ingredients they use is quite exceptional for this little hole in the wall :) will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic crepes, strong Americanos, and overall great experience. The location is a small house next to Lost Leaf. While the coffee is great, the five stars are for the crepes! I always get the Nutella, banana crepe with whipped cream. While it might not be the greatest for a diet, it was well worth it!!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed coffee here since before they moved next to The Lost Leaf in the old Hoodride location. The new location is sweet. You can post up at the bar with your laptop probably next to some cute girl with her laptop, or chill out front on the patio. But back to the liquid gold which is their coffee. Since I don't live to close to downtown, I usually buy a pound of beans to french press at home. When I'm in the neighborhood, I drink their Americano's which when I was recently in Seattle, I could not find one that compares to JoBots. Seriously, they take their beans serious. I've purchased some when they were roasted the day before, mmmmmmmmmm. 

I think they are adding food soon and are working on their kitchen now. There is also a cute little art gallery next door (in the same building) where you can sip away they day looking at Casebeer and Randals art. I think Randal is a barista there also. Best porch in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Yummy fresh food, free WiFi, chill vibe, fun music. Dog-friendly patio.  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"This is the best hipster-watching, crepe-eating, latte-drinking place I know!

The hubs and I love to go to Jobot for breakfast and great coffee on the weekends.  Relaxed atmosphere, nice staff,  tasty crepes, delicious coffee, rotating artists work on the walls and free wifi.  What else could you want from your neighborhood coffee shop?"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I will not be going back to this place. I was just in there earlier and noticed a few unsanitary things about this place. The only reason I gave them 2 stars was because the coffee tasted good despite it having contaminated ice (hope I don't get sick). 

So this is what happened for those curious:

I walked in and sat down. The girl working, who looked extremely hungover, did not greet me or say any word to me as i looked at the menu. She just stood there until I asked for something. I ordered a coffee and a crepe. While she was making my coffee, she scooped the ice out of a dingy looking ice container and just dropped the scoop back in. She did this multiple times while I was there. The germs from her hand  were all over the ice and in everyone's drinks...

Then, she kept wiping down all the counters with the SAME dirty rag over and over again. And after she got done \"wiping\" (or spreading everything) on the counter, a guy that was working, not sure if it was the owner or not, decides to start making some drinks for people after being outside, without washing his hands. He picked up a clean spoon to mix in caramel in some coffee and threw the spoon down on the counter right in front of me. Then, when he was making another drink, he picked up the SAME spoon from the dirty counter and used it to mix someone else's drink. He was very sloppy making the drinks, which doesn't bother me until you get unsanitary with it. I am very concerned nothing is cleaned properly just by their behavior, including the bucket of ice the girl brought in to refill the ice container. I am sure this place isn't the only one that does this stuff but having it happen all in front of you is a whole other experience.

I was not able to really enjoy my crepe because I was too focused on all this going down, so I will not write a review on the food. I feel sick to my stomach."}
{"text":"JoBot has moved!!! To a bigger better location. 3rd St and Roosevelt. Beer menu is on point!!"}
{"text":"Coffee good. Crepes muy tasty. 

However, waiter lady, it's like you pretended not to notice me and my guest because you wanted to talk with your co worker.

My quick game of \"which of these things is not like the other\" was that guest and I were not tatted up and hipstered out like you and the other patrons. All I wanted was some coffee."}
{"text":"Alas, I've arrived! Finally, a place that can really brew tea! The Earl Grey iced is luxurious! Truly a tea drinker's delight!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing! Everything fresh and hands down just good! My first time here and definitely will be a returning customer !!! I came pretty early in the morning so it wasn't too busy! This place is great for late night /early munchies that's for sure!  Also the food is great priced and perfect portions! Great for locals or  travelers! Thanks jobot for being here for us food lovers!"}
{"text":"Yippie! I'm not a coffee drinker but I do down a gallon or so of tea a day. Today, Tara made me an iced black tea. It's nice to see the tea actually being made in front of your eyes rather than getting blended or straight from yesterday's pitcher. I give Jobot 5 stars for making a good drink, cleanliness, and hospitality. Piss on Starbucks."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years and it's changed so much! And for the better. The coffee is reasonably priced, which means it's cheaper than Starbucks (and has higher quality beans), and the vibe is really laid back. If you're sick of going into super snobby coffee shops - go here! 

I ordered an iced latte with almond milk. Unfortunately, the almond milk started to separate. It's fine to drink, but pretty unappealing. I asked if they would remake it with soy milk and they did it without question. There is plenty of seating indoor and outdoor and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town. I can see why this place is my friend's favorite!"}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with friends and have breakfast. The seminal coffeeshop in downtown phoenix."}
{"text":"They make a good latte here, which is something I feel the need to mark after being unpleasantly surprised over and over by inexplicably disgusting results elsewhere.  (HOW HARD IS IT, LUCY AND LOLA?)  I've been here three times, and the service was fast and friendly on each visit.  

I don't think I'm a fan of the crepes, not through any particular fault of Jobot, but they're just not my steeze.  I had the one with cheese, tomatoes, and onions, and it was delicious, but much too heavy and greasy for my life.  Also, what the fuck even is crepe?  

Crepes aside, Jobot is a strong place.  Happy with them."}
{"text":"Coffee was hot, the atmosphere was friendly, wifi was solid, and the breakfast plate I had was full of good textures and flavors."}
{"text":"Nice quiet place in the city. Cool scenery and design. Lots of trees and plants. Good coffee. Menu looked good and reasonably priced. They have sandwiches and breakfast stuff. It was quiet and relaxing"}
{"text":"I went on Third Fridays (June) and felt bad for the barista as there was a bit of a line and it seemed like she was the only employee around. However, she was pretty good about keeping an eye on the line and taking the orders of people in the order they arrived (despite all of us lounging around the counter haphazardly).

It was hot so I ordered a 20oz iced Americano. It was quite possibly the worst Americano I've ever had- so much so that I threw it out halfway through drinking it. I watched the barista prepare it and while I would prefer my portafilters be cleaned between orders, the part I'm outraged over is when I only received 2 shots (that's TWO OUNCES) of espresso in my TWENTY OUNCE drink.

Come on now. The only flavors Americanos have come directly from the espresso since water is essentially flavorless. Isn't it standard procedure to, at minimum, have 4 shots of espresso in a 20oz Americano? I stopped paying attention to the way the rest of my drink was made, but it seemed to warm up fairly quick. Maybe the ice to water ratio was off too?

Here is how to make a 20oz iced Americano: fill the glass all the way with ice, pull 4 shots of espresso (please clean the portafilter beforehand), pour espresso shots slowly into glass full of ice, top off with COLD water if necessary (if they don't need room for cream/milk).

I'll probably be back to give their food options a chance. The Nutella crepe looks delish."}
{"text":"Hipster? I guess so, I'm from Eugene so this place feels like home.
I had the Monte Cristo crepe - Delish.
Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great coffee, good food, affordable prices, interesting setting.
My only snag: I support diversity, but when it's 95% hipsters, well, that really doesn't seem like diversity.  I felt like I didn't belong cuz I didn't have the requisite amount of tatoos!     Well, you can't win 'em all!  

JoBot's is currently under construction, I look forward to returning and see how it turns out."}
{"text":"I ordered a crepé, she said \"we're out of Nutella\" I asked if she could just do syrup instead. She said\"we have syrup for I pancakes but we try not to stray from the menu\" I said I'm fine thanks."}
{"text":"Since their move to this new location, JoBot has lost something. It's just not the same. The space is very commercial and not intimate anymore. JoBot is commercial and not intimate anymore. But what really bothers me is the smokers. JoBot allows smoking in their outdoor area. This means those of us who don't smoke cannot enjoy that space. Even sitting in front of JoBot, the smoke blows around the corner and right across what could be a nice place to enjoy a cup of coffee. Today I again had to leave because a smoker lit up in the outdoor space. I won't be back"}
{"text":"Jobot is a wonderful place with great hours and great coffee. Best iced toddy in AZ, and I can order a cappuccino to go... win!"}
{"text":"I think Jobot is pretty conveniently located, and the staff is really nice.  I think the portion sizes could be better given the price of the food.  I love the crepes.  They are really filled so that you never feel like there isn't enough nutella, peanut butter, fruit, etc.  The filling to crepe ratio is really good, and the size of the crepe is really good, definitely worth the price.  I've also had their biscuits and gravy.  It comes with a chorizo gravy, two biscuits, salsa, and eggs.  The salsa flavor is great, the flavor of the chorizo is good, eggs were cooked well, but the biscuits were underwhelming in terms of size.  I also had a chai latte and it was on the watery side.  Otherwise, all the food had really good flavors, but I wish there was more food given the price."}
{"text":"Cool little joint.  They are open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Good local coffee spot! Haven't found too many in Phoenix.  I Like the unique down to earth vibe and the fresh cherry chocolate scone was delish!!"}
{"text":"I am not a coffee drinker so I cannot attest to what JoBot allegedly best but the crepes were delicious.  The menu offered crepes of a hearty variety (with meats and cheeses) and those of a desert variety (fruits, chocolate and whipped cream).  Waiting next door for a band to begin I worked up a hunger so I opted for the machaca pulled pork crepe with mozzarella and a fantastic salsa that was actually hot.  As a Michigan native I was pleased to see JoBot stocks Faygo Root Beer and was happy that I could enjoy the sweet nectar of my childhood to wash down my tasty meal.

Phoenix's Roosevelt Row has much to offer.  JoBot Coffee adds to the mix very well.  

I will be back."}
{"text":"In love with Jo....but he's part Bot....man vs machine....can I have both?

:/

The new space is mighty fine.

Delicious coffee! Delightful! Divine!

My favorite part is the new patio a go go! and the spare room for \"chillin\" with your iced-mocha with soy no whip extra shot double pumped caffeine feind shaken not stirred yes please and thank you!

So tute!


Also..the best part, it knows what it is:  unpretentious furnishings and VIBE. I like this place. I love my Bots."}
{"text":"I stopped in to JoBot this morning to grab a tea and study. I had been told by classmates that it was a perfect place to be productive. They definitely recommend it as their number one coffee shop.

I was pleased with my mint green tea-- although I don't think that teas are typically a good representation of a place's overall product. As far as the atmosphere, the music was way too loud to get any studying done. Also, I felt extremely overdressed in business clothes. It would be the perfect place to come spend the day and hang out, possibly working on a craft project, or something that can be done with loud music on (there were people there working on a paper arts project). I didn't find it the best place to study difficult material though. 

4/5 overall (bonus point for location, and being in a historic building)
2/5 for a place to study or be productive"}
{"text":"Service, Environment, and Taste .... SUPERB!!! 
Sundays they have beats and brunch with a live DJ!"}
{"text":"\"I'm beyond the age of hitting a coffeehouse at 3am now...\"

So says the guy who shows up to Jobot at 4am with his backpack, ready to do some work. Said guy is on UK time and has already been awake for 2 hours.

And Jobot? Open! And packed with people winding down from a long night of partying, devouring crepes before they all hauled off to slumber. It felt like a late night pizza joint in Manhattan, except instead of everyone woofing down giant folded slices with their bare hands, it was hipsters eating crepes with fork and knife and discussing the merits of Mazzy Star, and not a pizza in sight (although technically, Jobot does have a pizza-ish crepe here). 

Anyway, eventually all the other patrons left (\"oh my god...I need to sleep so bad\") and I was the only customer sitting there, typing away, downing great, strong ice toddys and tasty crepes and eventually seeing the sky slowly begin lighten up outside. 

Peace.

I eventually left Jobot, drove east on McDowell towards Papago Park, and enjoyed the fantastic sunrise, as I'll very soon be heading back to England  where seeing the sun at any time of day is more or less a very rare luxury.

So 5 stars, Jobot, for great coffee, great food, and great hours. My jetlagged brain salutes you.

Well done."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place in the valley.  The coffee is awesome,  the food is awesome, and they often have really cool art.  They host fun artsy events too. If you have never been here it is a must see place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"What an awesome little find! I stopped in to get a cup of coffee and wait for my daughter to get out of a concert and I love this place! The music, the staff, and the coffee are all outstanding. I've never given a place a review before but I had to for this one!"}
{"text":"Man, I REALLY love the food and the coffee here, but I don't think I've ever felt so unwelcome in a business in my life, ... seriously. 

So... Let me tell you how my JoBot experience went down today. This is how it went down. I ordered a couple of crepes and a coffee from the incredibly friendly gentleman with the long hair. Then I went over to the register where the bald dude (the owner) was standing. I stood there for several minutes, holding my bank card in the air, while he ignored me and continued talking to some guy next to me about cameras. After a good, long while the owner finally looked at me and said, \"Why do you keep looking at me?!\", in just about the shittiest tone possible without necessitating a fist fight. I was pretty taken aback. I just said, \"Uh... I'd like to pay for the things I just bought.\" The guy next to me who witnessed this unprecedented level of snobbery said, \"Wow, dude. You were so nice about it too. I'm impressed. It takes a real man to be polite after that one.\" Then the owner continued to process my order (17 dollars), without saying a word of any sort, let alone a thank you. I'm a very mellow guy, but after that I was so pissed I thought about walking out. I'm still angry.

I make it a point to be as reasonable and polite as humanly possible with anyone in the service industry. It's part of my moral code to use only my most impeccable manners when dealing with service people as I know they put up with a lot of shit in their line of work. I just can't fathom asking any customer \"Why do you keep looking at me?!\", under any reasonable circumstances. I mean, WTF? I was just standing there, card in hand, waiting to give him my money. 

I'm going to have to do one of three things. 

Option A - I never go to JoBot again. 

Option B - I convince myself that the owner has \"some sort of mental problem\" and that he doesn't understand that he's being an asshole to the customers. 

Option C - Keep going to JoBot like nothing happened and just expect to be loudly and openly disrespected by a cackling dimwit when I go to pay for my food."}
{"text":"I enjoy trying all the local places on Roosevelt row and occasionally come to JoBot, since my fiancé loves it. My lattes are hit or miss here...depending on the barista which can be disappointing if you're paying $5 for a latte and it's not that great. The food is delicious though! I love the blueberry scones! They don't always have them, but if you stumble across them I highly recommend. I love that they use fresh blueberries! I've also had the chilaquiles, which are amazing! I rarely eat them, but if I'm here I always indulge :) Overall, the food is tasty and coffee can be great depending on the barista which is why I gave 3 stars, especially considering they are a coffee shop it should remain consistent."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a coffee shop where you can literally roll out of bed and into a hipster-bungalow-coffee world, in your jammies (or whatever other random attire suits your fancy), look no further than Jobot!

The vibe here is different than anything else in Phoenix and seems to attract the beatnik artist/starving student type... all decked out with their journals, laptops and shared creative energy mantra.

The staff is cool, the coffee is solid and I tasted a small slice of heaven while I was there (the pumpkin pie with graham cracker crust and whip - YUM TO THE MAX!)

If you plan on sitting outside, you should be into, or love to be around, chain smoking."}
{"text":"This place is a little too hippie/beatnik-bungalow for me, but I am still too much of a sucker for a well run local joint with a solid product to downgrade it for my bias. The atmosphere is nice, comfy, and open. The service we had on our visit was grand. The barista was friendly and informative when I asked her a few questions on the drink I ordered. And, most importantly of all, the drinks were really good."}
{"text":"Alright, so there's no way I can get around to saying this without coming across like kind of a douche:  Jobot hits all the right notes, like a very good European coffee bar.

There's enough room to hang out, but not enough room to encourage the sprawl of a Lux-esque MacBook party.  You can still get some work done, but the space just isn't set up in a way that allows to abuse their hospitality by using the bar as your office.

It can also be a very social spot, with room at the bar to chat, or plenty of comfy furniture outside and in the adjoined extra room to relax,  but the baristas can all also pull a good shot of espresso (looking at you here, Fair Trade).

They've got toddy - tasty, cold-brewed coffee - which is a prerequisite of being a good coffee shop in Phoenix (or anywhere in the summer, really).

And the food?  The baked goods are tasty, but the crepes are fantastic, whether your craving the sweet or the savory."}
{"text":"I went back and tried the breakfast sandwich and I was a fan of this item. The sandwich is on jalapeno bread, but it was pretty mild which worked for me. It didn't take nearly as long as it did the first time around.

But yup! :)"}
{"text":"Went here with friends while enjoying first Friday. Love the atmosphere and just relaxed with a cup of joe ;)"}
{"text":"I really love the local vibe of JoBot Coffee. They are located in a residential area where houses have been turned into businesses. It feels like some of my favorite places to go back in UT.  The artist in me wants to take my Digital Rebel with me next time to get some artistic shots of the coffee shop as well as surrounding area's.

There is a great sized patio which I hear is great for the days they are super busy. I happened to go in on a day where not a lot of people were there and there were lots of seating options. As you walk into the coffee shop there is a long bar you can sit at where on the other side the barista makes your drink. The way they prepare drinks here is quite intriguing. The man who was working that day was not the most socially open person and because this place is more \"hipster\" and laid back, I get the impression customer service isn't high on their list of priorities. He treated us just fine and we received our food and drinks in a timely manner. But when you work at Nordstrom... ya know... you have a certain idea of what customer service should be. Thats all. 

I ordered an iced soy mocha latte and the black bean crepe. Holy miss moly, these crepes are huge. In my opinion, you could split a crepe between two people. When it came to the drink, the man started off by preparing our espresso shots, drizzled the chocolate syrup into our cups then poured a measurement of soy milk into the cup. While the espresso was brewing he took his time carefully stirring the chocolate into the milk. He then poured the espresso into the mixture and again slowly stirred it for a period of time. He then topped it off with ice and a little more soy milk and voila. The best iced soy mocha latte I have ever had. The crepe? pretty fantastic too! Great flavor and fresh. 

I will certainly be going back to try some of their dessert crepes and other coffee beverages. Hopefully I'll also get a chance to walk around the area, snap some photo's and also hang out at some of the surrounding boutiques as well."}
{"text":"The lattes here are great - they are my #2 favorite in all of Phoenix and are one of the reasons (Royal being the other) that I was finally able to quit Starbucks for good!  I usually get the white mocha which isn't too sweet.  I also really enjoy their chai - its not from some sugar loaded concentrate crap and you can actually taste the spices!  I've been meaning to try the toddy and will get around to it now that its warmer. 

Great espresso aside - going here makes me feel kind of lame.  I feel like everyone here knows each other!  The baristas all know every other customer and everyone is waving to each other and talking to each other and I'm just here  alone. Playing Scrabble on my phone. 

This coffee shop is one of the most hipster filled places I have ever been to and it fun to people watch and oogle at the cute fixie bikes.  On Sunday mornings they have a live DJ."}
{"text":"Been to this spot a few times. I judge a coffee place on their iced chai. It can't be too clovey, and you gotta be able to taste,every other thing It. jobot hits the nail on the head for this one. The food is good. Not like \"oh my God imma flip\" good. But it's made in house. Fresh ingredients. Can't go wrong. The atmosphere is awesome. It's in downtown Phoenix. a lot of hipsters. But once you get past that, you can be left alone while you do your homework, play boardgames with your friends, or sit on the patio and discuss basically anything to antagonize the hipsters."}
{"text":"I love anything beautiful. And this location is very neat with a cool vibe. The staff are very kind and helpful. The coffee is very good, and I can be very picky with my coffee. The right amount of espresso shots and sweetness."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere and tasty coffee. They do have liquor and when I asked for an Irish coffee the girl seemed to have no idea what I was talking about. It is a pretty common drink, you think they would hire or train their staff to know this if they're going to carry liquor and coffee. When I told her the 3 ingredients she tried to charge me $12! I have worked in the restaurant industry for years and this girl definitely had no idea what she was doing. Jobot, either hire better staff or actually train the ones you already have!"}
{"text":"Love to have a new 'favorite' coffee spot. Too bad when Willow house left the Mcdowell area. The outdoor seating is awesone, but don't  try to get in there either with a stroller or wheelchair. There is a big step you need to get up to get in the front door. Yes, these are the old downtown houses, such a pretty neighborhood again. It has risen from the death :)
Going again this weekend. Love the crepes, yummy choices, especially as a European, I am loving it when they know how to make good crepes."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood! Although kind of scary at night. Jo Bots was awesome, the worker (possibly owner?) is pretty awesome and our drinks came out quite fast and delicious. The barista made us some hot chocolates out of ghardelli (I'm pretty sure I spelled that wrong) chocolate and steamed it up. This is nice place just to hang out and enjoy the company of one's friends :)"}
{"text":"I came here with my wife because of Yelp. It was great. We had fun and enjoyed ourselves. We'd definitely go back. Food and drinks were good and so was the service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in downtown PHX.  The food is elevated and always impresses.  The coffee is delicious.  I'm so glad they were able to find a bigger and better location.  Jobot fan forever!"}
{"text":"JoBot Coffee is a very cool and hipster coffee/breakfast/lunch spot. I was in Phoenix for a few days and found this place due to high ratings. We were going on a hike, but i wanted some coffee beforehand and we ended up here. We both got two iced coffees  (it was very strong coffee) and I also bought one Pear donut that was seriously out of this world! Considering the size of the shop, they have a pretty extensive menu and everything sounds and looks good. 

The best part to me was the outdoor patio - coming from a city that's been under a polar vortex, I was in pure bliss sitting outside in beautiful weather, enjoying the view, and the nice crowd. There was a DJ playing some Indie Rock on the side of the building, so that just added on to the experience. 

It's also a dog friendly cafe which always makes me super happy since I never see that back at home. I can't wait to come back to Phoenix and when I do, JoBot will be my coffee stop!"}
{"text":"This place is crazy and I love it!  I've always had good Chai and coffee here.  The have some crazy good donuts and I have a salad and veggie burrito that I would definitely comeback for.  It is certainly odd inside - but a cool odd with cool odd people - open to cool odd hours.  It is just what it is and it's proud of it.  There's always a crowd here and we look forward to stopping by on Art Walk nights!  Love it!"}
{"text":"This place beats Starbucks' smug little ass. Coffee quality is awesome and you aren't charged for adding extras like agave syrup, soy or almond milk, etc. The crepes and pastries are fresh and creative. This whole joint is just obscenely well priced. Why go to a boring chain when there's local places like this serving better stuff?

We had an iced mocha and iced toddy to drink. For grub we chose one savory crepe filled with cheese and beef and a dessert one with sweet ricotta and cinnamon. I'm in love with the sweet ricotta and so ready to smear it on everything."}
{"text":"JoBot is the spot to go for a nice cold Chai or Iced Chamomile Tea at any time, literally their open twenty-four-seven. This place is soo uniquely cool. I like it!!
Oh and they even have a cool little piano inside!! Mad nice!!
 It's weird how I get a look like, \" What's this girl doing here?!\" almost every time I come here. It's more FUNNY, than upsetting!! :)
 No worries, I guess I'm not their usual clientele. Oh well, they'll get use to it eventually! It might be the bright colors I sometimes frequently wear, who knows?!."}
{"text":"This place doesn't serve decaf, which is awesome.
Its a cool little coffee dive in an old house with really good coffee. I recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian soda, really nice staff. Great look, Love it. I for sure recommend it"}
{"text":"Some of the reviews on this place are hella petty. If the chorizo crepe made you sick TWICE, why order it a third time? Get something else, weirdo. And we all know that places like this always have kinda rude hipsters working....get over it. 

Anyway. I've been here a handful of times and the girls working have always been super nice. The food has been pretty dope and the coffee rules. My only complaint is that there's this dingy-ass pigeon that lives outside and hovers around you while you eat, but nbd, I just hate birds."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great hours, awesome location and good coffee. :-) The crepes are a great late snack and plenty filling....could be slightly better prepared. Overall, loved this place!"}
{"text":"The coffee is always fresh and amazing. I ordered a loaded fries and they were piping hot and super tasty with some kick. My husband got the iced Americano and he loves it. The atmosphere is super chill and the staff is really friendly and helpful. They also have a little nook towards the back of the shop where they have ice cream. 10/10 recommend you check this place out."}
{"text":"Roomie wanted to check this place out but I was skeptical coz you know.... crepes at 8pm on a weekday...summer's coming up haha need to start eating better...but you know what...what the heck! food = happiness.

Anyways this is located in DTWN Phoenix and it's in one of those old houses so it already has that cool vibe. Inside was pretty much a cozy coffeeshop and out side has lights and picnic tables to hangout.

The guys at the register were super nice and was very patient when we were figuring out what we wanted. I ended up getting a Banana Nutella Crepe, sister ordered Strawberry Nutella Crepe and friend ordered one with Berry Jam and citrus and Ricotta. Plus to share we got chili cheese fries (no meat chili- they actually used hatch chili)

So everything was great!! The crepes were good, but for me I usually can't finish a whole crepe without getting too sweeted out, this time I enjoyed every bite!...all thanks to the chili cheese fries! OMG those fries where so good! I was so happy I got them. They were crispy and not greasy...those hatch chili were great definitely better than regular chili sauce. 

Anyways...very happy with this experience. Definitely want to come back here for those fries!"}
{"text":"Tried it again, much friendlier. Chai was delicious, and a good place to read a book and hang out."}
{"text":"Amazing crepes. Had the strawberry nutella and tasted really well. Nice seating area, friendly staff. Awesome experience overall. One of the best"}
{"text":"Jobot has an awesome atmosphere. The coffee in my opinion is a little overpriced. For a medium iced coffee is about 5 dollars. The food is pretty good. Id recommend Jobot to any looking to grab a coffee and hang out at a coffee shop!"}
{"text":"Espresso was mediocre at best. Started somewhat acrid, and finished ashy. This is based off a few visits (espresso can be finicky and I want to be fair), and Jobot consistently disappointed. (Which is a shame--the baristas seemed delightful)

Central Phoenix has a rapidly expanding coffee scene. There's roughly five places within a mile of Jobot (some literally a block away) with greatly superior coffee. If you want a chill bar with pleasant baristas and a decent beer selection, Jobot's for you. If high quality coffee is your main concern, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just getting the feel of this place. I love the big open yard for drinking coffee around the picnic tables. The service is always great and the loose leaf teas are fresh and very tasty. Very cool place to hang out."}
{"text":"5 star burrito. 1 star joint. Staff have pretty lame attitudes. I'm pretty cool but still got judged by the ultra elite staff. Guess I'm not hip enough to sit on their shitty thrift store sofas."}
{"text":"The crepes here are the best, the coffee is damn good, it's right on 5th downtown, artsy, conveniently open late at night, what is there not to like? Walking into JoBot is like walking into an art gallery on First Friday, plus you can get wired on caffeine and and carb overload on heaven. :)"}
{"text":"I love this straightforward, no nonsense approach to GOOD coffee. The neighborhood/location can't be beat if you're looking for a hip and casual spot to sip your latte. The prices seem right in the same range as all my other favorite coffee houses in town, and I love the next door art gallery where you can sit down with your brew. 
I've been to JoBot a couple of times, both in November, when it was a fairly new place, and the service seemed a little bit strained. Like, maybe I wasn't enough of a regular to receive the welcoming happy help that the other patrons at the bar were getting. Regardless, I would return to see how things have progressed in the last few months, and try out the patio.
I haven't been in Phoenix long, but sitting in that side room of this renovated house, with open windows and curtains blowing in the breeze, that is what I imagined I was moving West for."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh...the crepes...THE CREPES!!!

Look for a small dilapidated shack with letters that look like broken neon, and you've found it. But for every ounce of wear and tear and hipster flair this place has, you will rack up an additional value in TASTE.  Plus, this deliciousity is available 24/7, one of the few late-night options downtown.

Grab a menu off of the door (no it's not closed; you have to put some FORCE into opening that front door--but be careful in case someone is standing on the other side) and get in line.  You can sit up at the counter or just walk right up to the counter.

Order your crepes by their numbers--if you're picky, this staff will actually create a new combo for you.  Too cool not to have the latest tech? Log into square and say \"[Insert name here] is ready to pay\" and they'll send you your ticket to pay, sign, and tip from the comfort of your phone.  $7 will get you a delicious brunch-sized crepe and $2-3 will get you the fanciest coffee you want with 4 varieties of super-trendy healthy sweeteners at the bar.

If you want to sit down, head to one of the cozy tables by the windows or farther back by the piano. Don't piss off a local by taking an outlet-facing table unless you have to.  The staff is really good surprisingly about remembering names/faces, so my food almost always gets to me quickly.

Not in the mood for random screenplay writing or local music?  Ask for your order to go, but remember to specify if you want a box, because the crepes are traditionally loaded in individual cups and then in a cupholder for easy portability.

Are you there on the weekend?  Then why are you complaining about waiting 15 minutes?  These are custom made crepes!  Enjoy the local art posted around the place, or sit outside in the sunshine until your order is done. You'll forgive them their slowness by the time your first bite is in your mouth."}
{"text":"Good breakfast and coffee.  Hippy crowd, busy spot.  Tight on seating.  Would go there but not bring my tweener children next time."}
{"text":"It was a great pause when I looked at those stars for rating. Today would count as \"as good as it gets\", so I'll go with the 5 stars.

I'm not a coffee maven, I'm not an urbanista, I find that people like to meet over coffee and so I generally go with it, but I'm fine with the press stuff I make at home.

Well, until now.

I'll make it short. I really really loved my latte, I have little to compare it to, but whatever it compares to others I enjoyed the heck out of it. It was like foam coffee ambrosia.

They have crepes. I'd been hearing love poems written to their crepes by picky people, so I decided against making my own breakfast today and had their crepe THAT SHOULD BE NAMED MONTE CRISTO. Has all the correct parts; smoked turkey,melted cheese, a fried to perfection egg and crepe instead of French Toast, dusted with powdered sugar, raspberry jam on the side.

Okay JoBot, I can see how cutesy pootsey names might not be part of your business strategy, but damn man, give that crepe a name and make part sound like \"Monte Cristo\" and you'll find us folks who pine for a good MC will be giddy about what y'all can do for crepes.

I'll be back to name all the others I saw on the board and coveted, too. Rest assured."}
{"text":"Jobot is a pretty cool place. I dig coffee houses for meetings and hanging out with friends because of the laid back vibe. However, I only really drink iced coffee and have never gotten into any kind of hot coffee type drinks, teas, etc. Regardless of that though, Jobot has awesome crepes! With chorizo. They - are - amazing! Like whoa. Also, I always get orange juice here. Its great in a nice big glass with ice in it and I can sit and drink on their nice big patio during the day and its pretty much heaven. They take cash and credit using Square, so I like that I dont have to carry around cash. It has a great local flavor and vibe to it. Aside from having an annoying experience with a chatty homeless person which are kind of epidemic in downtown Phoenix and Tempe, everytime Ive been here has been great. If there's a line, you may have to wait a few minutes since they usually only have one server/cashier but worth checking out since its right off Roosevelt Row next to the Lost Leaf."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, I practically live here and therefore have nothing but good things to say. The coffee is the best in Phoenix! It's what got me hooked. The Toddy is top notch, very smooth, unlike a lot of other places *cough Starbucks cough cough* near by.
I personally really like all the HIPSTERS, which seems to be the biggest complaint on Yelp. I don't entirely understand why people don't like being around hipsters and artists that's the point of being downtown! That's also what Jobot is built off of, right? Hipster-ass art. I could go on a whole rant about how the people created a culture and what not but for the sake of the review, I won't. (But they totally did so don't talk down on hipsters!) 
Also I really love the BARISTAS and the CHEFS. Gonna throw out some names and say that KJ and Simon are the nicest people to ever live and serve and the owner and his wife, John and Crystal, are extremely involved in the community and will be always be seen with family and friends.
Now onto the FOOD! Everything is better with chorizo, which is lucky for me because everything has chorizo (want to be veggie instead? Get black beans!) The burrito somewhat reminds me of Chipotle, if they were, actually a Mexican restaurant, so it's great! You can also get dessert crepes here with everyone's favorite spread, Nutella! Or ya know, you could go to Melt. down the sidewalk for some fancy takeout rose ice cream."}
{"text":"I adore JoBot mainly for the building. The converted house and neighborhood feeling is so cute. Whenever we visit Arizona we often find ourselves back at JoBot to meet with friends. 

Upon walking up to the house, there were at least six people scattered across the front lawn with bright blue hair. It's that kind of crowd.

The savory crêpes are fairly good. The chorizo and egg is my preferred order.

The service was kind of weird on our last visit, but thankfully the food and drinks are consistent. 

The guy at the counter was initially nice and let our large group take plenty of time to look over the menu and order. We all ordered and then asked him where we should wait for the food since we were in the way of the staff and bathroom entrance. There was no space for us indoors. He told us we could wait outside and get a table so we did.

He shortly arrived with our crêpes. However, he didn't bring us any silverware. We don't eat crêpes with our hands unless they are served in paper to go cones. We aren't animals! lol 

He also didn't bring any of the coffee drinks out. He just quickly shoved the crêpes onto the splintery picnic table and started to walk away. We stopped him and asked if the iced coffees were also ready and he indifferently told us to go get them ourselves from the indoor counter. Being half served was really strange. Either bring out everything we need or politely ask us to come inside and pick up all our food and drinks from the counter. Weird, just like the crowd."}
{"text":"Their iced mocha is already enough reason for coming  back here. Its perfectly done, not too sweet with a generous amount of coffee (not watered down). Their ham and jalapeno scramble earns them 5 stars"}
{"text":"Went here with the intentions to grab something to eat and work on the computer for a couple hours. I was sadly let down and didn't care for the food or atmosphere. Even if I intended to just grab a drink It was way to dark and the music was terrible. I never tried thier old spot but wish OSB was still in that location."}
{"text":"Wonderful way to start the morning!  Friendly staff and the food is amazing!! Can't wait to come back for more."}
{"text":"I support local, independent, small businesses.  I also really like coffee, and I appreciate the art of making it.  It's a bummer that this cool place with decent food has probably the RUDEST employees in Phoenix.  I come from Santa Fe and Portland. I'm used to hipsters that like being rude and people that feel entitled, but is it really worth it?  You are trying to run a business.

There's one employee who is nice, blonde, cool lady, kills the barista station.  But then there's the other employees.  I really wanted to like this place.  But the \"I'm too cool\" to be friendly or say hello thing is really lame.  I'm giving you my money for your mediocre coffee, so maybe you should learn how to be friendly.  

I'm a hipster too, and guess what, I can say hello and treat people with respect.  It's not that hard.  I will spend my money at one of the many other coffee shops in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Took the kids here for breakfast on a Sunday morning. The savory and sweet crepes we tried were delicious. Very good lattes. Enjoyed outdoor picnic tables, and walked around the neighborhood afterward. Wish we lived closer!"}
{"text":"I'm in my 50s so could not care less about hanging with the hip crowd, but I have to say the customers were friendly.  The counter guy was a bit on the quiet side but not unfriendly.  More important, I had a great piece of quiche and an enjoyable iced latte.  The ambiance was cool.  It was nice to go to a offbeat unique spot that is also dog friendly."}
{"text":"Their food is Ok but their service is deplorable. Waiting in line for 10 minutes when they aren't busy followed by the automatic prompt of how much tip should you leave. I left none. Tips are for good service not crappy service."}
{"text":"Unf! Their hot mocha is a delicious punch in the stomach, and so ludicrously reasonably priced that I had a hard time cutting myself off. I've found myself daydreaming about their steamed milk. I also had the banana & nutella crepes - pretty good, though it felt like it could've used a little somethin' somethin' to ramp it up (a tiny sprinkling of cinnamon, maybe?). So good, though. So good."}
{"text":"I love this cute little hole in the wall. Is that what this is? Idk but it's a great study cafe/bar with food that is very good! Several vegan options. The staff is friendly and the spot itself is cool and laid back. I've never seen it not busy but people get in and out pretty quickly. Good people watching, too, just grab a seat in the corner and hide behind your laptop pretending to be doing work--just kidding?"}
{"text":"excellent place to get a cup of coffee, chat with a friend, or work."}
{"text":"In the land of big box retailers and urban sprawl, the little bungalow that houses JoBot Coffee was a welcome surprise. 

The barista was super friendly and turned out some good coffee. I could see spending time at JoBot if I lived in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite coffee shop in town. They used to be located inside the Conspire art collective but have now moved into the old Hood Rides digs up the block and it's awesome.

Plenty of seating room at the bar and also a really cool little room next door  where you can pull up a seat and hang out. From what I understand there will be seating outside too.

Most importantly however is the coffee. They use a special mix roasted specially by Cartel. I'll be the first to admit I'm no coffee connoisseur but I do know this, every drink I've had, no matter who's behind the bar has been perfect. Not burnt, not too sweet, and not a hint of pretentiousness.

Sooooo, why go to S-word Bucks when you can get a better cup of coffee up the street. Oh and for those of us who burn the midnight oil on more than a few occasions, they're open until 12am EVERY night."}
{"text":"JoBot is the real deal. Outstanding coffee, crepes and the service is first rate. I went to JoBot on a Thursday night, meeting someone special there. Walking in, there is a long corridor, with a coffee bar and stools lining the length of the bar.

I ordered an iced vanilla latte, and my partner in crime had water and a banana nutella crepe. Our drinks and crepe arrived, and the reviews saying how great everything is, are really accurate. As it slowed down a bit, the amazing employee, Shane, asked us how we were doing, and we told him how great everything was. This spawned a great conversation where we learned a ton about JoBot, and coffee in general. Shane was so cool, and he taught us about the most popular items at JoBot, specifically a toddy. We had never had one, and Shane was nice enough to make a small sample drink for us, and it was unreal. SOOOOOOOO tasty and nice, but not as great as the service and conversation with Shane.

Another super cool thing about JoBot, is that they have late hours EVERY day, so when you need a drink, snack, or tasty crepe, you have a spot to get your fix. Being at JoBot, you can easily have the feeling that you are on vacation somewhere really cool, and this is one of those places that you only wish you had back in your hometown. It sounds weird, but being at JoBot feels like a vacation, it's just relaxing, you're not rushed, and it's very laid back. The great news is, we have JoBot in our backyard, and I can take a mini-vacation anytime, and go there and relax. I am really grateful that we have locally owned gems like this in the 602. I really cannot imagine a situation where I would pick a chain over JoBot, Lola, or Giant Coffee. It's really nice to have a great drink, while supporting local Mom & Pops. That is what I call a win-win. Check out JoBot, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome! Location is lovely for it is in the middle of the heart of Phoenix where action happens! Well done, JoBot. Well done. 

I ordered the chicken quesadilla and a Chai latte. 

The quesadilla was bomb! Better than I expected! AND it had cabbage in it, which was a first for me and I must say: DELICIOUS!  It caught me by surprise how yummy it tasted. 

My Chai tea latte was lovely. I just personally wish it was sweeter and stronger and I wish they had toffee nut so I can put two squirts of that lol

Bathroom was dark, scary, and dirty. YIKES! 

The staff was extremely friendly :)

This place is cool. I'll probably return!"}
{"text":"Delicious crepes, good coffee, *excellent* hours.
Both times I've been there the service has been fine and delightfully-unStarbucksy (by which I mean humans work there, not robots)."}
{"text":"I love this little street in Phoenix dubbed as the \"Artsy District\" by my friend who lives there. I walked in to this house that's turned in to the JoBot cafe/coffee house vibrantly playing Beats Antique and related tracks. I was instantly in love!!! I got a banana and nutella crepe to go which they wrapped up like a roti in a cup. I grabbed a few forks and knives on my way out and went to town - damn was it good. Top 5 crepes I've ever had in my entire life.

5 Yelps for the location, environment, one of the 5 best crepes ever, attitude, friendliness and hipster vibe. Fantastic - my only complaint is that it took 15 minutes to make me a crepe?

THIS has been a review by Gaurav"}
{"text":"Crepes to die for!  Coffee made in house is amazing.. They have like 6 different teas.  Decor is in an old house, like the rest of Roosevelt Row area.

Def recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Late night munchies....Got the Starwberries,Nutella and Bananas crapes  and Vegan Salad. Salad was so delicious. Crapes was decent. Not bad.  Open til midnight and 24hrs on the weekend! Yay"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place in a whim for breakfast and my friend and I both got the sweet crepe with strawberries and nutella. For someone like me who normally isn't a big fan of crepes, I really enjoyed it. It wasn't burnt at all. The crepe was so soft and not too sweet. The warm nutella was delicious. I do wish that they would expand more their breakfast selection. I would come again."}
{"text":"Eww I will never go late night here for coffee. I was even scared to use the bathroom here. There are people hanging outside of the coffee house in the late night which makes it look ghetto. The inside is gross too, I would def get my late night coffee here to go. On the plus side this place is open later than starbucks."}
{"text":"Hahahha they have a sign on the door saying \"Not Jobot\" which was hilarious and confusing at the same time, their way of being funny. I actually did think for second before I entered. Hahahha. Super cool vibe and decor, the crowd seemed young and fun. It is in the art district after all. I had the latte, smooth and good. Also, the coffee was full bodied and smooth. Nice!"}
{"text":"I stopped in Sunday afternoon for a late lunch & was pleasantly surprised. First if you can snag a space in the garage, it's 2 hours free parking. I love the high chair seating in over 2/3 of the restaurant. There are great street views from inside & outdoor seating, but in this 95 degree heat, it's to hot outdoors. I ordered the Yellow Curry Chicken with a side of home fries & chicken breast with a blueberry donut. The marinade & coconut milk really create a healthy & fantastic tasting meal highlighted by the steamed rice. The chicken was perfectly grilled, not dry at all. Home fires perfectly prepared and piping hot. They provide very sturdy to go boxes. Prices are very reasonable & the venue is very clean. Special note to the immaculate bathrooms, (with cool lighting) the staff does a wonderful job. They are extremely knowledgeable & professional. They have a robust wi-fi going on plus numerous power outlets. There many customers working in this place?"}
{"text":"Jobot has become my go-to coffee-fix when ever I'm downtown. The iced toddy is the perfect fix, macchiato was precisely what I remembered a macchiato is supposed to be (thanks San Francisco for ruining me for anything less than excellent coffee)... & OMG the crepes! Try 'em all! Sweet/Savory, they're all delicious & quantifiable sized. Wonderful urban/hipster vibe, even my Mom liked it, good place for a hang out w/ friends, dates even (check out the other local art scenes while you're there), good, chill, laid-back place ;) Not to forget, also, Friday & Saturday, open all night! Now that it's fall, Sunday breakfasts are on, waffles & everything!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but unfortunately, I can't even get a coffee here. I don't eat or drink sugar, so I opt for the sugar free sweeteners when I order coffee. This place, \"doesn't believe in sugar free sweeteners\" so they only have things like honey and other natural SUGAR. Looks like I won't be going here."}
{"text":"Good tea here, you can really taste the strength of the mint leaf. Great atmosphere, remind me of Silverlake back home in Los Angeles and this up and coming downtown Phoenix.

Crepes are made good too, good music. I feel like I am at home, literally it's a cooler historic home converted."}
{"text":"Coworkers' favorite lunch meeting spot. Picnic tables and crepes make for a very relaxed atmosphere. Still working our way thru the menu, but so far we love everything we've tried."}
{"text":"don't bother.

the employees are the worst. 

it's quite sad actually because the espresso drinks are out of this world, amazing. still, i won't be back. ever."}
{"text":"Coffe was decent.  I think their major attraction is the funkiness that they provide.  Fan of funk :)"}
{"text":"Wow, worse service ever!  My girlfriend and I went there on Sunday morning. We traditionally frequent different coffee shops during the weekend and looked forward to their good coffee and crepes. I love the screen door and intimate feel of the place, so relaxing.

So we arrived and sat down, only to wait for 15 minutes (not an exaggeration) before we decided to leave. The barista didn't even acknowledge us until half way through that time. It would be different if it was screaming busy  but there was only two other couples sitting down ahead of us. I spend alot of time in coffee shops, this place may have good coffee but compared to service at Lux and Lola's; I'll take my business elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"This used to be the best in town for a crepe. In fact, it used to be one of the best places in town period. While the coffee is still good, the menu changes have turned the food from fantastic to barely edible. I have been a weekly customer from the beginning.

My two favorite menu items were the D crepe (peanut butter & chocolate chip), and savory crepe #5 (pit smoked ham, swiss, honey dijon, & spinach). The D crepe has been removed from the new menu, and crepe #5's ham has been replaced with salty deli meat ham that tastes like cardboard. Also the crepe now has kale instead of spinach, which tastes like fibrous tooth floss. Oh, and there was a random egg thrown on top-- surprise!!

From what I can tell the new menu is an attempt to streamline the shop with a more \"on the go\" style menu. There is also a new cooler filled with soda and water, which I'm sure no one will ever use. Isn't it a coffee shop? Furthermore, the downsized menu has consolidated ingredients which are all much lower quality than before- surely to lower the food cost.

The end result? Cardboard crepes and drastically downsized menu featuring Oscar Meyer quality meat. I'm sad to say I will never be returning to what was once truly a Phoenix gem."}
{"text":"Showed up this Sunday and there was a dj playing some easy techno beats that even my mother could enjoy. Very pet friendly and our newborn enjoyed the sound levels as she slept through our late morning pick me up"}
{"text":"There are only a few breakfast places in downtown Phoenix so when people talk about breakfast/brunch I think they tend to want to believe that the places down here are acceptable. I am wise to the game though, I understand that it is out of necessity that people support these places because otherwise, what are we gonna do? Not eat breakfast? This is not an option obviously. 

JoBot does a lot of things, each time I walk by there is something different going on and this is great. It should be no surprise that you will probably experience hipster-service here (blaring rap music inside at 8am, cold looks of disdian etc...). It is a universal fact that the coffee is terrible (before you attempt to refute this, walk down Roosevelt and take a random poll, I guarantee that 9/10 people will agree) It is almost the mantra of JoBot. I remember years ago stepping in here for a shot of espresso after a first-friday and being so underwhelmed that I didn't return for 4 years.

Recently I walked over to eat breakfast here, I paid 13$ for 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, 1 pancake and 1 glass of orange juice. It was OK, nothing special, I felt really let-down. I'm definitely open to spending some more time and money as it is a nice little place in the neighborhood but I will never eat breakfast here again."}
{"text":"I ordered the Jobot special sandwich which was great.  The atmosphere is hype, the music is loud (not the best place to focus) and it was busy on a Monday night."}
{"text":"Cool place. Great coffee. Only thing I would change is the staff. They almost seem snobby or just don't really really care about making people happy. Other than that cool environment delicious coffee and green tea with munt."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch a week ago.  The food is great (though none too abundant).  The coffee is also very good.  The service was definitely sub-par.  I'm very patient when it comes to a mess up here or there, but after  notifying them three times (yes, 3!) over the course of an hour after we placed our order that we thought our order might have gotten lost, we were informed that the kitchen had still not gotten our order.  It was very frustrating to see people eating next to us who had arrived a half hour after us while we were still waiting for our food.

The staff seemed like very nice people, but they *really* dropped the ball with us.  We were a party of three and by way of apology they gave my one friend a $10 gift certificate.  I'm glad they were kind enough to give him that, but this reviewer certainly left without any reason to give them a second chance for the hour of starvation and precious wasted time."}
{"text":"Cold brew coffee was amazing. The breakfast burrito was awesome."}
{"text":"I have jobot coffee 4/5 stars only because I absolutely loved the original jobot. The original jobot coffee house was located nearby in a unique house full of personality. Jobot has recently moved down the road and is located on the bottom floor of a condo complex. Still a cools building, coffee is good- food was tasty. It's just not the same!"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere! It's like a hipster took over grandmas house for the weekend. Good music, great seating by the fireplace. I only tried their chai because it was late. It was good, had a good spice. It wasn't a sweeter chai, but still worth it since it is made completely in house.

I didn't try the coffee, but when the barista would refill the grinder's hopper with beans I could smell the roast, which was delightful. 

Again, I can't get over the atmosphere. It's a cozy, yet also creative. I'd like to come back during the day and order some food and sit on the patio."}
{"text":"I love coming into JoBot for coffee on first Fridays or whenever we are in area.  The employees that worked there are always really friendly and they have a great variety of coffee and crepes.  

JoBot is in a really cool old house in downtown phoenix.  They have a couple of chairs inside and tables outside the shop.  I hear that they have awesome crepes too.  One of these days I will try one. My favorite thing to drink here is just the plan coffee.  The reason why is because the coffee is always fresh. 

If you ever downtown for first Fridays you should head over to JoBot and have some coffee and Crepes."}
{"text":"Mainly I like the hours here.  The people that work here are usually pretty nice.  The guy with beard and the leather jacket especially.  Occasionally someone will come off a little rude or snobby, but it's definitely not the norm. Also occasionally the music is too hard or too loud.  I sound like a boring old man when I say that , but 9 times out of 10 I go to a coffee shop to relax and work on something. Overall this is a nice locally owned place"}
{"text":"The coffee is decent. The cappuccino is really good! But I won't be back. We've been there a hand full of times and every time I have been there the barista- same one - has been on the unfriendly side. The first couple of times I thought maybe she was having a rough day. That's definitely not the case. She's just rude."}
{"text":"the rustic setting of this craftsman bungalow on 5th street acts as a cozy destination in the Roosevelt district. Upon walking up the steps and into the house amidst the sounds of folkesque alt. music wafting out to the street, you know this is a real indie kinda coffee shop/creperie. The crepes served at JoBot are delish with around 10 savories and almost the same number with the sweets. With a wide variety on their menu, a great selection of hot bevvies, some hansen natural soda types as well as a good selection of jarritos, this is a good place to stop by, sit back, eat a crepe and either have a hot drink during an odd cold night in Phoenix or sip a refreshing jarrito to recover from the hot summer day.Recommendations are the #8 machaca pulled pork, and the #9 root beer pulled pork for the savory and the go to banana with nutella for the sweet. So, if you find yourself close to JoBot and are craving a crepe, stop by because it's worth the calories and the yum factor. Open late nights weeknights, and 24 hours Fridays, Saturdays."}
{"text":"I'm giving this such a high rating because of the coffee. While they don't put the ingredients in (you add the cream and sugar yourself) it's just absolutely amazing. The best ice coffee I've had in the greater Phoenix area.

Seriously I feel really badly about it, like they are cheating and they are giving me something that resembles coffee but is somehow 10 times better!

It's delicious and the whole place has a whole \"Stay here and type on your laptop\" sort of vibe... Just a wonderful spot."}
{"text":"Pros:
Good crepes
Prime location along the Roosevelt Arts District
Good place to study or meet up with friends
Fun people-watching

Cons:
Feels a bit more hippie than hipster
I have gotten weird looks from staff and never a smile
The house looks/feels a bit dingy and grimy, which results in me not wanting to imbibe in drinks/food made in such a place. Cleanliness is important to me."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to study and just go for some food. It has a nice view of the street and the environment is welcoming. I tried the black bean spread crepe with pesto which was really good. Their cold brew coffee is ok, and could be a little bit more flavorful. Maybe ask for light ice if you like a more flavorful coffee."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I've taken so long to get around to reviewing JoBot. Maybe it's because I don't want you to know how amazing it is. They make the best coffee in CenPho and their crepes are to die for. But don't go here, seriously."}
{"text":"Hands down best BLT ive ever had. It was amazing! Chef Casey is a BAMF! Their coffee is on point too.

*Phoenix Foodies Approved!"}
{"text":"Ask anyone who truly knows the Roosevelt Row neighborhood, and chances are John Sagasta's name will come up.  With good reason.  Sagasta is one of the die hards.  One of those who saw the neighborhood's potential and took a chance on opening up a slew of different small businesses when plenty of people undoubtedly thought he was nuts to do so.  Among his first offerings was Jobot on 5th Street.  A long time and wildly popular staple in the neighborhood, it sadly closed around Christmas time in 2016 due to the landlord having other plans for the space.  Not even a week later however, Sagasta has brought Jobot back (albeit at a new address).  The morning after their big grand reopening, I decided to check out their new space and grab some breakfast.

Jobot took over a space formerly occupied by another popular Downtown coffee spot called Oliver's Sophisticated Bean.  Oliver's abruptly closed just after Christmas 2016, giving Sagasta the opportunity to swoop in and save Jobot from oblivion.  Jobot's opening on First Friday was a mob scene so I opted to wait to give their new place a try until morning.  If you'd spent any amount of time at Oliver's in the past, you could be forgiven for thinking the space hadn't really changed all that much since Jobot took over.  You can tell that Sagasta and his staff pretty much scrambled to get this place open quickly as there's still a lot of work to be done.  The old Oliver's signage is still all over the building and some of the Jobot furniture and decor is still being moved around (often mismatched with the old Oliver's setup).  Let's just say the new location is a work in progress.

I was the first customer of the day on Saturday morning.  Everytime I've been to Jobot in the past, it was the crepes that had my undivided attention.  I think I've pretty much had all of their crepe varieties at least once (and they're all delicious).  However today, I opted for a different route.  Today it was the Jo-Mama Breakfast Sandwich that spoke to me.  Egg, ham, cheddar cheese, tomato, avocado, spinach, and what I believe was honey mustard sauce all on an english muffin.  Came with a side potato cake.  Total cost plus a water was $9.  Dynamite sandwich and as messy as you'd expect.  Love the sauce on this thing.  And for those who might've partied a little too hard on First Friday, a perfect hangover cure.

The food menu, much like the new location is a work in progress as many of their old standby items weren't available yet as of this review.  For those nostalgic for the feel of Jobot's old location in the old row house on 5th Street, the new location will be something of an acquired taste.  The new space is set in what is arguably now Roosevelt Row's most gentrified corner with new development popping up everywhere.  But if there's one thing Sagasta brings to the table that other Downtown business owners might lack, it's credibility.  The credibility to see an idea through and invest the blood, sweat and tears necessary to make a concept work.  Sagasta did just that with Lost Leaf, Melt, Flowers Beer Wine Deli, and now he's at it again with Jobot.  With time, I'm quite certain Jobot will truly make this new spot their own."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place as it was in walking distance from where we parked and we did not have time to wait an hour for Matt's Big Breakfast. I was a little nervous as we walked down the streets to get there since the neighborhood was a bit sketchy and my mom and step-father aren't very adventurous people.  

Jobot is housed in an old craftsman house. Kinda strange to first walk in but the friendly staff makes all doubts disappear. You have the option to get any combination served in a crepe, on a salad, or in 3 corn tortillas like tacos. The menu was limited but once reading over it you realize that there is something for  everyone. 

 I ordered the peanut butter, raspberry jam, and banana crepe (which was amazing and the perfect amount of PB), while my boyfriend & step-father had The Rancher in a crepe, and my mom ordered the Monte Cristo as tacos. Everyone cleaned their plates! The kitchen welcome substitutions, there was outside seating, their OJ was to die for, and they even had Martinelli's apple juice.

We left happy & full - a perfect combination."}
{"text":"Not loving the new location. Food is still good but they don't have same vibe or quality. Still good to support a local."}
{"text":"Lovely artsy spot. Right next door to Lost Leaf.
Probably the best coffee in Phoenix. 
Solid espresso."}
{"text":"The Songbird Coffee & Tea House (SCTH) sits directly on Roosevelt Street sharing such distinction with two other coffee shops namely, Tammie Coe Cakes and Lola's Coffee (just off, Red Hut Coffee, JoBot Coffee, and Fair Trade Cafe). SCTH shares a space with with an art gallery and leather works manufacturing space. SCTH has a large window front facing the road (like Lola's) where you can perch and ponder passing traffic and gaze at the Phx downtown skyline, to include the Valley Ho. (Matt's Big Breakfast's FORMER location had a similar such lovely view...no longer.) SCTH carries baked goods from a favorite local bakery and each time I visit, other patrons make a point of extolling the degree to which they enjoy their own purchase.

Today I had a Cortado (see the posted pic). My first Cortado was served by Sam, of the (now known as Demi Coffee) Mud Dauber Coffee Shop on 16th St at The Hive. I now head out towards the downtown Phoenix farmers market."}
{"text":"Always a perfect.time to come. Never too busy and always delicious food and drinks at hand. Peaceful and wonderful. Plain and simple."}
{"text":"-Root beer pulled pork, jalapeno-cilantro slaw with fresh pineapple crepe

It already got me at ROOT BEER pulled pork...but the jalapenos really got Jal-Up-En-O tastebuds because the heat was the real deal! (Don't forget to use their home-made salsa.)

This crepe was truly the perfect combo of fruity heat because the jalapeno and pineapple balanced each other out.  Sip on some unsweetened iced tea and cut up that next bite of heat!

If you're in downtown Phoenix and you're looking for a non-touristy spot, check this out! ESPECIALLY if you are near Roosevelt Street, where all the art is. The host was also helpful with making suggestions....even told me about FREE MUSEUM WEDNESDAY at the Phoenix Art Museum and the Heard Museum."}
{"text":"If you're averse to hipsters, you might as well look away from this review right now.  JoBot is easily the most hipster joint I've been to downtown.  The customers, the staff, hipsters everywhere.  I've lived downtown for over a year now so I'm used to seeing them around.  And being that JoBot is located right in the heart of the super artsy Roosevelt Row, it should probably come as no surprise that you would see that type of crowd here.  Not only am I not a hipster, I don't drink coffee.  So what am I doing here for breakfast on a Sunday morning you ask?  One word.  Crepes.

Just south of Roosevelt on 5th Street, JoBot Coffee occupies one of a number of old historic homes that have been converted to a number of different uses.  Melt turned a house into an ice cream parlor, Lost Leaf turned a house into an art gallery/bar with an impressive craft beer selection, while JoBot went the coffee house route.  JoBot has a nice roomy patio outside that can seat plenty, though during the summer its probably not ideal (even with the umbrellas).  Inside its fairly small, but comfortable as they do a good job keeping it cool in there.  Here you order your food and drink at the counter, then grab a seat wherever (similar to Vovomeena's breakfast setup).

As I said earlier, I came to try out the crepes.  I went with Crepe F (cinnamon, apple, & granola drizzled with honey).  I also got Scramble 2 (an egg scramble with chorizo, mozzarella, & spinach).  The scramble came with a tortilla and some wicked hot salsa in case you wanna make a burrito out of it.  Also got an OJ to wash it all down.  Total price was about $15.  The crepe was absolutely awesome.  Fluffy and light while the apple and honey paired beautifully with the house made granola.  Lots of different flavors going on with this one and all of them delicious.  The scramble was also impressive.  I'm not a huge spinach guy, but mixed in with the chorizo gave the scramble a nice gentle texture and there was no shortage of cheese.  The salsa was crazy hot so i didn't mix too much of that in there, and the scramble tasted great on its own anyway.  After all was said and done, I was full and happy.  Excellent breakfast to start my Sunday.

One thing that really sets this place apart from other downtown eateries is they're open around the clock on the weekends.  This is something Downtown Phoenix could use a lot more of.  And yet despite this, the place was pretty clean and orderly and the service I received was friendly and attentive (unlike Denny's and some fast food joints I've been to at early hours).

So make jokes about hipsters if you must, but from my experience, the breakfast here is legit.  Great flavors, fresh tasting ingredients, and locally sourced.  A nice laid back neighborhood haunt.  They also have lunch and dinner items too which I will be sure try next time I'm here.  And yes, they even have lunch & dinner crepes.  Can you tell I'm a crepe fanatic yet?"}
{"text":"When Jobot has a generator and can make your morning coffee after a construction accident knocks out all the power in your neighborhood. If that doesn't earn 5 stars I don't know what does."}
{"text":"Love it
Great coffee place. Pastries and food
The type of place Phoenix needs
Great music vibe"}
{"text":"We've all been there.  You've been drinking a little too much and the bar closes. You get hungry (I call them the drunchies) and you are willing to eat almost anything. You just want something really good. We made the mistake of coming to JoBot Coffee for Crepes.  We ordered the #1 (Braized Beef, Mozzarella, Swiss, Caramelized Onions, Bell Pepper, Peppercini) the #2 (Chorizo, Fried Egg, Mozzarella, Spinach, Salsa) and the B. (BANANA + NUTELLA + WHIP). The crepe wasn't hot even though it was made \"fresh\", everything tasted bland and it was not satisfying. Decor was great, service was great and the fact they are open 24 hours on the weekend is a huge plus! However, I'd try something better for your drunchies. For some reason, all of our stomachs hurt that day right after as well. That could just be a coincidence, I suppose."}
{"text":"If you find yourself wandering the streets of down town phoenix late one evening, no, you're probably not homeless you were likely just hopping from bar to bar and can't remember. 

Don't fret because JoBot's lights are still on late into the night. While I can't say exactly just how late \"late\" is because I haven't payed too close attention to that minor detail and no one has posted it here on yelp yet. I can say they've been open every time I have visited after 11pm.

Mental note to self, next time at JoBot find out about hours and update yelp. Is it considered a mental note if I just wrote it down? I'm also not so sure it was to self either as I plan to post this review sometime soon. 

Anyway.

Give any of their crepes a try, they're all fairly good; although, I do prefer the savory crepes over the sweet crepes here. I truly can't believe I just said that actually, since most of my other reviews are for frozen yogurt and cupcakes, at least that's what I tried to order and was told \"We don't actually serve frozen yogurt here sir. Would you like to try our crepes?\"

Loved the chorizo and egg crepe - twas the perfect combination of everything they combined together to make the crepe. I'm pretty sure it was part chorizo, part egg, part cheese and part crepe. But then again it was a late night and I did just swing by after visiting Lost Leaf next door.

I hear they serve excellent coffee too, but I tend to stick to tea and pastries. Happy wandering my yelping friends! Hope to stumble into you sometime while chowing down on one of their tasty crepes."}
{"text":"I have been to the new location a few times since it has opened and so glad it stayed in the neighborhood!  Friendly staff, cool vibe, delicious Italian sodas (my drink of choice) and tasty crepes...all the makings of a great neighborhood hangout!"}
{"text":"One of the great thing about working in the downtown area is there are some great options when you just need to get out of the office. Jobot is a great option with plenty of table space and indoor and outdoor seating. There were several of us and they have some big tables which make it easy to spread out your work. The space is industrial but comfortable. The staff is friendly and no one rushes you out the door.

I grabbed a bottled soda and a chocolate chip cookie. I also tried the peppermint mocha. I'm not a big coffee fan but it was good. I didn't order from their menu but it all looked and smelled good and was reasonably priced.

On a side note....I don't get the chair next to the toilet in the bathroom. Was someone supposed to come in with me and supervise?"}
{"text":"Is your inner hipster screeching to come out? It is clawing at you to visit a vintage-esque/non-corporate influenced establishment? Do you want to be served coffee in a non-branded cup and drink it on the lawn of a historical house nestled in the cracks of the central city? Do you want to sit with non conformists, neo hippies. \"too cool to care but I am here to be cool\" type people?

Go to Jobot and feed your hispter ego. It's cute, yummy and a nice little experience in the center of Roosevelt Row. Love the little hipster inside you. He/She needs love too :)"}
{"text":"Having read the reviews I was super psyched to try this place. I thought it would be super eclectic, but worth it. I feel it lies somewhere between 2 and 3 stars cause it was just okay. 

The place itself actually seems dirty... which messes with my clean freakness.  It looks like an old house that has not been taken care of.   

My coffee was the only thing worth talking about... which is probably a good thing because that's the specialty. 

The food was average and not very flavorful, and it took quite awhile. Was worried about how sanitary the kitchen was considering the state of  the public areas. 


eh."}
{"text":"Obviously a college hang out. Surprised it passed a health check. Food was overly salty and quite bland. Friend ordered the hungry man breakfast and got an average sized pancake, fried egg and a small size of potatoes. She kept asking for hot sauce but they only had sciracha yet wouldn't bring it out. Why was this place busy???  Lousy service and lousy food. Coffee wasn't impressive either. Music very loud and lots of smokers outside. Could not enjoy the company. Bathrooms were gross."}
{"text":"My son and I came before our last day at Comicon. He got the traditional crepe with strawberries and bananas and absolutely loved it ($7.50). Literally licked the plate. I got the breakfast burrito ($8.50, don't let the picture fool you I took it long after cutting it) it was piping hot and delicious. I'm picky about my chorizo and this one was very very tasty. Along with my $3 brunch mimosa. It was a win for us!"}
{"text":"Great iced coffee & chai late. Had breakfast on Sunday and it was outstanding. All local products. This area has many local artists and reminds me of the Haight in S F. Well worth the triip \"off the main roads\" highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!   We had a strawberry crepe and biscuits & gravy, both were amazing!"}
{"text":"What a great find in downtown Phoenix! Located on 6th st in a historic house, this little jewel serves fresh coffee, bakery items, and breakfast dishes. Their veggie egg scramble was my favorite! Nothing starts the day like veggies in the AM! Can't wait to try the rest of the menu items!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 4 stars not for the food necessarily, or the coffee ... but actually for the idea, the space and the fact that its open 24/7 on the weekends! I guess this place is pretty awesome for that, a great space to share a meal, a cup of coffee and do some work at any time you feel like it. 

Definitely a needed concept in the Bay Area where things are busier and I do find myself wanting coffee ALMOST 24/7.

I had their classic crepe, which was just lemon and sugar, but the batter I wasn't a fan of because it's way too chewy and more like ... a burrito wrap than a crepe. The flavors were just ok. The americano I had was good but it wasn't amazing. However, like I said, great place that I worked in for about 2 hours, took some meetings too!"}
{"text":"A cool post punk era coffee bar moves from a cool beat up old house on 5th Street and takes over a spot in a multi-million dollar condo complex on 3rd Street. Whats not to love? The coffee and the food rocks and the douche bags make themselves scarce."}
{"text":"The sunrise drink (espresso over oj) is really good. The basmati red lentil cake is a solid 10!"}
{"text":"First time visit and we were not disappointed...entirely. We ordered the chicken tinga crepe, pico scramble w/ side of chorizo & potato hash, and a Nutella crepe minus the banana. The crepes were delicious...the pico scramble & hash was cold so we sent it back. They returned with a plate that looked like they threw the same food into a frying plan to reheat it. NOT COOL...nor sanitary!! It was sent back again and made fresh....DELISH!! Tabitha was the bomb.com making sure the situation was rectified. So, I am only reducing by 1 star and we will definitely return. And I forgot to mention that Tabitha makes a mean iced tea."}
{"text":"By far my favorite downtown coffee spot. I head here right after all my photoshoots. The crepes are fantastic and they have the best Scones I've ever had! I'm always meeting nice people and having great conversations. If you love the classic coffee shop feel then this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Very cute little place! Food was delicious! Loved it so much we are their twice while we were in town visiting!"}
{"text":"Breakfast til midnight:  I'm there!  

My friend & I just finished listening to jazz at The Nash. So we yelped nearest coffee/food served after 10pm.  

I know!  I know!  Not gonna sleep with cold brew in my system soooo late but it sounded so good with my Chilaquiles.  And I was right on both haha!!

Chilaquiles: three eggs scrambled with hatch chile verde sauce & tortilla chips topped w/pico de gallo, cabbage & Cotija cheese with side of breakfast potatoes.  Either we were really hungry or it was really good?!? Hmmmmm must be both!!!  My friend kept eating my yummy potatoes. Both had a nice kick to it. 

Cool relaxed vibe & nice staff. People were on their laptops, playing board games or just drinking some brew (alcoholic & non) with friends. Indoor & outdoor seating. Even saw a fan outdoors for when it's warmer I believe.  We definitely enjoyed our food & drink."}
{"text":"I like the vibe here. It's an old house made café. Today my hunger led me here due to one drive by Matt's looked like I would be waiting a while to get fed. I knew from the get-go I wanted ice coffee (love my morning crack), some Yelpers said their (Toddy) was good. Next I attempted to order the (B&G) but the girl replied \"No you won't. We're are out!\" I reopen the menu and blurted out (breakfast -burrito). Paid and went to find a lid for my coffee, only over hear the kitchen yell out \"You know we're out of Pico for the burrito\". I went out on a limb and accepted it. Bad choice on my part. I felt as if my toddy was decaf and my food was par only because of the side of great salasa it was accompanied with. It was Monday tho,   I'll try you on a Friday."}
{"text":"The sweet crepe...nutella and strawberries...was just as good!  Their Italian Sodas are delicious making this a go to place in Phoenix for me!"}
{"text":"Meh, it's an OK place to meet a friend for a fresh coffee or tea. They do make the teabags by hand so that's worth a visit. It is a major hipster joint and the staff have bad attitudes, even to their regular customers. I had one of their chocolate chip and peanut butter crepes which was decent. They do make a good chai latte tea and the coffees are strong. 
In 2014 they received a bad health dept review, so there's that. Forget about sitting outside unless you chain smoke or want to sit in something sticky. No fresh air surrounds the front door or patio, just clouds of cigarette smoke. Depending on the staff, the music can suck too. 
Not my favorite place but it is a local business and I'm all about supporting them."}
{"text":"Good vibes! The coffee and crepes are delicious. I've been there to study a few times and it is always pretty quiet. You definitely get the hipster scene here. Service can be a bit better. The PA system was playing some pretty fantastic music so that is a plus. Overall great local place to enjoy some delicious coffee or beer. Most importantly try their Banana Nutella crepe. AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Decent pancakes. A bit overpriced.i wasn't really taken by the atmosphere here. Hipster."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place when I went, but it just didn't happen. I went on a nice peaceful Sunday morning to meet some friends and discuss an upcoming project we are working on. I parked my car and walked up to JoBot only to hear club  music blasting from a D.J. in the front sitting area. All I could think was, please let my friends be inside because I cannot listen to club music first thing in the A.M. I could only think how much worse it would be if I was hungover. Thank goodness my friends were inside. 

When I walked inside, I really liked the old house feel, but the place could have seriously used a good scrubbing.  It felt grimy and dingy rather than fresh and vintage.  I am a tea drinker, so I was a bit disappointed with their tea selection. It was nothing to write home about.  My friends were in the back room and as I walked over to them there was a spot in the floor I almost fell through - I'm not kidding. And I am not a heavy girl either - 115 lbs. The floor boards were stripped away and there was a thin layer of old wood between me and the crawl space. I about pissed myself when I stepped on it and felt the wood bend and start to give. Needless to say it was not the relaxing leisurely Sunday morning I had in mind."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and fast service. My friend and I got crepes and coffee and both were delicious."}
{"text":"There are some things to know about Jobot. The service is a bit relaxed and not rushed. This is not Starbucks. Thank God. The atmosphere is fantastic, the music not obtrusive, the tea wonderful. Haven't had the food yet. Check them out. Pretty sure you will love it if you're looking for a relaxed, cool spot to hang out."}
{"text":"CREPES! Wow they are all delish, and their the only place I know of close by that has them. Iv'e probably had everything on their menu by now and it's all amazing. (Im downtown often for coffee, school, and friday art walks.) And the best thing is - their always open whenever I go by. Coffee is great, lattes are super rich 
They just took out a huge main wall that separated the two rooms so now, its nice and big, and open. 
Always good. Always interesting people."}
{"text":"I come here 3-5 times a week. Not because theybtreat me well inky because I can get coffee and sometimes drinks late. Amazing how I can remember everyone who works here but they act like they have never seen be before as I tell them I come here several times weekly. Still continue to treat me pourly even though I tell them before hand my intentions. I really would like this place and I spend nealry 50$ a week here and they continue to seem like I'm not a valued customer. If only be coffee was open later I would not come her nearly ever."}
{"text":"These hard workin freaks kick ass !!
Best food and coffee anytime you want 
Never a disappointment"}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed with the iced chai latte I received. It was watery and bland. If I end up going to this cafe again, I'll probably stick to regular brewed coffee. 

Aside from that, the place itself is cool, located in a convenient place on Roosevelt Row. Looks like a chill place to study, work, or hang out at."}
{"text":"Went for their chi latte recommended by someone absolutely great. Super friendly confortable and great for vegans. Dog friendly patio and the place next door has live bands coffee and live music!"}
{"text":"this is a phoenix hipster spot they serve coffee drinks tea breakfast and lunch. this morning having jury duty i ventured into the big city and took the yelpers suggestion and tried this joint out ,its a cool old house in a neighborhood full of other cool old houses all turned into artsy type studios and retail.I had the choritzo gravey and bisquet w/2 eggs and yummy potatos the service was good and effeciente and friendly. personally i thought the biscuits were a bit dry but all in all i enjoyed myself"}
{"text":"Our first visit to JoBot and I'm happy we made the drive.  A nice location - I love when I don't have to worry if there will be enough room to sit and here there is plenty of space!  I ordered the chorizo crepe and it was amazing!  First bite and I declared that I knew I had the best dish on the table!  After testing a bite of the waffle ( get taste and texture) and the JoRito (gigantic and a really good taste) I am still sure that I won.  Best order of the morning!  I can't wait to come again!"}
{"text":"Very retro yet hipster. Nice outdoor seating. I had Crepe C. It was excellent. Nice balance of Nutella and strawberries plus their whipped cream was great! Good portion, but if you're hungry one is not enough. Prices are very appropriate. 5 stars for a quick, cool breakfast."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for breakfast on a Sunday. We arrived around 8 and were pleased to see that there were plenty of seats. We ordered and chose a seat outside. I really enjoyed my Scramble Z (eggs, cheddar, and roasted veggies). I loved the fact that they put in zucchini and eggplant as well as green peppers and onions. It was served with a delicious flour tortilla and very spicy salsa. I also ordered a classic crepe and devoured it. My husband ordered Crepe F. He said it was a little too sweet but ate the whole thing! Then he got a scone. He really liked that. Overall, it was really good, but if you are a picky eater or like a lot of options you may be disappointed by the rather small menu."}
{"text":"some of the staff is wonderful. on the other hand some of them aren't. i am tired of not being able to smile and look at my server in the eye and say \"hello\". apparently that is not ok to do with some of the staff. particularly the big dude with the pony tail. i am a pretty forgiving person and i understand we all have our bad days...but after the fourth time serving me, do you still have to be rude? one time i asked what kind of teas they have and i get the look-at-the-ceiling-rolled-eyes  and he points and says \"there they are.\" ...a few different containers of teas with labels on them which i can't read. another issue i have is that it is not always 'customer first.' if i'm standing around and don't know where to order, with a bunch of people and they don't know where to order either, help us figure it out....we are the ones ultimately PAYING your PAYCHECK. another issue is the bipolarness of some of the staff, one day the blonde chick is nice, the next she's rude. why would you be rude? i'm paying for my drink, i'm giving YOU YOUR PAYCHECK money. this is a problem that many coffee shops have, a rude staff. however, the rest of the staff is quite nice and awesome:) and really friendly. really there's only two bad eggs. if they would only be nice 95% of the time instead of 10% i would be much happier. again i am a very forgiving person so i hope that they read this and shape up."}
{"text":"I work for the Phoenix Fire Department and you will see me here almost every Saturday night. The coffee is exceptional and the customer service is alwyas nice. Its a nonpretentious douchebag place and the vibe is no corporate. Its a nice change of pace in my life and I enjoy it. You will also find me here now on random nights with my laptop watching a movie and enjoying a coffee as I am just so relaxed when I am here.

Great coffee, good atmosphere and a great addition to downtown,,"}
{"text":"Coffee, crepes and cool hipsters, You can have a taste of all there with just one stop here.

Inside of a old house is JoBot, Prices are decent service is quick and nice and the crepe did not skimp on the basil. Prices are like all coffee shops which means not a great deal but I guess you pay for the experience.

Inside are a few tables and chairs and a old upright piano. Outside are school style picnick tables which could really benefit from a back. Or maybe I am just getting too old to sit here."}
{"text":"Authentically Hippie is the best way to describe this place! I have been living in Phoenix for 2 years now and this place is still where I go to any given weeknight. Let me make this review direct and short. 

Food - awesome! lots of choices and real. 
Price - reasonable. about $8-11 for an entree and $3-5 for coffee. 
Service - polite, friendly, young and progressive! 
ambience - this place has a unique character. it being in an old house and it feels like your in a living room! great place to hang out and do some needed READING! 

Recommendation - my GO TO spot in Phoenix for sure. Try this place out especially when you are looking for a place that has character and hippie feel to it. I honestly feel like I am at Silver Lake, Los Angeles whenever I go here."}
{"text":"We decided to make our way here for Sunday brunch and try out their food. We had been here once before for an afternoon coffee and hadn't been too impressed with the coffee or atmosphere, but we wanted to give their food a try. We are so glad we did, their food is delicious! We had their biscuits and gravy, breakfast burrito with chorizo, a brown sugar and cinnamon crepe, and a pancake for our son. All were amazing and scrumptious. They are large portions and you will not leave hungry. The burrito was full of goodness and the salsa on the side was nice and spicy and a little went s long way. The biscuits and gravy were different but good. And our 7 month old loved the pancake. It was so fluffy and perfectly cooked. 
Here are the reasons they are only getting 4 stars and not five:
~Customer service was not great. I don't know if they were overwhelmed, but they had an attitude and I did not feel welcome. 
~ Coffee is not amazing. When their main product is coffee I really want to be blown away and I wasn't. The cold brew was average, it did have a lot of flavor though. Their drip. Offer was just really weak. 
~ They have a great outdoor space, but it is ruined by all the smokers."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  This place is what I consider a true coffee house.

Top three tips:

1) excellent locally roasted beans.

2) fantastic in house bakers -- amazing baked goods!!!  Best brown butter donuts ever!!!

3) the exhibit local art."}
{"text":"My friends and I made a late night stop to JoBot's for some tasty grub after a night of fun in downtown Phoenix. A charming, rustic American Craftsman Bungalow style home greeted us along with a chill, hipster, casual diner atmosphere. Biscuits and gravy are one of my top ten guilty food indulgences and I had been oogling over the menu for the last week over JoBot's chorizo with red gravy version. Most of my restaurant choices are premeditated, yes, strange, I know. Welcome to the life of a food obsessed person.  To my dismay, they were out of gravy. I defaulted to my second choice, the yummy Jo-Mama's breakfast sandwich and a tasty brown butter donut. JoBot's satisfied my late night cravings and I can't wait to come back and try their morning picker upper!"}
{"text":"Sure, it doesn't have to homey feel that the old place has, but the quality is still as good, and the place is bright and nice.
Drinks (Tea lattes...) are well done, quickly made, and there was a long line when I went one cold morning."}
{"text":"It's a nice mid century bungalow turned coffee shop.  

I've read a good review by Anthony P. more than a year ago and it's been on my list.  I didn't know it's two doors down by my fave installation art gallery, Eye Lounge.

First off, I had the hot chai latte, hubby had the regular latte and my little cutie pie a Strawberry Italian Soda.  The sitting outside had plenty of room for hanging out.  They also bring out your food.

So, people rave about the crepes and I had to find out for myself what it's all about.  We ordered the crepe banana/nutella and cinnamon apple honey (without the granola).  It was okay.  The crepe was hard and dry.  I'm more into the soft and buttery ones.  I don't think they add enough eggs and butter in there.  The fillings were delicious.  I'm not a fan of their crepes. 

We will be back for their yummy drinks!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome sauce! Got a Nutella strawberry filled crepè with a quad iced honey lavender lattè. It was all delicious! And the quaint little homey atmosphere inside gives off the prefect vibe to start your day..I will be recommending this place to all my friends and co workers!"}
{"text":"New location just in time for my trip to Phoenix. My Airbnb hosts suggested Jobot, but I saw it was closed. The location is downtown, very modern. It's huge, with tables and barstools looking onto downtown Phoenix. I got a regular drip coffee for $3 and it was huge. They have stevia, which is a plus. I didn't eat here, but they have a full kitchen. In comparison to all the coffee shops I've been to, this one is okay, but it's not one I would frequent."}
{"text":"We came here friday morning for crepes to celebrate my daughters birthday. We got the nutella/strawberry crepe, and the ricotta/citrus/berry jam crepe, they were delicious, large and had plenty of filling. My daughter wanted a caramel macchiato, and the lovely young woman who took our order suggested the caramel latte, since their macchiato was different than what starbucks has, so we ordered both. The latte was good and the macchiato looked good, in a tiny espresso cup, yet I didnt like its flavor so woulnt order again. Since it was her birthday, my daughters drink was free, and she loved the writing on the cup, which was just the drinks name, but very artistic.Great way to start her birthday! (they also had some delicious looking pastries!)"}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love! Jobot is really a great place to sit down and enjoy a coffee and of course, a crepe! They have great customer service and it's a great hang out place! My friends/family and I could sit around and talk for hours!! It's really awesome. Their crepes are my favorite along with their honey vanilla latte. I highly recommend this cute hipster spot! I can never stay away!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out based on reviews, location and well, crepes and coffee. If it sounds a little too good to be true it is because it kind of was. It is not uncommon to sometimes get weird attitude at these hipster hubs but never to the point being directly rude and feeling pushed out the door. Just a very strange experience and some mediocre crepes. Coffee was actually good but i wouldn't come back. This place was just really overrated to me."}
{"text":"This is going to be a simple update.
I still love the crepes so I'm keeping my rating the same. Finally tried their chai though. They make them with honey so it really changes the taste. Makes them way sweeter than spicy. Trying that once was enough. I want spicy."}
{"text":"The food was ok, nothing to go back for specially when I tipped the waitress that brought our food to our table and then asked us to pick up our plates after we were done and bring it to the counter so she could take it from there.  Yeah, you must order at the counter as well since the waitress won't come to your table to  take your order.  Lastly, the place is ran out of a regular house but goodness gracious get AC"}
{"text":"Cold brew was really good. I ordered the chorizo crepe and it really didn't have that much flavor. Nothing hot sauce can't fix :)"}
{"text":"If you live in or around Phoenix and you haven't been here...you should be punched in your face. 

Not your average breakfast; my chorizo biscuits and gravy was flat out delicious!! The creme fresh over the potatoes was a nice touch and helped cool the heat just enough. The spice is clearly there but not overwhelming. 

Don't let my score of four stars fool you, the food is out of this world. The space is a little cramped but the service was good."}
{"text":"Best cold brew I've ever had! Such a great little spot in the arts District - must try!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, relaxed place, indoor and outdoor seating. Loved the crepes and Italian sodas."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from this place, the service was slow, and the staff was rude. There were about 5 other people in the place when my two friends and I stopped in. It look 30 minutes for us to get our drinks. The barista called out my friend's name and when he walked up to the counter she scolded him and yelled \"that's not for you!\" Maybe ask people for an initial of their last name if you have multiple people with the same name? After we drank our drinks (we each got something different) we all became violently ill soon after, I'll spare the details on that. I know we got sick from this place because that's the only thing we had in common. We didn't eat anywhere together before or after and we each went back to our own houses afterwards. I'll never come back here again. They obviously don't clean their equipment correctly or employees aren't being sanitary."}
{"text":"This Sunday, I decided to try the biscuits and gravy. The actual biscuits and gravy were very tasty as were the potatoes, but the eggs were a bit of a miss. One was undercooked to the point that I wondered if I should eat parts of it and the other one was slightly overlooked. I know it can be difficult to cook eggs...

But try for some more consistency."}
{"text":"Neat little place, very hipster vibes, friendly staff, delicious coffee/espresso

I ordered an iced agave latte, was very tasty
For breakfast I ordered one of their Nutella banana crepes, it wasn't very special just a crepe, banana and Nutella, and I feel like they skimped on the Nutella a bit, wasn't really a good ratio between crepe Nutella and banana... I'm all about ratios. I'll be back for coffee but will try another place for my crepe"}
{"text":"I practically live here. I might end up dying here with how much mocha and curry I consume at this heavenly diner. I wish their alcoholic beverages were a bit better though. I am a cider man but they only have Schilling, which practically tastes like a very cheap beer."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on here on our first date I am just went back to celebrate Valentine's Day. We love the crepes!!"}
{"text":"So glad you didn't leave us JoBot! The staff is friendly. The food is great. It's nice, relaxed friendly atmosphere where you can grab a bit or have some coffee and get a little work done. Roosevelt Row rules!"}
{"text":"Jobot was really truly \"okay\". If you're in the area and you need a cup of coffee I would say that they give a good size coffee for their prices so it's not a waste of money per say. But, despite buying the largest size, the flavor left me wanting more. I ordered a vanilla latte, which I feel is a pretty good tell-tale drink: if it's good, chances are the rest of the coffee is. It's it's bad, chances are that everything else is too. My latte was not overly sweet but it was missing basically all the coffee flavor. It tasted of mostly milk with a hint
Of coffee and vanilla. I was pretty disappointed and I don't think I'd ever go back with so many amazing coffee shops in the vicinity that keep me coming back again and again like Lux Central and Lola Coffee."}
{"text":"Just always a great place to eat and work. The music is on point, the food is kiss-the-cook-worthy, and...did i mention that this place is open pretty much all day now?"}
{"text":"At first I was really skeptical to see that Jobot, my beloved hidden oasis away from the gentrified hell that Phoenix has become was moving into the space. But when I super missed the coffee and the salsa and seeing all of the amazing artists and makers and movers and shakers and rebels and crazies and dreamers and nerds, I know I had to give it another chance. It's not frequently that you walk into a place and feel so invested that you find yourself busing dishes that rude people just leave laying around. I'm sure they're working on expanding the menu, and I live for the breakfast burrito that they have now. The salsa is divine and their cold brew is strong and delicious. If you want quality and community, this is the place."}
{"text":"We were sitting here waiting over 20 minutes just to get a beer never got serviceso we left.they served other two people that came in 10 minutes after us. Yeah I won't be going back"}
{"text":"Tonight I had the pleasure of trying out JoBot Coffee. This trendy coffee house totally lives up to the hype for their crepes. I had the Nutella and Banana Crepe. What's not to love? It was perfect. It had just enough Nutella to give it that great hazelnut and chocolate taste. I worried that it was be caked with Nutella making it too rich to eat, but that was not the case. The bananas were great too. This was my first time at JoBot and the barista was very helpful in recommending the sweet peach tea, and the crepe. 

This place is very cool. It is an old house that was converted first into a bicycle shop and then the coffee house. One room has a living room type atmosphere, and there was ample seating outside. I will definitely go back to try the savory crepes and coffee."}
{"text":"Really Delicious breakfast sandwich. Only lost one star because it was quite pricey for the serving size. The takeaway pasta salad was good (not great) but very reasonably priced. Cool scene too."}
{"text":"Best locally owned an operated business around.  Their crepes are delicious, their staff is laid back and friendly.  They sometimes whip up brunch on the weekends and it's always delicious.  Having  a lot of food allergies, it is really awesome when servers and cooks are happy to accommodate weird/lengthy requests (no dairy/gluten).  This is the best late night/breakfast place around. 

Oh, and Brittany C... You answered to the wrong name. I was sitting next to you.  Who's fault is it when they call a name and you answer to the wrong one?  You were very rude, and totally brought down the vibe of the room."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. They didn't put espresso in my latte this time, and their food was gross both times... Not to mention all of the employees give off an elitist hippie/hipster vibe. Hate it."}
{"text":"Of course the place a few blocks away was packed. I'm so glad it was though because it lead me to look elsewhere. This place is a quiet unsuspecting diner that packs in great food, pastries, and coffee. No wait, better food, and cheap. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Yet another Phoenix home converted to business. It's unconventional, and I like that, but It's still a little surreal to think I'm eating in the same place some kid probably watched Saturday morning cartoons. It's okay though because the crepes were mighty tasty (the lemon in particular), and so was the coffee, despite my public verbal displays of affection towards Starbucks. If I'm in Phoenix again, I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I stoped by and order chilaquiles, it took more than 30 minutes to get my food so I decided to get up and see what was going on so they immediately brought my food , what a surprise, the tortillas were burned so I couldn't eat it , they offered me a refund which I didn't accept , I don't recommend this place !"}
{"text":"What a nice local coffee shop! I love the atmoshphere and being able to sit outside in the nice Phoenix sunshine with Made just next door and a cute picket fence with sunflowers growing along some of the side. It's such a fresh, free environment where you can relax with a tea or coffee and read a good book, chat with friends or work on your computer. If I lived closer I would come here all the time and just sit, relax and enjoy. 

If I were a coffee drinker this place would be perfect, but I do enjoy their tea and they have some good food to choose from. I am hoping to try the crepes."}
{"text":"I've been to jobot a couple times and the food is good. The atmosphere is pleasant. The benches outside feel like they're going to collapse and end your life, all for a thrilling dine in experience!"}
{"text":"Crepes - GREAT!
Coffee - Good
Chile cheese fries - Not good. Fries not crispy and only green chilies with a VERY LITTLE dust of Mexican crumbled cheese. I would rename this dish GREEN CHILE FRIES.
Chilaquiles - Not good. Their attempt on this typical Mexican breakfast item is quite sad. :(

I'm not gonna knock them for trying but will definitely only be back for the coffee and crepes.

If you want good authentic chilaquiles or other Mexican food breakfast specials, drive yourself to Central Ave. & I-17"}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago with friends. Breakfast was good, tea was nice, atmosphere ok. I wasn't blown away but I also wasn't disappointed. I love the location and the interior is vintage and original. The outside was ok to have breakfast and enjoy the weather. Moderately priced."}
{"text":"Stopped in during a recent vacation, I was under the impression that they served food but we saw nothing other than the coffee bar.  No one said anything when we walked in, we walked around and then walked out.... I would not go there again, though there are a couple cool murals on the buildings in the area."}
{"text":"I have been a customer of JoBot's since before the renovations, before they had a kitchen, and before they made such amazing food. The coffee has always been genuinely and truly delicious. The food, just wow. Everything I've ever had has just been awesome. The best crepe I've ever had. True chilaquiles...not commercialized. So good. I give it 4 starts instead of 5 because of the time frame it takes to get your food--it's a small kitchen so please expect to be here for awhile for your food because it is truly worth the wait. The other reason is because I have come across 2 very snooty, nose-up-in-the-air hipster baristas while coming here who just really need to bring themselves down a notch or 5. The last barista I had was a female and was very sweet. Do NOT try The Sunrise. Orange juice and espresso--just don't. Will always stop by JoBot whenever I am downtown, no question. Oh the crepes----so good!"}
{"text":"The ice coffee is SO good I drank it straight! Nuff said."}
{"text":"Ah, Jobot! How I loved your previous location, menu, and staff. Sadly you have defaulted to serving the lowest common denominator, eliminating all of your unique vegetarian options. Your coffee preparation has taken a nosedive but the cost has soared--no latte art to be found here, and the price is now $4 for an 8-ounce latte. You've broadened your beer menu and now have an extensive mixed drink list, but at the cost of forgoing the down-home atmosphere of the repurposed house you once occupied. Now the customers here come for the mimosas instead of the friendly vibe, and the staff is stretched thin so that they don't have time or desire to chat with customers like they used to. If you could bring back those awesome chilaquiles, retrain your baristas and staff, reset your prices, and try to regain the character of your prior iteration, I would return and change my review. The pros include the cleanliness of this new place and the ample seating."}
{"text":"I went to Jobot to get a growler filled. As they started filling my glass the keg blew and there was about an ounce and a half in the glass, which they gave me. But alas nothing left for my growler. 
They very nice about it but they can't sell you what they don't have! Seems like a nice friendly neighborhood spot, that I would visit more often if I was in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great place!!! Loved the workers, great energy!!! Food was great and not expensive. Definately a chill place for a meal."}
{"text":"It's an old sh!tty house in Garfield, and that's AFTER the remodel.  This place is packed with hipster kid's bikes and professionals who are on their way downtown, wanting to feel cool for drinking at the trendy coffee bar.  Coffee is nothing special and neither is their service.  Plus the art looks like it came from a 6th graders art class."}
{"text":"Some of the best crepes in Phoenix. And they're HUGE. I've tried some of their other food here as well and it's also dynamite. Of course the coffee itself is awesome, make sure you don't leave without trying their cold brew. Super smooth, no bitterness at all. This is the coffee shop you long for. The atmosphere is super relaxing and low key. On a day when it's not super hot I like to sit out on the patio."}
{"text":"I was here 7 AM on a Sunday two weeks ago.  Rudest service ever.  Despite the fact that they were hardly any customers at all, workers seemed totally disturbed by the fact they had to take a customer's order.  I ordered the strawberry-banana crepe.  When it came, the person just dropped it on my table at the coffee table and didn't bother to even look at me or say anything.  She just dropped it off liked she had better things to do, i.e. there were hardly any customers.

The two stars are for the good crepes."}
{"text":"This is a great local coffee shop in Downtown Phoenix. When I walk in, I immediately feel like I've walked into someone's welcoming home. There's seating at the counter and filled with friendly faces of local business people and eclectic folks sitting and conversing with each other, there are folks sitting on the patio enjoying the fresh air and there are individuals sitting and working in the open environment. It's a perfect place to sit, relax and do some work if you really must. The coffee's good, the food is delicious and offers a wide variety of items from breakfast and sandwiches to crepes and salads. I haven't tried the crepes yet but it's on my list and I promise to update my review when I do! I just wish I lived in this area so I could visit Jobot every morning!"}
{"text":"Jobot has been a First Friday staple for me for years now, and I've always loved their creative drinks and savory crepes. When I stopped by last week though I noticed that the menu had changed, in fact, it's been downsized drastically. The coffee is still great, but the crepe options weren't the same at all, and that's what hooked me on them in the first place. Still a decent place, but a lot less exciting now with the new menu."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere, the indoor and outdoor seating and the crepes are OUT OF THIS WORLD!!  I would give them a five except they don't have decaf coffee of any kind.  As someone who (for health reasons) has to have decaf, this one little thing will make or break a place for me.  I know most of the coffee-drinking world doesn't care, but for me it's the difference between four and five stars.  I even toyed with the idea of giving them three because of it, but I have to give kudos for being independent, supporting local arts, and everything else about the place is wonderful.  Luckily I live in SD so the loss of my coffee dollar is not a big deal.  : )  I will, however, get at least one crepe every time I can while I'm there!!"}
{"text":"The coffee here is not bad. However, the service was terrible. The barista rolled her eyes at us when we ordered an extra drink and never once smiled. She didn't greet us when we came in even though we were the only people in there. She just said, what do you want?. We were going to order food but decided not to after her attitude. The art work is cool and they have a big outdoor area."}
{"text":"This is a great coffee shop and a great center point for the neighborhood. At first I had my reservations about the place because I loved HoodRide that occupied the building before, but after so many years, I see how this establishment has made a huge contribution to the growth of the downtown community. I love that they are open 24 hours. I have stopped here after a hearty night out (and before driving home) on more than one occasion.

This place has the very best chai that I can find in AZ, maybe even the best chai that I've ever had (outside of just about any Indian household). I respect that they make their own chai blend. You can see the bits of tea and ginger at the bottom of your cup. It is flavorful and delicious. Otherwise, the turkey, jam, and cheese crepe is my favorite (#9?), but I also order the veggie omelet and the sweet crepes from time to time.

I haven't been in for brunch in a while, but when I lived downtown, I remember them having delicious specials that are not on the regular menu on the weekends."}
{"text":"An interesting little surprise on a First Friday--the electric blue neon letters spelled out my beacon when searching for something to drink.  

Small businesses don't get much smaller.  Inside is about as unassuming as you can get.  The bar splits the old duplex's front room in a strictly utilitarian fashion.  Bottles of Monin flavor syrup crowd one side, a vintage ice machine near a single cash register and a small hand-drawn menu on the wall round the place out.   

The raw entrepreneurial spirit that adds to the late night fare downtown can be pretty inspiring sometimes, and I'm kicking myself for not doing it first.  I reasoned downtown didn't need another coffee shop, and I was proven wrong with a place that fills a void I didn't know existed.

What I like about this place is what's not here.  There are no knick-knacks to up-sell, nothing that beckons the over-done scenes found at coffeehouses elsewhere.  There's nothing to take away from a kickass cup of coffee when you want it except what appeared to be a delightful-looking waffle-cone carried out of the back.  

The place was *swamped* on First Friday, but despite the rush it never once felt claustrophobic.  The line shuffled quickly, and my drink was made lickety split, faster than other coffee shops that have a fraction of the crowd.  It arrived so fast, I actually didn't believe it was mine, especially when it seemed the barista was new.  A good sign for his future there.  

The cashier was friendly and we welcomed each other to the neighborhood.  She made sure I got my 10th JoBot Free card.  

But you know what the best part was?   I casually noted the price of the large $4 latte.  I can't drink cow's milk, so I get soy.  And coffee is just boring without a flavor shot.  

Anywhere else I go, that \"$4\" drink is at least $6.  At JoBot, it was still $4.  

When she told me that, I had been repeatedly counting my dollar bills, pondering the final damage of my add-ons.  Needless to say, I didn't believe her.  

Practically everything has its catch, its obnoxious little down-side.  

Except JoBot.  Thank you Mr. Sagasta.

10/10."}
{"text":"I love trying out local eateries, and am always hopeful that I can give a local place rave reviews. Unfortunately, I can't really rave about Jobot. 

The first time I went I had a crepe with ricotta cheese, homemade jam, and powdered sugar. The crepe was fantastic! If this review was based solely on that, I'd give it 5 stars. It was perfectly balanced, not too sweet, the crepe itself was neither too thick nor too thin, and the portion was perfect. To drink, I ordered a raspberry Italian creme soda. I've had better. The balance of syrup to soda water was off, and all the syrup managed to do was make it slightly pink. Generally, I expect my Italian sodas to be a little sweet. Not sticky sweet, but sweet enough. This really wasn't sweet at all. So that kind of sucked.

The second time I was there, I brought a friend. Instead of going for a crepe, I decided to try a sandwich. I got the Jo-Banh Mi, and my friend got the Torta. Both the pork on my sandwich and on hers was good. The sauces were flavourful, and both had a little bit of a kick. I wish my banh-mi had come on a crustier bread, since it got a wee bit soggy pretty quick. I ended up ditching the bread and just eating the pork with a fork. I ordered another raspberry creme soda, and asked them to make it extra sweet. Yeah, it wasn't. Still just pink soda water. Kind of disappointing. 

So basically, the food was good. Based on my experiences, I'd recommend the crepes over anything else. However, I knocked off a couple stars for the service and the atmosphere. The gentleman who took my order the first time, was helpful for disinterested. Was more interested in chatting up the girls at the counter. The woman who took my order the second time was pretty checked out. She mentioned she'd worked there for two years, and just seemed bored. There was no communication from the people who brought the food out. But after watching for a little bit, I'm thinking it was just me. Anyone who came in that appeared to be either a) college age, b) a \"hot chick\", or c) a hipster, everyone was super attentive. 

I am none of those things. 

Not only were the employees more attentive to those types of individuals, but I was getting all sorts of side-eyed looks from many of those individuals. Maybe if I had had a beard and a man bun, things would have been different."}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit. I had the crepes and they were pretty awesome. I'm the kind of person that loves personal touch on a place, without getting too carried away. It's a bit small inside but there's plenty of seating outside. The special last Sunday was a some kind of mexican dish that he probably won't make again but is was really freaking good and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Pretty cool coffee shop downtown. Open late and serves food late. Great Service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Well done! My girl and I were out taking a walk this morning...when she said \"lets get breakfast here\"...a place that she visits when she is up late studying. Admittedly I am about the furthest thing from what I'd picture the average guest here looks like...and from what I viewed walking in this morning...I would be fairly accurate. I was highly overdressed with my collared golf shirt and Old Navy jeans....but thankfully no one held that against me :p
My love had scrambled eggs with jalapenos/ cheese/chorizo and loved it. I had pecan apple bacon crepes...which were also excellent. We both liked the coffee...not to strong or SBucks bitter Most of these \"artsy\" places charge you mega money for tiny portions, essentially having you pay for the \"experience\" of being there...in which case I end up hitting up Mickey D's for a egg mcmuffin or two after I dine at such places just to fill me up, this was not the case here...fair price as well as portion size.....I am impressed....wow...whats happening to me..my GF made me drive her Prius, and now I have been seen on Roosevelt Row eating at a hippie joint...Glenn Beck....save my soul! :) Cant wait to go back and try something different!"}
{"text":"Had coffee here was a nice place  Parking can be a bit of a pain but it's downtown .People that  work there are very friendly . Nice feel to the place ."}
{"text":"Place is great. Always open food is delicious and coffee is fresh. The jo bot breakfast sandwich is the biz"}
{"text":"I miss their old location. I like how they added a bar which adds \"cool\" points. I like how it is open late. The ambiance is nice and relaxing but if you want to study, go to the library because it can get loud. I just come here for their crepes and maybe their coffee."}
{"text":"The most AWESOMEST thing is it's open 24 hours during the weekends. This was quite handy since I had to find something not fast food nearby at 6am on a Saturday.

#9 SAVORY ($8)
- applewood smoked bacon & garlic herb turkey breast, jobot mixed berry compote topped with an over easy egg and powdered sugar
- PERFECT blend of savory and sweet!
- the turkey wasn't dry and quite flavorful
- enjoyed every single bit of it.
- wish I could find something like this in Los Angeles.

CAPPUCCINO ($3)
- solid with good coffee flavor
- compliments the crepe very well

SERVICE: staff was very friendly even if it was 6am in the morning. They steered me in the right direction as to what to order since the menu is so extensive! Food was made to order and served at just the right temperature.

ENVIRONMENT: very quaint setting on the corner of Roosevelt and 5th St. It actually looks like a house from the outside. There is a large outdoor seating area which is awesome for when the weather doesn't get too hot. The inside seating is more like a homey coffee shop feel. There are actually seats at the coffee bar. Some may even say it has a hipster vibe.

Overall, great place to check out in the Arts District of Phoenix. May not have the same vibe as Lux and definitely not as expensive. Parking may be difficult as it's a residential area. I would definitely recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee. Very rich, deep flavor. I dig the atmosphere of this place. Ya know, the whole 'house turned coffee shop' vibe. There are tables outside on the front lawn and patio, tables scattered throughout the house and a bar in the front room. It gives the place a very comforting mood. Like going over a kooky Aunt's house.

The only thing I was sketched out by was, if you look into the back room next to the bar there's a shelf covered with electrical chords plugged in and going every which way. It looks absolutely crazy, like an electrical fire waiting to happen. Makes me wonder what other crazy shit is going on back there. 

Other than the imminent death, the coffee was great and the scone I had was tasty. I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Everyone had been recommending Jobot to me since I came to downtown Phoenix for school, but it's been three years, and only now have I tried it out. Needless to say, my friends were all correct: Jobot is one of the best coffee shops. The space is pretty industrial but still welcoming, and the menu has variety but also plenty of staples. I tried out a chorizo crepe and was pretty happy with it, although the chorizo was spicer than I expected. I also like the option of having patio seating because sometimes they music is a little too loud indoors, making it difficult to have conversations, though I wouldn't mind it for studying. Overall, I'd say its pretty ideal for doing work or hanging out, and I'll have to come back before I leave downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I love this place for food, coffee, or studying. While it has gotten less quaint and much busier over the years I still love to cuddle up with a book or my laptop for a Sunday morning study session. Their staff is, well, not unfriendly but they are a little more on the serious side, I suppose. But hey, if I wanted to be verbally molested and OVERLY engaged by my barista, I would go to Dutch Bros. Amirite? 

Overall, great food, great atmosphere, and leave the baristas alone, they are busy!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place, especially their weekend hours! We came right before midnight after some bar hopping and needing a late night snack. This place seems like it is in a residential neighborhood but was very welcoming with a cool vibe. 

There was a great selection of sweet and savory crepes - we went with one stuffed with ricotta and topped with chocolate and almonds, as well as one stuffed with peanut butter and chocolate. They were both so soft, delicious and satisfying! We took them down with some fresh coffee to cap off a great evening!"}
{"text":"I am so sad to have to give this place two stars, because it is really only because of one person. I live very close by and frequent the shops around this place a lot. I came here one morning with my boyfriend and he got the hungry man and I had a yogurt. The food was wonderful; we sat outside and had a really nice breakfast together. Needless to say if this was my only experience with them they would have 5 stars, but unfortunately it was not. 

I ordered food TOGO on a Sunday morning, which I am not naive to the fact that places are busy on Sunday morning especially around the time that I ordered. I spoke to a gentleman on the phone who took my order and confirmed my wait time to be between 15 to 20 minutes. I arrived around 20 minutes later to pay for my food. While in line I could not notice the way the barista was speaking to some of the customers. I get that this is a new day and people are allowed to have opinions and market themselves however these seem fit, however I would hope this coffee shop doesn't not want to be represented they way this woman carried herself. I paid for my TOGO and she did not say one word to me, like \"let me check on that\" or \"let me see how much longer.\" But hey, it was a Sunday morning like I said before so maybe she was so busy she did not have the time to give a thought to my order. Fine. I'll let that slide. I stood in that coffee shop for another 30 minutes before I finally said something to her, and asked her about my food. She responded that they had a lot of TO GO orders and my was being boxed up next. Fine, again I just wanted my food. Another 15 minutes goes by and more food comes out of that window, none of which are mine. So again I asked her, \"so, clearly mine was not the next to get boxed, could you check to see how much longer? I just don't want to be lied to about my food order.\" She gave me the worst attitude ever because I must have inconvenienced her that my food was not out yet after I have waited by this time an hour for my breakfast. The real person that should be upset was me. Although her nasty attitude and belittling comments really took a turn when she felt the need to bring me my food and as I walked up to her she walked right past me as if that food wasn't mine, went to the little bar they have in there to get me a spoon turned around to then give me my food. An immature game played by a women that needed to make herself feel better on what must have been a tough day for her. I hope that your future is filled with better days so she can have a better attitude towards life."}
{"text":"Had to update as the experience of stopping in can change when you have a toddler along. My daughter LOVED her food, danced to the music, had a great time. Our food and drinks were wonderful, JoBot is totally child friendly, and too me that makes a huge difference! Can't love a place anymore than that! I really love this place!"}
{"text":"Really not impressed, went in and tried a dirty chai latte and got what tasted like dirty coffee water. The aesthetic was appealing, but staff didn't seem attentive and a bit ditzy. This is right across the street from where I live so I really hoped for better."}
{"text":"Enter this place for a telecommute to some hip european city. Everything is great about this place, you'll always find a surprise. Try everything there."}
{"text":"My pal Dayvid recommended I check this place. DANG IT.

That weird crepe with turkey breast, bacon, swiss cheese, fruit compote, powdered sugar AND a egg on top is haunting me.

Nowhere in Los Angeles has something similar. Now I have to figure out how to make this.

Good coffee, good vibes, keep on :)"}
{"text":"Came here about an hour and a half before closing with a couple of friends after work. I expected it to be warmer inside since it had recently rained and was freezing outside but no it was still chilly. I ordered my favorite, a jelly turkey melt while my friends took my suggestions on dishes I've had before and ordered some chile fries and a chicken quesodilla. we all ordered iced chai's which tasted okay (we agreed that  we've had better elsewhere) Food was good and we all shared a strawberry Nutella crepe which we thought was delicious. Only.thing that bugged me was the cold and the fact that it was alot quieter than usual (music wise). We still enjoyed ourselves and will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Since my very first journey into the bosom of JoBot over a decade ago, much has changed.

They added more delicious food options, traded their cash register for an iPad and opened up the indoor dining space. I must say that I do miss the cozy, homey vibe that came with nestling into the labyrinth-like wooden dining space but I'm happy to see them growing

These crepes are the best! My favorite has fresh spinach, basil, black bean, sun dried tomatoes and the PESTO! I could write an ode to their pesto. It has me dreaming about it, salivating and fantasizing about it...really.

Good coffee, amazing food, cool chill space indoors and out. I also hear they are getting their liquor license - can't wait!"}
{"text":"The cold brew iced coffee was amazing, I would definately get it again. The food/sandwich I had here was well worth the money, $14 for everything. I was actually skeptical at first because of the questionable ingredients together in the turkey-jelly something sandwich I got but it was recommended by the barista and turned out surprisingly good & my friend loves the crepes. The music was chill (weezer & brand new). My only thing was the neighborhood was kinda shabby (the businesses here are run out of houses in a residential neighborhood) but I guess thats the scene in this general vicinity! Also very interesting art on the walls..."}
{"text":"Delish!!! Offers something for everyone. Friendly, hip and unique! Everything I expected from a downtown Phoenix eatery. Chorizo crepe is outstanding!!!!"}
{"text":"JoBot is a hipster coffee joint in the Roosevelt Row. It's hard to distinguish whether these historical house-like buildings are actual residences or business establishments... but I guess that ambiguity adds to the character of this place. 

Friend and I went to eat a light breakfast before our flight. I ordered a house coffee (bottomless) and the JoMama's Breakfast sandwich (good, but the mustard was a bit sweet). Definitely has a homemade feel to its food. Time of prep was close to 10-15 minutes, so not quite a \"grab and go\" kind of spot. Seems to be a nice study cafe for hispters and college students alike."}
{"text":"I thought you couldn't get better than these crepes, but Jobot's potatoes topped with cream and Pico may be the best thing in the wintery valley of the sun!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Latte from here and it was the worse tasting coffee I've EVER had. The service was atrocious and would NOT recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"So freaking good. The vibe here is really chill. The food is crazy good. I love the breakfast burrito with black beans instead of chorizo (simply because I don't eat meat) but I've heard that people love the chorizo. The coffee is on point here as well!"}
{"text":"Went to grab a late night cup of coffee at this 24-7 spot.  The coffee is great but the service was bitchy. She really thought her coffee grounds didn't stink and seemed annoyed at our arrival. The place was thrown together in a quant old bungalow style home which has character,  but ultimately lacked class in the staff,  which is what would make a difference.  Next time I'll go somewhere else because service is half of it!"}
{"text":"My opinion has definitely shifted since they relocated. I was a regular at the 5th St. location, and I ended up there on most days after school when I was in high school. Although the relocation and all the other changes may be sad, JoBot seems to be thriving in a much more positive way than they were before. The coffee is always good, the food is a bit more expensive for my taste, but still really good always. :)"}
{"text":"My wife really wanted to try this place out, and I love crepes, so why not.
Got iced chai, it had a really weird taste, like too much luke warm milk and the spices didn't mix well and just sat at the bottom, I took it back and just got a water, which was pretty warm actually, then I had the banana, nutella crepe, this was close to being nasty, it had the black bean flavor in it from my wifes crepe, that they cooked first and served 5 minutes before I got mine, and I'm still not sure what they used for it, I think it was flour tortilla my wife didn't think so.
I give it 2 stars because my wife liked her bean crepe and ice coffee.

They couldn't even serve me cold water, their not getting my business again."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of folks for brunch.  We took advantage of spring in February and took over a couple of picnic tables in the front yard. Really nice relaxing atmosphere. Service was friendly, even after I spilled some of my coffee on myself and the floor. :)  I had a jelly turkey melt that had Jalapeno bacon jam in it. It was great. I did not hear a single complaint about anything that anybody else had either. I know modern day coffee shops are all about the different coffee based drinks but their base drip coffee is pretty good black."}
{"text":"I really like the banana Nutella crepes, and coffee. My husband wasn't impressed at all, by the food or the service. I sat inside but they have a decent patio with a Phoenix gentrification-in-progress ambience. 
I've been three times now and the service has been consistently poor. Even as the first customer of the day with no one else in the place we couldn't get a coffee refill. 
You can bring your dog, sit on the patio, and have a nice breakfast, but probably only one cup of coffee. 
I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. Just not quite 4."}
{"text":"Holy Crepes! 
Iced Mocha - More like iced \"crack\" mocha...I'm bouncing off the walls. Si Si me gusta~
Banana-Nutella Crepe - Sweet Virgin Mary silhouette on my morning toast, It was heavenly!
...AND a punch card?! I'll be a doughy mess in no time. Thanks yo!"}
{"text":"Open 24 hours through the weekend, until midnight otherwise. Downtown is starting to have a life.

Early 20th Century bungalow, as all these funky businesses on this block. Across the street tonight was an excellent jazz guitarist plucking away, alone, lost in his music, in a front yard ...

The savory and sweet crepes just keep getting better, and I finally made it last Sunday to the brunch - the best light pancakes I've tasted in years served with real maple syrup and exquisite Schreiner's sausage. Nibbled over two hours of unending visits and great  Beirut-style cafe banter from downtown's notables.

Life is good."}
{"text":"Very hipsterish! Don't you dare ask for decaf or an artificial sweetner!"}
{"text":"I really want to write a 5 star review for this cool, funky, full of \"love\" downtown establishment but being the Yelper that I am, several factors prevent me from doing so. 
The first & foremost is the choice of music that the DJ played on the chosen Sunday afternoon when my son & I were there. 
It was a beautiful afternoon, perfect weather as Phoenix can be in January. Glorious, in fact.  My son (who is 8) and I had just finished volunteering at a nearby community garden, was starving and walked over here around 1pm to have lunch. 
There was loud music playing, the patio was filled with diners, everything was picture perfect. 
Then I asked my son if he wanted to sit outside or inside. He chose inside which was odd since the weather was so nice out. So we sat inside for a bit then I convinced him to go outside which he begrudgingly did. He kept fidgeting on the bench- finally I asked him what was wrong and he blurts out- \"Mom, are you listening to the words to the music???  It's sh*t this, *uck that and I'm going to kill this person or that person.\" 
My mouth immediately formed an \"o\" because I had not been listening to the words as I had processed the music into background noise. 
Of course we moved back inside right away where the choice of music was much more suitable for all ages & genders. 
Pretty poor choice by the DJ I would say and pretty poor selection by the management for picking aforementioned DJ!
The other issue I had was I had ordered the crepe w pulled pork shoulders. When the dish came, the pork was not pulled but sliced. It was also very dry- served without any sort of sauce. And the red cabbage/ cilantro salad so beautifully described on the menu was just some chopped up red cabbage. 
The server was very nice and brought me extra salsa & extra lime/cilantro dressing to make the dish taste less dry. It was still a disappointment. 
My son was also disappointed with his cheese/chicken quesadilla saying there was not enough cheese (truth- it was very skimpy) and some slices had cheese and chicken while others barely had any fillings. It was uneven. 
I would come back here again. I do love the vibe and would give this place another chance!"}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, and atmosphere. The staff is always friendly. I usually use it to study late into the night. Super bummed that they'll be closing this location  Hopefully they're able to find a new space that's just as good, if not better."}
{"text":"I appreciate that the chai is real tea and not made from some syrup or concentrate, but the couple times I've gotten it, it hasn't been mixed to my liking. With JoBot the honey and spices seem to to always just sit sadly at the bottom of my cup."}
{"text":"My friend and I have recently made a point to try out a new coffee shop once a week in the Phoenix area. We came here on a recommendation of a friend who said the food was delicious. We had no problem getting parking right out front around 10:30 on a Friday. There was no wait at the counter and I ordered a medium latte (4$), a side of eggs ($2), and a chive bacon cheddar cheese biscuit ($3). I was going to order a small but the barista pointed out that their small was particularly small and I chose to size up (thank you!). 

My friend and I sat out on the patio and eyed the crepe the people next to us ordered. I will be sure to order one next time I'm here. The eggs came out quickly and were well seasoned and fluffy. The latte was equally fantastic! We enjoyed taking in the neighborhood scenery and over all it was a very relaxed and calm atmosphere. 

Overall it was a great spot to hang out and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Nothing I would change."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great food and great drinks. Honestly sometimes the service can suck but for the most part they provide good service and food.  Get the jorito. The salsa is the fucking best. Also love the pancakes."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this hippie coffee house .... The food and coffee is amazing ... Started off with a homemade donut filled with Nutella .... A M A Z I N G!!
Then had a grilled cheese sandwich with chicken flavored with chorizo .... With roasted potatoes .... Grilled and seasoned perfectly ..... If you are a red state voter you may not care for the clientele and stickers ..."}
{"text":"Don't believe the menu on their website; their actual, in store menu is completely different & does not contain any Vegan options.  I don't recommend this place and cannot condone their bait & switch tactics."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch one beautiful Sunday around 1030am. Jobot is easy to find, next to our favorite gem of a bar, Lost Leaf.  The restaurant is quite small as it is a converted bungalow, which in my opinion adds to the charm of the place.  We were greeted and welcomed in immediately.  There was probably room for about 25 or so people seated inside and at the bar, and then another 30 outside on their patio which was already filled with people.  

I ordered the jo-rrito & a chai and my husband ordered the country breakfast and a coffee.  The woman told us to expect a little wait because they were just starting to get busy, which we totally understand and have no issue waiting. We took our seat with our drinks and I'm glad we got there when we did, because there was a sudden line out the door!  You wouldn't be able to sit at the bar during this time as the line stretches past the seats, hugging them, so there would be no room at all to get in and sit at the bar comfortably.

We probably waited about 20 minutes for our food which was brought out to use. I was pleased that the jo-rrito was not the size of a football like most breakfast burritos are. It was normal sized! yay! I might be able to finish this... and I did.  Husband loved his country breakfast which was layered with a bean paste that was quite tasty.  Everything was delicious and hit the right spot. All in all, we enjoyed this place and give it a healthy 4 stars."}
{"text":"The coffee and food are amazing. Seriously, I've worked throughout Latin America and I've been to so many coffee shops. This is the best coffee and even better cold brew in the world. 

Why don't you rate it 5 Stars? It's with a heavy heart that I can't go to Jobot anymore. I used to go to work on homework and it was an amazing place. BUT the internet is unreliable. I can't figure out how to \"trigger\" the prompt to enter the password. Probably because I've been there so much and my computer knows the password. I don't know what the issue is and whenever I ask for help from the workers, they can't help me either. I'm in law school and I need access to the internet to get my work done. There were too many incidents when I ordered a meal and coffee only to realize that I couldn't connect to the internet when I sat down. This is an amazing environment for me to do my homework and I really wish I could make it work. 

This place is amazing. Whenever I don't need the internet, I'll come back. But unfortunately, that won't be often."}
{"text":"Great coffee and food.

A very lay back environment, I wasn't to fond of the customer service aspect, that is the only reason I didn't give JoBot five stars."}
{"text":"I love heading downtown - we stopped on a Sunday morning and it wasn't packed like other breakfast joints. You walk up to the counter and order - at first I was a little confused because the setup seemed a little off. You wait in line right next to the counter with seats. So I guess you can order at the bar?  No, the register? Yes, the register!

We ordered the chorizo, mozzarella, cheese and spinach scramble and the warm peanut butter crepes. Both were delicious!! There weren't very many tables so we opted for a two person table right next to the bathroom. Just the way the seats are set up and how you can see the bathroom every time someone walks in and out of it while I eat is a little disturbing. Now I know why some restaurants have a wall between the bathroom and your dining area. 

I could have seated outside but it was a tad bit hot. There was a dj and I was totally getting into the music. I ordered an iced vanilla latte with almond milk and it was ok. I wouldn't come back for the coffee, but I would come back for the food."}
{"text":"I have been to JoBot a few times and have always just gotten coffee, which has been good (not mind-blowing, just average). Today I was with a friend and we were in the area, so we stopped by JoBot for lunch. We both got the Jo-Banh Mi and...it was absolutely disgusting! Plus, it was not a Banh Mi. It was spicy, pulled pork with shredded carrots on a french roll. No pickled vegetables, no cilantro, no baguette, and smothered in sauce! 

If you have never had a real Banh Mi, then you may think that this is the real thing, but it's not. I really hope the owners of JoBot read this review and either change how they make their Bahn Mi or change the name of the sandwich because, what they served me, was a misleading, disgusting slop of Americanized garbage!"}
{"text":"I swung by this joint during the summer, and I will forewarn everybody that they only have an evaporative cooler and some fans, which I don't mind, however when I'm trying to study or do some work in my computer, haha. My husband had to do some hw and all of the outlets were taken. It's pretty hipster, rustic, kind of neat, but too hot for the summer, especially when you're trying to get work done. We pretty much just ordered some regular coffees sat down for a good 30 minutes then left because it was a little too humid and hot for us to do our work. We ended up going next door to melt, which was awesome! (Going to write a review for them). The coffees were good, we would like to visit again and try out the crepes sometime, and stay longer too of course! So I will post an update review in the near future!"}
{"text":"Small but warm and welcoming. You feel welcomed as soon as you walk in. Awesome coffee and great food. Reasonably priced as well. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"The crepes at JoBot are fucking awesome, as is pretty much everything else. This place is where dreams come true."}
{"text":"We only had mochas, but let me tell you, they were the best I've ever had in my life. Excellent place! It has a fun atmosphere and great music too."}
{"text":"I like Kharli. She is my favorite because she is the prettiest person at jobot. Also she makes good drinks."}
{"text":"Ummm, ya, crunchy...groovy? Unexpected, unapologetic; it does what it wants and does it well. A random coffee house that also serves fun crepes. In the mood for something different, but worthy? Set GPS to \"JoBot Coffee\"."}
{"text":"I would love to be writing a review right now of JoBot's delicious coffee and scones... but, alas, I cannot because the snob of a barista refused to even acknowledge our presence let alone actually offer to serve us a coffee.  We stumbled upon JoBot on a random Saturday driving through downtown and thought we would stop in for a drink.  There were four or five other people in the place and we took a seat up at the bar.  The barista was in the process of taking another person's order and everyone else appeared to have been served already.  We had no problems waiting while he wrapped up.  Ten minutes later... and he still hasn't said a peep to us, hasn't even made eye contact actually.  The thrill of supporting a local business waned and we eventually (13 min after arriving) got up and left.  It truly felt as though we didn't fit their desired clientele and therefore they didn't want to be bothered with us polluting their hip aesthetic.  Give me Starbucks' friendly baristas over that crap any day."}
{"text":"This place has great food. I love the environment. It's hip and trendy. I love that it's open 24/7 on the weekends. That means I could get crepes at like 2 in the morning. I ordered the number 9 crepe which has chicken, bacon, and a delicious compote. It's definitely savory and filling. The price is also not too bad. It's great for the food quality you're getting. We ordered 2 drinks, 3 crepes, and a bowl of french fries for about 30 dollars. Not too shabby. Will come again and again when I'm in the area. Too bad there's not one by my house because I would have come every single day!"}
{"text":"Everyone loves jobot! Great community place to go, fun, and delicious food. Love the expansions."}
{"text":"Cool lil spot. Really dope vegan option if you get the lentil sammy on a different bread. Love the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now on the weekend for late night coffee and dessert. They have all the normal coffee drinks, scones, cookies, and lots of crepes( sweet & savory ). 

I have had the cinnamon & sugar crepe and the lemon and powdered sugar one. Both crepes were cooked perfectly, they could have used a little more of the flavoring in the crepes, but overall they were good. My italian creme soda they made me really hit the spot ( i am not a coffee drinker). My husband really enjoyed his iced toddy and their other hot coffees. 

Service was  great and this place is open 24 hours on Friday & Saturday nights...go check them out."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall, good old school music and great value! $6 for sweet crepes and $7 for savory. 

I ordered the rancher and soy iced latte. Loved them both!"}
{"text":"Hip place for coffee and craft beer. Has a nice outdoor patio with electrical outlets and open WiFi."}
{"text":"What an amazing place! From the moment you pull up, the vibe at JoBot is unlike any other coffee shop I've been to in Phoenix (or ever, for that matter!). Located in the heart of Roosevelt Row, this lovely place fits right in to the culture and ambience of its surroundings.

With a huge outdoor front patio, JoBot is a perfect place to hang with friends, get work done, or just enjoy their great coffee on the front porch. Averaged priced, you'll get more value from one cup of coffee here than your Starbucks. Plus, you'll be supporting local businesses!

Get to JoBot at least once while you're in Phoenix."}
{"text":"i'm not sure why i haven't written a review for jobot yet- i'm there at least once a week and it has become my go to coffee shop. their toddy is the best i've had in phoenix- it's well made and a good price. the crepes are good as well- i usually get either a #2 or a #3 with an egg. i've really never had issue with the service- i'm not expecting my barista and i to be bffs. the fact that they are open late sun-thurs and 24 hours on fri and sat is a plus and so is the wifi. it's a cool spot and the crowd is way less pretentious than lux or cartel.  have only one complaint- the piano in the back room has been a source of annoyance for months now. i know it's not always being used but when it is, it makes me question whether to move onto songbird or lola..."}
{"text":"I'll give 4 stars, credit to the great folks and amazing Latte. The food is good too, not special, but worth a praise. I will go back soon."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the hipster vibe and unique crepe based menu. I frequent this spot for study/blogging sessions. I do think they need to give this place a little more TLC though and work on establishing better Wifi connection. I had to leave last time because both my boyfriend and I couldn't get internet connection. 

Still a great local spot!"}
{"text":"Terrible service at the bar. Sat down at the bar and no one even looked in my direction. I had to get up and order my beer from a pretty boring selection. The whole time I drank my beer no one came over to see how I was doing or ask if I wanted another drink. I'm here on a work trip. Usually you can sit at a bar when its not crowded and ask the bartender suggestions for places to go. Not here"}
{"text":"I ordered a cappuccino here.  It was fine, flavorful, with a creamy crema; quite soft, and smooth but with a nice weight to it, like a curvy girl.  The cappuccino was sized nicely right.  Open atmosphere inside and out, people hanging about doing whatnots."}
{"text":"This isn't solely a coffee shop. If you're looking for high quality coffee and service I recommend going elsewhere. This is half restaurant/diner with one corner dedicated to coffee. The vibe isn't exactly welcoming and the coffee shop line forms right in the middle of their walk way inside. You stand right next to their kitchen where orders come out. It's loud in here, very crowded and like I said before, NOT A COFFEE SHOP. Looked like a cool spot to grab drinks! It is in downtown Phoenix though so be prepared for downtown Phoenix. My drink was OK but I would not go back. I didn't finish even half of it."}
{"text":"Jobot is a lovely establishment, I highly recommend it. Everyone that I have brought here has really loved it, and I think liked me more because of my good taste :) 

Food/Drink: One gripe I have with a lot of coffee shops is how pretentious they are. The overwhelming variety of options makes me feel like a chump and not worthy. Jobot, on the other hand, has enough variety and sufficient quality to appease my friends with more distinguished palates, but makes me feel comfortable (this could also be due to their service which I will expound on more below). I always get the cold brew, and I personally find it delicious. Plus, the coffee is locally sourced, which always makes me feel better. As far as the noms go, I've only tried a pastry. I remember thinking it was good, but also can't remember what it was, so it clearly wasn't that memorable. 

Atmosphere: Jobot's atmosphere is what sets it apart. It's quiet, but not oppressively so. I've done work on my laptop in a corner before, and have also brought friends and family here to chat and play board games. Both times, I felt at ease. There is also an outdoor patio which is nice when it's cooler out, and is also dog-friendly. I've brought my own board games to play, but have also played using their small arsenal-- I think all they have is Scrabble, chess, and dominoes, but I could be wrong.

Service: The people who work at Jobot are super nice, and that may also be what contributes to my good impression of the atmosphere. They are patient and helpful. I came once with a friend who can be demanding and rude at times, and the staff dealt with the situation very calmly and professionally. They also keep the place spick and span.

Parking: Even though it's downtown, there's a covered parking lot right next to it that usually has one or two spaces for non-residents. There's a two-hour max for parking, which is not ideal, but they don't enforce this too strictly in my experience. Plus, the area around is nice enough to walk around a bit from wherever you parked."}
{"text":"Good things: soy chai latte (honestly the best I've ever had, anywhere), artsy environment, outdoor seating is plentiful.

Bad things: limited parking, and the crepes aren't very crepe-y. They're more like tortillas trying really really hard to be French."}
{"text":"Overrated and overpriced - we tried to go last week and it was jam-packed. Not sure why. The toddy was good but we had to wait to get the attention of the \"barista\" to get some cream and my friend had to wait after others behind us had been served to get her coffee. The half a breakfast sandwich at $5 was not worth that much but the $3.50 lemon crepe was good. It was ok but not somewhere I'd go out of my way for again."}
{"text":"I do love this place. The food and the ambiance is eclectic, unique, and fun. I love the live music and choice of drinks and food. I got the chilaquiles and classic crepe. My boyfriend got the sweet potato biscuit and gravy dish. Our food was SO good. I couldn't give the place 5 stars because there wasn't enough seating for the volume they did, we were cramped on the side of some people by the window. Also our food took about 30 minutes, probably a little more. Not terrible but it was long enough for us to notice, and we're definitely not impatient people. I still would've gave the place 4 stars, but our food was kind of cold, I ordered an egg for my chilaquiles, it never came out. So I politely asked the cashier who rang us up if I could get it, still never came out. Usually I wouldn't care so much about it, but I had already paid extra for the egg that I never got. 

I still recommend this place. Our experience was probably not the best due to it being a very busy Sunday afternoon, but not being able to find a seat, food taking very long, and never receiving something I paid for made me bring it down 2 stars. But the coffee is outstanding, food is great, and energy is also great. I hate giving bad reviews but I really do like this place and hope someone sees it and maybe want to make a little improvement."}
{"text":"Positives: open late, free wi-fi, free entomology lessons (if that's your thing...read on)

Negatives: everything else

OK WOW!  I have been meaning to write my first review for a while now, but I was basically forced to do it right now by my experience at Jobot.  Too bad my first review has to be a negative one, but I feel I owe it to all of you who so faithfully warn me to stay away from places like this, although you may have let me down on this one!

So I read through most of the reviews and felt that I had a fairy good idea of what to expect.  Since many reviews seemed positive enough, I thought I'd give it a try since I am getting bored with the same old coffee joint.  So I found my way from the dark street in front of Jobot, through the dimly lit patio area, up onto the old wooden porch, to the front door, and into Jobot ready to fall in love with the place.  

As I entered I was initially overwhelmed by three things.  One: the blaring punk music, two: the swamp cooler blasting air and noise directly at my head, and three: the total apathy of the staff who were conversing among themselves (ironically, about how \"dead\" it's been) while ignoring me.  I was eventually approached by a worker and I placed my order ($2.75 for an 8oz skim latte...more about the latte later).  

While waiting for my latte, I decided to have a look at the pastry selection at the end of the coffee bar; only problem was, there were 3 employees standing there talking and blocking access to the pastry case.  I politely said \"excuse me\" as I tried to squeeze by them.  I kid you not...they glanced at me and then continued talking.  I squeezed thru the gaggle of employees determined to get a look at the pastries.  Once through the gauntlet of employees, I had a look at the pastries, which looked a little \"run thru the mill\" if you know what I mean.

OK so determined to make the best of this experience, I pressed on.  While continuing to wait for my latte I poked my head into the two adjacent rooms.  The rooms are dingy and uninviting with hard, uncomfortable wooden benches and cheap metal frame stacking style chairs scattered about.  The crowd inside (two customers) was interesting.  One guy covered head to toe in tattoos hunched over an old laptop, and an older man snoozing in the corner near his empty coffee cup and book.  

...so back to waiting for my latte.  I intended to pay for it when I was intercepted by a 2 inch long cockroach crossing the floor between me and my latte.  I politely waited for it to pass.  While waiting for the roach to pass, I glanced at the guy who seemed to be in charge of the place to see how he would handle this most interesting situation.  He looked at me, shrugged his shoulders as if to say \"whatcha gonna do\"?  I almost laughed at the absurdity of it all, but quickly remembered I was on the hook to pony up the currency for my latte, which I did, albeit reluctantly at this point. 

I have taken my seat, opened my laptop, and am writing this review as we speak.  A few more shady characters have popped in and out, although they don't seem to be customers since they didn't buy any food or drink.  I assume they are friends with the owner(s).  

My stomach has turned sour from the experience with the roach and having to recount the ordeal in detail as I write this review... so my latte will sit untouched as I leave in about 1 minute from now.  

I hope you have enjoyed my contribution.  Thanks for sharing all of yours!"}
{"text":"Jobot is amazing. I got an iced vanilla latte and the Nutella & banana crepe this morning. Both the coffee and the crepe were fantastic. I liked the big outdoor front patio. The interior of the shop isn't huge so that added the additional seating that was needed. I plan on going out of my way to go to Jobot for coffee before work this week because it was so good. I 100% recommend it."}
{"text":"Cute little place.  I always get the chai tea latte and it never disappoints.  Refreshing alternative to the coffee chains. Place is pretty small so it can be at times hard to find a place to sit."}
{"text":"Can't speak to the food, but the coffees here are splendid. I always order Americanos or cold brew when I go to coffee shops to see how good their coffee REALLY is, and Jobot has some killer beans. Worth a stop if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The chopped salad is delicious,  and the crepes....oooh the crepes,  yum! Great vibe,  with a nice outdoor seating area as well as window counter."}
{"text":"Yum yum, I love me some rootbeer pork crepe with my mocha latte late night. This place is cool! Old house into hip coffee shop."}
{"text":"Love love love! Best iced tea selection ever!  I tried the peanut butter and jelly donut and it was fluffy and delightful. Staff is always quick and friendly. Def a great place to take a stroll to."}
{"text":"24 HOUR CREPES ON THE WEEKENDS! The lemon! The powdered sugar! The hipster organic coffee and toddys!!

This is everything I want out of a coffee shop. Love you guys. A little condescending at times, and the female baristas don't seem to care much about anything, but to all the dudes working here, keep it up!"}
{"text":"I love crepe and tea. Next time I will try donut. The outdoor table is nice to be there and absorbing Roosevelt row neighborhood."}
{"text":"Amazing food. We landed in Phoenix and the first thing we found was JoBot Coffee and did we really find a gem. My sandwich was great while the other crepes we ordered were great too."}
{"text":"Loved the music here -- they were playing an Odesza playlist when I was here. What a lovely place to hang out and sip coffee. I sat inside because it was hot out, but there's a nice patio with tables and chairs outdoors too."}
{"text":"Coffee is still good, but their menu isn't good anymore :(. No more of their fried potatoes and very limited in the crepe options; the environment isn't the same either.  Wish is felt more welcoming- music is too loud and it's hard to have a conversation."}
{"text":"JoBot used to be my friends and I's \"spot\" 3 almost 4 years ago. We went here to get coffee, grab savory or dessert crepes and just hangout. Sadly, this place started going downhill beginning of this year. The server wasn't as entertaining or nice as the previous ladies who worked here before, their menu changed completely, and the food as unfortunately in my opinion, overpriced for its quality. 

I am very disappointed and I hope this place recovers!"}
{"text":"This place has some top notch food, no doubt about it! A friend and I went there for the first time and we loved it, I hope that I will be able to get there at least once the next time I'm in Phoenix. And, if I hear that any of my friends will be going to Phoenix, I'll be sure to recommend them to go to Jobot's! :)"}
{"text":"Oh my word!!! Amazing food!! I recommend any crepe on the menu!! Friendly service but the bathroom is a little scary."}
{"text":"JoBot is the culture center of the Arts District. It just is. 

Layal said it best, It's where the artists and makers and movers and shakers and rebels and crazies and dreamers hang out. It's home.

The new JoBot site is being converted to a cool, gone are the bright white lights and in come the soft warm lights, local art and funkyness. Long live JoBot."}
{"text":"I had previously edited this review due to the building owner (not the business owner mind you) being very pet UNfriendly and not allowing dog on the property/patio. I guess the business owner has come to an agreement with the building owner ... not sure what that is but, the place does deserve a 5 star not withstanding."}
{"text":"The turkey pesto crepe was delicious, food was delivered quickly and the guy helping us was really friendly and made our experience there great! Thanks again Jobot for the yummy food& excellent iced coffee. definitely fulfilling"}
{"text":"JoBot is in a very cool, laid back area of Phoenix.  Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.  Cartel coffee is what brings this spot to four stars for me. I'd defintly go back."}
{"text":"Wish I could write a better review about this place but unfortunately there's such little customer service I didn't even get to experience it. I walked in and sat down, had every employee look at me, one even came by straightening the chairs. After sitting there for 10 minutes without any greeting or hello I observed another person walk in and up to the counter to order a coffee. So perhaps you order at the counter then sit and eat but I wouldn't know because everyone working there could have cared less I was there let alone care that I know how to order or what to suggest to order. Sadly I was looking forward to a crepe like in the Yelp pictures. No reason to return, no service to be found here."}
{"text":"Jobot is open 24hrs on Friday & Saturday with good coffee, good food, and relaxed chill atmosphere where even thou there is music playing a conversation can still be had."}
{"text":"Well, I've only been here about 10 times or so and I'm not in the habit of making reviews on Yelp simply bc I'm lazy.

The fact that they have an awesome version of lentil sammich is enough for me to give 5 stars. But I'm pretty easy going and the people there are rather friendly, or at least, easy going and not uptight. Ambiance is cozy and pretty relaxed. I met a lot of randos there, which is nice, cuz I generally like talking to strangers. I like the wooden floors and tables...except for the Ikea coffee table that's near the couch. Industrial fan blowing is quite handy... given the weather tends to be hot and sticky.

I like that it's quiet when they're opened 24 hours. I get a lot of work done."}
{"text":"Another great find, thanks to yelp!   Apple with bacon and strawberry crepe cakes and savory chorizo, spinach, mozzerella crepes! Both were outstanding and the apple with bacon crepes were a surprisingly great combo!  

This place wasn't the easiest to find, for some reason the gps directed us to a place a block away?  It looks like a house.  Cozy and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Oh. Mygod. Ohmygod. 

I thought the first time I came here and only enjoyed coffee that it was spectacular. Then I came back for the crepes. Consider my mind blown.

Not only does the outside have major curb appeal (LOVE the use of color), but you can sit at a coffee bar or outside... or in this whole other room. Come on. With that many seating options, there's something for everyone.

One night I was there, a movie was playing outside. This is the kind of place people can come back to. And the kind of place that Phoenix desperately needs downtown.

The stars reached their highest notch though when I went against my gut instinct and ordered the peanut butter cup crepe. See, I'm a huge fan of the Reese's cup. However, I feel it is nearly impossible to imitate. No one gets that flavor combination right and I end up being sadly disappointed.

If this is your fear too... order the peanut butter cup crepe from Jobot. It was like taking a bunch of Reese's and melting them in a crepe. I will still full from dinner, but I'll be damned if I didn't eat that entire thing.

The staff was super friendly, having conversations with a friend and I as we sat at the counter and indulged our sweet tooth ( is sweet teeth a word). I'll be back.. as often as I can manage :)"}
{"text":"The staff was very helpful and polite. We had the Black Peach and Mint Green Teas (both iced) and they were delicious! I love the vibe of this cute little shop. Creativity oozed from every corner. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Pretty much the best place in Arizona. That gaping hole in the north section of the state runs a close second, but they don't have coffee and comfortable seating up there."}
{"text":"My first time eating at Jobot! The number 4 with corn tortillas rocked my socks, sooo delicious! I felt healthy, light, satisfied and delighted when eating each bite. Just hit the spot! I shared the other two tacos with friends and they adored it just the same! The ingredients and flavor palate was intriguing & melt-worthy.

To drink, I had the African Rose tea which was a refreshing, beautiful field of flowers on my taste buds. I also had a chai after hearing a rave review about it from a local bookstore owner. I am a chai freak and after hearing about how good it was... I just had to try it! It was literally the best chai I've ever had. The perfect blend of spice and sweet. Felt like it was made just for my taste. Chai lattes are often overly sweet or powerfully spicy (the intensity of the spice overpowers the chai), but Jobot's recipe was puuuuuurrrfect. A mouthful of orgasmic bliss at each swallow.

And the environment was very warm and welcoming, friendly faces and great service! Art on the walls of \"local community heroes\" by Aaron was great to see! And extra bonus, Jobot is located right next to Aaron's bookstore, Lawn Gnome Publishing & Bookstore! My first time there as well. It is a breath of positivity, inspiration and creativity! I will be definitely frequenting them both! Visit Jobot & Lawn Gnome now! ;D"}
{"text":"The shops on this small street are examples of repurposed real estate. I've wanted to stop in the coffee shop on the way to work. With time to spare this morning, I dropped by for my morning coffee. The shop had opened at 7 and there was already a lively conversation at the coffee bar. The menu had a good variety of coffee drinks, basic but covered the full spectrum. I decided on a cappuccino. Care was taken to remove bubbles from the steamed milk. The taste was extremely good and the expression made to perfection. By default it was put into a paper to go cup; next time I will ask for a \"for here\" cup. The place is comfortable. Tables inside have a 50's style chrome edge and the chairs remind me of circa 70s school cafeteria. There are plenty of places to sit (open till midnight).  

Great option for those who prefer indie coffee shops."}
{"text":"I have heard great things from a handful of friends, and have lived in the Artisan Village for about a year and a half.  That being said I finally ventured over with my wife and mother in law for some of their crepes.  The owner happened to be there and the one that \"helped\" us.  We were first ignored for a while due to the simple disorganization of the business.  We ordered the root beer pulled pork crepe, the tuna melt, and the chorizo with egg crepe.  The owner wrote down the order but \"forgot\" about the tuna melt that my mother in law ordered, I have held many positions within the food service industry from server to bartender up to general manager so I understand that mistakes get made, no big deal.  He got the remainder of our order out to us and the tuna tasted like tuna right out of the can with nothing else wrapped in a crepe.  The root beer pulled pork which was the most dry pulled pork I have ever had, but the overall flavor was lacking as well.  I let the owner know of my disapointment and his response was simply \"that's too bad\".  I have been in the same situation many times in my experience in restaurants, the difference was the effort put in to keep a patron for repeat business which will not happen.  If you are looking for a good coffee and snack I would recomment looking into either the Tamico/M&J Bread company on Roosevelt in Artisan Village or even Conspire the funky co-op at the end of the street.  I am not one to rant or even complain, but this is not the way to treat any customers especially ones like myself and my wife who would have been frequent patrons of the establishment which is now out of the question.  It certainly is a cozy, laid back, comfortable atmosphere, I would just expect higher quality and a more genuine caring attitude towards local paying customers as a supporter of local businesses.  His complacent attitude left me wondering if we had dressed the part of a certain role we would have been better taken care of."}
{"text":"Summertime wears me out. Their iced mocha hit the spot.

Want to come back to try a toddy, I guess it's iced coffee that is cold brewed, rather than the normal hot brew, so it tastes better. 

Their crepe menu makes me drool too."}
{"text":"There's a special little place in my heart designated specifically for JoBot, so I'm thrilled to be the 100th person to get to sing the praises of this adorable little coffee shop/creperie/hole-in-the-wall bundle of amazing-ness.

I came across JoBot by accident about a year ago while looking for a late night wi-fi spot to do some studying. It fit the bill perfectly, minus the fact that it was extremely difficult to concentrate with the loud music coming from the Lost Leaf, the interesting conversations that I couldn't help from overhearing, and the endless amount of scrumptious plates that kept parading past me. 

That said, I've made several \"study\" trips to JoBot since. While I may not be as productive as I would be at some of those quieter little coffee shops where everyone has their nose in a book or a laptop, I find that I always walk away a very happy camper, every time. 

Their crepes/tacos are delicious. All of them. Sometimes I feel as though the crepes are slightly undercooked, but once I dig inside to discover the tantalizing flavors that lie within, I tend to forget all about that. The root beer pork remains one of my faves followed by a strawberry/banana concoction for dessert. Yum, yum, yum.

Go here if you want good coffee (the bumble bee is tasty), good eats, good conversation, good atmosphere, good prices, good entertainment, and free wi-fi at any and all hours (they don't seem to close on weekends). And if you're really feeling frisky head down a house or two for some NachoBot. Gosh I love this place."}
{"text":"Parking was free and and close to the location...all though they were packed (line out the door) Tabitha was able serve us delicious crepes and coffee in a short amount of time...the best downtown has to offer"}
{"text":"Two words:  SMELLY and DIRTY!  Do not, I repeat, do not go to Jobot if you are hoping for a good environment, clean areas, or a decent crowd.  Is everyone doing these reviews blind??!  I am so disappointed too because I kept hearing about Jobot from multiple people, so I really wanted to check it out and see what it was like.  The cup of iced coffee I had was good, but that is the only positive comment I can make.  The customer service was so-so, the crowd there seemed sketchy and I just generally did not feel welcome or comfortable here.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Jobot is back with an expanded space only a couple blocks away from their original location! Same hours. Same great atmosphere! It's great how they've transformed the space to make it their own. Come check out one of your new favorite hangout spots in DTPHX!"}
{"text":"This is a regular hang-out spot for me and my friends. We come here late at night all the time for coffee and food. It has easily become one of my favorite coffee shops downtown. The coffee and food are awesome! I love that they stay open until midnight every night (and 24 hours on the weekend with a full menu)! It can become really packed inside at night as many people hang out here, but there is plenty of outside seating as well. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I'm usually down at Roosevelt Row at least two to three times a week, and this is the first time I've visited Jobot, and I'm kicking myself. The second I walked in I was greeted by the biggest smile and hello.  I told them I'd never been in before so they gave me a few ideas of a few teas. I chose the Blue Bot Tea and The Jomama breakfast sandwich. The tea was citrusy and so much flavor. It was great even without adding sweetener. The sandwich came out with fresh fruit and the presentation was amazing. I had read another yelp review about how messy it can get, and they weren't joking. One bite and egg yolk was running everywhere. All I have to say about that is get extra napkins because this sandwich was to die for. Literally no joke the best sandwich I've ever had! The wait was less than five minutes from the time I walked in the door to it being brought to me at my table. I chose to sit on the patio because the weather was perfect being so early in the morning. There are quite a few picnic tables with umbrellas. Very clean set up. The inside is very welcoming and you can tell it's a popular place with many regulars. Many high tables tops and a huge bar. Great place, amazing service, and again the BEST breakfast sandwich of my life! Check them out!"}
{"text":"3/31/16

3.25 stars.

Finally made it out here-- I bookmarked this place years ago!

I arrived around a quarter to 11 am, so I'd missed out on a few pastries.  Since it was my first time here, I stood out of line to have a look at the pastry case, as well as check out the menu.  I don't enjoy looking up at wall menus above, so I probably missed out on some cool daily specials...  If you haven't visited Jobot before, you order at the counter and pay, receive an order number to take with you to your table of choice, and then wait for your hot food items to be delivered to you.  (Read between the lines: you MUST retrieve your coffee beverage/s at the counter.  Understandable if ordering drinks to-go, but a little annoying when dining in, but OK.)  The only powdered sugar-free items left, besides savory rolls, were brownies ($2.75?) and brownie cookies ($1.75?), so I bought one of each.  I also ordered a cappuccino ($3.50), a Short Stack of Buttermilk Pancakes with Blueberry-Ginger compote ($8.50), and a side of bacon ($3).  I asked for no powdered sugar on the pancakes, as well as omission of the vanilla maple syrup, since the cashier knew that they'd recently switched from pure maple syrup to one that was a corn syrup blend.  (Kudos to him for knowing that info without having to ask someone in the kitchen!  Love it!)  I also asked if the whipped cream was homemade or from a bottle and was told it was fresh whipped, so I was looking forward to experiencing it.  Paid with a credit card on the iPad, so I didn't get to see my receipt until a few hours later, while I was at the art museum.

Cappuccino was lovely- not so much the coffee art- but the flavors and the mouth-feel. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jobot-coffee-and-diner-phoenix?select=OsmHkS0MntBnn2sUB6z8Zg  I don't add sweeteners to cappuccinos and drip coffees, since I usually pair them with sweet breakfast items.  I could taste the natural sweetness of the milk used- a very nice cup!  The two pastries were delicious: the brownie cookie had great textures and was moderately-sweet. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jobot-coffee-and-diner-phoenix?select=dJy7dqlEc30gefk8AXTdEw  The brownie was very tender and had intense chocolate flavor!  Found it a tad too sweet, though, so I preferred the cookie.  (Strange, as I've always had a fondness for brownies.)  The short stack of pancakes were definitely short! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jobot-coffee-and-diner-phoenix?select=GbBHngF-ROVPxqrm7vca6g  These were flat cakes, so I was glad to see the amount of blueberry compote on top.  I didn't see any ginger in the compote, though, so I was a little worried, and the whipped cream looked and tasted like it came out of a ReadyWhip canister.  Still, I enjoyed a bit of it swirled into the very sweet compote.  I thought the cakes were OK, with the blueberry compote a bit too sweet, until my tongue and teeth discovered chewy bits of spicy ginger here and there, and then I started to enjoy the entree!  And I was worried at the beginning, because the wafts of pork I detected smelt a bit funky.  The bacon looked soggy, too, but I took the plunge and bit into them and found the meat parts crispy enough.  I only eat bacon fat when they're crisped, so I was happy to be able to pick through the inedible fat (to me!) and count my blessings to be able to skim off some calories this way.

It's very small inside, and there's really only two tables that are welcoming (the community tables at the back).  There were some nice two-tops, but they're spaced very close to one another, and most were taken by other customers.  I also try to find tables with good lighting around them, so that I may take decent pictures, so I was glad that a young man didn't mind sharing a 4-top community table with me.  (He had his laptop, so I didn't want to encroach on his personal space...)

One HUGE complaint I have?  The loud, creaky wooden floor!  I understand this used to be a home (like many other PHX eateries), but OMG, so disruptive!  I wondered how people could study or do computer work here, but now I realized that most people nowadays use earbuds while working and thus can ignore other sounds, but I'm not one of those people.  [On the rare occasion you see me wearing earbuds, I only have them on in case a call comes through.  The only music/sounds I listen to while dining out are the ones playing in the restaurant, bird songs (if patio-dining), or conversations of loud patrons.]  Having written all that, I'd return again, to enjoy more coffee and perhaps try the sandwiches.  Hope to be able to increase my rating to four stars- we'll see!"}
{"text":"Every time and I mean EVERYTIME I want a donut ice cream sandwich from the Melt ice cream stand outside they are ALWAYS out!! I find it especially funny when inside I look in the pastry case and there is a huge array of donuts  also employees there were not friendly at all, not the vibe you want from a \"unique\" coffee joint.."}
{"text":"Super cute coffee shop. I had a hot caramel mocha and the boyfriend had an iced caramel latte. Both were super yummy. Definitely will be coming back.

I tried their chocolate pecan fudge. Delicious. Pastries are $1 off after 7pm for happy hour. 

You can park in the parking garage next door for 2 hours for free."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Jobot since way back. It's been a neighborhood staple that serves up some pretty good jo and tasty bites. The new location is no different. Even though I moved away I make a point of visiting every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"i dragged my friends around on foot to find this place staffed by hipsters making good coffee and good crepes. i'm sure they, like i, thought that walk was worth it."}
{"text":"So, here's the story..... I don't know what people consider as good food or a \"hip environment\" but this place doesn't have either! The lack of cleanliness should have been a warning to just turn around and walk out, but I said \"no, lets try it... After all many people on yelp gave it 4 and 5 star reviews\".  To be honest, I was excited and that made me sad because I took my friend with me, due to the rave reviews.
First off, The food is nothing to write home about, ordered the breakfast \"joritto\", and was like mush in a tortilla (bless their little hearts), and there was a cake out in the open which was being sold by the slice - mind you, it was right next to the cash register! I mean, yuk! People talking and handling money over slices of cake for human consumption?! And don't get me started on the dirty seating, deteriorating wood floors, busted wall above the coffee bar, no working AC, and cob webs and dust all over the windows! I seriously almost threw up eating my breakfast burrito when I felt something crawl on the side of my foot. It was just a whack place in the heart of Phoenix that should be closed down... Or they should detox the place and clean up the staff, and improve hygiene standards before preparing food for people... :(

I am still in shock over the fact that I lowered my standards to eat here. Such a disappointment... If you're used to living in sanitary surroundings, DON'T COME HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Dude at the counter was cool, but service was botched. Don't care. Crepes were effin' amazing, and ENORMOUS. Sweet or savory, doesn't matter. They're awesome. And there's enough choices to keep you busy for weeks.

Cool, comfy, and unique. Would go there daily if I lived in the area. Love the converted home vibe."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee place closed recently so I tried the next closest place. I love a good dirty chai (chai with espresso in it). I ordered a large iced chai and wanted 2% milk, and was told they did not have it. So I asked if they could mix a bit of whole and skim, only to be told they ONLY had whole, almond or soy. I went with the almond milk. As for the chai, it was SO SPICY it gave me heartburn. WAY too much clove or nutmeg or something. On top of that there were LOTS of coffee grounds in the bottom of the cup. I REALLY wish I had tasted it before I drove off as I would have ordered something else or gotten my money back. I drank about 1/8 of it and had to throw it away."}
{"text":"Jobot is a gem. Seriously. Location, customer service and food selection are amazing. I've had lunch here twice in the past week and both times I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality food I had. The Curry was perfect. The. Shorty sounds alright but damn it was fantastic. And the customer service there is great. good vibes all around."}
{"text":"Super cute little place. Walked in to try a coffee. Got a caramel vanilla iced latte. Seriously so good. The vibe in there was nice and mellow. Everyone was super nice! Will def be back!!"}
{"text":"A Phoenix coffee shop open past 9pm? Praise the baby Jesus!"}
{"text":"This used to be Oliver's sophisticated bean. The espresso is still delicious, food is  good and better prices now. The atmosphere is chill and cozy. Good for getting work done or hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Honestly, JoBot just feels good. It's the type of place that welcomes anyone at almost anytime for almost any reason -- I come here to write, to catch up with friends, do homework, for a cup of tea after a hard day or a cup of coffee before a good one. I've lived in Phoenix/Tempe for three years, and although actively searching, I have not found somewhere that does a better job at creating a place to come back to. It's so...itself. I love the authenticity. 

And the people here are interesting. 

The food is great. The drinks are great. I'm not sure what else to say. JoBot is quality."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast on a Sunday morning around 9am. 
Wasn't crowded at all (+) - ordered a cold brew and the chilaquiles. The chilaquiles was described to me like a breakfast lasagna - I thought of it more like breakfast nachos. Either way, was heavily spiced in all the right ways and left a warm taste even after you're done chewing (+). Wasn't disappointed. Also huge portion - could've been shared (+). The cold brew was good too. Splashed a bit of soy and was happy. Usually cold brews come off aggressive to me, but this one was good. 

We also got a Jomama breakfast sandwich and the bottomless drip. Also delicious! 

Tips:
- Dogs welcome - saw a couple sitting outside (+).
- free garage parking in the garage off 3rd street - follow the Jobot sign for parking (++).

Edit: Why are the bathrooms so dark? ?"}
{"text":"Was in Paris 2 months ago and this crepe is as authentic as it comes. Dare I say possibly even better. I always go savory over sweet, but I may have to reconsider!"}
{"text":"I love Jobot...but...the girls really need to put their hair in nets. Pulling three long hairs off of my plate is kinda gross.

That's all. Everything else is good. Portions, food, friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hands down the best coffee spot in Phoenix! Super clean, cozy, everyone's nice, food is on point! Our go to spot every year from Texas! Not to mention the owner is super nice! Don't forget to check out his newly opened beer gallery across the street! Carries the most beer options in Phoenix thus far!"}
{"text":"My friend Jenny P (check out her reviews too!) took me to JoBot for lunch, and treated me to a crepe. Yum yum yum! I had the Black Bean Crepe, and ordered it with an egg ($1 extra). The crepe was served with a side of spicy red sauce, which was delicious!!! We sat outside, and enjoyed the spring weather under an umbrella. JoBot recently added canopies to provide more outdoor shade, and the owner said they're going to try to add a mister system too. I didn't have any room for dessert, so I'll have to come back for a sweet crepe next time."}
{"text":"Came in a few days ago, not knowing what I wanted to drink. The barista Devin was super nice and recommended me a drink, and made me the most amazing dirty chai latte! Thank you so much Devin!"}
{"text":"Solid coffee (plain). Food is meh."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! They have outdoor patios, so you can sit and enjoy your coffee or read a book. Also the people here are very friendly. Customer service is amazing they are willingly to help pick the prefect coffee for you. :) Best place in Phoenix. wish they had one in Tempe."}
{"text":"Why do these aholes act like I haven't been going there for years? Btw I've spent thousands on their crud coffee and they seem inconvenienced by me paying them money. I actually stopped going as much cuz the girls in there act like I am some sort of cro magnon. Sorry if I like things like NFL and showering! Apparently you do not, but please stop spreading your disdain at random. I get it. No time for pleasentries right? You suck Jobot life is better than you are acting"}
{"text":"Decent food, but HORRIBLE customer service. Good riddance!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with a friend. Started with a delicious cold brew coffee and ordered biscuits and gravy. Not traditional gravy, but a smokey, bold, spicy gravy was served on two fresh biscuits. Two over easy eggs and some potatoes on the side. Absolutely delightful. Friendly staff and cool atmosphere. Will definately return."}
{"text":"Nice place to sit n comfy"}
{"text":"Spacious with bar seating both indoors and outdoors. They have big picnic tables (shaded) outside so great for groups too.

I am more of a tea person and they offer plenty options and to my surprise they freshly brew it when ordered and it's delicious. I got peach tea which I really like here. 

Located on a quiet street even though lots of graffiti around. I was a little skeptical when I first drove in but super peaceful. Have the perfect atmosphere to relax or get work done. 24hrs on the weekend is awesome! 

Will have to try their crepes next time. Wish they displayed their food menu also. Or maybe I was unable to locate it"}
{"text":"I'm so sad! My co-workers actually took me to this place about a month ago and I took my husband last week, on their last day. I love how you walk in and you step into the past of where this house has been. You have a historical feeling with the chimney inside and that living room feeling.  

They have really delicious crepes and coffee, people there are so nice, and even outside with the table in the concrete yard with the lights hanging. It's really really sad to know they are tearing down these historical homes to bring in the corporate development to make it modern.

At least we got to enjoy a piece of this business before they closed down."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee and savory crêpes (ham, Swiss cheese, spinach, and Dijon is my go-to). If you can wait.

Short-staffed, this is not a late-night mecca of efficiency. Variable and inexplicable waits should be planned for and embraced."}
{"text":"Came here with little sister a while back and had the black tea and strawberries and creme crepe, both were delicious. The space is kinda small and rundown, but the tea was brewed perfectly. The barista knows what he's doing although he seems a little standoffish. My sister thinks he's rude, but she loves their chicken salad. Two drinks, salad and crepe came to over 20 bucks, so they are a bit overpriced. I'd come again if I found myself in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I like the vibe of the place and it is well known because of First Friday. But I think they rely on too much with the vibe they try to give off and not enough with customer service. They need to understand although me and other people may not be in their circle, I would like a sense of respect because I am still a paying customer. Maybe if they extended themselves outside of their inner circle, they can get more revenue."}
{"text":"Jobot never ceases to impress. Definitely have my favorite breakfast burritos, fantastic beverages and a great environment. This local spot curates craft coffee, beer, cocktails, and noms. Their new location features a spacious cafe with lots of comfy seating!"}
{"text":"It's my first time here and I'm in love! My breakfast sandwich was AMAZING! I will be craving that for the rest of the week, and my coffee was so good I couldn't leave without getting a second one to go. I highly recommend stopping in for breakfast."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow! A Yelper recommended this place for its crepes and coffee, and he was dead on. There are simply so many great choices on the crepes menu (check the back of the menu too for the savory crepes that are more the lunch or dinner type). 

I ordered Crepe F, which had apple fritter, honey and granola in or on my incredible tasting crepe. The almond milk latte was also excellent.

My group sat outside to enjoy the sunshine and the live music playing. Great place!"}
{"text":"They have Ms. Pac-Man, craft beer, scratch made biscuits and gravy, DJ's every Sunday for Beats & Brunch and the best cold brew coffee in Downtown Phoenix. Nuff said"}
{"text":"I've eaten at JoBot over 200 times since they've opened. I've never been sick once from eating or drinking there. Anyone who thinks the place is \"dirty\" doesn't understand that it's clean where it matters: in the kitchen. Check their health inspection history for yourself . Still bothered by the practical use of reclaimed materials, unfinished construction and make-shift furniture? Please take your pampered ass back to the suburbs and drown yourself in a bath in Purell, the regulars love this place."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great breakfast chorizo burrito. Coming from Tucson so yeah we take chorizo serious. Great coffee! Overall a great time!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots. Cool atmosphere and the savory crepes are great- I always go with the number 10. They have an awesome selection of Italian sodas and coffee too."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's hit its urban its me. They've added some things to their menu that I haven't tried and today I tried it, loved the green white chile cheese fries, DELISH! I also myself got a chai latte iced with almond milk pretty awesome chai here folks. Service was awesome matched the environment and feel but very friendly! With my chai I got a savory crepe for breakfast cause I was craving it! And I got the number 2, it had chorizo mozzarella topped with a n over easy egg I think! It was fantastic I loved it! I definitely would recommend all my friends and future friends here! Especially if you are in the downtown Roosevelt area! Plus it's all local which I love!"}
{"text":"I thought it was ok, hubby thought it was spectacular.  I tried to order my standard soy vanilla latte but they were out of vanilla - to me that's like a hamburger joint being out of ketchup.  So I got a mocha instead - nice coffee flavor, but the chocolate didn't taste so special.  Hubby had a cappuccino and would definitely get it again."}
{"text":"This place was sooooo good. I wasn't expecting much from the food with it being a coffee shop but we were pleasantly surprised! I got the yellow curry and was seriously better than a traditional Thai spot, we also got the quesadilla and it was one of the best ever! Defiantly a must try!!"}
{"text":"Rumors of Jobot's death were greatly exaggerated! Mere days after closing doors on the iconic 5th street, they somehow lucked into a space previously owned by another failing coffee shop. Its reemergence was hasty, with old signage from the establishment's past life still fixed above the entrance. Juxtaposed with an ironic \"NOT JOBOT\" sign, there seemed to be a bit of an identity crisis as the wooden, kitsch, and artful charm were supplanted by sleek and steely modernity of Roosevelt's 'renewal'. But is this still the coffee shop I've known and enjoyed and visited a million times, despite everything being replaced? 

It's like the Ship of Theseus, if you retained reliable, bespectacled baristas. 

I assure you the coffee is as tasty and invigorating as always. Everything you order will be good, but I really do believe you should stick with the Sunrise, an avant-garde mixture of espresso and orange juice. Delicious! 

The food has perhaps retained more consistency than ever! No more hit-or-miss dishes, my order has been good every time. Get the crepes. Get the BLT with avocado first. I must add their red salsa is heavenly, and is crazy good despite its mildness. 

The most noteworthy change here is the bar. It has evolved from a selection of several brews offered occasionally to a concept that has been fully realized. It even boasts a small cocktail menu! And while you can obviously find a more expansive or refined selection elsewhere, it's more than what one could hope for in a coffee shop. 

I completely understand the disappointment from long-time patrons. It just doesn't *feel* the way it's supposed to, and that may hamper your enjoyment for quite some time. I will always miss the creaky floors and broken doors with graffiti and 3am conversations on the patio, but doting on them is a lost cause. This is the now, and judging Jobot on its merits alone in this new space leaves me with just one reasonable conclusion - it's totally worth."}
{"text":"Before and after pounding obscure craft beers next door, JoBot is always a good idea. The soy mocha is one of the best in the business. More importantly their menu doesn't mess around when it comes to grabbing some late night eats. I recommend the BLT, with its lemon zest cream cheese, but more importantly, the salad that comes with it. Or the vegan salad. Or the crepes. Or the tacos. 

Just order anything. It's all good. 

So just a recap, this is why I'm giving Jobot 5 stars:


+Open late
+Awesome patio
+Quick service
+Good value on quality food and joe"}
{"text":"Always a fan of the late night festivities that go on here when the bars close.  The food is always great but depending on the time you'll have a wait.  Just be patient and you'll love what you get."}
{"text":"I've been to Jobot about 5 times since I moved to Phoenix less than a year ago. On the quest for coffee shops/cafes to do some work in the Phoenix metro area, Jobot is pretty high up on my list.

I always get the iced mocha latte and it never disappoints! Since I come here to do work with my laptop, I always try to aim for seats near the outlets but just like any other place, I wish there were more of them! They are open late, which is when I usually come, so thankfully this hasn't been that big of an issue for me since there are less people. Wifi is reliable. The overall vibe is chill. Some parts of the indoor area have pretty dim lighting, so if you're doing some reading, outdoors might be the better option.

Parking hasn't been too bad. I park on the ground floor of the apartment building that Jobot is a part of. The downside is that it is 2 hour max for parking. I'm not sure how strict they enforce this during the day, but since I come 6 pm or later, this hasn't been an issue for me if I stay longer."}
{"text":"Amazing crepes, good coffee, open late. I come here at least once a week. Highly recommend the ham and spinach or chocolate/peanut butter crepe! Love this place."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. I usually love these little hole in the wall places owned by locals and. This place just didnt do it for me. It was a little dirty, the workers were all pretty distracted and taking their sweet time and the music was SOOOO loud for 7am.

Sigh, i wish it had lived up to my expectations."}
{"text":"I have been eating here and enjoying cartel coffee since before you were too cool to crack a smile or I don't know be polite. unkept hair and a vacant expression doesn't do much for my restaurant experience.

I have been very forgiving because I loved this place when we found it after you opened. I came for the biscuits and gravy and got an enormous pubic hair on top a few months ago. That was my first bad experience. Not because of the hair because let's be honest, shit happens and we all shed, but there was no apology. No omg that is awful let me get you a new one!!!! Instead the guy with perfected hipster hair said oh i don't think it's a pube just a wiry hair. seriously??

I came three weeks ago with my 5lb dog. I carried him in so I could order and he would not freak out. The manager just stared at me like I had active head lice and monotonously took my order. She then said you can wait outside. LOL I know I had a dog and I wanted nothing more than to get outside. But you still say thank you for buying something in my establishment or at least say hey...jerk...get that dog out of here. On this occasion the breakfast potatoes were not cooked. I said nothing because I didn't want them anyway.

So today I stop in because I have a paper to write. First of all nobody smiles, nobody says hey, nothing. Then I order and wait quite awhile. So I see her with my food and smile and say I think that's mine. I get no smile in return. Instead she says you didn't take a number. i'd have known if you had taken a number. And she leaves without giving me the silverwear. The biscuits were stale and dry but again I said nothing because this time I know I am over it.

You know your crepes are decent, coffee is awesome, but your people are unfriendly and you are not half as cool as you think you are. I work too hard for my money. I'm gonna go to phoenix market, they sell the same coffee and never put pubes in my food. They also say thank you."}
{"text":"Cute spot we decide to stop by and get some coffee and something sweet. Got the crepe and it was good. The CHAI TEA Latte took 23min and even after asking other drinks still came out except mine. After I was done with the crepe my chai was done. It was watered down :/

DO NOT CoME HERE"}
{"text":"Freaking BEST baker in AZ. Sampled the Strawberry and Almond Donuts with a friend. Both were beyond our expectations. Almond was my favorite!"}
{"text":"I first tried this place in order to see a friend perform with his band. The crepes brought me back for return visits, as they really really hit the spot. This place is janky in a good way... down-to-earth people serving and patronizing the joint. Just the kind of place for an indie band jam and poetry slam. And it's right next to The Lost Leaf if you need to switch from stimulants to depressants (or vice versa). The owners next door at Lost Leaf are totally cool with you bringing your awesome JoBot crepes over to consume with your beer.

This is a great example of local flavor that I hope propagates in downtown Phoenix. It's places like this that make me linger longer after work and put off my commute eastward for some cool vibes with the local ilk."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place ...

Like in my previous reviews for coffee shops and the like I look for good coffee and a great studying atmosphere. Upon my visit I came in, grabbed a cold brew and tried studying. Wasn't very busy in the shop, so sound was not an issue. I found my cold brew to be just alright, but a more watered down than I would have liked. I also that it was odd to watch them make cold brew/steep tea right on the counter in an industrial container, swirling the bag around the water. Talk about fresh though, right?

I didn't find the environment that great, I thought it lacked outlets for those using laptops. The table was wobbly and the chairs weren't that comfortable. Like the rest of the shops and cafes in downtown that are quirky and cool, I found JoBot kind of dingy.

Perhaps cold brew was a bad option, as well as staying in here. From the looks of it, JoBot looks like a grab & go kind of place. As for what other reviewers are saying, looks like Chai and the Crepes are a big hit here."}
{"text":"The rating is more 3.75/5 than 3/5. 

Its one of those hole-in-the-walls that people go to for some latenight coffee and food. I specifically go there for only one reason - Drunk food when I am done with Lost Leaf ! oh wait or when I go to frist fridays and get drunk as well (despit eating at the bazillion food trucks :)). 

Why? I dont know, its one of the only real late late night food places that's open and that's not Mcdy or Jack in the box. That Said, I would still prefer Aside of Heart or Nachebot to this place for the food. I have had the crepes here before and they are good (check the pics). doesn't anything taste goooood when youz drunk? :P. wait a min, what's the yardstick to compare these crepes with? what r the other good places with crepes here? I have eaten something else here before too, I can't remember now though I think its veggie quesedilla/burrito? I liked em too. But hey you pay 7-10$ for the drunk food here"}
{"text":"My relationship with this coffee shop is more complicated than my relationship with my boyfriend. I stated going here less than six months ago and they have changed locations, management, menus, prices so many times I just can't even keep it straight. Every time they make a change that I dislike and make me upset, they come out with something new that I love that makes up for it. I just wish they would still have the monte cristo crepe. I love their Elvis crepe with the bacon and peanut butter and yesterday I tried their udon  noodles and it was sooo yummy. Their cold brew is their own coffee roast and it is so tasty and they have me addicted, so when ever I'm unhappy about the food, prices or location, I still will always keep coming here because you jus can't get coffee like that anywhere else. I also love all their pastries and that they always have vegan options."}
{"text":"Best plain latte I've ever tasted.
Ambience isn't much to speak of, old house but the breakfast sandwich was spectacular. 
Prices are very reasonable.
Barista was a craftsman!"}
{"text":"Great crepes, very yummy, good espresso, but I do not like the vibe in this place. There was a lot of body parts art. Some of us are not up for fallices and breasts with our crepes and espressos. Felt a little dirty too meaning clean not moral. So, a mixed review for this one. Was not amazing enough to draw me back in."}
{"text":"5 stars all day (and all night)! Chill, eclectic, funky, smooth...legit! Food, coffee, ambience, JOBOT has it. Reminds me of Church St back home, downtown Burlington, Vermont. 

Short review, no need for anything longer...if you like great food and great beverages then you need to come here. :D"}
{"text":"Eh ....this place definitely is not very customer service oriented ..but however the reason I'm here is because im hungry. Super urban Hipster which immmm soooooooooooooooo over .... was cute for a min when you actually genuinely meet and see a true urban Hipster not a bunch of wanna bees dressed like hipsters ....super tried !! And tired! Anyhow ill post a review on the food ...once its ready still waiting .... too bee continued ........"}
{"text":"Delicious egg sandwich and good strong coffee  Music is played loud on Sunday afternoons so it's not the best place to study."}
{"text":"The staff here is always friendly & welcoming. There are a lot of beverages options, but if there's something you want that's not on the menu, ask. There's a good chance they can make it for you. The pastries are always fresh & delicious. I have yet to eat an actual meal here, but I've heard nothing but great things."}
{"text":"Checked out JoBot for the first time this morning with my husband and son.  I got a delicious chai latte and my husband had the drip.  Kiddo had a strawberry-almond scone which the three of us devoured.  Loved the patio... can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Parking for this place is in a garage a short walk around the corner. The owner was super nice and struck up some conversation with us which I enjoyed. The barista wasn't the most personable but she was still polite. I asked for an iced macchiato, however she told me that they only make the traditional ones. I don't know why it would've been an issue to accommodate my request seeing as I just wanted an iced version of something already on the menu. I ended up getting an iced white chocolate mocha which was good and the prices were very reasonable. They seem to have a large selection of beers as well, but we stopped in for a morning cup of coffee. I absolutely loved the industrial atmosphere and neat decor they had. I would go back!"}
{"text":"A few of my favorite things:

Places that seem hidden, crepes, and definitely coffee.

This place has never disappointed. The Baristas are friendly and explain the art of coffee to you, the crepes are delightful.. The Chai was OK. but I'm rating this based on Coffee."}
{"text":"My friends always take me here when I visit Phoenix. And for a good reason. The drinks are tasty and they're open late! Plenty of patio seating, which is perfect for those cooler nights in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great coffee and the biscuits and gravy are the best. Also all of the baked goods are always moist and delicious never too sweet"}
{"text":"Cool little hipster spot. Espresso was good. I love those crepes. Not the best I've ever had but really good. I like the spot, right in the arts district downtown. Always have fun when I'm there. Good place. Good times. Great late night food and coffee."}
{"text":"Extremely hipster, I wanted to stay and get some reading done but it didn't feel the most welcoming. Aside from that, the baked goods were amazing! Major compliments to whoever is back there, the lavender chocolate chip cookies and lemon-rosemary cake were fantastic. Butter is certainly present, but they are worth it. I'd visit again, but keep it as a to-go order."}
{"text":"First off, what a great addition to the neighborhood. We needed a coffee shop that wasn't a weird, haphazard array of junk scattered about(Conspire.) We also needed to be rid of that shiester Derek who ran Hoodride, so 5 stars for Jobot for killing two birds with one stone. 

This is actually a neat little coffee shop with a bar where you can sit and feel like you are at the pub but drink coffee instead. I haven't seen a coffee counter since Drip on 7th Street closed. Huge kudos for that and another five stars.

Unfortunately, they were out of coffee on my visit. The guy behind the counter was very cordial and offered to brew a pot but I was in a bit of a rush to get back to work. I was happy to order an Americano, but I felt that still charging me full price for it was kind of unfortunate, and the quality and taste was less than exceptional. Generally, if a place is out of something, they will offer you something else and charge you the price of what you originally wanted. And generally, a two-shot Americano will keep me feeling awake and energetic, but this was very watered down and didn't taste that great either.

I'll definitely hang out here when I need a fix, but more because it's just a neat little place, and not because of it's coffee. Otherwise, Giant and Lux are far superior when it comes to the drinks and they are a little fancier."}
{"text":"This place gave me the crepes. And they were delightful!

My friends and I stopped by one late October evening after catching a show at Valley Bar and were glad we did. What better way to end a great day than with the most important meal of the day, breakfast."}
{"text":"Coffee is fantastic and the crepes are good. Service is no different than what I've experienced at other \"hipster\" hangouts; it's a bit standoffish. They warm up to you after awhile though."}
{"text":"Dropped into JoBot Coffee several weeks ago with a friend and was pleasantly surprised to find they are located in a historic phoenix home converted into a coffee bar. The barista's were courteous and attentive and they serve a great Americano. Yeah, I'm a fan and I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Leaving Matt's low on caffeine and realizing Jiffy-Lube and Chase were not yet open to accomplish my afternoon errands I decided to next pay a visit to Jobot Coffee - a place I'd heard both good (music, coffee) and less-than-stellar (patrons, service) things about and pointing my GPS to the address I at first wondered if I'd mistyped; to say the least the area is residential and unassuming, but upon seeing the \"Coffee\" sign I assumed I was in the right place, parked, and walked in as Sigur Ros Takk played on the outdoor speakers.

Half knowing what to expect from a house-come-coffee shop named the \"best place to take a scenester\" by the local media I entered the doors of JoBot to the aromatics of coffee and a bar populated by the partially hung-over and half-shaven but surprisingly also to smiling faces and families sitting with their Ipads as the kitchen turned out respectable looking sweet and savory crepes.  Not realizing that the space served food in addition to coffee I was greeted by a young lady at the bar who asked if I wanted a menu or if I knew what I'd like I deferred for a moment while I perused the options - eventually settling on an iced Toddy and a pair of pastries made in-house that morning - a $10 tab including a $1 tip.

With the space almost intentionally run-down looking and tables, benches, and chairs strewn throughout three rooms I found bench and 2 tables near the back where a defunct piano sat alongside a family of four and after getting out my books took my first sip of the Toddy - a rich blend from Cartel with a bit of stone-fruit up front and deep chocolate notes on the finish before moving on to my pastries - a $2.50 Strawberry \"DohNut\" and a $4.00 slice of Dr. Pepper Cake.  Beginning first with the donut - a small ring that was possibly baked rather than fried given the total lack of grease, rich cake-like texture, and pockets of berries plus an ample coat of not-too-sweet strawberry glaze I have to say the it was more 'muffin' than donut, but all in all it was still quite good.  Moving next to the cake - dense, fudgy, and just bitter enough between the cocoa and the nuts to balance the saccharine sweetness of the soda it has been a long long time since I ordered something as simple as \"chocolate cake\" and while there is no doubt I could have made something like this at home it was a really nice reminder of how good 'comfort food' can sometimes be - particularly with really good coffee in a relaxed setting."}
{"text":"Their mocha is disappointing.. no taste of coffee at all.. it  neither tastes like a chocolate drink.. to sum, it's bland.. the price is also on the high end.. for the price of their small mocha is the same price for the medium mocha at One coffee.."}
{"text":"We went for crepes and we had crepes and we were pleased.
That would be an understatement, we were in heaven. The crepes were to die for! They had flavor that oozed more flavor. Each and every bite was a gastronomic masterpiece of flavor. Did I already mention the flavor?
The coffee that accompanied the crepes was also wonderful. Not quite exquisite, just wonderful.
When we arrived the music being played was David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust album and the DJ outside was blasting out some awesome Santana tunes.
And the sun was shining and life was good.
This place is an all around A #1, five star coffee shop with a cool vibe. 
This is definitely on my return as soon as possible list. 
Bring your bike, your electronic communication device (or a good book) and enjoy this wonderful oasis of cool eats in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great, great coffee. I haven't tried the crepes but from what I've heard they are good. My hesitancy with giving it 4 or 5 stars is the cleanliness or lack there of. I like the local charm , but the owner should look to spruce things up  bit"}
{"text":"One of the best iced lattes I've ever had!  I drank it so fast I thought about ordering another one.  It's a good thing I didn't order a second one because I would have never gone to sleep.  I love a caffeine-filled latte.  It's in an old downtown house and there are tables in the front yard.  It was nice to relax outside and enjoy the beautful day with a delicious drink.  There's so many great reviews about the crepes, I can't wait to go back and try them!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to follow other reviews of this place in saying that It's not what I expected. 
This was one of the places friends recommended to me knowing that I have high standards when it comes to coffee. 
The cappuccino I ordered was bad, though. Overextracted, burnt and sour."}
{"text":"Always great to come back. I miss the brunches i used to attend weekly. I came for a peach black tea, and it was on point as usual. I like to add a little of agave into my iced tea, better than sugar. The staff and the patrons are always so kind. The service is great and the food is delicious. I wish I could live downtown just so I can live near jobot."}
{"text":"I've been coming to jobot for years, and recently the quality has really declined. The venue is cooler sure but I paid an additional $2 today for a crepe that is only 2 inches wide? They used to be full and delicious but now I'm paying more for just boring dough. I've left pretty upset and hungry the last few times and I probably won't come back. Sorry to see you go jobot. You used to be my #1."}
{"text":"Coffee was average. I did get the hipster vibe when I found the place. Did not get a chance to try the food but probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"My co-worker ranted about this breakfast spot but couldn't tell me the name, just location. He said the pancakes melted in your mouth and you didn't even need syrup. Luckily there was yelp to help narrow it down and I found JoBot!! Very welcoming, great environment, and good food. The pancakes were delicious and the orange juice was fresh squeezed. 

I know the area and environment isn't to kid oriented, but a booster would've been nice. My one year old sat in my lap and we ate together."}
{"text":"Was in search of another local business to give my monies to and saw good reviews for Jobot Coffee in downtown Phoenix and I experienced poor customer service. From the time I posted videos of the coffee shop's aesthetic to my \"hangry\" mood kicking in, I spent a whopping 45 minutes waiting on a breakfast sandwich. When I asked the cashier for a refund, he did just that. No apology, no ownership, no customer service. Take your dollars else where my friends. Looks like I'll be back at my favorite coffee shop. I'm pissed and hungry af"}
{"text":"This place has changed slowly for the better.  They have not lost the charm of their rustic roots as they have literally opened their space to accommodate their growing fan base.   
Their food is spot on.  It is not just about the crepes here you can get those same items as tacos, sandwiches or salads.  But I stick to the crepes.  Their desserts are made in house and are pretty lovely.  Their daily specials are usually my go to as I have tried just about everything on their menu.  

If I could give 6 stars it would be for their CHAI!  Oh those m*th#rF*cK#rs have ruined me for life by serving me some of THE BEST CHAI EVER!! I can no longer go to any other place and have the swill they sell as chai. JoBot brews the tea fresh and they have their own spice blend that they add at the initiation of each order.  That being the case I ask for it to be extra spicy and they add a few extra shakes of that magical blend of spices.  
A squeeze of honey and a half pump of vanilla syrup round out this luscious libation.  They only had 2 milk choices, soy and regular,  in the early phases of the establishment.  Now as they develop,they have added almond.  Thank you! 

If you are looking for a super early morning munch or super late night eats, this is one of the VERY FEW places in the area that can accommodate that need.  

Don't forget your roots JoBot.  Don't loose your charm or sell out to \"the man\".   You are one of the businesses that anchors RoRo and represents the charm and character that is this 'hood."}
{"text":"A great find based on Yelp ratings for stopping when driving through Phoenix. I'll definitely stop through again.

Delicious crepes. Even when another group destroyed their banana reserve and we had to do the strawberries instead. (We got a side of the ricotta and jam to soften the blow. That ricotta is awesome!)

Breakfast burrito was generous, with a nice balance of the fillings (pico, potatoes, etc.) and the breakfast sandwich, while not as big, was yummy and quickly devoured.

We really enjoyed speaking with the baristas - welcoming was using by another Yelper and I've got to agree. Not all of the available art was to my taste but I love seeing walls with original pieces."}
{"text":"Kharli made the best Old Fashioned. She's the best server.  Other people there are OK too."}
{"text":"Today was my fourth time here and the food was amazing as always. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and my boyfriend had the steak and eggs. I ordered my sandwich w.o tomatoes but it came with them. Not a big deal, just picked them off. The lattes and mochas are delicious. It's nice because you can bring your dog on the patio. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because I DONT ENJOY having smoke blown in my face while I eat."}
{"text":"This place fits the hipster and urban vibe perfectly!  Their italian sodas, coffee, and Chicken Chop Salad (one of the freshest salads I've ever eaten) are all amazing! I love coming there to study, hangout, and eat!! It's open basically all of the time and is pretty decently priced in general and especially for the quality."}
{"text":"I was staying in an airbnb next door to this place.  I was in need of some breakfast and coffee.  I found this wonderful gem, the great thing is that it is not only a coffee place but it has a bar as well!! The staff is so nice and it is wonderful seeing the owner working in the kitchen and being part of his place.  If you are in the area I would check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Chicken curry: It was pretty good! Wish there was a bigger portion, or maybe I was just hungry and it was good! New location is great, good diverse crowd, modern/hipster vibe, good city views."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee spot in all of Phoenix! People here are always cool, lots of cool art, the coffee is delicious. They have good and a bar as well but I only get coffee here. People gather here with friends to chat or with their laptops to do work. Friendly staff. Not always the most attentive but nice! Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Horrendous hipster \"coffee\" house playing obnoxious music. 

Probably the worst cappuccino I've ever had - incredibly bitter. 

The Nutella crepe was nothing special - they couldn't even take the time to distribute the Nutella evenly so there were giant blobs here and there and some parts completely lacking."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. It's a downtown staple so if you are visiting, make sure you drop by. Located on 5th street, you can experience the true heart of the downtown artists community in one place (although there are legitimate pockets of culture all over downtown). 

Very good iced coffee, delicious cinnamon sugar VEGAN cookies, and drip coffee to make you JUMP! JUMP! These are the only things I have here, but everything looks good. 

If you're open minded and friendly, come here! You'll be in good company."}
{"text":"This is in that cool neighborhood that reminds me Seattle or another big city with history, but nothing like Phoenix.  Very hippy style.  The building is an old converted house (from the 1940s?) that looks like something out of an old Boston or Seattle neighborhood, but not Phoenix.  The menu is hippy-ish as well.  They have these strange wraps and crepes.  I had a philly one.  It was okay.  I think next time I would get a more dessert style crepe with cinnamon and sugar or something.  Phillys don't really work as crepes.  Interesting little place worth stopping in just to check out how weird it is.  Lol."}
{"text":"Ah Jobot..... I have always wanted to be a fan......It just seems like such a 'cool' place.  I've visited periodically over the years and most recently visited their new location in the old Oliver's coffee shop. The new location is an interesting mix of Jobot's old style and a more modern coffee shop. The baristas are friendly and helpful..... I just don't think their coffee tastes that good..... I know that's a personal preference thing, but Cartel coffee just doesn't do it for me. I do want to return to try their food again and possibly visit the bar, but I think their coffee is just ok."}
{"text":"I came here this morning with the BF to use a living social deal I had bought recently. I was really excited to try this place, as it was crazy busy the last time I was there (on first friday), so I passed on it. This place is really cool, it has a nice atmosphere and feels homey and friendly. The whole street is like a little community, so it has a good feel, and I like to support that kind of business. I ordered an iced latte and the 'cannoli' crepe (ricotta, choco chips, almonds) and the BF got a hot latte and the PB, raspberry jam, and banana crepe. They were a bit chewy, but good flavor. The coffee was very good, it is made by cartel coffee, which I always like. I would definitely come back here to try different flavors and to drink yummy coffee."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed, I absolutely loved the last location and now I will never go again. Their menu downgraded drastically, along with customer service. I ordered a crepe and my boyfriend got bacon. They put them in the same box so I got bacon grease all over my crepe (I'm a vegetarian) and he got powdered sugar covered bacon. I'm really sad I can't go to my favorite casual spot for some amazing pancakes and awesome vibes anymore. Should have stayed put."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this coffee shop after an all-day out and about excursion in South Mountain and Desert Botanical Garden. All I wanted was to refuel a little before meeting up with friends for dinner.  Then I saw the magical word \"crepes\" as the car drove by this part of downtown. 

I like local places, especially ones with characters. This fits the bill.  I had a giant iced coffee for $3.50 and a classic crepe (lemon juice and powder sugar) for $3.50 as well.  It beats any Starbucks or whatever chain there is. We sat outside, and see that this place must appeal to the artsy crowd. There were plenty of people drawing and doing their \"thang\" on their laptop.   The crepe was ok, probably should have gone with a more elaborate option (they have a lot of savory and sweet options for $8). I was at this point on a caffeine high since I sucked down that coffee like it was water.

Inside wasn't air conditioned and didn't have much comfy seating options, but it offers the important function of charging my dying phone. 

Visitors: visit this area, there are lots of cool little joints (coffee, shops, restaurants, and a bodega) and stop by JoBot for a cup of Jo"}
{"text":"Big fan of the music selection  the environment was pretty sweet and the mix of demographics that were in there were pretty cool to see. Everyone from all walks of life just enjoying being under the same roof as everyone else"}
{"text":"So I checked out this place with a coworker of mine and we will defnitely be going back.  The area is decent.  The coffee house is quite literally a house that serves coffee.  They do have a menu and we checked out the crepes which were delicious as well.  The setting outside makes you feel at home in this hipster kind of area.  I felt like I was in my front yard just chatting with my girlfriend.  

There is one slight downfall and that was while we were there a few homeless people were lurking and I had the wonderful fortune of watching use the restroom across the street.  I will say with that it does not deter me from going back to this place and trying more of the menu or drinks.  The people were moderately friendly and I like that side of town in general.  

Strawberry and banana crepes with Nutella (delicious!)."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that people think is cool but beneath the surface there's no substance- food and drink is subpar or mediocre and service is really bad."}
{"text":"My new favorite place!  I've been there 4 times now, and am 4/4.  The Turkey Melt is bomb as are the Crapes.  Looking forward to navigating through the entire menu in my near future!"}
{"text":"I generally avoid this spot. With so many great independent coffee shops in Phoenix, putting up with the \"too cool for school\" attitude of this place just doesn't seem worth it. Per a friends request, I ignored previous bad experiences and decided to give them another chance. After ordering a latte, I realized they didn't have honey on their condiment bar. When I asked for honey I was literally scolded for not ordering the honey latte as the barista rudely squeezed honey into my cup spilling my drink all over the counter. 1. There are tactful ways to communicate information that seem to be beyond the baristas intellectual abilities and 2. I'm sorry that your parents gave you the basic white girl name of Chandler and you feel like you need to be rude to maintain your street cred. This place tries way too hard to be the bastion of cool and unfortunately it's nothing more than yet another hipster with a parliament light and bad attitude. Get over yourself Jobot."}
{"text":"Don't go here. I got the peach black tea and it tasted like nothing. So weak. I thought the daily brunch special was good and substantial. Everyone else ordered from the menu. The portions were miniscule.  My friends hungry man breakfast had a tablespoon of potatoes. The outdoor patio had a homeless man smoking and feeding the pigeons. He was ranting to himself"}
{"text":"I can't wait to go try the crepes! I was only here to get a quick drink.
Sooooooo glad for the patio! Can't wait to take Dexter. :}"}
{"text":"Crepe's heaven! Super hipster. nice comfy place to relax and have a bite, or some coffee. awesome service and simple atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning and there was a sizeable crowd, but not too crowded. It was a colder day, so not a lot of people sitting outside. Our group of 4 was able to find a table in the back corner after ordering our crepes. There was a much larger group seated already so this place can definitely handle groups.

I had the Philly crepe and the banana nutella crepe. For the price, it can't be beat. I think they have a small kitchen and thus the wait can be long. $7 for all savory crepes and $6 for sweet, the wait is worth it. The service is great and this street is cool, being inside of an old house. Parking was easy. The scene is definitely hipster."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is hands down one of my favorite breakfast spots. I go here before class in the mornings and get the Chorizo buscuits and gravy. It comes with a side of really yummy potatoes covered in what tastes like a taziki sauce. I also love how even though I get a iced mocha it still has the coffee taste I like, unlike most places where they are smothered in syrup. Get here early because they do get packed."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a date night and we had such a nice time. We both enjoyed a cappuccino and they were on point. The barista even remade one for us before we even treated it because she wanted to make sure it was perfect. I love that this place is open late. They have great music. As some have mentioned, it is a hipster vibe, however, not at all pretentious. Everyone is very friendly and the crowd diverse. I will go back to try their breakfast."}
{"text":"the greatest coolest place i discovered on my visit to phoenix! crepes or tacos with cool combinations that are italian or greek.. loved the concept and the food itself!"}
{"text":"I love this place!
There's this wonderful Barista who has dark shorter hair, she's tall with glasses and tattoos. Don't let her dark and ominous description detour you...She makes super awesome drinks! Sometimes she has a riddle prepared! Once I needed a jolt after studying for finals and she made me a drink and wrote a encouraging note with the a werthers original attached to it.

I was all like \"Santa is that you?\" And she was like \"nope just your friendly local barista!\"
I'm not well on my way to getting my doctorate because of the amazing staff and drinks at Jobot!!"}
{"text":"I first spent money here when I found myself stranded downtown on a Friday night. \"How late are you open on the weekends?\" I asked, \"24 hours\", the energetic and gregarious pixie behind the counter proclaimed with great pride.  It has been a love affair ever since.

Good coffee, great crepes(and I grew up on a crepe farm, I know), and an atmosphere that could be described as \"Twisted...but in a good way.\"

My only word of caution would be to keep in mind that this place is a loud party, all of the time, so if you are easily distracted by music and well styled bohemians, then you may want to stick to the library to write your blogs or do your homework."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place randomly since my sorority sister and I were in the area. We weren't big breakfast fans and I was really craving eggs. They had awards for their crepes so of course, since most of the items on the small menu were heavy anyway, we decided on sweet crepes with strawberries and nutella and I got eggs on the side. Surprisingly the crepe was delicious. It was so warm, soft, and fluffy with sweet strawberry and nutella balancing it perfectly because it wasn't too sweet. I also thought that the side of egg would come with only 1 egg however, it came with 2 and was cooked perfectly. And to top it all off, it was pretty cheap. This diner is definitely a hidden gem and has potential for success.

If you're in the area, definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"More 3.5 than 3.  Went with a living social coupon, so I got to order lots of things to cover the 20.  Had the turkey pesto mozzarella crepe, and i must say, it was excellent. The  staff recommended it, and it did not disappoint.  I appreciated that he was more excited about recommending it than me ordering it.  Also ordered a vanilla scone, and it was pretty good as well.  I drank a  mocha, which I didn't find that special, hence minus 1 star.  the other star deduction was for the crazy heat inside...they don't have ac.  However, I'll say that their food is pretty solid...and, when the weather eventually cools a little, that star will go up.  

I also had a machaca crepe. That was really good. The pico de gallo had amazing flavor and spice...much better than 95% of the Mexican restaurants I've been to in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Pricing on signs in-store are never accurate. A girl who goes by the name of \"Gypsy\" that has been at the counter every time we have patronized this business at their new location is very rude, lackadaisical, and very much so intimidated by the African women she so desperately tries to imitate and who's culture she appropriates. We will never patronize this business again after the poor customer service we have received and the very non-caring and non-customer service oriented attitude we received from the owner."}
{"text":"The food was really good but I can't stand restaurants that expect you to clean up your own dishes. If I had known I wouldn't have tipped."}
{"text":"Great coffee, friendly staff, and fair prices. Was surprised it was in a multi use building, but that didn't take away much from the overall feel. Pretty big food, alcohol, and coffee menu"}
{"text":"I go here once a month on First Friday. The coffee is good- really good. But whenever I ask questions about the menu - I get accosted. I like sweet coffee drinks! So sue me! My recent trip was with a flippant young woman. She was more interested in gossiping than providing customer service. 

I also ordered cake balls--- which were yummy. Their food is great.

My point is, the product is quality  - but when you have to worry about interrupting the staff to order - there is a problem. The product is good, my latte was a work of art-- but I don't want to be uncomfortable to get it.

Please work on your customer service Jobot! Even though the product is good- it's hard to give you more stars with the unfriendliness."}
{"text":"Love it. Menu is greatly expanded since I was last here and its fantastic. Lots of options from crepes to sandwiches to omelettes to baked goods. Of course full coffee bar. I also love that they're open all night Friday and Saturday. Five stars!"}
{"text":"Rating primarily for vibe, character of the place, location, and nice staff.  Great place to study.  I confess I was disappointed with the messy espresso shot that was pulled for me, and the coffee was just ok too.  Everything else made me happy though."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab a quick coffee. The salads are very tasty and overall has a very positive vibe. 

The one thing that I would mention is that the baristas can be rude at times, a few times being approached with a \"What do you want?\" versus a polite \"what can I get for you?\" There is a distinction with the service and customer service but I support local business."}
{"text":"Oh my God this is the worst bathroom I've ever been in. Glad they are open for all these crazy drunks on First Friday but while they really need some more servers and help to clean up the place"}
{"text":"Very nice location and great space. The iced chai latte was pretty good too. Why the 3 stars and not 5? They had a DJ the early afternoon I came to watch YouTube videos on my tablet. His music selection was quite good which I can rarely say about most such events. However, this is still primarily a cafe and not a club, unless that's what they're going for. Besides, it was early Sunday afternoon. I measured the sound pressure level several times with an app on my phone and it averaged between 87 decibels (average motorcycle) to 90 decibels (average food blender) inside so I did my work outside in the heat. Unless you're among obnoxious drunk loud talkers, you will have a very hard time hearing each other here. If I come here again, I'll wear ear plugs or go down the street and choose from among many other places if it's loud again. There are many non-club venues such as cafes that have a DJ playing these days, but they usually play at a reasonable volume or as background music. This DJ however needs to turn the volume WAY down!"}
{"text":"Short bar girl was beyond rude. Very unwelcoming and had a bad attitude. I would never go back, as I thought the service was horrible and very unprofessional. When I asked for a manger, I was told one was not on duty. I am waiting for a call back from one."}
{"text":"Sweet little place in Phoenix - very cozy. Counter service is very friendly and our hot cocoas were just about the best around. I had a simple lemon & powdered sugar crepe. It was cooked with a delicate hand and almost a tiny bit eggy in flavor. Smashing. Hubby had one with bacon, turkey, sweet cherries, and cheese - oh my goodness  - what an amazing combination. Sweet and savory and absolutely rich with flavor. I wouldn't hesitate to stop in again for the relaxed vibe, friendly service, and good eats."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee and some good food, too.  I love crepes for breakfast but I have never before had crepes with Machaca or chorizo... and served with salsa that had a good kick to it, too.  The hubby appreciated the fact that you could get all the same options with corn tortillas instead.  We did not try the scones but they looked fantastic."}
{"text":"The coffee is really good. The iced coffee is especially good.

The crepes are pretty hilarious concoctions. My friends and I call them \"stoner crepes.\" They're REALLY good, just very strange. My favorite is the #9. Just get the #9 and you'll have a good rest of your day.

The atmosphere is cool. I agree with most of the reviewers here, it can seem a little pretentious right off the bat, but the more you go.. the less you care about that."}
{"text":"FINALLY we find a 24 hour coffee shop.  Tired of going out and wanting coffee after 10 pm only to find the only place is Dennys for coffee -ick.  Heard about Jobot -  nice local coffee house on the newly refurbished Roosevelt row.  Also serve food 24 hours.  Lots of artists and urban hipsters but a damn fine cup of coffee after 10 pm."}
{"text":"This place is very hipster! It does a great job of catering to the hipster techie or student. I wasn't crazy about it though because the food menu is minimal and somewhat caters to a particular palate. The burrito was great but the lighting was poor."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood spot for coffee dates, late night eats, or First Friday fun"}
{"text":"The new Jobot is nothing like the old. I love that they're still going but the DJ makes it impossible to have a conversation at all, so I just go there to do work now. The wifi is also spotty and drops out all the time for my electronics. I love the idea of Jobot and enjoy their coffee. Five stars if it weren't so loud."}
{"text":"Late Night Problems... there are those nights at 2 am when every thing with edible food is closed.  You pull out your mobile Yelp app.  You search for restaurants that are open now.... and just some times, you find a rare 5-Star gem and wonder,  \"How could I have not found this place before today.\"  JoBot Coffee is one of those places.

Everything about JoBot screams hipster.  It is in an ecclectic part of down town Phoenix, they serve as much local food as possible,  it sits next door to a house-pub, it is in a house itself and  the inside is retro-shic.  AND It is open 24 hours on the weekends.  I fell so deep in love with this place that I wanted to bring my cot and blanket and move in.  

The selection of crepes and specials is phenomenal.   You walk up to the counter and order something good.  This IS a coffee shop, so expect brekfast-like options with tasty salads and other things.  Sit at the counter or a table inside or stroll to a table outside on the front lawn.... enjoy food.  Repeat.  Repeat.

I can't wait for my return to this restaurant.  I am sure there are more exciting things about this place that I have yet to discover."}
{"text":"A cozy little coffee shop with some of the most mouthwatering crepes I've ever experienced. If you're in the area it is worth the stop"}
{"text":"I've been going here for about 4 years now so I feel my review actually has a fair amount of experience here. The BIGGEST turn off is the people. If you are a hipster or snob you will fit right in! Never once in all the time I have come here has any of the staff been friendly or helpful. First, You work in a customer service oriented industry so stop moaning about how hard it is living in your parents basement because they tell you to turn down your indie records and slap a smile on your face! Second, if I'm paying $5 for a coffee it better be good service and good coffee. It's not that hard to grasp. Now on to the coffee.. It is good coffee but certainly not the best phoenix has to offer . Mocha and their chai is the best on the menu imo. It's worth at least one visit  because it's a great area to walk around and is in a funky shop inside of a historic house so there's lots of character all around. The Crepes they offer are very good if you're hungry as well as some of their fresh baked pastries. All in all Jobot is a decent coffee shop but like I said the staff and \"local crowd\" that hangs there is far from enjoyable."}
{"text":"Alright, I should hardly be reviewing this place since all I had was one iced Chai Tea Latte and an Apple/Granola Crepe...but I had to say something about it.  What I have to say is finally!!!...There is finally a place on Roosevelt and/or 5th street that you can sit outside and eat at!  This place already has a pretty cool menu filled of crepes and coffee drinks which will sit perfectly with locals once they master their skills of service.  Things seem to still be a little \"new\" there but once they get it, this place won't be going anywhere. Thank you JoBot for adding an interesting little place to downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite coffee shop in the Phoenix Metroplex. 

It's a house.

They serve food. It's delicious.

Get the Toddy(Cold-brewed coffee). It's my fave."}
