{"text":"Meh. There's better BBQ in Charlotte. Wasn't super impressed by the place or the service. Not sure how any place in nc can have bland BBQ but if you're looking for the best in CLT try Midwood. Also heard that their baked beans...the famous ones..are actually from a can. Not impressed."}
{"text":"First time my husband and I have eaten here and service was great! Our server was very attentive and friendly and our food came out quick. It had good flavor with the meat being tender, but wasn't necessarily the best out there. Also, if you're not a fan of vinegar based sauces, that seems to be all they have."}
{"text":"Swing and a miss! I am a 'cue person, but this poor pork was so dry it was almost jerkey. I had to swig liquid just to get it down. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"When I heard a BBQ joint was opening in Uptown, my reaction was \"oh good, that'll be convenient - I hope it's decent.\"   On the first visit I was shocked to find it's actually excellent 'Q! The pulled pork had a really nice smokey flavor, and the sauce selection was really on par (I'm a vinegar-based fan myself). I would say that quality and taste-wise, Mac's is the most comparable. Is it better than Mac's? I'm not prepared to make that judgement yet, but it's saying a lot that I didn't walk away thinking \"Mac's is better.\"  Oh, and based on our server's recommendation and the menu's confidence (it is listed as \"Best Mac and Cheese\"), I got the Mac and Cheese. I have to say, in a city with a LOT of really good Mac and Cheeses, I was thrilled to discover this one really is outstanding.   The staff was friendly and knowledgeable (surprising given the place just opened), the atmosphere is pretty chill and fun, and the bars (plural) look prime for game watching. I was also impressed by the draft selection, with the best-of-the-best domestics and imports right along with some excellent local brews from OMB and NoDa Brewing.   If a few weeks pass and this place lives up to the promise I think it has, this review ought to get bumped up to a 5 star."}
{"text":"Disappointed - I only had their wings though.  I read one review where it said the wings were slow cooked and the meat falls off so I was hoping it would be as good as McKoy's wings on South blvd.  I live down the street so I was hoping for something closer.   I called in for take out and was recommended the jamacian jerk and chipolte apricot flavors.  I brought the order home, opened it and found the majority of the wings were burnt.  Now I'm a guy that usually likes wings a little dried out and don't mind it a little burned.  It's too bad the flavors were also very bland.  I wasn't even sure which flavor was which.  The wings don't really seem like it was slowed cooked either, just seemed like regular wings.  I probably would have been better off getting wings from Fuel Pizza.    One good thing is they gave me two large blue cheese jars with the wings.  I guess they know you would need a lot to cover the burnt taste and the lack of flavor.  They also have a lot of different beers so it might be a cool place to drink.  That also leads to me believe the reviewers that liked the wings were drunk.    Not sure if I want to even go back for anything else.  If it's southern comfort food, Merts has them beat and it's right around the corner.  I had high hopes since it's close to me...disappointing"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Wouldn't say the best BBQ I have had, but still yummy. I had ribs and my wife had brisket.  Both were tasty, but not out of this world. The sides were very good though Location is great! Nice place to eat outside too."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Sunday afternoon 8/17, for a cold beer and some BBQ on the outdoor patio. Our server greeted us promptly and the beer came soon after. We ordered the pork sliders and and the pulled pork dogs. Food arrived promptly which was nice, but unfortunately it was a big disappointment. The pork on the sliders was dry and tasted like it had been sitting around a while. The fries were limp and barely warm. The slider buns overwhelmed and further \"dried\" out the sliders. Maybe the slider bread would have been better  if it had been toasted. The pulled pork dogs were equally dry and very salty. The house chips were just plain bad. My friend convinced me to try one. I wish I hadn't. They tasted like they had been fried in old grease. Pretty bad. Our lunch seemed to be made with no love. We were very disappointed. We thought about complaining, but the foul odor from a pile of cigarette butts that the table across from us had created (on the ground under their table) was drifting our way, so we decided to just get our check and leave. (Where's the manager on duty? Is anyone running this place?)  I hope Queen City Q can get their act together but we won't be heading back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Really no stars! My family and I went here for the first time and after going to the restroom. The cook came in and left out without washing her hand. Once we confronted the manager about the cook leaving the restroom without washing her hands. The manager lied and said that she was a dishwasher instead after three coworkers there confirmed that cook was the cook! We immediately left and went to Foster's Grille instead!"}
{"text":"I was in town from out west for a conference and our group wanted BBQ. This was walking distance so we gave it a try. I asked the waiter for recommendations, and I'm glad I did. I ended up getting the 3 meat plate. Pulled pork-just average. It was good, but nothing special. Ribs-very good. Brisket- as good as I've had anywhere. It was really fantastic. The waiter suggested mac and cheese and baked beans for sides. The beans were really good and the mac and cheese was pretty good too. Our waiter was friendly, helpful, and did a great job.   While not everything knocked it out of the park, the service, ribs, and brisket took this trip to a 5. I don't want to suggest the other stuff was bad by any means, though. I couldn't justify giving great service and terrific brisket with really good ribs anything less."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews & looking at the menu for their uptown location on line, I was so excited that this restaurant opened in Matthews this week. Went there for lunch today with my 27 year old son & husband. We shared the nachos, recommended by the waitress. They were \"sloppy\" nachos - you know, the kind with a bunch of tortilla chips on the plate and very little of anything else.  I had to pick through the chips to get to the toppings in order to make a nacho. Very little meat or cheese. I think they were $12 or $14. Outrageous price for what you get.   My husband ordered the highly recommended barbecue sandwich. So bland he didn't finish it. So I got to taste it. Bland is all I can say. Son ordered chicken tacos with the highly touted mac n cheese and onion rings. All were absolutely tasteless. I can think of a dozen restaurants I'd rather eat.   The best thing this place has going for them is that it's kind of funky decor and great local beer selection. Recommend you go there for the beers and see if there's a decent appetizer."}
{"text":"We always pregame for Bobcats games at Queen City Q.  BBQ restaurants are famous for quick service and QCQ is no slouch!  This really helps with dinner before a 7pm weeknight game.  During our last visit I tried a bowl of their Brunswick stew and it was very good, but the serving size was less than I hoped for.  For $2 more I could have ordered a quarter chicken with two sides and been very satisfied.  Oh well, I will know for next time!"}
{"text":"Drove here straight from the airport during my first visit to the Queen City.  Was not disappointed.  I asked for some West Coast style IPAs, and they offered some local options that were decently hoppy.  Sat at the bar and enjoyed meeting retired jocks from Chicago and Dallas.  I opted against the sampler plate and went for a full order of the ribs.  Definitely the way to go.  I really love the vinegar-based BBQ sauces in North Carolina.  Prices are a bit upscale, but the overall atmosphere is worth it.  I can understand the complaints on service, while not the case for me, I had to advocate for some other patrons getting ignored.  Would definitely go back when in town, and think y'all are lucky to have another BBQ option in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing and the service was outstanding.  Pulled pork with different bbq sauce options, sweet potato fries, green bean casserole, Mac and cheese, local brews.  Cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Awesome barbecue!!  Also have lots of variety.  Great bar - 32 beers on tap and full bar. And ask for john.  He is an incredible waiter!  His recommendations were superb plus he is just really nice - made our night!!"}
{"text":"I have gone to this location many times since they opened. Typically get their nachos. It is big enough to be a meal. This time I ordered a burger. It was horrible. Meat had an awful taste. What was even worse was the response from manager on duty. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Slow service and ice cold bbq sweet sauce and they don't even have Michelob Ultra or Bud Light Platinum. the dinner was spoiled. We probably won't return."}
{"text":"Above average barbecue and sides but this place is not cheap. It always feels sticky in here -- they could pay more attention to cleanliness."}
{"text":"Pretty good for Charlotte BBQ. The St Louis ribs are great. The brisket is average. Great local/regional beer selection on tap. The waitstaff have a \"too cool for school\" attitude but are relatively attentive."}
{"text":"Food: AWESOME- 5 stars Service: Apathetic - 2 stars I have traveled to 50 countries and every state in the union and I ALWAYS try the barbecue, wherever I am. I travel the country every week and usually have 'cue at least once a week.  I've tried it all.  Growing up in Texas, my mom and dad took away my bottle and stuck a pork rib in my mouth!   Being my first time, I tried the Big Q platter to get a taste of a few things.   1. The pulled pork, while just a bit dry from sitting a bit too long, was excellent and plentiful. The basic Pork sauce is a nice mix of tomato and vinegar. 2. Quarter Chicken, Dark meat. Mustard sauce was just the right spice and the chicken was tender and juicy with just the right smoke. 3. Pork Ribs. THE ABSOLUTE BEST ST LOUIS RIBS I HAVE EVERY HAD. They trim them cleanly so they're just the right size and they have a nice char on them from the grill. A light cover of caramelized sauce is the perfect crust.  Baked beans are sweet and the chunks of sausage finishes them just right.  As for the service.....it was after the lunch hour 1:30 or so.  I was waited on by no less than 4 people and they ALL had the most blase attitude. Standing around. Not doing much.  Friendly enough but not interested in me just what I wanted. I had to specifically ask for drink refill. Only about 8 customers there at the time.  I wanted to ask them: \"Are you ignorant or apathetic?\" To which I expected them to reply: \"I don't know and I don't care.\"  What was so clear is that this is how they're managed. I understand wanting to be relaxed in a BBQ joint but this is a strong business with a large kitchen and lots of seats. It needs an energized crew to create a welcoming \"buzz\" in the place. They're pumping out 70 rock hits from Pink Floyd, the Stones, Led Zeppelin, etc. Let's enjoy the environment and not feel like a bunch of 20 somethings have no where better to be.  Again, the 'cue is top star food. Too bad the service doesn't match it."}
{"text":"As a visitor, I was looking for something good to eat. A fellow hotel guest suggested Queen City Barbeque. It was not good. The brisket was dry dry dry. Even with sauce. The okra was cold. The only thing that was good was the salad and homemade chips. I'm a Texas native. Good brisket need no sauce and is tender. The sauce is just extra flavor. When you have to use sauce and it's still tough and dry there's an issue with cooking and quality. I'll pass on Queen."}
{"text":"Bring on the BBQ!  I was intrigued by Queen City Q as it continued its transition from LaVecchias and whatever the steak place was called that was around for about 2.5 seconds.  Having spent four years in Texas, I'm always on the lookout for some down home cookin'.  The decor is very casual, leveraging the same footprint LaVecchia's left, but adding small country touches like wraught iron and old wood accents.  Plenty of tables, but also enough space between so we didn't feel completely on top of those next to us.  The actual menu was a bit different from their online menu, so don't get your heart set on anything too soon.  I went with a friend for lunch, and both of us were very happy with the experience.  I ordered the 1/4 plate chicken entree, and the chicken was so juicy, I wanted to cry.  Seriously, I don't know how they did it, but I've never before had chicken so moist.  Accompanying my delicious bird wasTexas toast and two sides; I chose my BBQ staples: green bean casserole and macaroni & cheese.  The green bean casserole was lovingly enveloped in a light sauce, with a final touch of cheddar and fried onion crunchy topping.  The macaroni and cheese was also top notch.  Nothing was overly greasy or heavy, and I felt very satisfied and full with my portion size.  My friend ordered the brisket sandwich (yes to the grilled onion topping) with BBQ slaw and said it was great (although he was surprised by the open face-ness of his sandwich).  Worth noting: someone across the restaurant got what appeared to be housemade chips, and I almost walked over, introduced myself, and started eating off his plate - they looked that good.  And was that a blue cheese dipping sauce with it?  If not, get on that, Queen City Q.  When I received the bill, there was a $3 surcharge for white meat with the chicken; I hadn't noticed that extra fee anywhere on the menu, so I asked about it.  Turns out they typically charge that for the 1/2 order of chicken, so our waitress took it off before running my card.  I appreciate her taking it off, but I've got to wonder why it was there anyway, since I neither had been told about the extra cost (the menu gives the option of white/dark), nor had I ordered the 1/2 plate.  Makes me wonder if it was an honest mistake or an attempt to make a few extra dollars.  That being said, my experience was delightful.  Way to go, pitmasters!"}
{"text":"The fam and I came here the other night. I was worried after some not so good reviews. Well I was pleasantly surprised! It was a very good meal. The inside has been renovated and looks great. I had the pulled pork plate with Mac n chz and collard greens. I thought it was ALL delicious! Kids had Mac n chz and a cheese quesadilla and both liked it. There are about 5 or 6 different sauces based on bbq region and I love that. I like that this place has other offerings besides bbq like burgers, salads, tacos etc. Service was a little slow but I expected it given its a new place and everyone is still getting into the groove of things. Right now, I believe this is the best restaurant in the vicinity other than one-u but I'm not a sushi person.  We badly needed a good restaurant in the area. Try them out!!!"}
{"text":"A-frame sign advertising a pork sandwich, side and drink for $8.  We order only to find out it is for dine in only, this was not advertised on the sign, nor in the restaurant.  I brought this to the attention of the guy taking our order, he asked the owner/manager and he said dine in only. He seem to avoid us.  This was our first and last time eating there.  2 BBQ sandwiches, 2 sides and 2 drinks was almost $24.00......very expensive, although you think you are getting the lunch special...."}
{"text":"Wow...way better than expected.  Tasty food, great portions, and affordable.  Solid beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Decent BBQ.  Ask for the super hot BBQ sauce since it isn't on the table.  The smoke wings are great but I found most of the sauces too sweet.  Price is on par for BBQ."}
{"text":"Not bad but not good. Brisket was terrible, not even sure the cut of beef was brisket. Pulled pork tasted like it had been shredded the day before and reheated. Sausage was very good. Ribs were OK, too much sauce though.   Mac n cheese was standard but didn't wow me. Bbq beans were OK.   Great beer selection though and our waitress was very good."}
{"text":"Second time here in a week. Everything here is fabulous. Tried the devil eggs the first time and it just got better after the appetizer. Potato salad and collards is some of the best I ever had at a restaurant. Brisket, pulled port and ribs are all great. They have whatever kind of sauce you like. Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Every time i visit Charlotte, NC I always look for a new BBQ joint to try and I actually came here a second time not knowing I had been here already. So I guess the first time really wasn't that memorable. Anyway after we were seated that's when I realized how familiar the place looked. I remember I had the brisket a few years ago and I want impressed. So this time I got the pulled pork and I'm glad I did. I also loved tasting the vinegar based Carolina style BBQ sauces. I'm from NY so the BBQ sauce in most familiar with is the kind in the bottle from the grocery store like Kraft and this was a nice change of flavor profile. The rib sauce and queen sauce were my favorites. I drenched my pulled pork with the sauce. It's quite addicting. I also tried the cup of chili which is made with brisket and comes with tortilla chips. It's topped with melted cheese, green peppers, red onions and sour cream. Now this is a great way to make mediocre brisket and make it great. The chili was full of flavor and delicious. We also ordered a dozen wings. Half apricot Chipotle and half Carolina mustard both were nice and juicy. I wouldn't have minded more sauce on the wings though. Also it's a bit expensive for a dozen wings at $12. They weren't particularly large either. Our server was very nice and attentive. The decor included a lot of wooden surfaces. Kind of like a modern saloon."}
{"text":"The food was pretty solid (pulled pork), price fair, and there was a nice selection of beer on tap.  However, the waitress was a total beast from the moment we sat down...like we were inconveniencing her by being there.  Never once a 'you're welcome' and certainly nothing close to a smile.  Someone else served our food and we didn't see her until it was time for a box.  I realize everyone has a bad day but I really don't like being made to feel like I'm the problem when I show up willing spend my money at their place of business.  Her behavior will keep me away for awhile...plenty of good BBQ places in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here with our ten month old baby. Not only did they seat us promptly, but our waiter, James, was incredibly attentive and totally unfazed by our messy kid. Dinner was delicious, service was great, atmosphere was fun and laid back. Only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is I think their side dishes are pretty average."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Ordered 3 take out dinners and no aboutt one acceptable. The half chicken was supposed to come with mustard sauce which I requested on the side, no sauce. The pulled pork was dry and also no sauce either on it or on the side. My dinner was the ribs which I ordered with sweet potato fries and hush puppies and of course they forgot the fries!! When I called to see what could be done I was told, NOTHING ..but \"MAYBE\" the next time I came in I could get a \"discount on a food item\" Really? I don't understand why I just did not get what I paid over $42 for in the first place."}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ place in all of Charlotte. I eat at the one uptown before nearly every Charlotte Hornets home game. It was awesome to see them serving at the Wells Fargo Tournament this year. When I heard they were coming to my side of town (Concord), I was elated. I recommend the Brunswick stew, BBQ tacos, and the Cuban. The fries and Mac n cheese are some of the best in town!! We LOVE \"the q,\" as my children affectionately call it!"}
{"text":"The first time we got BBQ at this Queen City Q location I thought it was pretty good. Have been there a few times, but the food quality seems to vary a lot from visit-to-visit. We generally go for the pork BBQ, but it's pretty greasy at times. When getting it in bulk to take out and saving some in the refrigerator, it's not real appealing to see the solidified grease at the bottom. I tried the brisket once, but it was really bad - seemed like it was not fresh and they put it on a grill - no smoked taste.   One time we got a pound of bulk pork to go and when we opened it at home, find some big chunks (about 2 to 3 oz) instead of being chopped. There was also a lot of fat. I don't like to complain, but I ended up posting a comment to the owner/manager on the company website, mostly so they can know about it and fix their problems. I left full contact information and expected an acknowledgement as it lets the ownership know the situation. I never received any comment back. To me this is a sign of a business where the ownership just doesn't care - maybe they are arrogant.   Now that Midwood has just opened up right across the street, they need to improve or most of the business, not just mine, is going there, since it has better food. Also there is a new Mac's Speedshop BBQ opening up soon in downtown Matthews, so more good competition."}
{"text":"Had a great BBQ meal.  Had brisket (extremely tender and delicious) Creamed corn (had nice spicy flavor / think there were jalapeños ) and fries.   Also had some of their delicious drafts.  They have 44 beers on draft.   They also have 6 different BBQ sauces  That we're all awesome! Great place and great staff"}
{"text":"Friendly service, cozy atmosphere, nice outdoor seating and if you like barbecue then yes, you might like this place. I'm not a big barbecue fan so I go for the hush puppies and sandwiches. Short walk from the light rail."}
{"text":"What a great BBQ place in the heart of uptown. My son and I checked out Queen City Q for the first time and we were glad we did. Fried Pickles-Best EVER Tuna Tacos/Chicken Tacos-AMAZING! Mac n Cheese-SOOO Good!  My son ordered the Texas Brisket Sandwhich and couldn't stop raving about it.   Our sever Kim B. was awesome. We had lots of questions about the menu and she was very helpful. Great attitude and great energy.   Park in the parking garage attached and don't forget to give your server your ticket for validation.   We will definitely be back-5 STARS!"}
{"text":"PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!  Don't get me wrong I love Queen City Q food downtown. I decided to visit the newer location in Concord that's closer to my home; I called in a order asking for extra sauces, when I realize they didn't put it in my bag, I went inside requesting it, the young lady walked away as if she was getting/waiting for the sauce for three minutes having a conversation with another employee, when she came back to talked to me she told me I had to pay extra for the sauces. I don't mine paying extra for the sauce. WHERE IS THE SAUCE! I had to wait five minutes to get my sauces, of course my fries are extremely cold now    When I arrived home to eat my ribs they were terrible. $19.00 FOR THAT MEAL!                                                                                                 FIRST AND LAST TIME!!!"}
{"text":"I've always loved Mac's on South Blvd but over the years it hasn't been like when it first opened, but Queen City Q is a welcomed surprise. The food (the sausage and pulled pork) is really tasty. I have tried the sweet potato fries and mac and cheese - both good sides. The service was fast and friendly - I went once for a work lunch and once on the weekend with my kid - both times it was wonderful. I would totally recommend this place to anyone coming into uptown who wants some yummy BBQ. Can't wait to go back!   p.s. If you love local beer, this is the place for you too!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area and this is our first BBQ in NC. Have to say we were very pleased. Great food, great service will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Had Father's Day dinner at Q. Deviled eggs and pimento cheese apps were delish as well as pulled pork.  Air conditioning was not working well. Service was good."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch and have not been dissapointed yet.  There is a great selection of beer & wiskey along with some of the better BBQ in CLT.  I would reccomend the pulled pork quesdilla for lunch."}
{"text":"The waiter we had was great! We asked him what were the best sellers and he was able to tell us what was on the menu and the ingredients of each plate. The guy who brought out our app and main courses needed to learn some manners, but overall great experience. 4 stars because thy were out of sweet potato fries and because the food runner needed to pull his pants up and be a little nicer."}
{"text":"I'm visiting Charlotte for a conference. What do they do well in North Carolina? BBQ! I ask my friends at the conference if they want to do a group dinner (last night in town). One of them says I went to Queen City Q the other night. \"It was the best brisket I've ever had.\"  There's no way I can pass this up.   So eleven of us pile in to this place. Not a terribly long wait considering the size of our party. Let me start with the bad and work my way up. The sides were mostly average, plus they didn't have mashed potatoes. The hush puppies were really good. And... It was the best brisket I've ever eaten. It's hard to describe how good it was.   If I find myself back in Charlotte, I am definitely eating here again."}
{"text":"If you are in the uptown area you can't go wrong with Queen City Q! A good way to test out a bar-b-q place is to try their pulled pork sandwich which is what I did the first time I ate there. I was amazed that a place uptown could produce tender pork with so much smoky flavor. Their sauces compliment the pork very well too. Stop by next time you're in the area and I guarantee you won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Working at the Time Warner Cable Arena, we are unable to leave and get lunch on long work days. Aside from eating the arena food (yuck) this is our only option. We ordered a large delivery order from this place ($122 order) and after placing the order they stated that there was a $25 delivery fee even if we are across the street. Once it was delivered, there were missing items and when we called back to see where our missing item was they said they wouldn't deliver it to us and we had to walk across the street and get it ourselves. Needless to say they won't be getting our services again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to disagree with most of the reviews here. My wife and I stopped by last night about 9:15. We both ordered a brisket sandwich and asked for it as lean as possible. I've had brisket at many bbq restaurants and several around Charlotte. This sandwich was the worst we ever had. It didn't have a ton of fat on it but it looked and tasted like it was sitting in grease. The bread was soaked in fat from the meat. We couldn't stop talking about how bad this sandwich was. We have been a big fan of Midwood Smokehouse and will not be straying away again. Service was very fair took forever to get the Bill. Won't be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Brisket is always give stars for me!  Not to mention the brisket nachos! They are to die for !"}
{"text":"We got into town after 8 and wasn't sure where to go. We thought we would go for some brisket. The smell from the street drew us in. We asked to sit outside. The waitress was very nice and the food was excellent! I am a very picky eater and I enjoyed every single bite.  The potato salad was yummy (even though I dislike onions). The brisket sandwich was delicious. I drank water but my husband tried the brewed beer which he enjoyed. The music was 70's Rock and the train really wasn't as annoying as the guy behind us that was smoking and the smoke coming right at me every few minutes. The people beside us brought their little dog and we thought that was nice. Very casual atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Good food. Great local beers. Cuban sandwich was excellent. House chips and eastern slaw are great choices."}
{"text":"Queen City had a great beer list and good, though not great, BBQ.  The brisket out shined the pulled pork by a far margin, and be sure to check out their beers from a rotating set of local breweries."}
{"text":"I love this place and always get great food.  I took visiting family there early Sunday during advertised brunch hours.  It was very quiet, service was fast, and the brisket and mac and cheese was amazing."}
{"text":"Delicious and very friendly staff. Pulled pork was so tender and moist, you almost don't need a sauce, but the sauces are awesome too. The corn maque choux is a must try!"}
{"text":"All I can say is check your receipt and accounts I visited as an out of town guest and was charged four times my check and when I contacted the resturant I was told I couldn't speak to a manager because it was the lunch hour rush and they would have to call me back needless to say the issue never got resolved through them and I had to go through my bank I will never visit here again and the food wasn't that great neither was the service the only good thing was they validated the parking so it was free"}
{"text":"Only had apps (slider pork sandwiches).  Service was good, pork was ok, but had better BBQ."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. The food is Pretty good for what it is. This is a good location to bring friends and family on a casual outting for breakfast, luncb, or dinner. The one thing i really disliked was their homemade Q sauces. They all just tasted like vinegar to me. However, the Q nachos are the way to go."}
{"text":"My wife, daughter, and I went for the first time 10/22/2016.    My wife ordered a pulled pork sandwich but didn't care for the sauces offered.    My daughter ordered chicken which she thought was far too spicy --- she normally likes spicy food.  I ordered the beef brisket with green bean casserole and onion rings.  The casserole was tasty but the onion rings were not cooked long enough, hence they were soggy.  Now for the brisket, my first bite told me that the kitchen staff knew nothing about preparing brisket.  It was sliced too thick and obviously came from one of the cows that came over on the Mayflower.  It was so tough that I couldn't eat it.  For me to leave something on my plate is a rarity.  I mentioned this to the waitress and suggested she let the manager know.  She did and the manager comped my meal.   On the positive, the service was great.  Even so, I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Oh so disappointed :(  After being excited to see the \"Coming Soon\" sign and eagerly waited for them to open the service given made this a less than pleasant experience. Call it bad training or working out the kinks but the wait /kitchen staff provided extremely slow service and the place was 1/2 empty. Can not imagine this same crew being able to handle a busy weekend. Food was mediocre at best. Smoked wings were charred on the outside and pink Inside. Hope they get it together."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and I without hesitation go to Queen City EVER time Im looking to eat out.  Service is top notch and the food makes Midwood around the corner seem like a rip off. I visit often and I highly suggest YOU do as well. Plus a FULL OPEN bar with great bartenders with every weekend visit Ive made. Its I promise worth the try. I dont see how you will regret it."}
{"text":"In town for one night and decided to try this because I wanted BBQ and the reviews were good. I assumed the \"Best in the city\" claim wasn't accurate, but I now have to assume it isn't even close. I walked in at at about 7pm in a Saturday night and the place was mostly empty. I should have left right then, but I stuck with it.  First the food, it was ok. I had a platter so I could try a few things. The pulled pork was fine, nothing great, but fine. The ribs were pretty good, a little tough, but no problem. The brisket was just awful, easily the worst I have ever had. It was dry and tough and I'm not entirely sure it had been smoked at all. Absolutely avoid it. The mac and cheese was good, the onion rings nothing special.  Next the beer. They had a pretty good beer selection. I had a local IPA, I-77 I believe it was called, and it was quite good. But, the beer wasn't near enough to fix the real problem.  Shortly after I ordered, a young woman got on a mic and announced that she was sorry to interrupt the football game, but she was going to sing some songs. What the hell? What kind of BBQ place has someone come in with an acoustic guitar and play a set? She might have been fine in some hole in the wall bar, but not in a BBQ restaurant. It was awful. She played at least 10 songs, and played loudly enough that you could not ignore her. I have no idea why they thought it was a good idea, but if that is a typical Saturday night, it is no wonder that the place is empty."}
{"text":"It took a few minutes for someone to wait on me but that was a good thing because there were many items on the menu that tempted me. I settled on the Caolina pulled pork BBQ sandwich with a side of Best Mac n Cheese on the recommendation of my waitress. Both were delicious. BBQ sandwich comes with slaw on it but they will put it on the side if you request it. There are 3 or 4 different bottles/styles of sauce that you can saturate your BBQ sandwich with. I chose the Queeen City specialty sauce. You also have the choice of a mustard base sauce and Eastern Carolina style. Once I got waited on the meal arrived quickly and the service was excellent. This is a good environment for familes and for groups that want to eatch college football. I want to go back and try other items so if anyone has suggestions, please share with me."}
{"text":"Excellent brisket and great BBQ. Good prices and not the deafening surround sound of a BBQ chain (not to be named ;))"}
{"text":"Spot on southern barbecue!  The pulled pork is not mushy, the collard greens are perfect and the banana pudding fantastic. Best of all is that they serve real barbecue slaw which I can not find anywhere around Charlotte."}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing!!! I had a bunch of stuff on their late night menu. The service was top notch as well. I will be back next time I'm in Charlotte!!!"}
{"text":"Seems like a lot of people have reported issues with Queen City Q's service.  Glad I did not let those negative reviews keep me from going there.  Went last night before a show at Spirit Square - service could not have been better.  Hostess and wait staff were very professional, engaging and attentive. They were turning over a lot of table last night - Checkers game so lots of Checkers fans there before the game.  Saw a couple of Christmas parties (one in a private room).  Again, no issues with service.  Food was super (buffalo wings, brunswick stew, chicken tacos, ribs, bbq - all yummy).  And they validated our parking ticket so we had free parking for the entire time we were downtown.  Plus they had live music.  Would highly recommend and will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"The absolute best bbq restaurant ever. Love the wings and ribs and it's all good enough to eat everyday"}
{"text":"Service was great and the kitchen was fast.  Check out the draft list for local brews."}
{"text":"This place was so good! I stopped in on my way from 7th street market. Just on a whim & my love for brisket. I was so not disappointed!!! Their brisket melts in your mouth & my awesome bartender Dustin made me one of the best apple martinis I've ever had at a restaurant! Thanks Queen City Q for a great lunch experience. #awesome"}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat. Food was great, prices reasonable and service fantastic."}
{"text":"The food was delicious!!! The service was quick and the food was served hot.  I would definitely recommend taking out of town guests, friends or family here because they have a wide variety of delicious food options.  The only down side to this place is that they are a little pricy, unless you order the $9 pulled pork sandwich.  *I would definitely recommend the sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"Great place w/ great food and good beers! Fun atmosphere in a city location. Cool patio for a nice day!"}
{"text":"Great barbecue and great beer...what more can you ask for?  Queen City Q certainly brings their A-game in regards to barbecuing their meats (yea...that sounded funny to me too).  I had the good fortune of coming here for the first time with about ten business associates, so I got to try many things.  The pulled pork is really the standout...it really doesn't get much better.  The sauces were decent...but I don't like to need a sauce...and luckily...I didn't.  I liked everything from the decor and ambiance, to the food and libations.  There are however, room for improvements...and that's a great thing!  If I already love your food and the atmosphere...a couple of tweaks only makes you that much better!  The service and the brisket...meh.  The service has been hit and miss on my several visits...but mostly decent.  Like other reviews have mentioned...you just get that...\"I'd so rather be doing something else\" vibe.  Guess what...acting is part of serving...and you'll get better tips.    The brisket was a bit done...and not exactly tender.  Grant it...I only tried it once...but I love brisket...and know the art-form it takes to take a tougher piece of meat to tender and succulent (yea...I heard how strange that one sounded too).  It may have been an off day...but I probably wouldn't order it after that experience.  Lastly, the beer.  Just say yes!  Sweet Josie...I have a hard time choosing any others past you.  You certainly fit in this cowboy's holster.  Giddy-up!   Try:  The Corn Maque Choux for a side  Avoid:  Domestic beer"}
{"text":"I wanna do three and a half but the servers are nice, food is delicious...drawback is the huge open ceiling makes everything like an echo chamber and it was so hard to enjoy our food when screams from kids were causing my ears to ring. But otherwise it was a great place!"}
{"text":"Alright... I will admit, I have to take some of the responsibility for my disappointment in this place. I was coming to Carolina for one night, and I wanted some real Q. The name and the reviews got me. Obviously, I was not familiar with Uptown Charlotte, or I would have known what I was walking into. The locals probably already know what this is and have calibrated for it, but for those of you coming from out of town... This NOT, I repeat ... NOT a BBQ place. It's a pre-event stadium/arena wings and beer place.... And in that department I think they probably score some pretty high points. But the name says Q. I had the brisket sandwich. It had no smoke coloring, no smoke flavor... And my guess would be that it was cooked 3 days prior to it being served to this sucker. It was surrounded by Sysco French Fries... And packed between a pretty ok roll. So that's it... Stay away if you are looking for legit Carolina Q... If you're just looking for a decent beer selection and some wings, then by all means give it a try. I give it two stars for misleading me with the name. If they were called \"Convenient Arena Wings N Beer\" I probably would have upped the rating two a 3.5. Hope this helps."}
{"text":"Would love to know but YELP put the wrong time on this page. Their hours on Sunday are only until 10PM - not 12AM!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch yesterday with a friend and was not impressed. I had the chicken, which was cold, dry and flavorless. The best thing about the meal was the one-half slice of toast that came with the entree. I absolutely do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"The hostess managed to avoid eye contact with us and the rest of the line at the door for at least 10 minutes. When we were finally seated our appetizer came out way before our drinks. We should have savored those first drinks because we wouldn't see our waitress again until we begged another server for waters 30 minutes later.  We did ask to speak to a manger. He never came by.   On the way out we went over to the manager and asked to speak with him. He said he didn't have time.   The food isn't bad. It's a shame they can't take care of their customers, we will never be back."}
{"text":"New- I'm a bad person  UPDATE: 1) the food is AWESOME, amazing. I don't even LIKE barbecue. That may have changed today. Awesome, AWESOME food. Everything is delicious. Perfectly done. Lots of happy people here. Me chief among them. Best collard greens ever, and collard greens are my favorite. Whatever that corn something something is is worth crossing oceans for. Hush puppies are perfect. Barbecue too, naturally. 2) They gave me my side of slaw.  For free. There's hope for us millennials after all. Thanks grub hub. I retract my previous impugning of thy name.   Old- I am a bad person:  All for a side of slaw. ^_^ I'll update this if the food is AWESOME. Just made a grub-hub order here. Essentially, the point of the new world of convenience for customers and all the tools we use to achieve customer satisfaction is totally lost on millennials, of which I am one, : / The grub hub part was great, yay. But oh no, someone wants a side of slaw! Let's call them and just pay for an order of slaw. I'm sure they can just throw it in the bag. ... nope. The order was around a hundred bucks. They suggested I make a whole new order on grub hub, which would of course include extra delivery charges. Okay. Except there is no way to order a side of coleslaw on grub hub. Only with a whole new minimum order, and ONLY WITH A WHOLE MEAL OR SET OF 3-4 sides. :( So I call again to see if I can just pay them. Please! Let me give you money! I beg you! They did say they would throw in the extra bun we wanted for the pork and brisket. I'm sure they are trying."}
{"text":"Place is awesome, I come here before every Hornets game and I've always enjoy myself. Jenny b, Ryan, and Stephanie has always been great to customers no matter how busy it is. Don't deprive yourself and come visit!!"}
{"text":"Uncomfortably hot inside. Slow service, looks very inefficient. Bartender taking orders then walking to another bar to make drinks. Doesn't seem properly staffed for a major event next door."}
{"text":"This place sucked. The sweet tea wasn't sweet at all and we ordered the brisket and you literally had to use a steak knife to cut it. The meat was not tender at all. Very displeased. Thankfully our waitress took it off our bill but we will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Too hot during the summer months! Literally sweating while eating. Makes it very uncomfortable to sit for longer than 15 minutes. Servers said it's as low as it'll go."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in value of combo dinner.  $18 for 3 ribs and 2 small slices of brisket, very small slides of slaw and collards, plus hushpuppies are not included (priced separately).  The food at Midwood smokehouse Is great and abundant for the price."}
{"text":"Excellent bar-b-que. Good service great location.  I had the beef brisket with Mac and cheese and hush puppies. It is a little pricey"}
{"text":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. The pulled pork falls off the bone and the homemade Mac & cheese is the bomb (showing my age here). The homemade banana pudding is delish too. I hated collard greens for years but there's is excellent. A group of my co-workers joined me for lunch there recently back and they loves it too. They've even gone back!"}
{"text":"Not really sure what people like about this place.  The ribs are very good the second visit (although burnt on the first one), but the brisket is pretty bad and inconsistent.  They give you plenty of pulled pork, which doesn't matter because it's too dry to eat. I've heard so much about their Mac and cheese, but all i got was over cooked pasta with what seemed to be cheese remnants. I may return for a beer, but that's about it."}
{"text":"I have dined here in the past and had a phenomenal server but this past time was the very last. For starters let me just say that I have worked in restaurants I know how things work. With that said, I honestly feel as though the vibe of the place is just negative. The managers seem to treat their employees like slaves almost. This young man was on the floor cleaning a spill and the owner with white hair just walked all over him completely oblivious to his employee cleaning a spill in HIS restaurant. All he did was go to the bar and talk with his \"big shot\" buddies. Im only going to mention this but there were another two incidents where I feel like the managers were being disrespectful to their employees. It's disgusting. If I saw this on my second time dining here then I am sure folks see this all the time. I dont support restaurants that treat their employees with disrespect this was my second and last time dining at the Queen City Q."}
{"text":"It was terrible. Green bean casserole was not at all like thanksgiving (she said it was) meat was dry, drinks never got refilled. We were the first people in for dinner and still waited over 5 minutes for a server to come over. $25 for cold sausage, average chicken and burnt ribs.  Waitress that chews gum is a total turn off for a server.  I got a house salad and they brought it with the meal.  The deviled eggs were spicy hot. Not sure why but cayenne pepper had to be part of that.   We will not be returning."}
{"text":"So glad to have a bar with decent food and beer in the neighborhood. I love that they carry local brews!! BBQ platter is the best!"}
{"text":"Been going for a good while and have noticed change in quality of food. The Brisket sandwich is not as good as once was and the P.O. Boy shrimp only had 5 shrimp. Manger sent more shrimp after we complained. Service was okay but was better.. The place across the street was worst."}
{"text":"Regrettably, I can't say anything about the food because we waited so long we eventually gave up. I had to wait at the bar for 20 minutes just to get a beer and there wasn't much of a line! One owner (who had to bartend) didn't even apologize to patrons as they stormed out. When the wait staff tell you \"most everyone quit that morning because of poor employee treatment\", you know you're in for quite a night! Sadly, I would advise to steer clear until they get their act together. Good luck to Q!"}
{"text":"Nice place for barbeque, not fancy. Service was lacking at first on a Wednesday night, there were 6 of us in the middle of the dining room and 3 waiters BSing near the counter.  After 15 minutes I grabbed a passing employee and he shouted over to a guy by the Kitchen - Jason, that's your table!    After that they were attentive and teamed up with different guys helping out. Beer selection was excellent, as was the barbeque. Most of us got 3 meat plates - I had brisket, ribs and pulled pork - all very good and there were 6 different sauces on the table to add if needed.   Good choice for a bunch of guys out to dinner from out of town."}
{"text":"If you can wait long enough to order, you will be very pleased with the food!  The wait is the hardest part..... sat down with a group of 6 and it was 10min before a waitress came to get our drink order.  It was then another 20min before she came back for our food order.  Finally after 50min of waiting we were served our food...... but never got a drink refill.  Only reason we stayed is the conversation took our minds off the hunger and time.  Food was good though!  I had the pulled pork plate which was good and the eastern bbq was good too (though would have preferred to seen some Lexington BBQ sauce).  Portion was a great value for the price.  I had onion rings and fries as a side.  Onion rings were good, but not the normal rings I would have expected.  These were really thick cuts, but good.  If they can figure out the service I look forward to eating here again and trying some of the other BBQ options."}
{"text":"Picture making love to Vanessa Williams when she was 26 years old.  That is what eating the food there is like.  YOU HAVE TO GO THERE AT LEAST ONCE."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Queen City Q in downtown Charlotte, a short walk from the Time Warner Cable Arena, home of the Charlotte Hornets.   Dora here. My first Hornets game ever! Too bad they lost that night. :)   This BBQ joint/sports bar serves all of our BBQ favorites, burgers, tacos and more. During our visit, most visitors were sporting their Hornets gear while filling up before the game.   We opted to try a few menu items and share: Brunswick stew, hush puppies and honey butter, and Carolina Classic Nachos.  I never pass up Brunswick stew when it's on the menu, and I am glad I did not pass on this one. This stew was outstanding, with just the right mix of meat and vegetables and a flavor that kept me going back for more. I think next time we visit I could make my whole meal on this Brunswick stew.   Dora here. Hmm. I hear you, but I'm quite sure on our next visit, you won't be able to resist the lure of the Que. :)  The Carolina Classic Nachos was loaded with three types of meat (pulled pork, smoked chicken and brisket), lettuce, tomato and chips.   I have nachos at many places, but these nachos have to rank in the top two or three. What separated these nachos from the others had to be the white queso, with just the right amount of kick and mixed well with the different meat combination. In addition, the serving portion is huge. Both of us ate on it, and still weren't able to finish.   Dora here. Huge and delish! I love chili nachos, but the chili version tends to be heavy, so I appreciated the lighter variation. The chips didn't taste overly salty while I ate them, but I could've downed a gallon of iced tea after dinner.   Service was quick and friendly, even jammed with people.   We rate this restaurant 5 forks out of 5 for a friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Bloggers"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ, great beer selection, but.... gotta get the corn bread!!! Queen City signature sauce is the Bomb!"}
{"text":"Love some Queen City Q! We were excited to see that they opened a location in concord. All of the food is good they just have a lot of new servers who aren't as familiar with the dishes. They have plenty to choose from for the entire family. I would definitely recommend you give them a try and don't let the reviews fool you."}
{"text":"Very good experience. Have been here a few times but have neglected a review. In the past, I've had catering and it's been outstanding. Tonight, the bartender, Ryan?_ rocked it out. Just a fun place, people are nice and is consistent. By the way, the food is sooo good. Thank you Q!"}
{"text":"Where to begin with this dump. They were literally 2.5 hours late for a delivery. Literally. Tough to buy back biscuits business with that kind of service. Literally never been so disappointed with BBQ in my life.   Beans had great flavor."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today and had the absolutely worst service I've ever had anywhere. Four coworkers went to lunch and they forgot to put one order in, my order wasn't right and they never corrected it even after it was pointed out. Our server would disappear and we had to ask other servers who were walking by for refills, etc. The food is OK, but nothing awesome. It wasn't busy at all, but the service was VERY slow. We waited for awhile for the server to come get our payments, then as I had paid cash he didn't give me the correct amount back. We were all on a work lunch break and needed to get back to work. This is only the second time I've eaten here and won't be coming back. The last time the service was pretty bad, but we decided to give it another chance. This time was even worse. I don't understand why someone who works for tips would do such a terrible job especially when it's not busy. Definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went to Queen City Q one night before a Hornest game. As a \"native\" Charlottean I refuse to continue to call them the B word. QCQ is pretty much the perfect place to eat before the game, they validate parking if you buy something and it's a short walk to the arena. I had the hot wings. Hot BBQ, they were amazing! Really spicy, hot and grilled perfectly. I could go for some right now. I also had sweet potato fries and a side of Okra. The sweets were also really good. The only thing I would change is the okra. I like mine fried crispy and brown. While good, these were a little on the soft side. I don't know how often they have music but there was a two-man band setting up to play. check it out!"}
{"text":"Food was great but they still have some kinks to work out in the service area.  Went for takeout and it was close to 30 minutes to get out. Only had one computer for the whole place.    But the pulled pork sandwiches were great. Collards had a good kick to them and the hush puppies were excellent."}
{"text":"Good BBQ. Great craft brew. Drink local! Eat the mothafunkin nachos. Da bomb And also some of best Mac n chz in town. If you aren't down for the BBQ, get a burger or their wings. Either way you can't go wrong. And as a rule, you must walk out with a take home order of deviled eggs! Boom!!"}
{"text":"It has a ton of atmosphere. It is true to North Carolina with its selection of vinegar based barbecue sauces. The service is good.   We split beef brisket and pulled pork. They were both good. The brisket was tender. The portions were small for what it was though. The sides were good.  If you want authentic North Carolina barbecue this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I'd give a lower star value if I could.  Liquor prices are otherworldly.  I went in recently with a friend and applauded their nice bourbon selection.  After each ordering a glass of Blanton's bourbon, having said glass poured and first sip taken, were we then informed each shot was $24.00.  A bottle of Blanton's costs between $55-$60.  And please, these restaurants only pay 10-20% extra per bottle in North Carolina, so that's no excuse.  Other bourbons on the list were north of $15 Per.  Highly unacceptable.  I've had Blanton's in downtown areas, in whiskey bars, all across the USA and have never paid nearly this cost.  Sadly, when I questioned the staff as to the justification of their garbage prices, I was informed that, \"the owner charges more for the stuff he likes so no one will drink.\"  Good business model.  Explains why we were the only 2 customers in the place on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"Fantastic food all the way around.  We got the sampler platter.   The ribs, pulled pork and chicken were all very good.   The Brunswick stew was outstanding.  We also loved the sides.  The collard greens and okra were several notches above other places in town.  We highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I've been to Queen City Q across from the Siskey YMCA a few times now and have been impressed with the food quality and beverage selection. I've only been seated at the bar thus far so can't really comment on the dining experience at the tables. But bar service has been great. Nice selection of local and regional beers on tap. Impressive selection of Whiskey/Bourbon. Even has Pappy Van Winkle which is typically tough to find in this area. BBQ is tasty and accompanied by a variety of regional sauces. The BBQ Nachos were huge and tasty. Great to split with a group. Their tacos are really good as well. I've tried the BBQ and Shrimp tacos and both were very good. The Cuban sandwich was also tasty with a BBQ twist. Could have more TV screens around for easier viewing of games, etc. I definitely see this as a great neighborhood hangout."}
{"text":"I'm from pig country, Eastern North Carolina.  While I'm now a vegetarian, back in the day when I worked across the street, my coworkers ranted and raved about this joint. So naturally, I had to check it out.  This is not real barbeque....I would never pay $15 for real barbeque either. I should have ran when I saw queso on the menu.  If you're in town on business and you're from the midwest, this place might be fantastic! But if you're used to smoking a pig in your backyard and dousing it in vinegar or going to a mom and pop shop that hasn't been updated since the '70's you won't like it.  I only had the barbeque here once and it was severely under-seasoned. The service wasn't extraordinary either.   It's mediocre, that's all I can say.  With that being said, BBQ King off Wilkinson is said to be some of the best 'que in the Queen City. And honestly, I prefer Cookout's bbq over Queen City Que's.   If you're uptown and looking for barbeque, don't. Unfortunately this is not where they serve the good stuff."}
{"text":"Service doesnt match their food.  My family is new to the charlotte, NC area.  I have had a great experience with the culture in NC.  I was excited to find a BBQ place close to home and the fact it looked upscale and not like a dive.  Unfortunately this place is not family friendly.  The hostess set up my 2 yo and one month old daughter at the table with a smile.  Two minutes later the manager got upset because this restaurant doesnt have proper car seat holders and was upset that his hostess set us up unsafely with a chair combination that we have done in restaurants a hundred times before citing insurance reasons.  He then insisted that my daughter be placed on the ground.  He said that a table was unsafe for a baby to be in his restaurant.  I was in shock and unable to enjoy my dinner with my furious wife.  I moved to a booth and put the carseat on the seat and ate in tight quarters the rest of the meal.  If you want to eat at a bar, this place is good.  There is no room for families.  Very disappointing.  We couldnt understand why a place with good food had only 4 tables full on a Saturday, but the management runs of customers.  I pity the excellent wait staff.  I will only consider takeout in the future from this location"}
{"text":"This review is of the service at the bar only.  Went in at 8 pm on Thursday 3/20 and sat at the bar.  There were a few available seats in the dining area and a table in the bar area.  We sat and watched as the bartender chatted with another employee at the other end of the bar and when he was done picked up a cell phone and talked on the phone ignoring the customers.  He then waited on a few customers at the other end of the bar still ignoring us.  When he finally decided to wait on us, I asked for a glass of water and a menu and my sister asked for the beer list.  He gave my sister the beer list and went to the other end of the bar and made a few drinks and chatted with people.  Never gave us a menu and never even looked at us again.  We thought about going over to the hostess and getting a table but I really wanted to see how long he would ignore us. (He was not busy) We watched as a group of people came in after us and sat at the table in the bar area and were waited on by another server.  They had menus and drinks.  We finally decided to leave and he probably didn't even notice.  Saw a lot of great reviews but I guess we will never know.  First and LAST time I will go there.  BTW went around the corner to a different restaurant and had great food and service."}
{"text":"Matthews location. Just opened Thursday. Nice job on the inside. Was Mario's before, and they redid the inside. Very open, but can be noisy. Very good craft beer selection.  The pulled pork was good. As good as any in the QC. The onion rings are fresh made, not frozen, and very good. Try the maque choux. Excellent. Good Mac and cheese, too. Gonna go back and try the brisket."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are visiting from San Francisco and signed up for the Soul of the South food tour where Queen City Q was the first stop. I was stuffed after the tour, but the food was so delicious we had to come back. And I wanted to try all the different Carolina beers. My boyfriend ordered the brisket with mac and cheese and the baked beans. The brisket was succulent. And I love all the sauces I can use. The Mac and cheese was dynamite and the baked beans lived up to its \"famous\" title. The bartenders were really nice too."}
{"text":"Yum!  We went on a Friday and there was quite a bit of the happy hour crowd in the bar area, while the restaurant area was pretty sparse. Now, not being a native to Charlotte the word \"BBQ\" to me hasn't meant pulled pork, it's meant any kind of meat grilled and slathered in BBQ sauce.  So for me when I think of BBQ I think of ribs.  Delicious, juicy, sweet and tangy ribs.  The St. Louis style ribs here are quite tasty (if a little more peppery than I prefer) and slathered in sauce and totally reasonably priced.  I ordered a medium plate but could have done fine with a small plate.  The mac and cheese was totally tasty, and of course the sweet potato fries that are all the rage right now were tasty too.  They have this absurd meat plate where you can get 4 kinds of meat and 2 sides, my cousin had that and was basically immobilized (in a good way). It's totally a nice, clean, casual place to have bbq and brew.  And for the fam factor: no proper changing table, but there was a little bench by the door in the ladies room where I could feed and change my baby in peace.  I love the little touches like that which make a place more family friendly."}
{"text":"I got the combination platter, and it was very good. The ribs had a great combination of flavor and leanness, the sausage was exceptionally good, and everything else was at least average. And.. it's in uptown so that's a bonus given the lack of other options around here."}
{"text":"My #1 favorite spot for Q in the Queen City! Great vibe and easy parking (they validate) so all around a great spot for drinks or family lunch."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars, I would. We visited this location for a spirit night for my daughter's school. We had never been there before and were eager to try it. We were seated and a moment later our server came by. We ordered drinks and by the time our server returned we were ready to order. We ordered our food and it came in a timely manner.   Here's where our visit took a terrible turn.  My son took two bites of his meal and did NOT like it at all. So, we called the server over, explained that my son was NOT enjoying his meal at all, and asked if we could swap it out for something else. Her response: \"No. We don't change things out if you just don't like it.\"  Wait. What?  I asked to speak to a manager. The server went to the manager but came back a moment later and told me the manager said the said the same thing: \"We don't swap out food if people just don't like it.\"  UN-BE-LIEVABLE.  So, not only would they not work to make sure we had a positive experience at their restaurant, but then the manager wouldn't even come over and discuss the situation with me herself.  Do yourselves a favor Matthews folks, go across the street to Midwood Smokeshack. The food is AMAZING and the staff truly cares that you have an excellent experience!"}
{"text":"This is a cool spot to hit if you are downtown especially if there is a sports game on tv! They have a ton of tv screens and the beer selection is pretty good! They have good daily drink specials too. Friday is $3 Charlotte drafts! The waitress we had rushed away a lot so we were never able to get a full order in before she went away. It was also a little difficult to get her attention when we needed her and that was a little annoying when ordering drinks. But we did go on a busy night so it was understandable.   The food was pretty good. The sweet potato fries were great!! The basket was a good portion for sure! We got the pulled pork dinner with 2 sides and it was enough to feed 2 people! The mac n cheese and hush puppies are wonderful! Now for the BBQ.. I personally was not amazed by it. I am not a fan of vinegar based BBQ sauce and that is the only kind they had. It was a little disappointing. I heard nothing but good things and the BBQ just fell short for me. A few people at our table got the jumbo wings (they were reg. sized wings) and the flavor was great! They are prepared with a rub and not wet and it was great! Overall the average price for just a dinner with no apps would be between $11-$15 and if you like vinegar based BBQ you will like this spot."}
{"text":"I love the Q; there really is no other words for it. I've always have a pleasurable experience with the staff being attentive and timely. The atmosphere is traditional southern with a fun, modern Uptown twist; you always feel comfortable and welcome. The management and owners are always friendly and quick to welcome patrons and guests.   So, the food, right? Amazing. I'm not from the south; I grew up on brats, steaks, and fish boils as a token staple... However, I cannot mistake good food and the Q has it. I suggest the mac and cheese (duh) and the brisket. The meat is slow smoked to perfection and is extremely tasty and tender.  So, when is the opportune time to head to the Q? Well, anytime but specifically as a precurser to your Uptown escapades, to catch some sports action, to play Thursday night trivia, to pre-game before your favorite event at Time Warner Cable Arena, or to enjoy a comfort food packed evening."}
{"text":"Better than I expected. Sauces didn't overpower the meat. Wings were huge. Liked the portion size as well. Will return"}
{"text":"All I have to say is think again before going here.  They have a very limited selection of domestic beer (we aren't into the craft thing). The food was mediocre and left us both a little underwhelmed.  There are too many other places to choose from around here to pay $50 for a meal we barely touched."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today. The meat itself was very good and cooked perfectly however i was not a huge fan of their barbeque sauces. Their side portions were a bit small and i do not recommend the green bean casserole but the hush puppies are great.   The service was delightful, everyone was attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm...such good BBQ!  I have never been disappointed with QCQ. I eat a lot of food and each plate is always over flowing with tons and tons of delicious food. Their pulled pork is great, as is their brisket. They also are one of the only BBQ restaurants that I have found that offers sweet potato fries (which I love). While the food is delicious, they only offer 3 sauces which all seem very similar to me. I do wish they had a bit more of a selection but that would never stop me from frequenting QCQ.   There is also free parking in the attached garage and their service has always been pretty great! Definitely a BBQ place to try in the Queen City!"}
{"text":"The jury is still out on this place for me, really good BBQ, good atmosphere but I've been a few places just a little better."}
{"text":"the BBQ (pulled pork) was really good, the Mac and Cheese was excellent, the red slaw was hideous.  ITs not on par with Sauceman's or Mac's."}
{"text":"Where to start?   Walk-in, not to crowded on a Tuesday night.  Beer specials and tons of craft options +1.  Country music playing. +1  HUGE BBQ portions (got the 3 meat platter).  Ribs, sausage, and pulled pork all hits. +2 -- Side note: the beans are not as good as most other  yelpers state  Not overlly expensize (Q typically isnt the cheapest meal so the prices were more than fair.  +1   This is now a must hit for me every time i come to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Food might be good but understaffed for a Saturday night. Service was poor. Took forever to take our order and for the food to arrived."}
{"text":"The fall-off-the-bone ribs and tender, succulent brisket ranks as some of the best barbecue I have ever had. Include sausage, beans and a pile of fries for good luck, and you have yourself one heck of a fabulous meal. While I gorged unashamedly on my Q Platter, the family attacked big, juicy burgers flowing with melted cheese, chili, onion rings and a boatload of other fresh fixings. And the generous portion of bread pudding we shared for dessert was killer, too.  Part sports bar, part uptown nightspot, and part family eatery, the Q features something in their atmosphere that makes everyone feel welcome. The Q is King in my book."}
{"text":"Great food. Service was solid. I love their samplers and it lets you choose the meat you are game for that day. The beer selection is good as well. I recommend it if you are by TW for an event."}
{"text":"The best BBQ in Charlotte can be found at the end of the blue line in the basement of the 7th street station parking deck."}
{"text":"The Mac & Cheese is delicious! I'd go back just for that alone. Their bbq was good at The Taste of Charlotte, but I went this week to relive that taste, and I was extremely disappointed! The Mac was still good. I had the slider trio (cheeseburger, mini hotdog, and pulled pork). The pork was super dry and flavorless. The mini hotdog was literally just a bun and hotdog....no chili, no condiments. The cheeseburger was decent, but it was dry too. Maybe it was a bad day...idk."}
{"text":"I ordered the brisket entree with baked beans and regular cole slaw. The brisket was amazing. So tender, juicy, flavorful. Glad I ordered it based off other reviews. Baked beans were very good as well, meaty. Cole slaw was decent. Clean bar, big restaurant, a lot of TVs, large beer selection. Good prices. I wish we had bbq this good in my hometown!"}
{"text":"BBQ as good as it gets in the Queen City! I would eat pulled pork and ribs every single day of my life if I could and Queen City Q is just another reason to do so.   I'm going to skip all the nonsense and get right to the food. The wings are my favorite by far and not because the pork, ribs or brisket aren't just as good but because I am obsessed with grilled wings. Their wings at \"The Q\" are slow-smoked and grilled so they have that perfect charred crispiness on the skin and the meat that just falls off the bone. My favorite sauce on the wings is their Super Hot BBQ but beware!: It's pretty spicy!  The pork is very tender and fills you up easily. The sauces served on the table for you to slather on your good pork eats are finger-lickin' good. The side dishes are a-plenty (there are about a dozen) and my favorites are the mac-n-cheese (duh) and the corn maque choux. (It's a spicy corn. If you've read my reviews you know I get down with the spice!) I personally thought the baked beans were a little too tomato-based for me and the green bean casserole was too cheesy but I've seen some people throw down on that stuff.  The ribs are also another fave of mine. I usually don't order ribs too much when I go out but I had these the first time here and continue to order them almost every time I go back. The meat is incredibly tender, the sauce is sweet and you can taste the smoked goodness in every bite.  I haven't had too much of the menu here because I find it difficult to stray from the best of what I've found so far. I did, however, try the banana pudding. Oh man, was it good! Next time, I'll be sure to try the caramel bread pudding.. I'm sure I need that like another hole in my head but why not?!  *Warning: If you come here to eat on the healthier side, you ain't doin' it. It would be more of a disgrace to come to a BBQ place like this and WANT to eat lean.   The service is very attentive and every waitress I've had has been very sweet. The decor is like uptown barn chic with rich, red walls and wooden tables and booths.  The dining room is very comfortable but it's HUGE! The Q is located where old Lavecchia's used to reside in the 7th St. Station building across from the arena. If you aren't in here during lunch when it's slammed it may seem a little slow but only because it's such a huge space to fill.   Another great bonus: They have a massive beer selection! I don't take advantage of this enough, unfortunately, because I'm always a fatty when I go here and just throw down on BBQ. The 2 bars are loaded with dozens of bottled beers (each priced around 4 or 5 bucks) and a pretty hefty draft selection as well. You would have to come here several times to try the majority of their beers!  Queen City Q is a must for lunch if you work nearby in the uptown area: Super quick service and food delivery when you're on a tight schedule. It's also great for before or after a Bobcats/Checkers game or concert at the arena. *They validate parking for free so it's actually cheaper to pop in even for one beer to get that ticket stamped! Or you can make a fun sports night of this place too. They have quite a number of TV's so you can easily enjoy apps and entrees while sipping on delicious beers and watching a game. If the weather is warm, there is also a bangin' patio right on 6th street for people-watching and sun-basking. I could definitely see myself enjoying a few brews out there with friends on a pretty day!  Bottom line, peeps: You can't go wrong here... especially if you're a BBQ nut like myself! I seriously crave their smoked goodies on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"Meal was great! The brisket was cooked perfect and was tender. Okra and the mac and cheese were delish. The waiter was very nice and helped us navigate the menu- I will def come back!"}
{"text":"We asked a longtime resident where to get the best BBQ in this part of town.  This place did not disappoint!  Great selection of brews too!  Reasonably priced.  Great server. Dine inside or outside.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Shit, do us a favor and if you say you're going to close at nine, close at nine... Got here at 8:45 and you guys are closed walked one and a half miles from my hotel room! Not nice."}
{"text":"We went here on a night in uptown. If you park in the 6th/7th street deck and then grab a drink or food here or at Brixx, they will validate your parking.   We have always been interested in this place, but for some reason always head to Brixx. This night we decided to stop in and get a drink. They had a ton of beers on tap including Birdsong and NoDa brewing.    After scanning the list of bottled beers, I saw a Woodchuck. Score! But when telling the waitress that I was going to order that she asked about the bottle...kind of like nobody ordered that. I asked her if they had any ciders on tap, and she said they had Crispin. I love cider on tap, so of course I switched. (FYI they didn't have that on their menu, so I'm glad I asked.)   We hung out for a while at the bar, which was pretty relaxed, got our parking validated and then left. Our bartender was pretty good, I think she knew why we were there (parking for Free!).   The only thing to note was that they were out of the Birdsong jalapeno infused beer. Apparently you need to get there early because they run out a lot (or so I was told)."}
{"text":"Good bbq joint. Food was above average for bbq in an urban setting. Sides were delicious (try the onion rings). Best part - selection of beers. Lots of local craft beers!"}
{"text":"GREAT BBQ WITH FRIENDLY, GOOD SERVICE! Was in Charlotte last week for a conference and being a BBQ fanatic, I always look for the local places. I came across Queen City Q on Yelp. I read the reviews and although some were unflattering, my wife and I decided to try it for ourselves.  Were we glad we didn't pay much attention to the reviews. We went there in the afternoon to see if we wanted to comeback for dinner. What we found were very friendly staff and a nicely laid out restaurant which the great smell of BBQ.  So later in the day, we went for dinner and brought a friend. We got right in at about 6:30 on Friday. They were busy, but had a few tables open. The service was very good and friendly.  Now the food. The ribs were delicious! They were smokey but also finished on the grill with a nice crispy finish. Just the way I like them. They didn't fall off the bone which is a no-no in the world of BBQ.  We also had the wings, brisket and sausage. All had a great smokey flavor and the 4 different sauces complimented the meat instead of over powering it. The sides were good as well. The meat was tender and very tasty.  I told my wife if I would have eaten there earlier in the week, I would have been back several times during the week. I'll be back in Charlotte next year and the Queen Q will be a must stop place!"}
{"text":"This past Thursday afternoon I had the lunch of a lifetime !!!!  Dunbar was extremely helpful and patient with me; he took the time to explain their menu and each of the items that I had curiosity about.   I can't think him enough for everything he did .... obtw....try the smoked egg rolls and the banana cheesecake....BOTH they are amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"After the Basketball Game was in the mood for some Barbecue. We started with an appetizer the wings, which didn't arrive until after our food came. I normally wouldn't harp on it being a game night. But the place was Empty. Smh. The wings were hot and charred. The sauces were tasty as well. Hung had the Q platter with the ribs/sausage links and for sides baked beans and  okra. I had the pull pork plate with the mac and cheese and okra. The BBQ was all well seasoned and easy to consume. The MAC and Cheese was very creamy and had a homemade taste. Okra was crisp and fresh. Overall good experience. Appetizers were reasonable $6-10 and entrees ranged $12-$20. Overall would return."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here before and it was wonderful. The pork rinds were still great, but my brisket quesadilla was full off cheese and no meat.   Our server had to be new because even though he did ask if I wanted something else, he left the plate on our ticket.   I asked him if I could speak to the manager. He walked over to her, but I don't know if she ignored him while chatting for (no exaggeration) 10 minutes to the same customers.  He came back and told me they are not able to interrupt when they are speaking to a customer. I asked if I was a customer and he looked at me defeated.   I saw her walk behind the bar, so I called the phone number on the ticket. She picked up the phone and I asked if she was the manager. She said she was, so I told her that I was in her dinning room and would like to speak to her.  She came over and made the situation right by taking it off our bill since I only ate one bite of it. I would just suggest that she keeps the chit chat with friends to a minimum and really manage the restaurant and staff."}
{"text":"This place is not very good. I personally don't like vinegar or mustard sauces, but these are especially just not good. The hush puppies are always burned when I come, and the meat is underseasoned. The food isn't bad, it's just less than average."}
{"text":"Ok.. so have been back a few times and still believe the staff is good as well as the food. Like that they have added daily drink specials. Not a lot of people eating the times I have been back even though the food is very good. Hope they stick around and gain more of a presence especially with the numerous BBQ joints being opened. This place is good and seems to have alleviated some of the issues I write about earlier."}
{"text":"Best BBQ place I've been to in Charlotte thus far. The meat on the wings was literally falling off as I ate them. Pulled pork was delicious. Seasoning was on point. Everything you could ask for in a bbq place. One qualm I have with the place is their sauces were not my favorite. Vinegar based is not my go to, but then again some might disagree. But is that really a reason to give them 4 stars as opposed to 5. I don't think so."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. I stopped in for lunch with a friend and plan on returning. I had the nachos and don't be fooled by all the lettuce you see. Underneath is a mountain of not spicy, fresh jalepenos, pulled pork and queso. There was enough here to feed a small family. I ate my lunch and could barely close the to-go box because there so much food in it. The fried okra my friend had as her side was fresh, not frozen.   They have a decent beer menu, too, with lots of options and some great local craft beer choices.   Worth the trip and worth the price."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times, I have always been happy with the food and service. The corn marq choux is AWESOME! It's hard to believe the place is not packed, unfortunate location I believe. Give them a try you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"This is a solid choice for some BBQ food, and probably the best choice in Uptown, but definitely not the best in Charlotte.   It's got a good sized patio area to enjoy the nice spring/summer/fall weather, as well as many tables inside. They have a vast beer selection, which is always welcomed by me. Their BBQ is pretty good, and competitively priced to other BBQ joints around town.    The several times I've come, I've always gotten the hand pulled pork entree. You just can't beat that deal. It's $12, and comes with 2 sides and texas toast. The pork has always been tender and cooked/smoked well. I've yet to have dried out pork here. Their Mac N Cheese is delicious, as is their green bean casserole & hush puppies.   If you're Uptown, I'd definitely recommend giving this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Unlike anything else in Charlotte!! Real BBQ, real ribs and damn good desserts!!  I got the BBQ platter .. Awesome!! Almost too much food to eat. My date got a plate of ribs... We sucked the bones dry!!!  Double chocolate fudge brownie for dessert...very good!! Great service and reasonable priced!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant needs to work some of the kinks out, and i think it will be excellent. The chicken with the SC mustard sauce was very good! My sons ordered the St Louis ribs. Some of the ribs were tender some were tough. As far as the sides were concerned the baked beans, hush puppies, and greens were very good but the Mac 'n Cheese was a little bland. My server was clueless. So close, yet so far!"}
{"text":"The Q Platter left much to be desired; pulled pork was dry with charred ends, brisket was too fatty and the ribs left little to no meat on the bone. I will say that the side of corn maque choux was tasty, but that is just not enough to justify a return visit."}
{"text":"This place makes its own sauces, which is always a good sign for a BBQ joint.  All of the sauces have a bit of a zing to them, and the Southern tendency toward vinegar-based sauces is well-represented.  Nice selection of local and craft beers both bottled and on tap (lots of IPAs, too, for you hoppy fans).  A selection of innovative cocktails is also available, including a pomegranate martini that goes nicely with the food.  The St. Louis style pork ribs are tasty and tender.  Pulled pork is very generous in portion (you'll probably take some home) and excellently spiced.  Caesar salad is fresh and comes with thinly sliced parmesan on top (like it's supposed to), although the dressing itself is a bit bland.  I highly recommend the hushpuppies, which are divine and taste great alone although they are served with honey butter.  The pork rinds are clearly those crispy ones out of a bag, but served warm with a seasoning that we spent the evening trying to identify.  Definitely a mixture of sugar and pepper, but also something else with a bit of a zip (chili powder?).  Inexpensive and low-carb snack if you're drinking beer.  The corn maque choux is outstanding.  Basically it's what happens when Cajuns get a hold of creamed corn.  A bit of onion, green pepper, tomato, bacon, and possibly a hint of jalepeno mixed into corn niblets in a cream sauce.  One of my companions had the baked beans and said they are very good, also.  The \"Texas toast\" is a little sad.  Basically just some lightly browned butter toast with nothing special about it.  Meh.  There are flat panel TVs mounted up over the bar and over the dining room, and we were able to watch one of the Women's World Cup matches while we ate.  This restaurant is also notable for being open on a Sunday night, which seems to be unusual around here.  Our waiter was extremely accommodating of our large group and split checks, and very informative about the various dishes available and the cocktail ingredients.  Prices are extremely reasonable for good BBQ, and I recommend this place for tourists and locals alike."}
{"text":"A disclaimer: if you are from Texas or the Deep South do not step foot in this restaurant. I had the worst BBQ, I've ever encountered before at this restaurant. I ordered the brisket platter with two sides (baked beans and cole slaw). When the waitress provided the food, I stared completely perplexed at the pieces of meat in front of me. Was it brisket or some mystery meat? Let me say, the \"brisket\" (mystery meat) tasted as bad as it looked. The meat was tough and was served with some sort of sweet tangy sauce on top. Unfortunately, the sides were also bad. A can of Busch's baked beans would have tasted better than the baked beans they offered. Complete waste of money, I took a few bites of everything and was finished.   On top of the poor food, the service is abysmal. I came into the restaurant during the middle of the day and no one acknowledged me as I waited to be seated. The staff were standing around talking. After being seated, it took 15 minutes for a waitress to come to my table and take my drink order. Please note, there were only 7 other patrons in the restaurant.   I don't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food - great service! Ordered wings and Pig Q platter- sausage, ribs and brisket.  Delicious!  Properly prepared, fresh and shareable portions.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm always hesitant to go to a BBQ joint being a vegetarian and all, but this place was fantastic! All the veggie options were clearly labeled and well made.   Their veggie burger was very basic and a little boring. I would stay clear of it, there are many other places in town that make it way better! However all their sides are amazing!  Great hush-puppies with honey butter, fantastic fried okra, and great mac & cheese!    If you're a vegetarian, I recommend just filling up on sides. It's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Wait staff was very friendly and service was fast.  Food was fairly good but sauce options are all centered around vinegar or mustard based.  Even the \"Lexington\" style sauce was vinegar based. I guess they may be referring to Lexington county in SC ???  Definitely not Lexington, NC style. Brisket was pricey ($16 for 3 thin strips).  Flavor was good but was a tad tough.  The BBQ nachos appetizer was good. I had a free coupon for them. Not sure I would pay $14 to get them again. Hushpuppies were good. Onion rings had a spicy batter with an aftertaste that is hard to describe. Daughter said the Mac & Cheese was good."}
{"text":"If this is what Charlotteans think is the best BBQ in Charlotte, they just don't know great BBQ. SORRY. Number one issue is cost. Their prices were way too high. 4 dollars for a small bowl of Brunswick stew? 4 dollars for six hushpuppies? 14 dollars for a BBQ platter? The sides were not a lot either. I can easily name 6 better BBQ joints that give a lot larger portions and are a lot less expensive. For our family, the BBQ was way too smoky for us and we are BBQ efficianados. We were raised on the BBQ places like King's in Kinston, NC, Wilburs in Goldsboro, NC, The Skylight Inn in Ayden, NC. The saying in most places like that is if you can still taste the smoke in your mouth ten minutes after eating it, it was too smokey. On the plus side is all the BBQ sauces were fantastic and the selection of local beers was the best around. It looks like a great place to watch football on Saturdays(they are the official home of the East Carolina Football club in Charlotte\" and Sundays(they have NFL Direct Ticket). The wings were also very good with a nice char on them and the sauces served on the side and not lathered all over the wings themselves. The BBQ is pulled as well and not chopped and as everyone knows, the best BBQ is chopped BBQ! I agree with Yelper Joy R. in that this is a place for BBQ novices. If you have really good NC BBQ, you will definitely be unimpressed. Sorry Queen City Q I had high hopes and I left lat down. P.S.- If you do want to try them, go at lunch when they do have some really great lunch specials that include the drink."}
{"text":"Made it in for an early lunch and was astounded at how packed it was. A sea of biz casual gents at every table, bar seat, high-top and even a few waiting. Not the common tale for a lunch crowd, so I was intrigued to try me some BBQ.   The space is rather large. Tons of tables in the main dining area, two separate bars with ample seating and even a private dining area with space for about 25-30.   The service was very snappy. Quick, friendly and knowledgeable. Our server seemed to be able to carry 3 pitchers at a time and still pour sweet tea into our glasses! They've definitely hired some seasoned employees.   I ordered the open faced brisket sandwich. A gratuitous portion of brisket on texas toast. Very simple, which I appreciate, and no frills to try and mask the flavor of the meat. Just some grilled onions on top for good measure. The brisket was tender and smoky. It's impressive to me that a place in Uptown is actually smoking their meats. Not an easy feat and only attempted and successfully executed by a handful of joints in town. My hat's off to QCQ for this one. Served open-faced, but easily picked up and smashed into your face for the more adventurous.   The beans were ok. Nothing special. I did appreciate the inclusion of Neese's sausage. Standard for some bacon or a few bits of pork fat in beans, but sausage? That's a high-five all around.   Great job, QCQ! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'll just say that despite having lived in NC practically my whole life, I've never been a huge fan of BBQ nor mac n' cheese until I tried QCQ's catered BBQ at church a few weeks ago. Ever since then, my world has been flipped upside down! I thought to myself, 'maybe my ravenous state at the time positively skewed my taste buds,' so I went to the actual restaurant for the first time today, and ordered the same thing, and I definitely wasn't let down! I had their hand-pulled pork with collard greens and mac n' cheese, and it was as good as BBQ gets!  The restaurant itself is a nice casual family-oriented place with TVs to keep the men busy. Seemed like a hot spot for young professionals such as myself. Definitely will be revisiting this place in the future!"}
{"text":"Queen City Q certainly knows how to cook up an animal but I think it says more that our vegetarian friend loved it too.  Sure, the pulled pork is delicious.(I like to coat it in both the PoPo and Q Pork sauces for maximum flavor.) So are the sausage and the chicken. The ribs are tasty, though they often have broken bones. The brisket...usually too fatty for me but the parts that are meat are alright.  If it's your first time out I highly suggest getting a Q platter to split with someone(s) so you can try many meats. But the sides. Oh, the sides.  GET THE BAKED BEANS!  That deserved its own paragraph. They have sausage so they aren't veggie, but they are amazing and I want to bathe in them. The green bean casserole is great and has a little kick. I'm not a huge baked mac and cheese fan but I always seem to steal some off someone else s plate. I have it on good authority that the hush puppies are also a winner. Beer is a side too, right? Because they have lots of it and the tap list is always dotted with local choices, often of the harder to find variety. All in all, the Q Is a great place to go if you have a hankerin' for a meal that will stick to your ribs and put a smile on your sauce-covered face.  Also, they validate parking in the garage next door, so fear not about uptown parking, even on Bobcats game days."}
{"text":"My 6 & 9 year old nephews would argue the reason to come to Queen City Q is because of the Mac n' Cheese. They aren't wrong, what is often an after thought at other barbecue restaurants is art here. The macaroni is never watery, the cheese is consistent thru the dish & there's just a touch of crust on top.  You may think I'm ignoring the meat of the issue. Pardon the pun. The Q slow smokes the meat that you will smell driving up 7th St parking deck (yes they validate). Rather than start a religious war amongst the regional styles The Q serves the hand pulled pork naked and provides, eastern, western, South Carolina mustard and their own house sauces. Pork isn't the only option here there's brisket, ribs, chicken & local sausages. If you're real hungry pick 3 or4 for a platter. You can bring your vegetarian friends to choose from the variety of sides. If you're in a different mood get the flying tuna tacos with Asian slaw. There's plenty of craft beer to wash down your choice.  Inside you'll find the place is rustic upscale combining local barn beams as accents to a casual seating area reflective of the uptown location."}
{"text":"So, I'm sitting at lunch in downtown Charlotte yesterday , and I hear a woman at the next table talking about Queen City Q as a catering source for her wedding. My daughter is also planning a wedding for spring of next year and I heard her mention the same restaurant as a possible source of food for the reception. The lady stated the prices were within her budget but when they informed her there was a $500 site inspection charge , she looked elsewhere. Is this true??? $500 to go Drive 15 miles and inspect the site for setup? Hell , they should hire me and all do it $50!! I don't think I want my daughter using that place."}
{"text":"My new favorite place. Got the sampler meat platter and it was fantastic.  Great staff and even better meat!!  The smoked sausage was my favorite."}
{"text":"Great menu with many options (including vegetarian options). There were many homemade BBQ sauces on the table - they were all very similar but good. The fries are delicious. The service was okay - not exceptional. Our food came reasonable quickly. Although they made a mistake with our order the corrected it very quickly."}
{"text":"We live in Highland Creek, so it's convenient close. This would be our 2nd time coming, as the first experience wasn't great, but it has been over a year since they'd opened, and we ate there...so, gave them another chance.   We were greeted by the hostess, and noticed, there were only 2 more employees. The bartender, and another employee that seemed to be assisting the bartender.  The hostess took our order, and husband ordered brisket and Pork plate, son, the same, daughter ordered a cheese burger kid's plate and I order a bleu Cobb salad, which has avocados.  When the food finally came, daughter wouldn't eat burger because it smelled like fish. Evidently, they used the same grease for something. Mine salad didn't have avocados on it. So, we just waited, and waited, and waited.   Finally, the \"hostess\", whom was aka \"server\", can to table to see if there was anything else we needed, and we told her about salad and burger, none of which we'd eaten.  The aka \"manager\" came, whom was also the \"bartender\" we'd seen making drinks, and took off only the burger.  Food is already overpriced, service sucks, kids meals, don't include drinks and I inquired about wifi password and was told by hostess that the one I see is for the manager only, and they don't have one for the patrons!  Unfortunately, we left, still hungry and frustrated.  Won't ever be returning!"}
{"text":"Great food, large portions. It's hard to get a table during any major events but if you can snag a table, it's SO worth the wait. Their BBQ is amazing and the sauces are all so good. The only problem I had was trying to decide which of their many sides I wanted with my meal. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"In an area overrun with big chain restaurants, Queen City Q is a welcome addition. The building itself suffers from a lack of windows and the restaurants which occupied the space previoisly were poorly lit and depressing. QCQ torn down some walls, painted, added lighting, etc and now the interior is much nicer all around.    The ribs and pulled pork are excellent. The wings were a little rubbery. Our waitress said you can get them well done and they grill them after smoking. I'll be sure to try that next time. Deviled eggs were also wonderful.  If you're not terribly hungry, the best deal in the place is a grilled pimento cheese sandwhich and a cup of Brunswick stew for $8.   There are 30+ beers on tap and I think all of them were local but one. I've been there on nights with pint specials for $3. NODA Coco Loco or Hop Drop & Roll for $3 is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food here. The food was very bland and pricey. The service was not good and was extremely slow. I do not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"The portions of food, quality of food, service provided by employees were all very good. Would recommend this restaurant if you happen to be in downtown Charlotte. My wife and I are definitely going back."}
{"text":"I ate here the first time while visiting Charlotte. After that first time, I probably would have rated this 4 stars. My fiance and I promised each other that we'd come back to try some of the other things on the menu. We came back a few more times since moving here. Those experiences lowered it to 3 stars. The BBQ is good. The tacos are an interesting idea, but didn't blow me away. The burgers are burgers. We'll go back some day, but until I try some of the other options in this city, I'm not going out of my way to make it here."}
{"text":"I was expecting there to be BBQ on every corner since that's what everyone said Charlotte would be like, but I guess there aren't too many in Uptown. Queen City Q is just a super short walk from Times Warner Cable Arena.  There was a Bobcats game the night that we went (3/6/13) but we must've got here before the crowd since there weren't too many people there yet. It is located right next to the Lynx railway tracks. It has a small outdoor patio but the inside is fairly large.   Stephanie was our waitress and she was very friendly. Matt also came by to fill our water as needed. He stopped and chatted with us for a bit about Charlotte and the South. I LOVE how everyone is so GENUINELY friendly and so eager to help or answer any questions as soon as we mention that we're visiting. I love California but this place is just knockin' my socks off with all the southern hospitality! :D  I ordered the hand-pulled pork which is smoked for 16 hours ($12). All entrees come with two sides and Texas toast so I chose the sonia salad (a southwestern salad made with lettuce, corn salsa, black beans, and tortilla strips that is tossed with chipotle ranch) and the sweet potato fries. They give you a ton of pork! Yum! I had lots of leftovers. Be sure to try the different sauces that are on the table. I have to admit that I only tried the Eastern NC sauce. It was the first one I picked up to try and I was in heaven. There was no need to try the others. I am a huge fan of anything vinegar based and that sauce definitely has lots of vinegar! :D It has a little kick to it too. I drowned my leftovers in it before taking it to go. The sonia salad was surprisingly good and you can't really mess up sweet potato fries so they were naturally good as well.  The bf got the St. Louis style pork ribs ($10, $15, $21) with the mac and cheese and the Eastern NC bbq slaw. The ribs were tasty, the mac and cheese was yum, and the slaw was vinegary just like the Eastern NC bbq sauce. These weren't exactly fall off the bone type ribs but they were still good.   The place wasn't that cheap considering that it's BBQ, but they give huge portions and everything we had, tasted great. We're in Uptown for the next couple months so I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Sigh, I really liked this place. My third time there. Mostly has been pleasant servers and always get the veg burger. Actually, my second coming on my lunch break and the first time was really nice. This time, however, when I walked in on my lunch break, there was no host/hostess nearby. There were a couple of servers meandering around and one who looked like the actual hostess sitting at the bar eating. I finally just seated myself at the bar for fear that if I grabbed a table, I may be ignored. I was anyway. Only having an hour for lunch, and having already spent 15 minutes walking there, I needed to order something quick and simple. Finally, someone who was either one of the kitchen staff or bartender came around and took my order. Not real friendly. He also served the food. That was the kicker. He actually came from around the bar, plopped the plate on the bar, and slid it across to where I was sitting. By the way, there were two tables in the entire place, it was after 2 in the afternoon, so being busy or overwhelmed isn't an excuse for poor service. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm only giving one star because I can't give less... The food was bland and the service was terrible. I was the only person in the dining room and it took a full 5 minutes to get my drink order and even longer for my check after I was finished. The pulled pork had no flavor, the collard greens were watered down, and it was all luke warm. To make matters worse, when my waiter finally took my order, he reeked of cigarette smoke. I was so disappointed and won't go back."}
{"text":"If BBQ is your thing, then Queen City Q is your place. Hands down the best BBQ in town and the best bar specials on week nights. And they show premier league soccer on the weekends."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy the pulled pork at Queen City Q. Each time we've visited, we received fast and friendly service. The servers are very attentive and never leave you feeling forgotten. The place is clean and has a nice city/casual vibe. You'll see everyone from families, couples, business professionals, young and old. My husband raves about their hand pulled pork sandwich and I'm a huge fan of their pulled pork quesadilla. They have a variety of sauces to switch it up a bit on return visits and their hush-puppies are SO good with what I think was honey butter. You know it's good when you eat it and you don't even know what it is (lol). Outside seating is available and I like to take advantage of that; along with their house wine by the glass. If you like your banana pudding cold, have at it. A friend and I tried it and it was good but served cold with mostly pudding. I hate that I skipped over the bread pudding but will definitely try that next time. Lastly, I love that it is across the street from First Ward park. You can get your grub on and then go walk it off. Just go! You won't regret the visit."}
{"text":"Open late, huge delicious plates at a reasonable price, right uptown?   Um yes, please sign me up. I got brisket, pulled pork, & sausage plate with mac & cheese and spicy corn.  I was so hungry, I thought that plate didn't stand a chance - boy was I wrong when it came out.  Holy cow (and pig)!  The plate was bigger than my head!  Tons of leftovers were great for lunch the next day too!"}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork plate with bar fries and baked beans. Awesome! Service was great and the price is good! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"10/7/2016: way better! Food was great as usual and the service was excellent! Victoria our waitress was great. Very nice, fast and professional! Two thumbs up!!  Ribs were excellent! Service was way better. Beer selection and full bar. They are hitting their stride! The Mathews Resturant is now coming up to the cities Resturant. Good job! I highly recommend the pork rind basket as an appetizer! Subsequent visit I lowered their score. Service was slow. Food still great though!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been wanting to try this place for a while. This location has been shut down and re opened many many times throughout the years with a new restaurant each time, and I highly doubt this place will last any longer. We got the beef brisket platter and the beef brisket tacos. The beef brisket was bland, and rubbery, the onion rings also had no flavor and we're mushy. I tried the beef brisket tacos and it was nothing like the food I tried at taste of Charlotte. And it's one small soft taco for $10. About the size of the palm of my hand. If it were any good, I'd be okay about the price but my brother didn't even eat it because it was just so tasteless and less than appealing. Everything was lacking and left something to be desired. The new BBQ place that just opened next to Publix is amazing. Their beef brisket is flavorful, it's tender, it's juicy, and I wish we chose that for tonight than these strips of rubber. Don't go here. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the Nachos, Tacos, Brisket, Burger, Wings...ok, so everything is delicious, but seriously don't leave without trying the Mac & Cheese."}
{"text":"A great place to get a cheap afterwork drink/meal. They changed the happy hour menu and made it a shell of its former self, but everything on it is still delicious."}
{"text":"Was here last week.  I'm glad I wasn't there when it was busy, it just seemed that much better.  I grabbed the combo plate with the pulled pork, St. Louis ribs, and the pork sausage.  Pork sausage was AMAZING.  Juicy and cooked perfectly, I wished that there was just one more piece on my plate.  The sauces on the table complemented the pulled pork perfectly, with each providing a different, distinct flavor.  Add the sweet potato fries that were crunchy, not soggy, and the baked beans, which had little bits of pork, and you've got bbq heaven.  Just a step below Mac's Speed Shop, but still great!"}
{"text":"I'm remembering more of this visit and forgot to mention the floor was super sticky. From the doors all the way to the back, the floors were sticky. ewww . why? we are never going back."}
{"text":"First time trying and honestly I do not think there is anything on the menu you wouldn't like as long as you like bbq! Everyone in my party was happy with their food and sides. The only thing that was kind of a bummer was the sauces they were very watery and had so much vinegar in all of them. Other than that would recommend to anyone trying to get some good bbq in uptown Charlotte!!! I will for sure be back to enjoy more of the Q"}
{"text":"I visited my cousin in Charlotte in October and he brought us here for dinner on Sat night. The place itself is pretty big and we didn't have to wait at all for a table. While we waited for our food, we were able to take advantage of their beer selection-they had beers starting at $1.75/each (I guess they do this on Saturdays, not sure what their other daily specials are). My sister and I ordered the pulled pork and it was amazing. They provide a decent variety of BBQ sauce and for the price, it's really hard to beat. Service was quick and efficient as well and I will definitely come back the next time I am in Charlotte (4 1/2 stars)."}
{"text":"I had the Carolina Nachos and they were great...could have fed two but I put a pretty good dent in them...You won't be dissapointed"}
{"text":"Ribs were tough for my liking but the service was excellent and the sides were among my favorite of any bbq spot. Try the greens!"}
{"text":"Door stated 10pm we came at 9:40 and they were closed! Bad for business... if you say you're open you need to be open! Beware of this type of customer service"}
{"text":"Parking garage for easy access. This is a serious +++  The food here is worth the drive from Fort Mill. The drinks truly have alcohol in them. What a novel concept. I've always gotten the ribs so happiness surrounds me. My husband have ordered other items and he has been disappointed & his fork manages to find its way to my plate. There is enough food for sure so no problem sharing.   This is my go to place when I have to fly out of Charlotte airport too. We consider this place a great find."}
{"text":"Let me first say, the food is on point here.  Wings are great with a good smokey flavor, and the burgers are some of the best in town.  The portion sizes are large, with prices lower than most of the restaurants in the area.  _______________update__________ I've been back several times over the past few months, and am extremely happy with the service now. There's attention on the tables and guests making the experience enjoyable again.   _______________old and now outdated________ I give it 2 stars based on the service.  I've seen several changes in management, and have talked to some of the servers about this.  The owner seems to be present more often but overall service doesn't happen by the servers.  Every time i've gone, the only person to check in on our table have been food runners/kitchen employees.  I have yet to have a server refill a drink without being asked (and on occasion more than once).  I have had issues with my bill the last 2 times, which was corrected, but why did the server not notice the incorrect prices?    I haven't been in several months now, and waiting to see some reviews of improved attention to service."}
{"text":"Not great, didn't like any of the sauces, meat was greasy and tasteless.  Mac and cheese was mushy.  After eating there it sent me and my husband running to the bathroom....only positive according to hubby was the variety of beers on tap."}
{"text":"I held a Purdue University alumni event at Queen City Q. The staff was easy to work with to plan the event and our server the evening of the event was OUTSTANDING. The buffet was very tasty except our chicken was a bit on the dry side. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Went to Queen City Q after going to Imaginon with the kids for lunch. I ordered the brisket my wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich. I also got the wings with their hot sauce. The wings were not to my liking. They are suppose to be smoked ad then grilled but they were very slimy feeling with zero crispiness. The sauce was not what I was expecting being a sweet vinegar sauce with some spice to it. It probably would of been good on some pork but didn't do it for me on the wings. The blue cheese was good but did not compliment the sauce at all. Then the brisket came out large strips that looked like they were grilled which I didn't really get. They were pretty tough as I could not get through it with a knife it just shredded the meat. I have had good brisket and this is some of the worse I have had. No crust couldn't really see a smoke ring very tough not a lot of flavor. The mac n cheese was ok and the hush puppies were ok. The hush puppies are an actual side you have to order and not just part of the meal like every other BBQ place I have ever been to. I would of given 2 stars but my wife game me some of her pork and it was pretty good. SO if you have to go just get the pork and skip the wings."}
{"text":"All I can say is Wow!! Great new BBQ place near my home in Matthews. Just across from the Siskey YMCA. I was greeted by 2 smiling faces at the door. Then my waitress... I think her name was Caroline, was helpful in helping me navigate the new menu. I had the Big Q so many could try everything... I loved the Brisket and the pulled pork the best but the short ribs and chicken were a close 2nd... The onion rings and pickles were good too. Look forward to bringing my friends back to the Q..."}
{"text":"So i recieved a text that my old roomate was working there.  She told me I had to stop in.  We were seated rather quickly and the waitress even turned the knicks game on for us.  As my friend and I must try to the wings everywhere, we didn't stop here. We did 6 Po Po wings and 6 jamiacan jerk.  Can I say the Po Po wings are the best wings I have ever eaten in Charlotte?  Well screw you I just did boom!  The jamiacan weren't that bad either as they didnt have that over chivey taste.  Unfortunately we both ordered the brisket ( i would have liked to see another entree), but it worked out in a way.  The sweet potato fries were amazing and the brisket was cooked very well.  We marveled at how well the brisket was.  The only problem I had was the suace was a little too tangy, but my friend thought it was great.  To each their own I guess.  The price wasn't too bad and this will def be a place i repeat.  The only problem I had was parking as there was no parking on any roads that day."}
{"text":"Was definitely very pricey for what you get. I ordered a combo with ribs, chicken, and brisket with side of mac n cheese and collard greens. However my brisket was pretty dry which i wasnt happy about. I had to drench it with the different bbq sauces they had.   The chicken was good and moist. That was well cooked. And what is a bbq place if i dont get ribs. The ribs were good but it wasnt like i never ate ribs like this before.   The atmosphere was nice they had a lot of TVs there.  The one thing i would suggests is that to get the sweet tea! Now that was really great!  I just wish my brisket was better because thats one of my favorite types of bbq.   this place was referred by a person who worked at the charlette bobcats arena, so I figure i give it a shot."}
{"text":"Generous portions and super tasty. I love the pulled pork sandwich and sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"Great food. Barbeque sandwich was 'THE BOMB.COM'. I highly recommend collard greens off the chain and hushpuppies absolutely wonderful.  The food had me humming as I was eating.  The wait staff wonderful and informative.  Prices reasonable. I will go again."}
{"text":"Went there to pick up my bday dinner and was met with great service and polite convo. The food is yummy. I especially loved the mac & cheese and smoked sausage. I'm glad that they are in Ballentyne now, will return. Finally good smoked BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"In Charlotte for the week for work.  Asked the front desk where to go for a local taste of down town.  They sent me to Queen City Q and I couldn't be happier.  Andrew the waiter was great.  Suggested some amazing local beer to go with lunch.  Will definitely be coming back over the course of the week."}
{"text":"I'm quite surprised that more good BBQ doesn't exist in Charlotte! I would have thought, Southern city = Great BBQ. Well, not the case here in Charlotte, until now that is.  Queen City Q is really a great BBQ joint. I had their Brisket for lunch, and let me tell you that it was AWESOME! Super tender, melt in your mouth, and very flavorful!!! Had Mac and Cheese on the side and viola! there was some great BBQ!  Come to find out that it was THESE owners that started Mac's BBQ. BUT, they left to start their own BBQ joint because the owners of Mac's just didn't adhere to the vision. We've been to Mac's, and felt that their BBQ just didn't cut it. And in comparing the 2 briskets, it was UNFAIR, because Queen City Q's knocked out Mac's with one punch!  Thankfully, Queen City Q is walking distance from my Uptown office. Hopefully, others will discover this great BBQ joint. It is off the beaten path, but WELL worth it. Go check it out for yourself. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good & they Love what they do here too!!! I had a 3 Q plate with Brisket, Ribs, & Pulled Pork. Fried okra &!hush puppies & banana pudding. Callie was my server & she was very attentive without being smothering & I love that type of service!!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly they offer great veggie/seafood options for those who do not eat land animals. I highly recommend the shrimp and tuna tacos. Flavorful and filling. I usually order their green bean casserole as the side and that alone can fill you up since it's baked with a ton of cheese. Their mac & cheese is pretty decent too. Don't skip dessert. Banana bread pudding is a must. Service is prompt and it hasn't been too full or packed when I've gone."}
{"text":"Finally a Barbeque place in Charlotte that doesn't just focus on barbecue being a noun.  This place has all kinds of barbequed meats, even excluding their acclaimed Carolina style barbeque, (which is a noun).  This was my second time eating here, but the first time I only had a chicken sandwich and mac and cheese (both of which were fresh and delicious).  This time we shared a Queen City sampler which included some killer St. Louis style ribs, a decent piece of barbecued chicken, a good sausage, and some tender brisket.  I also had the mac and cheese again along with some green bean casserole. Our service was mostly good but got a little slower the longer we were there as the place got crowded for a Charlotte Checkers event.  It is a great pre-game spot with plenty of local beers on tap, all of which are $3 on Fridays.  All in all, Queen City Q is a pretty good barbecue place uptown, and it is nice to see a restaurant finally doing well in this location."}
{"text":"Every sauce they have in the cradle including mustard and lexington has sugar in it and too much.  The mustard tastes like honey mustard and lexington barely has the flavor of vinegar coming through.   Did not try the meats just the pork rinds with the different sauces.  I had them sprinkle the rub on the rinds.   The rub is very good.   Atmosphere is fantastic.  Service is good.   Back to socializing."}
{"text":"Went to my first happy hour. I've been looking forward to tasting the food here for some time now. The service at the bar started a little slow but you could the resturant got slammed all at once. Once the staff adjusted to the rush things moved much smoother. I ordered the wings, ribs, and wings. The ribs were cooked exactly the way I like them, moist but not gross with a weird texture. The apricot Bbq sauce was out of this world. The wings were jerk seasoned and ok at best. They seemed overly fatty for my taste but still very flavorful. The star of the happy hour for me was the pulled pork sliders. Put a little popo sauce on them and you won't be able to stop eating them until their finished. It's not your typical NC Bbq joint and that's ok can't wait for my next trip."}
{"text":"I went to Charlotte for the weekend, and went here for lunch with some friends of mine yesterday. I really enjoyed the food here! Queen City Q is located right across from the Time Warner Arena stadium; it has an inside and outside area to eat at. We chose to eat outside since it was a beautiful day, plus you can get a good view of downtown Charlotte!  Our waitress was really nice and prompt. Service was on point for sure! I got the Q's platter which was three meats, two sides, and Texas toast. I got pulled pork barbecue, brisket, and ribs for my meats; fried okra and Mac and cheese for my sides and of course toast to go with it. Everything was delicious! The meats were cooked perfectly and the sauce there was to die for! It was very sweet and tangy. Their Mac and cheese was also some of the best I have had in awhile. Cut made me think of the max and cheese these old ladies used to make at my church when we had a pot luck or something!   All in all the experience here was great, and the next time I come to Charlotte I will make sure to be back!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent as always today!  But.... I was looking for some relief from the 90 degree heat and I did not find it here! Please, fix your air conditioning! Wow, sweating inside while eating hot food was not the best dining experience."}
{"text":"I would give the Q a solid 3 of 5 stars. I had the wings and mac and cheese and a side of deviled eggs. The wings themselves were pretty good but the jerk sauce is definitely some crappy store bought concoction. The wings were a better than average size. The mac and cheese well lets just say its not. A greesy oily clump of noodles with burnt fried cheese on top. Yeah its that bad. The deviled eggs are definitely not your grandma's eggs but hey at least the plate presentation was on point."}
{"text":"We went on 1/2 price wine Wednesday and enjoyed it while we waited for a table. There were plenty of TVs to watch all the sports. Ordered the half chicken and enjoyed it. The mac & cheese was pretty special too. Overall, I enjoyed it and will return! Pro tip: They validate parking in the 7th street garage."}
{"text":"Checked out this place for Sunday brunch after reading the reviews.  While I have to admit that I had better pulled pork and not a fan of the vinegar-based sauces, I did enjoy the food here.  The mac and cheese and cole slaw were good.  I also appreciated that they had six different sauces to try and had a South Carolina mustard sauce and also like the Lexington Dip and Queen City Signature.  This is a good place to hang out and would go back."}
{"text":"It's cold & wet! So why not feed myself some comfort food at the Q!!! 1/4 dark smoked chicken, corn casserole, southwest salad, and an OMB Bauern Bock"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time tonight and it was absolutely the most amazing food I've had uptown. RIBS FALLING OFF OF THE BONE!  The chicken was amazing and the service I received was FANTASTIC.  With out question request Gina as your server.  I can honestly say that I haven't received that kind of service at 5 star restaurants. Drop what you're doing and go NOW!"}
{"text":"I tried Queen City Q for a second time today.  My visits were about 3 months apart.  Both times I had a BBQ sandwich with a side of mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was great.  The BBQ was dry and had no flavor.  It was this way on  both of my visits.  I tried to add sauce to it but it didn't help.  None of their sauces were to my liking.  I have tried all of the BBQ places in the Charlotte area and I would consider this one last on my list.  Don't plan on trying it again."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying I am from Texas so I may be bias.  The place is clean, my sever was friendly, and the beer was local and cold. But the star of the show, the food, was ok.  Don't get me wrong, the sides of Mac-n-cheese, green bean casserole and hush puppies were very good.  However, the pulled pork and brisket were OK.  To me the place seemed commercialized.  I want to step in and see the pit and smell the smoke.  I want the option to purchase by the pound and when I order brisket I want to be asked lean or moist.  The brisket was tough and it appeared to be smoked and then put it on the grill, odd.  By no means overlook this restaurant and try it for yourselves because in the end it's BBQ."}
{"text":"Came again on a Friday night. Thankfully we beat the rush before the Hornets game let out. Our server was Courtney, she was very nice and moves fast. She also resembles Alicia Keys. She would come back and check on us regularly. Had the brisket cheesesteak. Very tasty. And a huge plus is that the parking is connected to the building where you don't even have to go outside and they validate it after your meal. Certainly will come back."}
{"text":"Love this place and hate the left Bally but I took advantage of working uptown today and stoped by for some ribs and Mac and cheese. Great service and always friendly peeps at the bar.   #BestSuacesNtown"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Been here about 5 times, tried a few different things  ok here goes the shrimp tacos and brisket tacos - deelish! The hushpuppies - best I've ever had. The burgers - omg the burgers! So juicy and tender. The onion rings - amazing and perfectly seasoned! The brisket would be my favorite, but also can be hit or miss. The ribs are great and the pulled pork - best thing on the menu and that's saying A LOT! They also have great drinks specials each night!"}
{"text":"Look, opinions run strong in this area around BBQ.  I get that.  You may have another and that's okay.  But, for me, I'm thrilled that Queen City Q is open in downtown Charlotte!  Perhaps you can find better BBQ if you want to drive to Lexington or somewhere else in remote areas.  But, I guarantee the difference isn't worth the fuel it takes to start your car or the grain it takes to feed your horse!  This place serves good pork BBQ and several other great meat/entree options too!!  The ribs, brisket, chicken, and even the smoked sausage are all really good!  That's one reason that I love to come here with a group, and just buy platters to share!  I like it all!! Check out that Super Q Platter, get a beer, relax and \"pig\" out!!!  Speaking of beer, take a look at the beer menu!!  Wow!  Lots of craft beers to choose from and maybe try a new one!!  There are 40+ drafts and then lots of bottled beers too!  For me, I'm happy to enjoy my favorite - OMB Copper!  I've eaten a lot of food here, and can tell you that you won't go wrong whatever you order.  It may not be how YOU would make it, but then, you aren't eating at home, are you?  From the appetizer list - the Deviled Eggs w bacon (mmmm), their own Pimento Cheese (another mmmm)!  The hushpuppies  served w/ honey butter are really good, and then one of my favorites - the fried pickles!    There are several great sides to choose from including mac-n-cheese, collard greens, and baked beans w/ Neese's (a Greensboro, NC company) sausage - these are all winners for me!  They have two different kinds of slaw - Low Country and Eastern NC BBQ slaw.  I'll bet the Low Country is good, but I can't get by the Eastern style! And I'll stop there with the sides, cause there's quite a list.  The restaurant has lots of room and the wait staff has always been very attentive!  If you need to hold a secret meeting, or maybe just a private function, they have a room you can reserve.  You can tell, I really like this place!  And to think that it's in downtown Charlotte!!  It is adjacent to a parking garage. And, it's right on the light rail line, so if you uh, don't want to drive home... or if you'd rather ride the rails... you can!  And there is a Charlotte B-Cycle dock right outside the door.  Lots of ways to get here!  So, just get here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to have some food here last Saturday, never been before. The brisket was tough, greens are spicy with no warning, and the mac n cheese was average. Large portions. Service was bad. We walked in with no welcoming and we were not sure if the two standing at the front were busy or just didn't see us. We had to get their attention and we were the only ones waiting. Our waiter was rushed and rude and there were very few people in the restaurant. He kept asking if we needed anything and then would tell us it was going to be a while before he could get it. What the heck?! He seemed stressed and made it very uncomfortable. We won't go back, not worth it."}
{"text":"The food at \"The Q\" is great. Prices are a little on the high side but you get a lot of food.    You wont look live a savage trying to eat the ribs, the meat falls right off the bone.  The Brisket is phenomenal and the pulled pork is really great. If you like hush puppies their are like crack.    Service.  It is hit and miss and I have had more misses than hits.    All and All if you have a hankering for some Que check this place out."}
{"text":"Ate here today and was pretty disappointed. Our server Colby was great and the tea was good, but everything else left a lot to be desired. We started with fried pickles and deviled eggs. The eggs were good, but not really $1 each good. The pickles were breaded very well, but were a bit too salty for our tastes. We ordered the pick 4 Q platter so that we could get a taste of several different kinds of bbq. Brisket, pulled pork, chicken and sausages with a side of Eastern Slaw and Best Mac and Cheese. None of the meat had any hint of a smoke ring and tasted like some sort of smoke flavoring had been added. Everything had grill marks that hinted at being warmed up from a package. The brisket was eerily reminiscent of a McRib in texture, size and shape. The chicken quarter that came on the plate was pretty dry. The pulled pork lacked anything that I could get excited about. The sausage had good flavor, but again it wasn't from smoke. The sauces that were offered at the table all tasted pretty similar with the only differences being how much vinegar or sugar were added to the sauce. The mac and cheese was alright, but definitely doesn't warrant the heading of \"best\" and the slaw was pretty much non-descript.   We have seen several places come and go through that location, and I was so hoping that this one would be a change for the better. Unfortunately, even the decor is the same as the last several places that have occupied the space. The $50 that I paid for lunch was way more than what the quality and ambience deserved. Maybe the next restaurant that calls this space home will be an improvement over the last several that have been here."}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant one night for dinner and everything was good.  The next day we went in for dessert and the same waitress (I think her name was Angie) that served us the previous night was extremely rude and unprofessional....yelling at other waitresses and hostess, ignoring us and other patrons, telling us it was \"not her job\".  The food was good however not that good to ever enter that place again."}
{"text":"I met up here with a couple of friends of mine for lunch.  The decor was very suitable for the locale.  While we were here, we got to sample some brisket prepped a couple of different ways.  Both were excellent and offered very distinct flavor profiles!  I ordered the pork plate with mac & cheese and BBQ slaw.  The slaw was very fresh and tangy.  The mac and cheese was absolutely creamy and delightful.  And the pork...  it was most excellent!  Wish I would've gotten a little bit more bark on my plate, but that's not a huge deal.    We got to talk with the owner and the pitmaster.  Everyone was very helpful and polite.  I hope they continue the good work as they ramp up for prime time!

{"text":"First off great location. Next to 7th St Market and Time Warner Arena. The smell from them always gets me when I'm parking in the garage. If you not hungry you will by the time you get to the ground floor.   Queen City Q is really nice spot to chill before the game or any event and after. Tons of beers on draft. Nice bar selections and great mixed drinks.   Now the food. I love their pull pork sandwich. I'm just a pulled pork fan but not every one does it right but they do. I love their ribs and you have a selection of sauces at you table to choose from. The staff is great and friendly. If you in uptown you stop by."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for a short business trip and went to this place as it was close to my hotel.  It was a busy night as there was a game at the nearby Spectrum Center.  However, the service was good despite the crowd, and the ribs were very good.  I liked it so much I went back the next night and had another great meal.  Thank you Yelp for letting me know about this place."}
{"text":"So sad; just went to eat lunch at my favorite Barbecue restaurant, Queen City Q and they've closed the Matthews location. I hate this!!  I'll miss their food, the friendly staff and how close it was to where we live."}
{"text":"Meh. Not one of the best BBQ places in CLT, a place known for bad BBQ. At least it's not expensive. They do have good beers on tap and the in-restaurant experience is good, keeping this review above 2 stars. The hush puppies and honey butter are the best food items I've had there. Ribs are not great. Go to Sauceman's for BBQ in CLT. If you're down by Ballantyne, you've got Midwood Smokehouse. Just don't see how this place survives."}
{"text":"This is the BEST BBQ Place in Charlotte HANDS DOWN!!! We decided to use them for catering our work event. I went and ate there the day before just to check it out, the ribs were OUTSTANDING. The Collard greens and Macaroni and Cheese made me want to get up and dance. I am now worried because it is in walking distance AND prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Just opened for business today. Food was good, wish they had a hotter sauce. Was a little pricier than I  expected for the area and quality. Not very busy but I don't think anyone knows they're open yet. Same location as the old Elwoods BBQ. Will come back and try it again to see if they can improve and justify the prices. Had a lunch special, pulled pork platter w/2 sides & half a slice of Texas toast for $11, normally $12."}
{"text":"A group of 3 of us went for lunch on a weekday afternoon. We each got the pulled pork sandwich, and each of us got a different side. We were all very pleased with our selections.  The pulled pork was a generous portion and offered with slaw on it or on the side. There are a number of different sauces on the table so you can flavor your sandwich how you like it. For sides we had:  Bbq cole slaw - good, served chilled with a nice bbq zing Sweet potato fries - crispy and hot Baked beans with sausage - nicely flavored beans  Our server was Lela and she was efficient, cheery, and delightful!"}
{"text":"I don't know if I'm just really picky or all the restaurants I've been to just sucks.   My bf and I stopped by here on a Sunday for my first time. I LOVEEEE BBQ! And what's better than BBQ? BBQ ribs, apparently not at QCB. I ordered a rib entree that came out not even hot. I was craving for some good ribs, but my ribs were hard and super disappointing. They felt like left over ribs from the day before. I tapped it with my fork and it was hard. You could literally throw that at someone and kill them. I had to use my knife to get the meat off of the bones. The meat was far tender and good. Even Applebee's and Chili's ribs are better. At least their ribs' meat fall off the bone without me having to use my knife. TERRIBLE!  The potato salad was also a disappointment. I'd rather go buy potato salad at Walmart, but that wasn't the issue. The cole slaw was so tasteless, and I didn't like it at all, so I had asked the waitress to change my side. She told me she wasn't allow to and had to ask her manager first. She disappeared for a while and came back and said the manager allowed her to, so I asked for the onion rings this time. There was this worker standing beside our table the whole time that I was complaining, as if he had nothing to do; obviously he was listening to us. He handed me my onion rings and I have to say, they were alright.  So, the manager took her to the back and even if I didn't hear him, anyone could've tell he was yelling at her. I guessed he didn't allowed her to change my side, but she did it herself. He stood at the corner looking at us for the rest of the time. Seriously? If he had something to say, he needs to say it to me, not stare at me.  So our ticket came out and we were charged for the onion rings. REALLY?   I don't even want to write about this place anymore."}
{"text":"In Charlotte, we love our bbq.  This place can stand up to the top spots in and around the city as far as the pork goes! It offers one unique aspect in that it is located in the middle of uptown rather than out in the 'burbs like most of them.  Country cooking, urban setting.   We came in on Sunday for lunch and found the place to be pretty empty, which was a little surprising since we got there just after 12.  There were some good drink specials going on including $5 bloody marys and some $2 local craft beers.  There was a brunch menu but nothing on that menu looked all that interesting so we opted for the classic pulled pork.  The menu had all kinds of good looking sides to go along with it.  I'm talking collard greens, onion rings, sweet potato fries, bbq slaw, hush puppies, baked beans, etc etc etc...   There were several different varieties of sauce on the table to suit different tastes.  The Eastern style is always my favorite and theirs was pretty tasty.  Once it was all said and done, we had the really good down-home meal that we were hoping to get when we walked in.  We will definitely be back to this place and I highly recommend it if you're in town looking for good barbecue."}
{"text":"Great service. Q platter was awesome. Mac n cheese and collard greens were delicious! Good sauce options. Good portions of food. Definitely liked that I could create my own combination with the platter. Got double ribs and sausage. First time having St. Louis style ribs - tender and fell right of the bone. Free parking with ticket validation. I would recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"Love this place! This is my 2nd time here and the wings and pulled pork are still delicious. They have great beers selection and the atmosphere is awesome. Service starts off slow but then it picks up and the staff is great. Every time we go to Charlotte, we make sure to make a pit stop here."}
{"text":"Excellent local draft beer selection & consistently good food. Anything with brisket is my favorite."}
{"text":"The awesome beer list was amazing and they had some rare stuff, local dunkel. The pulled pork, brisket, ribs, collared greens, beans with sausage was all very good. Now the brisket was terrible. I mean terrible. Anyone from Texas do not go here you will cry. It was tough, it was under cooked, and they made it worse my grilling it. Get a proper smoker and do the brisket right. The brisket lost you two stars."}
{"text":"While I was in town for the Democratic National Convention, I made it a point to eat as much BBQ as I could.  Queen City Q was easily my go-to place within walking distance of my hotel to grab an authentic bite of Carolina BBQ.  Each visit, I ordred the barbecue pork sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries and a sweet tea.  The texture of the pork was tender and the flavor tasty, but what really made the sandwich was the homemade savory and sweet sauce.  If they sold it in a bottle, I would have purchased a few bottles to take home with me.  Their prices are also quite reasonable.  The next time I have a serious hankerin' for some BBQ, I'm heading to Queen City Q in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Ok, I have been here for lunch during the work week and the service is never great. This time it's Sunday Brunch and 15 minutes for some one to take our order, another 5 minutes for someone to come by and tell me they are out of Grits, then 30 more minutes for them to bring one order, after 20 more minutes we gave up all hope on the rest if the order!!  The BBQ is good but it's not worth the aggravation."}
{"text":"The BBQ here is incredible. I got their large platter and all of the meats were delicious. They also have a large selection of beer on tap."}
{"text":"Finger Lickin good eating....  Worthy of several repeat visits. Sweet potato fries are great sides..."}
{"text":"Queen City Q takes the place of what was dubbed \"Our Little Spot,\" Elwood's.  So I was really curious to see how well this place stacked up.  Honestly, I've only been there once, so this is going off of one dinner.  The BBQ in Austin Texas pretty much ruined all BBQ for me back home in Charlotte unless I smoked it myself.  I've since had brisket too tough and brisket that crumbles...  But this place was definitely ahead of the curve.  I ordered the brisket, it's my spirit animal.  Being this is a Central Texas delicacy in the Carolinas, I knew it's probably not what they're known for,  but it was cooked pretty much perfect.  It's advertised as Texas style, but it's not.  This brisket is slathered in sauce as opposed to having it on the side (or none at all.)  But, the sauce was really delicious to be honest and it didn't take anything away from the meat.  I also noticed grill marks on each slice, kind of nice touch for appearance.  Surprising to myself, I really enjoyed this style of brisket!  The sides were amazing too!  Get the Mac and Cheese!  Looking through the menu, there seems to be plenty to choose from!  Wish they did burnt ends, but they have hush puppies with cinnamon butter like Elwood's had!  Can't wait to make a return trip, I think I may have found my new \"Our Little Spot!\""}
{"text":"The food and drinks are a little overpriced. The sides were better than the entrees. The Mac and cheese and onion rings were very good. The chicken that we got looked undercooked and had blood. Apparently, smoking the meat can cause that but we couldn't finish it the way it was cooked and they wouldn't cook it more for us to get rid of the pink meat."}
{"text":"Hit the Queen City Q with 2 of my band mates this week. A few months ago, I would have been in Q heaven. I've been on a vegetarian diet for a while now.  1 friend had the pulled pork plate and the other had the Buffalo chicken fingers. They both loved it. As for me I had the fried pickles and the pimento cheese spread with pita chips. I was not disappointed!! Great beer selection and atmosphere, PLUS, it's right across the street from our band rehearsal space. I will return!"}
{"text":"The customer service at the Matthews place was very poor.  Waiting for food for over 40 mins for take out & they don't communicate to each other. They mess the order up & then shrug their shoulders.  The manager only say well we backed up.  Really???? this is not how u communicate with paying customers.  It is evident that nobody knew what they were doing.  Sad b/c bad customer service result in bad business."}
{"text":"My best friend took me here on my visit to her home in NC. It was right on time. The food was delicious, the server was amazingly nice, and the atmosphere was great!   The brisket was so delicious, It had so much flavor. I want some right now actually!"}
{"text":"I had the side plate and the macaroni and cheese was delicious. The vibe was great and the bartenders were really helpful. It's not the best bar-b-que  in Charlotte but it was definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were downtown on our way to a hornets game. We wanted to grab dinner somewhere before the game and stumbled upon Queen City Q.   Walked in and the decor was great, I loved the layout. You get to look right into the kitchen and the out-window is pretty much table-side.   Grabbed the dinner menu and a drink menu and was pleasantly surprised to see a pretty large selection of beers and specifically craft beers. My eye immediately caught the beer \"hop drop'n roll\". I thought the name was clever and thought I would try it. It didn't disappoint.  Then I looked at the dinner menu and asked the waiter what he recommended and he pointed me to the Q-Ban Sandwich, I chose the Mac and cheese as my side. The restaurants spin on the Cuban sandwich. Had pulled pork, beef brisket, 3 large juicy pickles, and a top layer of ham it was a perfect mix . The food came out quick. The pickle, and the added SC BBQ added made a perfect sweet sour tangy taste and I fully recommend you try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Great food! I've had many different menu items and they have all been excellent. The nachos are amazing as well as the pimento cheese appetizer. You can't go wrong with anything you order here."}
{"text":"I was visiting Charlotte for 6 days and this was Number 4. It sounded good, but save your calories and your money.  The food was the worst I have had on my whole trip. I sent the sausage back because it was cold. When I got it back it looked like it had been run over by a dump truck. I had to cover it up with a napkin because it looked so awful and was burned. I sent it back. The next one was even worse. Burnt to a crisp and dripping with grease. The waitress said \"we smoke our meats\". Cigarette smoke no doubt. The pulled pork was in a pool of tasteless grease and it had NO FLAVOR. The toast had no butter on it. The BBQ sauces spilled a teaspoon of water on my plate before the sauce came out. It was not worth the trouble. Don't expect any help from Manager Ryan. He was not helpful and made a smartass remark to me as he walked away after my complaints. \"Enjoy your dining experience\".  DO NOT GO HERE. It cost over $21 and there was less than $5.99 worth of food. They will rip you off."}
{"text":"Queen's City Bar BQ was the best BBQ. The smell of the Bar BQ reaches you several blocks away. I had the small platter with ribs and brisket. They have several great BBQ sauces."}
{"text":"Great ribs, brisket, collard greens, and a mediocre mayo based slaw. They were out of the vinegar slaw- bummer.  The brisket was different then any I've ever had. Thinner slices with a char on it. Tasted very good and was lean (which I like). They also have a nice tap selection including Hefeweisen!  I saw many complaints about service. I sat at the bar and the service was speedy, as well as food delivery.  Granted, it was a slow time, 330p.  Give them a shot!  And ps: they validate parking."}
{"text":"While in Charlotte, NC, my girlfriend and I wanted to try the local barbecue food and were suggested Queen City Q by our hotel.  We sat on the high tables near the bar and had a view of a handful of TVs with sports games on.  For our appetizers we ordered the Deviled Eggs & Bacon which was very good as well as Southern Fried Pickles of which we were kind of skeptical of eating at first but actually really enjoyed those.  For our entrees I had the Texas Brisket and she had the Slow Smoked Chicken.  I had a piece of Texas toast added to my plate as well as two other sides.  Overall this place had decent food but wasn't amazing.  My girlfriend didn't love her chicken but the rest of the food was good.  I enjoyed my brisket although it was a bit tougher than it should've been for being true barbecue.  We would recommend this place to anyone looking for some barbecue in downtown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a quick lunch and had the pulled pork sandwich and Mac and cheese. Very good pulled pork but best of all their sauce selection is very much on point.  I think this place is owned by the same owners as Macs bbq and this would explain why it tasted identical. I will return."}
{"text":"Visited the new Matthews location tonight. Understanding they have just opened, we had set our expectations accordingly. The service was attentive, but inexperienced. We were OK with that as most of us were former restaurant workers.   However, they still have work to do in the kitchen. Two of us ordered Q City Tacos and both were missing items like the slaw and limes. They ran out of hush puppies and failed to tell the wait staff. I then ordered their onion rings which arrived at the end of my undercooked. Ick. The total bill for dinner and beer was over $100 for 4 people.   Frankly, it wasn't worth it. We might come back."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Great sides (hushpuppies and deviled eggs).  The mac and cheese was on point.  However, the barbecued chicken was ok.  The chicken was not barbecuey enough for me."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ!  I think the brisket is very good here and different than your average brisket so 100% check it out.  Also they have some of the best sides of any BBQ place I have ever been. You can't go wrong with any of them!   Great restaurant right uptown and right off a light rail stop. It has a huge inside seating area with two bars and a great outdoors area if it is nice outside.   Slightly expensive and I wouldn't recommend it if you are in a hurry, but they have a very fun spin on Carolina BBQ.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Excellent brisket. Perfect balance of vinegar and sweet goodness. Tender, juicy, just right. Collard greens are excellent, pulled pork is best I've had.  I highly recommend this place.  Advice? Make the portions a little bigger for the samplers. When people come to eat BBQ, they come to EAT!"}
{"text":"This is quite an upgrade from the prior bbq that was here.  Very good sides, very good ribs.  The sausage is good but being from the Midwest, lack some of the personality of the sausages in the Austin area.  Now, the brisket ........  Not impressed.  I really enjoyed the food, but this is where they fall short on authentic.  Midwood smokehouse has nailed a great brisket, but the whole sauced and grilling of a piece of precooked and cooled brisket just does not do it.  Staff has been great on several visits."}
{"text":"I went to this place for lunch yesterday to have the ribs since I always here people talking about great they are. The ribs were pretty good not the best I've had but decent the sides I ordered though were disappointing the Mac and cheese was flavorless and boring the green bean casserole was not good at all I didn't even finish it. On a positive note though the service was pretty good and the restaurant itself is pretty nice..."}
{"text":"Crappy service, unless at the bar. Food was decent, but the 19 year old manager trying to figure out tickets had no customer service skills. They weren't prepared for our party and kept us waiting for 45 minutes for our tickets. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Good service for our large group. The food was so so....our pulled pork plate was a bit over done and dry, as were some of the other meats on our friends plates.  The eastern bbq slaw was sitting in an inch of sauce. It was more like a soup than a slaw. My shrimp taco was excellent. Overall, a bit overpriced for mediocre, but very edible food, with very good service."}
{"text":"Terrible service from the male bartender Matt.. seems him and a waitress have something going on... absolutely the worst customer service experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"I've worked uptown for years and finally made it here for lunch with a friend last Friday. As a BBQ fiend, I was excited to check it out. Upon entering, I immediately loved the atmosphere - two separate bars on either side and all kinds of tables in the back with an overwhelming (in a good way) smell of barbecue. Mmmmm....  We were promptly seated, even though it was just after noon and the NCAA games were on. Our waitress was prompt and friendly in the beginning, but we had to flag her down after our food came just to get more water. Eh.  Onto the food! I figured I'd start with the basics on my first trip and went with the Pulled Pork Sandwich ($9) which came with slaw (I ditched that) and a side, so I got the first one on the list - mac & cheese.  It arrived pretty quickly, and the first thing I noticed was that the bun was HUGE. I grabbed some sauce off the table - they give you 6 options - and went to town. Without much (any?) sauce on the sandwich and with way too much bun, the sandwich itself was kinda dry. It was also so unwieldy that dipping it in sauce wasn't possible, so I just kept putting sauce on the sandwich after each bite... I know, classy. The mac & cheese was pretty darn tasty and creamy.  Overall, the atmosphere was great, the service was a little iffy, and the sammich was tasty, but Mac's and Midwood still have it beat - however, a solid option for BBQ if you're uptown."}
{"text":"Decent barbeque located uptown. I think since moving to the Carolinas, I've become quite picky when it comes to barbeque. After a fun night at Discovery Place, we decided to try Queen City Q.  Customer service was okay, but we did have to keep asking other servers for refills. I felt like when her server did stop, she was constantly in a hurry or also running a drink to another customer.   The food was good,  but not the best I've had. I was pretty hungry. We ordered the hushpuppies and pork egg rolls as an appetizer.  The hushpuppies were good and came with a honey butter. They were greasier than others I've had which kind of turned me off. The egg rolls were better.  They had a nice smoky taste, but I wish they came with more sauce. For my main course, I had the smoked chicken with collard greens and Mac and cheese. The chicken was tender and was smoky. I also appreciated they cook it with the mustard sauce, which is my favorite sauce. The greens were probably my most favorite part of the meal. They tasted like they had been cooked all day with a ham hock and were full with flavor, with just the right amount of vinegar. Mac and cheese was good.   Average barbeque joint with average service. It is probably the best barbeque uptown since there's only one other one I can think of."}
{"text":"Continuing on my food tour of Charlotte, Wednesday night found me at Queen City Q. The place was hopping (meaning it was an electric, sort of party atmosphere) but grabbed take-out. I ordered the Medium plate which included three meats and two sides. I chose ribs, chicken and links. And my sides were greens and mac'n cheese.   The meats: 1) ribs were moist and tender to the bone. They weren't \"falling off the bone\" but I don't like my ribs like that anyway; 2) chicken was very flavorful and had that wow-factor; 3) links were nothing short of AMAZING. I don't how they do it, but I've got to say it was probably the most delicious smoked link I ever had.   The sides: 1) Mac'n cheese was just o.k. That bar was set pretty high by this other place I wrote about in another review; 2) Collard greens were some of the best I've had. They were properly prepared and very flavorful. Those are just two of a list of side dishes all of which I can't wait to try. But in general three sides I always use to represent a place are greens, mac'n cheese, and yams/sweet potatoes.   Overall 4-stars for Queen City Q. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went out Sunday for Mother's Day and my wife and kids wanted to try Queen City. The waitress was nice and was doing her best..... looked like she might of had to many tables. The hostess was up front on her phone most of the time. Management was lacking awareness of what was going on and either did not care or lacks experience. It is my opinion this place might not be open much longer. I don't plan on giving a second chance since Charlotte has many options for BBQ. I like 521 and Shane's always consistent but always looking to try others.    I was right place is closed and a Mexican restaurant is in. I have been going to this place once or twice a month. Fantastic place"}
{"text":"It has went down hill fast.  The new bartenders are just rude,  I went in on Friday and one bartender did not acknowledge my presence much less serve me a beer.  I have spent a lot of money in that place but I wont be spending any more!"}
{"text":"$12 for deviled eggs? $10 for chile with mac n cheese? I was really hoping for this place to be amazing as I love barbecue but just opening, and I was literally the only person in there. Bartender was super nice, she showed me the happy hour food menu, so I went with the barbecue nachos with brisket. It said Mini but it was still $8.50.. but that's not too bad I guess ... but when it showed up in literally a salad bowl, I told myself I won't be back.. there is way better places to go, R & R down the road, Macs speed shop... all priced better and better portions..."}
{"text":"This is a fun restaurant with a variety of BBQ choices. I got the Beef Brisket Quesadilla and it was tasty. The side of Mac and Cheese was good as well. The prices are fair and there is a pretty good drink menu ($5 house wine...win). I highly recommend trying this place.   If you park in the 7th street parking deck, you can get your ticket validated in the restaurant.   We went with a large group and their back room is perfect for these types of gatherings....just call in advance to reserve."}
{"text":"I ate here during the Wells Fargo championship at the event.  It was he worst beef brisket I have ever eaten.  Don't waste your money on this place.  The customer service was terrible they had the nerve to be counting trays and foil.  I have a huge following of people I share my food list with and this did not make the cut.  I would give it a zero but they do not allow it.  :("}
{"text":"Best barbeque in uptown; but definitely not the best in Charlotte. It seems that Queen City Q has broken the curse of this location.   The interior is pretty cool with multiple bars, a few more intimate booths, and sky high ceilings. This place was much bigger than I expected.   The pulled pork plate was great, the pork retained its juice well and was not dry at all (I'm looking at you Smoke). Nice smoke on the pork as well. I really enjoyed their signature BBQ sauce. It is an eastern Carolina vinegar sauce with more of a tomato sweetness and viscosity.   The sides are what you would expect from a BBQ place. I had the mac and cheese along with the hush puppies. Both were good, but nothing memorable.   I hope to see Queen City Q stick around for a while."}
{"text":"All the food was great! We had but, ceacer salad, fried pickles, beef brisket, mac&chs, coleslaw. Best brisket! Bartender, Alyssa, didn't seem to friendly and bit stand offish at first but we did warm her up and made a good come back."}
{"text":"The food is good. If you're stuck uptown and want some \"Q\" as it were, this is a great place to get it. It's exactly what you might imagine an \"uptown BBQ\" joint would be like. Busy bar, \"club\" type music, \"fancier\" country fare (if that makes sense - this ain't no paw's country cookin') and a generally more \"uptown\" clientele. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, if pricey, food - pulled pork with a bevy of sauces to choose from, wings, mac & cheese, hushpuppies. It might be a tad ambitious - the night I was there (granted it was a Saturday night, right before a Bobcats game), the service was slow and it seemed like the kitchen was very backed up - I wonder if they have too many tables."}
{"text":"I love the Q.  I think I've been there a couple dozen times.  There are so many great things about it.  First of all, the beer selection.  It's definitely one of the top 3 beer spots in downtown Charlotte.  If you want a local beer, there's no better place to try them ALL. And they keep their beer menu up-to-date which is important with such a rotating list of seasonals.  The food is fantastic.  It's not the cheapest BBQ places around, but it's definitely the best downtown.  Heck, I'm a vegetarian (well, pescatarian...) and always find plenty to eat on the menu.  A great selection of salads, the fried pickles are super tasty, and they have some outstanding fish entrees, such as tuna tacos and a tuna \"burger.\"  I visit frequently before and after arena events, especially when the Charlotte Checkers are playing!  There is only one reason I'm giving the Q only four stars, and it's simple:  Thursday nights.  You see, they have trivia there.  And while usually I'm a fan of trivia, it's absolutely, positively, the loudest thing ever.  I don't know why the guy running it believes that you need to have giant speakers and boost them at 98 dB, but he does (yes, I used a decibel meter to see how loud it was, that's loud!).  It's painfully loud, and there's nowhere in the place to go to avoid the noise.  Blaring music, yelling into the mic.  It's just unpleasant.  I've walked in there twice on Thursday evenings and turned around and left because I couldn't handle how loud it was.  So, as long as you don't go on a Thursday evening you are sure to have a great meal, an awesome beverage, and a great time at the Q!"}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with this spot!  I had been in this building when it was the old restaurant- and I don't even remember it's name.  Concord Mills area has a ton of dining but it's all super chainy.  Happy to have another option though there's tons of chain BBQ around here.  I came here for lunch to catch up with an old friend.  I had the BBQ pork plate with collards and Mac n cheese.  She had a salad.  My pork was awesome!  I especially liked the Mac and cheese as well.  It tasted fresh and had awesome flavor.  The collards were also tasty and had a little kick.  She enjoyed her salad but it wasn't BBQ per say.  Service was good....but it was lunch and not too busy.  I think people don't realize this is here!  I noticed they had a $3 local draft special- and considering it was Friday- that's a great deal!  I will be back and will bring my husband!"}
{"text":"This place is fun. BBQ is good and their bar is top notch. They have my favorite pumpkin cider here in the fall!"}
{"text":"0 stars. Placed an order online and they \"could not find my order\" when they were contacted 1.5 hours later. Pathetic!!!!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite in the QC to get bbq. Staff is awesome, service is good, little wait time for food, and they validate parking. $3 Good Morning Vietnams on Fridays are a huge plus"}
{"text":"The food was okay, not great. I had the smoked sausage, overall not that impressed. The service was horrible.  We were a party of 8 and it was as though no one wanted to wait on us.  I was there at lunch we fellow employees and it took us 2.5 hours to get in and out- and there was no wait for a table... It just simply took them that long to greet us, get our drinks, find someone that wanted to take our order... It just wasn't a good experience.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"We were walking by deciding where to eat and the smell pulled us in.  The service was great, the food was better.  We ordered the pulled pork and the texas brisket, with mac and cheese and hush puppies.  Everything was hot fresh and delicious.  That honey butter is awesome with the hush puppies."}
{"text":"Meatloaf had good flavor and did not need the ketchup it was smothered in.  The corn maque choux tasted great and the sweet potato fries. The ribs were not good. For a BBQ joint I expected the ribs to be better."}
{"text":"Checked out Queen City Q before a Charlotte Hornets game.  Just a short walk from the arena, this place is a great option to feed Q fanatics.  Our group ordered a large Q Platter, which is a sampler of the meats they offer.  You can select 2, 3, or 4 different meats.  We went with the large and chose brisket, sausage, pulled pork, and chicken.  We liked all, but the favorites were the sausage and pulled pork.  The brisket was okay, but a different style for the Texans at the table.  Fried okra, mac and cheese, and onion rings rounded out this healthy dinner!  All of the sides were really good.  Atmosphere is nice.  Big, open rooms and a huge bar.  In spite of the pre-game crowd, service was friendly and prompt.  The only downside is their skimpy selection of beer if your taste is more on the Pils or Kolsch side.  They have several craft offerings.  Overall a great experience and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Very excited to try this new spot Uptown on 6th right next to Brixx.  Heard a lot of buzz so the boyfriend and I went in on an off night to see how we rated the Q.   They didn't change the layout so much from La Vecchia's.  Bars are still in the same spots, they have booths and tables and high-tops available too.  A number of large TVs make it seem like a cool place to watch the game.  Outdoor seating will be great in the summer!!  Close to the arena this place will be hoppin during basketball season!  The interior seems lighter and brighter now - super cool red walls and Western-y decor.  Firewood for the smoker (I didn't see it but I didn't really look) on display visibly in the dining room!  Each table has on it several sauces to try.    I had the BBQ platter which came with two sides - I tried the macaroni and cheese and the green bean casserole.  The pork was smokey and tender.  I like to eat mine sans sauce to really taste the flavor.  But I did try the sauces, there was a mustard-y one, regular and a spicy one.  All were very good if you are a sauce person.  The macaroni and cheese was creamy and delish!  The green bean casserole was savory and had tons of fried onions on top.  All portions - super plentiful.    Probably they will validate your parking if you ask - for the parking garage.  We walked so we weren't in need.  So I will definitely be back to this great spot!  Super convenient and very nice service.  Best Q in Charlotte?  Sorry that honor still goes to Midwood Smokehouse.  But this establishment definitely tops Macs in all areas.  I want to try the brisket next!  If their brisket comes close to Midwood then there could be a tie......"}
{"text":"With all of your options in Charlotte for BBQ this place definitely takes the cake for being low-tier BBQ. It's speaks volumes of the place when on a Saturday evening the place was only 1/4 full at dinner time.   The place is clean and the service was good so they've got that going for them! They serve cheer-wine too which is always a great option here in charlotte.   As for the food it was nothing to write home about. I got their chili burger with fries, and hush puppies. Everything was just bland. The BBQ sauces were all bland too.   I would recommend this place for a post work drink (cheer-wine for me, beer for the colleagues) but will not be visiting again for dinner. VERY AVERAGE FOOD."}
{"text":"I come here almost every week. Excellent food  never had a bad meal. The service is always solid. Only gripe is the sappy country music."}
{"text":"Looks and tastes like a franchise. Decent food but not the N Carolina experience I'm looking for coming from California. Lots of beer on draft...5 stars for beer selection."}
{"text":"enjoyed dinner here last night.  very good BBQ and service.  great place for large groups."}
{"text":"So I went here bc I got a gift card for Christmas. I read reviews before so didn't seem like I would be that impressed but of course went anyways so I wouldn't waste the gift. Bbq not good, mainly their sauces...they all are terrible. I feel like the sauce can make or break bbq, but either way both were bad. Fries not even that great. Weird ambience there...they literally were playing \"cops\" on the tv (with an investigation on drugs or something). So weird. I kept looking around like, why is this on?   I'm giving 2 stars and this is solely because they have a good amount of beers, and a full bar. Drinks specials too! So that's how they are getting two stars on me. If you want good bbq...go to midwoods. Still hands down the best bbq in Charlotte! I've tried everywhere"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and today was the worst experience by far. The food was good as usual, but the service was lacking. We were there around 12:30 & there was 1 other group seated at a table so it was really slow. 4 minutes after we were seated a waitress walked over to a group of servers & informed the lady that we had been waiting. She took our order and made 2 more visits during our time not including the delivery of our check. Again the food was good, but the wait staff this afternoon was more interested in socializing than attending to the guests."}
{"text":"I love that they have this new spot so close to me! You normally have to drive out of Matthews to find a location like Queen City Q. I wish I could give this place a five star rating but it has a few downfalls. Let's start with the pros. The food is delicious!! Everything is so well seasoned and flavor packed! My favorite meal happens to be an appetizer. The NACHOS!! Omg! So good. You can really order any entree and share, cause it's a good amount of food. Now I must discuss the cons. Over priced a wee-bit. I can go to Texas Road House and get the same quality of food and pay $10-15 less. You have to pay extra for anything and everything. Honey mustard? Extra! A roll? Extra! Always extra. Needless to say, I like it here but if I'm forced to choose between here and other places that don't charge me for honey mustard, I will be going to the other place."}
{"text":"Horrible. Steer clear until managers hire more staff. Waited over 15 min at the bar without acknowledgment. Were seated by the kitchen-lots of food waiting to be delivered. 15 min later most of that food was still there and we hadn't gotten as much as a turned head from anyone.   Those poor girls working (we saw 3 waitresses) were doing the whole floor by themselves. Looking around I didn't see a single smiling face.   We left through a crowd of waiting customers- who hopefully had enough sense to get their parking validated like we did before leaving..."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Queen City Q. After going to the location Uptown too many times to count, I was happy to have one open closer to home. They have great drink specials (Hello, $3 Charlotte drafts on Friday) and they have a secret Happy Hour menu. Not really, I just never knew about it until recently.   My go-to picks are smoked wings w/ BBQ sauce - probably my favorite smoked wings anywhere. Second would be their smoked chicken, comes with 2 sides and the portion is huge! You can't go wrong with the nachos either.   If you find yourself waiting in the long line at the new Mac's in Matthews, head over to Queen City Q!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Queen City Q for an event this weekend, and I will definitely be back!  The place had a great vibe for Checkers pre-gaming - there was live music, Chubby himself was even there! They have 2 bars, so you can easily find a seat - and they had $3 NC drafts on a Friday night (not sure what their other deals are).   The food - well you can smell the smoke from the 7th street station and that gets your mouth watering. I had their pulled pork sliders, a couple of smoked wings and their homemade chips. It all left me wanting more. Can't wait to go back and try more of the menu and their sauce selection!  Staff was friendly and they validate parking in 7th street station. By the way, it's the official pre-game spot for the Checkers!"}
{"text":"My husband and I both got the pulled pork platter. Loved the variety of sauces at the table. The collard greens, corn, and sweet potato fries were EXCELLENT. The Mac n cheese was okay and the meat felt a bit dry for me. But the aforementioned sides!!! I think I will get the side sampler next time. Oh and the service was very good too. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We've had Queen City Q a couple times at the Spectrum Center and BB&T ballpark and really liked the pulled pork and brisket sandwiches. We saw they had good reviews for wings so decided to stop into the axial restaurant for some good wings. While the food was great, the service was awful. There were only a few tables in the whole restaurant and it still took 10 minutes just to get our drinks and we continuously had issues during the meal like not getting sauces or sides."}
{"text":"Awesome sliders! Brisket is perfectly done and the sauces choices are as varied as the people in this great city. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Tagged along with a friend to try this place out the first week it opened. Perhaps it was just the opening week kinks, but overall it was all sorts of \"Meh\".  Prior to its inception, everyone had been raving about Queen City Q because it is apparently the brainchild of the same person who founded Mac's. This may seem sacreligious to all a' y'all, but I've always found Mac's to be vastly overrated amongst the local Barbecue community ::dodges rotten tomatoes and pulled pork being tossed in general direction:: Sorry! I just think there are better options out there. (See: Bobbee O's, Midwood Smokehouse)  Still, I approached Queen City Q with an open mind and an open heart. After al, I love me some barbecue! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the \"best Mac and Cheese\". The pork, while plentiful on the portions, was nothing to write home about. Just your basic pulled pork, with the Uptown prices. The \"best\" Mac and Cheese? Hardly. Pretty arrogant of a place that just opened to call run of the mill Mac and Cheese the 'best' on their menu. My friend had the beef brisket, which was decent (again, I've had better), and we were offered a sample of their St. Louis pork ribs which were great for the price (free!), but were greasy and fatty -- I don't see myself paying the $12+ to get it for an entree.  In short, Queen City Q isn't terrible, but what it lacks is the \"I'm definitely going back for......!!!\" factor. For everything I tried there, I thought to myself how it tasted better at Midwood Smokehouse, just a mere 2 miles up the road.  Will I go back? I'm not hurrying to go, but I'm sure I will find myself there again for whatever reason. They did seem to have a very good beer selection, although I wasn't drinking this particular evening. To win me over, however, they are really going to need to step their game up with their food, and then I will gladly re-review."}
{"text":"Went tonight before the Hornets beat the Heat. We sat at the upper bar and redheaded Stephanie was great. She made sure to follow up with us about our drinks and food. This is why I continue to send family,  friends and clients."}
{"text":"Best BBQ joint in Charlotte! The Mac n Cheese is amazing and they have a great selection of local draft beers. Anyone staying in uptown and looking for some southern BBQ, must stop by QCQ!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, mac and cheese was the best, sweet potato fries are great, Stacey was a fabulous server."}
{"text":"We went for an early lunch on Sunday. The service was great as we were the only patrons. The food was decent. We tried wings, brisket sandwich and collard greens."}
{"text":"I should have gone here a couple of months ago when they opened....I regret not going sooner. This is a GREAT place all around, The food is outstanding, Service Great! We had the Hush-puppies with Chipotle Honey butter to start..Fresh and Crisp and Hot, delicious! I had the Beef Brisket Sandwich, so many places around the Queen City have this and they are dry. this sandwich was cut into small strips, with onions and sauce and it was to juicy and good. My side was the Fried Okra, it was fresh fried and so tasty! My partner had the Pulled Pork Sandwich which was loaded and good. The Beer assortment was fantastic lots of local craft beers,  with my favorite from Wooden Robot brewery. If your by the Sisky YMCA  stop in..Don't miss this one!"}
{"text":"Forgetaboutit.  The one I ate in was at the Time Warner arena when I went to see the Knicks play the Hornets.  The brisket sandwich is INSANE.  Better than any I have eaten.  It's that freakin good.   After I ate the dam sandwich I didn't remember why I was there in the first place.   All I was thinking about was that delicious lip smacking sandwich.  Wait, what was I talking about again? Oh yea the freakin brisket,  I couldn't tell you how anything else was because I can't stop thinking of the brisket,  brisket.   Now get off your fat ass and get to the stadium to eat."}
{"text":"I'm a fan for sure.  I love the laid back atmosphere.  Me and the girlfriend hit this place up on a rather dead Monday night but that didn't stop the great service or freshness of food to our table.  Service was very attentive and experienced.    The food was fantastic as well.  I order the shrimp po'boy sandwich and it was the size of my head!  I like that, have I told you I like to eat lately? I do.  It was really good, can't complain one bit.  The girlfriend actually got a plate of the pulled pork and I stole a bite off her plate (sneaky).  It was good, smokey, moist, etc.  All things as it should be.    Seeing as how this place is the newest of a few uptown BBQ places that are popping up uptown I think I will certainly be back for more.  PS.  Midwood is still my #1, sorry but it's true.  I have to get in my car to get there though :)"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time to try out the food with my sister. The beer recommendation from the waitress was perfect. My sister ordered a sampler platter but that's when the issues began. We assumed that the ribs would be sauced but we thought the chicken and brisket wouldn't be sauced so we could pick our own from the wooden basket of sauces on our table. When the order came luckily the brisket and ribs were covered in a sauce we liked, the chicken was covered in a sauce my sister disliked so of the three proteins, next time we will have to request the brisket and the chicken unsauced. The brisket itself was a little tough and could have been more tender. Also, when I ordered my side salad I assumed it would be topped like a minature version of the garden salad. It was just lettuce and tomatoes, not even crutons. I still ate it because I hate to send things back or fuss but knowing how it comes, I wouldn't ask for that for the price. My sister wasn't fond of the caesar side salad either, she said it was plain. The sampler platter says it comes with Texas Toast but the waitress knew we were sharing the platter. When it came there was only one piece so we had to ask her for one more slice so we can both sample. She ended up charging us 50 cents for the extra piece of toast that we didn't know would be an extra cost. We enjoyed the French fries and mac and cheese as sides and had all three desserts. We enjoyed the flavor of the bread pudding but wasn't fond of the texture. We both enjoyed the banana pudding and the brownie and would order those again because they tasted fresh and homemade."}
{"text":"The only thing going for this place is the beer selection and the waitstaff. The brisket was pretty much like beef jerky with no flavor. The pulled pork had no smoke flavor so i doubt is true BBQ, and had to be drowned in sauce as well as the ribs. The sauces are very good. The sides also are lacking i had the green bean casserole which was basically green beans with cheese, and the sweet potato fries were your ordinary store bought kind. I recommend skipping this place and going to the Smoke Pit down the road for true lip smacking bbq! There the portions are bigger and 100 times better. I know queen city is a chain and i should not be surprised by the quality or attention to detail but if you call yourself a BBQ restaurant you better make it right and true. We take it serious around here!"}
{"text":"The meal here was lackluster at best. I asked for a modified version of an item and the waitress said that they could accommodate. However, when she brought out my plate, it was the opposite of what I ordered. I settled for the chicken salad wrap, which was just ok. My date ordered the Texas Brisket Sandwich with macaroni and cheese, which he thoroughly enjoyed. However, his first beer was lukewarm. The place was nearly empty when arrived and the atmosphere seems like a cool after work spot.   I would not come back to this place.   **Disclaimer: I do not eat beef or pork, so my review is to be taken with a grain of salt.**"}
{"text":"Overpriced and their brisket was below average at best. Midwood Smokehouse is far better and better priced."}
{"text":"This place is great, especially after 10 pm. My favorite is the 50 cent smoked wings from the very reasonably-priced late night menu. Personally, I think they are just as good as fried wings and much healthier. Even the South Carolina BBQ sauce is good, a make-or-break thing for me coming from SC."}
{"text":"OMG.... I'm a long-time QCBBQ fan for years but it looks like accountants have moved into the kitchen. I used to claim that they had the BEST wings in Charlotte (smoked, baked, plump and only $6/6) but they are now $9/6 and SMALLER!!! This is a real disappointment. Additionally, they boil their brisket (ugh), sear it, then slop sauce on it... Totally gross. I would have thought that they'd have improved their brisket with the new menu... NOPE!  I get that chicken prices have increased but to reduce the customer wing experience by 50% (not accounting their reduced size, too) is ridiculous... After 50+ visits to QCBBQ I'll look elsewhere for good food... Call me pissed! Accountants stink!!!"}
{"text":"I definitely wouldn't call this the best BBQ in charlotte. I haven't been to some of the local BBQ places, but I'm not betting on a chain to be the best BBQ in the city lol. I've been to three other places with similar offerings that I would choose over this place. I'm just saying.   Anywho, even though it's not the best in the city the food was still good.  Ive been here twice. Once I ordered the smoked wings which were really good because I love smoked wings, but the flavor I ordered was like it wasn't there at all. This most recent visit we started out with the queso. What a let down. It was like dipping a chip in cheesy water or some type of fluid. Note to self don't get queso from a BBQ place. We moved on to the smoked chicken plate. It was decent. The chicken had a nice flavor to it, but nothing to phone home about. It would have been nice if the chicken was pulled instead of on the bone.  I got the hushpuppies and eastern Carolina Cole slaw with my meal. The hushpuppies were the star of this dish, because the honey butter they serve with it is amazing. The coleslaw on the other hand.... I'm a Carolina girl, so first of all we call it red slaw or BBQ slaw! Second of all it was way too spicy to even enjoy, and I like hot!  I probably won't be back here unless it's free lol."}
{"text":"Basic restauranteuring 101:  Bar seats suck.  They are generally high tops, located in a drafty, high traffic area.  They are not a great place to have dinner.  Which is why most places don't include them in the waiting list for the main dining area.  You shouldn't either."}
{"text":"Food was delicious.. BEEF BRISKET TACO was crisp yet soft/moist.. Chicken Taco was very tasty with a lil pop to it.. Service was great. Hostess very friendly. Server Nicole very friendly and hooked us up.. Turned reg Diet Pepsi into Diet CHERRY PEPSI.. OH YEAH. My friend enjoyed a Pull Pork Quesadilla and loved it.. Highly Recommended..."}
{"text":"Good bbq. Ribs were cooked well but lacked flavour. Pulled pork was dry but had flavour. The sausage was best. Slaw sucked. The baked beans were good. Nice selection of beers. Definitely A bbq RESTAURANT. NOT JOINT. It was a little bit over priced for the quality"}
{"text":"The pork at Queen City Q is hand-pulled slow roasted bone-in pork butt, and it makes for a sandwich that's tender and juicy.  The meat is piled high and topped with a lightly dressed cider cilantro slaw.    While we noshed, Chef Dan \"Boone\" Gibson chatted with us about the evolution of the restaurant.  Boone's laid back, down-to-earth demeanor transfixed us all-it felt like we were sitting on his back porch drinking sweet tea as we chatted about his mom's baked beans and his aunt Nell's mac and cheese.  I'm a big fan of sonya's salad with shrimp.  I'm not a big fan of the service, which is consistently lacking."}
{"text":"Queen City q is our go to place in Ballantyne for bbq. I love their pulled pork, hush puppies, slaw, Mac n cheese, pimento cheese and my husband loves the corn Mac choux. I have eaten at a bunch of bbq places and I feel like Queen City Q is better than most. I def think their bbq and hush puppies are better than Midwood.  The service that we have had has always been pleasant and on point.   I def recommend Quuen city Q!"}
{"text":"I went here just last night for the Queen City BBQ, Bourbon, and Beer Festival. I don't think it really was a festival though. I imagine the rain had something to do with it, so there was not crowd-gathering corn hole tournament. To be honest, upon walking into the restaurant, it didn't seem like there was a special event going on. There was an impromptu table topper with the specials.   I was really happy with my meal: a crunchy, coleslawy shrimp taco, bbq slider, sweet crispy potato fries and a beer flight. The bbq was smokey and toasty. I tried some of the eastern sauce (NC style vinegar) and it was missing a little pizzaz but was still a great compliement. Very good local and craft beer selection.   Considering there was live music, it wasn't crazy loud just a guy playing some other guy's tunes. The space was not at all like any bbq place I've been to. Not at all smokey, carpeted, or lodge-like. It seemed like they should open it up as a dance hall on weekends. I really think a contra caller would set this place off.  Be sure to park in the 7th st. station parking deck!! Other decks won't take Queen City's validation... That may or may not be a well known fact"}
{"text":"Came here hungry and left happy!! I tried the Big Q that includes 3 meats and I chose the chicken, brisk and ribs. The chicken was moist and delicious, the ribs were tasty but the brisk was very dry and glad their was hot sauce. The meal began with mac and cheese poppers, then the potato fries.   The place was clean and nice location and I recommend this place. Enjoy the place as I did."}
{"text":"Everything about the place is great. The atmosphere is laid back, the servers are attentive, and the food is delicious. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This superb BBQ joint in the heart of Charlotte's center city serves up juicy pulled pork, delicious mac n' cheese, and one of the best local beer menus in town. With more than a dozen craft beers on tap, you won't have any trouble finding something to wash down your 'Q. They also validate parking, which is a big plus. The atmosphere is also great, whether you sit inside or on the spacious patio next to the light rail. Bryan Meredith and his team have launched a great addition to the Charlotte BBQ market, and Queen City Q is fast-becoming my go-to spot for lunch in Uptown."}
{"text":"This isn't real BBQ. The brisket is grilled, the chicken is extremely dry, and the ribs are all bone.   Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I had a great experience there for a Saturday lunch. The servers were so amazing and patient with the silly 2 year old putting her greasy hands all over the windows. All the ladies working there were kind and seemed very happy, which seems to be increasingly rare in restaurants. Bbq tacos were awesome and the baked mac n cheese really was the best. Everyone cleaned their plate.  I even liked their pork rinds and I usually hate those things! Loved the service we received.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good barbeque joint. Better than all the national chains around here. It's a local chain with 3 restaurants in the area. Honestly it's more of a 4 star, it's really good but I need to drown out the 1 and 2 stars below because this place needs to stay.   Wings are smoked, not fried and not rubbery. Fall off the bone and the best way to do them. Pulled pork was great. Same with chicken ribs and baked beans. McRib? Packaged meat? Come on dude. This isn't Chili's. Better than Jim and Nicks that's for sure. Great local beers too."}
{"text":"Food. Order the 4 choice of meat ( brisket, rib, sausage, pork ), fried pickle, Mac and cheese, green beans.   Food was better than the last BBQ place I had gone to, but hey I'm from Texas I know what real BBQ taste like. The brisket was good, everything else was meh. Mac and cheese was not great, fried pickle was good.   Service was horrible, i didn't get to put in my drink order, she left to get the first order of drink rather than waiting for 3 people to put in a request. When we were done eating our food we were waiting to get our server attention to get a to go box. But what was funny how we asked a server who wasn't our server,didn't want to get it for us.  He pointed where our server was, who happen to see she should attend our services. Not only that but our server was so stupid that when we asked for the check she said can I get you another beer. Had you checked on us earlier maybe, but not when we asked for the check. Duh, common sense.  Servers eat in front of the customers, they mingle and drink in front of our faces and you see the hostess flirting with the bar backs. Had I known this was a mingle for people who hated their jobs and wanted to hang out, I would have gotten my food to go and and not see a social place where people just want to sleep with each other after work.   P.s we were the only table they were serving!"}
{"text":"So I love BBQ....and to have a place in town is very C O O L.   I dropped by one night and the place was dead, so I tried last night (Friday) and was pleasantly surprised to find the place filled with all kinds of folks.  I decided to sit at the bar and order a BBQ plate...............wow, was I surprised.  The bartender, as nice as she was, wasn't the best one I've ever had....good intentions, but slow on delivery mainly because she was both serving customers and getting drinks for the dining room.  Decor wise the place had been repainted, but other than a few items on the wall and some old wood covering up some parts of the room, not much different than previous tenants.  When dinner arrived, it was a H U G E amount of pork!!!!!!!!!  Not the mention the 2 sides added to a mound of food I could not even attempt to finish.   But it was good!  Very good.  All of it.  So I ate what I could (this plate is big enough for 2 people) and took the rest home.  FYI:  Like Brixx next door, they'll pay for your parking upstairs (a plus)"}
{"text":"The food here was good. Not great, but good. I liked the variety of sauces on the table. Well, our neighbors table, before relocation. The menu is approachable and variety is good.  The problem I had was with the beer. I had to get up from my table to go look at a beer list with no descriptions in side (from sitting on the deck). There was no bartender and our waitress couldn't tell me a decent local IPA. ...Really? Not one?  If it were me, a regularly updated printout of beer selections would be a pivotal components of my restaurant. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Checked this place out last night with a bunch of Twitter peeps and was really pleasantly surprised! It's got that slick downtown look but the kitchen is kicking some amazing pulled pork sliders!  They weren't the shredded up, over-sauced bit I've come to associate with pulled pork--these were closer to sliced pork, with a tangy cabbage/greens topping and were simply tasty. At $2, pretty darn big, too. I ruined mine by trying to eat with a knife and fork though; just hoist it up by hand, potential sauce stains be damned. Fries are crispy and well-seasoned too, and look to be hand cut. The owner has a great backstory as well--I was told he went out of his way to hire people who were unemployed. Not transitioning to another job, but who had been looking unsuccessfully for work for months. Well, he sure picked the right ones because the food is great, the staff is friendly and the service is quick. This is going to be a lunchtime staple. And it's right off the seventh street station, so you don't have to futz about parking, but if you do, they validate?? Love!"}
{"text":"Very nice, family friend restaurant. Nice selection of BBQ and great brisket cheese steak. I ordered that with a side of sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"I was in North Carolina for work and a large group of us (20 or so people) came to Queen City to get some bbq. I was really happy with the experience, from the trivia to the well-priced drinks and of course the delicious ribs! I was able to try both the fried pickles and hush puppies to start, and both were great. I ordered the medium sized St Louis ribs, which ended up coming with 8 large bones and 2 sides. I had the mac n cheese and the collard greens. I wasn't a huge fan of the greens, so if I ever went back I would probably go with the corn instead because it was deliiiicious! It was overall a really fun atmosphere and very accomodating to groups!"}
{"text":"So I'm in the Queen City on business and I'm scoping out the top restaurants/bars on my Yelp Mobile App.  These folks had great reviews and they were close to my hotel. That's a win, win for me and off I went for and early dinner. I had such a great time that I stopped by for lunch on another day and also visited just for an adult libation or two or three.  I'm delighted to say these folks earned four stars from me.  I loved the draft list.  Expect a nice selection of local brews.  Whoever selected the beers also made sure there was a nice mix of styles of beer.  That's not always the case and I was impressed.  There is also a substantial bottle list.  Nothing goes better with Q than beer so the start of a good meal is in place.  As I was traveling by myself, I sat at the bar for all of my visits.  That was good news for me because most of the time my bartender was Andrew.  He was friendly and efficient and a great conversationalist.  He also knew his beer. He would have been perfect if he looked like a Victoria's Secret model but hey, I guess you can't have everything!  On one visit I tried the DEVILED EGGS & BACON as an appetizer.  For $4 you get 4.  They were delicious with a big spicy kick.  On different days I tried both the SAUSAGE and the BRISKET.  You know the Q is really excellent when the meats can stand on their own without any additional sauce.  That was absolutely true here.  Both were tender and juicy and packed with flavor.  As with most Q places there is a long list of sides.  I sampled the CORN MAQUE CHOUX. HOUSE CUT FRIES, EASTERN NC BBQ SLAW, and HUSH PUPPIES. All of them were fine but OMG the corn!  I think I moaned when I tasted it.  That's embarrassing!   Expect a platter here with two sides to cost you $12-$16.   The portion sizes are just fine and you'll be full.  When I visit Charlotte again it's certain that I will return."}
{"text":"I have dropped in for lunch several times over the years and each time would be deserving of 2-3 stars.  I eat alot of bbq and while Its not bad by any means, it is forgettable.  I keep stopping by simply for convenience.  I had high hopes today as I went with a group, some first timers and no one was impressed with the food or service.  Most of us got the pulled pork which was pretty dry and bland and i've come to expect that here but the lack of service today is going to probably keep me from coming back.  Once our drinks and food were brought out there was no other sighting of the waiter until our checks were dropped off, no refills on the drinks, no asking if anything was needed, etc."}
{"text":"We went on a randomly packed Wednesday night. (The Hornets were playing.) Despite the crowd, we were seated quickly and received very attentive service. There was some confusion with our beer order -- BF ordered an IPA and very clearly received a brown ale -- and one of the waiters was a little argumentative when we pointed it out.   Food was a little hit and miss. The nachos were great! (Although an upcharge on $14 nachos to get about 1/4 cup of guacamole is a rip off.) Apricot chipotle wings were average -- the sauce was way too sweet with no spice. And, last (and coincidently least) was the tuna taco. I know, I know. Why'd I order a tuna taco at a BBQ restaurant? I was asking myself the same question after tasting it... The taco was cold and flavorless.   We'll likely be back -- you can't beat their offer to validate parking in the uptown 7th Street Garage just for stopping in for a beer or some food -- but will be wary of the tacos."}
{"text":"Sweaty as balls inside, and the chandelier is so dirty you think they got it 2nd hand from Disney's Haunted Mansion.    Great beer selection, but food is inconsistent, some times the Corn Macque Choux blows your mind, this weekend it just blew."}
{"text":"Ordered a medium ribs entree. This portion actually was pretty big and I had left overs. The flavor was very good and even better with the extra side of sauce I requested. For sides I had the greens, which were also good and the corn maque choux, which I loved. Because I like cornbread with my greens, I ordered a half order of hush puppies with my meal, which were excellent. Earned a place as my go to spot for barbecue in Uptown."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of local craft beers, daily specials, the smoked meatloaf is a specialty only on Thursday! Almost all the sides are made in house daily for great fresh food. All meat is smoked on the premises daily as well. Dry rubbed so you can pick the sauce."}
{"text":"I was expecting to be disappointed. Especially with all the Texas oriented decor. Boy was I wrong. Great beer selection and the meat was superb. Sides were ok. But ribs and pork were great."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while and had the opportunity to do so before a concert uptown.  I figured I'd have a seat at the bar like I always do when trying out a new place.  It looks like they have two bars here...one to the left of the door and one to the right.  I chose the one to the right.   I was  presented with the draft beer menu and they have a great selection of craft beers including many local beers.  They even have a chalkboard on the wall to support the local beers but sadly, I was disappointed when Triple C was not on that list.  They also have a very extensive bottled craft beer selection.    They have quite a few options with the menu but I was here for the 'cue...just regular pulled pork.  That's what I ordered with sides of green bean casserole and slaw.  It wasn't even 10 minutes  from my order time that my food arived.  The plate was full.  The barbecue was flavorful and could easily stand on its own.  But there were 4 sauces to choose from to add additional flavor.  None of them really stood out to me but that's ok since the 'cue was amazing.  For the sides, the grean bean casserole was tasty but the slaw was about average.  Service-wise, it was great when I first got there but I ended up waiting for a 2nd beer and again for my check.  Also the bar is cramped.  Chairs or lined up right on top of each other.  Overall a good experience.  But please, get some Triple C beers in there!!!!"}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. Not incredibly authentic and divey, kind of had a chain feel. But isn't one and does BBQ very well. The beer selection was absurd and not too pricey at all. The BBQ menu was extensive and almost impossible to choose.  I loved the pulled pork, hush puppies with whipped honey butter, homemade chips, corn mix thingy with bacon that was amazing, ribs, and everything else. Sauces need to be better named so you know what they are, but tasted good. Nice and large and reasonably priced, so come here!"}
{"text":"We've been here multiple times and have never left disappointed. It's an Uptown BBQ place, so it's not a down home country Carolina feel, it kind of feels like a chain. But, the food is great, the servers are friendly, and the location (right off the rail, next door to 7th Street Market) can't be beat.  I love the hushpuppies, the pulled pork, the baked beans, and the mac and cheese.  Their non-traditional BBQ offerings aren't bad either: the sweet potato fries are solid, and yes, the nachos are especially good.  Taken for what it is, QCQ is a really great place to eat.  We bring guests to Charlotte here every time we get a visitor."}
{"text":"Queen City Q @BBTBallpark!  Brisket with mac n cheese.... Yes!  This was really good and I would get it again over almost anything!!!  I left off the bun (cause I carb loaded on the mac n cheese instead).  I really love #bbtballpark and I'm glad #queencityQ is a part of it."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if possible. Worst barbecue I've ever eaten. The meat was flavorless and all of the sauces were the same (and all bad). I grew up eating barbecue in eastern NC and this wasn't even CLOSE. The hush puppies were burnt globs of cornmeal that oozed grease. The honey butter was good. That's about it. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk into Queen City Q it's hard not to get your hopes up. I really wanted the food to knock my socks off but unfortunately it was just OK. I'd certainly come back but a few other barbecue joints in Charlotte (Sauceman's and Midwood Smokehouse to name a few) are better. We started off with the Pimento cheese dip which was excellent!  It is served chilled and with what seemed liked homemade chips to dip with. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. To me the pork was a bit dry as was the bread it was served on. They were also a bit stingy with the coleslaw they put on top of the sandwich. I've had many a sweet potato fry in my day and these were just OK. I've had better and I've had worse.  On a positive note, the service was top notch. Our server was very attentive, stopping by frequently (but not too frequently!) to either refill drinks or ask if we needed anything."}
{"text":"Lunch before March Madness games in Charlotte. The Mac & Cheese was delicious & my oldest son said the bbq was really good."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first visit to Queen City Q, with its generous and tasty portions and quick, friendly service.  The open dining room offers a casual setting. The bar seats about a dozen, and there are several TVs around the perimeter for easy game/event viewing.  I had the classic pulled pork sandwich--the tender pork being so plentiful I had to ditch the bun (good, I'm sure) in favor of a fork and knife. Your choice of sauce awaits on the table. Luckily, I had just enough room after the main event for a side of their \"best\" mac and cheese and light, crispy coleslaw. The beer list was solid and offered a nice spread of N.C. brews. Our server was friendly and efficient.  For me this was a quick walk from Time Warner Cable Arena (right off the light rail line, too) and an inviting post-game-chow option. It's a nice casual dining addition to the Uptown area."}
{"text":"Queen City Q was just what we needed after a long day of traveling. The beer selection is large with lots of NC brews. The pulled pork plate was huge and cooked to perfection. The collard greens were especially tasty and just salty enough from the bacon they were cooked with. They have a bunch of great barbecue sauces here--one from every major barbecue region. Use the eastern NC sauce with some cholula hot sauce. They have a ton of TVs and a few big projectors which makes it a perfect place for watching NCAA tournament games. The service is fast and all the staff were very attentive and friendly. Even though it's a huge restaurant the quality of food and personality of the staff made it feel like a small hometown barbecue joint to which I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Queen City Q is a fairly recent addition to the Charlotte BBQ scene. Located close to the 7th St. light rail stop, it's a perfect place to ride & dine. A few weeks ago Calvin and I walked uptown from our house, participated in a twilight 5K race and had a great dinner here before taking the train back home. If you don't live close enough to walk or take the train, parking is validated in the adjacent deck. In addition to a huge indoor dining room and full bar, there is a nice patio where we sat.  We decided to share an order of the onion rings appetizer and The Q Platter - you could choose up to 4 meats but since we love BBQ pulled pork we doubled up on that and had the brisket and the ribs as well. All of the meats were smoky, succulent and tasty, particularly the St. Louis ribs. It was also a portion big enough for a third person!  Queen City Q has a wide variety of sides including all of the usual suspects plus a few innovative additions like corn & edamame salad. Our chosen sides, mac & cheese and BBQ slaw, were good choices but I'd like to return to try the greens and sweet potato fries. Salads and tacos, two types of chili and Brunswick stew are also offered. I also like that they include Texas toast with the entrees - yum! I look forward to dining here again and trying more menu items!"}
{"text":"Very nice ambience in a great location. I got a BBQ plate with collard greens and vinegar coleslaw on the side. The BBQ was quite good. It had a good smoky flavor with the right amount of bark which I love.  The flavor of the BBQ was tasty and didn't need any sauce except for it being a little dry. The collard greens tasted good but were overcooked and soggy. I came in for a late lunch so maybe it was it sitting longer. The coleslaw was pretty bad to where I could barely eat a bite. I know coleslaw can vary a lot, but it's rare for me to not be able to eat it.  It was very heavily soaked in a sweet apple vinegar. Even when I tried to drain the vinegar with my fork the vinegar flavor was so overwhelming I couldn't eat it. I would come back and give these guys another chance, but it's not on my favorite BBQ list either."}
{"text":"Very good barbecue, nice craft beers, Sweet potato fries, and barbecue sandwich were all very good.  Nice atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Well, just went here for the last time.  My wife doesn't eat bbq but goes there for me.  She really doesn't like the food there in general, but found she could eat the BLT, when it wasn't on the greasy Texas toast.  They have been putting it on a hoagie roll for her...until tonight that is.  Apparently, the owner found out they were putting it on a hoagie, and told them no.  Yes, you heard right... an owner.  Apparently, they are unaware that Midwood Smokehouse just opened on the opposite side of the street from them.  Guess what?  We walked out and went across the street.  Guess what else?  Midwood food is much better.  There are so many places to eat, why spend your money in an establishment like that, with terrible ownership.  They just elected to lose business, rather than put a BLT on a hoagie roll, instead of Texas Toast.  I guess hoagies are very costly."}
{"text":"Doesn't appear to really be NC style bbq but that doesn't mean it isn't good!!!   I had ribs and sampled some of my friends brisket. The ribs were pretty tasty while the brisket was a little dry. The sides weren't bad either.  Purists probably aren't in to Queen City Q but I liked my ribs and the beer selection was solid so I can't complain."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their barbecue is to die for. This time I just came for the bread pudding. I normally don't eat bread pudding, but this one is deep fried with a side of vanilla pudding. It's so good!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was good (really liked the mac n cheese), but my husband put the official axe on this place. He felt like the portions were too small for the price. He specifically asked if the meal he was ordering was filling, unfortunately it wasn't enough for him. He ordered the \"Big\" Q Plate.   I also thought the portions were on the lighter-side. Mine came with two very small tacos and a small side for $12...a bit steep as everything was pretty small, but it did fill me up.    If you visit Midwood (down the street), they are priced similarly, the food is of equal quality, and the portions are easily double. I'm not one to sacrifice quality for portion size, but I think they could manage both better. I would check it out for lunch or if you're not super hungry."}
{"text":"Local ownership. Delicious food. Supports the community (Official BBQ of the Charlotte Hounds)! Great craft beer selection."}
{"text":"There is really not much to say except this is probably the worst BBQ I have ever had. its just bad, overcooked, not very tasty ect ect. The Iced tea was acceptable though."}
{"text":"The other day we were near the mall - yes, around race time - and decided to grab a bite. Strangely, there was actually less traffic around the race than at other times. I'm thinking that they may just publicize this race thing to keep people away from the area, and in fact it might be a good time to get your shopping done.  Regardless, we decided to stop into the Queen City Q location across from the mall, and found that it too did not have a huge crowd - busy, but not full. The menu was similar to the one Uptown, but I don't know that it's identical.  Staff was friendly, but they seemed to be a bit off of their game. It's not that they were bad, but they were just a bit slow by comparison. Just a the point where you start wondering why your glass isn't quite full or where your food is, and start looking around, you notice them, and a moment or two later, they come by. Uptown, they are typically on it before you can even think.  When it comes to the food, the flavors are there, but they seem a bit sanitized - instead of seeming warm and welcoming, everything is good, but on baskets or white plates. Again, it's not that something is missing, but it just feels lacking, like someone stole grandma's recipe, and they are making everything work, but they left out her special ingredient (which, as we all know, is love), so you feel like you are missing something when you are done.  Compared to the other restaurants in the vicinity of Concord Mills, QCQ is definitely a win - but compared to the other location (Uptown), not quite as great."}
{"text":"There are times I don't get uptown for seemingly weeks, and then there are times I am uptown for several days in a row. During one stretch, it seemed like I ended up at QCQ multiple days on end, just because it was convenient - have to love being at the bottom of a parking garage, as it makes it so easy. The food options aren't bad either.  Now if you're a vegetarian, you might have a tough time, because even the veggies are cooked in bacon. So if you don't like bacon, you might want to examine the menu closely - or eat before going to you can try the liquid diet at one of the two bars.  Once there, however, there are some decent food offerings. It's not the best 'cue the city has to offer, and in fact it's not even the best thing on their menu. I would suggest that you try their wings. This isn't because they are the best wings you've ever had - they aren't traditional if you are looking for Buffalo wings, but because they are first roasted, and it gives them an amazing flavor. Worth a try every time I've had them.  Everything else? Not nearly as exciting, but quite decent all around. Those wings, however, are making me hungry right now. Might have to figure out a way to get uptown..."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, but the food is awful.  BBQ should be low and slow not rushed or under cooked like my three past meals.  Go for the beer and eat in advance."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best BBQ in Charlotte.  I usually frequent the uptown location before every Charlotte Hornets game.  Parking is validated with the purchase of food and drinks.  Since I had enjoyed the uptown location so much, I decided to try the Matthews location out since it's near my house.    The layout and design definitely sets up the mood for BBQ.  The wait staff are incredibly nice and knowledgable about their menu and there are also always great drink options including local draft Friday's w $3 Charlotte draft beers.   I've eaten almost everything on the menu.  In fact, you could blindfold me and have me throw a dart at the menu and I'd be good w whatever is selected, however, the one must try item for any beginner is the corn maque chow!!  Queen City Q, best BBQ in town!"}
{"text":"I'm a barbecue snob but this Bbq sandwich was so good pulled pork great smoke flavor.  Great sauces I like vinegar base but there are 4 to choose from  . There Mac n cheese was true Mac. Cheese not the powder that some places are using it was creamy an baked mac n cheese :) we also tried there banana pudding it was amazing don't fill up you'll want that desert or get it to go:) we also ordered the nachos Wow 3 of us ate them. It was Bbq n brisket an chicken if I remember correctly .  This will be a great lunch n dinner place it used to be Elwood's a great change :)"}
{"text":"We were hungry and ordered too much food and none of it was a stand out. You can't get all flats - makes me think the wings come pre bagged in sets. We had wings, pulled pork with fries and onion rings. We came in on a Sunday night and the place was way too quiet. Should've known then to skip it. I wouldn't come back here; there's better BBQ around."}
{"text":"This is a great choice for casual dining!  They have a great assortment of traditional BBQ dishes and some excellent variations like their beef brisket tacos. The beef brisket is wonderful, and I've tried several of the sandwich options - all excellent. They offer a good range of craft beers and some delicious desserts (great bread, puddings). Try it!"}
{"text":"Lots of meat on the plate with the Super Q. Everything is good BUT the sausage is perfectly off the charts. Crisped up with a mustard sauce. The pulled pork is juicy and tender with nice flavor, no sauce needed. Ribs and brisket are good. The NC slaw is right on and tangy. I'd come here everyday for this stuff."}
{"text":"Excellent local restaurant.  Great beer and drink menu.  Hard boiled eggs are the best!!!!  Fab brisket.  Definitely a must for date night, couples and families.    Jesseca is the best waitress!!"}
{"text":"Great food and not expensive. More of a beer selection on tap than most places in the area. The service was great and everyone was friendly! Go"}
{"text":"I don't like BBQ, but I LOVED our dinner here!   We went with our moms for Mother's Day and we couldn't have been more pleased with the experience. My husband and his mom shared one of the Q platters. HUGE servings of four types of meat. They had the ribs, chicken, brisket and pulled pork. The only thing my husband didn't love were the ribs (he thought they were too smoky). But my mom ordered ribs for her dinner, and she loved them. So, I guess it's a personal preference.   I had the brisket and it was perfect. Not too much sauce, and the meat was tender and had a ton of flavor. I think everyone ordered mac and cheese for their side, and we all loved it. My husband had the baked beans with sausage and was really happy with that. The sausage wasn't overwhelming and the beans had good flavor. I had collards that were pretty good. Not as good as what I make at home ;), but still delicious.   We didn't get dessert, but we started with the pimento cheese dip and housemade potato chips. Both were amazing! I was expecting a warm cheese dip, but it was cold, full of flavor and delicious. The chips were sturdy and perfect for it,"}
{"text":"Mmmhmm. Sit me in a comfortable but modern atmosphere, and give me a toasty plate of pulled pork barbecue with two delicious sides and I am one happy camper.   Queen City Q is certainly making its way into my top choices for barbecue in Charlotte. And that is no easy task!   Allow me to break it down for you...  The space: It's quite expansive with lofty ceilings, a large bar, and plenty of high tops and booths. And, they validate parking in the adjacent lot, so no worries about paying an arm and a leg to get your Q!   The service: Quick, efficient and friendly on all accounts.  The barbecue: Succulent, tender pulled pork in a delicious sauce. Plus, there are four sauces on the table, so whichever region of 'cue you long for, you can make happen.   The sides: I selected the mac 'n cheese and edamame and corn salad. Both were equally tasty...especially the corn salad. Hey - I needed something healthy-esque on the plate!   The price: Super affordable and fair. Considering that Uptown offers a dichotomy of restaurants, upper crust or quick sandwiches, Queen City Q is a nice respite in regards to both price and environment.   Viva la Q!"}
{"text":"Im my opinion, this one of the best BBQ joints in Charlotte. Hushpuppies are great as is the briskett quesadilla, pulled pork, and chicken. A friend had the wings and they looked excellent as well. Lots of local beer on tap and a large selection of good whiskey and bourbon also make it a win."}
{"text":"As a Q fan it's easy to understand why I give it a 5. What you want is what you you always get. Quality traditional BBQ served timely and hot with a variety of sauce options and scrumptious sides. I went with the brisket sandwich as brisket is usually my goto dish. You can get it on a bun or Texas Toast and I went with the toast. Nice proportion of brisket to the onions and I went with the Ribz sauce, my fav.   Mac and cheese on the side never disappoints. Got hush puppies as an app. So perfectly fried and not too heavy. Lots of craft beer selections including many locals. Service was friendly and efficient and always around to check on us."}
{"text":"Quite simply I won't go anywhere else in Charlotte for BBQ and the Ballantyne Q location has a convenient pickup window if I order ahead. Sometimes I'll just head to the bar, order a local craft beer like Birdsong or OMB and place my order there. If you eat in the restaurant the service is quick and the folks are chipper.   Most of the time we do get take out and get a lb each of pork and beef brisket (my fav) but the rack of ribs are fall off the bone delicious. You MUST have the hush puppies and Mac and cheese but give the corn maque choux a try. Love that.  For lunch I'll often get the tacos, shrimp or ahi tuna with sweet potato fries as a lighter dish. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love this place regardless of why I go. It's a great place a for a beer after work, dinner or a networking event. The brisket is my favorite, the sandwich with a side of Mac n cheese. But the shrimp and tuna tacos are awesome too. There is a great selection of local beer on tap as well with specials every day."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Queen City Q and the Matthews location is no different. Last night went and ordered to go and had a cocktail while I waited for the food. It doesn't take long. They have a Q Pack special with 2 lbs of pork, buns, sides and the hush puppies which are tremendous!   They were sampling the new BBQ Pork egg rolls which are crispy, tangy and worth an order if you want a great app! Plenty of food for a family. Kids love the Mac and Cheese and the Corn Maque Choux which is our favorite side.   They have a wonderful local craft beer selection as well and some good wines to choose from. Wednesday is half price bottle night so can't go wrong there."}
{"text":"We tried their $28 sampler platter, and honestly were very disappointed!Queen city is demoted to Kindergarten Princess. Portions were minimum basic, and sides were big enough for a small child. Ribs were not fully cooked and not tenderly coming off bone like succulent ribs I've had at other spots. Lots of fluff no real depth. Flavors were good , just felt like value was poor for price, and they are more interested in their beers than barbecue....meh, move along."}
{"text":"I WISH I could give this place 0 stars, but unfortunately yelp doesn't allow it. They have THE worst service I've ever seen. We started with one waiter who took our drink order (of water), waited about 10 minutes, then had some other waitress come over to take our drink order. We then had the hostess come over to take our order. She didn't know the difference between the two Cole slaws on the menu and continued to tell us it was her 2nd day. I ordered a cup of the chili, but received a bowl of \"chili mac\" when our food was served.   As much as I would have loved to eat that, I can't due to celiac disease. I proceeded to tell the hostess (who delivered our food) that I had ordered the chili, to which she looked completely perplexed.  She walked away and then came back to ask if I had ordered a cup or a bowl. It was a brisket chili..... without brisket. I asked for the check immediately, knowing it would take a while to get and of course we were charged for a bowl of the \"chili mac\" instead of a cup of chili.   My bf ordered the \"pick two\" with ribs and brisket, Cole slaw and sweet potato fries. He said the brisket and Cole slaw was good, but the ribs were less than average.   I've never left a restaurant hungry and irritated before. I hope I never have to again."}
{"text":"The replacement of Mario's pizza is a winner. Atmosphere is awesome and clean. Beer selection: pretty much any beer that's brewed in Charlotte. Which means it's amazing. Food: melt in your mouth barbecue. The sides are perfect. Service: once again, high score. I even ordered a to go sandwich that arrived right on time. I have found a new favorite place to eat (and drink) in Matthews."}
{"text":"CC and I had to try some BBQ while we were back in the South for a wedding recently... It was our last day in the city, and the places that had been recommended to us were both closed on Monday!  Luckily, we found Queen City Q on Yelp (open 7 days a week!) and we dropped by on our way to the airport.  It was AWESOME.  Granted, I might be a little biased after being separated from 'que for a while, but I was not disappointed by this place.  We shared the Q Platter with brisket, ribs, and pulled pork, with the Corn maque choux, green bean casserole, and (of course) mac n' cheese as sides.  First off, the platter is a TON of food.  We finished off all our delicious sides, but we had quite a bit of meat left over.  All the meats were great, but my fave was the pulled pork.  CC favored the brisket, but some things never change.  The sides were all great too, but the real stand out was the corn maque choux.  Wow.  That stuff was awesome.  I'll definitely stop by again when I'm back fown in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Food was good! We had a call in order for pick up, and it took way to long. Waited in the restaurant and host was rude about it."}
{"text":"went here to eat and was high disappointed in the service and the food. Was sent here by friends who are regulars and suggested in to me cause the like a regular bartender we asked for her and was refused her and the person we got didn't know anything about what we was served or what we asked for needles to say we will not go back or recommended this place to anyone. was of my time and money."}
{"text":"Bar staff is friendly and most the staff I have spoken with are nice enough. HOWEVER for a market already saturated in BBQ spots the food here lackluster at best. Some things are good (ribs, pork rinds, beans) some things are NOT pork is bland, bread pudding is hard & most sides unimaginative.      Also the owner doesn't seem very friendly. I heard a bartender told not to give out samples of beer. So they could push flight sales. Well for a place with a large selection to force people to buy a pint or flight, to try a beer they may not even enjoy is not a good business model.      Zoe is a great bartender. There is also a SOLID brown liqueur selection and great craft beer menu.   Had to drop a star more, they refuse to give you a choice in wings! I requested all flats and was refused!"}
{"text":"Came to NC for a wedding and after flying almost the entire length of the US we were hungry and looking for something good. Jen found Queen City Q on Yelp and we decided to give it a try.  We had the Q platter which if you are undecided is a great option.  We started with the chicken and bacon quesadilla which was awesome.  The platter was awesome and the brisket, which past experiences have delivered dry and bland, was actually really good.  you could seriously taste the grill which I loved.  my opinion on ribs, which also come on the platter, is that the minimum requirement is that they fall off the bone, after that it's all up to the sauce.  The regular sweet sauce is right up my alley and I loved it, but if you like variety they have 5 or 6 more versions right on the table for you to try.  The topper was that our server along with all the other staff were very friendly and helpful to us tourists looking for things to do.  Even other employees that were doing their side work or.other duties didn't seem bothered my our questions and took more than just a minute to stop and visit with us.  What a great reflection upon not only the restaurant but Charlotte as well.  Anyone looking for good BBQ and very friendly staff must go to Queen City Q."}
{"text":"Literally the best BBQ I've ever had in my life, I savored every single bit of the Super Q (yes, I took it down all by myself!), absolutely phenomenal brisket, sausage, chicken, and pulled pork.  Highly highly recommend, service is fantastic as well, it is reason enough for me to visit Charlotte!"}
{"text":"We stopped in one evening recently. My son and I shared a 4 meat plate and my wife had the 2 meat plate. The food was good but it was over priced. Our check was $64 plus tip. Their prices need to come down to be more competitive with other BBQ around NC. Our server was great."}
{"text":"What happened? The last two times my family has come here, they are wildly understaffed. Slow service, which I'd normally not complain about... if the food was good. Our son couldn't eat his burnt chicken fingers, and since our server was working every table, we never saw him to say anything. Collard greens were soggy. Other food was lukewarm. And I have to go somewhere else anyway to get my son dinner. Seriously, a grilled cheese, sausage hoagie and chicken fingers. An hour and a half and not even enjoyable.  New owners? New managers? Whatever it is, they are understaffed at all times.  It's a shame, because we loved coming here. Never again.   I'll be going to Midwood smokeshack from now on."}
{"text":"This place was advertising at the Checkers game last weekend so we decided to check it out after the dismal loss we had just witnessed. After eating there I can tell you I will definitely be back (probably after going to hockey or basketball games).  Our waitress was really nice and super attentive but not in that \"if she asks me one more time if i need a refill i will lose it right here\" sort of way, and our food came out to us really quickly. Now usually when my food comes out that fast I question whether or not I should eat it, but I was starving and it turned out to be a good choice in the end. I got the BBQ tacos with mac and cheese and enjoyed it, but added some extra sauce to the tacos myself. They have a few sauces on the table to choose from, which I really appreciated.   It was also cheap and my friend was able to get wasted without spending too much money."}
{"text":"Well another place promising the best barbecue in town and then just offering a retread of the same thing everybody else does.   First on the positive side the hostess and our waitress were the highlights of the evening.  They greeted us warmly and acted like they cared that we were there.  Our service was quick and our needs were taken care of. Very friendly and professional. Our meals were OK.  The meat was fine but a bit dried out.  The sweet potato fries were tasteless and lacked any texture.  The slaw had a bit too much vinegar taste. We wanted to see about having them cater a party and were told the manager would have to help us so we asked to see him.  Somehow it was too much trouble for him to even stop by our table and answer our questions.  As a matter of fact he never seemed to visit any of the tables to check on his customers.  I guess hanging out at the bar is his purpose in being there. Oh well there are a lot of places that value their customers.  We'll just get our barbecue from someone who cares,"}
{"text":"Went down there because they are a Charlotte Hounds supporter and we were picking up our season tickets and stayed for dinner. Wife and I split all 4 different types of tacos and we enjoyed them all.  Our son had a vegetable plate so we could try the sides and the Mac and Cheese was delicious.  Will be going back again."}
{"text":"This Matthews location went out of business fairly quickly, When it came up on our community website many residents expressed they were glad as the service was terrible and the servers and owners were extremely rude. I guess they can get away with bad service downtown but it will destroy a business in the suburbs.  A taco restaurant has since opened in this location which treats customers well. Hopefully it will be there a long time!"}
{"text":"Great service for a group of 20.  I tried a platter with brisket, pulled pork, smoked sausage, ribs, and a couple of side dishes.  Entirely to much food for one person...lol.  I wanted to try a little bit of everything since it was my first time eating here.  Excellent food, I did not like their sauces."}
{"text":"I really want(ed) Queen City Q to thrive here, but it feels like service has consistently gone downhill over the last year. I recently had a family member pick up a called in order. She went in & paid with cash. She was supposed to get over $5 back in change but the hostess or bartender told her they didn't keep more than quarters on hand for change and that she should just consider it a tip for them."}
{"text":"I have three words to describe this place: SLOW and just okay. We were sat immediately and our drink/appetizer order was taken immediately. That came out in decent time after that, things slowed all the way down. I order a pull pork platter with mac and cheese and corn. All pre-made items....not sure why it took so long. I had enough time to drink a full glass of tea and eat 6 hush puppies. Thank goodness I wasn't full because the food was just okay. I couldn't settle on a sauce that I actually liked so I really only ate a few bites of the pulled pork. The corn was interesting there was a lot more meat in it than I expected. The mac and cheese was good but it lacked seasoning. It's on my list of been-there-done-that won't be back. Trying to get out of there I thought I was going to have to shoot off flares she walked past the table at least 5 times after she gave me my check. it wasn't until I flagged her down that she actually came back to pick it up."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, quick service. I had the pulled pork sandwich and mac & cheese - both were very tasty, and our server was friendly.  The BBQ sauces were not as good as other options in the area (very watery), but the food was good overall."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with this \"barbecue\" joint at all. To begin, our server had a bad attitude with a constant smug look on her face. Very bad way to introduce your company to new customers.  We walked in and you could smell the \"barbecue\" so I was excited. Then they brought out the plate. Everything looked great until I tasted it. The barbecue had no smoke flavor whatsoever.  It was basically roasted pork butt from the oven. I could have made this at home.  The collard greens were very salty. So salty that I only took one bite. I absolutely love great collards and these were terrible. However the fried okra (frozen) were the only decent thing I had during this meal.  We wanted to give dessert a try but the \"waitress\" immediately gave us the check without asking if we wanted anything else. Sad to say, but we wont be patrons at this fake barbecue joint. I will give my business to others who show an interests in their customer.  Bad server + bad food = stay away."}
{"text":"Stopped by off a recommendation of a friend. It was a lunch Sunday kinda crowd. We got seated within minutes and the service was excellent. Had the pulled Pork Sandwich with fries. I wouldn't say I'm terrible picky about my Q but I know what I like. The portion was HUGE and the BBQ was really good. The only downside to some may be the choices for sauce. All seem to be vinegar based and one mustard based sauce. If you want something thinker Kansas City/Memphis style not gonna find it here. Lastly, we'll be back to try some other menu options."}
{"text":"Just returned from a Yelp event on Sunday night at Queen City Q and I must say that this place is special. First of all, the staff and the owner are really lovely and made us feel so welcomed. The location itself is very comfortable, clean, and inviting. The food was perfect; excellent mac n' cheese with perfect balance of cream/oil/soft/crunch. This is a dish many people think they're cooking correctly when they're actually not, but Queen City Q gets it. They've perfected their mac n' cheese and it's worth ordering. The bbq pulled pork was very nice; excellent flavor and not even remotely dry. The housemade sauces are all so good I was piling them on, on top of each other. They've got a very nice seasoned shrimp app. and of course the banana pudding deserves an honorable mention. In fact, if you went for the banana pudding alone this would be time well spent. Queen City Q. has perfected that as well."}
{"text":"Queen City Q is a great--and affordable--addition to Charlotte.  Located in LaVecchia's former location, the restaurant is airy and nicely redone inside.  I tried them for lunch the other day with a friend and will definitely be back.  I'm a Mac's Speed Shop fan and it's really hard to tell the difference between the two.  That's a good thing, because that means I can now get great BBQ in Uptown. Q's BBQ is very moist and tender, with sauces on the side to add to your taste.  I'm a huge fan of mac 'n cheese, and theirs is excellent.  My only complaint with the food was that my sandwich fell apart after a few bites - the bun just couldn't hold up to the juicy pork and sauces.  I'll have to try a platter the next time.  My friend and I were in a table off to the side, and our server seemed to forget about us.  She never once checked back with us once they delivered our food, and we had to flag her down to get our check.  I only hope service will be better on my next visit!"}
{"text":"More and more I am reminded how awful people have it in the south. The food here was so disappointing, we left after an appetizer and one drink I had to share. Why only one drink? Well, I would have ordered my own, but our waitress never offered or returned. Seriously. Why is service such garbage in the south? Here's how the experience here went... We were searching for a place to eat while visiting Charlotte for the day. Yelp reviews led us here. So we walk in and are greeted swiftly. Place looks clean. Open feel. A few tables were seated in the bar, and in the main dining area, there was only one table. The host puts us at one of those half booths in the corner. First sad moment....not crumbs, but pieces of food all over the booth and bbq sauce smeared all over the table. While I get up to wash my hands, our waitress swung by and took a cocktail order and appetizer order. I didn't see her again until after we were halfway done with the appetizer. Chewing on whatever she had been eating in the back, she comes by to check on us. I'll admit, she's nice enough. But where I come from, you would be fired for ignoring a table for more than two minutes. We had the pimento cheese....I'm told this is a must have in this part of the country. Tasted horrible. Like salty canned cheese mixed with cream cheese. I've been promised that ill get to try the good stuff one of these days cause this wasn't it. The cocktail arrived after our appetizer. My friend who ordered it, couldn't even choke it down. I have 8 years bartender experience under my belt....so I'm familiar with a bad drink. This was a pre mixed long island. My friend who ordered it, physically cannot drink pre mixes due to a medical condition. Neither of us want to touch it. And after waiting another ten minutes for a server....I'm done. So as soon as she's back around I hand her my card and she settles the bill. She INCLUDES the full drink we've been unable to drink in the bill. You just don't do that in customer service.  In conclusion- attentive service was so lacking....I only SAW our server twice. Food was unremarkable. I felt cheated walking out of here. We found another place."}
{"text":"So happy to have a local place with good food, great drink specials -- they have a ton of local beers on tap too! -- and good service!  The brisket tacos are damn tasty and the ribs, wings and nachos are great too! We have eaten there several times and will definitely go back soon!"}
{"text":"On a month long BBQ trail roadtrip through the Carolinas, Florida, NOLA and Tennessee Queen City Q ranked top 2 ... loved the ribs and chicken.  AND the nachos with pulled pork and Queso  at the Charlotte Knights baseball game were mind bogglingly good...yeah so good I made up the word bogglingly!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 4 stars because although the service was great I would say the food is \"meh.\" We had the mac and cheese with brisket chili and the noodles were over cooked and it lacked flavor. My ribs were good and the pulled pork was good as well but every sauce is vinegar based and they taste relatively the same and all very strong in that regard. I wouldn't put this at the top of my priority list to go back to."}
{"text":"I always receive great customer service whether I'm with my family, a colleague or whoever.  I came in last night with an out of town guest and the first time in many visits, there was a mistake in my order.  The appetizer came out after our main meal and my sandwich was incorrect.  No big deal as there was just some minor differences.  I said I was fine with it as long as the correct mean was billed.  Andrew, working the bar, ended up taking care of everything which was totally unnecessary.  He went above and beyond.  He is an example of the staff I've experienced every visit.  Thanks.   You really can't go wrong with the food.  They have meals for folks who don't want too much and fulfilling entrees for those who want to go all out.  There brisket is great and they serve it in several ways: taco, quesadilla, sandwich, cheese steak and of course classic meal on its own."}
{"text":"Order from door dash for lunch during work one day. Portion size is great and food is good but nothing to rave about. I would definitely recommend though as it is good bbq!"}
{"text":"Queen City was recommended to me by a Charlotte local. I tested him by asking him what made it special, the meat or the sauce? He said, the vinegar marinated meat, and sauce is for sausage and chicken! Right then, I knew I could give his recommendation a try. I did, and there was no disappointment! I ordered the deviled eggs for an appetizer, they were good w/ a little bacon garnish on top. Entree was the Super Q sampler....(don't be fooled by the last word: sampler) it was a sampler if 4 grown men ordered an entree each and decided to share with the others type of sample. 4 full size servings of your meats of choice! And, 2 side items which I tried the fried okra and Mac n cheese. The sausage was made in house and tasted great w/ the mustard sauce grilled on there. The brisket was great as well! My hat goes off to the ribs, they had a nice caramelized char of the vinegar and rib mop sauce so you didn't need to add any add'l sauce( fall off the bone good), and lastly was the vinegar pulled pork, also no sauce necessary, but feel free to pile it between the Texas toast that comes with the dish! Everything was great and the service was outstanding at the bar (Callie was my waitress/bartender). I paired the meat with the Red Oak Amber Lager, and it was just a bit sweet to punch down the acidity of the vinegar in the meat! If you're near QC, you gotta try it, 4 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This was my first time to Charlotte and had researched a place to go for BBQ. It is very commercial but very good!"}
{"text":"I really wish Charlotte had a good BBQ place, but I have yet to find it, especially after our last trip here.  The pork ribs were the best thing we had, but they were over cooked.  Everything else was just kinda bland. The menu has many choices, but nothing was really that great.  This place feels corporate, without unique flare.  BBQ restaurants need to be a little \"dirty\" and not so put together.    The beer and bourbon selection was nice.    The bartenders were very nice and attentive, even with a large crowd.  I do not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Good food, the smoked egg rolls were amazing, St. Louis ribs excellent the best part was our male sever ( forgot his name) with beard was the most positive up beat person. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Some common-a$$ food. Nothing to see here folks. Interior is lame too. Waitress was nice though. Go to Mac's or Mert's or Saucemans if you're in the mood for this type of food."}
{"text":"I LOVE Queen City Q!!!! They always put the right amount of seasonings and sauce on everything! I also love their pulled pork!!! I would recommend this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"This location can be hit or miss. We love Queen City at knights stadium and have been to the one in Matthews but this one you just never know what you will get. I agree meat tends to be dry.  Service varies depending on the waiter / waitress. The evening we dined it was middle of the week and 2 out 3 meals came out wrong. I want to see these guys succeed but not sure they have the drive to get there."}
{"text":"So my takeout smelled wonderful on the ride home...starving from a 2 hr drive I was excited that my favorite restaurant had a local spot. At first glance what I ordered looked great as usual. But after further investigation, here's what I discovered- the brisket was dry, pulled pork was dry, collard greens were a little greasy, sweet tea wasn't sweet....Queen City Q is my favorite place in Downtown Charlotte....they need a new cook for their Concord location...THE FRIED BREAD PUDDING IS OVERCOOKED...now I'm done...can we consider a new manager too? The saving grace is that I had a very nice server/cashier that took great care of me...please thank her...won't be coming back until they get it together...so sad"}
{"text":"While coming through Charlotte, I found myself craving some delicious southern BBQ. I never knew there was a difference in southern BBQ (Lexington style and the vinegar style). So I was looking for a place that would possibly have both. Queen City was where it was at and it definitely fulfilled my BBQ craving. The bartender at our hotel recommended it to us and we were excited that it was only a few blocks away (I definitely needed that walk home!) I had the beef brisket with Mac and Cheese and coleslaw as a side. The brisket flavor was absolutely melt in your mouth incredible. I also loved that they offered both vinegar coleslaw and mayo based. I was pleasantly surprised that I happen to like Lexington style best. The service was great, my only complaint was that my old fashioned was overly sweet. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I had the good idea to come check out this place as a way to wait for traffic to die down after a Bobcats game...  I couldn't have picked a better place!   I love the layout... There are multiple bars with plenty of seating and enough televisions to ensure a comfortable viewing from any place inside... One of my favorite things is that they even have specials on the weekends!  $1.75 for domestics is a great deal on a day when most places get rid of their discounts... They have a great showing of local brews as well... Everyone from Birdsong, OMB, NoDa Brewing and Four Friends are in the building and they have quite a few NC players as well...  Big Boss, Carolina Brewing, Foothills, Highland, LoneRider (YUM), Natty Greene's and RJ Rockers...  I love all the craft brewing in my state!  The servers are lots of fun and actually dress in Bobcats gear on game nights which I thought was a pretty cool touch...  I believe my female bartender's name is Jody and I know the guy's name was Joe... They were both helpful without hovering and provided wonderful suggestions...   Since the first time, I've been back twice... lol  The first time I had the Q Burger... It's a mixture of ground beef and barbecue as a burger... It was absolutely delicious... The sweet potato fries were out of this world as well... Nice and crisp with no residual greasiness... The boyfriend had the pulled pork with the macaroni and cheese and french fries... (He loves his starches...)  The sauce he used was uber tasty... I think it's called PoPo Bonz or something like that... It was sweet with a kick... I actually stuck some on my burger and it was yummy... The next time we went, they were offering the late night menu... I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, but had a raging headache, so I couldn't even eat... No problem, guys... Let me tell you, the food heats up for a second go round awesomely! lol  I popped the bun in the toaster and the barbecue in the microwave with the collard greens... Those greens are probably my favorite thing on the menu now... Bold greenery flavor with a nice peppery undertone... Mmm...  The last time I stopped in on a Thursday to watch the draft... (Note: $3 Guinness on Thursdays!) I had a smoked sausage hoagie this time with the collards again as my side... They were just as good as before... They make their sausage in house and it was some of the best I've had...  It was fresh and absolutely out of this world satisfying... It comes with mustard and slaw, which wasn't all mayonnaisey... It was a perfect meld of flavors...   They also do a trivia night, either in their back room or on the patio if it's nice enough... Fabulous!  They have a live band on Friday and a poker game on Wednesday...  This is absolutely one of my favorite places...  I totally recommend it..."}
{"text":"Just visited at Queen City barbecue for the first time and loved it! Food was excellent!!! Our waiter Tucker's service was super amazing! These days people just do the bare minimum and call it \"service\" cuddos to the staff here from the front door until we left -everyone was great. Let this be an encouragement to keep up the good work! People notice!"}
{"text":"We went here cause we heard it was supposed to be good but the place was empty and it's in a great location, the service was awful , lots of servers around but they were more interested in their phones then their costumers, it took at least 15-20 mins before someone finally refilled our drinks. The food wasn't very good either. I wouldn't waste your money here. I wouldn't even give it one star if I had a choice."}
{"text":"Meh.  Had a pulled pork sandwich - not much smoke / flavor.  Maybe competition will up their game.    Previously Elwood's, now taken over by QC BBQ which has a location uptown and serves at Time Warner (soon Spectrum) Arena.  Uptown seemed to be better but not something I would go back to.    Prefer 521 BBQ (small / local).  Hoping other options like City BBQ will be good."}
{"text":"Wow what can I say I really had high hopes for this place based on previous reviews. The ribs were slightly overcooked, brisket was dry, pulled pork had an acrid taste because it was over smoked, beans and NC slaw FLAVORLESS.  The Brunswick stew was OK, and the 5 sauces were tasty. All in all major fail for this place IMHO"}
{"text":"Love the Friday $3 Charlotte drafts! I highly suggest the nachos and it's enough food to feed two. Mostly go to the Matthews location and get seated quickly as it's not normally over crowded."}
{"text":"We had a lovely late lunch here.   One of the best Chicken Quesadillas I've ever had, even though their salsa is watery.     My boo had the fire roasted buffalo wings...   Take that fire roasted statement literally.  They packed quite a punch, but he was able to customize his order and split flavors of the wings.  He got the other half barbeque wings.  Which were no where as spicy hot.     Note: Everything seemed to be ala carte, so there are no fries, salads and barely any garnishes served with anything.    Pink lemonade was nice too.  They had a full bar and local beers!   This place is next to the Levine Museum and in the center of everything. The prices were decent and the menu was huge.  Yay - To outdoor patio seating to enjoy the Charlotte sun, city vibe and people watching."}
{"text":"2nd time here, started with the deviled eggs again, super creamy tasty just like last time.. the pickles are fresh and crispy. Tried the chili, equally tasty, we had eyed the chili topped mac'n'cheese which I think we will order next time.  BF had the pork plate (same as last time) with the green beans and hush puppies.. it came out with green beans and baked beans. The baked beans were too sweet for our taste, good southern style I suppose. I opted for the burger which stated on menu \"cooked to order\".. I was not asked nor did I say how I wanted it cooked and it came out well done. The bun was HUGGGGE compared to the size of the burger... 75% bun 25% burger.. would have worked if there were a bunch of toppings, but not for a cheeseburger with 2 pieces of bacon... the bacon was super good thou. The burger was dry from being cooked to well done and was disappointing, I wouldn't order it again. Ordered it with the mac'n'cheese which was super good.. creamy, good cheese crust on the top. The next day had a few bites of cold pork and the mac and they were just as good, if not better, than the day before. Next round I will stick to the BBQ."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Thursday afternoon for lunch. The hubs got the pulled pork plate and I got the daily special (smoked meatloaf). Both were delicious and both plates were full of food! We also got the hush puppies and home cooked chips. It was food overload but ALL of it had a great taste and arrived to the table in a timely manner. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Upscale BBQ restaurant in the heart of downtown Charlotte. Excellent beverage program with lots of great beers and whiskeys. The BBQ itself is a mixed bag, it's kind of doing what Midwood does by having something for everyone and not really staying true to Carolina BBQ tradition. The pork and chicken is OK, the ribs are very good as is surprisingly the brisket. The greens here are very good. Service was spotty on our visit, borderline inattentive and did not bring our beverage order but the bar staff resolved it directly when I approached them and it appears to be an issue with a particular server. If I was downtown I would definitely return but as a single diner or couple I would eat at the bar."}
{"text":"Just left Queen City Q. Heard it was the best BBQ in Charlotte. Not so much. The Q platter wasn't fresh. But it wasn't enough for the three of us so after the cute platter we ordered a rib plate for me and my son that plate was hot and fresh the mac and cheese was nice and hot the ribs were hot fresh tasted great. The waitress who he seemed to be inconveniencing was pretty rude and didn't check on us when we asked for something she hurried away and didn't wait to see if we needed additional or ask if you wanted anything else not a great experience."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Queen City Q as part of Feast Food Tour's \"Soul of the South\" tour. Our group was served pulled pork sliders and craft beers with our choice of any and all of their six sauces, and they were amazing! These sliders were tender, flavorful, and served with a nice slaw on top between a perfectly toasted, slightly buttery, bun. The sauces were delicious and unique, too. The food was so good, my sister and I decided to come back for dinner the next day.  For dinner, I had the light meat chicken with a side of collard greens and corn maque choux served with Texas toast. The corn maque chouz was buttery, spiced well and delicious. The collard green were overcooked and bland. But the chicken was the most disappointing. It was dry and flavorless. So so so incredibly dry, even the sauce couldn't revive it (it ended up just tasting like the individual sauces). Though I'm sure they're likely not known for their smoked chicken, I hate paying money for bone dry chicken. (I always have chicken at home and manage to keep even light meat flavorful and juicy.)  However, despite the mediocre chicken, because very few people come here for the chicken, I'm sure, the corn and the pulled pork sliders were so good, I gave them four stars."}
{"text":"Quick lunch at the bar. Pulled pork sandwich was great. A little more creativity with the barbecue sauces would have been nice. Always like supporting local though. Definitely some character here. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"I was in Carolina & I couldn't go home without getting some 'cue. Queen City was around the corner from my hotel, so it was a short walk for lunch. Since I was by myself, I grabbed a spot at the bar and was promptly handed a menu from the nice bartender. Asked for a local recommendation for a brewski and decided to go with the Coconut Porter from Noda.   I wasn't too hungry for lunch, but I didn't want to have to buy anything at the airport, so I went with the two tacos - one pulled pork, one brisket - and a side of onion rings. Well, my order wasn't exactly right when it came out, but if you're going to mess up this Southern girl's side order, fried okra is the way to do it. The breading was perfect and they were fried a nice golden brown. Not too gooey on the inside, but not dried out either.   The tacos were a filled to the brim with meat & fixins. Both were drippingly delicious. They have a variety of sauces as most BBQ places do. I tend to stick with the sweet sauce. It added just the right amount of sweetness to each taco. I don't recall what he ordered but my dining mate that was sitting a couple of stools down also had some tasty looking grub.  Would I come back here next time I'm in Charlotte? Definitely!"}
{"text":"Ok, best brisket I had in a long time. Wish it was more that two slices. The mac and cheese wa also good. As was the chilli.  For a food truck it was super tasty"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, but a little confusing with the parking.  They validate if you park in the garage directly above them, but the sign on the sidewalk was  hard to read and we parked in the garage directly across from their sign instead.  No big deal, we learned.  It was a small price to pay for a delicious BBQ dinner.  I had the Texas brisket, which was very tender and tasty.  Topped off with some banana pudding, it was a meal I definitely enjoyed."}
{"text":"came down to NC for a golf trip and tried this place out.  First off the brisket and ribs were delicious - not something you can easily find up north.    We stayed at the bar for a while and enjoyed a few of the local NC beers.  I thought they were all pretty darn good.  The service was solid and the bar is very clean.  Definitely a great place to go for lunch or happy hour."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from Eastern NC and consider ourselves bbq \"connoisseurs\" in a way. I was super excited when hubby suggested we try a new bbq spot. We were unsure of its exactly location, then realized it was in the former Mario's. We walked in and were impressed with the feeling, a good \"county\" rib shack sort of feel. Lots of mounted tv's, making it a great place to watch sports.  The impressive bar greets you as you enter. The hostess and our waitress were very cordial and responsive. I  have read reviews of poor customer service but that was not our experience. The only complaint was the temperature; it was freezing!  The menu was typical of a bbq shack...chicken, ribs (no baby back ribs meant strike #1 for me) and bbq, along with a few surprises like quesadillas and po boys.   Hubby had the ribs which were dry along with coleslaw and baked beans. Our older son had a burger which turned out to be the best selection at our table despite being at a bbq spot! I selected a bbq sandwich and Mac n cheese. My bun was hard and food was lukewarm. My bbq lacked flavor even after adding sauce. The most disappointing was my younger son's burger ordered from the kid's menu. It was the size of a fifty cent piece. I had to make him a snack when we got home!  If you are a bbq \"novice\", perhaps this place is a great find. But for us, it's a \"one and done\"."}
{"text":"I went to Queen City this afternoon with 15 collegues from my office, for a 25 years anniversary with the Company. They had set up a nice table in a side room so we were by ourselves, which was nice since we were a little loud.  With 15 guests I was surprised to see we only had one server.  She took our drink orders and gave everyone ample time to review the menu and returned to take our order.  Being a large group it seemed like we have a variety of items, pulled pork platter, pork sandwich, sliders, nachos, quesadillas, etc. and everyone enjoyed their meals.  Overall I heard some complaints about the fries, not being cooked, and the nachos lacked meat.  They were a pile of nachos.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries. The pork was okay, not my favorite and my fries were raw...which was very disappointing because I love me some good fries.  As for the cole slaw I would pass on that, pretty dry. Overall, we had good service and the food was okay, but not barbeque that I would rush back to."}
{"text":"I'm just passing through Charlotte for business and the hotel recommended this place. Very good! I had the ribs which fell off the bone, the Mac and cheese...pretty standard but good and the corn maque choux.....holy cats! Get this! Spicy creamed corn:) the kernels of corn are still crisp and have a good crunch like corn right off the cob but in this cream sauce with peppers. Delicious! I sat at the bar and everyone is incredibly personable especially my bearded bartender. If I'm ever back in Charlotte again I'll be back"}
{"text":"We were a family of eight and had lunch here on a Friday. They had a pork pulled  special with one side for eight dollars - the  sandwich was huge and piled high with pulled pork.They have a number of amazingly delicious sides. This is a great place if you're looking for barbecue!"}
{"text":"We were in town for a weekend getaway with the 3 kids for the auto show.  We looked on Yelp and found Queen City Q.    The food was great.  The BBQ is a little smokey, but overall it was great.  They have all the different sauces you need on the table.  The wait staff was awesome and the owner/manager spent some time with us as well.  Everyone was very nice, the place was great for watching a game with all of their TV's, the bar area looked awesome with a huge selection of beers and drinks.    We fully enjoyed the atmosphere and food.  We will definitely be back next time we visit Charlotte."}
{"text":"Possibly the best bbq restaurant in Charlotte.  Wait staff is great and food is always on point. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have came here a few times and I think it's time to have an overall opinion of this place.  Food 4 stars They just made some changes to the menu, which is quite extensive for a BBQ joint.  Their wings are among my favorites (if not THE favorite). They are big and meaty and grilled. And even better, 6 for $5 (or 50 cents each on late night bar menu). Buffalo was good but I like the chipotle apricot best.  The chili is different; it was made with chunk of meats... More sweet than savory but still awesome for a cold night. The bacon devil eggs are easy to be consumed: open mouth, pop one in.  They can fill it up a little more but it is an appetizer. And the newest addition to the app menu is the giant hush puppies.  And they are good... Honey butter makes it even better.  The kitchen that started Macs is behind this joint.  While I was never a big fan of macs, I am pleased by this place.  Their smoked chicken is moist (I had dark meat). Brisket is a thick slice type.  My only suggestion is for the sauce to be toned down a little since they do have sauces to be used at table.  Some side items are lacking in the wow factor, but then I am a tough judge on Mac and cheese (and onion rings were a little bland too). I do LOVE the corn, which tastes even better the next day.    Service 3 stars While I never had bad services here, I find the waitresses to be a little lacking in enthusiasm. On my first visit I was asking for input on what to order, which I think for a newer joint like this, a convincing (and honest) suggestion from the wait staff can go a long way.  Same with beer suggestion. People, this place has a beer selection!  Again, the bartender has always been ok, but an extra wow factor can make a difference.   Location/Atmosphere 3.5 stars This used to be levacchia. Inside space arrangement hasnt changed much. Making it a little nicer and bigger than what you think a BBQ joint should be.  It is huge frankly.  It is right next to the light rail stop.  They validate parking which is great for arena events.   A little disclaimer: I met the owners, who invited a few people to taste the new menu.  Is my review skewed because of it.  Never. But I learned a few things about the place and felt the heart they put into everything.  And it makes me want to see this place strives. I mean, they actually promise they will always have the Panthers games on, with volume!  Come and try them out. Budget conscious alert: 3 words. LATE NIGHT MENU. 2 more words. DRINK SPECIALS. After 9 or 9:30pm. I know y'all are not in bed yet.  Oh wait, 2 more words. FREE PARKING!"}
{"text":"Very good. Went to a Hornets game the other day and found Queen City Q at the Spectrum Center. Very much enjoyed the pulled pork there and decided to try the restaurant. I wasn't disappointed. BBQ chicken with Carolina mustard BBQ sauce. This type of sauce was new for me and greatly enjoyed. Tangy and vinegary. The smoke on the chicken was natural and subtle. I had two side--collards (not the way I like them since they were a bit too sweet) and corn choux (something different for me as well and mighty tasty). Service was cordial and efficient. Ate outside but what I saw of the inside restaurant is appealing. One other thing:  Yelp shows restaurant open for only an hour. Big mistake as they have regular business hours. Restaurant should reach out to Yelp and change so as not to deter customers from coming. I'd like to return as well."}
{"text":"Popped in for a second meal after the vendors over at Seventh Street Market was closed. Taking two seats at the bar, we ordered a couple of local draft beers and a platter of nachos. The beers were served quickly, the nachos arrived an appropriate time later.  I wasn't impressed with the barbecue nachos. Too many chips, not enough toppings. The few bits of shredded barbecue meat on there were very dry. I would not have these again. I don't feel right dinging them for it though.  Next time, I'll go for a plate of their famed barbecue."}
{"text":"Great staff and great food !!!!  Great reward programs, lunch specials and drink specials !"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some great BBQ you need to come here!  I came in and ordered the Q platter, which is 22 dollars, but totally worth it. I got the pulled pork, brisket, and chicken. The brisket was tender and juicy, the pulled pork was flavorful and tender, and the chicken was smoked to perfection. I got mac & cheese, which was average and sweet potato fries which were great. The hush puppies are also awesome, especially with the honey butter. The staff was friendly,  and the food was great. I really recommend this place."}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ place in Charlotte! Everything was fresh and super fast. I've never had anything bad here. The mac n cheese is my personal favorite. Great spot for lunch and very friendly service!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Eaten there many times and have never had anything that wasn't beyond delicious. The choices of sauces is genius! We love to try something different even time we visit. The sides are so yummy!  They have a separate dining space for small parties and I gave my husband a surprise birthday dinner party. The staff on site was nothing but helpful and courteous to us and our guest....looking for good barbecue look no further!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice. We ordered the pulled pork plate with a side of Mac n cheese. Pork had a nice smoke flavor, was a bit dry and was not 'pulled' properly. Sauces were all vinegar based (which if that is your thing, they were pretty good). The Mac n cheese was disgusting, a pile of slop butter cheese and over cooker noodles. Our server was good, knowledgable on the menu/sauces. I would give this place one star, but the service was good so I am giving it two. If you love vinegar sauces and butter, I imagine you will rate this place higher (and you probably have never smoked pork at home either) ."}
{"text":"Meat had a great flavor but the texture was like two-day old heat-lamped to death. Bar maid was inattentive. There one minute, gone for 10 minutes?? Great atmosphere, just needs a manager/owner that cares about the product as much as the bottom line!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last week with colleagues.  As usual, the Q was simply fantastic.  I am writing this time to comment on the excellent service we received as well.  More than a couple of complaints in other reviews for these folks as written by fellow Yelpers.  So I thought i would mention that our experience was just perfect on the service front."}
{"text":"First off, I have to say this with a fair warning...this is based on an experience I had with their food truck at the Rural Hill Food Truck Rally. I have not been to their physical location, but after sampling the food from their truck, I don't think I want to make the effort to go there. You can argue that the product is different because it's served from a truck rather than their restaurant, but that's no excuse for the cruddy product I received from them.  I waited on line for about twenty minutes at their food truck before getting to order. I wanted to try a variety of stuff so I got a pulled pork slider ($3) and a turkey wrap ($5.) The pork was extremely disappointing, though the quantity of the food was worth the price. The slider was a tiny bun filled with pulled pork and a pickle...no slaw, which was sad. Yeah I know it's a small slider but they could have put a tiny scoop of slaw on it! The meat itself had no smokeyness to it at all, and the meat was tough and dry. Definitely not what I expect from BBQ down here in North Carolina.  The turkey wrap was a huge disgrace. Now I didn't bother asking what was in it, so I can only blame myself for having to eat what was given to me. Their turkey wrap was not smoked turkey, which is what I would assume from a BBQ joint. This thing was a wrap filled with turkey salad...a very mayo-y turkey salad. The mayo overpowered this wrap and made the overall product very runny. I definitely didn't taste any turkey, as the heavy mayo stood out most of all.   Based on some dry and flavorless pulled pork and an over-mayo'd turkey salad wrap, I have no intention of going out of my way to visit Queen City Q's brick and mortar location. You can blame it on it being a food truck, and that they were out of their element, but if that's the case they shouldn't be selling their wares from a truck if that causes it to be substandard. Maybe in the distant future, if the situation arose, I would be willing to give them a second chance, but that is a big maybe."}
{"text":"Bring back cable! Great food, great atmosphere, but what's up with no cable? No one wants to watch Star Trek reruns..."}
{"text":"This is my go-to stop after all the Hornets games. For starters - You have to try their deviled eggs or hush puppies. Both are delightful and truly southern staples. The deviled eggs are topped with bacon and green onions. For my entree, I got a brisket taco. It was very good and seasoned well. The atmosphere gives you the vibe of a sports bar, but with much better food."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ just a short walking distance from the Epicenter. Try the Pulled Pork Quesadilla. It's cut into 4 wedges and big enough for sharing."}
{"text":"BBQ isn't bad. The homemade hot sauce lacks flavor and spiciness for me, but the meat -- pulled pork in particular -- is worth the trip. The po boy wasn't bad either. I like coming here for happy hour. The pork sliders are the best. The free validated parking next door is a bonus. Service is SLOW . . , very, very slow."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food. When entering they have a GIANT sign advertising Charlotte beers for $3, might want to make sure they're actually on tap. We asked for 3 different beers on their list and they didn't have them. They only had a few tables and it took forever to get food and drinks. Server was very nice. Said he was filling in from another branch. Food good just not so speedy."}
{"text":"Although I work uptown, there are some  corners and alleyways that even I don't venture too often. This block is usually out of my way unless I'm headed to the market.   Sometimes it's nice to take a stroll though and revisit old friends.  With a name like Queen City Q, you better be packin' some big guns. It's as if you're aiming to not just create great BBQ, but almost emphatically looking to represent the city. While that seems like a great strategy, it has great potential to also backfire.   Most locals know BBQ. And most locals have their favorites. There is already a benchmark and any new Q joints are always scrutinized. While the opinion of the best is subject to debate,  I'd say it's safe to say Queen City Q can hold their own."}
{"text":"My wife and myself ate there Wednesday night. Loved the place.  We each ordered the que sandwich and it was huge.  Barbecue was fantastic with a wonderful, authentic smoked flavor.  This is real BBQ and some of the best I've ever had in the Charlotte area and I've lived here for 63+ years. Far better than that place right up the street.  Fried pickles were great, Brunswick stew was good, not great, certainly not the equal to what Rogers used to sell.  Cole Slaw was really good, sauces were great,  onion rings, well, not my cup of tea too much batter.  Service was really good.  Overall, I'd give this place a A-.  We may even go back tonight"}
{"text":"Great place to stop in before a Checkers or Bobcats game.  I like going here to get my 7th street parking validated and having a bite to eat/drink and then going about by business.  There are two bars, one is just dedicated to local brews, but you can sit at either and order stuff (the bartender may have to make a quick run to the other bar).  The Q has a decent offering of bar food and BBQ so you can definitely find something on the menu that will wet your whistle and curb your appetites.  Plenty of TVs around to catch a game there if needed.  I was sorely disappointed how many UNC fans I found there one night during an NC State v. UNC bball game.  I was severely outnumbered, but I am glad my wolfpack pulled out the win and broke the losing streak curse!  Everyone is super friendly and nice here, including the bartender who made sure that we got our $$'s worth out of the shots we ordered (wondered why it was taking so long) but the bottle was out and the guy didn't want to give us some (half ___(insert wording here)'ed shots) so that was why we waited a bit.  Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Visited Charlotte and was looking for bbq in Uptown. Service was attentive and friendly. Food was OK but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Came here with the family for dinner and sat outside (as my family is wont to do). There was ample outdoor seating. However, I will say that the proximity to the light rail caused a bit of a nuisance as the train would pass.  Our table of seven started off with a dozen deviled eggs which turned out to be the perfect amount. I then ordered the Texas Brisket entree with mac & cheese and collard greens as sides. To drink I ordered Larken's Patio Punch which I found to be a bit sweeter (and pinker) than I had envisioned.  In general, I would say everything was remarkably unremarkable. Nothing was bad, but nothing left a lasting impression either. I had barbecue out of town last weekend, and Queen City Q was a notch below in my opinion. I probably won't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"If you have the opportunity to travel to Charlotte i suggest stopping by here. It is in close proximity to Time warner cable stadium which means a short walk for those who are too obese to make the trip. The environment is interestingly a rough, casual bar like setting with much outdoor seating and clean surfaces. The serving staff is nice and did a good job but confusion emerged after they didn't know they were partnered with Charlottes mll team. The food was good but had drawbacks. The BBQ was good, tons of rich southern flavors perfectly paired with a wide range of appetizers. The one issue however was we were stiffed on the dang Coleslaw, I mean who can eat a pile of juicy barbecue without its right hand man? All in all this is a good place to eat but it's a little pricey, so if your willing to spend the green pay a visit to the Queen!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday around 2:00, very calm and pleasant atmosphere. Great for families. Had the brisket tacos minus the slaw and subbed raw onions for grilled with a side of Mac and cheese. Delish!"}
{"text":"Surprised this place is not busier.   Food tasty although the food took longer than I expected it was quite good.  Love the tacos and amazing greens.  Second time in.  Food was amazing and Jesseca Wa a fantastic waitress."}
{"text":"Came into town for a work related conference and knew I had to check out some of the BBQ places in Charlotte.  Queen City was the second restaurant I visited and it definitely did not disappoint.  I got the Big Q platter where you get a choice of three BBQ proteins, I got brisket, ribs and pulled pork, along with 2 sides, I got fried okra and bean casserole.  The brisket was definitely the star of the three meats.  It was tender and moist, probably due in part to the huge amounts of sauce they put onto it; looking back I'd probably ask for the sauce on the side.  The ribs were decent, definitely not the best I've ever had, but it was packed with flavor and just enough BBQ sauce.  It had a good smokey flavor and had a good lean meat to fat ratio. The pulled pork was a bit disappointing.  While it had a great taste, it didn't have a smokey flavor even though it was supposedly smoked for 16 hours.  Further more the pork was very dry and could have used a bit of sauce.  But over the three proteins together were satisfying and in huge portions. The sides were very comforting, something that could have come out of grandma's kitchen.  The green casserole was savory and delicious.    While this place probably isn't the best BBQ place in Charlotte, as proclaimed on their website, it's definitely a place you should visit if you're in town and have a craving for BBQ."}
{"text":"We like the food. A lot. It's a shame that they haven't been able to get the service right. We have been to the new Matthews location of Queen City Q at least 5 times since they opened and also placed a couple to-go orders. We have tried to be patient as they worked through the new restaurant growing pains, but unfortunately, the service has been seriously lacking - every time. From a waitress brining us the check while I was still eating my entree, to a waiter calling my husband \"chief\" multiple times during our meal, to the food taking 30+ minutes and the sides coming out wrong 3 times for one dinner, or forgetting to add any sauces and condiments to our to-go order, and so on. Despite all that, we attempted to go again tonight, hopeful that the service had improved. Did I mention that we really like the food?  When we arrived at 7:10 tonight (Saturday night), there were quite a few open tables and some tables waiting to be bussed - but we were told there was a 20-25 minute wait.  Since there were so many open tables, we asked the hostess why there was a wait. We were told that that the servers were overwhelmed and they couldn't seat any more tables. Given our history with poor service, we didn't want to take the chance on another frustrating (but yummy) dining experience, so we left to eat elsewhere.   So disappointing."}

{"text":"Review of bar staff only.  Can't review the cue because the bar staff never asked if I needed a menu.  Then after watching me review the menu I had to borrow from the guy on the barstool next to me, they never asked me if I wanted something to eat.  Yes, I did...."}
