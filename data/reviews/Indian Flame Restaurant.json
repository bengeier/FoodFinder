{"text":"3.5 stars. Hole in the wall Indian restaurant, catering the CWRU community. Hidden near the north side of campus. If you drive too quick, you may miss it. 

Once you walk in you are greeted by strong Indian spices, unfortunately a hostess does not greet you until a few minutes later. Small dining area. Pretty busy during lunch time. 

Definitely a hole in the wall experience. The dishes are chipped, the cleanliness of the glasses are questionable and the grease on the table from the last patron is noticeable. 

We came here for the buffet. Less then $10 per person. About 8-10 options to pick from. The food is not labeled, so if you are not familiar with Indian food, you may need to ask the hostess what you are eating. A few vegetarian and chicken options. No lamb :( My favorites from the buffet: yellow saffron rice, warm naan and spicy tandoori chicken.

Dessert was a deep fried donut ball, served with a rice ginger pudding. Tasty for the first bite, but quickly becomes too heavy to finish. 

Definitely a good pick for a quick lunch and at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this reaturanr! Always hit the mark. I always order my favorite Indian dish- Chicken Tikka Masala. It's made to perfection. Naan is also great! Lassi is delish! Try to make the $10 lunch buffet."}
{"text":"In my humble opinion this is the best spot to satisfy your Indian cuisine cravings. The food is continuously delicious. I have enjoyed everything I've tried in their menu (I'm always trying new things). Everything is so freaking flavorful. The weekend lunch buffet is very good quality food for your buck. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What an excellent place to eat that is fast, down to earth, and full of good food--everything that an Indian restaurant should be. Try their butter chicken which is quite good."}
{"text":"As a forward to my review, I am in now way an expert with Indian cuisine so I just judge on taste and experience. On that note: the goat curry and garlic naan were extremely flavorful and enjoyable to experience. The service is no frills but attentive, and the interior is that of any other take out joint. I plan to go back at lunch for the buffet as dinner was a little expensive at 15 dollars an entree."}
{"text":"This is an ugly hole in the wall college campus Indian buffet. Decent value, ok food, perfect if you are an undergrad. If you've been around the block, though, Cleveland has better Indian offerings.

And oh, try to avoid using the restroom there. You'll thank me."}
{"text":"The place is small, fairly new, and located in a somewhat isolated area.  There was only one waitress when we went there in the early evening.   Decoration was as sparse as it can get.

Despite first impressions, the food was excellent.  The vegetable samosas (quite spicy) and naan were as good as you can make them.  The paneer in my mutter paneer had the perfect texture.  A little bit more paneer and little less sauce would have made the dish even better.  The waitress was super nice and efficient.

If I stayed in Cleveland, I would go here every week.  Price is fairly reasonable too.  Unfortunately, too many Cleveland politicians are crooks, drunks, cross dressers with fetishes, parking meter violaters etc... and this city is going to keep declining and this restaurant will soon be forced to close.

Edit: Went there a second time with two friends and tried various appetizers that were excellent.  Papdi Chaat, Bhel, and Vegetable Samosas were all great.  Owner said the chef has been doing this for over 15 years."}
{"text":"I didn't go for the buffet, but went to ala carte, and the food was amazing!! It's a punjabi restaurant so they know their north indian foods well. you can actually tell the difference between shahi paneer (cashew based, slightly sweet) and paneer tikka (grilled paneer in sauces, spicier), and the malai kofta was truly delicious, well cooked and served piping hot and fresh (i think they made it fresh and didnt just reheat old dishes). Each dish came with a bowl of pulao rice as well. We were not expecting this, so we had a lot of food! and the pulao was delicious too. also the tandoori roti is wonderful, and the owner is a nice guy. the waiters forgot to give us our order of naans/kulchas and he came out, apologized, and made sure that we got our order and that we were billed correctly. and the price was fair for indian restaurants (which tend to be pricier), but for 5 people, we had about $9-10 per person averaging, which is not bad at all for indian restaurants. 

this north indian food is delicious (and not your run of the mill chole or paneer) and worth a visit. its a small, homely kind of place. 

I'm definitely returning back!"}
{"text":"Worse experience ever.

I signed up on Yelp to tell how awful the service at this place is. I placed an order for a delivery, and my house was less than 10 minutes away. I got my food MORE THAN TWO HOURS later. I called them three times, they kept telling me it was gonna be \"couple of minutes\" then it took more than a hour from that point, too. The delivery lady called me and complained that she can't find the way to my house."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's great to finally  have a GOOD indian restaurant ON Case Western campus. 

The food is less expensive relative to other Indian restaurants of Cleveland because they give free naan or rice with each dish. The serving size of the chicken buryani is great too. I especially like their authentic bhel puri. Overall, I eat here pretty regularly."}
{"text":"Worst Indian food .. I ordered paneer, capsicum and onion veggie n it tastes just like raw paneer in tomato sauce!! No rich gravy like a usual kadai paneer.. 
I won't try this ever.. So so unhappy with the food!"}
{"text":"I'm no expert on Indian cuisine, but everything I've had from Indian Flame was consistently delicious. The lunch buffet is a good deal if you want to try a variety of things and have a big appetite. Prices are relatively low, but not dirt-cheap.

The biggest downside is the service. The employees always seem disgruntled at having a customer in their restaurant, and it can be very off-putting. 

Personally, I'd check out an online menu, and order takeout. It's reasonably fast and minimizes awkward unhappy employee interaction."}
{"text":"We had a $15 Restaurant.com certificate so we decided to use it last night.  We ordered Chicken65, Goat Vindaloo, and Chicken Saag.  The food was delicious.  However, when it was time to pay,  the server added 18% gratuity without telling us just because we used the gift certificate.  When we asked because the final credit card charge didn't make sense, then she decided to tell us it was 18% gratuity she tacked on.  I told her that we would have tipped her 20% of the full price, then she said, well, the 18% wasn't really tip, it was gratuity. Tip is gratuity and should be voluntary for a party of 2. They should have trusted the customer to do the right thing,  Or at least have a sign that tells us about the automatic tip in advance.  Better yet don't join the promotion at all if they don't want to deal with people coming in with the coupon."}
{"text":"Price point was perfect for the Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala, and was rice was included as it should be (unlike its nearby competitor).  Most importantly, my fianc√© and I thought they were some of the best versions of those dishes we have ever had - and I'm a CTM snob.  At Cafe tandoor it would have been $16.50 plus tax for their CTM, which is good (but not as good as flames) with rice... $4.50 more than flame!!!  (And that is if they haven't increased the prices from what they show on their website and Google).  

Only reason 5 stars not given is due to the same thing that plagues most all indian restaurants: lack of common business sense and poor customer service: there was only one server for 9 tables on a Saturday night.  This likely contributed to a 1 hr carry out wait time at 6pm on Saturday night and I still waited another 10 minutes in the restaurant.  More importantly, the dine-in guest experience appeared to suffer from what I saw."}
{"text":"Before I went here with my wife for a work day lunch, I read the reviews on Yelp. The negative reviews mentioned poor service and that the food in the buffet seemed to be leftovers from the day before. So, of course, I had to see for myself. 

When we got there, more than half the tables were occupied, which to me is usually a good sign. It looked like everyone was having the buffet, so we did too. Yes, it is not your old school buffet with 100's of items, but it did feature about 6-7 hot entrees, in addition to naan, couple types of rice, and some basic salad items, and even a few vegetarian options. Both of us thought the food was very good, very flavorful. As for the service, maybe the employees read the reviews on here and changed their ways. 

There were 2 guys out in the dining area the whole time we were there, both taking orders, clearing tables, and ringing up customers at the cash register. Honestly, when I'm at a buffet, I'm not that concerned with service.

Maybe we got lucky on this day. We enjoyed our food, and will go back. I would recommend this restaurant for the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Great food at lunch buffet. $9.99 pp.   Looks like they read yelp.   They put a pitcher of ice water on our table in addition to glasses of water and had plates and silverware stacked high."}
{"text":"Not the best experience.  Food was okay - nothing special. If go for lunch, better get the buffet (which is pretty basic, $9.99), as I waited 50 minutes for a basic curry order from the menu.  Nan was also just okay - nothing to write home about.  Buffet had only chicken as the meat and mainly vegetarian items otherwise.  Service - not the best.  Could not get more water when asked."}
{"text":"Great North Indian food.  Seems like it is family run.  The food is very good.  It is a hole in the wall.  It remind you of a Punjabi Dhabha.  Pretty authentic.  We had Papri Chaat, Palak Paneer, Paneer Tikka Masal, Salted Lassi, Tomato Soup, and Plain Naan. 

I liked everything except for the Papri Chaat.  The Paneer Tikka Masala could have been a bit less sweet and less sour.  Outside of that, this is solid Indian Food.  

We recently moved to Cleveland and this will be our North Indian restaurant of choice compared to others.

Why not 5 stars?  Decor, cleanliness, and service.  Decor is sparse.  It is not as clean as you'd like (but its an Indian place).  They need more wait staff as it is pretty busy and only one person really takes your orders.  And this person forgot the Papri Chaat as our appetizer."}
{"text":"We went to this place because we wanted good indian food and it was rated four out of five stars. Do not come here. We were served water with a hair in it and when we brought it to their attention they didnt instead of them apologizing, thet simply laughed it off. The other waiters there were on their phones and having side conversations that could be heard  in the entire restaurant. The food took 20 mins to come out despite us ordering a small appetizer in an empty restaurant. Add insult to injury, the food itself tasted bland and uninspired. What was supposed to be Chicken 65 arrived as small pieces of chicked soaking in a small pool of ketchup. The food is bad, bland, and WAY overpriced, and the service was poor. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I ordered one meat and one vegetarian dish for pick up. When I got home both were meat dishes. They accidentally mixed my order with another customer. When we called back the lady was upset at us and demanded us to bring back if we want to get the vegetarian dish. My bf didn't know so he ate some of it already and she knew that, yet she demanded the dish back. . When we got there we was upset at us for eating 2 spoons out of it and didn't even apologized. 

We didn't mind bring it back but for health reasons, this kind of service is unacceptable. I hope they didn't end up giving that dish we bought back to their customer."}
{"text":"Lunch Buffet was the best!
Food hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Love the aloo gobi, chicken masala and garlic naan. It is a bit of a hole in the wall but reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This is the only decent Indian restaurant in Cleveland. Typical Indian food, but at least it is palatable. Their naan is good. They also use white meat chicken which is a change from other Indian restaurants in the area. My only complaint is that they use too much ghee (purified butter). Otherwise the place is decent."}
{"text":"I've ordered chicken and vegetarian dishes and they were both good, however the naan could have been better. 

In terms of delivery they make it easy to choose not to pay tip...you may ask why?: Because they stay in they're car!!! The two times I've ordered delivery I had to physically reach in to the car window and grab my bag of food -_- hence the 3 stars

Overall I would recommend the food, but service is sucky."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent.  We typically use Indian Flame as our go to for Indian takeout.  While the actual restaurant is a bit drab, the food itself is great.  The staff is always very nice as well.  Try the Shahi paneer, it is excellent."}
{"text":"Avoid the team who works here at 5 on Mondays! Shockingly bad service. We showed up at 4:59, the time at which you would expect them to be opening for dinner, and asked if they were open. One employee was sitting in a booth with his feet up, shoes off (on the table), and listening to music while the other simply sat in darkness. Our table was wordlessly cleared as the hostess glared at us. We felt uncomfortable. Then, our menus were practically tossed at us, again wordlessly, as she retreated to the kitchen. When she returned, we asked if we had come too early, and, after glaring at us for roughly three seconds, she snapped that, no, we were actually right on time.

I've never felt so unwelcome. Our party was large and the tip would have been sizable, but we couldn't bring ourselves to accept that attitude. We left and will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Haven't even gotten my food yet and the place is already pretty shitty and poorly run.  Ok so the food has arrived..... It's good, small portions I guess but still pretty good- nothing crazy about it but acceptable by my standards. While not my favorite Indian place in the city, actually maybe my least favorite, it gets the job done.  Oh, and the place is filthy"}
{"text":"Great Indian food, and terrific service. Flavors are authentic and not overly Westernized. The location could be better. It's a block away from where everything hip and trendy is, and could use some work, but the food and service more than makes up for it.

The Bhel puri ordered spicy was delectable, and tasted like just off the street in Mumbai without the newsprint leaking into the chutney. The Aloo Gobi was just like my mothers, and the bharta tasted like it was cooked on a charcoal stove just like the old days. The staff is detail oriented, and very helpful, and happy to be creative. They made us a delicious limbu pani which wasn't on the menu.

Even our one year old thoroughly enjoys their food!"}
{"text":"Visiting my daughter who attends Case Western. We decided to try this small and unassuming restaurant. Very nicely surprised the food was well spiced and prepared. Everything was delicious especially the Garlic Nan. Also very good value."}
{"text":"I'm no expert on Indian Food, but this was pretty tasty. I had Chilli Chicken and ordered it medium spiced since I knew there were supposed to be peppers in the dish in the first place. My mouth was appropriately burning when I finished eating and I was delighted because I love spicy food. 

My boyfriend got goat curry. I was scared because I've never had goat, so I tried it and it was fantastic. Melt in your mouth delicious and the curry was superb. I would agree with Habby, though. The service was strange, though we didn't really have any trouble."}
{"text":"Just went here again on Sunday (March 10th) and was reminded how yummy their food is. Pal and I helped ourselves to the buffet and I took a little of almost everything, even if I had no clue what it was (does anyone know the proper name for those little doughnut-hole-like balls soaked in syrup?). I can't remember what the price of the buffet was as my friend paid for both of us, but I seem to recall it's pretty cheap AND all you can eat. The one thing keeping me from giving this place five stars is the service. Everyone there is NICE, but I've had problems where dirty plates we were quite done with still sat at our table while we finished off Plate #2. And then there's trying to order delivery. They have delivery and take out option, but unfortunately I've run into a big enough language barrier enough times that I just prefer to go in person. I've no idea if they have a means of ordering on line or via fax, but they should consider it. 

And now I daydreaming about curry and naan. Hmmmm...."}
{"text":"I was looking for an Indian restaurant in the neighborhood where I can bike and get some good food. This place has very nice reviews so I decided to go there. I dont think the place is very nice but it is located in an old building so there is an excuse for that. There was only one person waiting tables in the whole place. 

I am not a big fan of classy restaurants because to me the most important thing is the food. So lets talk about it. The food here is okay at its best. I know that Indian food is supposed to be spicy but if you are going to burn my mouth and my stomach anyways why would you ask me how much spicy I want my food to be!!!  I ordered paneer chilli, which supposed to be spicy so I asked them to make it medium spicy, they made it so spicy, I had to use table sugar to make it milder. 

I will visit this place again for the buffet and may be I will change my opinion but right now it is an okay restaurant."}
{"text":"Great dal and bhindi masala after traveling the whole day. Excellent service by the server bunty. Must visit"}
{"text":"I started last month going to a different Indian restaurant lunch buffet every Saturday since the buffet food gives an idea of the restaurants cuisine close enough to the A La Carte menu in my opinion so I started to look. This was my first stop and it may not be my last but it also could have been. The restaurant itself is at the end of the Uptown region of University Circle around Case Western Reserve University almost to the other side of the tracks; East Cleveland. The restaurant is small, busy and vibrant, but small. There were not many young people there, however this was before Case begun again and maybe during the school year; the students frequent. I cannot say for sure because when I was an undergrad I ate out once a month maybe so idk maybe they are more well off, I digress. The waiting staff was not really paying that close of attention to who was coming in and out. Woe to me, but I have a nut allergy and Indian Cuisine certainly uses nuts so I have to be that person and ask. The waiting staff had no clue which had nuts and what did not. That was rather annoying until finally someone came from the back and told me what had nuts and what did not. The first time I asked, the waiter I guess thought that I was only allergic to peanuts and told me those which my allergy is much worse for tree nuts so I am glad I asked again but this time said Cashews, Almonds, etc. Anyways; the food was the typical selection of Chicken Tikka, another creamy chicken dish with nuts that I did not devour, Naan, samosa, gulab jamun, vegetable dishes, etc. It was tight fitting and there was a restroom but there was a constant line so it was not the easiest but not as bad as others. The spice was not bad at all and even children would enjoy the food since it did win in the flavor department, it was very good food and not super heavy which is a good thing. Price was gear as well, I believe it was $8.99"}
{"text":"Cozy, tasty, inexpensive. Nice place. You will have to know basically all the food that is there. You don't know what you are eating. Everything is either labeled \"VEG\" or \"NON-VEG\" . This is NOT the place for folks who don't like spicy food. If you like spicy food this is the place for you. Otherwise, everything was amazing. If you eat there, have the non-veg chicken. It is reddish and REALLY good. There is also the veg green sauce you don't want to miss out on. And the non-veg red sauce with bits of chicken inside that is the BEST food ever. The Naan there is really good! It will calm down your mouth if it is too spicy. Eat a lot of the Naan if you go there but don't like spicy food. This place is amazing and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have been to Indian Flame several times, and the food is always delicious. The cook does a great job at making authentic Indian food at a reasonable price. The Chicken Tikka Masala is my favorite, with the Tikka Malai in a close 2nd place. I could eat this food until I die!

However, and unfortunately, I might actually die waiting for decent service at this place. Upon ordering our food, the woman (not the one who owns the place - she's great) literally yanks our menus from us without even acknowledging our choices. Then, the food often takes 30+ minutes to even come out. This past weekend, while waiting ages for our food, I asked her very politely for a mango lassi shake. She again neglected to even acknowledge me, but instead walked back to the kitchen, brashly pushed open the door, turned to the cook just enough so I could see her roll her eyes and say, \"add a lassi shake\"... Then, when it came out 10 minutes later, it wasn't even a shake! It was just a normal mango lassi. 

I was blown away. I have *never* been treated so poorly at a restaurant - let alone a restaurant that I've been to many times. 

What is hard, though, is the food is still good. So, I'll probably return - but I'll call my order in ahead of time for pick up and go eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Most of the dishes are servicable, but some are below average. Had the lamb vinadaloo, which is quite good. The goat curry is a little gamey, so not for everyone (if you haven't had goat before, otherwise it was okay). The chili paneer tasted like something you would get an americanized chinese restaurant. If that is what you are going for, you should get this. 

Never ate there, but the staff is always friendly for take-out. Parking is a bit of a nuisance, and usually park at the mexican restaurant in the back."}
{"text":"The food is def 5 stars! I love everything that they have in the buffet. It's all really fresh and flavorful, and they always have a nice variety of dishes available. The price (~$10) for their lunch buffet is pretty reasonable considering the fact that they have a lot of meat dishes. So why do I give 1 star? The service is a disaster.

In the afternoons, almost everyone in the restaurant is getting the buffet, so it's important that there are plates, silverware, etc for people to use when they go to the buffet. Last time I went it was a Sunday afternoon at lunchtime and the place was pretty crowded. There were no plates, bowls, silverware, or anything at the buffet, so no one could get any food. Also, none of the diners were getting refills on their water (which is very bad when all the food is spicy).  And all this was going on for about 20 minutes, and the guy who sits behind the counter and is responsible for taking care of the customers was just sitting there and not doing anything about it. 

But wait, it gets worse. So a customer comes in the restaurant and realizes that there are no plates or anything so he can't serve himself at the buffet. However, there were some styrofoam to-go containers that were sitting by the buffet that are meant to be used by customers getting carry-out. So this customer is hungry and decides to use the styrofoam containers to get his food. So the owner comes out from behind the desk and starts yelling at this customer and making a HUGE scene in front of everyone in the restaurant. Like seriously? The customer was just trying to eat. If you don't want him to use those containers, then BRING OUT SOME PLATES!! That was just so rude and unprofessional in my opinion. Don't yell at a customer for your mistakes!

Anyway, this place has great food. But when you're sitting for 20 minutes not eating because there are no plates at the buffet and you don't have any water, you kinda forget how good the food is. This place needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian food!  Very reasonable prices and good portions.  Had garlic naan, vegetable samosas, malai kofta, and aloo gobi.  Everything was delicious!  The malai kofta was probably the best I've had anywhere.  The aloo gobi was more flavorful that other places I've had it.  The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting.  Definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"It used to be nice m, but not anymore. Did they change the chef? Not sure.  But I hope they will get back to their original state"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon, well after the rush, and there were tables open.  The food was plentiful and DELICIOUS!   While initially it seemed a bit difficult for the waiter and the chef to understand my questions about \"gluten free\" aka no wheat flour, the chef finally got it and was most helpful with what I could and could not eat.   There were so many things that were okay for me, and as a Celiac I do appreciate not going home with a bloated belly, unless it's from eating two huge helpings!"}
{"text":"After seeing an exhibit at CMA, a friend and I were starved and in the mood for Indian food. This unassuming spot was closest, so we decided to check it out. I am sad I hadn't stopped in before on one of the many times I have gone past on my way to Coquette! 

Though not much in the way of decor, the food more than made up for it. We both got tika masala dishes and they were well made and really hit the spot. There was more than enough to fill us up, with some to take home too. The service was also excellent. 

I will be back to this spot when on the east side again!"}
{"text":"This place has a pretty extensive menu and the prices are fair. Not the cheapest, but cheaper than some of the Indian places I have been to. Most of the entrees are about $8.99 to 13.99. It has more of an impersonal feel to it - scanty on the decorations, but does have a big screen playing Indian TV and music, so that makes up for it. The restaurant is a little hard to find though; I drove right past it twice, even though I had the address written down and was meeting a friend there. We ordered the lamb rogan josh and the eggplant. It was just the right spiciness and yummy. The naan and papad were good too. I would definitely go back - good sized portions, reasonable prices, and good Indian food!"}
{"text":"I really like the food here-UCircle has some excellent choices for world cuisine these days. I recently had takeout (Chicken Karahi with naan) and it was delicious and well heated. Only dislike is that the price ($12.99) is a bit steep. Have gone here to dine in and had consistently great food-the service is hit or miss like others have mentioned."}
{"text":"I've had only good experiences here.  Their curries, chicken tikki marsala, and shrimp are all very good.  My favorites here are the samosas and tandori chicken.  Nothing but sheer tastefulness =).  Prices can be a little high, but come here on a weekday night and you can use a restaurant.com coupon.  I've also been here for their lunch buffet and it was decent and cheap.

Just a word of caution though, make sure you don't wear expensive clothes here because you are going to have to pay a little more for some dry cleaning.  The aromas from their cooking spices will follow your jacket around for days.  Perhaps it is just the restaurant's way of reminding you to come back soon =)."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is your best bet.  Otherwise, each entree rather expensive.  Provided that you attend the lunch buffet, self control is imperative.  However, if this is unavoidable, be sure to wear trousers that are loose, although garments with an elastic waist band, such as sweat pants, would suffice.  Leggings are not really pants. 

I've been coming here for close to 6 years now and have recently introduced boyfriend to the mango lassis. They're not really authentic (according to my Indian friends - I don't really have any authority on this) but super good."}
{"text":"Favorite indian spots in america are Cincinnati and San Francisco. But this place gives all my favorite spots in both cities a run for the gold . THIS PLACE ROCKS SO HARD! So spicy mon ! So spicy!"}
{"text":"Serves previous day food for buffet. Chef's not a Authentic Cook . Uses the same gravy for all the food and People who work there are horrible. Never ask for delivery. Sometimes they say chargeable $5 or place min order $25 or free. It's not Worth eating there."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant in the cleveland  area! Festive and colorful decor and outstanding food ! Flakey naan and flavorful sauces . Spiced and delicate rice!"}
{"text":"Ive been ordering from Indian Flame for quite some time now. Its just that I have learned what to order and what works well. I am vegetarian so will stick to reviewing that part. The fare is pretty much slightly above ordinary so thats why the 3 stars. 

They are really good with anything Paneer; Malai Kofta and Chana. Most Naans. Avoid Daals for sure, and any other dishes like Aloo Gobi etc, and you will be fine. 

Always ask for Medium spicy even if you can tolerate a lot more. Cause if you ask for max spicy then you feel the food is full of those artificial flavoring (that thing you call Soda in India, I think its baking soda, not sure) but its not good.

The appetizers and lassi are decent. 

So learn what to order and Indian Flame wont disappoint."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet was affordable and delicious, I loved everything they put out, will totally go back!"}
{"text":"I wished I had read the review on the briyani before I ordered it!  It was one of the more expensive vegetarian options on the menu, and it was the worst I have ever had, 
I ordered the briyani because the menu listed the following ingredients \"bell peppers, onions, carrots, cauliflower, chick peas, raisins, cashews and almonds\".  What they served was a rice with a red sauce and frozen vegetables (peas, carrots, corn, green beans) and onions. When I asked about the ingredients swap, they said they \"we removed them because people have allergies\".   I refused to pay for the \"briyani\", and they took it off of my bill. 

The service was very slow and some of the food was not thermally hot (or flavorful). We were 5 people and the staff inadvertently sent one of our meals out with a pick-up order.  The 5th person in our group did not get served until we were almost done with our meal.  At least the waitress finally told us why it was taking so long!

Loved the spicy vegetarian samosa.  The spicy okra dish was yummy too."}
{"text":"This place is new to the University Circle/Case Western area. I think it's a perfect addition to the campus. When I went with my staff team for dinner here, I kept seeing students come in and out whether to sit down for dinner or to grab to-go orders. 

Food: Mmmmm. The entire night, my friend Dave kept exclaiming \"I am so happy I live in Cleveland now. Seriously, I am so happy I live in Cleveland.\" We ordered naan, which was freshly baked and really good. We also ordered goat curry (really good), Palak Paneer, and Chicken Korma. They were all good, but the goat curry definitely stood out. Like others have said, the meat fell right off the bone. My friends' 2 year old loves lentils, so he had the lentil & chickpea dish. 

We asked for medium/mild spice since we were with a diverse crowd of people. Turns out we could have gone with more spice. Also, most dishes are between $8.99-$13.99 with the exception of some seafood dishes.

Atmosphere: Overall it was a very enjoyable dining experience. I don't care much for decor, especially if the food is good... hole in the wall = hole in the wall. The service was a little on the slow side since we had a big party, but once we had our food in front of us, we were very happy people. I would definitely come again - $8.99 all you can eat lunch buffets and FREE DELIVERY!"}
{"text":"Just called for delivery service.  They apparently claim to deliver however, 15 minutes away is too FAR to travel.  How ridiculous is that?  Not much you can say for food that you can't even eat.  But poor service.  Wow.  How the hell is a 15 minute drive too far to deliver?  Disappointed is not the word.  Clearly the quick tip for this place is not to order delivery because they really don't deliver."}
{"text":"I only go to this place when I am in Case area, their food is delicious and very authentic.. However, the place is not clean and very outdated and the staff are not friendly"}
{"text":"I love coming here after class for their lunch buffet! Although the restaurant is quite small, they have a fairly decent selection of lunch buffet items, ranging from chicken tikki massala, naan, palak paneer, rice pudding, salad, etc.  

Since the restaurant is so small, it's often difficult to find a seat. I recommend coming before noon to beat the lunch hour madness!"}
{"text":"First and last impression... I called to place an order and was told there's a $5 delivery charge. When I stated that I thought they had no delivery charge, the individual on the other side stammered \" It's a busy weekend for us\" and a discussion began in the background between him and another individual. I simply asked for my order to be canceled and hung up. They tried to call back but I chose to decline their call.... Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"This is going to be short and sweet. 

The food is decent. I'd eat it again if someone got take-out for me. Nothing to gush about. 

But.... much like every other Indian joint in CLE -- the service sucked. Sucked. Sucked. I've had worse. But still, it sucked."}
{"text":"Took me a bit of driving around to find the place, even with two different navigation devices... it's not me, I swear. The place is hard to spot, located next to a bar and some other restaurant, it doesn't even have a legit sign, just a banner. 
Note: it's right across from Cleveland Institute of Art. 

Aside from all of that, the food was decent. I ordered the following: full order of Tandoori Chicken, Goat Curry, Chili Chicken, Palak Paneer, and 3 Naan. Well, actually, I ended up getting (and paying for) two goat curry dishes, since they screwed up the order somehow even though \"ek\" sounds nothing like \"do\".

The goat curry was the best out of the meat dishes. Right amount of spice and flavor and the meat fell off the bones, literally, I found them separated in the container. The tandoori chicken had a good taste but was way too dry for my liking, and the extras (typically saut√©ed onions and green peppers) were a jumbled mess inside the container. Also, it had a orangish tint to it which kinda freaked me out since I've never had tandoori chicken that wasn't crimson red. The naan were good, but it's kinda hard to screw up pre-made frozen naan.

Now the chili chicken.... AVOID. Unless you want typical American-Chinese restaurant chunks of fried chicken just smothered in Sriracha sauce and crushed red peppers avoid this $13 plate. Seriously, it looked and tasted like the sesame chicken I order from Chinese restaurants, except a lot more spicy. 

Overall I was pleasantly surprised, I'm extremely picky when it comes to Indian food, I've been a bit spoiled with being Indian and all, but I can see myself getting food from here again... and by food I mean goat curry and probably nothing else.

I also want to add that the place is a bit on the expensive side with each dish averaging around $13 (us Indians are known to be cheap), but once again this may have to do with me being spoiled by $3.99 chicken biryani on Devon Ave. in Chicago.


Bottom line: All rants aside, it's a good place to go get some Indian food as along as you avoid the Chili Chicken."}
{"text":"This is a great place which reminds you good north Indian Punjabi food...

I have never been to the buffet (as such I am not a fan of buffets in general).... 

Good Chats and Chai!"}
{"text":"Not bad; lunch buffet. Would come back if in the area and craving Indian for lunch. Not an attractive place for a nice meal out."}
{"text":"Not being a local, we came here based on restaurants.com as referenced by other reviews, the yelp reviews, and to save a buck.

We ordered a chicken masala and I had the fish goen (sp?) and they were both very good along with our 2 orders of naan.  Their chef did an amazing job.

We also ordered the mango milkshake and the mango lassi(sp?) and both were decent.  I prefered the milkshake over the lassi which has a much stronger taste.  What was weird was that they brought these drinks after our meal was finished.

My only complaint about this place was that the service really slow..  Our waitress really looked confused half the time she interacted with us, but I guess she got our order correct.

Overall, I'd come here again and try out other foods."}
{"text":"I really liked the food.. Delicious and serves hot.. Quality was good.. Buffet price was reasonable.. Definitely will come back again... Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Our server was nice and helpful. The goat curry, samosa, and masala tea were very good."}
{"text":"Really good food that is closer to authentic than most Indian restaurants. This place is a hole in the wall in the Cleveland Heights area, but it has an extensive menu with traditional North Indian staples as well as a good selection of Indian street food items, which are not always found at other restaurants. The dishes are slightly overpriced, but the taste and portion sizes make up for it. I had the chicken korma and chicken tikka masala, both which tasted fresh, distinctive, and had the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"Great little place with really good Indian food.

From all the reviews and comments on the decor (or lack there of), I expected some kind of stark white, institutional-type feel to this place. Not so! It's actually quite quaint inside. I disagree with one of the posts that you can't take a date here. Sure you can! I totally dig the cheesy asian velvet paintings.

I didn't opt for the lunch buffet, although it looked pretty decent...containing fairly common dishes. And for $8.99, it's reasonable as well. They have a pretty expansive menu, including goat dishes (hmm, never had goat...). I ended up getting the Lamb Vindaloo with some Naan to go. The lamb was very good although I would have liked it hotter. It seems a lot of Indian restaurants don't believe you when you say you like it HOT. I'll have to be more persistent next time ;) The naan was excellent, perfectly cooked and chewy. Oh, and thankfully, the entrees include rice (a rarity). 

As I waited for my takeout, I was offered water...a nice touch and well appreciated. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"best bang for the buck in the area (even more than Chipotle)!

Hungry? Come for the $9 lunch buffet before 3PM and you will have one of the most authentic and tastiest lunches in the area

-I recommend getting \"naan\" (indian flatbread), which is brought to the table fresh from the kitchen throughout lunch. 
-Their chicken tandoori is delicious, full of flavor.
-Palak Paneer (cheese cubes bathed in saut√©ed spinach)
-Their rice pudding!!!!!!! (I seriously sometimes go just to get their rice pudding! It is hidden away near the front with the other condiments)

But if you are there for lunch, you should really try a little bit of everything. I once even had goat meat at this place! Indian Flame is authentic for sure (confirmed by an indian friend of mine)

The reason for 4/5 is because when I ordered tandoori chicken to go one night, it was incredibly dry, no matter how much sauce I put on, it was just nowhere near the quality of their lunchtime chicken (probably cooked way in advance and reheated, causing it to dry out)

Service- There used to be this big overly-proud man who worked there who was a dick and frankly, doesn't belong in the restaurant business. Long story short, he got 2 of our 4 orders completely wrong, stood awkwardly at the table for 2 full min refusing to bring back the right order, made a scene, blamed it on us. That was 2 years ago, and I have not seen him in recent visits. The lady who works the cashier now is SUPER nice, always thanking us for even the smallest things, and so is the skinnier gentleman who is often there.

Overall, I highly recommend this place for lunch. As for dinner, sit-in or take-out you are taking a chance. That rice pudding though...

{"text":"Great great customer service. Food is delicious. Feel like I am India right now. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Very solid Indian food! This place opened while I was an ungrad at Case. Since then, I've been going here for Indian food. The food is always a hit, but service is a hit or miss (but I'd say they are getting better with service). 

Anyhow, if you're here, you should definitely get a side of naan. Their garlic naan is delicious, they are all made in house in a clay tandoor oven. I was told their secret to their naan is the yogurt sauce. The yogurt sauce is made in house and is used to make naan and sauces. My favorite dish there is their chicken masala. The chicken is lightly battered and fried. The chicken is then smothered in chili sauce that is some what spicy (you can pick the spiciness) with a bit of sweetness. It's served with basmati (long grain) rice. A few pieces of chicken and sauce is enough for me to clear the plate of rice! It also tastes great with naan. 

They also have a lunch buffet that serves a few meat dishes along with rice and naan. I haven't tired this myself, but I was told it is quite good and worth the money.

Tip: this place takes restaurant.com certificates, so if you want to save some $, buy one before going to the restaurant. But beware of the restrictions!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've gone several times and I've never been disappointed. I think the goat curry is the stand-out of their menu. The lamb curry and their hot crispy on top naan are honorable mentions. They also have lots of veggie options.

It's a casual place and they serve a deadly for your diet buffet during lunch. I think the dinner offerings are better than the buffet, however, so would recommend that."}
{"text":"Absolutely love it! Their food is great quality, and probably the best Indian food I've ever had."}
{"text":"If you live or work in the heights area this needs to be part of your rotation. The mango lassi and mango milkshake are the best I've had.  Same goes for the samosas and the pakora.  I want to put the green chutney on everything I eat anywhere.  And the meat is always cooked phenomenally.
 
You get the impression many of the curries are made from a similar base.  Saffron Patch and India Garden in the greater Cleveland area have more complex/interesting spices.  But I am only speaking relatively, it is still Indian food, the flavours are still phenomenal.  For me the curry is a little bit too salty/buttery, and it usually feels unhealthy, but I believe this is normal for Indian food.  

When it comes to the immediate-area competition sadly Chutney Rolls has closed.  Worse yet Cafe Tandoor charges for rice, which is just surreal. 

The service can be a bit impersonal, overwhelmed, and confused, but that's also super typical of Indian restaurants.  I believe the stories I read on here.  But I've never experienced them being rude and the accidents have never been catastrophes.  I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Loved the food.. especially their dal, chicken karahi and garlic naan. I definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Went to the buffet on a Sunday in May. Not great, not bad."}
{"text":"Where most $10 all u can eat places are essentially serving slop, yelpers were spot on with this gem. Dropped in for a quick lunch down street from U hospital.  Everything was fresh and seasoned perfectly. 

Only down vote is parking.  Not much around on street during lunch rush."}
{"text":"Good food. I woulda gave it a 4 but it took 1 1/2 hr to be delivered!"}
{"text":"I don't care how good the food is, but this place have the worst Service ever. Don't waste your time going there."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Indian restaurant. I don't have any complaints for the dinner food, it is mighty delicious. As for the lunch buffet, I can tell the curry is not as thick as the dinner ones. Still very good but just a tad plain since they added a bit more water. If I am only judging on the food I would give them a 4 star but the service was really not great which is why I took a star off.

I've never had a pleasant experience with the wait staff there. Like all the other review said, they hardly check on you. Sometimes you have to seat yourself and then wait for another 10min for someone who looks like they work there to come over and give you the menu. On average, none of the staff seem rude or nice, they just look...BLAH. It really does bring down the experience. It feels more like a cafeteria than a sit down restaurant. 

Hopefully they read these yelp reviews and do something about their attitude!"}
{"text":"K, so the food rules, but if you go during lunch expect to feel rushed. I just was at Indian Flame during prime noon - 1 pm lunchtime and patrons awaiting a table were staring me down waiting for me to get up so they could take over. It felt especially awkward when I got up for plate #2 (don't judge me, it's a buffet...) and a couple started swooping in on my table before noticing I wasn't getting up to pay, rather to fill my plate. Minus one star for not enough tables creating unnecessary awkwardness."}
{"text":"I hope the quality of the food at this place has not decreased. I no longer live in Cleveland, yet I still crave the Indian food at Indian flame. My favorite is the mahli kofta. For a meat dish I've heard the lamb curry/vindaloo are amazing! Although this place is a hole in the wall and not exactly sanitary, it is still my favorite Indian place in all of Ohio,  saffron patch in Shaker Heights would come in a close second"}
{"text":"The food is great, come here all the time, especially for the lunch buffet! The samosas are AMAZING, don't leave without one!!! The chicken tikka masala is a popular standard, but the paneer here is really good too. Also, great garlic naan. 

This place is a bit on the pricier side, but the portions are fairly large. The buffet is a great deal!

The service can be a bit slow, and I have had issues with catering orders being individual portions and not trays of food, but the actual food is really great."}
{"text":"I love Indians food. And I'd like to think I'm a pretty legit Indian food critic. In college, all my friends were Indian & since then, I've ate plenty of Indian restaurants. If I had to rank Cleveland's Indian restaurants, it would be: Saffron Patch,  Indian Flame, Taj Mahal, Cafe Tandoor. 

Indian Flame makes really great garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, and butter fish. Just order those 3 dishes, and you will be giving this restaurant a 4 star minimum.

However, their Paleek Paneer & Alu Gobi aren't quick as good."}
{"text":"1ST thing my review is based off the sunday buffet. 2ND thing I did not eat till I hated myself.
THE buffet did not have many items but what they had was good. They definitely make the food for gringos as there was little to no spicyness. 
The paneer was  good albeit  a little sweet. Theybhad some spinich with lentles and potatoes, had good flavor with cumin being the most pervasive. 
The butter chicken and curry chicken we're very tastly and did not seem overly greasy.
I did not feel like I ate baking soda. If you are wondering what that means, my Indian friends tell me that some Indian restaurants that serve buffets  add a little baking soda that you fill up faster.
The chicken briyani was excellent and seasoned as it should minus the heat.  There we're other dishes but I did not partake. 
Service was attentive, my water glass was never empty. Well worth 10$ coupled with instant gratification. Thank you please come again."}
{"text":"This is a nice place by Case Western campus. It was really empty on this Monday dinner time. However, I'm not sure classes have started yet.

The food was decent. I had palak paneer (paneer cubes in blended spinach and garlic) and Alu Gobi. I was expecting a vegetable mixture of green peppers, broccoli, etc. It was literally potatoes and cauliflower. Apparently, I was completely wrong. Who knew.

The samosas were wonderful. Fried crisp pockets of blended potatoes and peas.

The naan was liberally coated with oil - the perfect accompaniment to our sauces. Yum 

The other patrons were South Indian and Middle Eastern. Not sure what that means."}
{"text":"Fast service and a very reasonable menu.  The service was very good which made my ordering issue a nonissue."}
{"text":"Indian flame delivers to UH which makes it great for UH employees wanting Indian food.  The aloo gobi, chicken tikka masala, naan and paneer tikka masala are all good but probably about average for indian food in cleveland.  Their lunch buffet is very affordable and often serves the classics.  The food is pretty mild so its a good place for people new to indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Average Indian food at best. I've only gotten delivery and take out so can't comment on the service. The restaurant itself looks a little run down. The food is fine - I tend to stick to the chicken makhani or tikka masala. Overall I prefer Tadka or Saffron Patch for Indian food but this place is close and convenient."}
{"text":"I come here often for the lunch buffet (11a-3p) and dinner (no buffet) with my buds. Lunch buffet is ~$10 per person and dinner depends on the order.

It is a very delicious restaurant with a lot of various options for appetizers and entrees.
I enjoy the chicken korma, butter chicken, and mango chicken with garlic naan.

I recommend people to stop by and try this place out."}
{"text":"The food was ok, and prices were cheap, but the service was poor.

I ate there on Saturday night. There was no buffet (I don't know when they have the buffet). We ordered from the menu. The food was ok but not exceptional. I liked the onion naan.

When we entered the restaurant, the large guy with a large head pointed to a table (without saying a word). But the booth he pointed us at had a bag on the seat and stuff someone's belongings on the table, so he picked those up after we sat down. Don't expect manners or any politeness at this place; they want to take your order, bring your food, get your money, and get you out the door. Their restroom looks like it's barely been cleaned, this year. The art on their walls is tackier than usual, among Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"Lamb korma is the best!! 

Great service!

Great people. 

Consistent.

Good quality.

Underrated. 

Price could be lower or maybe increase quantity.

Still very good!"}
{"text":"Having recently started eating Indian food am
Glad I found this little spot on Euclid. I've had the chance to sample food at other Indian restaurants and cannot compare to how great this stuff is.  Love the chicken vindaloo and vegetable samosa."}
{"text":"Service? What service? There is no service!

This is a cafeteria with self serve food. The food is above average which is why I return. The lunch buffet it good and it is close to the Cleveland Clinic for a fast lunch. A couple of weeks ago I went at 1pm and there was no food left and despite people continuing to come in, there was little attempts to replenish it. 

I did not want to return but once again because the food is decent and I figured if I went at noon there would be food at least. One person working behind the counter waved to a table as we walked in then disappeared in the kitchen during most of our visit. Other guests in the restaurant has to knock on the kitchen door for him to come out and cash them out. He wanted until more guests arrive to clear the dirty tables, and didn't bring us any water until after we started eating. This btw was the only 'service' we received, aside from waiting for him to again emerge from the kitchen to check out, in which he left before I finished signing the check.

The restaurant in general is dirty, and we had to go through multiple plates before we found a clean one for the buffet. It is a hole in the wall so I take it for what it is, but I've never experienced a place where they people working there just didn't care. Maybe it would be ok it you ordered take out and just judged the food, but despite how the flavor may be, I can't imagine the quality that goes into the food is going to be much different than the effort displayed in the rest of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Pleas avoid this place like a plague! It's one of the worst experience for me service wise. I found couple of eye lashes in my food. Their philosophy is that if it is a buffet they won't take plates off the table or serve water... I wish i was not rating the place because its not worth rating"}
{"text":"I liked the place. It was your typical curry joint. Not very fancy, sort of dumpy. The kebab appetizer was real good. The chicken korma was excellent and the shrimp masala was spicy but not too crazy hot. Made you sweat in a good way. The onion naan and the rice was also fine and we washed it all down with these mango smoothie drinks which were perfect. I'd go again."}
{"text":"I am not going to rate the delivery service - it was a disaster, took a long time - I felt bad for the girl because clearly they did not outfit her with google maps.  I think if they improve the delivery, this place could probably do really well.

The food was really good.  Ordered Chicken Vindaloo, Butter Chicken, Aloo Gobi, Garlic Naan, and Rice - it was about 40 bucks.  Portions were reasonable too.  

I will definitely order again, however I will probably either pickup or call at least and hour or so in advance."}
{"text":"The way I think of Indian Flame is this: in America, we've got our local pizzerias and fast food places where we can pop in, grab our normal, unspectacular, but reliable meals. Well, pretend for a second we are in India (and they have tje same proclivity for fast food)...Indian Flame would be your destination. It isn't trying to hide anything or be more than it really is. Rather, it's a \"hey...I'm making Indian food, want some?\" approach. 

You aren't coming here for a date or to spend excess amount of time. Rather, if you have a tooth for Indian and don't want to make a big deal of the situation, you know you can count on what this restaurant provides: food, not a dining experience.

The decor is decent, though you might find yourself staring at the bright paint colors for a while, but if you're like me, you probably won't mind.

Dinner menu is larger than you'd think, given the cafeteria feel to the place and the small number of tables.  You really can't beat the lunch buffet price (though, you can probably easily beat the selection and quality...on the salty side too)!

The one downside to the \"hey we're making Indian food, want any\" approach is that the service leaves much to be desired: your drink will not be refilled unless you call a server over to help.

This is about as far east as you'll want to be on Euclid...some shady things went down the first time I was there."}
{"text":"I hadn't had Indian food since moving to Ohio. Their food was pretty good. It wasn't fall on the floor, like to plate, and order more just to have it in the fridge kind of good. But it was tasty. Quantity wise, one order is more than enough for two people! Maybe this is why their dinner prices are a little overpriced. But, I have heard that the lunch buffet is worthwhile. 

If you're CWRU student: they accept Case Cash

The resturant itself is on the edge of campus, a little \"hole in the wall ish\". The people weren't really warm and welcoming but weren't rude either. Just business like and done. 

If you're craving Indian and nearby, it's worth the take-out."}
{"text":"A weird lunch experience.

I came here for a late lunch with a friend and we simply strolled right on in, picked up a couple plates and started eating without so much as a single employee acknowledging our existence. To be fair, a server poured us water ~ 3 min before we got up to pay. If you're looking to scratch dine-and-dash off your bucket list, this is the place to do it. But don't, because that's a dick move.

The food was tasty but a bit old/stale after the noontime rush. The peas and paneer dish with naan was my personal favorite. As for atmosphere, the inside is a bit dreary but the velvet paintings are nice to glance at if you're into wall decorations. There's only one booth that could accommodate a party greater than 4 - 5 people so seating is better suited for smaller groups.

The buffer is a good deal (~ $10) for satisfying an Indian food craving, but I couldn't help but wish I'd spent a few dollars less at the Chipotle across the street."}
{"text":"Ah yes, Indian Flame. The one Indian restaurant within reasonable distance of University Circle. Often overlooked since it's located past E. 115th St., but it's a fairly great local eatery with two distinct service personalities: the lunch buffet, and √† la carte offerings.

The lunch buffet is a real gem. $9 pay to play, and you can eat as much as you want from noon to 3PM. Tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, and mango pickles with some naan is all I need to get by for the rest of the day, and it's all wonderful.

The √† la carte offerings are varied and all great, but I feel like they hold back on the spice if you don't look like you can handle it. I consistently ask for Indian spicy for most of the things that I order, and it's usually? Ohio spicy, at best. Other than that, it's delicious. Some of the highlights include chicken tikka malai, and the mango curry.

The lunch buffet is worth coming for. Bring your friends."}
{"text":"Overview: Indian Flame is a traditional, non-vegetarian, Indian restaurant that serves (and even delivers) absolutely delicious Indian food, but is also fairly overpriced.

The Food: I ordered an order of naan, the goat curry, and the chicken tika masala ($~32 not including tip delivered). Both were ordered \"medium\" spicy. I thought the goat curry was wonderfully tender and very, very flavorful though I was a little bit sad that bones were left on because it slowed down my eating. The chicken was still good, but a bit more dry than the goat. Both curries were flavored similarly and looked the same shade of orange.

For sides, I had the standard white rice which was perfect. I so ordered an order of naan but found that eating it all together was a bit TOO flavorful (perhaps a bit too salty?).

The Establishment: I ordered delivery so I cannot comment on this.

Service: The person that took my order over the phone had a fairly thick Indian accent but we managed to finish the order without too many hiccups. It took ~30 minutes to prepare and deliver it to the Glidden House on a weekday night (8:30PM). The deliveryman stayed in the car. They DO take credit card over the phone.

Overall: Indian Flame makes some pretty good curries, but for the price, I just don't think I can give it a strong recommendation, especially when there are so many more good restaurants springing up in Cleveland."}
{"text":"YUM! Best Indian buffet in Cleveland.  $8.99 from 11 am to 3 pm.  Today it was packed despite the freezing weather, and there was good reason why!  The food is delicious, with very good portions of meat to sauce/veggie in their meat dishes.  They have the standard type fare you will see at Indian buffets (korma, dal), plus a few extra dishes you don't find often (goat curry).  Naan is fresh and hot, with the right amount of crisp on the outside and softness on the inside.  

Oh and the gulab jamun..... mmm the best gulab jamun I've ever had!  very soft, and not sickeningly sweet at all.  my husband usually hates this dish, but he absolutely loved it when he tried it here.  I will definitely be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Not terribly impressed with the food at this restaurant.  I have eaten the lunch buffet a few times and feel that the flavors in the vegetable korma and chana masala are not as rich as they should be.  The spice level is not very high.  The naan that is served on the buffet also does not seem as fresh as it should be.

I always tip at buffets, but when I was paying this time I questioned why I should be tipping.  We were given a pitcher so we could refill our own water.  In addition, during the entire course of the meal no one came to take away my plates.  I had to stack them on the side of the table on my own.

To give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt, I also ordered an entree off the menu, as the food on the buffet is never as good as something served straight from the kitchen.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala, and while it was okay, it was nothing special.  Again, the flavors didn't seem as rich as I've had at other restaurants.  Also, when I got back to my office to eat my lunch, I realized they neglected to give me a fork and a napkin in the bag they stapled shut.  I had to go back out to another restaurant to get myself a fork.  Not happy."}
{"text":"I frequent this place quite a bit for lunch buffets and ala carte dinners - and it's always busy which is good! I always end up getting their vegetable kurma dish with tawa roti, which is absolutely fantastic. The restaurant is casual dining and what's sets it apart is the friendly customer service, beautiful traditional Indian paintings and the delicious food (Punjabi style). The portion size is large - I always end up taking home half the food. My coworkers prefer this place over Bombay chaat (which is also very good) for lunch buffets. Can't beat the price, food and quantity!"}
{"text":"Very good malai kofta and naan! I think this is good quality and tasty Indian food in a hole in the wall sort of place. I'm interested in trying their lunch buffet. The restaurant isn't as nice as it could be but who really cares when the food is good! The wait time for food is pretty long when you call in an order but I don't mind that because it makes me believe the food is extremely fresh!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for lunch with my coworkers and enjoyed their buffet. It was a phenomenal experience. The atmosphere, and service were top notch, and the food was even better. While eating the owner brought fresh naan straight to the table from the kitchen while we were eating our meal as well. Do yourself a favor and stop by for a great meal."}
{"text":"I am sorry to say that the people who have written awesome reviews for this place have probably never eaten good Indian food before. Food coma is what you get after a large satiating meal, and FOOD TRAUMA is what I would call our experience of eating here. Karahi Chicken wasn't anything like I have ever eaten before: more like slushy tomato paste with few pieces of boiled chicken and mustard seeds thrown in together. Naan was burnt and soggy, seemed like they had thrown frozen pieces from the grocery store into the oven. Tandoori chicken was burnt with a bitter taste. Masala Chai was probably the only saving grace. And to top this, our bill came to 40$ for 2 people for the worst Indian food I have ever eaten in the last 6 years in the US! This place should be reported to the local authorities for being such a disgrace to Indian food."}
{"text":"As the only traditional Indian restaurant on Case Western's campus I really do want to like this place and I keep going back even though it's not the most inviting atmosphere, and the service is pretty slow and inconsistent depending on who is working that day. 
I pretty much always order the same thing at North Indian places- paneer tikka masala, rice, and garlic naan, and while Indian Flames service brings down its rating, the food has been consistently good. It's not completely authentic, but it still tastes great-- I love the thick, creamy, tomato based tikka masala and the garlic naan's have always been on point! It also doesn't hurt that the portions are huge and its always a meal and a half..
All in all, the food and sheer convenience of this place makes it worth going back for, but I'd recommend carry out if you have the option."}
{"text":"For all those Indians out there living away from their families that get midnight cravings for home cooked chapatis, aloo, and paneer.....you will be disappointed by this restaurant. While it does temporarily satiate any Indian food craving, the food is not stand out fine Indian cuisine. The restaurants itself is very small and the service can be slow at times. 

Just like many Indian restaurants in big cities, the dishes are expensive making the lunch buffet the only truly good deal. However, that is not to say that you can't still have an enjoyable meal. While many of the dishes are overly oily and excessively spiced (like many other Indian restaurants that leave you with indigestion), there is one dish that I consistently find to be pretty darn good. That would be the Goan Fish Curry. I'll admit I have not had this dish in many other restaurants, so I can't make a great comparison. However, it has become one of my favorite dishes and a go-to choice for Indian Flame take-out. 

Overall, since Indian Flame is so nearby with pretty efficient delivery, I'll probably continue to be a devoted customer."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food, actually. My boyfriend and I keep meaning to get back here, but between the parking and getting downtown, we can't seem to manage. Eventually, though!"}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite Indian in the area. I would highly recommend the lunch buffet. They change up most of the options in the buffet line daily. They have a homestyle Northern flavors. I wish some of the dishes were hotter, but you can specify the level of heat when you order from the menu. Parking is tricky, but you can sometimes luck out on side streets."}
{"text":"The restaurant serves average Indian food and can be visited if someone is in that area... the desserts are good though.. most of the curries have similar gravies and appetizers come loaded with onions which I think is not needed... our chicken appetizer had more onions than chicken in it... 
if you want really hot food, tell them to make it extra extra spicy else it'll be bland... 
The ambience is on a lower side and the place feels cramped.... 
overall, it is worth giving a try if you are in the area..."}
{"text":"We just ate here and it was fantastic!  A hidden gem in Cleveland that we will definitely be frequenting. The wait staff was helpful, fast and courteous. It's really affordable and the flavors in each dish were spot on!"}
{"text":"Paneer tikka appetiser was v disappointing. Onions still raw. Chicken saag was good and in decent quantity. Rice was good and in decent quantity. naan was of a decent quality. Interior is good, seating could've been better."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Indian flame. I think it's pretty authentic (not that I've had a ton of experience with authentic Indian food). Go for the lunch buffet, there's plenty of different dishes. You can also do lunch takeout, for a dollar cheaper than lunch buffet you can fill a takeout box and they give you fresh naan on the side."}
{"text":"It's a disgrace to Indian food. No Parking facility. Room is not warm inside. Ask for a glass of warm water and you get cold water no matter how many times you tell. Gravy is same for all curry, which is ground peanut/ badam and all colored red too. No option to give -ve Star.
           I called before going to dinner for the Parking options as I was concerned about the parking place and the guy told that they have space behind the building. Actually only 5-6 cars fit there and which is not there parking spot. Though parking was full, there was not a single customer inside. It took me few rounds and finally ended  up parking on Metered lot on the other side of the road. 
         I asked the server to suggest me his best dish so as to make me visit again. As per his suggestion I took Chicken Kurma and Malai kofta. I never  had  such a bad tasting both dishes. And you cant make a difference among both curries except that one had chicken and other had Veg kofta dipped in same gravy. Forget about Malai in Malai Kofta. 
          Finally, i got a bad stomach and gad and my room wad stinking at night. 

WILL NEVER EVER GO THERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"Service is ok. But food can improve a lot. Maybe, my Indian taste buds demand higher standards."}
{"text":"Some friends wanted to go get some Indian food, so off I went to what they called \"the Indian restaurant across from the Cleveland Institute of Art.\"

But seriously, it was across from it! I parked across the street in a side street (due to my lack of parallel parking skills), and ventured in.

We were seated pretty quickly (had a table of 9 ppl), and ordered. We got the goat curry, some type of paneer, butter fish, chicken tikal marsala..and some other beef dish. All were GOOD.

The butter fish was by far my favorite. The dishes came out fast and plentiful. My friend even ordered the ice cream at the end, and that was delicious as well. 

I'm no Indian food expert, but I definitely liked the food here..."}
{"text":"So here I came back again for their lunch buffet, which is only $10 per person. The food was pretty good I have to say, but when I got there, most of the meat dishes were gone. I felt bad asking for more but another group of people came in after me and they asked the waitress to cook more, so we got lucky and got to eat some freshly cooked meat dishes. I really liked their tandoori chicken - it was not dry at all and it was very very flavorful. I also liked their potato yellow ish vege dish - i don't know what that's called but it was very yummy as well. The rice pudding was decent too.

so, if you walk in and found out that most of the stuff were gone, don't be afraid to ask them to bring up some fresh ones. Chances are if you don't ask them, you dont get to eat anything.."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday night for dinner with a friend.  We sat ourself at a dirty booth before realizing we wouldn't be able to reach the table with the amount of space between it and the bench.  We then walked towards the only other available booth which had a remote control and a glass of water on it.  When we asked it we could sit here, the server's response was, \"I don't see why not\".  I felt like we were imposing on their evening.  Thankfully, the rest of the meal was all uphill from here.  

 I had a $25 gift certificate from Restaurant.com so we splurged.  We ordered the vegetable samosa and samosa chaat as appetizers.  Both were very good, although I preferred the chaat as it is more of an 'open' samosa with fresh ingredients (potatoes, chickpeas, and fresh herbs) pouring out.   

For the meal, We ordered three dishes to share, each priced at $10.99.  We got a Palaak Paneer, Chicken Tikka Masala, and a vegetarian dish with 'vegetable balls' in a butter sauce.  These were served with basamati rice and we also ordered a side of naan (one garlic, one regular) for each of us.  
Everything was very fresh and full of flavor.  The boneless cubes of chicken in the masala were very good and not 'weird' like chicken can be sometimes.  

Oh, the parking sucks.  We parked a few streets east of the restaurant.  All the lots and both side streets surrounding are private.  Just a warning.  We ended up on E. 115th.  

Very satisfied with the meal, the leftovers, and the $25 off our $54 bill.  

***Happy Random Sidenote:  They have FOUNTAIN drinks.  Yum.***"}
{"text":"Better than average Indian food- excellent lamb korma and mann."}
{"text":"I was out on the east side Saturday morning. I didn't really know where to go so I drove around. I have been meaning to try the buffet here, so I did. I was glad this was my choice. The total comes out to $9 and some change. The dishes weren't really labeled so I tried them all. They were all great. I would like to come here starved so I could really eat a bunch of food. I usually am creeped out by buffets. For whatever reason, I will eat Indian buffets though. I just don't like how everyone touches the little spoons. I wish I lived closer. I prefer it to India Garden in Lakewood."}
{"text":"something i love: indian food.

something i love more: indian buffet

something i love most: wallet friendly, good selection, tasty indian buffet.

thanks cleveland for satisfying this california girl's indian craving and keeping her full all day."}
{"text":"Good Indian food can be hard to come by in the Cleve, so I'm jazzed to have found this little curry cave on Euclid! The outside of the joint doesn't do it justice, but once I went in I could tell by the aromas wafting from the tandoor that I was in for a treat!

On my first visit a friend and I split an order of the chicken tikka masala and the palak paneer (my go-to bellwether for assessing any Indian place); it was impossible to decide which was more delectable! The masala was so smooth, creamy, and flavorful as to inspire an addictive response and the palak paneer was so fresh that I could taste each of the individual spices and aromatics (ginger, garlic, onion, chili, garam masala) on my palate in each bite. 

This first visit surely won't be my last and I look forward to trying more of what Indian Flame has to offer!"}
{"text":"I order catering from them and have always been happy.  They price it well, deliver on time, and everything has been delicious!  Even my Indian coworkers have been impressed.  

Tika Masala 4 Eva!"}
{"text":"I don't usually like Indian food at restaurants. But this is the only place in Cleveland that I know that serves chaats, which are hard to explain what they are.

They're like snacks, but can be substantial when they contain crisped rice, chickpeas, and other \"meatier\" textures. They come with a sauce, sometimes sweet, sometimes tangy, sometimes yogurt. Chopped onions, and tomatoes. 

I go there only for the chaats. I haven't tried the other items because I like to keep it light. They have large visual displays on the walls (they're not paintings, but seem woven) that are probably inappropriate to a child's scrutinizing eye."}
{"text":"Indian food that delivers to me??? A-OK in my book!! I haven't actually dined in here - I've just ordered delivery a few times, so I can't comment on the service, lunch buffet, or the location like many of the other reviews. 

The food itself is pretty good. It's not the BEST Indian food I've had... I've had better in CLE, too. But, it's good. I've had it a few times and over those times, I've tried a variety of things:

    Samosas - pretty decent. Not too big and not really all that spicy. Could use some more flavor (only got this once)

    Papdi Chaat - so for those who don't know, this is traditionally fried dough pieces with chick peas, yogurt, potatoes, onions, spices, and cilantro. My order was missing the yogurt :-\ but everything else was super flavorful! (got this once)

    Palak Paneer - (aka Spinach and cheese entree) - DELICIOUS. Get it every time. Order it medium spicy and it has a kick. LOVE it.

    Paneer Tikka Masala (aka indian cheese in a tomato gravy sauce) - Decent. Tasty for sure but a little too runny for my liking. I feel like you should be able to pick up some gravy with naan, but when I've ordered it, I've only been able to dip.

    Rice - comes with the entrees. .... it's rice.

    Naan- LOVE ME SOME NAAN and their naan is delish. But, can you really screw up naan??

They are AWESOME for delivering... to downtown nonetheless- but the delivery has been sloooooow- but not because they haven't made it downtown on time... but b/c they can't navigate around where I live. So much so that the last time I ordered, I was handed my food 30+ minutes after I was told to come down because she was close. It's also not her fault she's not familiar with downtown. BUT, she was super nice, communicated the whole time, and felt HORRIBLE. Honestly I'll probably still order from them whenever I'm craving indian food and feeling lazy. But, I'll be sure to give them thorough directions to my place. 

It's anywhere from 11-16 dollars per entree (veg), which isn't horrible for indian food. You're usually spending that at any indian restaurant. Buffets at indian restaurants are usually the most cost friendly way to try a variety of things. I've read good things about their lunch buffet, so I'll probably head over there to check it out soon.

(congrats if you actually made it to the end of this essay) - i think I got carried away."}
{"text":"I have a higher tolerance than most people for dingy, even dirty Indian joints. I lived in India years ago, and all but the five star places (which I could not afford) were dingy and dirty, so the rule I began then and continue to follow to this day is just this: ignore almost everything, the place, the table, the floor, the server. But do not ignore the temperature: the food must be piping hot to burn off all the nastiness from the aforementioned everything else. 

I haven't been to the Flame in a long time, maybe a decade. At that time it was new, and I came away with what must have been a mostly favorable impression because it was that impression that led me to search for the Indian buffet in close proximity to University Hospital. 

Today we went there and I was damn glad I didn't bring my natal family, which I have coaxed into eating - even liking - Indian food. But this place would have laid waste to all of the progress I have made in that arena. The restaurant just looks extremely dirty - the walls are textured and dust has built up on the texture. Plus, the tables have been pushed against the wall in many places, scraping away paint. The other tables are kind of haphazardly placed, and everything just feels dirty, disorganized, not maintained. 

The food was passable - a buffet, so flaming hot is generally impossible to maintain - but many items were picked over (tandoori chicken) or low on the main draw (not much chicken in the curry chicken) or polluted by adjacent things (chutney in the kheer).

And the only restaurant staff visible was a young woman who never smiled at or exchanged a single word with us (even when we came in) and therefore never gave me a chance to bust out my Hindi....secondary concern, I know, but still. 

I came back after a decade, and I discriminate damn hard in favor of Punjabis. But sadly I think the chances that we try this place again are close to zero."}
