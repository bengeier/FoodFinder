{"text":"We ordered two pizzas and wings on a Friday night over the phone for pick up. They told us it would be ready in an hour. Sure, it's Friday a busy night so an hour seemed reasonable. My husband showed up an hour later and it was not ready. He had to park illegally because there is absolutely no parking available here and was very worried about the car getting hit.   It took another 45 minutes before he actually got the pizza. 1 hour and 45 mins is ridiculously long to wait! They should have cut off orders if they were that overwhelmed!  When we tasted the pizza, it was... Okay. The sauce tasted like sugar and the crust was bland. Kinda like the pizza you'd expect from a street vendor at 3am in the South Side.   We will never be back and will remain loyal to Krazy Brothers and Molly's Pizza in dormont for now on."}
{"text":"Pizza and meatball sandwich is delicious, portions are big, good service. Now my go to spot if I want a pie."}
{"text":"A basic place but the food is good and service is also, limited wine and beer"}
{"text":"I love this pizza. Great crust and sauce. Its one of a kind and could imagine any other pie."}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to Brookline last year and haven't been able to stop eating Fiori's since. So in love with the sauce and crust. The perfect pizza."}
{"text":"I love the Pizza!!! Very good and the crust is amazing.....I grew up eating The Original DiCarlos and this is a different style but equally as good!"}
{"text":"Fiori's has the best pizza in Pittsburgh in my opinion. I consider myself a pizza connoisseur and have traveled all around Pittsburgh to try as many pizza shops as possible. There are many goods ones but Fiori's still stands on top. A sweet sauce and the perfect blend of cheese and crust makes this pizza unmatched."}
{"text":"I love this pizza. The crust is a thin crust. The sauce is slightly sweet. The servers are always friendly."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza place in the Burgh. The sauce is sweet and the abundance of perfectly melted cheese goes perfectly with it. Their whole menu is great but I can't go there and not get pizza cause it's just too good to pass up!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but service was terrible (and they weren't even busy). Waited 20 minutes for our drinks and only got them because we got tired of waiting and flagged someone down (and they were wrong). In the meantime, the table across the way sat down a half hour after us and got their food before we did. Not an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"I grew up eating this.   Any time I'm on west liberty I stop and get a slice.  Great family owned business.   Sweet cheese."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good esp with a side of cold cheese. This is a must-stop place for us whenever we are in the area.   Downsides are: they don't accept cards (should use the square reader if anything), parking is horrible and the interior is small & crowded if you wanted to dine in."}
{"text":"Great salad, great meatballs, awesome pizza.  We order here all the time and we never regret it.  The sleeper is the wings.  Best around."}
{"text":"Easily in the running for the best pizzas in Pittsburgh, Fiori's is one of my favorite places to go! Great ravioli and calzones, but it's their meatball pizza that is truly out of this world! It has sweet sauce on incredibly soft and delicious crust with fantastic meatballs, but what makes a Fiori's pizza a Fiori's pizza is... the cheese! The best quality around and much more per pizza than any other place, it's what truly makes the pie one of the best in the burgh!"}
{"text":"There is no pizza in Pittsburgh that comes close to Fiori's. Sure, there are plenty of pizza places in this town that have decent pies, but Fiori's is pizza made in heaven.  AND YOU CAN BUY SLICES.  Imagine that."}
{"text":"If you ask me Harry's is better. Here they seem to add sugar to sauce and it loses the tomato flavor. Cheesy yes. But also doughy and overall a run of the mill pizza. Not sure where the legacy of great pizza comes from but you can do better."}
{"text":"This is some really good, cravable pizza, especially after an evening of delicious, and intoxicating spirits. Nothing fancy, just simply delicious pizza."}
{"text":"I love Fiori's, they have a great standard cheese pizza. The sauce is just right, not too sweet., the crust is just crispy enough, and the cheese is of decent quality. No frills eating at their West Liberty location features a tv and a pinball machine. Open til 3 am on weekends, making this place THE BEST late night food in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"I love N.Y. style pizza.  Could eat it every day.  On a recent to trip to Pittsburgh I tried alot of pizza and this was my fave.  One thing about Pitt pizza... it is slightly different than true NYC style:  the crust is not as thin and there's a whole lot more cheese.  As a rule Pitt pizza also has a slightly sweeter tomato sauce.  The sum of its parts is still delicious. A delicious close cousin to NYC pizza.  The pizza I tried in Pitt in my order of favorites: Fiori's Pizza Sola (Penn Circle Branch) Pizza Perfecta Aiello's (Murray Street) Beto's  Save for Beto's, I thought they were all delicious.  Wish I had a chance to try Mineo's.  A Pittsburgh native friend of mine calls this his favorite but they were closed July 5th when I went by their place on Murray... I'll try them next time I'm in the 'burgh.  I can't imagine anybody beating out Fiori's.  Their \"cuts\" (Pittsburgh parlance for \"slice\") were a perfect Pittsburgh version of NY style pizza.  Fiori's to me was the best in Pittsburgh because it had the perfect amounts of chew, char, crust, cheese, sauce.  The place itself has a perfect old school been-in-the-neighborhood-for-years vibe with a couple of tables and booths.  Unpretentious.  Neighborhood.  Open Late.  Perfect."}
{"text":"Folks gotta be kidding me here. The Fat Kid has eaten at MANY a pizza shop in this fair town and others, and I can say this with full confidence, that hands down, Fiori's is the best Pizza in the Burgh, and one of the best that has ever filled The Fat Kid's tummy anywhere.   The combination of things that Fiori's has in the pizza is what makes it special. A tremendous sweet sauce that still has a bite of tang to it when you get into it enough, the best crust ANYWHERE ( I believe Sprite is added to the crust or something of the sort to give it this flavor), tremendously thick, gooey, tasty cheese, it's fair share of grease (which ALL good pizzas MUST have, as eating pizza without grease is like drinking coffee without caffeine, it is just senseless), and excellent toppings when cooked in.   The Fat Kid usually will get his pie with Extra Cheese and Pepperoni, and this is by all means, the most fabulous of Fiori's combos, as the Roni's are always delish and the Cheese just makes the flavor of the Pizza swell and burst with intensity when it hits your palate.  Clearly, it is humorous to read some of the reviews on here, especially one's that endorse garbage Pizza like Krazy Brothers (Out Of Business), Vincent's (heavy and burnt and overgreasy), Molly's (cardboard dipped in vomit is better than a Molly's pie or most anything else from there, which is tremendously overpriced) are clear second-tier pies that just do not have the flavor to please an experienced palate like the Fiori's pie does.   Don't stop there though, the Cap and Cheese is tremendous, as is the Steak and Cheese sub, with a very nicely cooked hoagie bun that is both flavorful and of a fantastic texture, very similar to an old Latina Pizza hoagie (maybe the best Steak and Cheese in the Burgh at Latina's), and the sweet sauce that is put on this sub makes it one to die for. the Cap and Cheese is just a virtual monster of flavor, with a nice spicy kick.  Take it from The Fat Kid, when you come to the Buirgh, come to Fiori's. No one knows food like a Fat Kid, and you can lay safe money on that..."}
{"text":"Best pizza anywhere around Pittsburgh. I was so glad when they opened a second one in McMurray."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype of this place.   The sauce and cheese is good but there isn't any crust until the end because of all the grease.   Good but wish there was some additional flavor from the crust with each bite."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. The crust is different from the original but in a good way. We got a pie half pep & mushroom and half sausage &a hot peppers. The balance of the sweet sauce to the toppings is unmatched in Pittsburgh.   I also recommend the house made meatballs and the Italian hoagie , wow!!!!!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing. I always wondered how Mineo's and Aiello's in Squirrel Hill could have a competitor that I've never tasted. Well, Fiori's is the real deal. Awesome ingredients make awesome pizza.  When your focus is on Pizza, rather than how much real estate on Murray Avenue you can cover and what type of ice cream or cheesecake to carry, the result is amazing. So, yes it is Ok to travel outside the comfort zone and checkout this outside pizza treasures (Vincent's Rt. 30 inclusive)"}
{"text":"Best pizza hands down. Cheese cuts with steak sauce to dip it in is the way to go. Never tried anything besides pizza bc pizza is soon good no need too.."}
{"text":"I've tried a few of the more popular pizza places around Pittsburgh, such as Mineo's, Aiello's, and Shelly Pie Pizza. I intend to try all the best pizza on offer in the city, but so far Fiori's is my favorite! Amazing pizza, friendly staff, and it was nice to see that they take credit cards!"}
{"text":"Live and ate Fiore's pizza in Pgh for 40 years. Moved to Washington Co. And was stoked the see new location. My last pizza on Saturday was a disgusting mess. My pie was an oval uncooked disgrace. There where leftovers (unheard of with Fiore's ) I did not waste the tin foil to save it. Right in the trash. Never going back!!!"}
{"text":"They fix me up anytime I need a good fixin. Kenny Powers would absolutely love this place because all they do is fix people up and provide alllllll the fixins. Best Za not just in Yinzerville, but in the entire state."}
{"text":"always heard about this place.finally out in the south hills and tried it.very good pizza.would give 5 stars but pulling out of lot sucks"}
{"text":"Stifled my pizza fix but I found the sauce a little too sweet.  The place was packed so they are clearly doing something right.  Employees behind the counter were very friend, great local feel.  Very little seating so be ready to grab take out if necessary."}
{"text":"I've been going to Fiori's for 20-plus years never ever a problem but the last couple times I go there they forget your order they expect you to stand there and wait on their mess up I was just in there for 55 minutes to get two pizzas and it still wasn't ready when they tell you 20 on the phone it's on believable anymore that place used to be the best place in the city now it's one of the worst the food's great but the customer service sucks thank you telling you one more minute one more minute and then 30 minutes past so after 55 minutes I'm still leaving with no food unbelievable I can go spend $20 a pizza anywhere in the city you would think for the price you charge for food they would actually take care of their customers"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Burgh and the Italian salad is amazing..The wings are great also..When ppl come in from out of town I make sure they have a Fioris pie before they leave"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza. I've been on a good Pittsburgh pizza hunt. This place is now in the top of my list. Affordable, toppings are under the cheese, great quality."}
{"text":"Everything about this pizza was perfect. But let me say that Fiori's has got the crust down. This is the best pizza I've ever had. I only wish they had one in Portland."}
{"text":"Worst pizza and service I've  ever had anywhere .. the seating area was filthy. From condensation from the AC dripping in people's food to the filthy smelly rag used to wipe a table down..... pizza toppings were raw under ALL the cheese. Salad order was wrong and the owner was more worried about kissing the regulars ass's then hearing my complaints"}
{"text":"Stopped in because of the hype, got a pepperoni and a mushroom to go. Called in and asked if they had any specials and got the reply,  \"we don't do specials,\" in a tone conveying that the question was so offensive that it barely deserved an answer.  As for the pizza, it was fine.  Probably the 16th best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh so far, out of about 20 places (the pizza made to order at my local Get Go is only a step behind it).  There's also the possibility my pies were sabotaged because of the aforementioned question I asked, maybe it was the pizza artists' saliva pooling up on the slices rather than grease...   There's a chance I might stop in the bar next to it again, but little chance I'll step foot into the overpriced pizza establishment next door.  One final note, any place with this much hype and known for its fresh ingredients yet uses canned mushrooms is f**ked."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Fiori's pies, calzones and hoagies for almost 30 years sometimes 2 times a day. The dough is perfect and the sauce is remarkable. Parking can be a challenge but to go is always a good option. The Italian salad is also a tasty option. The best pizza ever."}
{"text":"The best. Is there any need to express what everyone else has?  Flawless crust cheese and sauce. Nothing compares"}
{"text":"When I heard about the slightly sweet sauce served on a Fiori's Pizza, I was doubtful about whether or not this would be a place for me. I have to say overall I liked it- but with a few caveats.  Parking stinks.  Don't bother eating in, just get take out. Grab a friend, have them drive and run in to pick up your pie. My quick bite of pizza took over two hours from finding a parking space, standing in line to order, waiting for my pizza to be made, getting a table with said pizza (there is very limited seating for eating in), eating and finally wriggling past the other waiting people to get out to search for the car. The place is CASH ONLY, no credit cards so make sure you got a twenty to buy your pie. (Fortunately they have an ATM on site but the fees!)  All my complaints aside, I did enjoy my pizza. The sweetness of the sauce was balanced by the saltiness of the olives they exuberantly provided on my pizza. The crowd of people in there provided for a quite interesting people-watching experience. The slices of pizza were unevenly divided and my eating companions were quick to grab what might have been fold-able slices, but I feel like folding was a possibility for the crust.  Overall, I'd go back."}
{"text":"I am so glad I finally found a sitdown place to enjoy excellent pizza. I absolutely refuse to go to a place that serves pizza shells or uses conveyor belts to cook the pizza. Pizza here is cooked in the traditional pizza oven and does not come out with burnt or singed edges. We enjoyed a nice thin crust pizza that was crisp and not chewy as well as a cheese calzone.  Beware that the small calzone is huge lots of ricotta cheese."}
{"text":"Yes the pizza is the best in the burgh.  But don't don't forget the wings.  They also have the best wings in the burgh.  They don't deliver.  They don't have to.  I'd drive for miles."}
{"text":"No frills, dive spot pizza. Not much space and not much to see, but great flavor/thicker style takeout pizza."}
{"text":"I search long and hard for top pizza joints.  Fiori's is up there. I walked a mile from a t stop to eat there.  I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh. The crust is fluffy. The sauce is sweet. There prices are reasonable. There should be one of every corner of America."}
{"text":"Loved this pizza. I had it for the first time a week ago. The counter people were very nice and were moving people through quickly. I love thin crust greasy pizza and this place didn't disappoint. We also had a salad and their small is huge. The dressing was great, not to vinegary."}
{"text":"There are some great pizza places in this City, and this is one of the best. Good balance of quality ingredients, and crust is consistently finished. The  small interior can get crowded at times, but the pizza is worth the minor inconvenience. Easily on par with Aiello's and Mineo's in Squirrel Hill, two of the more decorated pizza joints in Pittsburgh. Fiori's gets extra credit for using the small spicy pepperonis and always having a pinball game in the corner!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best thing about living in Brookline is the close proximity to Fiore's.  Unlike most pizzerias, I prefer my pie from Fiore's plain.  Aside from the cash-only store policy, the only downside is that the pizza doesn't really reheat well.  Even so, it is still my favorite pizza in a city packed with pizza joints.  They make a pretty decent steak hoagie, too."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at fioris... Huge disappointment. If I could give a zero I would. First, The waitress who brought our food to our table gave us a hard time because we asked to make sure our pizza was half sausage and half banana pepper. We had ordered quite a bit of food and the first repeat of the order back was wrong at the counter. The waitress was downright rude because I wanted to ensure the order was correct. Young girl, long brown straight hair with highlights, pink fiori shirt and a ton of black eyeliner, about 5'7\". Nobody wears name tags.... The kids in our party won't eat banana peppers and we were hungry; wanted to ensure the right pizza was brought out the first time. Heck it saves the establishment money by not making the wrong thing and jeeps us happy by not having crabby starving kids. The .hoagie we ordered was ok- serafinas is way better. wings were nothing special. Pizza was too doughy, not done enough/crispy and really greasy. You can find better pizza at bados, ardolinos or primantis. We will never be back; I'm not spending my hard earned money at an establishment with rude employees and average food. The place is convenient to our home, but for average food and crappy service I'll give another establishment my money. Seems to be a pretty consistent theme with this place too unfortunately."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in Pittsburgh. But parking absolutely sucks and I so wish that they delivered. But they're always busy. If you've never had Fiori's Pizza, try it."}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza in the Burgh. The place was bustling on a Monday at midnight. Always on point"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza.  Italian hoagies are good too.    If you haven't tired their pizza you should it won't disappoint.    Little costly for the pizza but you get what you pay for and it is worth it."}
{"text":"Good little pizza place. The sauce is somewhat sweet like others have said, but all in all a good little place to grab a slice."}
{"text":"Always good. Would be nice if the center of the pizza was baked a bit more but overall really good. They are always busy but the staff stays very friendly."}
{"text":"We stopped at Fiori's after a late night walking around the inclines in Pittsburgh--although it is no where near the inclines.  We decided to grab a large pizza to fix our hunger and were not disappointed.  Fiori's feels like a place out of a Ben Afflack movie--the neighborhood joint where everyone knows each other.  In our half an hour there, I must have seen 8 different chance occurrences between people in town.  Onto the pizza!  We got a 16 inch pie for just over 12 dollars!  Thin crust that was crispy, not overly cheesy or saucy--although the sauce did have a distinct sweet flavor.  Baked to perfection--lightly golden brown.  Enjoyable flavor!  If you have been to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, it's a similar style with a different taste.    Overall: the pizza is good, atmosphere is easy! Don't listen to the haters, although parking is a pain."}
{"text":"I eat out 14 times a week, all over the U.S. I think it's time to start giving honest feedback; helping others make informed dining decisions.   This was a takeout for 6:  +Very friendly staff +Clean atmosphere  +Pizza is fantastic!  +Meatballs were tasty.  +Magic Hat #9 while we waited.  +TV's, too.  +Very casual +They take American Express!  Overall Grade: 93% out of 100% I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The pizza was too greasy and had too much cheese. It was largely disappointing. Not sure what all the fuss was about."}
{"text":"Good pizza, great hot sausage sandwich.  To go orders are ready when they say.  Staff is friendly and willing to go that extra mile.  Dining room is clean and wait staff eager to please.  I go there for the wonderful hot sausage.    Same great food as Brookline but easy parking and nice new building.  Did I mention the great hot sausage sandwich."}
{"text":"Serious, best pizza in Pittsburgh. Every time I go there everyone is so nice and pleasant and the pizza is killer!!!! Just move to pittsburgh and i gotta say it's better than New York pizza!!!"}
{"text":"To me pizza is pizza when it's ordered from these kinds of places. Each one has its special little touch but what people don't realize is the dough and sauce are what make the pizza taste different. Here you get a completely different taste from your everyday pizza and I think that's the drawing point. However I think it's a little over priced and not worth parking and getting from.   Place used to be a dump but since has fixed it up a bit. Good place to stop after a long night of drinks and bar hopping though, but just do pick up. The place will most likely be packed."}
{"text":"Best pizza in McMurray. Reasonably priced! They use real Italian sausage and mushrooms instead of the rabbit turds."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh hands down, and it's priced very fairly. The crust, sauce, and cheese all are 100% perfect.  I have other favorites in Pittsburgh but Fiori's is definitely my #1.  Besides their pizza, they also have excellent pasta and hoagies for a fair price."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, quick,service inside was better than a restaurant I tipped but did not see a tip cup, I like that they were not asking for tips at all. When we were outside It smelled like a classic pizza shop that uses quality ingredients.  I will return after I try the other two.  It was nice seeing the owner making the pizza through the window.  Ok I tried the other two, hands down best pizza 1.sauce is best I ever had, 2. Dough/crust was perfect, Cheese was just enough not greasy."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in Pittsburgh. I suggest eating in, as this pizza is at it's best when it's piping hot.  I swear they've had the same gents working there since I've been going for over 15 years."}
{"text":"Just go. If you haven't, you need to.  Every time I eat in, I burn my mouth on the delicious napalmy cheese... But it's so hard to wait.  My recommendation is plain Jane, or pepperoni and onion."}
{"text":"Though the pizza is amazing, with the crust and cheese being perfect, the atmosphere/neighborhood isn't exactly my idea of \"five star\""}
{"text":"They don't deliver, they don't take debit/credit, they don't advertise, and they've been in business more than 30 years.  That's enough to proof that its a top-notched well established restaurant.  They also happen to have Pittsburgh's best pizza.  Perfect sauce to cheese ratio, unique sweetness to the sauce, and a crust that's not too thick or too thin.  Just absoultely great pizza."}
{"text":"Best. Pizza. Ever.  The sauce is sweet.  The mozz. cheese is like less than $3 for soft drink container full of 24 oz. of real, cold cheese to put on the warm pizza.  Would cost you like $8 for same amount of cheese at Ginormous Eagle.  Buffalo wings are good.  I enjoy their house Italian dressing for the salad that comes with garlic bread which is boat shaped.  White pizza is fantastic.  Cheese and/or Pepperoni pizza is great.  Only thing we don't like are the mushrooms on the pizza.  The staff is extremely nice and we've tried to tip them many times, but they always refuse.  Just pretend like you \"forgot\" your change and go out the door if you are trying to tip them!  Fiori's Pizzaria is a gold mine in Peters Twp. and rightfully so...as the products of their labor is almost to die for!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city.  Period.  Pizza is obviously very subjective.  We have had pies from the best spots in NYC and Jersey, and while they are excellent in their own right, Fiori's is every bit as good (albeit different)."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I've never physically been inside Fiori's, but I've had their pizza several times. In a word: forgettable.  The last take-out pie we got was less than pleasing to the eye. All the cheese was on half the pie. The onions were diced - an interesting choice - and I actually liked that they were raw. The green peppers seemed to have been cut willy nilly, but that's OK. It's not 5-star, it's pizza. The pizza has a sweet taste to it, and I can't can't if it's the sauce or the dough, but I suspect the former.   Overall, I'd eat it again, but wouldn't go out of my way. I suspect it would be really delicious cold, for breakfast."}
{"text":"All I can say is.... YUM!! We came after a visit to the farm. We were found starving during a rainy night. You are gaurenteed to have a parking problem because it is located right at the bottom of a brick hill. But despite all of this, it is delicious pizza! Super cheesy, warm, just overall very good pizza!"}
{"text":"I've only been in Pittsburgh a year and so far this is the best pizza in town.  Everything from the crust, to the cheese, to the sauce and to the toppings are top notch and very tasty.  But I had to take off one star for the service.  I always get carry out and 4 out of 5 times, the pizza took twice the amount I was told on the phone.  They are usually busy but come on.  On my last pick up order, I was told it would be 40 minutes.  Got there in 45 minutes and I had to wait another 40 minutes before I got my pizza.  If it wasn't for that, I'd probably eat here 1-2 times a week on a regular basis.  Just an update.  I cut down my rating to 1 star.  Since my last review, I was going here about 1-2 times a month.  What I've found is that their food quality has slipped (i.e. less toppings, inconsistency in cheese topping, etc)  and their service has gotten much worse.  The average time I have to wait beyond their stated time has increased and their rudeness has gotten much worse both on the phone and at the counter.  I am now in search of another pizza restaurant."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh, in my humble opinion ; )  It's cheesy and doughy w/ a sweet sauce...it's just all kinds of goodness!  Take-out is great, but eating there is fun, also.  Try the house salad, too - surprisingly good.  Parking can be an issue sometimes, but spaces usually open up quickly."}
{"text":"We were in town for the US Open and found this restaurant via on the Yelp  the way to the hotel (it was maybe 10 minutes out of the way and well worth the drive).  The pizza was great.  The combination of sauce and cheese worked really well together.  Fiori's is now on my son's list as a must stop when in Pittsburgh.    He ranks it right up there with his favorite Hoboken pizza which says a lot."}
{"text":"Fiori's Pizza is so good! It is a very small little place if you want to eat in there but many people take pizza to go. The crust is like a sourdough like bread and it is so good. The sauce is a little sweet, the pizza is just amazing! It's very small in there and there are only like 3 booths, and 3 tables...in the evening it can get a little crowded inside from not only people eating in, but the people in line waiting to put their order in or picking up a to go order. Bottom line, I totally recommend getting Fiori's pizza."}
{"text":"Food's good but the staff is not just rude but actually insulting.  They'll make snide comments about you right in front of your face and be too dumb to realize you can understand them.  Let's face it, there are other pizza joints in town where you don't have to walk in and feel transported back to middle school gym class.  This is not a kitchen staff, it's a teenage circle jerk."}
{"text":"Best Fu*king Pizza in Pittsburgh. Do yourself a favor and try this. FYI. Cash only. But they do have an ATM"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. everything I've ever had is delicious. the service is great, and the sandwiches are may favorite"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!! We try a lot of pizza places in Pittsburgh...this by far has the best...the cheese pizza is perfect itself! I love the cheese and the sauce has a sweet taste!!! Only complaint  is the largest size is a large which is 10 pieces!"}
{"text":"It's close, Fiori's is consistently up for my vote for best pizza in the Burgh, but narrowly loses to Mineo's. That said, every time I'm in the South Hills I craveeee some Fiori's. Sweet sauce, perfect amount of cheese, and crispy crust.   The staff is incredibly friendly - prices are comparable to Mineo's as well as a large is around $16. We usually go basic and get half plain half mushroom. They don't pile on a ton of toppings and I actually prefer it that way.  Hope to try one of their hoagies at some point as well."}
{"text":"Went here from a friends overwhelming support of the place. I got a pep pizza, and an order of meatballs and garlic bread. Pizza was so-so, crust was flavorless, sauce was bland, the meatballs were fantastic with the garlic bread. I would go again for the meat a balls, but not pizza..."}
{"text":"This is as close that you can get to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle pizza that we all knEw and loved as kids. Let the pie cool down for 10 minutes before eating so the cheese is nice and sticky. Hands down the best pizza in Pittsburgh, seriously... 1/2 cheese, 1/2 pepperoni FTMFW!!!!!"}
{"text":"Used to be a devout Mineos kind of guy but I have been converted to Fiorism.   Just love the cheese and crust."}
{"text":"The crust was thicker than a typical new york style pizza. I felt the sauce was a little bland and wished there was more seasoning but the amount of cheese was perfect. We had the pepperoni. I guess this place is better than the other pizza places in the Pittsburgh area; however, it's not anywhere close to some of the best pizzerias in New York like Grimaldis and Di Faras. The small was more than enough for 2 people. We did not feel that the pizzas were too salty. This place is cash only."}
{"text":"This pizzeria with the motto \"We'll fix you up\" was recommended to us, so we decided to give this open-late pie place a try. It was a trip delayed by wrecks on the Parkway and construction on the Liberty Bridge, but it was worth the trip. It was busy with most of the tables full and a line of people picking up orders. Despite that, the service was excellent; and our pizza was in front of us in about 10-15 minutes. The sauce was great with the pepperoni hiding and sharing flavor beneath the cheese that came away in those hanging shreds as we lifted the slices to our plates. I like a little thinner crust, but that's just me. Give it a try sometime."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this pizza has such a following. Its nothing special. Just a normal pie thats heavy on the cheese. My girlfriend said the sauce was really sweet. It was sweet but I really didn't notice it until she brought it to my attention. Others say it tastes like someone poured a bunch of sugar into that. I don't understand that...sauce is supposed to be a little bit sweet.  My fault was in the crust. Crust, sauce and toppings make a pizza. If you have excellent toppings and delicious sauce on top of a crappy crust, you have a crappy pizza. There's no way around this. This crust wasn't anything to write home about. I didn't eat the ends which should say something. The crust wasn't crispy, it ended up getting soggy before we were done eating it. Also, the pizza itself was constructed poorly. The crust itself was about 2 inches long. And then there's about an inch of two of sauce before you even get to the cheese. It really looks like some eight grader put the pizza together. Seriously, cheese should cover the sauce and there was a huge gap between the sauce and the cheese.  Everything tasted good, though. Tons of cheese...I really liked the cheese. It is chewy though, but I appreciated that. The sauce was sweet but nothing out of the ordinary. The pepperoni was tasty, too. Everything tasted fine, the texture of the crust and the sloppy pizza construction were negatives. Still, I do not understand why this place is considered that great. Just a normal pizza place serving normal pizzas."}
{"text":"A friend and I travelled to Pittsburgh for a haunted house.  I went on Yelp to find good pizza and the reviews said this was the best pizza in Pittsburgh!  I would have to agree.  It was amazing pizza! Completely lives up to all of the excellent reviews."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and homemade meatballs. The sauce was perfect! The whole crew made us visitors feel right at home. Thank you! See you soon!"}
{"text":"First I must clarify that my rating here is based on my scale of pizza-ratings only. This pizza is certainly edible, but it is not at the top of my pizza-scale, a place reserved for the Grimaldis and Lombardis of the world (or, more realistically, just the U.S.; Italian pizza, I have heard and trust, is even better).  Fiori's is just underwhelming. I had family from New Jersey visiting and we were looking to grab a few pies after exploring around town. Piccolo Forno was unfortunately closed so I looked to the trusty internet to help me find something near our location that had a good reputation. Fiori's was a popular choice with decent ratings, so we headed over that way. The restaurant space is cramped and only conducive to tables of 4 guests or less in a party. Service was helpful, friendly, and quick. But the pizza just fell flat. The sauce was so sweet, which is not normal outside of this region (not sure what sweet tomato sauce is about, but I don't dig it. There has to be sugar added or something.). Dough was ok but wasn't that perfect medium for the simple yet magical tomato and mozzarella combination that it ought to be. If you are expecting New York style pizza, this is NOT the place for you. Average at best, but better than your fast-food pizza places if you are in a pinch. For me, that will be never."}
{"text":"I made the right choice by ordering that very simple dish...spaghetti and meatballs! The sauce at Fiori's is heavenly and the meatballs were some of the best I have had in a while. The portion sizes were huge and they give you plenty of garlic bread on the side.  The staff is friendly and always wear a smile.  I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Pittsburgh! I love the pepperoni pizza and the fresh home made mild Italian sausage is super as well. It's always tasty every pizza they make here nowhere else makes a better pie. It is always busy on the weekends and you have to wait but I don't care because it is so worth it. I have try a lot of places in town and nobody comes close . I am looking for another place to get pizza! But there is no better place. We like everything you make. Love this place. Staff are great and the pizza is always yummy ! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"WOW, is this good pizza! We had a large pepperoni pizza and provolone sticks with marinara and all of it was absolutely delicious. The atmosphere was really pleasant as well, very clean and aesthetically pleasing, not grimy like most other pizza places I've been to. I will definitely be returning, hopefully sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"Tried Fiori's for the first time.  I have to say, I thought it was very good.  I have heard some say that the pizza is too cheesy, and I agree in that it is very cheesy - but I enjoyed it greatly.  I had a small pie with capicola and banana pepper rings.  My only complaint was that I felt like there were too many pepper rings, but that's probably a personal preference.    If you're looking for thin crust 'za, this is not your jam.  The crust is doughy but crisp on the outside.  If you like more sauce than cheese, not your cup of tea (great Napoli-style pizza can be found at Il Pizzaiolo Mt. Lebanon).  Crispy crust? Check out Piccolo Forno in Lawrenceville.  Otherwise, go to Fiori's!  (It's best for takeout, and was quick for that.  There aren't many tables and the place is small.  If you're looking for a nice dine-in experience, I suggest you go elsewhere!)"}
{"text":"I have eaten pizza all up the coast . I never been to NY so that being said this is some of the best pizza one can find. No one can make hives and calzones like them. When I am back home from GA I have to eat here at least twice the week I am in because I never know when I am going to get a good pizza again"}
{"text":"After hearing raves about the original Fiori's, I was looking forward to trying a pie from the PT location.  The venue itself (it's in a former Parkvale Savings Bank building) is quite nice and offers a pleasant atmosphere for a sit-down dinner.  As a child of 1970s/80s Peters Township, I so enjoyed sitting in the now departed Pizza Hut and with my family and partaking in, what was then, the best pizza in the area.  So, a nice venue scores points with me.  However, I'm now mostly taking out pizza so my rating is ultimately based on the quality of the pie itself.  In that regard, Fiori's is...okay.  The crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings are all average.  They make a good pizza.  It's certainly better than most chains and superior to most of what I find downtown.  It's just not great, and doesn't measure up to Harry's, Italian Village, or Ollie's.  Peters Township is home to some excellent pizza joints.  Fiori's is a \"good\" pizza, but there are better options."}
{"text":"Fiori's is a pretty decent option for a pie. Nothing is offensive about their pizza, so it would appeal to most tastes, but that said, there are some issues with that approach that make it hard for Fiori's to compete in my mind with Mineo's or Aiello's. First is that there's nothing stand out special about the pie. The sauce is inoffensive, but sort of bland. Not overly seasoned. The crust at the end is good, but before you get to that, all the bread has been saturated with grease from the cheese or pepperoni, which is well seasoned but often a bit too charred for me. Some may prefer a crisper pepperoni, so that would suit their tastes. The cheese is not overwhelming, but it's also not particularly special.   This is just a middle of the road pizza to me. Nothing great, nothing terrible. Sometimes that's all you need."}
{"text":"Really don't get the high praise for their pizza. Great pizza has to have the three basics: sauce, crust and cheese all be great. Their sauce is so thin and tasteless. Their crust is maybe the only part that approaches great. The cheese is almost too much."}
{"text":"Best pizza. Every time I'm back in town visiting I have to stop by.  Just some plain slices w extra cold cheese on top and don't forget the carton of iced tea"}
{"text":"Admittedly, I'm a pizza snob, I lived in Italy for a number of years and I'm hard to impress when it comes to American Pizza. All this thick crust nonsense drives me nuts - I want a good balance of crust, sauce, cheese & toppings not a mouthful of bread.  Fiori's delivers some TASTY pizza. Will I say that it's the same type of pizza as Italy, absolutely not, but it's still really freaking good.   I give it 5 stars because the pizza, but I would not recommend ordering their mozzarella sticks - less than stellar and for such a simple food item, I was surprised how bad they were."}
{"text":"Simply the best pizza. Hoagies, wings, and salads are excellent as well. This place is heralded as the best pizza in Pitt for a reason."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizza in the Burgh. The sauce is sweet, the crust is soft and doughy and the cheese is amazing. My go to order is a cheese and banana pepper pizza. Always delicious! I have never had a bad experience here. When I stop in for a take out order my pizza is always nice and piping hot. You can't go wrong with Fiori's!"}
{"text":"Simply the best! Good prices good food and friendly staff. Never a bad slice of pizza there."}
{"text":"i highly recommend this pizza.  i'm a fan of several different pizza styles and this is a good old medium crust style.  it's more on the side of ny style pizza with that medium sized crust.  i tried a large mushroom with half pepperoni.  they bury the pepperoni under the cheese (minus one star).  i prefer seeing the pepperoni because of the fact we only wanted half the pizza with pepp and couldn't tell which side was which.  we had leftovers and i wasn't as big of a fan of the cold pizza from here.  i will say though, this pizza fresh from the oven- the best i've had yet here in pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Fioris is highly rated and reviewed by fellow yelpers but my first outing here wasn't what I expected . Time to serve : way too long ! It surely was quite busy on a Saturday evening but even then - it took close to 20+ mins to get the pizza . Thank god for the beer ! The Pizza itself : we ordered a half with the pepperoni and the other half with sausage. Unfortunately- the toppings were hardly visible - felt like eating just a cheese pizza . BTW - the Pepperoni tasted like it had just come out of a giant eagle freezer ! Hopefully that's not what they use .  The place itself was buzzing - a lot of grandparents with their grandkids . Will give it a 2nd try- but my search for a good pizza place in Mc Murray and neighboring areas continues ."}
{"text":"Good and friendly service. We had pizza here and I feel that the pizza crust can do with more flavor but comes out nice and crunchy."}
{"text":"I love pizza. A lot of people like one type of pizza. I like all kinds. Lets make that clear.  I love the pizza in Italy, New Haven CT, Post Corner pizza in Darien,CT,NYC and even the French make a mean pie.   This pizze is a NY style. If this is not your fancy, move on.  Perfect slice thickness, chewey with chrispness, tastefull sauce and a balance of cheese.  I had two slices. One cheese and one with meatball. Both very hot out of the oven. The meatball was my favorite. Cut up homeade meatballs on pizza!   No credit cards. ATM onsite."}
{"text":"Never disappointed with anything from here. Pizza is the best in Pittsburgh, I do like Mineos but they are over priced.  Hoagies and wings are excellent at Fiores as well."}
{"text":"Ok I'm from the southhills and realize people in Pgh have no idea what good pizza is. I assure you this place isn't it. Problem is the block heads that love this place so much just say they love it cause they are from brookline and think it's cool to say \"I love fioris\" with a really slang sound . Hoagies are garbage and sorry but provolone cheese isn't used on a true ital pizza and sweet sauce ? Garbage !!!! After all the garbage food you get unbelievable attitude. Lol this place would not last 2 weeks in New York plain and simple!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The pizza is fabulous and the sauce is amazing! You have to try It! We had pizza with meatballs, my son had a chivken parmigiana sandwich it was just delicious! 2nd bedt pizza ever!"}
{"text":"As good as their pizza is, is as bad as their customer service.  I've gotten pizza here about 10 times since moving to the area.  Each time the service has been in the two star range.   Today they reached a new low.  Girl that took my order had that \"why are you bothering me \" way about her. Lost my order then said it would take 30 minutes to fix. \"that's just where we are\" said the guy clerk. No \"I'm sorry \" nothing like that. Just a condescending \"too bad for you dude\" attitude.  No offer to waive the cost or maybe even no charge for mushrooms.  They probably spit in my pizza just for fun. Needless to say management is nonexistent and they don't care about customers. Wonder what goes on in the kitchen... Pompous and , \"we don't need you petty little customer\" attitude.    I have many choices in this neighborhood and I won't be choosing this place again."}
{"text":"If your from Pittsburgh and have never had Fiori's shame on you (especially if your from the South Hills). I don't need to elaborate, as everyone else already has. The only beef I've ever had with them is that they don't deliver!"}
{"text":"Fantastic steak subs! The sauce almost reminds me of ham BBQ's. I get one every other week or so. Occasionally it will be a longer wait than i would expect for just 2 steak sandwiches, but has been worth it every time so far!"}
{"text":"Fiori's is my favorite pizza of all time. If I were ever to leave Pittsburgh, Fiori's would be something I'd definitely come back for. Thin crust, sweet sauce, generous melty cheese....heaven to my tastebuds. It's also great cold! I can eat a Fiori's slice hot, cold, any time of day. Personally, the plain is my favorite but really, you can't go wrong with any of the toppings as long as you get the red sauce as your base. Fiori's also has a white pizza that I wouldn't mind having from time to time, but the red sauce is where it's at!  One downfall is that they don't deliver. It's a bummer, but it makes driving there to grab a pie all the more special. Another downfall is that it's located on the most annoying cobblestone hill with very limited parking, but man is it worth the trouble getting there!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza and Subs. 45 minutes for take out pizza when their busy"}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza in the Burgh. And the staff was so friendly and accommodating brought us out a bunch of different sauces to try and dip our crust in! Really made us feel like locals/ will absolutely be back! Prices so reasonable and food was just great"}
{"text":"Fiori's was good.  The layout is a little confusing if you have not been there before.  The staff was super helpful and welcoming--they helped us understand the structure of Fiori's (pick up a menu when you walk in, order at the register, they bring you your food and drinks).    I thought the Pizza was just okay.  The crust and cheese were good.  The sauce was blan and unmemorable.  The pizza was also very pricey.  I was surprise to see how busy the place was.    The Staff was very friendly.  Everyone kept checking on us to make sure we were enjoying our food and time at Fiori's."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza. Joe always makes it the way I like it Easy Cheese and green peppers. Great dough, perfect sauce and cheese. Friendly people.  I love it."}
{"text":"Fiori's is way too close to my house.....my waistline hates that!! But man o man is this good effing pizza!!! Best in Brookline......best in South hills, hell.....best pizza in pgh!!!!"}
{"text":"What a excellent place highly recommend we go at least once a week pleasant staff food is ALWAYS fresh and HOT"}
{"text":"Best Pizza is Pittsburgh, probably in the country! I've been eating here all my life and when I moved away 7 years ago it was one of the things I missed most. Every time I come into town it is my first and last stops, and usually a couple times in between. I prefer plain cheese, it is so good, it doesn't need any toppings!"}
{"text":"Ordered a meatball calzone & assumed it came with sauce. Took in home & it was just a glob of cheese, questionable meat & soggy crust. I got nauseated 3 hours after eating half. Had to throw the rest away. I wasted $13 what turned out to be a laxative."}
{"text":"In short, really great pizza and really friendly staff!  My wife and I were visiting Pittsburgh for business and asked around for the best pizza in town.  We were given a few options but Fiori's came up the most regularly, so we decided to give it a shot and we are glad we did! Not only is the pizza excellent, but we also tried fried provolone sticks and they were amazing.  The marinara dipping sauce that came with them was also so good, we ordered two containers of it to go so we could just dip bread in it at home.  The staff was very friendly and the place was so busy is was difficult to walk - but even the other patrons were friendly.  It was kind of like a home away from home for the night.  We will definitely visit again whenever we are near."}
{"text":"My girlfriend is much newer to the area so I try to take her to real Pittsburgh places. Fiori's should be held right up there next to Primanti's as a staple. South Hills icon.   There's old world charm when you order. Pie comes out quick. It's awesome deliciousness scored me many points with the lady and satisfied my soul for making my not-often-enough trip to this fantastic pizza icon of the City of Champs.   Preach."}
{"text":"Was 6 out of 5 stars up to ten or so years ago when the cheese changed.  Still top notch and best pie around unless you go to beaver county.  Sweet sauce is amazing.  I once ordered extra extra extra sauce because previous requests for extra sauce were not taken as serious as I would have liked.  This one was taken serious and I got soup and let me tell you, it was still delicious."}
{"text":"Arguably the best pizza in the burgh. Very cheesy with a hint of sweetness to the sauce. Too messy and greasy for some, pizza nirvana for me. Their hoagies are really good too. They're huge. Hard to park but hey we'll give em a freebee on that one. 2 large one topping is around 37$. Not too shabby. Oh yeah, and their sausage is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"best pizza in the south hills.  possibly in the city.  old style pizza shop with a get it and get the hell out of the way atmosphere.  my mouth is watering right now just thinking about this place..."}
{"text":"Three strikes and you're out! I don't know if they changed something with their pizza but it's not the same. Went from being our favorite to just another pizza joint.  Wish them well but for what you pay for pizza and cheese sticks, I guess we expected better~"}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza that lives up to the reputation. The cheese was delicious and toppings were hearty. Looking forward to ordering Fiori's again!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and looking specifically for a pizza place.  The reviews were great so I expected them to be busy.  I called and said I wanted to dine in and asked if they were busy.  \"Not at all, come on in\". Told them I'd be there in 10 mins.  I get there in 5, park on the god awful stone hill only to find the place is packed.  Tables are full, people are standing waiting for thier order, and there are no more spots on the street.  So, I left.  I don't appreciate being lied too and I was in no mood for a long wait (thus calling ahead...).  I'll probably never try this place, which is unfortunate because they may have delicious food."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the hype of this place. To be honest, had the personal recommendations from friends not made this place seem like the biggest deal in the city, then I would have probably rated it a 3 or 4. The pizza was just OK. It was decently greasy and the crust wasn't all that special. They wouldn't deliver (Even though I am literally a few blocks from them) and they don't accept credit / debit card - a huge downfall for me."}
{"text":"Serviceable pizza.  The hype overshadows the pizza somewhat.  I can forgive the quirks of a new place and the longer lead times.  I guess this pizza is an acquired taste sweeter sauce that alone might not endear my pallet but in ok. My taste prefers more savory.  The ambiance is a bit overwhelming, sterile and swallows the charm of a family owned vibe.  Love the pepperoni but loathed the sausage."}
{"text":"Grew up on Fiori's pizza and Hoagies!  Just love it and Staff that have been there for years!  Consistent and yummy! Live out of town now but I call in an order as I approach the city!"}
{"text":"Sorry, I really don't get the hype. Heard people rave so dropped $50 on pizza pasta salad and apps to get a sampling of their menu and was very disappointed. Sauce was not good to me and everything else was just ok. I was disappointed. I guess this one just isn't for me."}
{"text":"WOW!  This is some really great pizza!  I mean, GREAT!  It is a perfect balance of sweet and savory, gooey cheese and crispy/doughy crust.  We ordered a 6 oz. side of sauce with our large pizza to go and it really made those crusty final bites of each slice all the more delectable.    We ordered on a Saturday night and called ahead - wait time was around 40 mins so that worked out perfectly with our commute from the North Hills.  Yes, we crossed a river and drove through a tunnel for this pizza.  And, we'd do it again.  It's worth every penny.  Their buffalo wings are another fantastic story in and of themselves.  Try them well done.  The sauce was really, really good and the wings were meaty and crispy.  Yowza good!  Get thee some Fiori's!"}
{"text":"Just like the original shop!  Honestly the best around!  Weather your in the Canonsburg/Peters area or by the Pittsburgh shop, it's a must to stop in!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh. Great old school owner as well. Their pasta is really good too. Assuming you enjoy their sweet sauce. Not a big fan of their hoagies but they're acceptable."}
{"text":"A south hills legend.  The only problems are a total lack of parking and long wait but a great pizza if you can be patient."}
{"text":"Drunk, sober, 11am, or 2:30am there isn't a better place for pizza. Nice sweet sauce with that tasty fiori's crust. Tried the wings for the first time, and they do them right too. Love love love Fiori's!"}
{"text":"If you want great pizza this is the place.  Sauce is a bit sweet which is great and thin pizza and melty cheese makes it my first choice.   Just need to improve the seating situation"}
{"text":"I literally don't even have words for my love for Fiori's. If I were stranded on an island and could only choose one food to have, it would be Fiori's pizza. That is all."}
{"text":"4 years ago, my wife and I did our own \"best pizza in Pittsburgh\". We tried pizza from 12 different places in Pittsburgh. Fiori's came in to this competition as our favorite spot and after trying 11 other spots, Fioris's still is #1.    Nothing in this world beats their double crust pepperoni pizza with a side of cold cheese. Keeping it simple. I now don't eat dairy but every couple months, I get crazy and get some pizza from Fioris."}
{"text":"I had excellent service, the woman who took my order was so nice. After I was done I asked for a box to take the rest home and she came over and boxed it for me. I didn't have to wait too long for it to come out. Plenty of seating inside. Delicious pizza!!! I just love the cheese."}
{"text":"On their website their wings are 7.50 I just ordered wings and the guys says 9.75 I tell him that his website says differently he says \"oh well iiiiddkkk they're set in the computer for 9.75\" seriously? Haha guess it's the marketer in me. Haha 2 stars for their horrible website upkeep. Pizza is bomb tho."}
{"text":"This pizza is the best! Pepperoni pizza is all I've had... but it's wonderful. I like supporting local places, and this is the place to do it. It's been too long since I've gone to Fiori 's and now I'm in the mood for a slice for sure! Not the place to diet that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite pizza place in Pittsburgh so far.  Tried a few pizza joints around the area but none had pizzas quite like Fiori's. This is a cool and casual place that serves New York style pizzas by the slice just the way I like it. The cheese was nice and stringy and you get plenty of toppings with each slice.  There's a few tables inside there but this is more like a fast food pizza joint. Great if you just want a quick slice to eat or getting take out!"}
{"text":"Solid pizza.  Interesting cheese blend, a healthy amount of toppings, good texture to the crust.  Nothing special here but it was good.  Small little place with possibly difficult parking (we got lucky).  Not anything better than any other good pizza I have ever had, but certainly not bad."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh hands down. Sweet sauce thick crust and cheese my personal preference is the cheese pizza but ask for it slightly we'll done so the cheese doesn't fall off and it's absolute perfection. But if you want the traditional Fiori's with the cheese falling off it's still just as good!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. We love their pizza. I don't like pizza from anywhere else except for here, because I hate chunky sauce. The sauce here is much smoother than anywhere else & a little sweet! It is delicious. We come atleast once a week. They have beer & wine too. The pizza is unlike any other. Will be back of course!"}
{"text":"I've been eating Fiori's Pizza since the 1970's. I really like it. Their Italian salads, hoagies and other food is top notch as well. For the last eleven years , I've eaten at Fiori's at least one day per week for lunch since I worked close to that location. Like their motto says, \"We fix you up\". Nice people and great service."}
{"text":"I love this place. I grew up in Beechview and moved away to Maryland. Every time I am in town I have to get their pizza! No pizza joints like this in Baltimore"}
{"text":"Good pizza . Not the best but good. Light years better than all the chains like papa johns/dominos/etc etc etc ...  Delivery would be nice but I live close by so it's not a big deal to get there . The hoagies are so so .   Good luck parking your car if you head here at night, especially.  Seems to be a favorite spot for night-shift city cops to chow . Kudos to that old dude who is the owner for finally implenting debit/credit card payment ... welcome to the modern age ... ***man beaten/killed outside Fioris(seen on twitter)  http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2016/05/18/Police-investigate-1/stories/201605180164  ***"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT PIZZA! The service is pretty slow though and they aren't so truthful with you about how long it will be. Call ahead you say? Sometimes they are so busy they don't even answer the phone. FRUSTRATING! If you do reach them there is no way your pie is ready when you arrive. I have called as long as two hours ahead and was it ready? NOPE! They should raise the price of each pie about $3 or $5 so they can actually handle their business. The 5 stars is for the pizza...I have to be in a 5 star mood to put up with their 1 star service."}
{"text":"The demand for this pizza in Peters has skyrocketed, so I wasn't surprised about the hour+ wait on an early Friday night. However, on a separate occasion, I picked up a couple small pizzas I ordered and they were both placed in the box too soon, so the cheese slid entirely off the pizza. It wasn't as good as it could have been because of the messiness, BUT I'd be willing to try it again. We did call and they apologized/gave us credit for next time.  It was good anyway and the sauce was just the right amount of sweet!"}
{"text":"My husbands friends rave about this place, but I found the sauce too sweet, the toppings bland and the Italian sub bland and made with poor quality bologna type meats.  Very cheap meats, no spices, no sauces.  Average Appalachian pizza made for the 90's era.  Drive a block and try the Anthonys Coal Fired for a more modern taste profile."}
{"text":"The pizza here is good.   I don't know if I would say that it is the best pizza in Pittsburgh though as others claim. It is on par with most New York style home neighborhood pizzerias.   If you are in the area, stop by and try a slice and be your own judge.   We will definitely stop back through whenever in the area. Don't think it will be an out of the way destination though with other options around our neighborhood.   This place can get pretty crowded and parking is very sparse so make sure you have someone that can run in and pay while you either drive around or wait."}
{"text":"Easily the best pizza in the burgh. The Peters shop is definitely an upgrade over the Brookline one but still the same great taste. Plus they have plenty of TV's to watch the game and sell beer at this one too."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh staple.  Perhaps even an institution.  Scientifically proven to taste delicious with or without beers AND before or after beers.  But best with, of course.  Worth crossing the one (or several) of Pittsburgh's many bridges or tunnels.  In fact, I'd cross an ocean for their pepperoni pie.   Don't forget to always get a side of meatball(s). Delicious!"}
{"text":"Here's my take:  The Pizza: - Thin crust, just a bit crispy on bottom, decent flavor; - The sauce is on the sparce side, and tastes like good tomato sauce, not too sweet; - The cheese is pretty standard, and was broiled until golden, which I like. - Overall, there's good flavor here, but it's a pretty standard pizza.  The Setting: - Cramped.  Your order at the counter, and folks waiting for carry out (must be most of their business) just kinda stand at the counter, too, so you don't know who is in line to order.  New folks walking in from the street can't get in the door. - The booths are 75% scale, like they're from England or something. - The employees think they are nice, but there is an edge of intolerance here for newbies. - Parking is very difficult - street only, and be prepared to stuff your car in front of a house and hoof it several blocks."}
{"text":"I really like Fiori's Pizzaria. It's one of the better pizza joints in Pittsburgh, that's for sure."}
{"text":"I had been told by a few people to try Fioris if I want good pizza. It wasn't worth the hype, to me. The prices were fair, the service was great, but the actual pizza flavor wasn't that great. The crust was crispy. The cheese was stringy, but thats about it. I had to add Parmesan cheese, garlic and salt. Personal preference but the sauce is really sweet and I prefer my sauce to have a little more zest to it.   I'd be willing to try something else from there but I'll keep going to my usual pizza place for now for my pizza fix."}
{"text":"Don't know what all the hype is about. Dough was soggy - slices collapsed as soon as you tried to pull them up. Mushrooms from a can, way too much cheese, tomato sauce tasted like it was from a can. Overpriced for quality as well IMO."}
{"text":"Top notch Pizza. The cheese they use here is absolutely amazing and the crust is probably the best I've ever had.  Very nice guys/gals working here, they are always so busy but always on the top of their game. Place is always packed and food comes out very quickly. I would recommend this place to any of yinz!"}
{"text":"Saw all the great ratings so I ended up checking this place out on two separate occasions during the evening. Bought two slices of pizza on the first go-around and two subs on the second go-around. Not really getting what the hype is about concerning their pizza since it tasted ... just like any generic pizza. Cheese was gooey, sauce was alright, crust was not too thin or thick ... essentially right in the middle of the mill. They definitely do have good subs/sandwiches that are worth getting though."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Fiori's sits on a stone path hill so it's best to park on the side of the building. There's only a few places to sit inside the restaurant. The person who took our order was very inviting and friendly.   After looking at how big the pizzas were, my fiance and I opted to share a small pepperoni pizza and it was delicious. Plenty of cheese on top so you'll see a cheese pull when picking up the slice. Being from Louisiana, I'm not used to the meat being under the cheese, but the spice of the pepperoni with the sweetness of the sauce made a tasty combination. There is a bit of grease on top of the pizza which we were fine with.   We also saw a lot of people getting the carton of Turner's Iced Lemon Tea and decided to try it. Although I'm not a fan of lemon flavored tea, this one is a must.   Overall, great taste and great pizza. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I had a change of scenery for my usual Friday night pizza run when I found myself commuting through the Far South Hills.  Luckily, I wasn't far from the new(er) Fiori's location!  I called ahead and placed my order and was told it would be 25 minutes.  I got there about 10 minutes after calling so I went in to pay and wait for my order.  The dining area is large and has plenty of tables for those that choose to dine in.  I could tell some people were at their first Fiori's rodeo because there were a couple groups just gawking at the menu trying to decide what sounded good (pro tip: ALL OF IT!).   I will point out that if the line gets a little long and people are standing around waiting for their pickup orders, it can be hard to figure out where to go when you get in here.  I made my way through the line and paid for my food (and of course the cup of cold cheese.  Try it. You're welcome.). I ended up waiting about 15 minutes past my scheduled pickup time and after being asked twice to remind them what my order was.  I've never had this happen at the Capital Ave. location, but considering how slammed this location was for 5:30 on a Friday night I was understanding of the situation. The pizza was great, although a bit skimpier on the pepperoni than my identical pie from the original location.  Overall it was still a damn good pizza and exactly what I've come to expect from the Fiori's name."}
{"text":"I heard such great things about Fiori's that when I was in the area I decided I had to try it. I have to say I was extremely disappointed and even troubled by the fact that other people had recommended it so highly. The ambiance was very nice and the staff was friendly but that was the only good thing about it. The pizza had no flavor! It was just straight up bland. Good texture crust, big chunky toppings, a nice amount of cheese but zero taste! Had to put all of the extras on it to make it resemble pizza- garlic powder, oregano, red peppers, salt and pepper! Maybe I'm spoiled coming from the city where we have Mineo's and Aiellos, but this experience just made me feel bad for the people in McMurray."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite slice in the Burgh.  Staff is pleasant, even when you roll in at 2:30am and they're slammed.  Service is always fast, and you can call your order in ahead of time so it's piping hot when you arrive.  Dine-in or carry-out only.    Spend the extra couple of bucks and get a side of cold cheese to top off your delicious slice of pizza heaven.  Something about it, I can't explain it, but it's magically delicious (sorry, Lucky Charms).  I'm sure someone will chime in with \"cold cheese? why not just go to Beto's?\"      If I wanted a bunch of cold stuff on a piece of bread, I'd make a sandwich.  Fiori's for the win."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my favorite places for Pizza in all of Pittsburgh!  When a pizza place does not have to deliver or even have a convenient place to park to pick up your carry out order, but is still slammed day in and out, it tells you something!  Secrets in the sauce!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Had enough parking, the friendliest staff, and amazing pizza!!! (I don't even like pizza and I love theirs)! Deffinately reccommend and they have a good amount of seating and serve beer . Portion sizes are huge for calzones!!"}
{"text":"Love the food!!!!! Small place though, and no parking... Deffinately better than their second location but both are good!!!!"}
{"text":"Love it! Get some cold cheese on the side for your pizza! The Italian  hoagie  is one of the best I've ever had. This place isn't just about pizza try some ravioli rigatoni  or spaghetti  it's all great!"}
{"text":"How am I a Pittsburgher and I have NOT rated Fiori's pizza until now? Geeze!  Well, as many other yelpers have already stated, Fiori's is darn good pizza. Sweeter sauce, generous toppings, delicious crust.. it's a real treat. Although I wouldn't call it the best pizza in the Burgh, it's definitely up there and it never disappoints. We order it a few times a year and enjoy every bite. Now that they have a parking lot, there's NO reason to not give this place a try asap!"}
{"text":"Massively overrated. I don't get it. Soggy crust and you need extra napkins to soak up the grease."}
{"text":"Soooo good, I just wish they delivered or the parking was easier.  Even though I live close it's so annoying to get to.  Definitely rivals Squirrel Hill pizza"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! The cheese, sauce and crust is very flavorful!  The only thing I'd wish they would do is have thinner crust instead of it being on the doughy, thicker side.  It's great tasting crust though :)  We love this pizza!"}
{"text":"tried twice because it's supposed to be so good. both times the pizza wasn't even luke warm. gross. won't be back."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the fuss was about. This was very basic pizza with nothing unique or memorable about it."}
{"text":"Fiori's is by far the best Pizza in Pittsburgh! I really don't know if much more to be said. This Pizza is one of the best I've had besides my own and I make a pretty good Pizza Pie. The location is small, and there isn't a lot of parking on the streets. But def worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to NY, Chicago, Rome and Venice. This is the best pizza in the world, I can assure you. Fresh cheese, sauce, dough and toppings everyday. Cash and no delivery, but certainly worth the trip."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza of all time!! So happy they opened the location in McMurray! Can't give reviews on any other food because all I eat is the pizza!"}
{"text":"I'm not even sure I need to post a review for this place as it's reputation pretty much precedes.... but regardless. Very, very good pizza. If I can offer anything-- LET THE PIZZA SIT a few minutes if you're able. Trust me, it changes everything! The only reason I didn't score this higher is because I'm not a fan of sweeter sauce, and this isn't a total sweet sauce, but sweet enough that I wouldn't put this ahead of Mineo's. All things considered, very good pizza. A buddy of mine had the italian hoagie, and enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"As far as pizza goes this is pretty, especially for it not being part of chain. (Ive become a bit of snob after working for one.) This place is small with lines that go out the door. Has a small sitting around with about 8 tables ;a fresh coat of paint wouldnt hurt this place. Menu has a lot to choose from with several toppings and sub sandwiches. The wait wasnt too long. The pizza itself is massive, about 16 in or little more. Not sure if I'd go out of my way to come back here. The hill the place is located on is killer! and there's practically no parking. But the pizza is pretty good. Very nice crust with just enough sauce and super cheesy!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh! So good. The sauce is slightly sweet which ILOVE! The amount of cheese they use is great and the crust is perfect. I crave it constantly. My boyfriend loves the cold cheese on the side. They don't deliver which is understandable to me because they would be insanely busy and it would probably take forever for them to get things done win employees constantly driving deliveries. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Double crust: Just when I thought Fiori's couldn't be any better, somebody told me to order my pizza with a double crust, or thick crust. It's just too good to describe in words. It's not super thick like Sicilian, but you definitely have a thicker crust than the regular Fiori's pizza, which is totally delicious on its own.  The rivalry for best Pittsburgh pizza typically gets booked as Mineo's versus Aiello's, but Fiori's in Dormont is hands down Numero Uno. Here's why- The sauce is seasoned, slightly sweet, and applied in perfect proportion. The cheese is top quality, and again applied in perfect proportion. The toppings are top-quality, again applied in perfect proportion. But really the ultimate deciding factor is the crossed-which is far superior to any other pizza crust in Pittsburgh.  Why my emphasis on proportions? Because Mineos puts up so I would pound of pizza cheese on their large pizza, it's no jokes nearly a quarter of an inch of pizza cheese. Aiellos (my number 2 choice because of their garlic sauce) marinara sauce is just too sweet.   Also the Italian salad at Fiori's is delicious. Definitely worth getting to accompany your pizza."}
{"text":"Yum. Best pizza ever. You know it's good when theres an actual line on a Sunday at 8p!!"}
{"text":"My first stop in Pittsburgh, I really enjoyed the food here. The cheese pizza was amazing probably some of the best I've had. The pizza I had with topping were just added on. Id prefer it to be cooked on the pizza instead. But I actually just slide them to the side and enjoyed the pizza. Also the wings were damn good and weren't tiny. Stop by for a cut or two."}
{"text":"This is the same little pizza shop where they filmed the movies \"Blind Fiori\" and \"The Fast And The Fiori-us.\" So make sure you grab a slice for your girlfriend, wife, sister, mother, daughter, Aunt or ant. Because hell hath no Fiori like a woman without pizza.  What to get: A slice with a pot of white cheese on the side Why: Because I just said the word \"pot\" and you thought of drugs and that says a lot about you Like in a bad way?: I'm not here to pass judgment, I'm just here to pass the ball to Antwaan Randle-El.  How to improve: Offer a range of different slices rather than just cheese.  I was fiori fiori impressed with Fiori's from the first time I tried it, over 10 years ago.  They're open super late at night, but coming here after 11pm is a little creepy, especially in winter. The roads in these parts are silent and dead. The towering hills blink down at you as you go through the tunnel or along the winding lanes. When you finally find this little spot, on a steep cobbled side street that leads up to nowhere, it's next to a dive bar and a silent gas station. You might see the Pittsburgh version of a tumbleweed blow by. Be brave and head on in for the best slice in town.  It's the kind of pizza that, if it were on the other side of a river, you'd take a fiori across just to get it.  To this day, it remains the only Pizzeria that calls itself a Pizzaria, in my experience. It's also the best slice in Pittsburgh, a little ahead of Aiello's, Pizza Italia and Fazio's, which are 3 other similar slices, which complete the \"quadfecta\" of the best slices in a town that has very unique pizza.  Einstein knew all about this pizza. It's where he came up with his Fiori of Relativity.  It's unique in how bland and plain and simple it is. It's all about the extra-floury extra-white dough, and the small amounts of sauce and conservative layer of cheese. It actually works though. No other city makes pizza like Pitt, and when I'm in town I rarely miss the opportunity to enjoy one of these slices of heaven.  This was the first slice in space (Fiori Gagarin), so that in itself is a reason to try it.  I heard a long time ago that you should ask for a pot of white cheese on the side. They don't seem to be too familiar with the concept, but they gladly do it and it's pretty cheap. The white cheese is yum, and goes well with the already cheesy, slightly-dry pizza. I recommend getting a drink with your slice.  Also, full disclosure: I often get this pizza for a girl to try and seduce her. It's my form of Fioriplay."}
{"text":"Fiori's has been one of my favorite pizza places in Pittsburgh, having eaten at the hole-in-the-wall South Hills location for several years.  I was excited to see this new, dressed up restaurant in Peters Township, and suggested to a group of friends we eat there for lunch since we were already in the area for an event.  The four of us ordered two small pies to share, but I was completely mortified I made the suggestion as soon as I saw our friends' pizza. They ordered a plain cheese, and there was literally a puddle of grease sitting on top of it. I understand pizza is greasy, but this was excessive. I could've tipped this pizza over a sink and had a small grease waterfall going. It took at least a dozen napkins for them to sop up what they were served, but still ended up eating a soggy mess.  Perhaps my friends were trying to be polite in eating it, but if it were my pizza I would've sent it back to the kitchen, something I rarely do. I didn't understand how the wait staff could carry that pizza to our table with a straight face. We mentioned it as he served it, but didn't seem to think much of it.  I still love Fiori's, but I don't think I'll come back to this location. The pizza here barely resembled the Fiori's I know and love."}
{"text":"Top 5 pizza in Pittsburgh. The only thinkg I don't like about it is the toppings slide off."}
{"text":"Wow!   This is very good pizza.   I used a competing delivery service (doordash) and ordered a Meatball, Onion, and Mushroom Pizza and a dozen hot wings.  Fiori's Pizzaria was like finding a Unicorn.   I have heard so much about it from life long residents but never had the opportunity to visit myself.  The previous reviews were correct (they live up to the street hype).   Wings - the wings were warm, had great flavor, and great texture (I don't like soggy chicken wings that you usually get from pizzerias.)  The pizza -  The crust tasted as if it was made that day.   I have mad a pie or two in my life from scratch.  The pizza crust had the texture and flavor than any that I made personally (maybe I am a bad pizza maker).   It passed my stand test (I am against droopy pizza slices), was airy and chewy.  The Sauce - The sauce was thick (not runny like you will find on cheaper pizzas) surprisingly not acidic.   My opinion but when you see a thick sauce it is usually very acidic.   Fiori's did a great job of avoiding traps (adding sugar and making the sauce too sweet thus removing the acidity).    The Ingredients - They all tasted fresh and was the correct amount.   Mushrooms looked fresh (not canned), onions were fresh, and the meatballs were dispersed across the pizza.  A high recommend if you are in the 'burgh."}
{"text":"I only come to Pittsburgh twice a year, but I get so excited to eat the best pizza. Sacramento pizzarias have nothing on Pittsburgh's. Fiori's is the best pizza I've ever eaten. It's local so my dad grew up eating the stuff & so did I until I moved to California. Sweet sauce and thin crust baked to perfection. If you're in Pittsburgh, you must try it. If you live in Pittsburgh, then you already know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"I have just been there today (Monday) for the first time. I called and placed an order of 6 wings and a slice of cheese pizza for take out. When I got there 11:45 am the place was already packed. I told them I forgot to tell them I wanted garlic parm of wings  when I ordered.  They said if you don't choose  flavor they automatically make buffalo. That was  fine with me since it was my fault not mentioning it. They asked me if I could wait for 15 min while they re make my wings.  I didnt want to wait so I asked them to just add butter and parm on my wings which they kindly did for me. After I got home I opened the package. There were 8 PCs of wings. How sweet of them !!!  The pizza and wings were very good. I will definitely go  back to order my favorite garlic parm next time."}
{"text":"Eat at Fioris, they said.  Youll like it, they said.  is it conveniently located on West Liberty Boulevard, this restaurant features absolutely nowhere to park on the road that is impossible to get to.  When I called to place our order a miserable sounding me an answer the phone with the side and then said what do you need? I placed our order and he said don't come down here it's going to be at least an hour to we can get to you if my coworkers can do anything right. That was really unprofessional. Some people may think that character but really I don't care what kind of a day the person taking the pizza order is having I just want to place my order without feeling im bothering them,  You should know that you will have to illegally parked your car to pick your order up.  the place was filthy inside and it was packed full of people and total mayhem. I would never ever recommend eating in store even if the place was clean up you're still going to have people waiting to pick three orders of standing right over you. It was also about a hundred degrees in there. They also only take cash with they didn't mention and there was no sign so I was glad I had cash on hand.  I knew that something was up with the pizza 13 started leaking through the lid of the pizza as we were driving it home. The bottom and the top rated with grease. How does that even happen? My friend said that's a sign of a great pizza but he is a guy and we have other eating priorities it was disgusting. You're not supposed to take a slice of pizza up out of the pizza box and have all of the toppings slide off due to thebgrease.  the only restaurant that could get away with pizza that greasy is Vincents and they are now gone..you could caulk a bathtub with the cheese that's how rubbery it was. It was disgusting. the red sauce tasted like it was ketchup with sugar added. It was gross I don't understand why anybody likes this restaurant but the poor service and the poor quality of the food is a prime example of a restaurant resting on the laurels of its legacy."}
{"text":"My fave pizza near the burgh.  The sauce is so unique... it's sweet and delicious.  I like the wings here too.  I don't know why.  I just like the combo of hot wing sauce with sweet pizza sauce.  Located in a weird spot up a hill, near a feisty local bar."}
{"text":"The only thing Fiori's needs to add to make it perfect is online ordering through Yelp or Grubhub!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best in the burgh' Mineo's has to come in second   The pizza has a sweet sauce, the dough is fresh, and the cheese is top notch. Fiori's is open late and is always packed with people. Grab a seat, and proceed to make sweet love to this pizza!  T"}
{"text":"The pizza is super greasy but it really is some of the best. Most cheap pizza in Pittsburgh tastes like cardboard and everyone seems to like it. Fiori's is actually worth tasting. I don't have to put toppings on it in order to stomach eating it- that's the true mark of a good pizza! The sandwiches are decent as well, but I've never tried the pasta or any apps. Large plain cheese pizza is my favorite here."}
{"text":"I grew up in North Jersey, so I am a huge Pizza snob!!  New York pizza is the best!!!  Chicago what?!?   With that in mind I was pleasantly surprised to discover Fiori's.  The place is under the radar, not on a main strip.  There are a few parking spots available, but take out is your best bet!   When I went, I got a slice, or a \"cut\" as they called it.  My husband got pepperoni and I got cheese.  It was ready pretty quickly and we sat at the bar stools to eat.  It was definitely cheesy with a great crust!  The sauce was tasty too.  The only thing I would do next time I went was to ask for it \"well done.\"  Dont get me wrong, the pizza was hot, but a few more minutes would have given it that browned top and just a little crisper bottom crust. (Which I personally like)  I am definitely going back!  If you are looking for New York style pizza I would give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I have heard thousands of times that this is one of the best pizza shops in Pittsburgh...... And I finally got to try it!  My hubby & I decided to drive over and order a pie and a sub to go. We got a pepperoni, sausage & extra cheese pizza and a whole Italian sub with extra meat. It didn't take very long for everything to be cooked and I tell you what, my car filled with the most delicious smells of cheese & meat while I drove home. I was excited to finally get home and bite into pizza heaven!  I was NOT disappointed!!!  Delicious!  Definitely agree with everyone who told me it's one of the best pizza places around!    The meat and extra cheese on my pie was perfect. The crust was just crunchy enough. And the sauce was on that sweet side!  I haven't had a pizza with a sweeter sauce anywhere else around here. It was delightful!!!  I hope I go back sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the 'Burgh thus far.  Do not let the place scare you, as some of the best food I have had has come out of old, out of date looking places in questionable neighborhoods.  Fiori's has awesome crust, sauce and amazing thick pepperoni.  Even though they are cash only, they are worth thew trip to the ATM and it is apparent that a lot of other people agree with me as on a week night, all of the tables were taken and there was a long and consistently moving line of people coming in for their take out orders.  I will definitely be back to Fiori's and I appreciate the recommendation from the friend who first turned me on to this yummy hidden little gem."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in town! When I first moved here it's actually all I kept hearing about and I can see why! Unfortunately they don't deliver but that's ok since they're open till late and serve such great pizza. Pizza I'm more than willing to drive to lol."}
{"text":"Maybe the best pizza in Pittsburgh. If you want to see how pizza is supposed to taste give them a try. If you live near them and you haven't tried their pizza you probable live under a rock and don't deserve this delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Bland, nothing special sauce. If you like pizza just for the cheese, you'll love Fioris. There's lots of cheese. The crust is crisp, often burnt. The Italian sub we got had so little Italian dressing, it was more of a cold-cut sandwich. No bathrooms?!? If there is one, it's in the back, past the sign that says no entry, so not very public-friendly. No refills on fountain drinks, higher prices,  really cheap napkins good for nothing, and terrible on-street, on a hill parking round out this place. The only reason I gave them three stars is my husband liked it more than I did."}
{"text":"I feel like such a failure because I didn't try their pizza. My friend and a group of her friends invited me here. They all spilt 2 pizzas but since I didnt have cash to pitch in , I opted to order my own food on card. I ordered 6 wings- bbq. ($4+) and fries($3). Loved both of them. I expected small wing dings and frozen fries but wings were a great size and fries were good. Still need to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"As a Colorado native transplant and Bronco fan, this is the real deal.....New York style in da burgh. the little hole in the wall Bar next door owns Fiori's as is way cool. You can bring your Pizza over and have a cold one while you watch local yokels in Steelers t-shirts play pool and talk about past glory's gone by!"}
{"text":"This pizza is so good, and you can get an order of wings cheap too. I think it's the best pizza in the south hills easy, if not the city. I have to stop in at least every other week for pizza, it's good enough to make you crave it."}
{"text":"This is a quality slice. Crispy and flavorful but not as good as Mineo's. Definitely worth a try and was busy for sit down and takeout."}
{"text":"The best pizza in the burgh! I was raised form New York and a very particular taste for pizza. While this isn't new York style it is very good. The only one that rivals the taste is Pizza Sola. The crust is thin and the cheese is creamy. It has a great flavor. My only problem is that it's cash only! It's the 21 century get with the program!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine calls this the best pizza in Pittsburgh.  I disagree, but it's definitely up there with some of the best.  Maybe top three?  Everything was quick, and the pizza was good.  Sadly, there's not much of a story here, or any room to expand.  Therefore, a short review.    Oh yeah, holy crap steep hill for parking on! You could probably park elsewhere, though... I didn't know what I was doing, so I climbed the hill a bit and parked in that neighborhood."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing. I was a little overwhelmed with three little cousins in tow, so my pick-up order discombobulated and unclear. The staff were patient & accommodating despite being busy during noon-day rush. It was a great Sunday after-church meal & I'm so glad I found Fiori's!!!"}
{"text":"What do all these reviews add up to? You've gotta try it. GO!"}
{"text":"I love pizza and this is AMAZING!! It has a sweeter sauce (which I love!)...  and great mozzarella cheese... I order the pizza well done because it is a little softer and that makes it much better! I dare someone to try this and not love it... The workers and always super fast and completely on top of everything... The only downfall is that the pizza is a little more expensive over other pizza places... but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Service is just okay--they are rude short with you. No parking. On a brick road that will have your car shaking the whole time. You will get your car swiped if you aren't careful. The cheese blend is good. The sauce is sweet: not slightly sweet, but sweet. There is a lot of appeal to Fioris because of the sauce. I guess I prefer something savory in my sauce and find the aggravation to make it less worthwhile than Mineo's in Mt. Lebanon"}
{"text":"Fiori's is the best pizza I have ever had & I can't believe some of these people that have given negative reviews!! I don't know how some of the other pizza places near by even stay in business with fioris in the area!! I love this pizza & I wish they would open up more locations so even more people could enjoy this wonderful pizza!"}
{"text":"We ordered a large pizza half with pepperoni it was $20bucks w/drinks, Over half the tables were taken and would say the atmosphere was what you would expect from a pizza place. It took a while for the pizza but as soon as it was sat down I grabbed a slice and stuffed it in my mouth, (bad Idea) since I burned the top of my mouth, but that was my own dumb fault. The pizza was a good size. it was good and when the Italian fellow asked me how it was I said great.  Went in  the back to use the restroom, you have to go thru what I think was the back part of the kitchen to get there,and it was nice to see how clean everything looked. Certainly will go back."}
{"text":"That pizza was good I had to tell the lady at the hotel thank you for that Recommendation love the pizza done just right"}
{"text":"A favorite of mine and almost  everyone I know for the past 20yrs. The employee s are great too. Try a pie with the fennel sausage or capicola which is always my go to toppings."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh!!! People who don't know about Fiori's pizza shop always ask \"what kind of pizza shop doesn't deliver?\"   And I always answer \"THE KIND THE DOESN'T HAVE TO!!!\" (If you haven't tried Fiori's pizza, do yourself a favor and go and get some, you'll thank me for it)"}
{"text":"Why didn't I come here before?  This was the only thought going through my head as I downed my cheese slice.This is currently my favorite slice in Pittsburgh, very similar to some great pizza I had in the Bronx. Other reviewers mentioned a slightly sweet tomato sauce and crust, and I didn't feel the sweetness was remarkable. It wasn't too salty, and the cheese was fresh.   There's a few tables and some old-skool arcade games. There's an ATM inside the establishment."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since I was 6 years old and every time we come back into town to visit this is the first stop we make. Incredible and best pizza, hoagies and food anywhere."}
{"text":"There is a certain style of pizza - thin floppy crust, tons of cheese - so much cheese grease pools on top, sweet sauce.  Totally different than chains like Pizza Hut or Papa John's.  I can't explain it, but there is only one other place that I've eaten this type of pizza in the college town where I did my undergrad (Subs n' Suds, Indiana, PA).  It's my most favorite kind.  No toppings, just cheese.  Simple, greasy, simple.  Fiori's pizza is fantastic.  The only complaint I have is parking on that stupid hill - I nearly had a heart attack trying to parallel park up a 45 degree incline.   Service is as fast as it can be, but they seem to work efficiently.  Super nice too.  We eat here as often as we happen to stumble over to the other side of the Liberty Tubes, which isn't often enough."}
{"text":"The unassuming little pizzeria packs a serious punch. The menu boasts not only pizza, but also calzones, hoagies, garlic bread and a whole host of sides.   We opted for the pizza and weren't disappointed. The crust is just right - thin and crispy - and the sauce has a hint of spice and sweetness. Probably the best pizza I've had in the city, and will definitely come back on my next visit."}
{"text":"This is seriously the best pizza that I've ever had in my entire life that's saying a lot since I'm pushing 40 and I've been a pizza connoisseur and pushing 300 pounds since high school. Lol I spend a lot of time around Chicago and Brooklyn for business but I can tell you that nothing touches this place!"}
{"text":"If you like thick, bready pizza dough, this place is definitely for you. I ordered two slices with capicola and red and green peppers. The slices were ENORMOUS and way more than enough food for one person, honestly each slice was about two slices. The capicola was absolutely delicious and the sauce was great, if a little sweet. Slightly too light on the cheese for my liking, but this was likely due to the fact that I ordered by the slice. Extremely reasonable pricing.  Odd setup- seems like it should have wait staff, but you order and then sit down. I will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"This is a 5 star pizza place period. There is no better pizza in the world.   I live in California and when I'm in Pittsburgh I always stop here.   I recommend the cheese pizza. Fiori's uses the best and freshest ingredients. Their cheese pizza is very flavorful. Adding anything else to the pizza takes away from the crust, sauce and cheese.   Caution let the pie cool down a bit. It comes out burning hot.   The subs are good here too.  They've get a line out the door. They must be doing something right."}
{"text":"Good old fashioned pizza! Definitely go if you like a cheesy greasy pizza! Very clean and inviting dining room. They also sell Coke a cola products and Pepsi via bottles for those who lol Pepsi products with their pizza"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Not a better place to stop and grab a quick slice in the city. True NY style pizza. Best part is it's really cheap! I'm in and out for $5 every time. I wish they delivered!!"}
{"text":"We get take-out from here every so often to eat while we watch a Penguins or Steelers game at home, and as soon as we eat the food, we end up cursing ourselves for not choosing this pizza shop more often.  I always get the small tossed salad- it is a pretty big salad with iceberg mix, tomatoes, cucumbers, diced white onions, black olives, and loads of shredded mozzarella on top. For dressing, they make the Italian dressing in-house (it's pretty good but tastes better on a hoagie than a salad) but the other dressings, including the ranch dressing, are Marzettis packets, which I think is a great-tasting dressing. The veggies are always fresh and I have never been disappointed in this salad.  The meatball hoagie is also awesome- the meatballs are huge and the bread is toasted which is nice because otherwise the sauce would soak through and cause a messy sandwich. A half hoagie is more than enough for a meal so we normally split it and get buffalo wings (for him) and salad (for me).  Let me tell you, my SO is obsessed with all things hot sauce and wings. He gets them at practically every restaurant we go to, and these buffalo wings are THE BEST, without a doubt. The buffalo sauce is to die for and the wings are crunchy and delicious! They even sell the buffalo sauce to-go if you just cannot get enough. You HAVE to get buffalo wings here-  you won't regret it!  One thing that lacks is the parking. Not that it is in their control, but you will have a really tough time trying to find parking as they are on the corner of West Liberty and a steep brick hilly road that is always full on one side with people parallel-parked for the pizza shop or bar next door. We typically park at the gas station next door to them and buy some drinks for our meal so we don't feel so bad about using their lot for a few minutes. Don't let that stop you from eating here; it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"This is a dive.  A true dive.  The lack of pretentiousness and extraneous decor in the building are mirrored in the food that you get here.  I would recommend staying away during popular hours due to the fact that the parking is somewhat difficult -- the scant parking is on the side of the building and on the side of the road going up the steep hill.    It really doesn't matter if you will be dining in or carrying out, you need to walk to the counter first to place your order.  If you have more than one person in your group, all the better since they can be on the look-out for a coveted table.  Once you order, pay for it.  On my first time here, I sat down and waited to be served -- they won't come.  I then ordered at the counter and was given the option of paying before or after the meal and I chose after -- the people making the food will assume you haven't arrived and will go slow in the preparation, PAY!  With the niceties out of the way, you can focus on finding a table or just sit back and relax if someone in your crew already found one.  I have been here twice already and these people just don't stop.  It is a well-greased assembly line that only lets you down if you don't follow the proper path (look at the above paragraph).  Both times I contented myself to watch the large numbers of people that enter through this pizza parlours doors while we waited on our order:  First Trip only: Garlic bread Hot wings  Both Trips: Meatballs (x2) and red sauce Pepperoni Pizza with Extra Cheese (12\" - 8 cut)  The meatballs, wings, and bread came out rather quickly.  The garlic bread was nothing special, just a loaf brushed with a garlic oil and warmed.  Very simple, but somewhat weak in the garlic department.  The buffalo wings were good.  They were not hot/piquant; but they actually had good flavor and that is really what counts.  They were slightly more acidic than many of the wings that I have had in the area and that went well with a little bit of blue cheese.  The meatballs were about the size of a racketball.  Very little to no seasoning in both the sauce and the meatballs.  I was quite surprised to find that I enjoyed them.  The small number of ingredients that go into making this simple sauce and meatball had to be in proper proportion each time to get that wonderful flavor -- so far they are batting 2/2.    Our pizza arrived steaming hot and smelling wonderful.  I could tell from the small bits of brown that were beginning in the cheese that the pizza had been cooked fully and to the proper temperature.  There is nothing worse than a pizza that is pulled too soon.  I ate my first piece and was amazed at the flavors.  The pizza, overall, had a sweet undertone.  As I started on my second piece, I began to take more note of the flavors.  The crust had a slightly sweet flavor, was a tad doughy/soft, but was super thin and had a very good flavor.  The sauce was also sweet; it tasted like the sauce that came with the meatballs.  Tasting the pepperoni, again there was this sweet undertone to it.    I must say, I am not usually a fan of sweet foods, but this wasn't unnaturally sweet and it was tasting good.  What amazed me the most was the near-perfect execution of the pizza with so few ingredients and none of the usual and stereotypical Italian seasonings.  Yeah, I enjoyed this pizza.  It is definitely the best I have had in Pittsburgh.  I will be returning for my pizza fix again and again and again...    They only accept cash, if you have none there is a convenient ATM near the singles/kiddie bar.  They are open until 3am on the weekends, so if you get a late night hankering for pizza you are in luck.  Just be advised you will have to then battle the post-bar crowd.  NOTE:  If you must have the Italian seasoning, you won't like this pizza.  Also, be careful of ordering too many toppings or extra cheese as the crust is so thin and has a hard time holding it up -- not an issue if you eat with a fork."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Pittsburgh's best pizza?! The crust is thin, the sauce sweet. Pepperonis are under the cheese. I could eat an 8 cut by myself. This place is popular and gets busy. I suggest calling ahead to place your order if you want to dine in. Parking is difficult, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"There's little that needs to be said about Fiori's at this point. A local South Hills legend, it's pretty much perfection.  If a place can make me go to an ATM for cash (they don't accept cards,) that's a sign that it's GOOD STUFF! :)"}
{"text":"Hands-down this is one of the best pizza shops in Pittsburgh from the cheese the dough the sauce all the ingredients are fresh and I have never been disappointed there yet never any surprises they are consistent and always delicious."}
{"text":"Their cheese pizza is a must have if you're visiting Pittsburgh. Period. It's where all the locals go and you should too!"}
{"text":"What a Pittsburgh tradition and treat...I stop here everytime I come back to the Burgh...thank you Fiori!"}
{"text":"THIS is an old-school pizza shop!  I'm sure that many of the foodie-types who frequent Yelp are going to dismiss this place, but having heard so much about it from my local pizza-loving friends about the pie at Fiori's, I finally decided to stop and order a couple of pizzas to go while I was in the neighborhood.  The sauce definitely isn't for everyone - it's a departure from the typical corporate pizza crap that everyone has gotten used to.  But the sauce is INTERESTING, and the crust is PERFECT.  A little too much flour used when it was flown, but I'm guessing that's because the place was doing such a high volume of business.  The pepperoni reminds me of the old Mineo's pizza, small slices that curl up and produce little grease pools.  WOW, now that's the pepperoni I love, and definitely not the pepperoni you'll find at Papa John's, or Vocelli's, or Domino's, or Little Caesar's, or Pizza Hut.  This is the PIZZA of your youth - the pizza you remember your dad bringing home, complete with the relic-style pizza box.  It's not in my neighborhood, and I'm lucky enough to live close to Luciano's, but if I'm hungry and in the vicinity of Fiore's any time soon, I won't hesitate to grab a couple more pies - maybe one for dinner and one for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for takeout pizza. They have some great choices and don't skimp on the toppings, and I've never been disappointed with a pizza I've had from here"}
{"text":"Definitely our favorite pizza! Have eaten here several times with our family and we have not been disappointed once. The food is great! The location is convenient and easy to get in and out of!  It is clean and the service is great too!"}
{"text":"I am a bit of a pizza snob and this area is littered with pizza places, most of whom are nothing worth writing about. This pizza, however, is excellent.  The sauce is rich without being overpowering. I have had two pizzas here and the crust on both was delicious and cooked perfectly. The cheese and toppings were well balanced and fresh. Not too greasy but enough for you to appreciate it :-)"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Tuesday evening with my wife and a friend for dinner.  We arrived shortly after 7 PM to find this place absolutely packed.  That meant that there wasn't any good parking spots available and so we had to park halfway up Capital Ave which if you don't know is a very steep cobblestone road.  The good news for us upon entering is that we were able to snag a table which was great as it seemed like people were waiting for tables the whole time that we were there.  The inside of Fiori's is somewhat small and I think they have 4 booths and 3 tables for seating as well as a pinball machine in one of the corners.  On this night our party decided to be simple and we ordered two large cheese pizzas for our table.  After taking a seat we probably waited around 20 minutes or so before our pizzas were ready for us.  The pizza ended up being pretty good and I can see why people in the South Hills always rave about Fioris.  My favorite part of it ended up being the crust which I thought had a really good crisp and a somewhat sweet flavor to it.  The cheese was also really good and there was a ton of it. Last but not least was the sauce whose flavor seemed to get lost with the cheese and crust.  So overall it was a pretty good pizza with my only complaint being that I could not for the life of me get the cheese to stay on the pizza while I was eating it.  Every time I took a bite or tried to cut it all of the cheese seemed to come off the rest of the slice.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I really enjoyed both the sweetness and crispiness of the crust and thought that there cheese was good as well.  Now if they can only do something about the parking situation outside."}
{"text":"I am new to the area and looking for that one pizza place that I fall in love with. After reading the reviews I thought this may be it, it's not. First off parking is impossible which isn't a huge deal. I ordered a pizza and an Italian sausage hoagie. The pizza is a hot  mess. You open the box and that's what it looks like. Just thrown together with no care at all. I love cheese but the amount of cheese they put on is ridiculous. I guess they do this to cover the taste of the non existing crust. This pizza felt like I was eating a pound of cheese mixed with sauce. The pizza is a 1.5 stars max.  The Italian sausage I really enjoyed. Again way to much cheese. Seriously, what's the deal with all the freaking cheese! Anyways the sausage  had a great texture and taste to it. Just the right amount of peppers and the hoagie was soft and had a great feel to it. I give it a 4.  I may give the pizza another try. It was a Friday night, they were very busy and maybe just rushed. I will probably go back to try the other hoagies."}
{"text":"Pizza. The way to my heart. I heard stories of Fiori's greatness from far and wide. Finally I got my hands on its goodness.  Bar none the best BEST pizza in the Burgh. Maybe the best I've ever had. The cheese is amazing, the sauce is just a little too sweet, and the crust is always perfect. Get some cold cheese on the side and dig in!!   Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza ever!!!   It is the greatest ratio of cheese to crust and sauce. It's a great sauce, a little sweet I'd say and it's perfect to load up with red pepper flakes and extra parm   I've not been to the new location but I love the original. Nothing fancy, just focusing on the pizza! Complete with metal plates and pizza trays. They also have a tv which usually plays sports games, some arcade games and you can buy t shirts for $15 folks! If that's your thing this would be a great shirt.   Parking can be tricky. Beware of high curbs and garages.   One employee today even gave us a tip on how to pack left over pizza in the box best  thanks, buddy! (Use the corners!!)    We don't live in the area but any time we visit we try to hit up flori's!!   Love it!"}
{"text":"We got the pepperoni and green pepper pizza with thick crust. It was AMAZING. The pepperoni was the best I have ever had in any pizza and the bell peppers were thinly sliced and cooked to perfection. My only complaint is I didn't care too much for the crust. It was a little bland to me but my husband loved it. I would recommend to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza but  I don't like the inside seating and that they are cash only."}
{"text":"hard to find parking but the pizza and sandwiches are really good and not greasy.  they sell slices of pizza and its really good the cheese taste like its high quality and kinda sweet. its cheap to and the sandwiches come in 2 sizes i ordered the smaller version and it was still too big. the portions are huge."}
{"text":"Ok, Fiori's, I've been hearing about your delicious pizza for years and finally got to try it!  I was not disappointed at all and will certainly order again when I'm in the area.    Great crust, not to heavy or overbearing, and a good ratio of cheese to sauce and toppings.  I'm picky about pizza and I'd be hard pressed to complain about these pies.  Definitely in my top five of favorite Pittsburgh pizzas!"}
{"text":"Fiori's pizza is amazing! When my husband and I first moved to Pittsburgh over four years ago, we rented a home in Brookline. As soon as coworkers learned where I lived, they said, \"You have to try Fiori's.\"   We would order Fiori's for any occasion... from a quiet don't-feel-like-cooking Tuesday night to a big birthday party. Though takeout is great, I highly recommend eating in the restaurant. The pizza tastes even more incredible when eaten immediately.  Fiori's pizza has a sweet, doughy crust that tastes a little extra crispy when eaten immediately vs. doughier when taken home. The sauce is also sweet, and the pizza is covered in a thick layer of cheese. Don't make the mistake of ordering toppings. Any Fiori's lover knows that you eat Fiori's with just the cheese.  Mmm... even thinking about their pizza makes me crave it. Plus, the good news is that they've recently opened a second location and now take credit cards! Hopefully, they continue to expand within the Pittsburgh area and introduce people outside of the south hills to their delicious product."}
{"text":"I wish I could give half stars because I would give this place 4.5. The cheese on this pizza is to die for!!!! I don't know what combination they use but it was so good!! We got the pizza to go and traveled about 10 minutes and it was still hot when we got home. I wasn't able to make it to my favorite pizza place in the Burgh this trip but Fiori's definitely made up for my craving!! It's a cracker crust...not too thin but not too thick. The sauce is the only thing that was just okay..but the pizza was still delicious!! I will go back for sure when I'm in the area!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza but unlike the original location which is always and I mean always great the new location is a little hit or miss. I'm sure this comes with having new cooks and such but when it's good it's great just like the original location."}
{"text":"I hardly ever gallivant in the South Hills, but it was a rare weekend where I found myself having crossed a river and in need of nourishment. My trusty Yelp app told me that apparently some of the best pizza in Pittsburgh could be had at this little storefront in Beechview, so I decided to give it a whirl.  First thing's first. As other reviewers have noted, it appears that parking is a pain here. It's located at the bottom of what looks to be a death trap of a cobblestone hill where you need to find a street spot and then hope your parking brake doesn't fail you. However, Fiori's does have like 3 off-street spots directly beside the building...fortune must've smiled upon us that day, because we were able to snag one of those.  The inside is quite small and adorably old school. You can see the workers tossing pizza dough and firing up your food in their ovens, which I always love to watch. There are like 3 tables and maybe 4 booths in here, and this place is POPULAR. We went at 2pm on a Saturday and there wasn't a table to be had (and many people waiting). It's open seating, so if you come during a peak time, you've just got to shark a table and hope you get lucky (again, we somehow were fortunate and happened to be standing by a table that left right as our food came out, so we were able to jump on it).   You order at the counter, and they bring your food to you. We got some cheese sticks to start and then split a small pizza. Now, usually cheese sticks are cheese sticks and all taste about the same, but these were notably good! I don't know if they are homemade, but they sure tasted like it. The breading was different than a typical from-the-bag-of-frozen type of cheese stick. The dipping sauce was unique...like a puree with no chunks (I actually prefer chunky marinara with my sticks, but this was still tasty).  As for the pizza, heed my advice: wait a couple of minutes before digging in. Both my husband and I destroyed the roof of our mouths because we didn't realize how hot the pizza was. It literally comes straight from the oven to your table (which is awesome, but I'm apparently too much of a fat ass to realize that I needed to wait for it to cool off). Second-degree burns notwithstanding, the pizza was tasty! This is the type of pizza that you definitely need to dab with a few napkins beforehand to soak up all of the grease that is oozing from it. They definitely don't skimp on the cheese! The sauce is thin and has just a hint of sweetness. And the crust is crispy...the kind of crust that gives you that delightful crunch when you bite into it. That's a nice change from the standard chewy crust that a lot of pizza shops in Pittsburgh seem to go with.  Is it the best pizza in Pittsburgh, like many reviewers claim? Well, pizza is subjective. It was definitely tasty and I'd go back the next time I'm in the neighborhood. But I have yet to find pizza in Pittsburgh that seems worthy of the \"Best Of\" title. Fiori's, however, certainly holds its own."}
{"text":"Love fioris pizza. Always add cold cheese. Their subs are great too. Never had a bad meal here"}
{"text":"Most pizza places in the McMurray/Peters area are garbage. Fioris is hands down the best around. Ask for your pizza well done and you can't go wrong. Also the home made provolone sticks are the bomb. Steak hoagies are great too with their special sauce.   Weekends can be crazy sometimes so make sure if you want Fiori's for dinner on a Friday to call it in early. When they tell you it's going to be an hour and a half wait, they mean it. So be prepared to wait for the best pizza you've ever had. That place gets jam packed on weekends.    Glad to finally have some good Italian food in Washington county."}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza I've ever had. Since moving to Canonsburg, I was extremely worried that all I saw was Pizza Hut - then a quick Yelp search led me here!  They only do pick up or eat in, as far as I know. They might deliver to houses closer than mine, but the drive is every bit worth it. I've called in multiple times. My pizza is always hot & ready as soon as I get there. Employees have always been friendly.  The menu is extremely basic. Pizza and hoagies. No frills and they don't need it!  Their crust isn't too thick or thin. They're generous with toppings but the best thing about their pizza is the sauce. It's a sweet sauce and by far my favorite.  The only reason they lose a star is their hoagies. They left A LOT to be desired compared to the pizza."}
{"text":"Looking for good pizza in the 'burgh? Well, you just found the best.  Fiori's is one pizza shop that we go out of our way for. Their pies are always fresh right from the oven and you can see the crew make every one. There is some seating in the spot, but it can fill up fast on a Saturday night.  The pizzas are great just on their own with no toppings, but if you want to jazz it up the toppings are fresh and super tasty. You can even order a side of mozzarella to put on top of your slice! The hoagies are also fairly large and enough for at least two to share. I've tried the steak hoagie previously and instead of a white/cheese sauce it comes with a red \"secret\" sauce which is really good.  So the next time you're looking for pizza, stop by Fiori's for a pie that will leave you coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Seriously? Fiori's in McMurray?? It's the same awesome pizza you get in Beechview, but now in a large, contemporary location on Rt 19. If you've been to the Beechview location, this place is exactly the opposite inside-- clean, bright, modern and new. Go get some pizza!"}
{"text":"My stepfather-in-law gave me sage advice about finding good pizza. If you don't know the pizza in an area, look for the dirtiest, rundown place you can find, and you'll find the best pizza in town. The thinking behind that is, if the place looks that bad but is still in busines, then there is a reason they're still in business. And in my experiences, it's almost always true.  Fiori's is a dive (in a good way)- the inside looks like it was put together in the '70's, and the staff isn't always the friendliest. Forget about parking- there are three spots on the side of the building and perilious street parking on the hill. The later in the evening you go, the busier the dining room. My suggestion is don't eat here- you're only asking for drama.  But then you get home with that steaming pie, and all the parking nonsense, questionable customer service, and wait in line vanishes as you're enveloped in cheesey, meaty goodness. The pizzas are big, there are a ton of toppings, and the sauce is sweet in a good way. My suggestion is try their white pizza, which I think rivals the ones I've had in New York. I get mine with ricotta cheese, mushrooms, and meatballs- I'm drooling just thinking about it. I also suggest you try their italian hoagie- big, lots of meat, good dressing, and toasted in a crunchy way- my favorite in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing!!  I am from Chicago and very picky about pizza. When my boyfriend brought me here, I was not expecting much but wow was I wrong.  This pizza is so good! The crust is always cooked perfectly and there is tons of cheese.  It's a must have every time we are back in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"The pizza here was great. Very small dining room if your planning on eating in, but man, the pizza was good. I appreciated how the sauce had a much different flavor to it that pretty much anywhere else I've been. The sauce has a sweeter taste to it.   The plates are pretty much small metal pizza tins and I loved it. Just felt like a neighborhood joint that you'd hit once a week if I lived out here."}
{"text":"Friendly and good pizza!  Eat in or take out, great crust!  Growing up always has Mineos pizza !  This is right up there"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place off and on since 2010 (approximately) and i love it! 1 of 3 places that accomodates people with food allergies. Orders are always right and they recently started accepting credit cards too. I like their wings, hoagies and once in a while I'll get their pizza with that delicious oregano based sauce."}
{"text":"Yum, Yum, Yum, this place is quite amazing!!!!  The thin crust and sweet sauce were a perfect combination for this pie.  We ordered cheese slices and they hit the spot for a bit of a hang over from the Steeler game the night before.  I will come back to this spot every time I am in town.  Very good customer service, hot fresh pizza slices, and extremely good prices."}
{"text":"Fiori's is always at, or near the top of the \"best pizza in Pittsburgh\" argument, and rightly so.   Simply put, the pizza is great. An overdose of cheese, sweet sauce, and a seemingly-sweet crust make's Fiori's pizza crave-worthy. How's the rest of the menu, you might wonder? I've always been a big fan of their chicken parm hoagie. The bread they use just softens up perfectly for take out orders. I've tried the meatballs and pasta, as well, and  while both are good, I have to stick with the real gems: the hoagies and pizza.  The only drawbacks are that Fiori's is cash only (but cheap!), they don't have delivery, and parking can be rough. Plus, it gets packed in the evening and late at night, so expect about a 40-minute wait to pick your pizza up. Regardless, if someone asks if it's worth it? The answer is always a resounding \"YES!\""}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!  The service was also fantastic. Extremely friendly. Can't wait to come back the next time in  Pittsburgh. A must try."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the burgh! Are favorites are plain, plain with cold cheese, pepperoni, steak meatballs and italian hoagies."}
{"text":"Parking is a nightmare. Lines to order and/or pickup may be long. Tables may all be full. It is cash only. And, it's all absolutely worth it. The sturdy crust and gooey cheese help put this place in my top 3 pizza places. The pepperoni sends the pizza into another dimension, and their hoagies are pretty fantastic too (I ask for extra Italian dressing). If you want gourmet and a chic, modern appeal, this isn't for you. It's for those who want their tastebuds blown and to be left intoxicated by this pizza."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this is my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh. I'm so sick of pizza chains and pizza made on conveyer belts. Luckily, Fiori's still makes old school pizza that tastes great.  As others have said, the sauce is a little sweet. I personally think the sauce is what makes this pizza so good. The crust is thin and always baked to perfection and is never soggy.   On top of great pizza, Fiori's hoagies are some of the best around. My favorite is the Italian with banana peppers.   The only downside to Fiori's is the parking. It can be frustrating at busy times. Although parking can be tricky, don't let this stop you from eating an excellent pizza."}
{"text":"On vacation from Michigan , my dad who lives in south pointe suggested fioris and let me tell you ..... by far the best pizza I have ever had ! Out of this world can't wait till I come back again to have it again !!!"}
{"text":"Just the facts:  1) Realize there is a difference between authentic Italian pizza which varies from region to region and American/Italian Pizza.  2) Fiori's falls under the latter category.  This is not authnetic Italian pizza.  In my opinion, is the best American/ Italian pizza in the Burgh (because of its sweet sauce).  There Italian Hoagie is great as well.   Most people havent tried their pasta  which is remarkable good for a pizza joint.  3) Have been eating here since I was 5 years old.  I craved this pizza when I was living in Ital  4) Parking sucks.  5) ATM inside cash only"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city, hands down. You might have to stand and eat it, but it is definitely worth it. The staff is always so nice and inviting, service is always fast. perfect crust, sauce is a little sweet, but I'm not complaining, and there is enough cheese on these pies to clog your arteries for the next 50 years. The best, the best, the best."}
{"text":"I grew up eating from this shop. The quality of food is consistent, and it's always delicious. Workers are nice. Mr. Fiori is the best! My only \"complaint\" (which is not really one at all) is that the pizza can be a bit greasy. It tastes so good, though, that I hardly care."}
{"text":"this place is the best.  i have had pizza in new york city and chicago and everywhere in between and this place is the best damn pizza i have ever had."}
{"text":"I've lived in Pittsburgh for 11 years and have been continually disappointed by the pizza scene, but no more! Fiori's is without a doubt the best pizza in the city. I ordered a small (8 cut) pepperoni pizza, which was enough to feed 2 people. The pepperoni was under the cheese and every bite was delicious! I ate 4 pieces in one sitting    Parking was tough for pick-up, but the food was well worth it. I'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Standing ovation. I can't believe I forgot to review this place. Though I haven't been back in years, my boo brought home a slice the other day and it smelled like heaven. Iced tea in a carton? You cannot beat that."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in the city. Hoagies are also pretty good but the pizza takes the spotlight. One of the best places to shoot pool in the south hills next door, what more do you need?"}
{"text":"Hands down the best calzone I've ever had.  The pizza is good, but the calzone is what I make the drive for."}
{"text":"There are 2 Fiori's in town. One is on West Liberty Avenue and then this place which opened about a year ago on  Washington  Road. It is near our church so sometimes after church we go there for lunch.  This location is a much nicer and brighter location.  Their cheese pizza is very good. Occasionally we order toppings but I believe a good pizza doesn't NEED toppings. They also have hoagies which are very good. You order at the counter and they bring your food to you when it's ready. It's a great place to go as a family or group."}
{"text":"We're relocating to Pittsburgh and turned to Yelp to find a great pizza joint after a long day of house hunting. Thank you Yelp for yet another wonderful recommendation. Service is great, restaurant is constantly full of happy, friendly customers...and the food is spectacular. Great prices, too. We can't wait to make this one of our regular spots once we finally move to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh for a long time running. Slightly sweet sauce and dough are rounded out by piles of cheese and fresh ingredients"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm going to go ahead and declare it: Fiori's is the best pizza in Pittsburgh. Now before all of you non-believers begin slinging obscenities at me, just know that I realize that pizza preference is very subjective. But also if you don't have a preference for Fiori's, you're wrong.   What makes Fiori's the best:  1. There's a gallon of grease on each slice 2. There's 52 pounds of cheese on each slice  3. The cheese is dispersed evenly so that every bite is the BEST BITE. 4. The sauce is slightly sweet but not too sweet. 5. The crust is perfectly foldable while being the perfect combination of chewy and crispy.  6. The parking is terrible, so you know it must be good!  I've eaten in a couple of times, but we usually just get take out. Regardless, every pizza has been consistently delicious. Their spaghetti and meatballs are good too if you're into that sort of thing.  A Love Poem for Fiori's: Ooey gooey pizza pie, You're the apple of my eye. I love you more than any guy, Don't tell my husband, kthxbye"}
{"text":"Fiori's has the Best Pizza on Earth, hands down. I have been eating there since we moved to Brookline in the 70's. My god, this pizza is perfect, the sauce sweet, the pepperoni crispy, with a small pool of the, oh, so good grease. I always dip my crust in it , heh. They have some Shakies behind the counter if you ask. Expect to wait if you stop while bar hopping and actually even finding a parking spot, can be a task. Man, I can't wait to get back to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I have tasted the best pizza in the US, Pepe's New Haven, CT and I have tasted a whole bunch of bad pizza and a whole bunch in the middle.  I am coming to the conclusion that pizza is a very personal thing to people who love it like I do.  After years of people telling me to go here, we finally stopped on our way home from my son's hockey game at noon on Saturday.  Service was okay after we asked the people sitting next to us what we needed to do.  No one spoke up to tell us to come to the counter and order.  But after we figured it out everything was good.  We ordered a large pie, 1/2 cheese and 1/2 cheese and sausage.  The crust is very good and some of the best tasting I have had in some time.  It actually had a taste to it not just a bread taste.  After that, everything else is what I consider the personal taste part.  The sauce was to sweet and the cheese was not right to me.  I don't know if they used provolone I should have asked but it gave the pizza a funny taste to me.  I won't be going back, just because my personal taste."}
{"text":"Fiori's lives up to the hype that it has around Pittsburgh! Pizza is classic and delicious and I love that they offer cold cheese on the side which is a personal favorite for me! One negative, don't get extra cheese on your pizza if your getting it to go. By the time you get home it's very messy, but that being said it's still delicious!"}
{"text":"FIrst timers to Fiori's pizza. Parking lot attached, nice newer restaurant, clean, friendly service, order at the front and find a table.  We went with a 6 piece order of garlic parmigiana wings and a large pepperoni and sausage pizza for the two of us. The wings came out and they were deep fried first and then sauced up.  The flavor was good, not too strong not too mild.  The butter sauce all over the plate we dragged our wings through for some extra, not needed!!, flavor.  The pizza came out and was cut into 12 generous sized pieces.  We ate 4 and boxed the rest up to take home.  The pizza here has a sweeter flavored pizza sauce and we also noticed after ordering that the sausage was not a spicy Italian sausage so that was also on the sweeter side.  We enjoyed it though, if you aren't a fan of a sweeter taste of pizza this may not be your place.  There is also a huge amount of cheese on their pizza, yay!!  We love our cheese.  The crust was cooked perfectly with just enough bite to it but still very tender. The service was great, they came by to clean up empty plates, refill drinks and ask how everything was a couple times.  Very clean and we will most likely be back again. No military discount."}
{"text":"Honestly this is the only place we ever get pizza from anymore in this town! I can only vouch for the plain cheese pizza and calzone, they are fantastic though. I would try the mushrooms but judging by reviews I cannot figure out if they're fresh or canned so I'm satisfied with the plain cheese.   It's a small place so we always just bring it home, but it's so good straight out the oven that we usually inhale a slice right away in the car haha before driving home.  I've tried a lot of pizza places in town, like most of them, and fioris just is consistently the best compared to everywhere else (maybe except for benny fiero's in the south side but uh at more than double the price that's just unreasonable ya know?). And I wanted to add, I noticed that a lot of the reviews take points off for the parking situation. I mean this is pittsburgh, finding good parking is like unicorn-level rare around here. My lil secret tip  if there's absolutely no parking anywhere nearby, um just pull into the BP gas station parking lot right across the street :)  Anyway it's the best pizza around (yes as long as you like the type of sauce they use, that is just personal preference though, I never even ate sauce on pizza until Fiori's..) and price-wise yeah it's a little more expensive than like Dominos but the quality is soo much better, it's worth the cost. I crave this pizza all the time, ahh. Oh and personal preference but for some reason it's not the best cold-the-next-day pizza I've had, but it reheats real well and is still amazing reheated the next day.   The only way it could be better is if they offered delivery (or coupons hint hint) but man it's still worth the drive. Thanks for existing, Fiori's ^_^"}
{"text":"Since moving to Pittsburgh in November, I have made it my mission to find the best pizza joint.  It hasn't even been close.  Fiori's is the best.  I love the pepperoni pizza. It's perfect. Just delicious."}
{"text":"I agree with many of the reviewers: the pizza here is good, not great.  It is priced comparably to other restaurants.  I was under the impression that this was a sit-down restaurant with table service, and that is not quite correct.  The diner is not instructed as to whether he or she is to be seated or wait for someone to escort the guest to a table.  It turns out that the customer orders at the counter and the food is brought to the table. The counter staff members were pleasant and upbeat. We asked for water and were brought one glass. We waited a long thirty minutes for our pizza to be brought to the table. Not until we were ready to leave did anyone come over to check on us, at which point a waitress asked if there was anything we needed.  The menu is small and there are but four appetizers, no fried zucchini, a Pittsburgh area favorite.  One of the four appetizers is french fries, something which I consider to be a side dish, not an appetizer. There is only one type of salad: Italian, and it looked great, but it is pricey, a large bowl is $8.95.  The atmosphere is extremely casual and frenetic, not a place for a quiet meal, given that customers are ever-present waiting for take-out orders, looking over the shoulders of the diners, and that the tables are rather close to each other.  This is a place that I might use for take-out orders in the future.  I do not plan to dine in again."}
{"text":"************ALERT:  THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY!!!*************  We just moved to Pittsburgh last winter and have been trying to locate an excellent Pizza place.  Most places we have tried seriously missed the mark-- often tasting like pizza you could get at a bowling alley.  We live in Brookline so we passed Fiori's a number of times, but finaly decided to go in.  Its been our go -to Pizza place ever since.  THIS PIZZA IS FANTASTIC------- IF YOU ORDER EXTRA SAUCE ON THE PIZZA!!!!  Thats why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.   It REALLY needs extra sauce.  I also agree with a previous reviewer that the Pizza is better,  as just plain cheese.   Skip the pepperoni and other toppings.  They just distract and cover up the amazing taste of the sauce cheese and crust. Plain cheese with extra sauce at Fiori's  is where its at!  We usually get a Large 16\" cheese Pizza with extra tomato sauce which costs $14.95.....  I'm telling you, you HAVE to order extra tomato sauce.  Forget extra cheese---- its already loaded with Cheese.    Their crust is fantastic , but it soaks up A LOT of the sauce, so you don't end up tasting the sauce much---- (unless you order extra)  wich is sad because their sauce is AMAZING!!!!! Sweet and tangy. ...  When you can taste it..... SO  JUST ORDER EXTRA SAUCE. Okay??? :) Trust me.  They do not deliver and have very little parking available, and they are STILL always packed.    Just extra confirmation that its GOOD PIZZA!    If you MUST take out, fine.   However,  I recomend Din-In whenever possible. Eating their pizza 3 minutes out of the oven, is quite a different experience than eating it after its sat in a box for 15-20 minutes.   Not that it sucks by the time you get it home....Its just waaayyy better right out of the oven.  Its a signifigant difference in flavor and texture. ORDER EXTRA SAUCE, too!!!"}
{"text":"This place has been hyped up to me for a while, and I have to admit it definitaley lived up to the hype.  The pizza is cooked hot and fresh.  It is cheesy, delicious, and savoyery.  It is easy to make a mediocre pizza, but to take it to that next step of memorable, it takes some special deliciousness, and this place took it to that next step.  I could easily see myself going out of my way to eat this pizza again.  Also, the staff was very friendly, and the atmosphere of this place is the perfect setting of a local, classic pizza joint.    Go here, enjoy the pizza, come back for more."}
{"text":"These guys are AMAZING!  The food is great and everyone there is so welcoming and hospitable.  Went twice on my last trip in and each time the staff looked as though they really enjoyed themselves."}
{"text":"Fiori's is always great pizza - especially when you're on the way home from town and hungry.  It's open late, and usually packed on the weekends.  My recommendation, however, is to go to Campitis (a few blocks away, on Potomac Ave in Dormont) if it's not too late, as they have the best pizza in Dormont.  But you'll never go wrong here, either. Quick, good pizza, and always a pleaser."}
{"text":"Anyone who says this is not the best pizza in Pittsburgh is just full of shit.  It's that simple.   I grew up in Mt. Lebanon (the South Hills) and I used to eat Mineo's Pizza (at it's original location in Dormont) as a kid.   I moved to NYC after high school and have lived there for many years now.  I have also spent a lot of time all over Italy.  So I know good pizza.   FIORE'S is as good as it gets.  The cheese is buttery, creamy, plentiful.  The sauce is perfectly seasoned and generous.  The crust is the very rare combination of crunchy and chewy.  Spectacular!  I am in Pittsburgh for a family wedding this week...so tonight I swung by FIORE'S to grab a whole pizza for my Italian sisters and I.  I got the plain...sometimes I like toppings, yet tonight I felt like the pure original.  It didn't disappoint!  All the elements work together to create a perfect symphony of flavors and textures.    This place has been here for many, many years.  It is located on a very steep and bumpy cobblestone road...totally off the main drag.  There is NO WAY that this place could have survived for so long if it was anything less than the best pizza you've ever tasted.  I actually get cravings for FIORE'S while living in NYC.  It just doesn't get any better.  So don't be a jagoff...be grateful you live in the Burgh, and go get yourself some FIORE'S pizza an'at!"}
{"text":"This place was my spot back in the day  FLAVOR has changed  Customer service isn't always the best"}
{"text":"Always great. White Pizza is awesome. Pasta and meatballs are delicious. Great atmosphere and employees.  I fix u up."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best pizza spots in all of Pizzaburgh.  They have a sugary sauce that goes well with their cheese.  I have eaten here several times."}
{"text":"This pizza is freaking awesome! My son and I go once a week for lunch! Service friendly, place is clean and nicely decorated, staff is accommodating. Love it! Even the salads are wonderful and fresh!"}
{"text":"Being a Pittsburgh area native this is by far the best in the region! We make special trips to the city just so that we can get the large pizza to share.   The thin crust and slightly sweet sauce is rather addicting.   We have a game we play when it's served HOT that we must separate the slices and wait five minutes before eating. It's super tempting to bite in as soon as you get it but you're gonna burn your mouth and ruin the experience. TRUST ME. WORTH THE WAIT.   Been coming here faithfully now for two years since it was introduced to me by someone who had been coming for 20 years prior.    Family owned and you also are able to meeting and see the original Mr. Fiori making pizzas in the front window. Staff is awesome and super friendly. Have built good friendships because there is a minimal turn over in staff. Some of the guys are ALWAYS there.   Seating can be tight if you don't time it right but that's because it's the best. The turn over of tables is quick. Usually someone walks in and then someone else shortly walks out.   Only about a 20 minute wait for the pizza to be cooked(most days).    Love you Fiori's!"}
{"text":"I found this place to be unfortunately average and reputation based. I was quite let down after I finished my two slices. Mostly because of all the hype that surrounds this place. From a non-bias opinion, the pizza here is nothing special. Not to say it never was but currently I believe this place does most it businesses on what people remember it to be not what it now is."}
{"text":"Best pizza. Sometimes you go literally outside the box and try another place and come back to the ones that make a business out of pleasing customers either through their food or through customer service."}
{"text":"LOVE this pizza! It is a little out of the way but completely worth the drive and strife of parking on that hill. The crust is the perfect thinness, the sauce has a slightly sweet tang and the cheese is delicious! I live in Oakland and make excuses to go to the south hills just so I can have Fiori's pizza."}
{"text":"Fiori's...simply the best pizza in Pittsburg!  We were heading home to St. Paris, Ohio from Niagra Falls and had to swing by Pittsburg just for pizza.  May fav is shrimp and mushroom, just amazing.  The crust is great and the sauce is just sweet enough to make...simply the best pizza in Pittsburg."}
{"text":"I LOVE Fiori's. The thought of their slices makes me drool. I can't think of a more perfect pizza anywhere. The pizza sauce is so deliciously sweet, and the crust is the perfect ratio of crunchy to chewy."}
{"text":"Its not pizza, its fiores. Used to work for fiore, nothing but the finest ingredients and 100% consistent!"}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza. We got the large with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. It was VERY busy on a Saturday night but we got our food in a reasonable time. I suggest ordering to go, seating can be limited. Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"A city classic. Always consistent. Order cold mozz for a real experience. Great group of guys working behind the counter."}
{"text":"True pizza afficionados  will tell you that you have to actually eat a pizza in the restaurant to really know how good it is.   Since DeMino's in Brookline is strictly take-out only (I guess I'll have to yelp them another time), I told my friend to take me to Fiori's this evening. I'm all about second chances after all.  Well we actually had the pizza there, and I am not kidding you, IT WAS  WORSE THAN I REMEMBERED IT!  This cheese could be used to stop up a leaky pipe. I still think they put Swiss cheese in with the mozzarella. The more I chewed it, the tougher it got! It didn't even stay on the pizza. In fact, it came off in sheets!  The only topping I got on the small pizza were meatballs, and Fiori's is not only tightfisted with them. They also had no flavor.  Actually, I take that back. They tasted like catfood.  Sweet catfood that is.  The whole pizza was sweet and not in a good way. It was as if someone grabbed the sugar instead of the salt by mistake.   And somebody's doctorin' the sauce or stretchin' it with some good old Heinz 57.   We also split an italian hoagie. That bread was seriously overbaked and therefore too crunchy.   Fiori's also attracted a rather, uh...douchey clientele this particular evening?   Seriously, I loved the three frat boy morons (are they a 'protected class'?) in the booth behind us, especially the one who thought he was Brad Pitt ('I'm so kewl I eat with shades on').   And his buddy Potsy (the token lame-o in the pecking order that just HAS to belong).  And the \"jock\" with the wee-little ponytail from 1993. This trio could have come straight out of any high school movie.   I mean, I loved them so much, I wished they were transported back in time to a South Side bar circa 1974 so they could get their little white boy behinds handed to them by some steelworkers. Y'know? People that actually make the world function?   The laws shield those who goof on everyone they see. I mean, they were actually turning their heads, sneering, looking for people to make fun of, even openly leering and commenting on guy's wives. Thank God they didn't notice my friend and I. Bad pizza makes me...surly.   And what was up with having MSNBC's \"Lockup\" on TV while everyone was eating? Yeah, I really wanna eat dinner while I watch guys gush blood after having been shanked.  Anyway, there are better pizza parlors in Brookline. Fiori's is but fodder for the Brookline Pizza Wars and didn't even survive the first salvo. Why this place has such a cult surrounding it I'll never know. No wonder they're open until 3AM on a Saturday night. You'd have to be blotto as well as famished to enjoy their food.   Come 'n' get me. *snikt*  Bub."}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza I have ever had in my life. I've eaten plenty of pizza. Nothing compares to fioris. I would absolutely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed their pizza, but most recently I tried their hoagies and it was absolutely delicious! The entire staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean which is always good to see."}
{"text":"Fioris pizza is a staple to the South Hills. The sauce is mild and would appeal to most people. It is soo greasy though, like more greasy than any other pizza I've ever eaten and more greasy than I knew was even possible. Even after dozens of paper towels, I can still blot up more.   The employees are friendly and service is always good. We like supporting a small, locally owned business.   Parking is always high in demand so be prepared to walk."}
{"text":"When hunger strikes, Fiori's is a great option.  At a party with friends just up the teeth rattling hill from Fiori's.  Called and ordered 10 pizzas in many styles.   They gave us a time and sure enough they were ready on time.  The pizza was a hit and all but a few slices were finished.  The sauce is a little sweet but it was good and the crust was cooked just right."}
{"text":"I grew up eating this pizza 5 days a week.  Words cannot begin to describe how perfect this pizza is.  I've ate every other pizza in town, claiming to be better than Fiori's, but nothing can dethrone the undisputed champion that they have been for decades. The only pizza that comes close is Franco's pizzeria with my man Danny S"}
{"text":"Fiori's. My all time favorite pizza place. Oh, you have stolen my heart, since I was a child.   I recall memories with my family at my nana's house in Brookline, collecting pizza orders for dinner from my aunts, uncles, and cousins.  I always got to go pick it up with my aunt or my dad, sitting shotgun with the hot pizza on my lap. I remember, vividly, hearing \"Don't tilt it! Keep it flat!\" so the mounds of cheese wouldn't slide to one end.   This is my favorite pizza for several reasons: 1. The sauce is sweet and there's a LOT of it. 2. The sausage is meaty, fatty and has the perfect amount of fennel seed. 3. The crust is crunchy, and chewy, and the rest of the pizza is just flexible enough that you handle it (long enough for it to make it to your mouth without all the cheese sliding off!)   Though a little pricey for a whole pie, Fiori's is always worth it. I'm lucky enough that when I come home to visit there's usually always a Fiori's pizza on the stove.   Now the new trend (new for me) is to get a cup of cold cheese on the side, and top your slice with it while it's steaming hot. I think there's plenty of cheese on it already, so I usually don't get the cold cheese.  Hands down, this is the best pizza that I've ever had, and the best pizza in Pittsburgh by far."}
{"text":"Are you kidding? Best damn pizza in the city! Their hoagies aren't anything to scoff at either. Parking sucks but well worth it, don't let that deter you."}
{"text":"Well wanted some chow after work so I thought I'd try a local place. I ordered a half Italian an sub and slice of pizza. The staff was very friendly and willing to hide me through the ordering process.  Here you order, pay, take a number and head for a table.  The best I can say is \"yawn\". The Italian is ok, I like a vinegar and oil based dressing and this hoagie was very lightly dressed. It contained typical deli meats, light on the lettuce, onion and tomato.  The pizza crust was a bit soggy and as others have remarked, I found the sauce to be too sweet for my palate. In short...I may not come back. The food just isn't good enough to warrant a return trip."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. I probably eat Fiori's pizza at least once a week. I'll be surprised if I live past the age of 30.   The workers are very friendly. Often times my friends and I eat in the dining room rather than ordering takeout. All the workers recognize is because we're in constantly. We have an addiction.   The place is very genuine all the way around. If you like cheesy pizza with a sweet sauce, eat Fiori's pizza.   They also have very good hoagies. I get the Italian hoagie sometimes and it comes nice and crispy. Nothing worse than a soggy sandwich. They also have rigatoni and pasta sauce. Many toppings for the pizzas too. Sausage and onion pizza is out of this world. Now I'm making myself hungry."}
{"text":"If they would deliver they would put all other pizza joints out off business in the south hills...it is that good. We are regulars :)"}
{"text":"I appreciated the quality of the ingredients and the atmosphere very much, but this style of pizza is not really my thing. It's the very thin NY style, greasy, the cheese and toppings wanna slide right off. And though tasty, we got double pepperoni, which in my mind means the pepperonis should be pretty much covering the pizza and YES I realize that they were under the cheese but just not enough. Waiting for the pizza to cool down helped the topping slide problem a bit, but yeah not a big fan of crust this thin. For NY style though, they got it down pat, so that's why the 3 stars. Plus I respect this joint a lot. :)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am a self proclaimed pizza snob. I grew up in Central New York and have spent a considerable amount of time in New York City where it's difficult to find bad pizza. That being said, I was delighted to find Fiori's. The staff was friendly upon arrival and patient as we looked at the menu. The menus pizza section says \"thick crust\" which made me nervous as I was hoping for a thin crust NY style. I asked if they do a thin crust and also how thick their normal crust is. The pizza maker showed me what the standard crust looks like and it was exactly what I was hoping for. So we ordered a large pie, half meatball and half Italian sausage and it was delicious. Fresh and plentiful cheese with a nice sauce. Sauce had a very subtle sweetness to it. The gentleman who made our pizza brought it to our table and offered grated cheese and red pepper flakes. Very friendly atmosphere with a big screen tv which was showing a soccer game at the time. It's worth the trip into the south hills for this pizza as many locals had told me. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Ok pizza.  We went on a Saturday afternoon and the place was packed.  The food came pretty quickly.  The staff is friendly and the place is clean.  The two stars are from the very, very greasy pizza.  We got a cheese pie and it was covered in oil.  We tried our best to sop up the top with paper napkins but there was just too much.  The taste was ok but not great.  The crust was also a little thick for my taste."}
{"text":"Gotta say I'm a big fan, grew up with it and still miss it to this day. If you don't like grease...don't come in the door. This is for pizza people."}
{"text":"This is some good pizza. I got a large pepperoni. The crust was crispy as were the edge on the slices of pepperoni, which I love. The Italian salad was surprisingly delicious. Recommended."}
{"text":"Fiori's pizza is proprietorial, for sure. Most people adore it, some not. I adore it.  It's 'NewYorkStyle' with a distinct flavour, ever-so-slightly on the sweet side, moderately heavy on the cheese, well done bottom - fold it in half and have at it. I make my own amazing pizza at home these days, but, if I want to splurge, I place a big take-out order at Fiori's, like I did for my birthday party last week. Pies, wings, hoagies, and salads - I called in a big order that night and they cranked it out, perfectly, without skipping a beat. It was sooo good! Reliably delicious, I've been eating Fiori's for 24 years."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places! Pizza, fries and hoagies all good here. Love the buffalo sauce on the side as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their pizza!! Toppings are inside the cheese, and I would definitely recommend the pepperoni. Also try their take home pizza kit, only $10 for cheese, you can ask for toppings, and my son loves to make it with us!! Has the same great taste as in the store!!"}
{"text":"First time trying them out since moving to the area. Ordered some hot wings for pick-up, which were very good! I will go back!"}
{"text":"I'm with Zachary on this one, after years of hearing about this pizza I finally tasted a slice at a steeler party. The sauce was normal, kinda sweet, garlicky, nothing special. Loaded with cheese that had pools of grease swimming on it. Knowing I don't eat meat my friends ordered me a half pizza with peppers and onions. It was still dripping with grease. I removed the cheese and just ate the crust with the vegetables. I was still kind of dumbfounded as to why this place gets raves. The crust was nothing to write home about, it was just kind of yeasty and chewy. I definitely don't see what all the fuss is. When I'm going to have a cheat day with pizza it's Beto's for me."}
{"text":"Pizza here tastes great. I'm leaving the one star because last night I went there and I kid you not- most of the employees were clearly on a substance of some kind- I'd say meth or crack. The person who took our order was shaking and had trouble putting sentences together. Another employee was also shaking and coughed in his hands and proceeded to handle hoagie orders with no gloves. I asked who the manager was, and the one seemed the most cracked out was apparently the one in charge. If you own this business, please immediately handle the substance abuse problem with your employees and sanitary handling of food."}
{"text":"I wish I can leave 20 stars best pizza in Pittsburgh hands down just a bit greasy (note, if you are taking out keep the pizza level or the cheese will shift and get messy)"}
{"text":"Great pizza.   Best in Peters Twp.   I've only ordered takeout.  Happy every time.  Friendly staff.  Fair prices.  Great pizza.  Also have tried the wings and Italian hoagie, they very good as well."}
{"text":"The best pizza ever I have grown up eating this, I do see why people do  not love this place, the wings are amazing, try the pizza with meatballs on top"}
{"text":"Yum. Honestly who can go to this place and not like the food? It's just phenomenal pie! Heck it's damn good. Go grab a pie, you'll thank me."}
{"text":"Another really bad Pittsburgh pizzeria that all on you yinzers can't get enough of.  Everything about this place is inconvenient.  They do not deliver and its pretty hard to find parking on the Aggro Crag-esque hill that the shop sits upon.  The interior is dirty and uninviting...I would even go so far as to call it \"rapey\".  After illegally parking with my 4 ways on and waiting for a few minutes one of the employees gave me my pie and I headed home.   The pie it self was a real mess. It is obvious just by looking at the pie that whoever made it took no pride in making it well, they just threw everything together and plopped it in the oven on a wing and a prayer.    The dough is some of the worst dough I have had yet in Pittsburgh.  They are using regular deck brick ovens and cooking the pies directly on the brick so there is no excuse for not being able to achieve some sort of crunch.  It is very dense and flavorless with no crunch at all.  The taste of salt and sugar come through a little bit in a very generic way, almost like a Papa Johns tasting dough.  The main problem was that  the dough obviously didn't rise at all and was very dense and hard to chew.  Its a dry dough too, very dry.  Plus the pizza was made so poorly that the middle of the pie was paper thin and inedible while the outside of the pie was way too thick and was hard to chew.  Basically what we have here is another bowl-like pizza where all of the ingredients pool into the middle because it was made so poorly.    It is pretty clear who is wearing the pants in this pizza, good old Uncle Cheese....and the pants are soaked.  I watched the kid making one of the pies and he just filled up both of his hands with 2 pounds of cheese and tossed it into the middle of the pizza and just kind of scattered it towards the outside and said \"yeah, that will do\".  They are using a really high quality cheese and it does have a great taste and it has that gummy effect that you would get if you ordered extra-cheese.  Unfortunately there is just way way too much of it for the pizza to even be edible in some spots.  You couldn't even pull a slice off of the pie to put it onto your plate without pulling all of the cheese off into a big pile in the middle.  They are using lots and lots of cheese to compensate for how bad the best of the pie sucks.  The sauce is very forgettable and watery.  They put very little sauce on the pie anyway and its applied with no pride in the traditional lazy bulls-eye pattern where you sauce in some spots and none in others.  The sauce has a bit of a sweet taste, un-offensive and maybe tasty if they were to ever put enough on for anyone to taste it.  In general this is just lazy pizza where they would rather give you 2 pounds of cheese than actually have to take pride in their food.  I feel my butt hole starting to cry as I near the end of this review, save yourselves the T.P. and just leave this one alone.    I am giving it a 4 out of 10."}

{"text":"I travel all around Pittsburgh in look for a pizza place that I can call my own. Yesterday my fiancé and I decided to travel 30min to try Fiori's. It was a little out of the way but heard great praise by her family. After the first bite I was taken back to my childhood in Ohio, there was a pizza shop \"42nd street \"that was my favorite growing up then closed. My disappointment of never being able to taste that pizza again haunts me to this day. Fiori's is the first pizza that is on par to that pizza after 15 yrs I can say I have found my pizza place finally. Besides that their staff and dine in area was great. Thank you may you not close in my lifetime. Blessings"}
{"text":"I live in california now and NO ONE can make pizza like Fiori!!! mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Okay I'm not from this area and we came from the casino and were looking for a good place to eat and came across fiores so I'm thinking people from Pittsburg have a distinctive taste when it comes to their pizza I wasn't sure how to rate this place... The service was okay... To be honest the workers looked pretty miserable but they weren't rude or anything. We tried the cheese sticks, garlic bread, deep fried ravioles, and had the large pizza with sausage.... Okay the cheese they use in the pizza is really odd tasting to me it's just got this bitter taste maybe Parmesan mixed in? They made mozzarella sticks same way I couldn't finish them.... The ravioles were fine... Garlic bread... Ughm nothing special... Bland bread with butter and cheese.... And for the pizza... The cheese and sauce were just weird the sauce was very sweet almost like what a previous comment stated \"sugary\" and I guess with the bland bread and it all kind of evens out in a way... Haha ...."}

{"text":"Is this the best Pizza in Pittsburgh? Maybe? Does it have some of the longest waits and poor parking. You betcha, but that is usually also a good sign!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Burgh... The cheese and the sweet sauce combo makes this pizza so delish. Don't get it by the slice, though-- they reheat it. It must be enjoyed HOT right out of the oven."}
{"text":"So after having come from basically not being served anything at all at the new Porch location, we went to Fiori's and got the basics.  Half Italian hoagie, Italian salad, 8 cut pepperoni pizza, and I got my glass of Pinot Noir (finally! -- see review of The Porch at Siena.)  Since you order at the counter at Fiori's, there was no wait, and there were a few tables open so we could eat in.  We ordered, paid, sat, and drinks were delivered within seconds, salad was delivered in 5 minutes, then the hoagie and pizza followed.  I was given a HUGE pour on my wine, and was also given the last of the bottle at no extra charge -- basically I got the equivalent of two glasses.  The only reason they're a 4/5 for me is because they're a little bit too cheesy for me on all dishes, and the ravioli I had on a previous occasion was basically swimming in \"marinara.\"   (As an Italian girl, that pasta sauce offended me, but the raviolis themselves were REALLY good.)  The crust of the pizza, though, is almost perfect.  And the salad minus the copious amount of pizza cheese is simple and good.  Hoagie was toasted well, and the bread did not just disintegrate when you bit into it.  Not over-dressed, not over-stuffed.  Nice."}
{"text":"We are from Georgia and are in Pittsburg for a few days - we saw the reviews for Fiori's with several saying \"best pizza in town\" ( there were 2 others making the same claim but since Fiori's was closest we chose it) the pizza was absolutely delicious! I have never put cold cheese on a pizza before but we saw several others do it so we ordered some and tried it - it added to the experience. There was only seating for about 31 and the booths were pretty tight - we were planning to take the pizza back to our hotel but a table opened up. Usually when we are traveling we do not take leftovers back to the hotel but we definitely took the 3 slices left with us. This would be one of our favorite places if we lived anywhere near here."}
{"text":"Excellent food with large portions.  Service and staff deserve an A+!  Only complaint about this place is that it is freezing in the dining area! I was shivering the entire time."}
{"text":"We Love the Pie and the hoagies aren't  bad either!!!  Since we were kids walking here, Now driving cant pass it by when craving Pizza.                                                Not much has changed, maybe the paint color on the walls and a few faces.             Best of all is when Fiori says \"We'll Fix-a you up!\" and he means it!!!!"}
{"text":"What can you say about Fiori's. i'm going to just start throwing out some words and stop me when you get the point.   legendary, awesome, fantastic, sweet, cheese...oh so much cheese...., epic, beautiful, famous, iconic, local, unique, different, quality...... I think you get the point.   Fiori's is all of those things and more. They are, in my mind, the best Pizza place in Pittsburgh. I know that is a highly debatable topic, but when people from the North Shore bother to go to south hills to a little hole in the wall place with no parking and hardly any room to eat inside, you know it's good.   I lived in Brookline for 2 years and would frequent this place. I would say that eating the pizza in the shop is better than taking it out. Even though it's a small place it's worth it to go to that lightly crispy crust something you don't get when it sit's in a box waiting for you to pick it up.   Also the cheese is the cats meow at this place to don't even bother putting toppings on your pizza. The topping is overshadowed by the sweet sause and the mountain of cheese so don't waist your money. It's better that way, trust me!"}
{"text":"I order the double cheese ( provolone ) pizza. It was crunchy at the bottom, perfect melted cheese on top. Great flavor great quality. The tomato sauce was the lowest score that is why get 4 and not 5 stars. Still it's a great pizza. Eat up."}
{"text":"I have been to this place multiple times and I have only one thing to say about it. It is the best pizza place I have been to in Pittsburgh. Prices are reasonable for the quality and taste of the food they offer. I like their garlic bread and onion rings too."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time the other day. Personally, I'd consider it one of the best pizza joints in the city. Extra cheesy! I'll definitely be back again. Parking  on the street is a bit tight, but its definitely worth it."}
