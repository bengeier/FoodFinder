{"text":"Thought i would randomly start trying some of the local businesses I pass everyday and Dales Deli caught my eye with the help of Yelp. Instantly after looking at the menu I fell in the trap of wanting to order a bit of everything. Pictured below are a chicken Philly and chicken dirty fries. Both were more than satisfactory, service was really quick and personal which is always a plus for me. So much that I've been back twice since this post! If you're looking to try out a place with reasonable prices and solid portions, definitely stop by"}
{"text":"Best delivery option near my work!! The BBQ Bacon Burger is more than worth the price. Dale club sandwich is also a goodie. We've made this our usual lunch place at work."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place a million times.   I purchased a gift certificate on Restaurant.com almost a year ago and it was due to expire.   The menu is a combination of sandwiches (philly cheesesteak etc, dinners (wings, seafood, pork chops etc.) and Asian entrees (fried rice, thai soup). Strange mix of a menu, but I ordered the shrimp dinner which came with 8 large fried shrimp, fries and coleslaw.   The dinner was just ok.  The shrimp were fairly large, but fried a little bit too hard for me.  The fries were of the frozen variety and the coleslaw was nothing special.   My husband and daughter had wing dinners and they were of the same opinion.   All-in-all this was just ok and I would return to try some of the restaurants other menu items."}
{"text":"Dale's has offers an array of things on the menu but the salads are what got my business. I love their grilled chicken and steak salads. You can pretty much build your own salad with all the toppings you love. The only issue is ordering.... I suggest going in rather than ordering by phone. Every time I order by phone my order gets screwed up. Slight language barrier but the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"After driving by this place for as long as I can remember, I finally decided to give it a try. Their corned beef is constantly advertised in front of the building, so I thought I'd get the Dale sandwich.   The sandwich was very good. The corned beef was shaved and crumbly, but still had some moisture to it. The mustard and Swiss cheese complimented it well. It came with a pickle and a hefty portion of French fries. The fries had a nice Cajun seasoning on them, but were a bit on the soggy side.  Overall it was a good meal, and I would consider going there again, but I'm not sure when. If you're in the mood for a quick sandwich, I think Papa Joe's is a far better option. If you're in the mood for a good corned beef sandwich, Muldoon's is leaps and bounds better. At $10.25 for the sandwich plus $0.60 for the cheese plus $1.25 for the fries, there are cheaper options out there. But they do deliver, so it's nice to have available if you want delivery and don't want pizza or Chinese."}
{"text":"Have eaten this food over the years since it opened as Dales although not recently. The owners after Dales were from the Otani Restaurant family, hence the Asian influence. Joyce used to deliver some of the tastiest sandwiches and meal around. They really do prepare \"American\" food as well or better than most Americans! Try the \"Daleburger\". Outstanding."}
{"text":"Loveeee hey good order there turkey club w fried fried were so deliscious they come w seasoning on them and the sandwich was stacked w turkey and lettuce tomato and bacon omg so good I had it at work and I work in a hospital they will deliver straight up to your floor I'm in love"}
{"text":"Where can you find a nice and large quantities of corned beef sandwich and homemade burger!? Only in dale's deli! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"So let's start with the 4 inches of meat packed in this sandwich! I've been here twice now and have had the corned beef and the Reuben. I hold every city with good food to Chicago standards but these two versions far exceed anything I've had in Chicago thus far. You can tell this is a city that specializes in these sandwiches. Dales is a hole in the wall that I hear doubles as a \"alleged\" underground gambling op. Not sure about the validity to this claim but even if it was true they seem to give lots of attention to the crafting of the sandwiches. They have tables out front and no room to sit inside. Pick up only. Food is made to order and comes out quick. Staff is nice and the sandwiches....O-M-G! My wife's cousins says there a bigger better corned beef here in town. I guess I'm going to have to see for myself!"}
{"text":"Foods OK ..Service sucked..Don't go on your lunch break ..Order that shit online and was still 30 min wait to the shitty food.topper was I wanted horseradish with my C.B. ..They wanted to charge more money..Haha..Good luck Asian Dale"}
{"text":"The food is good especially the fish dinners and salads. I ordered a Corned beef before which came soggy. If you want your food fresh and not soggy order and pick it up or order there! Other than they they're good."}
{"text":"They suck! Bad business, super late with delivery both times ive tried, delivery driver was very rude, the person answering the phone rushed me off the phone and kept hanging up. The food wasn't that great, ive had better in the area. I only added a star because it made me"}
{"text":"For the price you pay, the quality you get and the speed with which you get it - even on delivery, this place is hands down one of the best deals around.  Quality has not slipped at all and neither have the recipes.  Everything we've ordered has been fresh and delicious.  the cornbeef, whole wings, rice, salads, fish!  Top notch."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches. Good variety. The lady there is awesome too.  Always carry out for lunch from there. Huge salads too."}
