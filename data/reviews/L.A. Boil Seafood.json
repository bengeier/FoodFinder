{"text":"A unique place for a unique experience. Perfect for seafood lovers! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Love the seafood! It's really not for everyone though. Your food comes in a plastic bag and you have a bucket on the table for shells. It's a messy experience but it is worth a shot if you love seafood."}
{"text":"This place is a must! My husband and I went for dinner on a Thursday.The restaurant was still busy but we were able to be seated right away which was lucky as this place can get quite busy that you could be waiting for a table for up to 45 mins (we tried once on the weekend ). 

The atmosphere was relaxed and fun as you get to wear bibs that you can write on.

The food was fantastic. We ordered lobster and snow crab with the LA boil sauce everyone has been raving about (and rightfully so). The sauce was delicious.  I ordered mine medium and my husband mild. I enjoy spicy food. However, by the time I got to the end of the bag, my mouth was heating up pretty well. I think I will try the mild next time. The portions were the perfect size that we didn't have any leftover and didn't feel too stuffed.

The salad bar was small with limited and poor selection. It was not replenished when we got to it. But this was no biggie for us as we were there for the seafood.

The service was exceptional right from when we got there to when we left. We were greeted warmly and shown how to use the iPad to make our order. Our waitress Nicole was attentive and was always smiling which helped make our experience even that much better. The manager was clearly present in the restaurant which was nice to see as it made me feel like he cared to make sure everything was running smoothly that night. The staff seemed happy to be working there. Each staff member we walked by on our way out thanked us for coming and wished us a good night. Definitely makes a customer feel wanted!

The price was reasonable for what they offered.

Overall, our first experience at LA Boil was a great one and we would definitely return and recommend this place to all our friends. Keep up the amazing work and awesome food!"}
{"text":"It was so great taste and wonderful service. I will definitely invite my other friends come to here for party! Good job!"}
{"text":"Too many waiters hovering around doing nothing.  Also raised their prices and no lunch menu on weekends.  Kind of a ripoff from when they first opened.  Oh, amd the best part?  NO CRAYFISH!!!  Signs all over!  So no signature dish? Why open? And if you do, make up for it somehow! Not going back to this one...may try another in USA..oh nevermind not with the Donald...he sucks worse then they do!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the boil, but there were disappointments. We went as a party of two a month ago. It was quiet unlike for other reviewers, with just a couple groups. We ordered the \"L.A. Boil\" (the combo of Cajun, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic Butter flavours), mild (a nice reserved kick), with Dungeness crab and shrimp with zucchini, plus the Cajun seafood rice (fairly tasty). The server was good and explained our options well. I wanted okra but they were out. The cocktail was terribly sweet. Included in our meal was the AYCE salad bar, but it was very minimal, with more plastic flowers than salad options. The only non-dressed veggie item was lettuce, but I'm glad it wasn't dressed. I didn't try potato, surimi, and broccoli salads, plus Caesar dressing, bacon bits, pickles, and croutons. 
I will go back for the boil as the flavour and the seafood was good. The crab and shrimp were tasty, messy, and filling. You get your boil served to you in a heavy plastic bag and eating is a hands-on activity. If you're there for the seafood and expect some splatter (bib, gloves, shell crackers included), you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"interesting concept, cause I LOVE SEAFOOD!
service was great, food fantastic, I like the interactive part of the experience. definitely will come back, and recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst experience. Seafood had no flavour or taste and the oysters were terrible.  They changed the restaurant from the previous Vietnamese to a Seafood concept. Kept the same furniture and changed the food and branding .  Not worth the value."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Had oysters as appetizer, gumbo and soup.
Our soup was served in a plastic pot.
Food was not too bad but there are better places to go for seafood.
Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great seafood with lots of tasty sauce options. Be prepared for a messy meal since seafood is served in bags. The restaurant provides big bibs and gloves to make this easier.

Tried the ship, clams, mussels, and lobster. All were great but mussels and lobster were definitely the highlight. I especially enjoyed the city and garlic butter sauces. Would also recommend the salad bar.

Since the restaurant is new the service was still a bit slow bit not a big inconvenience. Will definitely be back again. Prices are also reasonable for amount that you get."}
{"text":"Good value for the price.  Tasty food.   We each Had the shrimp with different spice combinations.  Will go back to try other types of seafood.  We recently had been to a very popular captains boil in LA and that was extraordinary but pricey.  This may not be as good but the affordability makes up for it.  Like seafood? Give this a try."}
{"text":"We have been looking for other seafood places because really there isn't enough selection so we heard of LA Boil. Like most I was surprised that everything came in plastic bags but that didn't bother me surprising yes but I thought the plastic gloves and bibs wear a little weird especially for the places atmosphere but again whatever not a big deal. I found the food ok nothing special really. You get a lot of food for your money but the calamari was kinda slimy and the shrimp and crab was over killed with garlic almost to the point that it was unediable. I love garlic but the bottom of the bags were literally a pound of melted butter and a whole garlic. Pretty disappointing we won't be visiting again RL is still the better option"}
{"text":"Poor service, extremely slow and disorganized.  The menu had items out of stock and the price was expensive for small quantities.  It was disappointing and left me hungry despite spending a lot of $.  Would not suggest going to this place.   
Edit- had to go here a second time with a group of friends.  It was still not a good place.  Service was still crappy and the food was still of no better quality.  Not impressed"}
{"text":"They have the tablet app to order your food. We got the snow crab legs with the all-in-one sauce and steamed rice. The sauce was delicious. Every bite makes me want to have more of those sauce and legs lol will definitely be back. Our server was too attentive, was continuously asking how we were. But would prefer that over bad service."}
{"text":"Didn't like being served the shrimp in a plastic bag. It was way too oily. Clam chowder soup could not possibly be homemade and was watery. Hated the plastic cutlery and flimsy cups that buckle. It was messy and gross. The paper tablecloth was so dirty and oily from the way they serve. It was disgusting. Smell the oysters before you eat them. The shrimp noodle dish was very good. The best part of the meal was the garlic butter. No debit, only credit or cash from their ATM which charges a $1.75 service fee. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great service! We decided to try out the hype. It was an interesting experience eating with out of plastic bags while wearing plastic gloves. Its an extremely messy process so the gloves were an absolute lifesaver for clean and non greasy hands. Also thank goodness the staff was attendant and would remove tissues and plates quickly... It would just be overwhelming. 

Food was tasty! We ordered garlic butter shrimp, LA boil flavored clams, LA boil flavored mussels and LA boil flavored king crab legs with added veggies. The LA boil medium was delicious and garlicy. Good thing we went out for dinner because everyone probably wanted to stay away from me after that meal. Portions were alright. Salad bar was small classic make your own Ceasar salad plus a few slices of random mangos and pickles on the side. Highly recommend ordering some sort of carb (like the cajun fries or seafood fried rice). The fries were amazing when dipped in the flavorful LA boil sauce/water that the seafood was boiled in. Way better than plain ole ketchup! 

Overall it was a fun experience at a good price for our family. Would recommend trying it at least once! :)"}
{"text":"We went for our family dinner. Soft shell crab is surprisingly good but only when it's hot.  Cajun fries soaked in any of the seafood sauce is superrrrr! Strongly recommended! Vegetable pack is a very good side for the family. Shrimp is good with lemon pepper sauce; but found that the same thing is better at Captains boil in north york. LA Boil sauce is pretty good though with the Dungeness crab. Clams in the garlic sauce are very delicious! Loved the garlic sauce!
Overall it is a good place for family and friends gathering. Will go back."}
{"text":"Went here for an early dinner with my friends. We spent $20 each for 2 lb snow crab legs, 1 lb shrimp, and 1 lb crayfish. That included one serving or rice. I wish there was a deal for big groups - like ordering a certain amount will give you free rice/side. I was satisfied but not full after spending $20.

The seafood was delicious. We ordered mild and medium sauces which weren't too spicy for me (I'm not good with spicy food). I enjoyed it and I would come back for more crab and shrimp.

The place was clean and nicely decorated. Waiter was easy to talk to. The restaurant became busy after we ate (around 7 pm on Sunday). It was a great experience, wish it was a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"Yum yum  great value and staff. It's very casual expect to get dirty - messy but delish ! Served on paper plates ( I didn't care!)"}
{"text":"If you like seafood then you'll love this place! 

I love my seafood and have been to both captain's boil locations in Toronto and boiling crab locations in the states. I have to say that LA boil comes extremely close to the other restaurants! The best part is that it's close to home! So whenever I'm craving it, I can easily get there!

I've been here twice in the last few months and was satisfied both times. The first time I came, it was on a Sunday at 6:30 and we waited about 20 mins to be seated (for 2 people). It was quite busy but once we were seated, service was quick! The second time I came, it was Sunday afternoon around 1pm and we got seated right away (for 5 people). 

The menu is from an iPad. For those of you that have been to 168 sushi on Dundas, it's the same management, which is why they have iPads as their menus. I only know this because I recognized one of the waitresses and the manager so I asked them! It might also explain why they offer items like fried rice (other locations don't have this). Unfortunately they don't have fish and chips (unless it changes)! 

Overall this place is great! Price is reasonable for what you're getting, flavours are really good and service is great! 

Will definitely continue recommending this place to others and will be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Food was okay but service was terrible.  We had reservations for 4 at 7pm.  Felt rushed to eat and give up table.  We will never be back.  Asked for manager but never happened."}
{"text":"Bias alert! I have known the managing partner at this restaurant for about ten years; however he was not there when I had lunch today. When I first met him, He was a part time sushi chef in Brampton.

I really enjoyed my lunch at this L A Seafood Boil. I had nothing fancy. Just their seafood combo of shrimps, mussels, clams and sausage. I had an option of french fries or steamed rice and decided to order the fries. I also opted for mild house sauce.

The sauce was great and the seafood was cooked perfectly. I was surprised at how much I liked the fries. They went well with the boiled seafood. The servers were nice, and the food arrived quickly after I had placed my order.

Lobster and crab meat are available, but you do not have to splurge in order to have a fine meal."}
{"text":"Confused restaurant.. It thought it was a dance club... Nothing like eating lobster while dropping the bass.."}
{"text":"The food was good, fun atmosphere. The menu is quite limited, no dessert options available, but overall good food considering the small selection."}
{"text":"Nothing says appetizing than having your food served in plastic bags while drinking water from a plastic cup. I love seafood but the food served was mediocre to say the least.  We ordered snow crab legs and mixed sea food combo with rice and it was unremarkable. I'm never going back."}
{"text":"Went during the promotional period. Had the veggie combo, lobster, crab leg. The sauce for the naan was REALLY good!!! Overall is good value and drink is priced very reasonable."}
{"text":"this was our first visit to this new restaurant and it was a disaster. there were 2 of us and my meal arived 5-7 minutes before my companion. his meal finally arrived but it took another 5 plus minutes for his french fries to arrive.
i had corn chowder ( watery and tasteless ) and some gumbo which was the least authentic i have ever tasted. this is a louisianna style restauraurant so they should know how to make gumbo. the salad bar included with some meals had six salads and had no eye appeal but the salads tasted ok.
the price for the lunch specials is very reasonable but regardless the meal was so poor, i would never go back.
if you must go, visit soon as i predict they will be out of business in less than 6 months"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic !! Great service same owner as 168 sushi . Easy to order with the use of ipad . If you craving for seafood this is the place . Lots of seating so u wont have a problem bringing in groups ."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner the other night and it was okay.  The food was average and the service was fantastic!  We had an amazing server who was very kind and helpful.  

The menu was kind of small (there were only a few items on it) but you could customize your order.

If you order a seafood dinner, you first choose the seafood you would like (ie: lobster, shrimp, clams, mussels, etc). Next you select the sauce (this is all done on an iPad) and any extra vegetables you may want added to the dish. 

The restaurant has 5 or 6 sauces you can choose from and one can be made gluten and dairy free. I ordered the seafood jambalaya dinner with their dairy free curry sauce. My entree came with shrimp (they had shells and eyes upon arrival), muscles, clams and sausage. It was pretty good and it arrived in a plastic bag like they do at Captain Boil. 

My dad ordered a seafood sandwich and and he said it was okay and really filling.  After you place your order you are told that you can have salad from their salad bar. Their salad bar is really small and it had Caesar salad, seafood salad, potato salad and some other side dishes. The employees told me three of the items at the salad bar were dairy and gluten free but I immediately had stomach issues after eating something from the salad bar so I would avoid it if you have either food sensitivity. 

Allover the restaurant was okay, but the food didn't really impress me. I could potentially see myself going back if someone really wanted to go there but the odds of me visiting this restaurant by my choice is highly unlikely.

It's worth the experience!"}
{"text":"Went here thinking it would be delicious. I think I just ordered the wrong thing.  Got the lunch special with fish and steamed rice. Disgusting. Hot the mussels covered in mayonnaise and cheese. Nasty. Should have known. Peeled off all that fat and ate the mussels. Not bad. Got the shrimps appetizer. Gross. Salad bar. No selections and one creamy dressing all served on paper plates and plastic forks. Service was great and so was the tablet menu. That's the only reason I give 2 stars. Save your money and go get some real food somewhere delicious."}
{"text":"Overcooked shrimp. Informed the server and was told, \"sorry, sometimes we overboil the shrimp.\" Disappointing. Will NOT be coming back."}
{"text":"So had to check out this new spot as I'm obsessed with seafood.

I'm liking this place better than Captain's Boil as its a lot bigger, closer to Brampton and easy free parking...how can you beat that?

The taste and quality of the seafood is probably just as good as the other seafood boils and you definitely get your monies worth.

Staff is friendly and welcoming...it was nice to get 10% off for their opening special...20% would have been better but it's better than nothing.

I enjoyed my dinner today, food came out fast and hot!"}
{"text":"I love it. The food was hot and fast. A ton wailing staff to ask questions. The place so busy.  The food was so good. La sauce has a lot of garlic and so good. I love the idea we get customize the order. 
Great place for seafood."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new restaurants after all the Facebook ads I saw. The restaurants is hip with trendy music blasting and friendly staff. However the experience went downhill fast after placing my order. Kitchen was extremely slow with only two tables to serve. My food looked great but the taste was off and the smell wretched! I ordered the soft shell crab platter and the crab was like jelly and had a high fishy smell unlike any other crab platter I have consumed. It came with no lemon wedges to kill the stench and the waitress watched me eat the sides but never asked me how was it until she came to clear the table and I voiced my disappointment.  I expected to have the manager come out but no such luck, so the waitress presented the bill and said they are New so still working out the kinks.  Not the words I expected given I dropped $22 on a lunch sandwich which was subpar from this place.   If you don't have a strong stomach or patience for mistakes with your meal DONT eat here! Sorry to sound blunt but what a waste of time and money"}
{"text":"We ordered the set for 4 and when our food arrived we had noticed that we never got our 1lb of snow crab legs. After asking for it, the server told us that they ran out of crab legs and gave us and extra 0.5lb of Shrimp and Mussels. We were confused and argued that we at least should have been informed of this matter, instead of just secretly swapping the snow crab legs with the cheapest item on the menu."}
{"text":"First time at a Louisiana boil type place. I decided to try L.A. Boil because it recently opened up in my neighbourhood. Came here on a Wednesday evening and the place was pretty full. We had the seafood combo (shrimp, mussels, clams and sausage) in L.A. Boil sauce, seafood fried rice, fries and the softshell crab sandwich. The boiled seafood was delicious! Great flavour and heat of the sauce however the shrimp could have tasted fresher. The rice was meh and the fries were average, would be nice to have some cajun spice on the fries. Crab sandwich was small and the bun was soggy bc of the tomato and sauce. Crab had a perfect crisp but it lacked seasoning. 

Atmosphere: loud with the music and kids at the table nearby. Fairly small place but I didn't feel crowded.

Service was fast and our server was polite. I never heard anyone say thank you so many times haha. 

Not quite like being in NOLA but worth a try if you like seafood- great tasting sauce!"}
{"text":"What a great time ! Forgetting all about eating etiquette .. roll up your sleeves and dig in. Waiting for that champion who would peel all shrimps. 
Service was very welcome, nice atmosphere. I had fried calamari , grilled squid, broccoli soup, shrimp with their LA Boil sauce had a Mistry taste, I wouldn't recommend it for kids. Sure I would come again."}
{"text":"If you're planning to go here, book a reservation ahead of time or else you're gonna wait for 30mins to an hour specially on saturdays. Otherwise, food is great, they have Combo option where you can try each (shrimp, mussels, clam, sausage) and add sides in it. Sides are better than Captain Boil as well as the sauce. Ordering is quite confusing because it's on an iPad. Once you put ur order, you cant edit it. You have to start all over again"}
{"text":"Awesome!

Best restaurant of its type. Great value. Better sauce selection. Better quality sides than other boil joints. 

The menu is also more interesting. And a far greater value. 

Highly recommended if you are into boil joints"}
{"text":"Went back again last night. I was happy to see for the first time this location seemed to have life! It was packed when we got there and we had a short 10 minute wait. For 3 people with the 10% off my bill gave to $57 with tip. This place is great value!

It helped that I knew how the iPad system worked because it cut down so much of the initial confusion many people were having. We received our food within 5 minutes of ordering so I would think they have the seafood steamed and ready to be tossed in the sauce at a minutes notice. 

Service aside - the food was amazing and delicious. A week later I'm happy to see the portion sizes haven't gone down, the 10% is still on and the sauces just as good. The shrimp were juicy, large and oh so yummy. My sister got the mussels which were so good too! You must get the shrimp when you go there! We added sausage, potatoes, corn and mushrooms selectively to our bags. 

What I didn't care for was the service. While I understand it was busy - there were many times I saw waiters hanging around and chit chatting. You could take that time and walk around to see if anyone needs anything or more water (3 cups of water here!). They also brought out my sister's and my food first and then realized they forgot my moms food. 

We also never saw our server Hilda during most of our meal except at the end for our bill. It is what it is though, they are new and probably just getting the hang of things. 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Dined here on a Saturday afternoon the place was pretty empty so we didn't wait long for our food.  I ordered the snow crab legs with potatoes and corn in LA Boil seasoning.  Portion of crab legs approx 6 was around $30.00 and with sides added up to just over $40.00.  The legs were ok...not very big and not very meaty considering the price.  As other reviewers noted the cracker they give you is pretty useless so I brought food shears from home which I used to cut open the crab legs..it made things much easier and I didn't waste any crab.  Overall flavor of the boil was very good..i ordered mild but found it quite spicy.  I would return but would probably try something other than the snow crab."}
{"text":"I ate here on a Sunday for lunch. We ordered a lb of mussels with mushrooms and okra, and the seafood bag with calamari, fried oyster. First and foremost, the atmosphere is really nice, I like the bibs, the gloves, and the cups you drink in are different than most restaurants. I ordered the mussels with garlic butter sauce, the sauce was too bland in my opinion but still good. My boyfriend ordered the seafood with LA boil sauce and it was so good! Just the perfect amount of spice, I would definitely recommend this sauce for anyone. It has garlic butter, lemon and Cajun sauce mixed together. 
Although the seafood was good, I did not enjoy the appetizers. The fried calamari and fried oysters were extremely mediocre and can tasted if you oven baked it yourself. 
Value is decent, with 10% off our total came to about 35~40 dollars excluding the tip 
Overall I would come back for the seafood."}
{"text":"Visited Sat Oct 29 for dinner
They took reservation by phone only, no problems doing this. My first time going to a boil restaurant so I have no basis for comparison. 

Pros
Plenty of parking in the parking lot. 
The food came fast, within 2 min!
Clams 1 pound were amazing and worth the money.
Shrimp 1 pound was plenty and we had to take some home.
A newer item cajun seafood fried rice noodle - tasted good, portion was huge had to take some home. 
The volume of dining wasn't too loud which is nice.  
The bibs and plastic gloves added an interesting element to the drining. It's easier to just peel shrimp with your bare hands. 
Friendly dining service from David, almost too friendly as he wanted to chat so much. 
AYCE salad a great idea, only saw 1 other person fill up salad while I was there. Remember your mom said to eat your veggies!
i liked that they give you a marker so that you can write a funny message on your bib before you take a selfie. 

Cons
The plastic forks and paper plates looked and felt cheap to me. At home people use proper plats and utensils to eat, would have expected proper utensils. 
The mens and women's washroom doors were left open, no wonder a guy walked into the ladies by accident. I felt like I had no privacy when using the urinal. Suggest they keep both doors closed. 
It's a bit tricky to enter the parking lot as there are medians on the roads of Dundas and Churchill Ave. You may need to do a U-turn to enter. 
One of the staff didn't even know what the LA in the name of the restaurant meant, does it mean Los Angeles? It's supposed to mean Louisiana. 
All the staff are asian, no diversity in employment? Is this an asian franchise?
They provided a lime cut in half to sqeeze, makig it really difficult to squeeze lime juice. Suggest that they cut them into wedges. 

Protip - Order just one AYCE salad and then just re-fill it :)

Damage - $48 pre tip"}
{"text":"I stopped there for lunch but when i look at the menu it is a bit over my price range for a lunch"}
{"text":"Good food but way too messy!  I can deal with the plastic gloves and bibs, but disposable cutlery?  Even the smoked salmon soup (which was flavourful but looked nothing like the menu picture) was served in a clear plastic cup. I felt like it was paying a premium to eat out of plastic takeout containers. I tried the shrimp with sausage and clams with okra. The medium spicy LA Boil sauce was good but everything came in bags so I was scooping sauce out of a plastic bag with a little plastic spoon.  The shrimp was very good but not good enough to bring me back. What can I say, I prefer to eat in a bit more dignified manner."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan. The meals are served in plastic bags the the food was presumably boiled in. You are given cheap plastic gloves and expected to eat with your hands. The crackers provided for breaking the shells are pretty useless. Zipper utensils would have made it easier. The food was good quality and the staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is spacious and well ventilated. Which is good for groups! 

I came for sunday lunch and the ipad (yes their menu is on an iPad and the host gives you a nice short tutorial on how to order with it) said that the clams and crawfish were sold out, i was ready to grab my bag and leave but luckily my server came through and managed to snag some for us. 

The naan bread with curry sauce was delish! but they only served one sauce even tho the photo showed two but the curry one was really good. 

sauce: my mom doesn't eat butter so we were kind of limited to 3 sauces: lemon pepper, cajun, curry. I felt the sauces were strong that i didn't really taste the seafood taste. But we did order the clams with garlic butter on the side and man oh man the clams were delish by itself (my sis did say that the garlic butter was amazing as well) 

Suggestion: get the sauce on the side and dip as you please :)

naan bread, 1lb shimp, 1lb clams, 2 lbs crawfish= $63

I would say pretty reasonable for seafood lunch"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to come here because I've never been to a boil bar and I wanted to try it out. This is also Mississauga's only boil bar, and it was the only place we could go to unless we wanted to commute downtown to go to Captain's Boil. We ordered the lunch special for two and a pound of the snow crab. The sides - seafood fried rice and Cajun fries were also better than I had expected. The taste of the seafood fried rice was typical, and fries were crispy. The LA Boil sauce was definitely the best, and I recommend adding on items such as corn or sausage. We were incredibly stuffed and had to take a lot of the leftovers home. 

The experience was fun but it was messy to eat, especially the snow crab. We got it because I was craving crab, but in retrospect, we shouldn't have gotten it. We spent more time trying to crack it open instead of eating it. It became such a nuisance, and because of its price point, it just wasn't worth it. 

When we asked for water, plates, and utensils, everything was plastic. I was surprised because it didn't really match the restaurant's atmosphere. It made me feel like I was at a take-out joint instead of a chic restaurant. As a result, I was surprised when our sides came on actual plates.  

The service here was pretty good. We got our food really quickly, and our server packed up our leftovers very carefully as all the seafood were double bagged, and we got a big paper bag to carry everything. 

I'd recommend coming here for a fun experience, and specifically for lunch because it's the best value for the price point."}
{"text":"Came here the first day of opening.  Tried three sauces: curry, butter & garlic and their signature LA boil sauce, all taste excellent (much better than Captain boils).  Definitely would come back here again."}
{"text":"LA BOIL!                  *****5 STARS*****
I had been wanted to come here since this place had opened up as I'm a big fan of piping hot bagged seafood style restaurants. Well I was absolutely blown away with the service, food and the ambiance was not bad either.

So me along with 5 others had a reservation for 6pm and guess what we got there at 5:55 and the table was all ready for us. Our bill was to be split up in three so we got three  i Pads to order on. You order on iPads, pick what you want and can also pick the sauce and level of spice you might like. 

Coming back to the service, so after we ordered the food it came in less than 15 mins. The quality and taste were both outstanding. The service was quick and friendly I had absolutely no complaints. 

So for food I had bag of shrimp with corn on the side, snow crab legs and seafood fried rice which were to die for.I picked my shrimps in Cajun sauce/mild spice and snow crab legs in LA BOIL sauce in mild spice.LA boil sauce was definitely the winner for me.

The ambiance is pretty basic nothing really worth the mention though I wish the place was a bit more open.I really didn't get the chance to use the bathroom so can't comment on the cleanliness. They do hand you bibs and gloves to start off with and hand wipes in the end.

This place is pretty centrally located with tons of parking at the rear end of the restaurant.Its great for the buck too, at least i though so.Toronto/GTA needs more places like this and looking as how it busy it was i feel the demand is pretty strong.

Overall the food was amazing honestly I do look forward to going there again and again and I hope they open up more locations. Service was absolutely fabulous and therefore I will give this place a 5 star.

 FYI THEY DON'T TAKE DEBIT!"}
{"text":"Service: amazing! The server was very friendly and accommodating. 

Food: my family and I ordered the baked mussels, naan, seafood & sausage combo (with a side of fries), mussels (with potato) and shrimp (with sausage and corn), all with the la boil sauce. In my opinion, the sauce was pretty good. I felt that the amount of mussels that was served was underwhelming, I wouldn't say it was worth it for the price point. 
The potatoes were hard. The fries were pretty good, they were kind of like costco fries but less crispy. The baked mussels seemed like there was a lot of mayo/sauce on it, so it felt very fattening and greasy. Other than that, the rest of the food was great! The salad bar is kind of pitiful, but it was free so it's understandable."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, because of the friendly service, the tablet based ordering system and all the accoutrements to keep someone clean while eating messy food (gloves and a bib). 

Unfortunately my Cajun chicken and shrimp sandwich was rather mediocre and overly spiced, and my fries were just terrible. 

Serving soup in a takeout container with plastic cutlery doesn't really make you feel special, and I cut my mouth on the spoon. 

I will give this place one more chance, to have their shrimp with corn on the cob, which comes in a plastic bag (?)."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of seafood, messy eating and spicy sauces!!! Bang, Bang, and BANG!

Having tried New Orleans style crayfish, I definitely did not order it here. But we went for 2 lbs of shrimp, 3 lbs mussels, 2 lb dungeness crab, 2 lb lobster and 1 lb clams with sweet potato fries, fried oysters, fried soft shell crab, and their cajun friend rice. 

Everything was spicy as a sauce for my sister in law who can't do spice at all, even the lemon pepper was red. The only sauce was garlic butter that had no spice. 

Now the LA boil sauce which was a mix of garlic butter, cajun and lemon pepper was delicious. My brother who was the birthday boy wanted it on everything! I got a side of crazy fire hot on the side and it wasn't crazy but definitely had a nice build up kick. 

The service was great until we finished our food and then everyone disappeared, took us awhile to get takeaway boxes, bill and more water. 

Bill for 5 of us (who really over indulged) was over $200

My sister in law wasn't a fan of the plastic cup, bowls, cutlery and bags, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Brings out the natural side of us all. 

Would go back for a special occassion but not anytime soon. Wish their salad bar was amped up a bit more for the $3.95 price tag, some fruit would be nice!"}
{"text":"There is a multitude of fresh seafood to choose from here and they have interesting choices of sauces you can choose from. I was pleasantly surprized by the tasty large oysters. This place is more of a hearty food place that is a fun experience. It is not cheap though obviously because it is seafood. The crawfish is the only item that is frozen I believe. Service and ambiance is pleasant. Salad bar did not look inviting."}
{"text":"Went as a group of six on a Friday night. The first person from our party arrived at the restaurant around 6:50pm and was told there would be a 25 minute wait... but ended up being seated in 5 mins! 

Ordering is done via an iPad and is a simple process.  

Among 3 people, we shared a bag each of shrimp, lobster, and king grab in LA boil sauce and medium heat, along with one serving of fries. I've been to a seafood boil restaurant once before, in California. Comparatively, I feel the sauce there was better and of course the seafood was more fresh there, but we all still really enjoyed the experience here. I enjoyed the lobster the most; the two people I shared with preferred the crab. As someone who enjoys spicy food, the medium heat was appropriate for me. 

The experience is definitely novelty (wearing a bib and plastic gloves to eat seafood from bags directly on your table, cracking lobster/crab shells and peeling shrimps) so worth a visit. Order rice though! We forgot and everyone agreed the meal would be better with it.

Service was good as well - our waitress was friendly and checked in on us a couple times. 

Cost: $35-40/person including tip"}
{"text":"You have heard of Faux news, try Faux menu.  
I will get to the food in a minute, but nothing is-worse than falsehoods. 

Ordered several items one of which was the lobster. The menu says \"about 2 pounds\"  this baby was probably closer to less than one pound, very very small.  So I called the waiter and showed him his genius answer was to tell me they shrink.  The next staff member said sorry, smiled and walked away. 

If you want to serve 1 pound lobsters, then fine, put one pound in the menu and don't make light of deceptive practices when asked. The owner is the same as shushi186  all you can eat next door and guess is not used to having to be clear on portion size   

The LA boil spice was good, the lobster just slightly over cooked.  The lemon pepper spice on the mussels was also good, but the used large mussels vs the med size ones, so a little chewier than should be, but flavour ok. 

The Cajun seafood rice was good. But really not sure about eating out of the plastic bag.  Would have preferred a bowl, but made due. 

Would not go back simply because they refused to acknowledge or deal with the mini lobster."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. We ordered the shrimp, crawfish, crab and lobster. The food was AMAZING. The LA boil sauce on the shrimp was so yummy along with the garlic butter on the lobster. I love the iPads for ordering. The staff was INCREDIBLE!! I was having a hard time getting the Cajun crab out so right away my waitress brought me a crab fork. When I was still having trouble she brought the scissors. I've never had that other places. She brought extra gloves so we could drink our drinks. All around amazing experience"}
{"text":"The food was bland, the atmosphere made no sense, the service was terrible and it seemed like one big gimmick. Lastly have you ever tried to hold a boiling hot lobster with plastic gloves? Spoiler alert, IT FUCKING BURNS!"}
{"text":"Spacious and cleanliness are up to par  if only the food portions were a little more than offered."}
{"text":"I visited on a Sunday evening after 7pm it was about a 20 -30 min wait to be seated. I did find that the restaurant is really loud and no background music you just hear every tables conversation. Once you order your food it arrives rather quickly. I ordered the seafood combo with a side of fries, Dungeness crab and Lobster. Every thing tasted great and came hot temperature wise. The sauces I tried were Garlic Butter, Cajun And Laboil all with medium level spice. I would recommend la boil flavour for everything its the best the most flavourful you can't go wrong. The give you a bib gloves crackers and or scissors so you are fully prepared to dive in. The server was very attentive but a little annoying because she didn't need to check on us every 5 mintues"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with a group of friends. It was a Friday night around 6:30 and the 4 of us got seated right away. Server, Sophie, was friendly and went over the process of ordering together with us. 
As a group we got shrimp, snow crab legs, fries (regular and sweet potato), lobster, noodles, grilled squid and added corn and sausages. We also got 2 beers and 2 pops, and the 2 slushys (more like shaved ice for dessert). The shrimp were the stars of the show and were a good medium sized shrimp, we each ate about 2 crab legs, and the lobster was about 2 lbs, and we each got a sizeable amount. When splitting the bill evenly between 4 people, with tax and tip, it was about $43 per person. Not horrible, but not the cheapest either, then again, seafood is expensive.
Portions were great, we were all full after. We tried the Cajun, LA Boil and garlic butter seasoning, and the LA Boil was definitely the better of them. 
Will definitely come back, an overall good dining experience"}
{"text":"I've had a LOT a delicious seafood across Canada and the U.S. and this place is among the best of them. A touch expensive but that certainly doesn't mean poor value! This is not a place to just pop into for a bite. I think for such a casual visit you might want want to spend quite so much. But for a good meal consisting of amazing southern seafood, then this will be your place!

The house L.A. Boil special preparation method is a combination of garlic butter and cajun and is an absolute must. The crab legs are large and delicious, heck, as is pretty much everything... fries, lobster, oysters, shrimp, salad, squid... seriously, this is a good place!"}
{"text":"I ordered grilled squid and garlic butter shrimps- delish! We all had a great time! Our waiter was very patient to with us and took time to show us how to order using ipad. Prices are reasonable, the place was nice, clean bathrooms as well.. keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Loved this spot! Walked in around 8pm with my family, hungry for some seafood. We were surprised when we were told that you order everything on an iPad whenever you'd like (we did all you can eat). Our server, David, was amazing with helping us out throughout the process. 

If anything, I think my whole family was very impressed with their whole iPad POS system. I believe it was easier than having a bunch of menu's scattered on the table.

The design and decor here were amazing. I personally liked how the bathroom stalls were totally private (sorry, that was totally irrelevant but I just thought I'd bring it up haha).

Food here was great. We ended up staying about 2 hours (almost until close) because we could not get enough of the boils and appetizers. 

Service here was also great. Our waiter, David was super helpful and engaged with us a lot which made the night even more enjoyable.

Wish they had this back home! Thank you for the amazing food & service, L.A. Boil!"}
{"text":"I just came back from an excellent lunch at this new L A Boil restaurant. It has been open for almost a week. I had their basic seafood combo of shrimps, mussels, clams and sausages with mild house sauce plus a side order of sweet potato fries. The more I try seafood boils, the more that I want to have the mild sauce, so that the seafood flavor is not overwhelmed. The seafood was tasty. The fries were excellent. The plastic gloves fit nicely and I did not have to struggle to get them on.

This restaurant is a spin-off from 168 Sushi located next door to it. I believe that they used the same designer as 168 but the look is entirely different. The designer showed off a sense of humour on this one."}
{"text":"The best part about our experience was our server Luchen. Awesome service from him! Now for the rest of our review....Poor ambience in the front area, the bright lights make it feel like an cold warehouse.

The salad bar is LAME! it's not appealing nor plentiful. The options were  limiting. Skip the crawfish unless you like chomping on shell cause there's no meat in those little suckers.

The food was just okay. Not a special night out whatsoever. Also noted a strange choice of music for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my side of the family yesterday (wife, kids, mom, sisters, nephew etc) and the food was NOT worth it.

The food tasted great, but I have concerns about the portions.

My wife and I shared an order of lobster (garlic butter), shrimp (la boil) and veggies (garlic butter) and we were left wanting more. The lobster was small ($36 for an apparent 2lb lobster), and the veggie boil had too much okra. The shrimp portion was so-so

My mom and one sister had lobster and crab. My brother in law and other sister had lobster, crab legs and Veggies as well.

However, for the prices they charge, you eat on paper plates, eat with plastic cutlery and drink from plastic cups. 

Budget around $40 per person

Pro tip 1: try different sauces, otherwise they will all taste the same

Pro tip 2: don't order a separate veggie boil and add the veggies you want to your seafood boil. 

Pro tip 3: Save your money and go somewhere else

Will NOT be back"}
{"text":"So we were really excited to try this restaurant and we were terribly disappointed

Service - after being seated we waited for almost 10minutes for our waiter, he seemed completely disinterested in explaining to us how it worked 

Food - seafood was over cooked and served in plastic bags

Atmosphere - the place was clean but sparse"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night around 9:30 pm, we ended up waiting about 15 minutes before getting a table.

You'll notice that everything about this restaurant is similar to other \"boil\" restaurants. The bibs, the gloves, paper as a table cloth, plastic cups for water etc...

So on to the ambience and food, great atmosphere - TVs were playing the live Tragically Hip concert, great lighting and wall decor. We ordered shrimps (garlic butter), and snow crab legs (LA Boil Sauce) with potatoes and corn. The shrimps were very plump and was a good portion size, same with the crab legs. My only issue is the LA boil sauce was too oily and not flavourful enough.

The cool thing was that menus were on iPads and therefore made it easier to access and place our order. Overall, it was a good experience, servers were friendly and attentive, regularly filling our waters. I would recommend coming here if it's the closest \"boil\" option. 

OH and there's a 10% discount off all food items (Valid until Sep 30th.2016)!"}
{"text":"I went to LA Boil with my friends on a Sunday night during when they had the 50% off a lb of shrimp OR mussel per person. Of course only one order and the rest of the orders are regular price. 

Nonetheless, my friends and I in total had 2 lbs of shrimp, 2 lbs of middle, 1 lb of clams, 2 orders of Cajun fries (delicious) and then corn on the cobs about 4-5 orders.

To start, they had these cute bibs that you can draw on for yourself to be creative. served in big plastic bags - they also offer you gloves as this is a very hands-on experience!

LA Boil sauce was a mix of everything together - from Cajun to some of the other sauces, highly recommend that as a general point. I would say to get 'medium' spicy level cause the \"spicier\" you go, the more the sauce taste. 

Overall, the bill came out to be about 18 before tip per person which I thought was awesome with the event. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came here tonight, way over priced though.  I've been to places where it's $10/bag and it included some extras.  Here they charge $2 for 2 pieces of extra items.  We ordered 2 bags of clams, mussels and shrimp.  Tried the garlic butter and LA Boil sauce.  The LA Boil is a little spicy, even if you request no spice.  Salad bar didn't have much, but then again you don't go to a seafood restaurant for salad.  Best bang for the buck was the shrimp, it's a bit cheaper and you get more.  All in all, it was an ok experience."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant was poor except the friendliness of the server. The food was spiced badly. No dishes and cutlery isn't cute, it's gross! Hot food served in a plastic bag?!? I'd eat my own foot before I'd return to this place."}
{"text":"It was good, but expensive in ratio to what was ordered.  Zucchini was$1.99 or corn as side was an addition.  Ordered snow crab and clams $49"}
{"text":"Definitely recommend trying out! I love seafood and this place is like heaven for me! We had the shrimp, lobster and mussels with the LA Boil triple crazy fire sauce..soooo goood!!! Worth every penny! Although the only con is that they give you steamed rice in a plastic tub with a plastic spoon....I would have preferred real utensils. Otherwise staff were all very friendly, great atmosphere and great place for groups!"}
{"text":"Wow...what a mess...kind of fun at first but then it just gets too messy
LA BOIL special was okay..but handling it was way to hot. Get rid of the IPAD menu, just unnecessary.

Been there once, unlikely to return"}
{"text":"Value - 5/5, for lunch combos that includes A LOT of food (soup, salad, main, side) for ~$9.99, AYCE salad bar (like 6-7 items), & an additional 10% off 'til end of September  :)

Service - 5/5, served by manager himself.  Nash was very personable, enthusiastic about explaining the iPad ordering, and around when we needed him

Food - 3-3.5/5, I hafta knock down some points here because they do not know how to deep fry things.  Fries were extremely greasy, arrived shiny, so they weren't drained properly.  And as per other reviews, soft shell crab was oily, so I'm assuming they need to brush up on their deep frying and most of their apps are deep fried.

I had the lobster sandwich and it had actual CHUNKS of lobster in it, so I was impressed, especially considering the price.  I enjoyed it!

Would go back to try their boils!  It's a new restaurant, so they're looking to make an impression, so go while it's still new."}
{"text":"This place just opened I think maybe a month ago so I was really excited to try it. I saw the menu and it wasn't so different from the other boil restaurants that I've been to. The prices are a little bit more expensive than Captain's boil though. Then, our server wasn't really friendly and tried cleaning up while we still had a couple of people eating. Regarding food, hmm, the LA seasoning was kind of salty and there's bit of curry in it although it didn't say in the menu. I didn't say anything because it didn't affect the dish that much and that it was tolerable."}
{"text":"Came here for a bday party there was about 13 of us and we had reservations on a Friday evening and we were quickly seated.

Ive been to the LA Boil and had take out and it was pretty good.  Noticed on their menu here thay they do All you can eat minis lobster amd crabs.  Everything else is fair game mussels shrimps crawfish etc.  With the AYCE they not only provide the usualy seafood and sides but they also provide the food selection you would find at a sushi restaurant minus the sushi. Example beef ribs, fried rice, udon noodles, dim sim, fried chicken wings yoi get the point where i am getting at here.

Your order is placed via tablet and a server takes your tablet to approve it.  I feel doing it this way of ordering always slows down the process of your getting food in a timely manner.  Order the a ton of boiled seafood and beef robs my fave.  The flavour that i tend to enjoy in boil is the LA BOIL and the lemon pepper too bad you cant combo the flavours vs just getting LA Boil flavour which is all of the flavs combined.

Sonce there was 13 of us you get the usual problems that may occur when ordering food. Who ordered this? Where is our order and what not. Not really mad so we jus reordered and the good came in a timely fashion.
The server was cool too he brought is stuff that we thought we ordered but we didnt but we kept it anyways lol all good.

Overall the service, food and environment was really cool.  Definitely come back again with a smaller group or big group cause tjeure more than capable to ahndling their business. Keep up the good work.  

1 tip washrooms are hard to find of the doors are closed they blend well with the walls dont walk in the girls washroom by accident.

Stay classy Yelpers!!!!"}
{"text":"I come here really often for the shrimps but the past two times I came, I felt like the taste and flavour of the shrimps gotten worse.  The shrimps come in a plastic bag and usually the sauce is thick, salty and flavourful. However, the past few bags of shrimp we got were watered down and bland. We got the shrimps change but I felt like they just drained it and gave it back to us. We got it changed twice but the shrimps still had barely any flavour. They ended up giving us sauce on the side instead and you can see there is a huge consistency difference between the ones in the bag and the ones on the side. We were really disappointed since this place was our favourite go to seafood boil place. Felt like the quality went down and there was also food flies around."}
{"text":"OMG- can I just say that I think I have found my haven. 

I absolutely love seafood, and I was so happy to try this place last week. my fiancé took me on a surprise date and I am so glad we ended up here.

the atmosphere was chic and modern, and they were all ready for Halloween, with spider web decorations and other halloweeny things around. 

The menu was on a ipad, so I was just a little confused, because I am just so used to Ipad menu's at all you can eat sushi places. I asked the waitress if it was all you can eat and she showed me how to use the ipad, so the answer is no it is not all you can eat, but super cool that the menu is on an ipad, most things had a picture( aside from the dessert). 

I ordered the seafood combo that came with rice, shrip, clams, mussles and sausage, and my fiancé ordered the crawfish ( that didn't come with rice, so that was extra). for the sauce we both ordered it with the L.A boil sauce which was Cajun, garlic butter, and lemon pepper mixed together, and I got extra garlic butter on the side, which was totally worth it by the way!!

I have no complaints on the flavour or anything like that, I only wish that the serving of rice was bigger as we ran out of rice so fast.

great restaurant and I am going back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. We were a party of 3 and ordered the set for two which included 1lb of muscles, 1lb of shrimps, Seafood fried rice and Cajun fries. It was A LOT of food. We end up only finishing the muscles. Everything else had leftovers. The place was really quiet during lunch hours. Service was great too. 

As for the food, i feel like the sauce wasnt as good as i last visited. It seemed a lot water-downed/diluted. But the muscles and shrimp were huge. There was also a self serve soup&salad bar and ice cream. I had the calm chowder. But i was too full for dessert after the meal. 

No more lunch specials. Theres a new all you can eat menu, might try that next time."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while now and finally was able to last night. 

At first, I was unimpressed. Thought it was small, the salad bar was lacking, pale who came after us got food before us, etc. I can't say we ordered anything too extravagant, shrimps, mussels and crawfish. 

Our food came and oh my!! The mussels were HUGE and the flavour was incredible! We got them dressed in mild lemon pepper sauce.

The LA broil sauce was fantastic on shrimp. We actually ordered too much food and will be enjoying the rest today.

Staff was helpful and nice. They do not accept debit; I didn't see an ATM in there but I could be mistaking. 

Needless to say, the food made up for whatever was lacking. 

Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Food was great and flavorful! I ordered the Shrimp with medium sauce and LA Boil sauce. It was a great bang for your buck if you want to become full. Also tried the sausage and zucchini. Enjoyed the food....so that's the good.

The reason for my rating is my overall service experience was terrible. Came here about an hour before closing. They accommodated us with a spacious table in the corner. We had a large party of about 8, and the waiters didn't really look like they knew what they were doing.

1)  First off, it took forever for them to get our order. When we ordered beer, they were out, and decided to pour us only 2/3 of a pitcher, and decided to charge us anyway... (like, why couldn't you just tell us you guys were out of it on tap and offer us something else?!!)

2) When they dropped off the food, they also acccidently spilt the crab-leg crackers and the bucket....AND YEP. THEY WENT RIGHT AHEAD AND PICKED IT UP FROM THE GROUND AND PUT IT BACK ON THE TABLE! (HYGIENIC OR WHAT?...IDK YOU TELL ME??)

3) There was a lag on one of our friends orders about 10 minutes after everybody had gotten their food. We told the waiter to check up on the kitchen, and he did, but there was several communication errors when the shrimp actually arrived on the table between the workers. So even after the food arrived the manager, another worker, and our own waiter were confused. 

3) Wanted to speak to the manager about the split tabs but he decided to stay in the back and not even approach the table. He kept delegating to his poor staff to come to us... and even get his staff to apologize for such a 'terrible' experience. His staff screwed up our split bill about 3 times (kudos to this worker, but the manager should of at least helped since we were the last ones there... nobody else was in the restaurant). 

HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE MANAGEMENT TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER WITH SERVICE. With great food needs great service. I'm sorry."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to LA boil (Mississauga) and it was a great meal as always. they provide fast and efficient service as well as your food that would come quickly after ordering through an ipad. The seafood is always fresh and very flavourful. I would highly  recommend this restaurant  to  seafood  lovers and the experience of eating with  your  hands!"}
{"text":"We tried the mussels, lobster, shrimp adding the corn and garlic bread.  All was delicious.  Atmosphere felt a bit fast foodish and bathrooms were not very clean but service was good, food was great.  Will try it again."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 5, luckily we got the last table because there were many reservations. I liked how there was a iPad we could order from, make it more efficient for the whole table to see the menu and agree on something. We got Cajun fries, 1 lbs of: mussels, shrimp, clam & crawfish. I must say that the sauces were good but I enjoyed Cajun pepper more than the LA Boil sauce. The fries were good but I've had better. 

I must say that the service was exeptional, the servers were all attentative and nice. Their salad bar added a nice touch to the place and I kept going there haha. I recommend eating mussels with Cajun sauce with medium spice!!"}
{"text":"Service is quick and very initiative. Seafood sauce is tasty and very similar to the ones I had in US."}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely surpassed my expectations. I've been indenting to go to the captains boil in Toronto for a while now, but never got the opportunity. Once I heard that a similar restaurant opened up in Mississauga I was really stoked, but kinda expected it to be a bad version of the captains boil. Therefore my expectations were pretty low. Since its new I made a reservation...luckily! Without which I think we would have had to wait for a while. 
We were greeted and seated immediately. The server explained to us the concept and instructions on how to use the iPad menu.
We got the shrimp and crawfish with medium heat lemon pepper sauce with corn, potatoes and zuchinni. I was afraid the serving size will be quite small, so decided to order sides such as rice after getting a glimpse of the serving size. To my surprise the bag was full! Anxiously we put on our aprons and gloves (which are definitely needed) and dug in. It was really enjoyable and messy! 
The shrimp were extremely filling and is a good choice if you're starving. I would stay away from the crawfish if you're hungry, since extracting the meat from them was a slow and tedious process and very minimal meat can be obtained after each struggle.
The medium spice level was perfect- not too spicy but has a mild lingering heat. By the end we were stuffed as ever. 
The prices are quite steep, but worth it. Plus, we got the 10% off from their promotion.
The service was very friendly and efficient, and our food appeared within 7-10 minutes. 
I really hope this good experience wasn't as a result of it being a new restaurants, and hope they maintain it throughout. 
I will visit again for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3-4 times with my family and for a birthday party! It's a pretty nice restaurant but get ready to eat with your hands (they do supply gloves and bibs) it's fun to eat with your hands once in a while. The food you order comes in a bag filled with the sauce and you just take the food from there!! The only problem I have is the price (really expensive for each bag of food). The food in the bag may sound weird but it's really not!! I also had the dessert and I would not buy it because it relatively expensive for just shave ice and the topping. Overall, I would definitely come back again!! :)"}
{"text":"The lunch special sounded great. For 10-12 bucks you get a lot of food. But was it worth it? Indeed, not! 

I was surprised that most items were served in plastic. The clam chowder soup came with a huge spoon in a take out container and it wasn't smooth and creamy. The taste wasn't right too. 

The all you can eat salad bar is ridiculously small and nothing for you to go back for seconds. Definitely not worth getting up for. Since there are flies everywhere due to the seafood atmosphere, the salad bar was out in the open for any creatures!!  

The main entree came quickly as we both ordered lobster roll for $12 with Cajun sweet potato fries. Glad that it actually had lobster meat but the bread was the biggest disappointment of all. It was stale, not grilled or toasted and it broke lose easily. I felt I was eating a week's old bread!!! Yuck! 

The fries was not spicy and crispy at all. No matter the large portion of it, it was a waste! 

The good thing is that they had their iPad system of ordering so you saw a better image of what your food would look like.  And the service was decent. 

Verdict:  Eating out of a bag? Sharing with other creatures?? Nope, not for me and I wouldn't go back. This Cat has a higher standard!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice restaurant. I'm a regular at this seafood boil restaurant. Been visiting pretty often. Love the sauce they have for their seafoods. I usually order the Cajun sauce. But the LA boil sauce is pretty good too. I prefer their sauces over Capital Boil. 

They offer a variety of different types of seafood. They have shrimps, crabs, lobsters,mussels and etc. They also have vegetable and chicken that you can add to your order. If you prefer other things. They also have rice dishes, sandwiches, soup and a variety of fried foods. 

I usually order the shrimp and they are usually pretty fresh. But sometimes they don't drain them properly so the sauce is kinda diluted. So I sometime order extra sauce on the side. 

Overall, nice places. Recommended if you like Captain boil. This place is better."}
{"text":"Stopped in with the family for dinner on a Tuesday night.  The place was very busy for a Tuesday, probably in because this location just opened up, and were offering 10% off for the first couple weeks. Our party of 7 ordered, 2 lbs of shrimp (12.99/lb), 2 lbs of lobster (36.99), 1 lb of snow crab (18.99/lb) and 1 lb of crayfish (16.99/lb), as well as garlic bread (3.99 for 3 pieces), fries (3.99) and Cajun fries (4.99), and calamari (4.99).

The appetizers were terribly underwhelming and very much over priced. The garlic bread was 3 small pieces of bread with a bit of garlic butter on it. both fries were a small serving and the calamari was only 6 pieces. I would suggest skipping anything on their menu that is fried.

The mains were served in a plastic bag. So this is definitely not a place for a date and no for someone who doesn't like to get a bit messy. A bib and gloves were provided to help save your clothes.

I just wasn't impressed by any of the seafood, some felt over cooked while others were just boring. I think that a lot of people will visit LA Boil in its first few weeks because of the novelty of the dining experience. I don't see too many return guests."}
{"text":"Service was quick. Messy eating but fun. Tasty shellfish, Cajun fries and Seafood fried rice was very good.
Washrooms dark and filthy, always a turn-off."}
{"text":"We had a girls night at L.A Boil and thoroughly enjoyed our seafood dinner.

We went on a Wednesday so we didn't have to wait for seating at all. The restaurant is really big and spacious. When we were seated our server came by and explained how to use their iPad menu. It's the exact same concept as Sushi 168 and Heart Sushi besides it not being AYCE. We were told the owners of Sushi 168 owns L.A Boil.

We all ordered the seafood combo with fries. Additionally, my sister and I got the snow crab legs. We all opted to choose the regular spice L.A Boil sauce. My friend and I can't handle spice very well but were able to eat our seafood. It was a very delicious and fun experience. I will definitely return!

PS: 10% discount until end of September"}
