{"text":"My wife and I did a room on a date night. Our only mistake was that we booked a hard room which would usually require 6-8 people and there was 2 of us, so we weren't successful.  But it was a really neat experience that tested our minds...will try again. 

Best part of our date was actually the cafe after, which wasn't all that special other than they had hundreds of board games which were a lot of fun to play while drinking coffee. In a world where we are attached to our electronic devices this was a refreshing evening as a couple where we truly unplugged and had fun together."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and well-themed rooms. There are a tonne of board games to choose from! The only complaint I have is the limited number of rooms available, and no rooms with a horror theme. Some sound/ambient effects for the rooms would also be nice."}
{"text":"Group of 3- we did the DeTriad room. A lot of the puzzles were too straightforward and fairly easy. We finished with lots of time to spare. I did like that they gave you the option of whether you wanted a clue or not. Overall though,  I expected more from this place given the reviews and the price."}
{"text":"It was my first time playing room-escape and I LOVED it!

My cousins and I were able to decode the Ancient Mystery and we escaped! The level of hardness for that particular room was medium, but your team can choose the playing mode - guiding, challenging, or insane (unlimited hints, one hint, or no hints at all). 

I know a lot of people who have played room-escape and everybody simply tells me, \"You are all stuck in a room, and you have to solve puzzles to escape.\" I really did not know what to expect.

I was pleasantly surprised when I stepped into the game room we chose. It was quite obvious that a lot of thought, as well time and effort, were put into every aspect of the game. From the concept and theme of that particular room to the visuals to the puzzles.

The entire facility is HUGE. They already have 3 rooms open, and I heard they are working on another one. You can easily book the room and the time of your choice on their website (www.decodecanada.com) or give them a call. There is also a large area with tables and chairs in the back with a shelf full of board games. They serve drinks, and they are planning to serve food soon, too. It is a great place to hang out with friends before and after playing room-escape, and even if you are there just to play their board games.

The staff is very welcoming and friendly. They will even take the time to explain how to play a particular board game to you, as long as they know how to play it. 

We all had a wonderful time, and we cannot wait until we're back to decode their other rooms!

( If you have never played room-escape, you must try it out at De Code! I don't want to spoil the fun for you by explaining what the theme has to do with the puzzles, and all the wonderful details... You really just have to check it out for yourself. I am sure you won't regret it! )"}
{"text":"I did the \"Board Game\" room with 8 people for my birthday. We had a lot of fun trying to figure out the room. The only thing I was a little disappointed it was the aesthetics of the room, it was a little cheap looking, so it took away from the ambiance a little bit. Over all we had a lot of fun and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"So my group played the Ancient Mystery room, which is by reputation their best room. I actually thought the room was very good. I'd give it a three and a half if I could. 

The room itself in terms of difficulty, logic, and theme was very good (4.5/5)

The location is awful. The facility itself is good, but unless you live on the West End getting there is a pain (it's on the far end of Mississauga).

That in itself wouldn't be so bad, but it's priced itself into the upper echelon of escape rooms. With all discounts available it still came to over $22 per person for a 45 minute game! This makes it one of the most expensive facilities on a per minute basis in the entire GTA and since I can't imagine the rent being comparable to the downtown, midtown or even uptown facilities I brought the review down from a four to a three. 

Don't get me wrong, you'll have a very good time, but unless you're in Mississauga to start with you can find better, cheaper, more centrally located escape games."}
{"text":"De Code is one of my favourite room escapes in the GTA.

The facility is really spacious and a lot of work is put into making the entire place seem inviting. The waiting and board games area are both spacious, well-lit and clean, which some of De Code's competitors cannot claim.

The room we were in also gave the same impression of being polished and well-presented. Decorations were in abundance without seriously distracting from the puzzles. The challenge itself was as fiendishly difficult as advertised. We weren't even close to saving the world. Whoops.

My group really appreciated the free drink and photo memento you receive afterward (if you like or check in on Facebook or something). The photo was taken with some fun props, then printed and put into a very spiffy room-themed frame while you wait and down your drink and play board games. We're definitely looking at coming back to collect the other photo frames!"}
{"text":"I had a great time at De Code. I went with 5 friends, and each of us had never tried a room escape before. We did the Child's Play room as the other rooms were booked and Ancient Mystery was unavailable. 

Since it was our first time we had a little bit of trouble getting started but eventually started to figure things out. One of the clues was missing in the room so one of the staff members had to go and grab a replacement for us, but other than that it was set up really nicely and was lots of fun. 

Everyone was really nice and they offer for you to stay after your 45 minutes is up to play board games, have photos taken and grab something to eat. A great experience all around and I will be back to try out the other rooms!"}
{"text":"Fun new escape room entertainment in Mississauga. In a bit of an obscure location but the concept is quite creative and unique. I think they just newly opened in February. It's about $30 per person but I took advantage of a 50% deal.

You work in as a team to gather clues and try to unlock into the next room until you escape. There is some level of difficulty, although if you try the unlimited hint mode it is helpful enough for you to get out (which is what we did). I think my only comment is that in the \"hint\" mode, the hints the staff provide you make it pretty obvious to solve the problem at hand. Also, maybe it's just my preference, but there's only 1 way to solve the riddle and move on (essentially either you get it right or wrong). If only they could make it so that you can solve things using more than 1 logic/approach/tactic, then that is ideal (although that requires more creative thinking on their part!).

The ultimate plus is you get access to 3 hours of board game play after your 45 minute escape room session! Nice way to lounge after, hang out with your friends for some good adult fun without it being food-related and without everyone being stuck on their phones. They have a nice variety of games. The staff are very friendly and accommodating, although there is no food/drinks. You can ask for water though."}
{"text":"This was a fun evening of board games. We only tried the board game cafe, but it looked like the escape room part was also popular. The ambiance was kind of high school, but it didn't matter because everyone was having fun. Parking seemed to constantly be full so you may need to park at a nearby business and walk over.  The location is a commercial/manufacturing district, as I suppose rent will be cheaper than the popular retail areas. The game selection was not as impressive as Toronto caf√©s but had the popular games people want to play. There were plenty of people playing but there was no wait to get a table and the tables can be pushed together for bigger groups. We tried Logo, Sushi Go, Hive, and finished off with a fast paced game of Hungry Hippos. There were people of all ages there, but mostly university age. The bathrooms were basic, bright and clean. The staff were attentive, but not necessarily informative about the games. There is also a selection of food and drinks (no outside food or drinks allowed). There is a kitchen so hot food is served too. We tried the puff pastries which was actually a nice dessert. Prices were much like restaurant prices, slightly over priced but they need to make money somewhere right?  To play was only $2 per person, that included a little tray of potato chips and bottomless glasses of tap water.  We'll go again.

Returned a week later and sadly the price increased 300% to $2/hour per person. Needless to say, it was dead there this time around. The few people that showed up while we were there for three hours either left before the second hour or were not playing and just waiting for the escape rooms.  We tried the strawberry milkshake, it was very good. The small bowl of chips per person was still complementary.  Sorry but it's now over priced compared to what I expect."}
{"text":"Attended for a corporate function where the entire facility was reserved for our team building.  I have been to pretty low budget and better scaled escaped rooms in the GTA.  De Code ranks closer to the better scaled, as the staff was super friendly, super informative, and very clear on all the instructions.  A great event, everyone had a fantastic time!"}
{"text":"First off, the location itself is a minus one star.  Do people actually come here?  It's in what seems like an industrial area.  Definitely off the beaten path, but what do I know?  I don't live in Mississauga and I'm not familiar with this neck of the woods.  

We happened to make the trek out here to meet with some friends for lunch and then we decided to come check this place out.  

The price seemed a bit more expensive than other room escape locations.  However, with online booking, a like on FB, and check-in on FB, the price came down to about $20 a person.  That was more reasonable.  

The room itself was pretty good.  It was the gaming room which could accommodate our group of seven adults plus small child.  I think we could've used more time.  It's hard to focus when you have a 2 year old moving game pieces around!  :P

I liked the option to stay after your room escape.  There's a huge space in the back with board games galore!  They also have a menu with some drinks and food Items.  I didn't think it was necessary to charge us an additional fee to stay on longer, especially when it was completely dead for a Sunday afternoon.  Let us linger a bit and hang out.  Instead, we were told to make a purchase or pay up.  We left.  

Overall, we had fun.  Would I come back?  Highly unlikely since it's in the middle of nowhere.  If you live in Mississauga though, this would be a decent place to spend some time.  Just make sure you get all the discounts and don't pay regular price."}
{"text":"Great place to find out how much of a quick thinker you really are ! Great waiting lounge and friendly stuff. Try to be on time ! Otherwise your stuff waiting till the room frees up"}
{"text":"I've heard quite a lot about these gaming and board game hangouts and decided to try one out. I was in the immediate area on a Friday night and so we stopped in around 930pm. The Board Game Cafe is $2 per person for unlimited play, and includes glasses of water and a bowl of chips or popcorn. They also have a dessert/refreshment menu to order from, but we chose not to as we just came from dinner.

There was well over 100 board games to choose from, and what I liked was that they had duplicates of the very popular games.

Considering its basically an industrial unit in a dark, dungy area, it was pretty warm and comfortable inside. These places tend to be cold and impossible to climate control, but it wasn't here. The staff checked on us frequently and we had a great time. For $2 each, you can't really go wrong.

We didn't try the escape rooms but we saw the reactions from several people who came in and out of them, typically playing board games after their escape room experience ended, and we heard nothing but good things."}
{"text":"This place was great and the room was fun as well. The difficulty level was five and we were able to make it pretty far according to the owners as compared to most people. He said this is one of the hardest rooms in the GTA. That's crazy to me. It was a fun room it was called the board game room and there was quite a lot going on. The only thing I wish we would've gotten were the instructions in our hand instead of having to find it in the room because we are confused for the first 10 minutes after what we should be doing anyway.

It was fun but I do wish there was more ventilation in the room as it was a bit musty"}

{"text":"I actually proposed to my girlfriend at De Code, and I really couldn't imagine it working out any better. Shane and Greg from the De Code team helped me every step of the way. 

Shane actually surprised us with a photoshoot as well! Just amazing. 

It helped that the escape room was engaging and fun to solve as well. Definitely would go again!"}
{"text":"I went 3 weeks ago for a friend's birthday celebration. If you pre-book online and use Facebook check-in, they'll give you a discount which makes the price pretty reasonable, though I haven't compared with other places with the same concept. 

We were given the option of breaking into a room or breaking out, and had to pick one of three difficulty levels. We chose to break out and to go with medium difficulty. After being given instructions, a backstory, and the first clue, we were put into a room and tasked with getting out before time runs out. We had fun and some \"aha\" moments as we went from one clue to another. 

My group and I ultimately struggled and ran out of time, which I'd like to blame on it being unclear on the order of the clues. There are plenty of pictures on Facebook showing teams that were successful though, so maybe it's actually on us that we couldn't get out. Maybe.

All in all, it was fun - I think it's worth a visit if you live in Mississauga but I wouldn't go again very soon, maybe some time down the line.

Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Definitely a really good escape room. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. 

Only downside is, this is one of the more expensive escape rooms. However, I definitely recommend it! Expensive for a reason!!!

You do get discounts for checking in on Facebook, and booking online etc.

I couldn't actually book online, because my card kept getting rejected, but they still honored us the discount which was very nice!!!!"}
{"text":"This De Code Adventures is located in Mississauga, just off the 401. Lots of parking, when you get in, there are lockers on the side and you get up to the counter.

They ask you to sign a liability waiver, and offer you 10% off if you like, or follow them on social media.

This was my first time doing something like this and it won't be my last. Loved it, the manager seems very hyped up and sells the place really well - the stories are rated by level of difficulty.

This was awesome! 4/5"}
{"text":"I went here last night with a group of friends and was disappointed. This was my first visit to De Code, but my third escape room experience. If you have done escape rooms before, I wouldn't recommend going here, however if it's your first one, then this place offers a decent introduction. Our room was small and a little worse for wear. One of the props in our room broke halfway through and had to be restarted by our game master, which killed the vibe. That said, the staff was really friendly, helpful and accommodating."}
{"text":"My second time here and it was yet another amazing time. We almost made it !! We will defiantly come back again. The details in each room was amazing and it was a good challenge."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different, because I had never done an escape room before. It was pretty fun! 

I found it very difficult and didn't even know where to start in the beginning, and needed to be guided for almost every clue. But in saying that I will definitely go back for more. It's a fun way to spend an afternoon or evening, and then play boardgames in the game room after."}
{"text":"I have tried a few of the rooms at DeCode, they have all been fairly well organized and the puzzles have been pretty straight forward. They offer discounts if you like them on facebook, book online in advance and have a group of more than 6 people. 

Played De Triad Code (cops and robbers scenerio) with a group of people for a birthday, it was a lot of fun playing against the other team! Looking forward to trying their other rooms"}
{"text":"Had a blast. Came in a group of 6 and even though I struggled to keep up i was still able to have fun.  Only thing that's not so good is they only have 5 games once you played them all they don't have much else to offer. Other then the board game room in the back. 

They has a snack menu but I didn't order."}
{"text":"Thank you for a great time as usual! This place always offer amazing service and we always have so much fun.  We always play the board games and get the drinks and chips. The rooms are greatly decorated!! Thank you again!!"}
{"text":"I've been to De Code Adventures to three times already and each experience has been a blast! The puzzles are challenging and sometimes, you wish you had more than 45 minutes to solve them. I love to attention to detail and the fun themes of each room. Room escape is tons of fun. Grab a few friends and give it a try!"}
{"text":"We regularly visit decode for board games. Always a good time!! Plenty selection for food, drinks and games!! The staff of sideways friendly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I should note I didn't eat anything at this visit 
I came for an event (board game night with an organization). I have never been to a board game cafe before so I'm not sure what I was expecting. Maybe more games? 
There were a few shelves that had games neatly stacked (which was nice), but many of the games were confusing and not very enjoyable, especially for kids. They did have the classics, but only one of each, so I'm not sure what they do when more than one group wants to play those. Find something else I guess. Overall not impressed with the selection. The space itself was decent and well suited for games + eating. 
It seems that this place also has the decode rooms, so that would have been cool to check out. 
Overall I can only comment on the game room aspect and it was just okay."}
{"text":"I have been to 3 escape rooms so far and decode I would rank as number 1.

Variety: There at least 3 diff rooms you can try with a smaller group OR if you have a bigger group you can do a cops vs robbers where both groups are in a competition against the other.

Creativity: I have only tried one room (the science one) and it was fun. I won't give details about the room but in terms of easy/medium/hard, it would be around the medium level. Need to be quick and observant. I also enjoy the fact the give the option of unlimited hints till the last clue or just one hint or none.

Service: De Code personnel are very approachable.  helpful, and friendly.  

Bonus: they have a big board game cafe in the back. it's 5$ per person for 3 hours. You get a decent variety of board games to choose from. After 45 mins of either succeeding or failing, you and your group can chill here with some board games (settlers, anomia, apples to apples, they are in the process of getting cargs against humanity, etc) while drinking or eating desserts from their menu.

If there had to be a con somewhere, i would say coz of the location. maybe the rent is better (coz it is a big place) but accessing it is difficult if you are commuting as it is not in a \"prime\" area. Even using GPS one can get lost. 

With that being said, if you and group are in the Mississauga neighborhood and are looking for a fun time, please try De Code Adventures. Whether its the escape rooms or the board game cafe, i'm sure you will have a fun time!"}
{"text":"This place was a blast!!!! Came here for a social event with work peeps. We had groups of 5 per room. I had my reservations because i was nervous I wouldn't be much help for my group but it was so much fun! The place was clean, friendly staff and provided lockers for purses, phones, keys.
 We had an hour to crack our code and could get a hint if we were stuck. Although we didnt pass.....it was exciting and a great time. I would love to go back and try the other rooms."}
{"text":"This was my second visit here and I just thought I should mention how much fun I have here. The staff is super friendly, the games are challenging but fun, this is an activity that will definitely test friendships but in the best way. It definitely doesn't hurt when you successfully escape the room, your ego will surely increase, which is exactly what happened last sunday! I would certainly recommend this!"}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us enjoyed our Sunday afternoon at De Code today. It's a great alternative when you want to hang with your friends and do something interactive. What I liked is that they can deduct your rate if you did the online booking for your friends. Therefore, you don't need every single person paying you back. We arrived about half an hour early so the friendly staff brought us to their game room. 

There are plenty of board and card games to choose from while you wait. What I liked was that the staff member explained the rules of the game and watched us through a round of Sushi Go. He was friendly and answered any questions that we had. We were  also provided water during our wait. 

We chose the scientific room today and unfortunately didn't even make it to the second room LOL. I guess we should've chosen the easy mode where we would get unlimited hints. After the 45 minutes we were taken back to the game room where our picture was taken.

The majority of us enjoyed the concept of escaping the room. However, some felt like it was a waste of their money because we didn't get very far. I will definitely come back and try a different room on easy mode haha."}
