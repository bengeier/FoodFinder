{"text":"Let me start by saying, I liked this place very much. I've been to the market; although a limited selection and somewhat pricy, I have enjoyed what I purchased. I like where they are trying to go with the concept of this place, but the delivery is severely lacking.

I went to their \"movie in the meadows\" event last night to watch Elf with a couple of friends and this review is specifically for that experience.

No food trucks as advertised, but they were serving their own food which was their ultimate undoing. We jumped in line 45 minutes before the movie was supposed to start thinking that would be plenty of time. Spoiler: it was not. The wait to order and receive food ended up being over 1.5 hours. They started the movie while many customers were still waiting on their food that was ordered so we all ended up missing half of the movie. 

My friends and l all ordered the tri-tip grilled cheese and tomato soup. We watched the grilled cheese sit on the griddle for like 25 minutes. It's almost un-American to not know that grilled cheese takes around 5 minutes to make. We also watched one of the cooks put a sheet pan on the floor and then use it to cover our sandwiches to melt the cheese. All of our sandwiches were burned to hell and mine did not have any tri-tip at all. It was so overcooked, the bread just crumbled like bitter dust. The chimichurri on the side was also very weird tasting. They were sold out of hot apple cider, among several other items. The soup was ok, but extremely hot and burned my mouth. Clearly, that one was my fault. 

They were charging $20 for bean bag rentals which is just nuts. I saw one at Target selling for $15.

I don't even think they did the ugly sweater competition, but I could have missed that while waiting for food.

They need far better kitchen management before trying to pursue this type of event again. If you didn't get food, this might have been an ok experience, but that totally spoiled the night for us.

I don't mean to be cheap about it, but honestly, I feel like my friends and I should be refunded $54 ($24 for 3 tri-tip grilled cheese & $30 for 3 Groupon movie tickets)."}
{"text":"Amazing little gem! Located just behind Big Surf Waterpark in Tempe this place has it all! Beautiful cafe with the best patio in AZ, farmers market on the weekends, acres of grass for the kiddos to run around on. My favorite is the homemade cinnamon rolls!"}
{"text":"My experience here was amazing! My cappuccino was delicious and spot on! Picked up some local cinnamon honey, chocolate chip cookie, granola, and a Christmas tree!! How awesome is that? Staff are super friendly with great customer service. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Our first time. Friendly people. Great, fresh food. Wonderful, casual, outdoor atmosphere. Smiles all around!"}
{"text":"So this is also still called Singh Meadows which confused me at first- but a fantastic spot for a weekend morning with our family and friends and kids! We got coffee with cinnamon rolls and quiche which were delicious- but we also bought from the beautiful farm produce which was all ginormous! We will definitely be getting one of their large produce baskets in the future, very nice that you don't have to sign up for long term like many co-ops, you can order the week of on Facebook. Amazing set up for a relaxing morning with the lawn and lawn games, lots of room to spread out and not feel like you are in a crowd. We will likely be returning with our dog sometime too as it is doggy friendly. Last but not least we were greeted by Singh himself! This is a new favorite and I will be returning before it gets too hot!"}
{"text":"This spot is truly a hidden gem. The hand crafted foods / pastries / honeys in the market are addictive; the juice bar is healthy, organic, and delightful; the restaurant / cafe menu is delicious. Plus it's all set outdoors next to an idyllic lake, green grass for miles, and some winding pedestrian / bike paths. Absolutely loved it. Will bring the dogs and the bicycles next time."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem tucked behind Big Surf. I had no idea! You can even ride your bike in from the Rio Salado Park and land right on the back patio (dog friendly btw!). It's so serene with the sounds of birds chirping and the view of the old golf pond. There were tables and lounge chairs set up near the water. We chose to sit in the shade since it was 100 degrees outside. I had the Calabacitas & quinoa salad - extremely refreshing on a summer day. My brother and husband both ordered the cheesy veggie burger; I stole a bite and almost devoured the whole thing. Next time I'll get one for myself. The lemonade was absolutely amazing to sip on. We perused the organic produce afterwards and bought some truly juicy watermelons, canary melons, and a bag of the coconut pecans. I ate the pecans in one day because they're that good. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Singh Meadows is one of South Scottsdale/Tempe's hidden gems. Beautiful farmers market, restaurant/coffee shop and greenbelt. Mr. Singh makes every visit personal, like you're coming home to family, as does his extraordinary staff. If you haven't been, it's a must try, and once you do, it will become part of your \"must do\" weekend outings. Great place for families (including fur-babies) to relax and enjoy the day."}
{"text":"Great good in a wonderful atmosphere. Perfect for a weekend brunch while lounging outside in the beautiful field and then pick up some fresh bread, fruits, sauces, cheese, or vegetables to make a quick dinner or snacks at home."}
{"text":"This place is SO cute. Today was my first time ever visiting - or even hearing about it - but I am so happy I did. It's a cute property with a nice big field attached to it & they host different events which I'm looking forward to attending more of. 

Tonight I attended one of the Movies At The Meadows which is essentially a movie showing with a ginormous screen placed on the field. It's a similar concept to drive in movies but instead of cars, everyone sits on the grass. The venue offers bean bags for sitting which is what I rented for $20 extra, + they had their kitchen open throughout the entire movie which was amazing. (I am not a huge pizza person, but I am not kidding when I say they baked one of the most delicious pizzas I have ever tasted. I will definitely be having it again.)

Although the location is sort of hidden, it's a beautiful place with lots to offer. My experience was nothing short of great."}
{"text":"Fresh goat milk, tomato jam and out-of-the-oven pizza! Delicious place to bring OOT guests or meet up with friends while enjoying their lush green grounds in the shade. Kids love petting the goats and running around the huge grounds. A lot more space than their previous location off the 101 and everyone is so nice and inviting. Visit weekly as they close for the season once it gets hot out."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed having lunch at the meadows here that Ken Singh started.  Come, meet and talk with community people.   Great way to spend a few hours!  Love what Mr. Singh is doing."}
{"text":"Everything is great! Except the old grumpy lady at the store...I hope she had just a bad day and she does better with other costumers, the kids from the juices are super nice and relaxed, they thought about the details and are helpful and friendly, but gosh this lady...she definitely needs a costumer service classes!"}
{"text":"Under new management.  This was a farmers market.  Now great organic food choice within the restaurant.  Fresh brew coffee and sit by the open fire pit.  The lush grounds offer  grassy areas for a picnic even a beautiful pond.  Worth a trip out for a family lunch with room for the kids to roam.  This event venue is beautiful.  This is one to watch!"}
{"text":"This place has classed up the area! Very cute serene atmosphere with fire pits, a pond, outdoor day bed and just nicely maintained green grass that's very nice to walk around in bare feet! Love it"}
{"text":"Fun, relaxing
And
Beautiful spot. We've been twice on Fridays for
Lunch. Pizzas are
Good. Singh
Burger is popular with our family. Produce at farmers market looks
Very fresh and
Nice although I haven't actually
Bought/tried anything yet. My favorite menu item so far is the kohl-slaw!"}
{"text":"Amazing little find. 

Fresh food and great relaxing ambiance. Old golf course that was turned into great breakfast and brunch spot. Picnic tables and a little lake for the dogs. 

Kinda hidden. If you are going south on Miller from mckellips, it's the right, right after Oceanside and big surf then dead ahead. 


Did I mention it's dog friendly?!"}
{"text":"We love this place, and sorry Singh couldn't complete his dream. Still has great produce. 
This week corn, coming up watermelon! Great cafe with creative foods and drinks as well."}
{"text":"It was a pleasant surprise. They have a great selection of fresh produce and delicious looking breads and unlike a lot of other farmers markets their prices were excellent. My wife ordered a vegetarian cheese burger from their  kitchen and said it was excellent. I'm a carnivore so passed....lol. What makes this place unique is that it overlooks what used to be a golf course and now it's open to the public to stroll around the lush green fields. A great place to bring the kids and let them run around and enjoy mother nature. I highly recommend you visit before it gets too hot"}
{"text":"Tempe Meadows does NOT disappoint. Everything from the breakfast sandwich to the quiche to the flatbreads are unbelievably tasty! Oh wait, the pastries too. B O M B! Don't forget all of the fresh veggies available and take home treats to-go! Enough said."}
{"text":"Our first visit was amazing! The outdoors areas are beautiful! There are blankets you can use so we enjoyed a picnic lunch! The menu options are vegetarian and delicious.; we had the beet kale salad and the Asian salad. Both delicious. We bought beer chips and granola to take home. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just down the street from the noisy Tempe Marketplace shopping mall and behind Big Surf waterpark is this relaxing little getaway. Tempe Medows is something really special.

I love coming here to pick up fresh made bread, honey, homemade puddings and spreads. It's just like a farmer's market but indoors and away from the heat! Fresh produce, locally sourced products, and garden plants are also readily available for purchase. 

They have a full kitchen and an indoor/outdoor seating area where they serve breakfast and brunch. The outdoor seating area looks like it shares space with the neighboring golf course. There's a huge pond, plenty of soft green grass, and ample places to sit and enjoy the scenery with the family. On their menu, I can't get enough of their fresh made warm biscuits smothered in honey and butter! Pair anything with their housemade juices or smoothies and it's absolute heaven.

Don't pass up on this hidden gem! The workers here are so sweet and down to Earth. Making a visit here will certainly brighten your day!"}
{"text":"This is a very peaceful place to pick up fresh produce, a veggie burger, a hot citrus honey, organic beverages, or borrow a blanket from the store to lay down in the meadow.  There are large green inviting spaces for families to play and spend quality time together.  Special events like wedding, private and corporate groups take place here year-round.  Birds love it  here as well!  Melodious bird sounds surround this happy meadow of Tempe. Family of birds also share the grounds with the humans.  We saw many birds frolicking on the grass.  Tempe Meadow AKA Singh Meadow is an environmental accomplishment. It used to be  a golf course that ran out of money (like they all do).  Today it is a bowl of fresh air for all to enjoy. It produces bountiful produce grown respectful of Mother Nature.  It makes organic dishes and beverages respectful of our body and mind. I am thankful and we should all take time to re-energize at the Meadows in Tempe. Free to visit and your body & mind will thank you!"}
{"text":"Beautiful outdoor space with tons of room for kids and dogs to run around. Good coffee and espresso and a nice selection of juice and pastries. There's also a farmer's market on the weekends that has a decent selection, and a menu of hot dishes. Check it out early for some privacy or in the late morning to see it when it's popping."}
{"text":"My wife and I come to Tempe Meadows at least once every weekend. Food is absolutely delicious. Try the Biscuit 'Wich for breakfast. You won't be disappointed. For lunch, the veggie burger is amazing. I'm a major meat eater but the veggie burger is outstanding. The pastry's and breads are all homemade and sooo good! On certain nights, they have a giant inflatable screen and they show your favorite movies! They even serve beer and wine!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here on the weekends with our 6 month old daughter! They have the most delicious food and we love their coffee. Oh, and their pastries are AMAZING! There's so much gorgeous green grass for kids to run around on and they provide free outdoor blankets so you can order your food and have a picnic. We're looking forward to going to the outdoor movie tonight!"}
{"text":"Their farmer's market basket is such a treat; it feels like Christmas when we sort through the basket to find about 20 different varieties of fruit and veg.  We love eating here or having a fresh juice and looking out on the lawns.  They supply picnic blankets, hula hoops, and a hippety hop.  Life doesn't get much better than this!"}
