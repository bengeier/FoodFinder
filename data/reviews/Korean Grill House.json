{"text":"Friday night, there's a long line up b/w 7-8. We (2ppl) got there just before the rush i think so got seated down pretty quickly.   we had the AYCE and added the option for shrimp and lamb, we like lamb. service is not the warmest but it's only b/c there're so many tables there to serve! i can see that the waiters were always runing back and forth for things, and once you get their attention, they do get what you want. so ok for us.  chicken was pretty good, didn't have too much port, beef tonge and rib was good, lamb was good, squid was too small, salmon and shrimp were just the normal frozen ones, but i guess we were not there to taste the freshness of sea, so meh. they gave a lot of kimchi and rice too... i see alot of people eating rice which i don't understand!! why do you go to AYCE and eat a full bowl of rice??!! ask for tea or water if it gets salty, or just have less rice...   all in all, ok for a place to fill your meat cravings, but that's it."}
{"text":"The food here was wonderful! It was great bringing friends here. We had a moody waiter; who did not want to answer much of our questions; but the food was so delicious, it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here last night for the late night all-you-can eat grill. It goes from 10:00pm 'til closing (midnight) for 9.99$ The meats are the same as lunch (beef, chicken, pork, squid, fish filet) and soooo delicious. It also comes with the usual side dishes and rice. Service was great and food was amazing as usual. Yum yum in my tum :)"}
{"text":"Love the concept, obviously love the food! Price is compariable. It was fun, different, great time!"}
{"text":"April 5/13 Three of us walked up here after the Jays game. We didn't have a reservation, and the place was jumping, but we got a seat very quickly. We don't know 'real' Korean BBQ from 'fake', but we did like this place. We liked the chicken and beef the best, but the squid is the most fun to cook! Get the veggies and pineapple rings for $3 a person - it really adds to the meal! We had the $9.95 each all-you-can-eat and left stuffed. The service was fine: friendly; prompt; helpful and cheerful. Tell them if you've never been before. They'll explain things and it helps. We'll be back with friends from out of town to show them a fun, late-night nosh!  (The premises were clean and we did not smell like BBQ when we left.)."}
{"text":"I can put on a nose cone and paste feathers all over my body, but I still ain't a bird.  Much like Korean grill house can serve up low quality meat that you cook yourself at a table, but it still ain't Korean BBQ.   Basically the Mandarin of Korean food.   And that's being generous."}
{"text":"I love dining out and I love cooking, but Korean Grill House has shown me that those are two loves that in my case should not be combined. It was never high on my list of places I wanted to try in Toronto but my brother was in town the other night and was just dying to try this place so I conceded.   The place was busy but not packed and we were seated quickly. In general the service was reasonable but not overly impressive. For the AYCE option they give you papers to write your orders on, however they forgot to give them to us until our third round of ordering. They also forgot to replenish a couple of the side dishes we ordered.   As far as the food is concerned I don't recommend going if you're not into red meat. They do have chicken - which was ok but took forever to cook, salmon - which was my favourite but nothing special, and fish fillets - which I did not enjoy at all. My brother and wife both enjoyed the beef and pork and were even adventurous enough to try the tongue and liver.   Korean Grill house gets 2 stars from me, 3 from my wife, and 4 from my brother so I went with the average. I will not go back."}
{"text":"first time here, the environment is nice, and looks clean. Dinner AYCE is $16+ pp, the meat selection is ok, but not a lot, however all meat is marinated in the same way, so taste the same. and the quality of the meat is not impressed. no traditional  korean pesto available, and the side dish does not even close to the standard. I feel its not exactly a korean grill if the pesto and side dish is not right, it is more a AYCE grill.  another problem is they don't change the grill plate unless customer ask.   the bright side is the service is not bad, especially their young staffs.  we got what we asked pretty quickly."}
{"text":"I have been going to Korean Grill House for over 12 years, before it was rebranded as Korean Grill House. It has always been a reliable source of tasty affordable Korean BBQ. While other Korean BBQ places have come and gone in the area, Korean Grill House is consistently busy. I'm addition to the staples, very tasty ribs, salmon, sausage, beef, Korean Grill House has the tastiest proprietary blend of soy sauce which I have been unable to find elsewhere. They have also recently improved their service significantly. I highly recommend Korean Grill House."}
{"text":"A small spider at my table - the guy killed it and whisked it away like nothing ever happened."}
{"text":"If you wanna stuff your face with meat this is the place to go. I've been here twice for lunch and I don't think I've had a more filling $10 sit down lunch anywhere else. The side dishes are good as well. The service could be a little bit better but I wouldn't classify it as being horrible."}
{"text":"This was my first dinner in Toronto. Awesome place for Korean BBQ!  We got the AYCE (All You Can Eat) and for only $13.95!!!  You cannot beat that - not even in Chinatown itself!!!  The servers were quick to refill our bowls of food and water.   Service was great! Food was delish! Definitely coming back when I go back to the Maple Leafs ay!"}
{"text":"Big problem.  They opened this close to home and I need to control my AYCE urges.  This place is always busy so make reservations if you can but this location is bigger than the others as it has 2 levels plus if you are not having the AYCE, they can sit you in the adjacent restaurant they own too (called Made in China).  Line ups are not as long here except during the busy dining hours so do expect to wait 30-45 minutes to be seated during the busy periods.  That's not very good if you're hungry and they don't have a place for you to sit and the line up is at the door and spills onto the street.  The bibimbap here is kick ass.  Sometimes we choose it over the AYCE when we're not so hungry cos they offer a terrific combo that includes shrimp, beef, chicken and veggies in a large stone pot with an egg and veggies plus hot sauce.  The bad: you gotta like to cook yourself.  You gotta cook BBQ style so don't wear your good clothes but do wear clothes :)  You would want to wash them too cos everything (hair, skin, clothes) are all destined for the wash after you eat here.  Seating is a bit tight as the cooking grills have limitations.  The wait for seating can be long.  Easy to put on weight here.  Too much red meat... keep it to a limit and go for more chicken, etc.    The good: AYCE... All you can eat!!! You have a time limit (though it's rather loosely enforced) but the food just keeps coming.  Chicken, BBQ ribs, pork, beef, fish, squid and a whole ton of veggies (both spicy and not).  Free hot tea is needed to wash down the nitrates (love BBQ's but gotta keep an eye on over consumption).  Great value if you like this kind of experience.  Aside from the long waits (not their fault), everything including the service is pretty good value.  5 stars."}
{"text":"We've been going to the Queen location for years while this location on Yonge and Bloor is closer to my work and for some of my gym mates.  I'm offering up the same review for this location as everything is pretty much the same or consistent and only the decor changes (this has a basement level which is slightly tighter and smokey).  Like the others, this place is always busy so make reservations if you can.  Line ups are long here during the busy dining hours so do expect to wait as much as 1.5 hours to be seated during the busy periods.  That's not very good if you're hungry and they don't have a place for you to sit and the line up is at the door and spills onto the street.  The bibimbap here is kick ass.

{"text":"Came to this location and the one at Yonge and Bloor more than a few times. Nothing special but great for when your in the mood for meat!  I do feel that this Markham location's quality is not as good. Just ate here last week and the meats are sliced much thinner than before. Service is terrible!!! And since the Reno which looks great quality is really lacking now..."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic because you cook it exactly how you like it. Service was a bit slow to take my order but once they had it we got our food within minutes. Servers were constantly refilling our waters which was much needed with all the food we ordered. Tried asking for help with one server but he did a bad job explaining it. Overall would still give 4 stars!"}
{"text":"This place could use some substantial improvement.  The first time I tried to go was over a year ago.  The waiter in front told me to go in the back...and the waiter in the back told me to go to the front.  It is very insulting when you're a single diner and you see through how much they don't want you there, so I left.  I gave this place a second chance today.  The seating was not very good.  I had the misfortune of seeing the waitress clean the Korean BBQ grill with me there and that was not an appetizing sight.  The seating area was also quite pathetic.  Because this place is linked with its next-door neighbour, the Chinese restaurant Made in China (they share staff, so they are probably owned by the same people), Korean Grill House's front seating area is tiny, cramped, and looks very unattractive, which detracts from the dining experience.  I ordered one of the lunch combinations, lamb chops with BBQ chicken, pork and beef.  The order took a little while to get there, but it was acceptable.  The food was a wildly erratic bunch.  The rice was great (fat grains, like in sushi), and the pork chops and chicken chunks were both seasoned perfectly.  The beef was half a step below, but still pretty good.  The problem was with the centerpiece of the dish.  The lamb didn't smell the greatest, and as anybody who's cooked lamb can tell you, there's skill in getting rid of the specific smell of the meat.  And Korean Grill House failed.  The lamb wasn't tender (which is surprising -- lamb is usually tender by nature), and the worst part is that it's very, very greasy.  This evening, a good seven or eight hours after eating the meal, I'm still tasting some residue stale lamb grease in my throat, and that's not a good thing.  I'd say, go to Made in China instead.  Cheaper food, faster service, better surroundings."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place, I am 100 percent satisfied everytime. Just expect long wait times if you go for the night owl special !"}
{"text":"Good restaurant; however they serve up several meats I didn't enjoy too much. The pork and the beef were sliced very thinly to the point that it was coming apart and when you BBQ that, all of the moisture is lost and very little flavor is left. I love the ribs but sometimes there were quite a few pieces that were just fat but besides that, the other meats were pretty satisfying. Grilling all-you-can-eat meat is fun and for the price of $12.99; not too shabby at all. As for the service, it is below average and was VERY slow but I guess I can't blame them as it can be tough during busy hours. It also often takes a while to get refills on food and drinks as I had to ask twice for a refill of rice and water. The side dishes were medicore but I did like the variety of them (bean sprouts, kimchi, radishes, potatoes etc.)"}
{"text":"One of the older Korean style ayce BBQ places in the city. I remember coming here often when ayce BBQ was slim pickings. With so many options now I find it lacking.   They certainly have a good selection of starters and meat to grill, but I find the quality of the meat sub-par. I prefer to go to an a la cart BBQ or another ayce.   Also, when we got the bill they did not bring our change back. We sat there 5 minutes waiting and eventually had to ask for our change. Sure the change could have been an entire tip, but isn't it my choice to leave how much I feel is appropriate?  It was a weekday so it wasn't busy and the waiters did stare at us while we waited for the change so there was no excuse.   They were lucky I felt kind and still left them a tip (15%). I should have left one penny out of spite for them not returning my change."}
{"text":"BEWARE: THIS PLACE CHARGED YOU TIPS ALREADY ON YOUR BILL - @29% ON MY BILL SPECIFICALLY. Food and Service is alright, not the best but better than their Queen Street West location. However, sneaking 29% of tips onto my bills and counting it as tax; then proceed the credit/debit machine to me with the option of adding tips is a little...cringey. I was so glad 3 of us have no physical credit card (they don't take tap) and I have only $90 cash because the bill came up to $89.90. I felt bad I couldn't leave a tip for the server as I was rushed out and did not get to take a closer look at the bill. I did not realized I was being charged 42% tax before tips until I get home and did some math. At the price of $20.99 AYCE on Saturday night for 3 adults with water only, no lamb shrimp or vegetable comes up to $62.97; added 42% tax to come up with $89.41, the closest # I can justify the bill to. At least now I feel good because I did leave a big tips without even knowing it. We went at 9 p.m on Saturday, September 23rd 2017. Could have had a better review if they let me leave tip on my own incentive and acknowledgment."}
{"text":"The food is average at best. What irks me is the service, and the wait staffs lack of respect and basic courtesy for the customers. There are a couple of waiters who are very nice and polite, and nice to chat with too.. but that can't be said for the rest. Most of the servers there are downright rude, and seem to not realise that they are in the service industry."}
{"text":"Fun place! Service is skata! They delay lighting your grill and doge you when you want more! Lol if you do grab your server and if you order more then a normal round they don't like that! (I just want to keep eating with no interruptions.) Oh well, all the store this style are the same. Its a once a year thing for me. Only go if your are not in a rush."}
{"text":"Poorest environment ever****So my boyfriend asked me to hv Korean BBQ..... The food was okay but don't expect to have a very nice environment there. And apperantly the porkbelly came blue****"}
{"text":"I am so embarrassed. I just caused the biggest scene at this place and I want to apologize to all the diners who were trying to enjoy their meals.  But, OH! Korean Grill House! What happened to you? Who hurt you so badly that you turn around and treat your loyal customers like thieves?!   My family and I have been frequent visitors to your numerous establishments over the last 20 years. We have cooked and feasted and suffered your meat sweats more times than I care to admit!   Today was not our first time at the rodeo. We know how much food we can handle in one sitting.  We are not in the business of wasting food.  The meal started out just like every other time. All you can eat. easy. First round of food went down the hatch and we ordered our second (and final) round. The side dishes came right quick but the meat was nowhere in sight. We waited...and waited...and waited some more. We asked 3 separate servers to check on our meat and still nothing.   Almost 30 mins later the meat arrived. By now our 4 year old was antsy and we needed to get him home for bed. Someone came by to apologize and offered a free ice cream for the child. \"Thanks, but no need for that\", was my reply. There will be no time for dessert tonight.  We ate as much and as quick as we could but soon realized that it was now far past 4 yo's bedtime and we could not force feed ourselves to finish dinner. So, we asked for the bill and to have the cooked meat packed in a box.  ....you see where this is going....  A server with the tidy tile of \"supervisor\" came to advise us that it is not their policy to allow customers to take away cooked meat. Counterpoint: \"is it your policy to leave a 30 minute window between the 1st and 2nd  orders of 'all you can eat?' \"   He apologized for the delay but was of the mind that we were talking about 2 different things: 1) the restaurant epically delaying our meal, which they already apologized for; and 2) customers/thieves wanting to take food that they could not finish, home.  I was of the mind that their delay was the direct cause of us having to take food home with us. So, rather than have them throw perfectly good food in the garbage, please let us just finish our dinner at home. I'm not trying to steal your food, dude.   We spent another 15 minutes arguing back and forth with me yelling(!) at this point. This man just wanted to be right, hiding behind the policy instead of thinking about customer service and the comfort of all the other guests in the restaurant who were clearly disturbed by the ruckus. I was, admittedly, being stubborn as well.  He said to me, \"we can give you ANYTHING else you want, except for taking the food home.\" uh, ok. \"Comp the bill?\" nope. \"comp the wine?\" nope. \"so what can I ask for that you will say yes to?\" his answer: \"It's up to you.\" wtf??  Finally one of his coworkers came by and had to physically push him away from my table. In the end the new guy agreed to pack up our food \"on exception\" and I paid my bill in full.  So, dear reader (if you have made it this far), I am breaking up with KGH today. Whatever baggage they carry that damaged their common sense will never be my burden to deal with again. We will not ever return to any of their locations."}
{"text":"My experience was great here, I got here right when it opened at 11:30 didn't expect so much to people to come so quick I thought me and my friends were going to be alone then suddenly people were lining up so quick. The service is so fast and the staff was so nice they sat us down within 5 minutes. The food was bomb me and my friends got all you can eat lunch special which was really cheap like $13.99 for all three meats: pork, beef, chicken then sides like kimchee, rice stuff like that we got so full we had to force it down but right when I left I wanted seconds"}
{"text":"Came here at 11pm with girlfriend was asked to do last call at 11:15, made last call order with 6 beef,3 chickens. Only 2 beef and one chicken arrive asked the waiter for the rest as it was last call and we were not anywhere near full he tells us if we finish our food before 12 we can ask for more meat. Sure sounds cool but when we finished eating all our food at 11:40 we ask for more food and they tell us no more after last call. Wtf? Serious so I try to bargain I ask for only 2 beef as it cooks fast and I understand they have to close nope instead he wants us to pay the bill. Ate no where near my moneys worth and he had the audacity to put tips into the machine already when I tried to pay with credit. Will not come back again."}
{"text":"I have always been the type that picks quantity over quality.  But as i age, i have started to notice that i don't eat as much anymore and would rather focus more on taste than consumption.   This place used to be my go to place for beef.  Our table would easily have 25 stacks of those plates in which they use to bring the raw beef out.  After tonight, i think i counted 5 in total.  The quality seems to have taken a dip as well.  Chicken, pork, sausages and fish were... let's say, not the greatest.    Dinner for 3 including 3 drinks came out to $67 with tax and tip.  I would rather go to ayce jap buffet in the future.    On the positive side, i walked out rather than being rolled out.  Lol  Will i come back... probably not.  But the night time buffet caught my attention.  Hard to go wrong for $10.99 ayce beef.  Lol"}
{"text":"All you can eat Korean BBQ is there anything else I have to say. This place is like other KBBQ places. The one good thing is its in the core of downtown Toronto and is open late. For $20 I can eat all the beef ribs I want and that is great. It may not be the healthiest food but it's cheap and filling."}
{"text":"Came with a friend on a busy Sat night and we were seated right away. The meat were all well seasoned and came out faster than I expected. Some of the pork had more fat than I wanted but once grilled, everything tasted great. I did not like the beef liver though Not a bad deal for AYCE, you probably pay the same for 2 or 3 meat dishes at another restaurant. I liked the grilling experience Staff were nice and my water was constantly refilled"}
{"text":"I'm sure most of you will know that this is not actually Korean BBQ. But as there is Korean style Chinese food (Jjajangmyeon and Jjamppong), I can accept Chinese style Korean food.  I've visited several different locations under this franchise, and I'm pretty confident that all of the food is the same. They must use the same recipes for the sauces. The thing I find weird about this franchise is that everything tastes the same. Even the kimchi and the bean sprouts all taste like BBQ. It's weird.  Unlike, say AYCE sushi, KBBQ is very generous with its \"all you can eat,\" moniker. In several of my visits, the plates get replenished readily, and often, staff walk around with trays full of plates of raw meat, asking if you want more refills.  Eventually, I stop eating because I get tired of eating the same flavour, and not because I'm actually full...maybe they do that on purpose!  I can't deny that it's a fun time with a group of friends.  Some tips: Ask for a new grill when your food starts to all taste like burnt stuff When cooking fish, place it on top of a piece of beef so that it doesn't stick to the grill."}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Pretty good food, no complaints. Ribs and beef were great.  Large restaurant. Good price."}
{"text":"I like the social aspect of this restaurant, being able to bbq at your table, and the meat is of sufficent quality to rate it good. The side veggies are a bit \"ok\" low quality with a lot of chili all over it, but for the price one can't complain. Overall, I quite like going to the restaurant for a change and recommend it!"}
{"text":"I love eating here, I find much enjoyment cooking my own food in this mini grill !  The foods good, just very salty. Service is good and has a good atmosphere. You do have to however have an acquired taste for this restaurant. I would not suggest going if you hate seeing raw meats or aren't much of a cultural food person. Even though its not authentic Korean bbq its still good. As I would like to mention a lot of Korean bbq restaurants/ sushi restaurants are HongKong based so they kind of make their own little menu inspired by Korean/Japanese culture, food, etc."}
{"text":"This place is great for a long lunch with colleagues if you are in the area. It is cheap no frills AYCE Korean BBQ buffet. They come around and refill your drinks regularly as well. For the price it can't be beat. I found the meat very salty though . My meal was heavy on the red meat. The chicken wasn't the greatest, but it was fine."}
{"text":"Tasty food, a little salty. But otherwise very nice experience. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Been here more times than I can count. The key here is the 'night owl' special. AYCE for $10 after 10pm! The meat is thinly sliced but isn't really marinated. Lots of sides as is usual in this space.   The service isn't great and the meat is nothing to write home about. But for the price, you can't argue with what you get."}
{"text":"I went with a friend and we had a blast cooking on the grill.  I love k dramas, running man so I always wanted to try kbbq. I'm sure it's better in korea but hey this place is close by and it's funner then just waiting for 60 + minutes for your food to be cooked at a normal restaurant. You can chat with friends while cooking and eating  (since this stuff cooks really quick!) . The waiter served us the meat within like 5 mins.  AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"This is a good place. Unlimited meat grill. Cheaper cuts of meat, but they aren't complaining if you don't eat or grill the fattier pieces. The side dishes are fantastic. The bean sprouts are the best. Huge wait for dinner on a weekend. So big in fact it isn't worth it. But late night dinner (after 10pm) has a reduced price, so check that out!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. I ordered a meal and changed my idea 1 min after and they wouldn't allow the kitchen to change, which is entirely possible to do. And this is on my one year anniversary. They ask me to order another meal on top of my wrongly-ordered meal. Absolutely hate this place with cold waiters"}
{"text":"i usually go to their Yonge street location which is excellent, although i've never been offered the ribs at Yonge.   I went on new years eve for an early dinner with an old friend. It was busy but they still found a table for myself and a friend. We ordered the usual (6 of everything). I still wish there was more rice in an order, since everything you order is a stack of meat. they dont give you alot of starch or carbs to process the meat. however, the meat was great and i still love the concept of cookin my own food at my table (even if they are small slices of meat that even the most illiterate foodie could cook).   one thing i wish that ALL the korean grill houses had was BIGGER WATER GLASSES. Now that I'm thinking about it its actually very frustrating. If you're going to chop meat into small slices and cure them with salt to keep them fresh (anybody with half a brain knows that when u cut a piece of meat into thin slices like korean grill house does, it dries out quicker and adding salt to it makes it last longer so you can sell it to the masses before it expires) you can at least let us have large water glasses to stay hydrated instead of making the poor kids working the floor fill up our water glasses every 30 seconds. I actually felt bad about how many water refills i needed and judging from the variety of servers/bussers filling it, i doubt my 10$ tip would net any of them one dollar.    Other than that though, it was a good time as always."}
{"text":"Nice variety of meat but all the meat tastes like its been marinated in the same sauce. Definitely not an authentic Korean Restaurant. More like Americanized Korean Restaurant..which is ran by Chinese people. having to pay extra for kimchi tells it all lol"}
{"text":"As someone else noted this is not a Korean grill. There is no gochujang or any of the other spices for dipping and the kimchi is watery. The grill also gets dirty after awhile so you taste it and not the meat.  However if you just want to put fire to meat and gorge this place is a good choice. I went with the basic and for 13.something(including tax) I ate my fill.  I'm pretty disappointed with Toronto's Korean grill options and am still searching for a good one."}
{"text":"WARNING: This is NOT korean food. This place should be called China Grill House. Giveaways are that they give deep fried tofu, serve bubble tea, and appetizers like spring rolls or fried prawns. The bbq meats like the chinese style \"bulgogi\" wasn't bad but dont expect good quality meat. Not the most cleanest place. The server would touch raw meat then start touching the cash register and other stuff. Overall very disappointed since I was hoping to get korean food and got fooled by the name..."}
{"text":"On a day where it was -20 degree Celsius it was just a relief to enter this establishment.  I've been to many Korean BBQ restaurants in Chicago and the difference is they use charcoal briquets and the smell hits you when you enter, and leaves on your clothes.  The Korean Grill House uses natural gas and it still does an excellent job of charring this wonderful marinated meat.  I would highly reccomend going for the kailbi short ribs.  The only reason this place did the not get 5 stars was, because they leave the kailbi off the all you can eat menu and replace it with inferior meats.  The staff was very attentitive, as I can not say the same for the Yonge St. location."}
{"text":"I worked here for a short period of time in 2015. Let me just tell you that this restaurant recycles its meat. For those who go to eat Korean BBQ beware! THE MEAT SERVED ARE LEFTOVERS FROM OTHER CUSTOMERS! As a matter of fact, when I worked there I was yelled at for throwing the leftovers in the garbage instead of keeping them for other customers to eat. The procedure was to take the leftover meats and pile them into shelf in the back, then put them into new plates and continue serving.   As well, this guy named Leo who works here is very very rude. He is a supervisor but sets a terrible model for other employees. If he is your server I feel sorry for you.  Please also be aware that not only is the place unsanitary, the tips that you leave will not be distributed to your respective waiters and waitresses. They will be distributed according to seniority, with most of the amount taken away by the manager and supervisors. Let's just hope that they use it to purchase more sanitary kitchen equipment.  As a side note, I quit my waitressing job here because I was disgusted at the unsanitary practices (such as recycling leftovers) as well as the lack of respect between coworkers."}
{"text":"Stopped for a late lunch with my daughter while Christmas shopping. Ordered some beef and pork for the bbq. It came with rice and sides of kimchi, noodles, tofu and pickled radish. It was very good and the experience cooking our own meat on the table top grill was fun and memorable. My 13 year old loved it."}
{"text":"Update: I have since returned to this restaurant and I would say it has redeemed itself. I do find the food to be a little over salted & not the highest quality cuts, but the overall experience was quite enjoyable this time."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Service was satisfactory.  Restaurant was clean but the washroom was disgusting.  I unfortunately discovered it at the end of my meal."}
{"text":"We come here every 2 wks as it is one of our fave restaurant. Though our experience today was a bit dissapointing for my son and my husband as they were ordering drinks and they're being ignored. They've probably asked almost all of the servers and it came almost at the last min.  The alley is a bit narrow and I was trying my best to avoid body contact by any means to anyone but the lady that was going in is so careless as she bumped my bum. By reading all the reviewers and some said that it is not Korean authentic restaurant that it is being run by non Korean, all I can say is NO WONDER. I have to ask my Korean coworkers about real Korean and Japanese restaurant around GTA. And convince my family to look for an authentic korean restaurant."}
{"text":"I went there last weekend and had a pretty good meal. The meat tasted kinda same, since the sauces in beef, pork, beef ribs were similar, but they were still good. The service was nice, the waiter asked if I want more food and drinks very often. And the price was accetpable, especially comparing to other places at downtown area. I will go back again in the future!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick and easy meal after skating with the kids. We arrived just before 10pm and the 7 of us were seated right away upstairs. The night owl was great value, food was tasty and service was pretty good."}
{"text":"This location is alright. Still prefer the queen location over this one. But if you're in the area, it will suffice. The only thing is when it's the all you can eat happy hour, you'll find a lot of half drunk college kids. Plus the seating can get very awkward if you're only a party of two. Sometimes, they'll have you share really close space beside a loud chewer or slurper."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????? ?????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????  ?????????????????  ??????11???????????????12?????????????  ??????????"}
{"text":"Very nice place since the new reno. The lunch box special cant be beat for the price. I havnt done the grill for a while but from what i remember it was always good. Service has gotten much better lately. Still one of my all time favorites."}
{"text":"This is NOT Korean bbq. I got the $12.99 all you can eat night owl option on Friday night and ordered only the beef. The beef was seasoned very poorly, unlike the rich flavors one would expect from proper Korean bbq. As a Korean and a frequent consumer of Korean bbq, I fear that some people who may have never tried Korean bbq before would think this is actually proper Korean bbq.  The side dishes were either too salty, too oily, or not flavorful at all. Turns out the owner, staff, and chef are all not Korean, according to the waiter that served us. This would not be an issue if the food even marginally reminded one of Korean cuisine as the restaurant's name implies, but none of the food served to us did except the rice. If you are expecting Korean cuisine at KOREAN Grill House, you're in for an unpleasant surprise. Service was sub par. I would never go here again."}
{"text":"It was fun, except I ate a lot of char!  If you are looking for a different, interactive experience, that involves cooking your own food, this is a good place to do it.    Service was ok, lots of servers were bringing food and cleaning up dishes.  I wish the waiter explained better how to use the grill and how to eat the food.  Apparently, the way to do it is to wrap the meet you cook in the salad leaves with other vegetables and then dip that wrap in the sauce!  Also, in the end we noticed that people next to us first cooked all their food, and then ate it with rice.  That seemed to be the smart way to do it.  We ended up cooking and eating at the same time, everything was burning, at times the flame was out of control, I was worried about my eye brows!    I can't comment on the quality of meats and fish, because everything ended up burned and charred and tasted the same.  We were concerned about raw/cooked food cross contamination, but it was ok.  It's a good value if you are looking to eat a lot of meat.  I would go back to that place, maybe in about a year the soonest."}
{"text":"Been here several times. Love the night owl special which starts after 10pm. Normally they are pretty good with their hours but that changed last night. Called them during the day to find out as to when will they be closing on a Sunday of a long weekend and was informed that closing time will be 2am. Went for a movie and then drove straight to this location. Was in front of the restaurant at 12:30am only to realize that they have closed the restaurant for today, even though the hours posted on the main door states that the usual closing time for Sunday is 1am. So if you decide to pay visit to this place after 10pm I would probably call them a couple of times to verify the store hours."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends to celebrate my birthday. Called in around 2:00 pm for a reservation for 7:30 pm and they were able to accommodate which was very nice of them.  I got there at 7:30 pm. Unfortunately, since it is in a plaza, parking was limited. I had to park all the way at the back and around the corner. The table was reserved so we were able to sit down immediately. As my friends slowly trickled into the restaurant, we quickly placed our orders by marking a piece of paper. We obviously did the All-You-Can-Eat. It was about $16.00.  Let's just say we had enough meat to last us for DAYS! The only downfall of this location is that a table of 6 only has 1 grill which meant that only 2 or 3 people could do their cooking at once. However, if you go with amazing people...they will feed you :)   The service there was good. Our food came out in a timely manner and refills on our drinks were...a bit muddled at times. The supervisor, Alex, was great though. He made sure that our table was well stocked of food and drinks. He even got another server to come by to change our grill a few times throughout the night.   Overall, we had a great time! Definitely would come back for another round of a meat-filled meal with awesome company!"}
{"text":"A regular stop for us after dancing next door. Spicy salmon bibimbap fills us up. Aaron always looks after!"}
{"text":"This was the second  time at this location and let's just say, they never fail to impress. The service was great and the food was better. I mean, who can hate an all you can eat??  It's definitely a place to go with a bunch of friends!  I'm a really big fan of their  salmon and ribs!  As well as their Hong Kong style lemon tea! My best friend is very picky with trying new stuff but not with the lemon tea, one sip and she was in love! Our meal costed $25!  One thing I wish they did was leave more of the ordering snip bits on the table,so we dont have to ask. Also going to the washroom and coming out to see a guy at the sink is really awkward... but that just me  All in all I loved it and would totally go here again!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible i once went here and found metal object in the food like a bolt, the food is not authentic and it poor quality. The guy made me pay for the meal and gave me the wrong change"}
{"text":"Have AYCE dinner here for 15.99/person. Cheap comparing to others. And i notice that the lunch and night owl(after 10pm) is only for 9.99. It was a pretty good experience. The service was good and fast. The store was full of people but still have seats. So i do not need to wait. You can add 6 or 7 to add vegetable to ur choice add 2 dollars to 17.99 to get ox touge, lamp..etc The choice of food was quite limited with only the basic one(beef, pork, chicken...etc) Try their taro milk tea, not bad for a korean restaurant. The side dishes looks different from other korean places. Overall my experience there was good and I would go there again."}
{"text":"We went with our party of six and we were all very disappointed. The main flavour is burnt and it gets progressively worse as the meal proceeds since charcoal sticks to the food. It is also very unsanitary and my husband felt very ill later on. The same utensil to handle raw food and cooked food is used. If you want the taste of charcoal and enjoy a good colon cleansing then this is the place for you!!!"}
{"text":"It's not bad for the price that you pay (night owl price $10.99). It's pretty packed and the waiters are always busy but they do try their best. Other than the chicken, the meats are thinly sliced. I don't mind it as much as others because the meat will cook faster. Not a bad late night option if you're hungry."}
{"text":"I went there with a couple friends and would have to say: 5 stars for service. We took up six seats and were waiting on people throughout the night, but they let us have the space, were super on top of refilling our water and asking us if we wanted anything else. The fact that we were an indecisive, slow-eating group and ended up catching up over a period of 2 and a 1/2 hours, which the staff respected and didn't try to hasten us out the door was pretty awesome considering I would've kicked our loud butts out myself!  The food is pretty good - I ordered the chicken fried noodles which were decent--just needed a bit more spice. I've come here one other time and would definitely recommend ordering the all you can eat and cooking your own raw meat/seafood for experience's sake. Portions are plenty!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever, i used to come here alot, the service is terrible, the waiters dont care about you and try to ignore or pretend they didnt see or hear me when you call them over.  They include a service charge in their bills to include the tips because probably no one wants to tip them because of their terrible service I went there with a few friends and we got sick after eating late night, one of my friends puked"}
{"text":"I love this place! Been here many times. Why? Inexpensive, food taste good, and you'd get super full. Basically if you're super hungry, this is the place to go. If you're out on a date and wanna impress your lady with your cooking/grilling skills, this is the place to go. Plus, if she's never been to a Korean bbq restaurant before, she'll be amazed that there's fire in the table. (just don't plan to go anywhere afterwards, because your/her clothes is gonna smell like bbq smoke). Unless she's a vegetarian, then you can't really bring her here.  Food: I usually get the beef, pork, chicken, and SHORT RIBS! Their short ribs are the bomb; very tender. Their chicken is ok, I think they marinate the chicken in some sort of curry seasoning. I like curry, but their seasoning is not the greatest. Depending on my mood, I'd sometimes order the squid and salmon too. Their other fish breaks easily, so skip that..  Service: meh to OK. Bathroom: Don't go to their bathroom unless you really have to go. You've been warned....They're disgusting, which is weird, because it's not that hard to keep a clean bathroom."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was ok?maybe there were so people need to be served at one moment I could understand that. The only one i can not take is that beef slices was too salty. I like bbq there."}
{"text":"Great value with $10 all-you-can eat korean bbq lunch. Haven't ordered anything else on the menu, so the AYCE gets three stars as a stand-alone."}
{"text":"I was here on a Monday night and it was too busy. They gave us a table but you won't get good customer service every waiter is on the run. I asked for water 4 times and they would forget. Finally I told them to bring a pitcher  of water so we won't bother them. Cause they honestly looked like we were bothering them. They brought the pitcher of water but with a little fuss. Lol  It was an enjoyable experience to cook your own meats in open fire. The meats were all brought to us in small plastic trays. Metals prongs we used to cook our meats."}
{"text":"Poor attempt at Korean BBQ!!!  Maybe it's not fair to compare this to any bbq places I'd visited in S. Korea, but it was so far off, it was so bad.  The Marinade used on the meat tasted more Chinese than Korean, and the same marinade was used on all of the different kinds of meat.  No panchan, lettuce, sesame oil salt, raw garlic, daenjang, etc. Kimchi and rice extra? I've been to bbq places where they don't serve rice (Korean food are extremely balanced) but always some fresh lettuce to wrap the meat and kimchi! That was the dead giveaway. Then we saw the cut, tasted the meat, and it was Game Over."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service and will return. My only complaint was the washroom was in need of a cleaning."}
{"text":"The Korean Grill house is hands down my favorite place to eat in the city. There are two locations in Toronto. This one has a more modern and clean feel to it, so if you are going for the first time check the Bloor location out first.  THE thing to get here is the All-You-Can-Eat speical. Like a buffet you get a cheaper price at lunch but they also have a late night owl special where from 10pm to 2am you can get it for the lunch price.  I usually stick to Pork, Beef and Chicken as the fish tends to flake and cook too quick when you try to pick it up. I personally haven't tried the Ox tongue or liver so someone else will have to let me know how that goes.  The draw to this place has to be the price for what you get. Unlimited meat or $13 bucks (coke refills are free too!).    Any time I have a friend who visits me not from TO we always end up going to the Grill House and they all end up loving it.   At first cooking your own meat might seem a little daunting but once you get used to it, it's pretty amazing. I recommend if you try it for the first time avoid Friday night and Sat night as the line up is out the door. The service is best when it's an off night. Enjoy the meat coma!  Tip: When you start eating your first round of cooked meat throw some more on so when you are done eating, the next around is ready to go!"}
{"text":"Had to eat here again! $ 16 all you can eat Korean bbq?  Gotta do it!  So good =)"}
{"text":"This is the best place for Korean grilled food - EVER! My husband and I would come here at least twice a month for their all you can eat grill buffet. And let me tell you, when they say \"all you can eat\" they really mean it! The initial serving of meat, chicken, or sea food is small but a perfect starter when you know it's a bottomless plate. I brought my entire family here once for a reunion and 4 years later they cannot stop raving about it!  Highly recommended if you want to eat til you drop (or have to roll out the door)."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is definitely the service. Food came out quick and there was always someone around to tend our needs or take our orders.  However the food itself was not the greatest.  I found most of the meats to be marinated too salty. The sides were pretty disappointing too.  The worst part was the rice that came hard and stale.  The redeeming factor is that it's pretty cheap so at least you will get your money's worth!"}
{"text":"all my philosophy teachers of existentialism, empiricism, and rationalism say, ' mm mmm mmmmm......,  as far as a dish of Bibimbap  goes. ' Find out.   tp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibimbap"}
{"text":"Loved the price and it was a favourite stop for me and a friend to go to! Loved the unlimited sides and it was really good."}
{"text":"Compared to other all you can eat Korean grills, this is one of my favorite. It's cheap, fairly fast and delicious. Sadly I have had issues with cleanliness a few times so my rating is only 3 out of 5. The staff are helpful though, be it bringing clean glasses when I feel it is dirty, to adjusting the grill, they rock."}
{"text":"The grill burners are WAY TOO LOW and people ended up standing up while grilling because it's EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to see what you're grilling!!! Instead of having a relaxing meal experience, it's going to be and will be a stressful one. We didn't enjoy at all, unless you're 6 feet tall or higher."}
{"text":"Decent AYCE KBBQ for the price i suppose. We were upstairs in the group area and the ambiance was mediocre. It is an old maintained building, but it looked and felt like it. Maybe that doesn't matter so much when you're busy cooking, eating, and chatting with friends. The washroom upstairs is small and solo, but clean. Surprised there wasn't a line up for it.  Interesting grill set up, which took some getting used to as the grill is lowered into the table to allow for an integrated fan to suck out the smoke. This meant you would need to stand up to maximize grill area. Another difference was the wider spacing of the slots in the grill. Usually there are more, but smaller slots. It didn't matter as much as i thought it would. Ordering is through a little square slip of paper upon which you enter the number of items from the menu options.  The little appetizers kimchi and potatoes seemed to be getting on the stale side from the way they looked. Disappointing was the over-watered rice. Beef was at times on the fatty side. I liked how they marinated the chicken with some sort of light spices.  Service was fine and an over all decent experience. Keep in mind standard group gratuity applied to the bill is 13%."}
{"text":"We walked by this resto the night before and thought it would be a great experience. And it was - we had squid, pork, beef, salmon that we bbq'd in the hole.  The decor is bright white - clean and slick. Overall it was worth every penny.  Would definitely do it again."}
{"text":"The food quality is always hot and cold at this location. Sometimes its great, sometimes not so much, I wish they could be a little more consistent with the way they marinate their meats. Also, another issue I have with the location is the staff. No matter when we go, for some reason we always tend to have bad service. At first we thought it was because they were busy, but when we started to look around and observe what was going on, my bf and I realize that the servers at this location cater to their Asian customers before anyone else... Which came as a big surprise, shouldn't people be served in order that they arrive? Until they can learn to serve people equally, I will be ditching this chain completely."}
{"text":"Never call it Korean BBQ! I expected authentic Korean BBQ and it was awful. Meats were too salty and too much seasoned. Kimchi seafood soup was also flavorless.  Took more than 10 mins to change the grill. Waste of money.."}
{"text":"Update: They no longer have ox tongue. I am gutted and will probably not come back.  Food Quality & Price: Good price for AYCE.  Meats have good marinades (though it's definitely up to personal taste).  I love the ox tongue and ribs.  Chicken seems to garner a love it or hate it reaction. I LOVE the beef soup but it is loaded with MSG, so just be aware of that.  At the end, it cost about $20 a head without drinks.   Facility: They have completely renovated this location.  Decor has been updated and the ambiance is generally warmer and more professional.  The waitstaff wear uniform t-shirts (and Santa hats during the holidays).  In addition, there are new chairs and banquettes.  Washrooms have also been updated and look generally cleaner than the gross looking things the had before.  HOWEVER, my girlfriend went into the new washroom but was still greeted by a giant turd in one of the toilets.  Despite being nicely renovated, the staff need to designate or have a washroom check-in every hour or so.   Service: Service is always a hit or miss at this location.  Having come here with my husband for the past 6 years, the place has improved and service has improved SLIGHTLY. If you go on a weeknight, service is attentive and great.  I came back days later on a weekend night (Saturday) and the servers barely pay attention to what you're saying.  On a busy night, they will do the bare minimum.  Table of four asks for napkins?  They bring you two. You need to ask repeatedly and remind them of things or you will be left waiting.  If you really enjoy the food or the experience, go on a weekday.  Overall: Having been a patron for about 6 years, I enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant.  The food is good and at a decent price.  Service definitely needs work and so do restaurant maintenance.  I don't doubt that I may return whenever I am craving KBBQ, but there is definitely room for improvement if this establishment wants to maximize profit."}
{"text":"Do not go to this place, seats were awkward and uncomfortable, my friend got a coke and I got water, so as it was time to pay the bill and tip the waiter, my drink was empty and there was only one server at the time to wait the entire first floor, I was really thirsty and drank out of my friends drink, and he came up to me and said you cannot do that, after we had tipped him. I was annoyed and service obviously was horrible. You're better off going to the Kbbq grillhouse in Richmond hill where service is much better and at the end of the day, don't care if you took a little sip from a different drink after you leave."}
{"text":"I don't usually leave bad reviews and I'm a big fan of Korean food but I hate everything about this place! I don't get the hype about this chain of 'Korean' restaurants that are actually run by Chinese! None of the dishes are worth raving about- and whenever I went there the servers were always rude and in a hurry. Avoid."}
{"text":"Came here for the late night special on a Tuesday Night (11.99 after 10 p.m.) with my boyfriend and our friend. Service is not fast nor slow. It is good enough, though. The chicken and pork marinade are my favourite. Great deal and meal at the late night cost!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.  Terrible experience. Never got even half of what i ordered and muthafkin Jimmy spilled meat juice on my hands, shirt, pants, and winter jacket. No apology of any sort or compensation. Also food was only meh. 2/5 for the food. 0/5 for overall experience."}
{"text":"First to start off, I got myself a Yelp account just to leave my opinion on this place.   I've been coming to this location for almost 20 years and have always love it. The food WAS great, and the staff were friendly.   Lately, within the last 3 months, their food has been overly salty. First,  their signature sweet soy sauce (the ones they have in the bottles on the tables) went from great to concentrated salt water. No sweetness left...  Then their meat marinate started to get salty as well. I told one of the owners about it and they said they were aware and was gonna to fix it soon.   Ok... Nothing improved for 2 months.   Today,  my parents wanted to go their for lunch.  I ordered my usual. BBQ beef lunch box. SALTY,  EVERYTHING.    SALTY BEEF, SALTY TOFU, SALTY RADISH, SALTY BEAN SPROUTS,  even the rice was SALTY. Everything tasted like a salt lick!  Yuck!   I'm not returning to any of their locations till they get better cooks with proper tongues, or get rid of 3/4 of their salt use.   Good bye Korean Grill House, so disappointed..."}
{"text":"A great place to try at least once in your life. The aesthetics and experience are great, but I don't see it becoming a regular place for eating out. The all you can eat price is great as for $20 you can't go wrong. However, the food is mediocre at best and the service did not meet my expectations. A few times the waiter couldn't even describe which meat we were eating. I did enjoy the fact that my group and I could cook our own food as it was a great time for all of us. Nearing the end of our meal, it seemed as though our host had given up on us and decided it was time for us to leave because we didn't receive the same service we received when we first arrived. What the biggest turn off for me was when we got our bill. An automatic 15% service charge was placed on our bill. I understand that that is the expected tip at a restaurant, but our waiter was not really a waiter. He brought us food once in a while but couldn't even answer questions about our meal. I can't justify tipping 15% for someone who didn't really help us out. Overall, I did enjoy the experience of a Korean Grill for my first time, but I wouldn't make it a regular outing for myself."}
{"text":"Meats- Alright, more or less the same as every other KBBQ place in this price range Seafood- Average, I sea food. Drinks- Bottomless plum drink is a nice addition to have Side dishes- Good.  Very average"}
{"text":"Among all my reviews, my best and deepest compliment to the waiter in the downstair level of this Korean Grill House. I gave him extra-gratuity for his effort. Beyond expectation performance. The guy walked and walked, and constantly working. Don't remember his name, but I went back to dine last month, he was still there, skinny Asian guy. Food of Korean Grill House is always standard, but this waiter attracted me back to dine in this location."}
{"text":"The service was great but I did not enjoy the food that was provided.  First, instead of feeling I am going to a Korean BBQ place, I felt like the meat was more hot pot type meat but marinate in Korean sauces.  Instead of the real typical Korean BBQ meat like pork belly, spare ribs, or beef brisket I got a bunch of meat that are not meant for grilling.  I would say the service was great but I would not call it Korean BBQ with the right kind of meat."}
{"text":"You won't miss this restaurant as you walk along Queen Street from University westbound.  Within the area, you can smell the BBQ.  So be prepared to dress appropriately so that you won't leave the place with the BBQ smell on your body the whole night.  This is AYCE Korean BBQ.  There is the base AYCE for $15.95.  If you want lamb and shrimp then pay $2-3 more.  The basic covers lots of meat but if you want any vege, then another $3 more.  We like the AYCE Kim chi as starter.  Here come the many square dishes of meat that you can pile them up.  There are beef slice, ribs, liver, chicken, salmon, sausage, pork and so on.  The meat is marinated to be on the salty side.  So you have to drink a lot while BBQ.    The service is quick at the beginning.  There is a long line up right after the baseball game.  The waitresses are fast enough to remove the trays once they are empty.  At the end, I can see my empty trays keep piling up at the edge of the table without anyone taking them away.  But what do you expect for an ACYE restaurant.  For the price, it is a good deal."}
{"text":"First time trying Korean BBQ - great experience! I may have cheated since I went with a friend who goes to Korean BBQ all the time and pretty much grilled everything for me.  Grilling your own food was pretty neat - I enjoyed the beef and chicken, however, I found the more I ate, the more everything just tasted the same to me.   AYCE dinner for $16 is cheap, as well as their $4.50 beers. Would definitely recommend this place to others and would like to come back for more, maybe try to impress someone else by trying the grill. :)  Cheers!   - T"}
{"text":"Their food was fresh and tasted well marinate. However, their sanitariness is questionable. The soy sauce container used a rubber band to keep the cap in place rather than have it replaced.  Their glasses are not the cleanest either, so I had to gulp with hesitation.   Yes, though I complaint about all those here I know I would go back because their food is good."}
{"text":"Been to a few of the locations over the years, the one on Yonge St downtown, the converted one in Markham and just recently this Queen St one.    What's nice about the Queen St location it has a nice bright gray interior.  Sound contradictory but it's true.   Service was good. We were able to find servers nearby for any additional requests.  The meats were good too, there's a decent variety to select from. Beef, pork, chicken, beef short ribs, salmon.   Only bad item we tried that night was the salmon, it wasn't fresh. I don't know why I ordered it as it's practically a cardinal rule of mine not to order any seafood from KBBQ. For one it messes up the grill , 2 leaves a big stink in the air. If you do order seafood word to the wise order it last.   Pluses -   - you can have BBQ in the middle of the winter. yeeah!  - if you're bulking up.. back-up the truck. protein a plenty here. :)  - impress your girl with your manly BBQ skills. Rarr.  ;) haha"}
{"text":"The concept is all you can eat BBQ. Order up your meats and vegetables and you cook them on the round circular grill .   There's a veggies option for $3 more. It includes lettuce, pineapple, onions, green pepper, mushroom, roasted garlic. We tried this tonight, it was pretty good, and  breaks up the monotony of a pure meatfest. Lettuce wrapped beef = yum!   It's fricken cold in here. It is sparsely decorated, a majority of the seating is at the second level.   The service was terrible tonight. We found ourselves having to ask at least twice for anything and if he had forgotten we didn't bother asking again.   I'd say only worth it to go late night  (after 10pm) or during lunch when it's $8.99. I would also strongly advise to not sit downstairs. It cold and the kitchen is upstairs to begin with.   Oh yeah the food, this time leaving the worse til last. Massively salty."}
{"text":"First time at a Korean BBQ place, and I was not disappointed. The selection of grill items is really good, and the cost of the meal is very reasonable as well"}
{"text":"The service here is alright, but you really should only come here if your hungry and only want to spend $10-15 dollars.   Food comes quick as with most AYCE Korean BBQ places, and they're quick to bring you more. Not bad if your craving it and only want to spend a few bucks."}
{"text":"Reserved in advance, walked in, looked pretty busy, waited a minute for someone to seat us, sat down, ordered ayce, asked for some water, food came with side dishes, still waited for water, asked for water again, more food came, food was good, still no water, ordered second round, water finally came, fire died out, ordered third round and asked for fire to be fixed, ordered some soup, grill started getting dirty, fire died out again, waited for soup, soup didn't come, changed out the grill, ordered more soup, soup came, soup was good, so we asked for more, waiter rolled her eyes, food starts tasting like carcinogens, got two more soups, asked for bill, waited some time, asked for bill again, bill came, service charge 12%  TL;DR food was good, but service was disappointing"}
{"text":"Great lunch price of $11 after tax and tip!   Now onto the food, had the ayce normal menu so the squid, White fish fillet, shaved pork, shaved beef, and spicy chicken. Side dishes included fried tofu (spicy), kimchi, spicy and normal bean sprout, pickled radish, beef soup and rice. considering it is a lunch menu offering this isn't too bad and earns 3 stars.  Where they shined was on service, now this might have been an odd staff member who took pride in great service, but I found that they were very attentive, and kept our table well stocked with the side dishes that we were pounding through and the meat which we were dumping into the grill. We had to change the grill once and that was quick and courteous.  Note: they offer an AYCE veggie+pineapple addition that you can get, but it is 3 dollars and if you are going strictly for the cost-food ratio it isn't recommended.   I would definitely return, however considering how hard ayce is on the healthy living aspect of my life, it is unfortunately an once in a while splurge.   3 stars for the food + price, 1 star for the service"}
{"text":"Korean Grill House is a good place for meat.  Meat meat meat, lotsa meat. Meat is how I live, meat is how I roll, and this place is full. of. Meat.  This location of Korean Grill house is in a small plaza off midland Ave, so it's fairly hard to park, which is a small downside. the inside of the restaurant houses a lot of people, and it's always packed, so you have to wait to get a seat.  You have either the choice of an all-you-can-eat grill, or a lunch bento box (at lunch). Being a regular customer after church, I come here (it's in the area) and usually get the bento box, as I'm starving after service. It's a fairly stable meal choice, with the choices of several kinds of meat at about 8-12 dollars each, with rice, tofu, a bunch of Asian veggies, and of course MEATTTT MEATMEATMEATMEATTTTTTTTT!!!!! sorry.  I find the beef is either very very very  good or satisfactory, and is a risky choice to make, depending on the chef that is cooking your food, which you have no control over. I usually order the chicken, which is seasoned and marinated to perfection, with a good portion given to you. However, I find you sometimes have too much rice, and end up being able to have one bite of rice and one bite of meat, or vice versa, and have to finish your meat with no rice to mellow out the rich taste (though too much meat is fine :D) I wouldn't recommend getting anything else as they don't season those enough in  my opinion.  As for the all-you-can-eat grill, it's super cheap, at what I remember of something like 13 dollars for one adult? anyways they give you tons of options of MEATTTT including beef, chicken, salmon for one deal and I think if you add 2 dollars for everyone you get Lamb and shrimp, which you should do, I mean it's only 2 dollars... You don't want to pass down the grilled beef, as it's in delicately sliced slices, marinated with a sharp eye for taste (or should I say a sharp tongue), and completely delicious. The grill all in all is great.  The service is mediocre, which is the only reason I'm taking off a star, since sometimes your order gets mixed up and/or it takes a year to get to your table at lunch.  All in all it's a great place to go if you want meat, but not a great place for vegetarians and vegans :D. If I ever feel the craving for tons of grilled meat, I'm coming here."}
{"text":"+1 to the comments from Emily W.  This is not Korean food.  It's at most Korean-inspired BBQ.  There's no banchan (the waiter just gave me a blank stare when I asked).  The AYCE comes with nothing but meat.  You have to pay extra for any vegetables (typically KBBQ will come with lettuce, garlic, peppers, and sauces to wrap your meat with).  Particular egregious is that the extra veggies cost $3 per person regardless of how much you get.  We had four adults and two children, and they ultimately charged us 6x$3=$18 for two plates of vegetables.  Regarding poor service, we also had to ask about four times to get the vegetables.  A complete and ridiculous rip off, especially when you consider that this is *free* at a real Korean BBQ joint.  There's plenty of good Chinese food options in the same strip mall.  I should have gone with my gut instinct and avoided this place.  Looks like plenty of better and authentic KBBQ places down Yonge.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"One of the Go-To places for Korean BBQ downtown, but since it's very popular (especially amongst the univ students in the area), it gets very crowded. Service is very slow in busy times, and depends greatly on your waiter. It's cheaper price for AYCE after 10pm iirc, but it's also way more busy. Your mileage may vary..."}
{"text":"This is a really solid Korean BBQ place on Queen St - less than $10 for lunch.  The BBQ short ribs and salmon were my favourite!  Service was good - the sides and meat kept coming as we needed.    Just visiting downtown for the week, I've been able to check out a few places for lunch/dinner and this was pretty good value/food."}
{"text":"There are several Korean Grill House locations in Toronto and this one is my favourite. It's not nearly as busy as they one on Queen Street West and the staff are much more relaxed and friendly (probably because it's not as ridiculously busy!).  I've only ever come here for the All-You-Can-Eat menu so I can't say anything about their menu items. I've never been disappointed. My favourite things are the beef, pork and chicken - although the chicken can be hit and miss since some of the cuts of meat are fatty and gross.   Trays of each raw meat/fish are brought tableside along with side dishes of kim chee, spicy & non-spicy beansprouts, pickled sweet radish, spicy potatoes and spicy tofu; and a bowl of white rice and pork bone broth. If you want more, just flag down a waiter and ask for more. Fountain drinks have free refills.   You put your meats on the grill, and enjoy when they are cooked! The chicken and fish can stick to the grill, so when the grill is too charred just ask one of the staff to change the grill top for you.   The experience is fun, social and great for a group of friends. I like this location the best because I could actually taste the pork bones in the soup, as opposed to other Korean Grill House locations where the soup is laced with MSG and salt. The cuts of meat are not as fatty and the staff are friendlier - or at least they don't treat their customers like an inconvenience."}
{"text":"Great pricing. That's what I love. The meat is quite nicely marinated and easy to cook. However, variety is not an asset. For a nice, clean, chill environment, this place would work. If you're looking at something more fancy, maybe look at some other places."}
{"text":"For $35, tax and tip included for two adults' All you can eat  + All you can drink.  It is an excellent choice for those who have never tried this restaurant.  It's BBQ, so you have to cook the food yourself, trust me, it's easy and doesn't take too long.    The meats are already marinated with excellent taste.  Also comes with different side dishes.  The place is getting a bit old now, does need a little facelift but definitely not dirty.  The service is pretty good, you always get what you order and they don't go cheap even if you order a lot!  A true ALL YOU CAN EAT."}
{"text":"This is not a high end BBQ house, I wouldn't say it is authentic too.  It is what it is, a good overall AYCE BBQ place.  The meat is good quality, very well marinated and tastes very good.  I've been to a few authentic Korean BBQ places in Los Angeles, I find this one better than some of them.  Authentic doesn't always mean better.  This place is pretty clean for a BBQ house and it's not oily or smelly at all.  The spareribs and chicken are the most popular items, all meats are marinated in the same sauce, a bit towards the sweeter side.  I also like the seafood such as squid and salmon fillet.  In terms of dipping sauce, there is only one choice.  They call it soya sauce buts it's not, maybe a lighter version of it.    You can choose to pay more if you would like items such as zucchini, lettuce or shrimp.  The price per person I think is about $3 more.  I usually don't go for it because i find the basic AYCE package very sufficient.  Drinks are not included but it's refillable.  They also serve Sapporo on tap.  Service is great when it comes to refill your drinks or water.  One thing to note though is that they don't penalize you for not finishing your food because they will take it back and give it to someone else.  It's raw, so I don't see a problem with that.  That's what they have to do to keep the price low.  Lastly, they put on a 12% service charge so you do not have to tip them.  I had a friend who used to work there and said that the boss takes a lot of tips away from the servers, so do not tip anymore!"}
{"text":"Korean Grill House  Came here on a Monday. It was relatively busy.  Service: Horrible. Waiters very disorganized. When you told them what you wanted. They would immediately forget. 1/5  Food: Slices of meat extremely thin. short ribs barely had meat on the bone. No ice cream or salad 2/5  Ambiance: it is okay. design is contemporary. 3/5  Price: $16.95 which is industry standard. For what we got, defenitly not worth it. Your better off going to Chako.  2/5"}
{"text":"This place is an abomination.  I have never experienced such shitty service before my meal tonight. I went for a good friend's birthday meal,  and he is an avid Korean BBQ fan. This was by far his worst experience; the meat was fatty and flaky and fell apart by itself,  the waiters were very snobbish and rude and included the tip automatically,  and they gave us only 1 grill plate for a group of 5. It was very cramped and very frustrating. It looks like I'll have to go elsewhere for my Korean BBQ y'all fuckbois"}
{"text":"I love this place! This is a tried and true spot for me, and I tell all my friends about it. The AYCE is cheap and delicious. The servers are friendly, and the satissfaction and guilt I feel after stuffing myself with lbs of meat is addicting. Not to meantion the great feeling that comes from grilling your own meat! Love it.  I could eat this every week. Ohhh, and all the delicious sides that come with? The Best! I loveee Kimchi! Yum."}
{"text":"I dig it!  I walked by this place around 10:30pm the other day, was starving after waiting to see the secret movie that George Strombolopolous was putting on in town.    The place always seems to have people inside so this time I decided to check it out.  I had the late night AYCE menu and had pork, chicken, beef, fish, squid and a bunch of their sides, washed it all down with some coke.  Its always fun to gill your own food, the meat was good, the sides were good, I left there full, definitely will come back."}
{"text":"The food was alright cannot complain about that tasty marinated meats ( I did have an unusual stomach ache after) but asides from the food the service and environment that the workers potray is very unfriendly and unwelcoming. The service also lack communication and basic customer service skills such as \"thankyou\" or \"your welcome\" and if your are looking to dine on a budget this is not the place as i paid $40+ for my meal."}
{"text":"up in richmond hill. arrived at 10pm   place was packed.  had the all you can eat for 4 people. Ordered the shaved beef, beef rib, chicken and squid rings.  It was around $20 per person.   Food was bland, no dipping sauce or hot sauce provided.  Service was great though.   Grill pan got gunked up pretty easy from the grilling but they changed it out if u ask.  I would not recommend the all u can eat, not enough variety in the options."}
{"text":"From a Korean person's standpoint, a pretend-Korean place. I suppose that doesnt make it a bad restaurant, the food was okay, but it does make it a bad a Korean restaurant and if you're looking for a Korean meal, you should never go here. They hardly even try to make it Korean, missing most major components of Korean BBQ. The website even says \"from China\". All employees are Chinese as well. It's pretty much just Chinese people taking some components of Korean barbecue and just doing their own thing.  Other than that, food is okay but not great still.  P.S. My Italian-Canadian friend totally loves it and had no idea that it wasn't Korean. I was the only Korean person in the restaurant and with good reason."}
{"text":"Food is great and the atmosphere is great.  But just be careful if you order the bb bop. If you leave your spoon in there it gets really hot and you will burn the piss out of your mouth.  My date learned that the hard way."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Korean Grill House Cuisine: Korean Location: Entertainment District Address: 214 Queen St W Price Range: $10~15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3 Service: 3 Ambiance: 2 Overall: 3  Extra information:  * Couple locations within Downtown * All you can eat Lunch/Dinner * http://www.koreangrillhouse.com/  Who doesn't love Korean BBQ? plus All you can eat? I am there. I checked out Korean Grill House on a Saturday night but thankfully made a reservation at 8:15 so we got to avoid the long lineup.  We decided to go with All You Can Eat Regular for $14.95 which includes Pork, Beef, Chicken, Beef Ribs, Ox Tongue, Ox Liver, Salmon, Squid and Fish Fillet.  I saw that many people were having drinks, but I decided to just get sprite. Just the thought of the extra heat on my face (asian flush) from the alcohol PLUS the grill, would be too much for me. Note that all fountain drinks are free refill.  They first gave us rice, soup and all types of meat plus the side dishes when we decided to order All You Can Eat. Sidedishes are tofu, potatoes, kimchi, beansprout and pickled radish. They were all pretty decent for a All You Can Eat restaurant. After the first round, they gave us a chart sheet to fill out to order more.  * Watered down sweet soy sauce to dip the meat in * Beef is surpringsly tender and overall well seasoned * Pork is average but the sauce was a little too sweet * Chicken takes awhile to cook and it just tasted like teriyaki chicken * I was surprised to see beef tongue on the menu.  * They are thinly sliced and marinated in sauce.  * The tongue doesn't take very long to cook and it was quite delicious  I enjoyed the short ribs the most. The marinade was little too strong (sweet & salty) and some of the meat pieces were very fatty but it was pretty good with rice Rice was much needed since all of the meat are marinated and the flavors are really strong.  Service is pretty decent, you just need to wave them down cause they won't ask you if you need anything first. I would say that the only thing that was bugging me is that the meat was taking FOREVER to cook. Also, remember that you can ask them to change the grill for you if it gets too messy and turns black. Plus remember to make reso when you visit this restaurant, I left around 9:30'ish and there was still a long lineup outside.  Summary: Korean BBQ can get quite pricey if you go to Korean restaurants and eat till you are full. If you aren't too picky about the quality of meat and a little bit of MSG, Korean Grill House isn't that bad once in awhile. For $14.95 it will def fill you up. Just remember that you will end up walking out like you swallowed BBQ meat."}
{"text":"It's Friday night.  I was looking to go for some Japanese one but they were all too busy. I ended up I have to go here.  The food is not very fresh. Taste was ok.  But not as good as before. After I ate the food.  I felt stomachache , both me and my friend. Might not return."}
{"text":"Food: The marinade on the meat tastes amazing. After a few visits, you just get tired of grilling your own meat. When the bibimbap is served to you, it comes in sizzling, they add in the hot pepper paste, crack an egg on top and stir it in front of you. Eating from a hot stone bowl is a nice experience. It was too much for me to eat so I was happy they were able to provide a take out container for me to bring it home.  Atmosphere & Service: Clean, modern like. The place does not feel as homey as the family owned Korean restaurants, because it is a chain, it doesn't feel very authentic. This is part of the reason why I am not giving this place more than three stars.  Pricing: I usually go for the all-you-can-eat lunch special. It is reasonable."}
{"text":"Honestly, why does any other food exist?  It being my first Korean BBQ experience I cant really gage it but by anything other than the fact that my pants are tighter and I am one happy fatty.   Perfection."}
{"text":"This is NOT Korean BBQ. The meat is so thin it sticks to the pan, everything on the lunch menu is marinated (my friends and I filled up on water and rice to balance out the sodium), and the vegetables (that usually come with kBBQ) were extra... The side dishes were fine. Please don't take friends who have experienced actual kBBQ here; they will be disappointed..."}
{"text":"Korean BBQ lots of great seasoned meat cut thin it cooks fast  I have nothing to compare this place to, BUT... it was delicious. The bad thing is you have to cook it your self. I did not find that fun but my family did. If you go for Lunch 11:30 -3pm its only $10.00 per person all you can eat and they bring a lot of meat out."}
{"text":"Very reasonable price, food was too good and the service was excellent by new generation.All were young and cute. Very well behaved.. I will go there again and again."}
{"text":"Beware of the seating arrangements. They will insist on sitting you in a particular area. We had a group of 5, and was separated to sit at 2 different tables, instead of sitting us at a table of 6, where there was no one sitting, nor was it reserved.   Server also takes awhile to come back to you."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE this place. I have been going here for over 4 years now! Meat is nicely marinated. We always get the all you can eat minus the lamb and stuff. There are a couple options.  I enjoy the fact that you can cook for yourself. First off you can cook your meat how you like it and it's a fun experience to share.  I enjoy going with my husband. Only reason I gave it a 4 is the service is quite slow. Sometimes you ask for something and they take a while to get to you. I know at times it's busy so it is a lot to manage but then more staff should be on hand.  Overall great place! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Good place for Korean bbq  in downtown core. I ordered all beef..sometimes fish and chicken. Good food and prices."}
{"text":"This is an authentic Korean BBQ spot in Markham. Up late (3am) and hungry? Welcome to Korean Grill House, where you walk in hungry and walk out letting the whole world know you what you had. =_= The restaurant is large , able to seat around 100 people easily.   It's almost always busy , so be prepared to wait. If you are in the area, be sure to call ahead and reserve a table.  The service is fast but very difficult to recognize which staff member is actually a server and which one is the buss-boy and/or hostess. They all act like they are electrically charged Prozac poppers.   The menu for all you can eat buffet ($10)is only available after 10pm. If you happen to be here at 9:55pm, they won't serve you... literally until AFTER 10:01 pm. Lame.   The buffet includes unlimited veggies, fish, chicken and beef you can also order a pitcher of a drink with unlimited refills.   Don't expect the best quality of food. It says \"unlimited\".  Over all, this is an excellent place to come with groups of people for cheap Saki and grilled marinated Korean meat. Even if you have to wait for a table (which is max 30minutes), there's an old arcade with tekken 4 and street fighter on the right and a bubble T place to the left. How could you go wrong?  Fun fact: It so happened that I was sitting elbow to elbow with Shane Warren Kippel from Degrassi. He was having dinner with his dad. I couldn't care less for him....until I noticed his ink. The kid has arms covered with tats. Sexy. He now has my vote. ;)    xoxo M."}
{"text":"I was oh so disappointed with this place, considering my absolute fav thing to eat is Korean Beef.  so last night around 9:30 me and my friend were walking by and saw this place. looked pretty cool and I love Korean Grill so we said \"why not, let's\"  first, it wasn't busy at all yet it took someone to approach us around 15-20min from the time we walked into the door.  so first the waiter blatantly LIED to me lol. i ordered the Korean beef dish with veg friend rice. and my friend orders the spring rolls and veg fried rice  so the order came and i got korean beef w steamed rice my friend got a plate of veg fried rice.  they basically threw the plate down and left. To even get someone to help us was a mission. AWFULL. i finally gave up and walked over to the bartender, i let her know i wanted the fried rice and we never got our spring rolls. so she speaks in her orient language to another server who finally manages to track our server (this was about 30minutes - NO LIE) ironically the table beside us had no issues with getting their food or a server that came over a few times to check on them. now that the food is cold, the original server tells me \"NO , the beef comes ONLY with steamed rice\". i was so furious at this point i stared right at him and said \"REALLY????\"...(now note, I'm not a mean person, i was just so shocked because at the time when i ordered i confirmed twice if i could get the fried rice and he said yes on both occasions)  so i said \"never mind\" and unhappily ate my food. so 10minutes go by and again no one came (we were talking a lot too so we noticed the time in horror) so again i go to the bartender and let her know we never got our spring rolls. so 5 minutes later spring rolls appear at our table - UNCOOKED!!!!! i couldn't believe it.... in my life - seriously - ive never had a restaurant be so awful.  we didn't end up eating much of our food. - DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALLLLLLLLLLLL - considering we don't speak Korean but love the food, it was awful how they treated us. its not worth it at all. There's so many fantastic international cuisines and if every restaurant began treating people this way, then no one would appreciate the cuisine itself.  p.s : the rice was over sticky , the beef was mainly the fat and cold the veg fried rice was the only edible thing and even that got cold quick.  I wish there was a negative star or something because THATS how much i dislike this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, great food, decent price, yet dirty washrooms.  My friend and I went to this venue to have a chat. We ended up ordering one plate each, since we were there at dinner time (if we were there at lunch time, I definitely would've gone for the all you can eat).  Anyhow, we ended up being there well after we were done our meals, yet the waiters kept refilling our cups of water, encouraging us to stay there. The whole time we were there, there were other tables available.  We sat with our empty dirty plates in front of us for a while, but considering the fact that they kept refilling our waters and discuss what we were there to discuss, we barely even noticed that.  We got our bill after asking for it, and tipped rather nicely accordingly.  After drinking all that water, I felt the need to go to the washroom. Unfortunately the washroom had an insanely strong stench of urine.  All-in-all however, I definitely see me returning to this venue. The food was great, prices were decent, and not being rushed out is always appreciated and not overly common these days."}
{"text":"Korean Grill House is for those who want to eat a lot of meat but don't want to pay a lot of money. I've heard not so great things about this place before but I thought I'd give it a try and I was actually surprised that it wasn't bad for the price. It's the cheapest Korean Grill out there but make sure you get the beef ribs because that's the best thing they have. ($18.99 on weekdays) It is not authentic Korean-grill food at all, but you get what you pay for. Don't bother paying an extra $3 for the vegetables because it's not worth it, the pineapples are canned. This place is extremely busy but the service wasn't bad. This is not my go-to but it's cheaper than other places that I know of."}
{"text":"This is the ultimate place to go to for a great romantic eve with your significant other or just hit it up with all your boys or tha ladies.  I recommend the all you can eat bbq all the meats come marinated to perfection.   If you can find better I highly doubt it .:)"}
{"text":"Good service, place was kind of cold due to door opening and closing. Good place for a date and environment you can enjoy although it's located in a hard-core Asian plaza."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on Family Day (Monday). This was our second visit for this month. The food was great which is why we always come back and my daughter loves the novelty of cooking her own food. The servers were efficient, we had May this time. She was definitely an improvement from the last time we were there but I cannot give her sole credit as there were others that served us efficiently and accurately. Refills for drinks almost came as soon as you put your drinking glass down on the table. It felt as if they were lingering behind you just to refill your drinks. The food order was a different thing though, although the food order came the quantity was always off. We ordered four spare ribs and three came; ordered two salmon and only one came; you'll get the idea. I didn't notice it before but the bill came with a 13% service charge this time which was new to me so beware of that. Otherwise it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Eww...this is the worst bbq restaurants i've ever tried. How can it get 4 stars??? The menu is so limited and you even have to pay extra money for the vegetable. Therefore, if you think it's cheaper than other AYCY bbq restaurants, it's definitely wrong. And yes, you also have to pay money if you want ice cream too. The food is just ok but with its boring menu and its extra money for everything, I'd never come back!!!!"}
{"text":"Korean BBQ on a chilly spring day really hits the spot.  Korean Grill House is located just a block north of Yonge & Dundas square; there are two floors of grilling goodness.  When you arrive and are seated, you have the option of ordering from the a la carte or the all-you-can-eat menus.  We opted to go for the $9.99 AYCE lunch menu which gave us chicken, beef, squid and fish to grill (they had pork as well but we were going kosher today).  Alongside the unlimited access to meat, they have rice, soup and korean side dishes that can be replenished as well!  Service is ok, our waiter had his hands full with the packed first floor.  Korean Grill House is on the revisit list for cheap AYCE eats!"}
{"text":"Reserved a table with my family of eight acquaintances for the lunch bbq ayce consisting of chicken, pork, filet fish, calamari and cow at the price of $16 on a holiday  What stood out was the impeccable service granted by our server named Jack whose name I took valiant effort to remember, as he and his team were the epitome of performance, concentration and tolerance accepting every request my coworkers make with a smile brighter than the sun  If you enjoy being addressed a chef during the two hour duration while cooking food that gravitates towards your friend's bottomless belly then this is your utopia."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for a work christmas dinner (we have a very small staff), and overall we all had a good time. The service was pretty good, nothing that I can complain about. It wasn't too loud in there or anything so we were all able to talk and hear each other okay. They were quick with refilling the waters which I always appreciate.   In terms of their menu, I wish they'd have more of a mixed option for people who eat meat but also like to eat vegetables... there were very few veggie options on the all-you-can-eat meat sheet that you got, and you had to pay 3$ extra PER PERSON to get unlimited veggies! That seems a little silly to me. They should add an in-between option with some of the less-favoured meat products taken off and replaced by vegetables.   The bathrooms were kind of strange, and super cold but they were cleanly. Same with all of the utensils. The grills definitely get super dirty, but that's sort of expected.. they let you change it once I think? We didn't get around to it because we had 3 at our table but yeah. Kinda gross, but like I said, expected.   Overall, we had a good night. The staff were very accommodating to us when we did our christmas gift exchange, and they all said Merry Christmas! :)"}
{"text":"No words. So good.   The Korean Grill House is one of the Toronto institutions I try to visit whenever I'm back in town. Returned this weekend and the marinades were as good as ever. I would recommend getting the basic meat grill though, as 3$ pp for vegetables weren't really necessary (although this is no fault of the restaurant, the meat is just so good!)  All around, Korean Grill is just a lot of fun. They should do corporate events here. Seriously."}
{"text":"Eww. They should seriously consider removing 'Korean' from the name. It is NOT authentic Korean. The first time I ate here I frowned upon my first bite of the napa cabbage kimchi. the waiters all speak Cantonese, not Korean. that alone should ring alarm bells. I would go there for the fun of grilling meat with friends, but not for QUALITY Korean food. For REAL Korean barbecue."}
{"text":"I have two words for this place - DON'T GO.  Bad service, bad quality...  There are many other options for good Korean BBQ in T.O."}
{"text":"I will never come back here.  Although it isn't authentic Korean, I've always had a good experience at Korean Grill House... Except today. I came here around 4pm with a group of 7. We were seated on a table with two grills. One was working fine, but the one near me wasn't even hot enough to cook thinly sliced BEEF! (which would normally cook in less than 30 seconds) I brought this to the waiter's attention and he said that the heat can't go any higher.  Okay. I accepted it. But after an hour, I ate approximately two pieces of meat because that's how long the meat took to cook on our barely lit grill. I was starving so I asked the waiter again if we could move to another grill. Another waiter came by and told us again that \"all the grills are like this\" even though you can clearly tell that the other grill on our table was flaming hot.  We were the only table in the ENTIRE restaurant and it took us so long just to call a waiter over.  Eventually I lost my appetite just waiting for the food to cook. Not to mention that most of the meat was tough even cooked on the working grill. Oh yes, the meat is GREY! Meat was not fresh and was obviously leftovers. Everyone lost their appetite and felt sick afterwards. Thank you Korean Grill House for giving us all stomach problems for the low price of $22.02!!"}
{"text":"My go to for Korean BBQ. Love the salmon here! Everything is very well seasoned and taste great. However, service is not the greatest."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I have been very impressed.  The main item is their all-you-can eat menu where you can grill unlimited pork, beef, chicken, beef ribs, ox tongue and liver, salmon, squid and fish fillet.  During dinner hours, you can add lamb and shrimps to your selection for an additional charge. The staff is excellent and very prompt with refilling your meats and drinks. What I really like about this place other than the tasty meats and sides is the \"feel\".  It's maintained and looks clean unlike other korean bbq houses I've visited. When your grill gets really dark and crusty the staff will gladly change it for you. The restaurant is also in a great location.  When I first ate here I was expecting to pay at least $20 for dinner since it is downtown but was surprised that it was only $12.95!  That's how much I pay whenever i go to Koreatown in north york.  If you're ever in Toronto, do look this restaurant or one of its 4 locations!  http://www.koreangrillhouse.com/index.html"}
{"text":"\"Korean\"??  Really??  All the meats/fish are in the same sauce.  Blach!  The kalbi really isn't kalbi - short ribs??  I dont' think so...  Had to ask for EVERYTHING.  Korean-style is more like it.  Skip it if you're looking for real Korean food.  The only thing that's Korean is the service - curt and lacks attention.  Save the money and skip it."}
{"text":"Wow prices sure have gone up for kbbq in the last few years.... Late night now is 14.99 for 5 types of meat and side dishes. You can add 3$ for veggies. I remember back in the days it was 13.99 and you could get everything!   Anyways, food wise, not bad but nothing special either. Service is quite good and they are pretty nice. Only thing is, they're not very quick with changing the grills....  I feel like the meat is more marinated at Chako or maybe I'm just more used to that taste. The meat here was a little bland for my taste.   This is the cheapest late night kbbq around I think so I would come back here if I had a craving :P"}
{"text":"This all you can eat BBQ is actually quite good. I might have rated the food a 4 star but the service was lacking.   We came on a Friday afternoon during the holiday season. It's knowingly a busy time of year but the server did not come by to check on us even once. Water glasses were so tiny and don't expect frequent refills. I kept trying to flag him down for more napkins but eventually gave up.   Highlights of the meal were the beef, beef ribs, chicken, salmon and white fish. The side dishes were amazing especially the kimchi (best I've had in a while), the radish (so crunchy and refreshing) and the tofu. Lamb is ok, don't expect much. The sausage and squid were weird. The shrimp are good if you don't mind the extra work and mess peeling them (and ripping off the heads yourself...gross).  All things considered I definitely would come back but not during peak hours."}
{"text":"If you want to have large groups gathering, this is definitely NOT the place for you. I made a reservation for 25 today and we ended up having 28 ppl showing up. Instead of letting us have another table, the waiter told us we only allowed to have 3 tables max. So we had to squish everyone into 3 tables that normally fit 8 ppl per table.   The worst part is that the manager used a lame excuse saying that and I quote \"oh we have reservation for 20 and 30 ppl coming in later today. That's why we can only give you 3 tables.\" =.=  The food was decent, and the service was good after. But the attitude the manager had in the beginning ruin the whole dinning experience."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for as long as I can remember. I'm always here for lunch or the night owl special. Which can gone up in price over the years. Service isn't the best. Every time I write more than 4 per item, they'll only provide me with 4. I understand why they do it but it's annoying. You also have the call them over to change the grill. They won't just do it on their own. The meat taste like a lower end compared to other places I've had. It's more of a place if you want AYCE for a lower price."}
{"text":"Everyone knows you're supposed to gorge on pasta before a marathon. What should you eat afterwards? The answer: all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ.  I came to this outpost of Korean Grill House a few hours after finishing the Toronto Marathon (in October '08). I was so hungry I could have eaten a horse, but a bountiful supply of pork, beef, chicken, lamb, salmon, squid and shrimp--and of course pickled veggies--satisfied me...and tasted much better. The aforementioned items come with the all-you-can-eat menu selection. The quality of these meats is good. Sure, it isn't as high as the top-choice tenderloin on the a la carte menu, but at $16, who can argue?   As sore and famished as I was, I would have eaten in a meatpacking plant. Still, this KGH's ambience was impressive. The interior is modern and sleek, and groups of teens and twenty-somethings give it a fun vibe. For an establishment whose trade is animal flesh and fluids, the interior is remarkably clean. The centerpiece of the restaurant is a fluorescent bar at the far end. We didn't sample anything from it this time, but I bet it makes for mirth and merriment later at night. This restaurant is tailor made for a big, raucous party.  In the end, my companions stopped at two round of meats, but I polished off four.  Best part of my meal: the ventilation. After leaving the premises, my clothes didn't reek of pork fumes."}
{"text":"We had dinner here around 10pm and opted for a la carte. I had the green curry with veggies and chicken. The rice was a little dry and I feel it could've come with more curry sauce to help with that. Otherwise, it was good and my favourite part was the grilled eggplant in the dish. The service was also friendly. I might only come back to try their AYCE option."}
{"text":"I came here last night with two friends. The place is really big inside and it's always been full. We got the night owl special which was 12.99 after 10pm all you can eat. It comes with beef, pork, chicken squid and some rice and bean sprouts. We also ordered the veggies which is an extra 3,99 but it was worth it. That came with pineapple, garlic, onions, mushroom and some other veggies. I really like this place and for 12,99 you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This was definitely a new experience for me and I enjoyed every minute. There are some who say that if they are paying good money, they want their food to come to the table already cooked and that's one way to look at it, it does also take some time for the food cook, but it was the experience of it that I really enjoyed. It's a great place for anyone who wants to try something different from your everyday sit-and-be-served restaurant. Service is a little slow cause it's a pretty busy place and it's no upscale kind of place, but overall the food was good."}
{"text":"Out of all the restaurants in Richmond Hill, this one has the absolute worst service and quality of food. The workers have no knowledge about any of their prices and they've tried scamming us on multiple occasions. For their 10PM menu, they told us everything on the page was $14.99 for AYCE, but once the bill came they changed it to $19.99 because we ordered the pork ribs, even though they said EVERYTHING on the page was $14.99. On top of that, we were told the drinks cost $1.99 per person, yet when they gave us the bill they told us it was actually $2.25 each and it was a \"miscommunication\" between the employees. Lastly, their service is HORRIBLE and they never respond to requests for more food or drink refills, which is ridiculous considering they have a mandatory 12% service charge, and an extra $1.25 charge for using debit. Never coming to this restaurant ever again (CHAKOS is much better and the prices are way more reasonable. You also get way better service, although that isn't saying much considering how bad the employees are here)."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here in like 10 years and finally realized we had a Korean BBQ craving, all you can eat of course.   The raw meats are still really well marinated, as I remember. Super flavourful. Favourites are the pork, beef ribs and chicken.   It's also a very common request to request a new grill after a while. This is much appreciated when it gets too black and everything starts to taste burnt and charred.   The restaurant has been renovated (probably not recently), and is very modern. The MOST impressive part is how good their ventilation is! The restaurant doesn't smell, and more importantly we did not smell at the end of it. The secret is that the ventilation is built within the grill (rather than letting the smell rise up and above into a ceiling vent).  The bad? Good Lord the service was slow. We took over 10 minutes to be seated even though it looked like the tables were already set up. The employees move at a really slow and lazy pace, and don't seem to care. Everything we asked for took at least 10 minutes to come. No shock, the check (of course) manages to come super fast once requested.   4 stars seems a bit generous, but we were really happy with our meal and super impressed by the ventilation!   And once we finally got what we needed, we were happy campers. I still think it's my go-to place for Korean BBQ cravings, despite the dismal service."}
{"text":"Yikes.  Of the few restaurants I tried in Toronto, I have to say this fared the worse on my list.  We tried the AYCE BBQ menu; I noticed a lot of diners were students- the most acquiescent of all dining age groups.  After all, college students aren't going to complain much about food quality if the price is right.   Some time through our meal, we asked for the grill plate to be replaced again.  Naturally, when you go to these bbq places, the residual meats and other items tend to get stuck on the grill.  And when that happens, the burnt pieces turn into bits of carcinogenic nightmare.  Most places, and by most, I mean ALL the other ones I've been to, replace the grill plates for you automatically; Korean Grill House only does it up to 3 times.  After that, you're on your own and you're either forced to ingest these blackened chunks or leave.  Choose your health, people.  A lot of the items were sub-par meats; I believe that I was only interested in the ox tongue and short ribs.  I ordered with my eyes and wasted a lot of belly space, and I felt really bad because there are starving people in this world- therefore, I tried to finish as much as possible when I really just wanted to toss 80% of it away.  This restaurant is rated fairly highly and is very undeserving of its 3 & 1/2 stars.  It really set a precedent in my mind to take all the local reviews with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"Came to dinner here. My sister decided to get the shrimp fried rice and not go with all you can eat like the rest of us. Halfway through her meal she discovered a partially-alive fruit fly in her rice. We called the server who called another guy and he asked if she wanted another dish of rice. NOPE One fly is enough.  When the bill came we still got charged and it hard to argue with the guy in charge because of his broken English.   Conclusion: If a bug is found in your meal be prepared to still pay for it because you ate some of it.  Is there any way I can give any less than 1 star?"}
{"text":"As far as I'm aware, my only options for ayce Korean bbq are here and Chako. I've been to both places many times and I've enjoyed them. It's far from authentic Korean bbq, but to be honest I'm not that big of a fan of those (don't get me wrong, it's yummy though.. just not worth the price).   Anyways, back to the topic on hand. If you're looking to eat a LOT of meat within a short period of time, this is the place to go. It's all about quantity over quality here. I've tried everything, but the ox liver and the stand outs for me are the pork sausage (because I love sausages and they're a tad sweeter than regular sausages) and the beef ribs.   Service is hit or miss. A definite miss goes out to those servers who have tunnel vision. On a Saturday night I guess it's just too busy.. But then again do I really come here for excellent service?     Another thing that really bothered me is how low the grill is. I had to get out of my seat just to see and use the entire grill. I feel like I was the only one getting up though, so maybe my grilling skills were inadequate.  Not sure if I'll be back because I do prefer Chako, but who knows maybe I will (lol)."}
{"text":"Just so everyone is clear - I was here last september and I still remember the dinner like it was yesterday!  I was visiting Toronto with my boyfriend and we decided to check this place out after a local had mentioned it to us. It was a first time experience for both of us to try Korean BBQ and we loved it! I don't remember the specifics on what we ordered, but I highly recommend coming here. I've been to two Korean BBQ places in chicago since then and so far, this tops them.   I do remember trying Bubble Tea - the Green tea flavor. It was absolutely amazing. It's the only bubble tea where it resembled more of an iced tea drink with tapioca balls. Again, I've been on the lookout in Chicago to find something that is similar it and no such luck :( All we have here is smoothie type drinks with tapioca balls.   Since I loved Toronto and hopefully will be back again, I will def go back to this place!"}
{"text":"Rude service but all you can eat!  Food: 4/5 All you can eat meat is basic but good.  Service: 3/5 Fast but rude.  Environment: 3/5 Could be cleaner. Washrooms: 3/5 Okay. Worth it?: 4/5 Current go to lunch spot.  I love coming here when I am craving K BQQ and super hungry. Service is not very nice but fine if you are more into the food.   The meats are not super seasons. More of your basic meats but great for a post workout meal. Late is awesome but there aren't any veggies.   Thinking about it now makes me hungry and want to go back!"}
{"text":"I went there before the theatre this past week. I do not know, maybe it's me but I just didn't like it or am I just tired of the Korean BBQ scene.   The sides where limited, they looked dry in there tiny dishes. The meat was ok...just ok, I could not tell the difference between chicken and the pork. I did enjoy the short ribs but that's about it. I had a  Heineken that was good, but the rest, yech! I will not be back."}
{"text":"Jeez how the heck have i not wrote a review for this place yet?   Once a week regular me and my friends usually come here in the evening after gym to load up on as much meat as possible. I am sure when i first started coming here the AYCE price was cheaper but it is at $18 now for dinner and the lunch option is around $5 cheaper but fewer items on available.  They are good for a maximum group size of 6, anymore than that and you will have to sit on a separate table.  Ordering the food is straightforward and the service is really quick. My favourite items on the AYCE menu would be the chicken and the pork ribs both which are marinated before they come out.   Big fan of this place, my advice is do wear something that has some give around the waist.  The men's washrooms are a joke, if you go here you will know what i mean. Either you use the stall and squeeze yourself under a sink or you use the one stand up urinal and have to do the limbo while avoiding a nasty air vent right in front of your face."}
{"text":"I am changing my review from 1 star to 4.  They upgraded and did remodeling and improved the service. I enjoyed my experience there."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but left feeling a little disappointed.  The meats were good and the price is reasonable but after grilling and grilling, the grill becomes coated with burnt bits that gets onto the meat.  So, most of the meat you eat is coated with burnt bits :(    The salmon and squid were really yummy but like I said, after awhile, they become coated with burnt bits.    Make reservations or be prepared to wait.  Oh, and I think this location only has one high chair so keep that in mind if you have a little one.  Not my favourite all you can eat Korean bbq place but not bad :)"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last week for the first time. I thought their Pork, Beef and Chicken was really good. I had to try the liver, squid, and salmon and they were just OK, I would not order any of them again. The salmon just stuck to the grill and made a mess. The appetizers are nothing spectacular, I mainly just ate the Kimchi and the Tofu which I put on the grill because I think it tastes better warm. I don't know if I would go back to this one because I didn't love it, but I also didn't mind it and if I somehow end up back here then I will probably stick to the meat."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here to try their late night ayce.  Only thing good was the price of $13.99 + taxes.  They use a paper ordering system for your ayce picks, customer marks how many of each item they wish.  For the late night offering, it is beef, chicken, pork, fish, squid & pork belly.  Drinks are extra @ $2.25 for aycd.  Wife and I selected chicken, pork and squid.  We filled out the paper 3 times and we never received our squid.  Our first order of chicken and pork was short of 1 tray each.  the Banchan (side dishes) were kinda sad to say the least..tried the tofu, sprouts, radish & Kimchee.  Didnt get enough the banchan servings were smaller than other places we have been to.  The first bowls of rice we were served were tasty..however the 2nd set of rice ordered was different.  Seemed like it was from a completely different batch or brand (was also hard).    Also we tried to order from the regular menu..since we weren't really up for ayce that night..but due to the cook leaving early at 9pm..only the ayce was available.  Another downside..no dessert options as other KBBQ spots have.  Odds are we shall return to our go to spot for KBBQ (Chako).  We just wanted to try a different KBBQ spot.  Likely won't be back.  If they didn't mess up our order for squid and refill on the sprouts and tofu banchan I would have given 3 stars at least.  Would have given an additional 1/2 star if their seasonings/marinade on the chicken and the pork wasn't so salty."}
{"text":"I like coming here for the night owl's special, all-you-can-eat BBQ for ~$12 on weekdays.  The pork and chicken have a great marinade/sauce on them, and the unlimited sides are nice.  It's not very Korean - the kimchi side is the only way to tell that there's any Korean component at all - but it's still pretty tasty.    I've found the service to be pretty good, and the location is nice and clean.  I also recommend that half way through your BBQ, you ask a server to replace the grill for you.  Especially with some of the meats, the burnt grease can build up fast and start to occasionally catch on fire.  It's a fun place to go once in a while - I've been in pair, groups of 4, and group of 6, and it's a good location for any size of group."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Sat down for about 5 minutes and no one came to serve us. Asked 2 different waiters for waters and it literally took 10 minutes for WATER to come. Then it took 10-15 more minutes for food to come as if we weren't already starving. The food was also horrible. Sprouts weren't spicy. Kimchi also wasn't spicy. I understand they're busy but that's no way to treat customers. Definitely not coming back again."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for lunch during weekdays if you work in the area. Service is fast, and you can be in and out in no time. The lunch bento comes with a drink and soup. This wouldn't be my first choice for ayce kbbq though. Stick to the lunch bento if you come here."}
{"text":"This review should be a 3.5 but I'll have to settle on a 4 star rating.  Been coming here when I'm in town since early 2004 and nothing has changed.  I think even the prices are the same.  There's not much to add . . . all you can eat at a low price in a good location in downtown Toronto.  Sure the meat quality isn't top-notch but I don't complain when I can stuff myself for 16 bucks or so.  Went last night and the place was pretty empty at 7PM.  It used to be that you had to wait and wait and wait if you came on a weekend night but I guess not anymore?"}
{"text":":( I am sad to announce that my long time chinese-korean go-to lunch restaurant for their inexpensive prices and fast, good tasting food has completely changed. I went last weekend and we shared a chicken and a beef bento box as usual. The pieces of meat were just low quality (tendons and just tough), room temperature, and weren't sliced nicely. I guess the soup and sides were still decent. I remember a box was 4 bucks back in primary school, and its been raising since...now its $7 - $7.25...that's a bit much considering the quality decline. Okay, and then I used to love the pork bone soup here although it was never authentically korean. But wow, this time, there was barely any meat on the few bones, a few chunks of hard uncooked potatoes, a few pieces of shred cabbage, and the broth tasted artificial - it was spicy but lacked any meat flavour. It costed $10.  I would probably still go to the DT location for their lunch KBBQ for 15 dollars probably."}
{"text":"So im mad at this place because we had a reservation and we came early but they made us wait half an hour to be seated like wtf     food is mediocre. Lots of meat options its easy to over do it.   Only good cause its cheaper than chakos"}
{"text":"I was craving Asian food and my girlfriend suggested Korean BBQ and brought me here. We came in time for the Owl Special for $11.99 AYCE (All You Can Eat). We were seated right upon walking in with no waiting time and within seconds side dishes were being placed around us. While that went on our waiter turned on the grill and the proteins started to appear faster than we could throw them on to get them cooking. The taste was awesome.   We stuck with Chicken and Beef. We weren't too crazy on the Pork or Squid. They weren't bad but the clear winners were the Chicken and Beef. The problem with the fish is that it stuck on to the grill and would break apart upon attempting to flip it over.  Side Dishes: - Kimchi, Spicy Bean Sprouts, Pickled Radish and Tofu   Protein Sources: - Chicken, Beef, White Fish, Pork and Squid   Service is FAST and they come around often to clean and/or replace the grill. They never rushed us and my girlfriend and I were there for nearly 2 hours! We ate, rested a bit and ate again until we were too stuffed to function properly.  I will definitely be coming back. The experience and the food was exceptional."}
{"text":"1ere expérience de coréen à volonté à Toronto. Le Korean Grill House est très haut de plafond et aéré de partout ce qui évite les odeurs persistantes de graillon sur les vêtements. Le principe de la formule à volontée c'est 16$ et vous commandez autant de viande et de riz que vous voulez. Vous faites chauffer ensuite votre viande sur les grilles prévues à cet effet. Le feu est réglable grâce à une poignée sous la table. Avis aux petits malins vous ne pourrez pas emporter chez vous le surplus commandé donc pensez à bien rationner vos commandes sinon vous paierez un supplément.  Le service est rapide, bien que ce soir là le restau a eu un pb avec les machines pour lire les cartes de crédit.  Un détail important cependant : d'accord le système de bouche d'aération remplit sa fonction mais l'état des grilles est assez sale (pas mal de poussière accumulée derrière), sachant que ces grilles sont proches des tables il faudrait les faire nettoyer plus souvent."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I went here to go and eat the late night ayce Korean bbq And my friend said \" the grill is no longer lit! :(\" - friend2016. They turned all the grills down to the lowest settings and it now takes us 5ever to cook our meat. Service is slow and orders are sometimes lost."}
{"text":"We went as a group of eight for dinner. We ordered the seafood soup, bone soup, and a number of raw dishes including pork belly, ox tongue, pork ribs/kalbi, bulgogi and a healthy amount of saki and soju. The soups were both very good, I preferred the bone soup. The pork belly and ox tongue didn't have much flavour but the bulgogi and kalbi were quite good. The soju was not great in comparison to what's available at other TO restaurants. Overall, our meal was fine. The food was fine but not memorable.  I would not dissuade someone from going here, but I also would not recommend or encourage a friend to eat here."}
{"text":"Was looking for food late at night, our first choice was Chako but they had line ups out the door.  Manager said the wait time will be at least 40 mins and the place closes at 12.  It was already 10:45 when I got there so we decided to head to Korean Grill House.    We were never fond of Korean Grill House after all these years but to our delight when we arrived, we saw a totally different place.  They finally renovated the place and it does look a lot better.  They had new cushioned bench for each table which was amazing.  However, the new grills are very deep and you got to stick your hold hand in there.  It was hard to see the stuff on your side of the grill so the person across from you will have to cook it instead.    The Mid-night combo only comes with Beef, Chicken, Pork, Fish Fillet and Squid.  Also, choice of 5 appetizers - radish (my fave), spicy tofu, bean sprouts, spicy bean sprouts and kimchi.  We also got some msg soup and rice with the meal.  Drinks aren't included and if you want veggie it is an extra $3.99 on top of the $9.99.  The place closes at 1am since it is a Friday night. I believe Mon - Thurs they close at 12pm.  We only got the meat - tons of beef, chicken and 1 pork.  The beef quality is not very bad compare to Chako.  It was super dry and hard.  It varies from tray to tray but most of them were bad.  We had like 5 trays and only 1 that was good.  The chicken is the best imo, so we order 4-5 trays of it.  The pork was okay but we weren't big fan of it either.     I was way too full to move after this and the comfy seats didn't help at all.  They take Credit card here as well."}
{"text":"Found this place using the yelp search feature as I was in the area. Felt like some Korean BBQ,  so I decided to try it based on the online yelp reviews.  As I have a tendency to eat far too much when I go for the all you can eat, I went for the mixed beef, chicken, and pork boxed meal. It comes with rice and a side of those spicey Korean vegetables. I drank tea as I am trying to avoid pop. For 7.49 plus tax, not bad at all. The rice was a bit too sticky, but the meats were great. For a quick lunch,  this place is excellent. They only accept cash and debt card, which could be an annoyance for large groups. Next time I am by, I will probably do the all you can eat."}
{"text":"this is a very bad grill house. All of the waiters were very unfriendly and they even pushed us to pay the tips they want.  I asked a waiter what's the difference between two kind of beer, he said: the difference is the name. WTF!!  Every waiter has a big attitude and look at you like you owe his/her money!   I swear I won't come this restaurant again and recommend everyone not to go unless you don't care the shitty service."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. All you can eat really is all you can eat. Short ribs and bulgoki beef both very good. They could use a few more side dishes and could refill them a little faster but otherwise A-OK. Careful with the bbq spatter if you're wearing a nice shirt.  My favourite meal all week."}
{"text":"I have to say, for a second round trying this place out, it turned out really well. Last I was here, we had a late night owl special for ayce kbbq. Tonight we had the regular price which is still all right (Total was approx $42 for 2 people).  When we got there at around 8:30pm, the place was suuuuper busy and there were a couple groups waiting. We were the third group to arrive and wait. Waiting time was all right, luckily, as 2 tables cleared out soon after we arrived.  I haven't been to a kbbq place in ages so I dont have much to compare with but definitely it is hands down better than Chakos! Theres more variety and just the food tastes better here. Now service was suprisingly spot on and impressive despite the fact that it was buuusy! Waiters frequently came to check up on our food/orders and refill our water/drinks which is definitely better than always having to ask for refills. One of the waiters was Danny and I have to say he was really friendly and gave us really good service. He added to the positive experience as well as several other waiters!  Overall everything was pretty decent and ALSO they recently added a new item to their menu: Pork Belly! It was good!"}
{"text":"You can't put soy sauce and a bag of sugar on beef and call it korean barbecue. The chicken tasted odd. The kimchi had sugar in it. It is just not authentic. I had kimchi soup and it was disgusting."}
{"text":"We loved this place! We went last year so I'm not sure if things have changed too much.  It was such a unique experience. The open concept was something we had been meaning to try for a while. It's a beautiful date idea because you get to work together to cook together and share the grill in the middle of the table. If you run out of meat or vegetables you can ask them to bring you more over for no cost. If you don't feel comfortable cooking and eating what YOU make there, you can ask them to make it for you. There's a lot of variety. One of our friends didn't like chicken, so we switched it up we gave him extra beef and someone got extra chicken. Needless to say we were all full by the end of the evening and had such a fun time.  Staff was a little rude, but they were really busy so I guess we could understand to an extent."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town but came to this place as its close to my hostel on Wider St. This place has a great all you can eat // cook at your table bbq grill for only 10 dollars- lunch menu. I got beef, chicken, pork, fish, rice and a whole bunch of side dishes that filled me up for the WHOLE DAY. I will say the quality of meat wasn't to best but for the price/service I don't think you can complain too much."}
{"text":"I'm not rating one star for no reason, but please let the manager teach the waiter name is May some manner please, we came into the store around 3, and she gave us the most shitty look and service in our life in Toronto! Her name is May, and we leaved the store right after! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Food is good the prcing is a bit cheeky for somewhere that serve cook yourself meats. The concept is very authentic and the all you can eat idea is genius!"}
{"text":"The only thing I like about this restaurant is all you can eat for a reasonable price and a good atmosphere. They provided an ordering form so we can number the items that we want to eat. Also, I like how they have the grill in the middle of the table so we can grill it ourselves. Overall, it was a good atmosphere.     Services at this place is average to poor. They get really busy and they didn't bother coming back to check on us and see if we want more food. We were ignored most of the time and had to remind them constantly if we want some thing for our table. The servers seem unhappy when serving.   Food taste is average. They provide good meat options but it appears that they didn't bother to take time to marinate it. All of them taste the same, salty. I would suggest ordering the beef ribs, lamb, and chicken. They don't have a variety of kimchi and it tastes average at best.   Overall, if you like to eat a lot and don't care about taste or service, go here. Otherwise, there are better Korean restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here whether it be with a group of 4 or 6, the waiters always seat us in a squished table with one grill. I always ask if my group can move to a table with 2 grills and try to make them understand that the grills are small and the booths are small, we can't fit and also each person would have to take turns to eat. Everytime they say no. Even though the restaurant is empty....they are extremely rude. Today I just came and they made us stand and wait for 20 minutes while we argued with them for a bigger table. Once we sat at a bigger table they tried to move us back to a small table. Great food. The customer service on the other hand completely ruins the experience."}
{"text":"If you like cheap quality meat and a Kbbq run by Chinese people and don't mind the unauthentic experience, this place is for you. Nothing tastes authentic but it's good for friends coming together to bbq and eat.  Ladies and gents, don't worry fancy clothing here. The vents are weak and your clothes will smell like bbq meat."}
{"text":"The Korean Grill House is  location on Queen and University. The servers serve you any tenderized cuts of pork, bare shrimp, squid, Kalbi beef ribs, marinated lamb, Bulgogi, chicken, and white fish fillets and prepare them over the grill to your own perfection. This is a meal to remember for Bar-B-Q. You cook and their service you food. Let's getting it started again.  PROS: -All-you-could-eat -Tasty and marinated meats -The concept is great and it makes for such a great evening for every time I go to downtown Toronto -Great customer service with water and timing -Price is reasonable  CONS: -Very busy (long line up) -Parking (have to find one and pay for them)  OVERALLS: I have a great experiences and every time I am downtown Toronto I must a least go again and have some all you could eat barbecue.  PP SIGNING OUT! YES..PLEASE!"}
{"text":"Took so long to get water and didnt ask us to order for 20 minutes. Once we ordered they kept bringing us the wrong things and forgetting to bring rice when we ordered. The waiter knocked over my friends glass of water and by the end they included the tip on a table of 3. Never coming back horrible service"}
{"text":"I've been to the location on Yonge near Dundas a few times, and it always tastes amazing. The restaurant is always full, but the service still manages to be good.  It's probably not \"authentic\" Korean food, but every item on their menu I've tried tasted incredible. I especially love their kimchi, everywhere else I've tried just makes it spicy, but these guys make theirs sour too."}
{"text":"i admit, i avoided this place like the plague. i had pre-conceptions - being on that strip of queen and all...   but boy, was i wrong! the food was fast and tasty! plus they had salmon bi bim bap, which i had not seen at other korean joints.  my only beefs:  - i like to mix my own bi bim bap with LOTS of hot sauce that i add in increments, progressively getting spicier and redder. i think it's the closest thing to playing with your food. they do it for you here and then take the sauce away. no play time :( - the korean restaurants i frequent frequently serve an array of little apps. they didn't here :("}
{"text":"Amazing food! I only wish I was closer :( ... you do have to get their attention a lot to keep your food coming but that is no big deal. They are busy. I get it. It's fun cooking your meat and the prices are not bad at all."}
{"text":"Really straight forward review - based on the three stars, it was A-OK. This was my first Korean BBQ experience, and it wasn't terrible at all but it also wasn't \"AMAZING\". The waiters don't seem as friendly or talkative as other waiters that I've had (at other places), and I feel that it should being sociable and talkative should be important as a waiter/waitress.  If this is your first time going to a korean BBQ, I strongly suggest bringing at least one person who is experienced in the \"fine art\" (LOL) of grilling, because it isn't something everyone can pick up right away.   The restaurant itself is very nice, the atmosphere isn't very calm though but isn't unpleasant.   Would I go back there? Not with a small group of friends, you won't get an intimate experience... Maybe with larger groups."}
{"text":"I really like Korean grill house. It's the best place to go if you are hungry and are feeling an all u can eat kinda vibe. With a good deal for beer and all you can eat beef pork and sausage you really cannot complain! Service is on point and checks in on the regular. The \"happy hour\" times mid day and late night are great and is a great bang for your buck it gets very busy so it may be a bit of a wait but you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite lunch spots. The bibm bahb isn't as \"authentic\" as other Korean restaurants -- and it has enough salt to kill a horse -- but it's damn delicious, and it's my regular order.  Bonus points for prompt service and plenty of seating, which makes this a reliable lunch venue."}
{"text":"Very hard to reach. Traffic along the way and Parking Not Available. Ended going to their other branch which although a little bit far where we came, parking is plentiful"}
{"text":"I opted for the all you can eat, minus the shrimp and Lamb. The food was great but of course you have to grill it yourself which in itself is a good experience. I recommend this place if you want to only eat BBQ meat and grill. They do add small side dishes such as bean sprouts, tofu, Kim chi etc. which is a plus.   The service was great, very quick and responsive when I was there even when the restaurant was pretty packed.   Overall, great experience and I would come back."}
{"text":"I was not impressed!  The beef was tough and full of gristle!   THE CHICKEN WAS OK.  We felt rushed by the waiter although he did not say much.  Served ginger ale in a tiny glass:  not even half a can!   I will never go back!  Value sucks for the poor quality you get here!"}
{"text":"Rusted grills!!!! WTF who leaves uncleaned rusted grills to cook raw meat on? They should be closed down. It is so dangerous to eat there."}
{"text":"If you're hanging around downtown Toronto and want some buffet action, this is the place to go.  Korean Grill House offers a wide array of Korean bbq meat along with side dishes, select veggies and some sea food.  There are various options you can go for, but most people come here for the all you can eat menu.    I usually come here for the beef ribs, beef slices, and side dishes.  Everything else could be removed from the menu and I would still be happy.  The meat is usually pretty decent, although not the most fresh you'll see.  If you want the night owl special after 10pm, you'll get an even better value as it's served at a discounted price.  Keep in mind the late night owl menu is only limited to certain meats though.  Overall a great value for the money and be prepared to eat endless trays of meat.  Come with a loose pair of pants and some clothes you don't really care about, as you'll be full and smelling like BBQ when you're done here!"}
{"text":"All you can eat Korean BBQ for $10 for lunch.  You can't beat that price.  The meat itself is quite tasty and the side dishes are decent."}
{"text":"Okay, going to keep this short.   Was here last night. Usually we go to \"Chako\" down the street but my girlfriend and I wanted to change things up. For me, I've been hear multiple times plus multiple franchise. I usually prefer \"Chako\" cause of fresh food, decor, and service. This Korean grill is a hole in a wall but you'll get your money's worth. Why it's always busy!  Price for adult is $16.95 for all meats (lamb, beef, beef rib, shrimp, pork, chicken, ox tongue and liver, salmon, squid, and white fish), standard rice, Korean sides, and soup. What men usually want. Hence its mostly guys inside. We added an additional $2.00 for vegetables but STAY AWAY! Not worth it. Comes with cucumber, lettuce, Green pepper, mushroom, onion, pineapple, and etc. The pineapple was from the can (nothing compared to Chako's pineapple that I LOVE). Mushroom was tiny. Funny that there's lettuce. Why would you BBQ that is a surprise. We ordered a pitcher of Sapporo for $20, which is cheap for premium and wasn't water down.  One thing for sure...if you're here for cheap, tasty, and bang for your money...This is the place.    Sometimes my girlfriend and I just want to be guys and have beer and meat!"}
{"text":"(????) yeah~!  Nice to come here again!    My friends and me very like this place!     I miss here very much when I leave Toronto.        Finally I came here last night.  Not very very busy last night. So I got the seats very  fast.    Waiters are very friendly.  They gave me ice water first when I sat down.  I ordered $25.99combo.    Meats are look good and fresh.   lamb,pork sausage,salmon,and so on.  *:.?. o()o .?.:*   I got candies when I ask bill.                 Very satisfied.        I am going to come here next week."}
{"text":"Calling a restaurant cute is probably a bad descriptive word, but that's the feeling I had after experiencing the Korean Grill House.   It's do-it-yourself dining. You are a seated at a table with a hole in the center that holds a heated grill. The best bang for your buck is the all you can eat buffet for $13.95. It gives you a generous portion of different meats and fish, including ox tongue, ox liver and squid (which we passed on). They supply the meat, sides and rice and you do the rest. The 'cute' part of this experience is that you grill the meat yourself. It felt like a grown up version of a child's BBQ play-set; the little utensils, the little grill. It was just a fun experience.    However, there are a couple downsides to this place. For one, the service was lacking once we placed our orders. We had to wave down a server a couple times. Another thing is the cleanliness of the washrooms,  it was a pretty bad sight. This could have just been a one time thing though."}
{"text":"Most of the food was good chicken was brutal and service started strong but fizzled fast ,in my previous visits I would struggle to complain but not this time, hopefully just a fluke"}
{"text":"Food was good. As for the service, it was ok. We had to remind them to bring us water constantly. The atmosphere was good for a Sunday dinner. Nothing special. It's like all the AYCE korean bbq food."}
{"text":"Went here shortly after 10pm for their late hour special and noticed that it is not $9.99 per adult anymore! They increased the price to $10.99 just recently. Tables were filling up really quickly and service was getting slower as there were only around 3 servers that night. Overall, I liked all the meats especially the beef and chicken as they were full of flavour from the marinade."}
{"text":"Very odd staff with mediocre food. I'm a small girl with a big stomach and I'm not quite sure how you can ruin all you can eat...but the only thing that was good here was the ribs."}
{"text":"Lunch all you can eat meats for $8.99? Sign me up...   Service is pretty much non-existant, but I don't really expect a lot of service at what amounts to a buffet, but topping up the kimchi, rice, and drinks without being asked couldn't hurt..."}
{"text":"Honestly really bad food... Not tasty at all. My sister and I got sick the day after. But I thought it was just how it's supposed to be. It wasn't until my Korean friend took me to an actual Korean BBQ where I realised how crappy this place is. Maybe it's just me considering other reviews."}
{"text":"Awesome Korean BBQ!   We had the \"all you can eat\" and boy did we eat!    Multiple servings of side dishes,  lots of good meat selections!    Really tasty.  The only downside of the meal was that the cookers are mounted a little low in the tables so you had to lean forward more than I would have liked to cook the food.  Plan to drink lots of water though - lots of sodium here!"}
{"text":"Can here for lunch and got the AYCE BBQ lunch special.  We had Beef, pork, fish, squid and chicken with an accompaniment of ban chan sides.  Our orders were taken promptly when we arrived via relatively friendly waitstaff. The grilled meats were fresh definitely tasty however the pork was a bit on the fatty side send the squid portions were very small. The beef was probably my favourite out of all the available grilled meats for the lunch AYCE special. Be prepared to drink a decent amount of water while there as well as when you leave as the marinade is a bit on the salty side. The barbeque grill gets heavily encrusted with deposits of that and burnt meat which the staff swap out for cleaning grills while there. They do indeed charge 13% mandatory gratuity in addition to a dollar surcharge if using debit to pay. I would definitely go back but it would be nice to see a greater variety of items for the all you can eat lunch special. I might be more inclined to try something off of the barbeque menu next time to see how other dishes fair compared to some of the staple Korean restaurants that I go to."}
{"text":"The quality of the food has gone down so bad! I usually go to the hwy 7 location  which in my memory is still okay.  I ordered beef and the beef came up looked like pork and the color is not red.see the picture.  Thought it was a mistake so ordered one extra plate same stuff came up. The beef used to be thin and we'll marinated in my memory but now it just tasted weird. Side dish is another horror story especially the soup . Tasted like it's been in the outside for couple days and just been re-heated.  What happened? Just gonna go to Chako next time."}
{"text":"I'll keep my review short and sweet.  Great service, great prices, and great selection of condiments. Puts Chako to shame. I'm a regular, and the staff actually remember that I'm allergic to seafood and I like Ginger Ale.   When busy, it seems they add a 10% service charge to your bill, however. I'd prefer to offer gratuity with my own discretion and I usually tip at least 15%, or more of the service was good. For that reason alone, I have to take 1 star away.  Overall, a great spot to hang at for some AYCE Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"Friday Night Fun!! There is no better way to begin the weekend that AYCE Korean BBQ and lots of booze!  Korean Grill House is a great deal. For the money, the fun factor and the food-- everyone leaves happy. The cheap price point for food leaves more money for cheap wine (that somehow didn't taste that bad with the BBQ marinades).  I normally don't go for the fish because I find it falls apart on the grill. But I was so busy quaffing wine that my boyfriend did most of the cooking. He managed to get the fish cooked perfectly with very low fall apart factor.   My favourites are the ribs, squid, liver, beef and tongue. You need to be careful not to overcook the tongue because it gets really rubbery-- just a light grilling on each side is sufficient. But how to find the \"side\"? They don't pay a lot of attention to slicing the meat. We ordered a second round of chicken and it all came out of the container in one piece. No bother-- we just slapped it on the grill and waited a little longer.  I love the Kimchee and Spicy Sprouts. The service was quite efficient and much better than previous experiences I've had at the KGH on Yonge St. and they were great about bringing more of each to the table.  I always have a boatload of fun at AYCE Korean BBQ and this past Friday was no exception. A great bet for groups of friends for a cheap dinner before heading out to see a band or whatever you like to get up to after. Strangely, I never have a meat coma after eating KBBQ. All that meaty goodness and al-kee-hawl fires me up and arms me for the rest of of an evening full of hijinx!"}
{"text":"Love/ hate relationship with any grill house.  I feel like the price is what it is because it's probably not the best piece of mean that you are paying for  especially when you go for the late night price, the cuts of meat are terrible.   Anyway I usually enjoy my visit to Korean grill house much more then other grill houses because of the service and the cleanliness There's no smoke coming up from the grill which is a huge plus. I also like their marinates a lot better than other places. When I come for late night ($12.99) I always see them really getting deep in cleaning by the end of the night.  They never let my drink hit the bottom ( or water ) which is always good. I really like how they have the condiments like bean sprout and Tufo etc."}
{"text":"Actually a 4.5 stars.  Stopped by here with a couple old friends for the 10pm Late night owl special. It was something like $12.99 or $13.99, but well worth it! It's AYCE, and has selection of pork, beef, chicken, and some seafood as well (like calamari). There's also vegetables you can order as well which is included (such as peppers). In my opinion, the beef was my favorite and was the most delicious, and I didn't have much of the chicken as it takes too long to cook.   Their service was reasonable, as they brought out the food in a timely manner from when we placed the order. I wish they would implement an iPad system though where the order goes directly to the kitchen so we can minimize waiting time.  Overall, excellent experience here. I definitely recommend this location to a friend and will be back for some more AYCE late night special soon!"}
{"text":"This place is just average as far as Korean BBQ goes, food is OK and prices are fine but I dont feel like the meat is of the quality that it could be. If you are looking for AYCE and something a bit different than your usual, may be worth a shot but I would not go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Got the marinated salmon and it was soooo good. Not a fan of the beef soup because it just seemed like beef broth in a bowl. There were a bunch of side dishes that were brought to us and the server told us that we could have as many refills of them as we wanted. The soy sauce is sooo good and I dipped everything into it. My fiance got the pork,chicken and beef. Those were really good. I didn't see a brown rice option but I wish I had brown rice instead of the traditional white rice (just trying to keep it a little healthy). This is definitely a place that we'll probably return to. There is an all you can eat option too. Our bill was only $33 dollars and that includes 2 meals, a beer and Jasmine tea (which was great). A must try since you get to cook your own food. Which meant that I got to give my salmon a nice light char, mmm mmmm mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Having dined at all three Korean Grill House locations in the downtown core, I like this one the best. The decor, food quality and service are all far better than their location to the south on Yonge or the Queen St. spot Our server was great and wasted no time getting us started with wine and side dishes. For some reason, the other location on Queen Street didn't give us the Korean Sausages with our BBQ Meat. Not a big deal since I don't really like them, but my friend did.  The quality of the meat seems to be far better here than what I am used to. Liver was presented in thicker, meatier slices that allowed for better grilling and there was far less fat on the chicken and beef than I've seen before. Less of the sweet marinade, too-- which I liked.  Just an aside... what's with the girls piling in here looking like Kim Kardashian-- wearing stiletto heels, ultra micro minis and hair extensions? It's a laid back Korean BBQ joint. I know it's Friday night, but consider your comfort level for AYCE and the fact that your butt might drop out the bottom of that micro mini after eating here! Also, your extensions are gonna reek like the BBQ for the rest of the night.  I'm not sure why the ratings here are lower than the other two locations. I've been to all of them at least twice over the years and this is by far the best one.  Friday Night Fun!!!"}
{"text":"Vegetarians AVOID! Tried one of the only two vegetarian options and concluded that it would be worth the extra cost to get an Uber to Koreatown, where they bring all the cool extras with the dish. Here we had to order a side of the flaccid kimchi which wasn't too spicy but also wasn't too flavourful. (And took 15 to arrive.) Besides that, if you're at all compassionate, even being in this place is like being in a horror movie where you can almost hear the screaming of the cows."}
{"text":"Korean Grill House on Queen is a pretty good AYCE option. I've been a big fan of AYCE Korean grill for many years and have tried a good number of locations around the city. Unfortunately, my top pick has been closed for a few years and I have still yet to find a new favorite.  I hadn't been to this place for a very very long time but decided to drop by again recently. I was happy to find that the grills themselves were pretty good quality. Most people would jump into critiquing the food first but at a grill house, you'd be surprised by how an experience can go south when you're working with a wonky grill.   As for the food itself, it was pretty standard in a good way. It was pretty much what you'll find any another other Korean grill place and luckily that is just fine with me and likely just fine with most of you too. :)  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"In the world of AYCE Korean BBQ, Korean Grill House is really average. It's not great but it's not horrible either.  What keeps bringing me back here is that their lunch option is pretty cheap, the quality is decent for what you pay, and it's walking distance from where I live.  If you're looking for a great experience, then search somewhere else. If you're in the area and you need to fill yourself with copious quantities of meat, then feel free to drop by here. :)"}
{"text":"A group of seven of us came here for late night AYCE one  Friday evening and they were able to accommodate us without issue (seating was a bit squishy but manageable). I believe compared to Chako, this place is a bit cheaper (cost us $17.99 per person for Friday late night), and if you're coming for late night (limited menu), it has almost the same items on their menu (beef, pork, chicken, fish fillet, and squid).   The cons: Sadly, if you want vegetables that will cost an additional $3.00 and they had no ice-cream.  The pros: Quick service (especially since we were constantly refilling. We didn't order too much in one shot as there was limited table space) and good side dishes. (Would recommend making a reservation if you're coming for dinner on a Friday or Weekend).  Its an A-okay treat, enough to satisfy your once in a while KBBQ craving."}
{"text":"Do not go here. Service is horrible - some staff are nice but the older staff and the manager is extremely rude.   Took my cousin that flew from Orlando here for dinner and it seemingly started out well. Then our orders started coming later and some meat orders didn't even come at all.   Understandable it is all you can eat - and you are understaffed but at lease have someone refill a cup of water.  When time for the bill - a shocker to me for 2 people dining there - was a mandatory Service Charge of 13% on the bill. When asked, our server just said \"if you don't like to tip you don't have to pay it\" and I replied, \"well tipping is up to the customer and it's not supposed to be mandatory.  I always always tip 13% or more depending on service.   Then when the manager comes over and asked \"what's the problem?\" I repeated my explanation and his reply was \"All other restaurants are doing it, especially all you can eat places.\" Usually an added gratuity is added on bigger groups of either 4 or more, but I've never heard of mandatory Service Charge for 2 people.    I proceeded to say well please remove that from my bill and I will pay the tips cash - I was gonna pay by debit. (Also additional $2 to use ur debit card)  The same manager said - So if you are not going to tip then why are you wasting food? - pointing towards 2 uncooked meat dishes. I replied saying, \"because we're full and we ate all we can.\" Then he said, \"So basically you just order a lot and waste food and don't care about the restaurant.\" I looked at him and said, \"if I didn't care about this restaurant I wouldn't recommend and take my cousin here from out of town.\"   Long story short. Save yourself from confronting with bad servers with bad manners. It's not worth it. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"LUNCH: AYCE 9.99 The foods alright, but the grill is a little too deep.  Went with my younger sister and she was having trouble.  chicken's too thick, basically either burnt and cooked properly, or raw and not burnt.. they gave me lamb instead of pork ( I KNOW MY MEAT) which was not part of the lunch, mehh it was good. Many servers, but not really attentive.  AHH, so maybe 3.5 stars?"}
{"text":"You want five dishes of beef? Have three.   You want six dishes of bean sprouts? Have two.   We're missing four more bean sprouts. Oh okay. Here, have two.   It doesn't matter what quantity you order. You will always get main dishes in threes (beef, pork, chicken, fish, squid) and side dishes in twos (tofu, bean sprouts, kimchi, etc.) We followed up on our order four times and they still didn't give us what we ordered. It didn't matter if it was the same or different server. Main dishes in threes and side dishes in twos.   They said they lost the order sheets or acted confused. The servers were never rude or defensive about our missing orders, but repeated reminders can be a tiring exercise when you just want to eaaaaat.   I wouldn't recommend coming here near the end of the night or you won't get what you order. Their closing the is 1:30am but their last call is midnight and they'll tell you they close at 1:00am. Leave (Get Out). The second we sat down around 12, they told us our order (our first) would be our last call order.   I was satisfied with the food. The meat is thinly sliced so it cooks very quickly, and pork was the clear standout for me. It was delicious.   The bean sprouts side dish was really good too (they're small dishes so we ordered four; we got two. We ordered ten more; we got two.) Tofu was yummy too.   At $16 after tax and tip for the late night special, I left pretty satisfied. It's not bad. You kinda go here cause everything else past midnight is closed."}
{"text":"If I was only rating the food, it would be 5 stars. Everything tasted fresh and yummy.   The restaurant itself, however, is very dirty. From the bathrooms to the menus, there is a layer of grease/filth on everything. Before the food came out, I made a point to wash my hands again and not touch the menu, the seats or the table so I don't get it on my hands.   The service was mediocre at best. Our server constantly leaned over our food and table and we even had to send back a bowl of rice because his dirty shirt went in it. When we asked for anything extra, it seemed like we were an inconvenience and the server wouldn't even answer.   Maybe it's just me, but when I see a place this dirty, I don't want to come back. It just makes me picture how nasty the kitchen must be.   I will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Interactive meals are truly the best! This was my first Korean Grill House experience and I truly enjoyed it. I love being able to share small plates and being in charge of cooking your own food truly keeps things interesting. We sampled their fish, squid, chicken, beef and pork -- mixing any of it with the rice that was given was delicious.   I was surprised at how much seating was offered inside. One walking by might not thing of it being a big restaurant, but it really did seat quite a few people.  Service was decent - kind of slow, but not horrible by any means. I wouldn't mind returning!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is sub-par. Had a poopy napkin at my spot when I sat down. Then had to argue with the waiter about getting individual bills. Which I'm still bitter about because I told the person before we even sat down that we would all be individual bills and they said \"okay\". And then after the meal the waiter comes up and tells me they can only divide the bills by the table? Then on top of that they automatically take their tip so they learn nothing for providing sh!tty service.  Will probably go back someday. But am not planning on it. If I were to plan a Korean food outing I would suggest New Generation up on Bloor west of Spadina."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed eating here multiple times before but after making a reservation 3 weeks in advance, we came in for our reservation and they told us it would be at least a half hour until we could be seated. We were a party of 8 for a double birthday and felt like this was unacceptable as they have no standing room or bar to accommodate mistakes like this. They claimed that they never got our reservation but I know that I called once for 6 people and then called a second time to make it for 8 people so we were extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"To over eat or not to over eat...?  For someone with no eating discipline, it really is a serious question!  With a set bento dinner being almost the same price as the AYCE, it can be a tough call at Korean Grill House.  For lunch, a bento is a no brainer - slightly cheaper prices with their lunch menu and I can still get through the rest of the day without groaning about how full I am.  One thing that I did find is that the cuts of meat in the lunch bentos tend to be very poor - fatty, tough, and over-salted.  At lease with AYCE grilling, the fat will render itself."}
{"text":"No, this is not authentic Korean barbecue and yes you are paying to cook your own meal, but if you are looking for all you can eat grilled meat for a reasonable price then this is your place. I am not personally a fan of this place, I find the meat of poor quality. The food burns easily and the dipping sauce is full of MSG or additives, makes me thirsty afterwards. The service is so-so.  Usually come here for their all you can eat option. I think the ribs is generally the tastiest, the beef depends on the cut, the pork and chicken usually consistent. I find the squid and the fish not the freshest, and sometimes taste \"fishy\", so I generally avoid. I like the Chinese red sausage, but that's probably cause it's full of sodium and random meats. The kimchi side dishes don't taste that great or authentic. The rice is okay and the soup is a mystery to me, I feel like is MSG as well.   Feeling really \"healthy\" today I decided to order the vegetable addition for an extra $3.00 per person and this was highly disappointing. It comes with cucumbers (Really? Cucumbers and not zucchini?), scrawny mushrooms that fell through the grill, onion, green peppers and canned, I mean canned pineapples!!! Oh did I mention two piece of lettuce that looks like plating accessories, how exactly do you grill lettuce maybe I should have asked them! For the additional $3.00, I really think we should have gone to Chako for better meat and vegetables and fresh pineapples! Needless to say I will not be getting that option again. Whether I will come back? It will definitely not be by choice. I guess the late night special is a good deal if you want a cheap eat, but you will get cheap meats!"}
{"text":"Just happened to be walking around with my tummy growling and howling for some food.  Korean BBQ!?!?!  oOOoOOoOhhh...  Let me tell you, for an all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ that you cook directly on your table...Not too shabby!  You sit down, they hand you a menu with a la carte items, or you can pick the all-you-can-eat options...there are several, depending if you want fish or not and so on.  But what a reasonable price to pay and on top of that, they really don't care if you leave items you ordered behind.  Order as much as you want and as often as you want.  Busy grills at the center of the table all around and pretty chic modernized buffet.  Service is good and always coming around to either change your grill plate or refill an empty glass."}
{"text":"This place is good, depending on the location. I have been to 3 locations, queen St. Yonge and Gerrard and Midland and Sheppard. The worst one of the 3 is hands down the yonge and Gerrard location. Service is bad and the meat is not sliced as nice as the other locations. Still good though, I would totally eat here again."}
{"text":"Is it bad that a couple of the waiters already have my order without saying anything? lol Fun and interactive dinner with a loved one or party. Place is extremely clean and the service is top-notch. The beef ribs and sausage are my  favourite thing fo sho!"}
{"text":"Absolutely attrocious service, we had to order everything 2 times and confirm that it was coming even after that. The items we ordered were short of what we ordered forcing us to re order the missing items. I will never come here again."}
{"text":"The lunch/late night AYCE special is amazing here!  While it does not include vegetables, they can be added on for a small cost. I find the meat (the beef in particular) to be tender and well marinated.   Something to note is that they don't take debit - only cash and credit."}
{"text":"Korean Grill House is a chain restaurant that has a few locations in the downtown core, this location in between College and Dundas, on Yonge, another exists at Yonge and Bloor, and yet another on Queen St. West.  Here's the low-down: you grill your own food, in a firepit, in the middle of your table.  Good first-date activity? YES.  Safe place for the munchies in a state of inebriation? NO.  The style of the restaurant is very modern, you'll likely share a table - but not the grill - with many other restaurant goers.  The washroom at this location is again, shared, you won't find this out until you enter it.  I did a double take when entering it, as so many women where excessively primping and priming themselves.  They would of put a mortician to shame... that's another story.  Service was not so great.  I mean, the waitress was friendly and everything, but she was hard to nail down.  Case-in-point, it took us twenty minutes just to go through the whole bill paying dance.  Not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"Just when I thought I couldn't feel any fatter, I went to eat at the Korean Grill House.  Maybe I was challenging myself when I ordered the all you can eat Korean BBQ, but it was worth it.  The food was excellent and well priced and the wait staff was awesome.  The kimchi, radish, bean sprouts and tofu leave you feeling like you've even eaten a few vegetables.  We loved this place, especially my kids.  They had a blast watching the food cook before their eyes and we will definitely be back!  Kids 2 and under are free!   Most likely if you have stomach issues after you leave, it just means you stuffed yourself with too much meat. . ."}
{"text":"Great quality food, the atmosphere is warm and welcoming. Wide variety of meats, seafood and vegetables to choose from. The meats are seasoned nicely, not too salty. I come here a lot with my friends and they never fail to impress us."}
{"text":"Good food and great waiters... super friendly and helpful. The Fish Fillet and Salmon were not the best, they were too small to be grilled so they ended up sticking to the grill and breaking down to pieces. However the Pork and Beef ribs were the best"}
{"text":"Average experience, however felt a bit ripped off. It was quite expensive, as we ended up paying $78 plus taxes for a table of 2!   Yes it was unlimited meats and vegetables but there's only so much one could eat.   Don't think I'll be back, but it was worth a visit but not the amount of money we paid."}
{"text":"Been there at least half a dozen times if not more over the years.  The decor is modern, spartan and clean.   As far as Korean BBQs go, it is serviceable. Don't expect amazingly friendly service. Do expect spartan, speedy dish removal and copious fillings of your glass of cool, refreshing stomach-filling water. I am on to you guys!   To get the most out of the Korean Grill House chains, you have to go the All You Can Eat route. Which if you are hungry for just a mountain of meat & fish, then you really can't go wrong. The basics: Chicken, Beef, Ribs & Pork are all there and spiced too, which results in good flavour to be had for a cheap price ($14).  Shrimp like it most places is extra along with Lamb, so it you want to go the expensive route, just make sure you are hungry. The one thing that is good about them is that they will not try to skimp on you. You ask for something, they bring it. You want more salmon? No questions asked. It's just brought. Which is the way it should be.  I must admit I only tried two or three dishes off their menu in the past and I can't say they were memorable. So basically, if you are hungry for a lot of meat and you are going for a laid back fourth date or a night out with a large group of friends, then this is a great place. Because of the vibe, the and the sharing food \"experience.\" Which in the end is one of it's main selling points.  However for a more culinary adventurous meal, go to Korean Town."}
{"text":"This was the WORST experience that I've ever had eating in a restaurant.   It was \"AYCE\".  After a long day travelling from one end to another, my boyfriend and I were craving KBBQ or Ethiopian food. We decided to go with KBBQ (big mistake, with the location we chose).  Can You Spare Me A Grill? The service started out quick with writing down our orders and then being served. After that, it all went downhill from there. The first thing we grilled was salmon and...don't ever get salmon or any fish fillet because it cooks really fast so you have to be attentive to it and it sticks lie crazy and the grill was freshly attached for us. We requested for a grill change and they said it'll take a few minutes, that was no problem. After 8-10 mins, they forgot about us so my boyfriend asked another staff member to change the grill for us, they said another few minutes. We waited around 15-20 minutes for a grill change -.-'.   Please Sir, We Want Some More... We were still hungry after our first bowl of rice so like with the grill change, we ordered 2 more bowls of rice. My boyfriend asked one staff member, he said okay. After 5 minutes, nothing, the waiter came our way multiple times so i whisphered \"i think he forgot about us\" and truth was, he did. So, I asked a different waiter for more rice and he said sure. Waited, waited, waited some more then I captured his attention, gestured him a peace sign which signified for the two rice bowls that we ordered and then he remembered; we were soo hungry I would've eaten the marinated meats raw (the beef at least). First round was really delicious and then, more problems arised during second round.   Hungry, much? We put in our second order and found something shocking. There was a piece of sausage that looked like it was eaten but i'm pretty sure it was cut very poorly. That was a major red flag for us and this location, hence this review.   PROS: There was no line up because it was just the two of us - it was filling  CONS: Slow service - Beware of half-bitten/ half cut up pieces of food - Portions of food is not consistent  EDIT: MIDLAND AND FINCH LOCATION is the opposite of this review, will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Usually go to the Korean Grill House closer to Gerrard, but had a weird service experience the one time I came here, so prefer other location. Probably just as good though."}
{"text":"California Korean BBQ set the bar. Sadly this place does not compete. That is all that needs to be said."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere for a Korean BBQ.  Service was pleasant and fantastic from the quick and professionally trained staff. Would highly recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I don't come here for AYCA, but lunch and afternoon tea is pretty good. It becomes my go to place for lunch/afternoon tea on the weekend, fast service, good price, you can order the menu from both of the linked restaurant.  Pretty good place for a quick weekend bite."}
{"text":"The meat was fresh and well marinated.  The service was good and they were fast. However, the grill was too low and the chair was uncomfortable. I was in korean bbq before and the grill was set more comfortably."}
{"text":"Love the food here, been many times. Service is usually above par too. Everything is tasty, and all the side banchan are good.   I do feel like its gotten a little grottier over time, used to feel like it was clean and slick and now it feels kinda dirtier."}
{"text":"EVERY trip to Toronto includes a trip to Korean Grill House.  EVERY SINGLE ONE.  No lie. The ingredients are great, the ban chan is good, and it's AYCE, what more do you need?  Well, a shorter wait time would be better, but once you get in, it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"I was here with a couple of friends from work for dinner.  I was instructed to come up a set of stairs when I walked into the restaurant.  Once upstairs, I found my friends and sat down.  They were already halfway into dinner service and they let me know that the service was horrible and no one really understood english.  I wasn't going for the All You Can Eat so we asked the waiter for a menu so I could order an item from their dinner menu.  It took them at least ten minutes to bring the menu over and another ten minutes to get my order put through and fill up our cups with water and tea.  The dinner itself, surprisingly, was not too long of a wait and I decided on the Beef Bibimbap, which was very tasty and I demolished the whole thing myself.  While I was eating my dinner, my coworkers were on dessert.  Little did they know that ice cream was not included in AYCE and you have to pay an extra $2 something to order ice cream (which only consisted of chocolate, strawberry, vanilla, green tea and red bean).  Other korean restaurants I've been to for AYCE has always included ice cream and a wide variety of desserts in their dinner service.. None the less, I think I'll stick to my regular korean BBQ restaurants that charge more for AYCE dinner and includes dessert and sushi with better customer service.  Korean Grill House will probably be my last resort for last minute cravings for korean BBQ, the food is delicious don't get me wrong.  They just need to work on including dessert and having more staff in house to serve and cater to good paying customers that are cooking their own food in their restaurant."}
{"text":"(3.5 stars/5) nice layout and good service though speak slowly to server (English is probably not their first language). Got drinks and food in good time.  I tried the All you can eat bbq and was not disappointed.  I cannot compare prices but for dinner it's 18.99 per person and it seems like a fair deal.  Do not bother with the lamb and shrimp add on as the lamb is forgettable and you have to be a fan of disassembling your prawns.  The beef, pork and chicken are great straight off the grill or wrapped in lettuce with the red pepper paste.  The salmon was the highlight of the night.  It was fairly fatty and therefore very juicy and tasty off the grill. Tip- ask to have your grill changed half way through your meal to prevent food from sticking and flavors mixing."}
{"text":"Solid all you can eat Korean downtown. I have tried the more premium AYCE options in Korea town, but I still prefer the marinades used here. Service is quick and to the point, and you will be stuffed like a pig in no time. Just remember to drink water in between meats, and maybe wear some lighter clothes because of the inevitable post meal meat sweats. Lol."}
{"text":"KGH is a good place to eat if: 1) Authenticity is not a concern 2) You want great prices 3) You want AYCE BBQ.   First of all, it's Chinese owned. If you have Korean friends, they can quickly point out all the ways that the food and style is not authentic. But who cares, it's BBQ meat! It's always good! They are Chinese so as expected, service isn't that good.   Second of all, I come here for the value. It's cheaper than AYCE sushi. Every once in a while, you just want to stuff yourself with meat. This is one of the best places to do it because you can hang out with your friends or family while cooking together.   Thirdly, a lot of Korean places don't do AYCE. Some do, but they usually have restrictions like you only have 1 type of meat. KGH gives you several choices of meat/seafood.   I'd say the quality of meat you get is generally worse than what you get at Korean places. But that's more than made up with quantity. The seasoning is slightly off. Also, the side dishes are definitely way off the mark. But you didn't come here for the side dishes. You came here for mountains of meat. Get ready to feel meat sweats after eating here. And make sure you don't wear nice clothes. You'll smell like BBQ after and want a shower."}
{"text":"This place is anything but a Korean Grill House.  While visiting Toronto, decided to go to the Korean Grill House for some authentic Korean BBQ.  I should have known right off the bat this was not authentic Korean BBQ.  First off, the beef rib, chicken, pork and beef selections on the AYCE menu all had the same marinade which I've never seen before.  There were more fat than meat on the beef ribs.  Also, when someone orders pork at a Korean BBQ place, one would expect pork belly but the pork on the AYCE menu was sliced pork shoulder, again with the same marinade.  To change up the flavor, I asked the waiter for some ssamjang and gochujang but the waiter promptly replied that all they had was chili in oil. Not having ssamjang at a so called Korean Grill House is a sacrilege.  Also, the fire does not burn hot enough so it takes forever to cook the beef ribs and as everyone pointed out, the pan is well below the table so its hard to even see how the food is cooking.  Finally, I gave up and asked for the check to go eat somewhere else and when the check came, they charged my 7 year old son the full adult price.  When I questioned the waiter why my 7 year old son was charged full price, he responded, \"its under 7\".  The menu clearly says children 3-7 years old.  Either the waiter is a dumb ass or simply trying to cheat.  I called another waiter to question this and he promptly corrected the other waiter's obvious attempt to con the customer.  Overall, this was a very disappointing experience from food to service.  I got fooled into thinking this was a Korean Grill House when in fact this place should be called \"Chinese version of Korean Grill House with low quality meat, one marinade and no authentic banchan\"."}
{"text":"Giving the place a second chance was a mistake. If you're looking for fast service (or any at all), don't come here. We ordered our food and it didn't come for a good 45 minutes while people around us who came after us and ordered after us had their food - what gives? We gave the kitchen/wait staff at least two reminders to check on our orders. We wanted to grab a bite and go - and we were not having the wait, especially when hangry. The staff was generally very dismissive and lacking attention to detail. No tips were given. Also, when the food did arrive - it was mediocre at best. The rice was dry, the kimchi was weirdly sour and not spicy, and the meat was chewy. Would NOT recommend for the lunch specials or anything that isn't AYCE. Maybe their All-You-Can-Eat isn't so bad because it's essentially self-serve. But yeah... Not happy with this place or the experience. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"First of all, I've had plenty of Korean BBQ while in Korea and I have to say it's not all that authentic so don't expect lettuce, spices/dips as you would get in Koreatown on Bloor West.  That said, I really enjoyed the wide variety of meats in the AYCE option (chicken, liver, salmon, beef, squid, etc) which is more variety than you get in actual Korean BBQ restaurants.  Given it's AYCE, the price isn't bad at all.  Our grill got messy pretty fast but you can ask for it to be changed.  Grilling your own meat is always fun and the atmosphere is ok.  The servers seem a bit rushed so you need to flag them down when you want to order me or they'll just zip past you.  I would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Call me spoiled, being from the k-bbq mecca of the world outside of Seoul (L.A.), so I got to look down on this spot. First, some positives, like good bulgogi (not too salty and not too mistery meat) and the calbi, very tender and savory.   Here come the negatives: practically non-existent panchan - you would think that with such prices they would throw in some decent little plates! the portion of meat on the platter is also small for the price. The beer is also expensive, I suppose this is a Hollywood transplant.  bottomline, good-looking place to hangout, but frankly you could get better somewhere else. Also, keep in mind that AYCE usually means all-you-can-eat-low-quality."}
{"text":"Worst service fron this branch... I ordered some more side dishes and didn't even get them. When we asked for the bill, it nearly took them almost 30 minutes for the bill to come to us. We were about to ditch the restaurant. ALSO, we badely had water. We kept asking and only came for 1 refills.."}
{"text":"This is my first time I came to a Korean AYCE restaurant like this. I would say that the servers were young and looks more like university students working on their way to school. The food were good, side dishes were fine, and the price was just right comparing i used to patronized Mandarin restaurant at $30 AYCE price. The place gets real busy at sometime and the servers were so much occupied that their getting rude at the point where you can't even reached them and have to get teir attention several times.(sigh)...especially the female servers..are Koreans women have all this kind of rude attitude?. Anyway, will I go back at this place?...probably will.. cause I love Korean food that comes with Korean attitude."}
{"text":"Came here today for a late dinner for two. As some of the others have mentioned, this is probably not the best place you want to go to if you are looking for authentic Korean BBQ. Although the service was good, the food was mediocre at best. The selection was limited and the quality of platters felt average."}
{"text":"I must admit, I can only compare this place to chakos because it's the only other ayce k BBQ I know. The selection for ayce is smaller here, but they have a large menu for the non ayce portion. But then again, do people come here for anything other than ayce BBQ? The quality was okay - I found only the chicken to be well marinated. Even though the service was a little better than chakos, I'd probably give that up for the quality and selection at chakos."}
{"text":"Korean BBQ is one of my favourite and fairly regular treats.  I've had it all over the US, including Los Angeles and San Francisco but from a pure value point of view, this place is among the best I've had.  We were offered the $13.95 all you can eat menu, but it didn't include the seafood. I wanted to try everything so we went with the $44.95 dinner for two.    How often do you find a place that provides 5 star food with a great price? In addition, the service was some of the best I've experienced.  Our drinks were always full and the entire staff somehow served us simultaneously without any hovering.  We barely knew they were there.    We had Bulgogi, Galbi, salmon, chicken, pork, scallops and shrimp.  Everything was great, perfectly marinated, tasty goodness! My favourites were the Bulgogi and shrimp.    Banchan, the little appetizers that are brought out at the beginning really added to the experience.  The sprouts with peanut oil were the delicious, and seeing that we'd eaten everything they brought out another round.  I've never seen that before.  The restaurant is enormous with even more seating downstairs.  The decor is stylish and hip, very untypical of most Korean restaurants with nary a Hite beer poster to be found.   After nearly two weeks in Toronto, this is my favourite restaurant and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I love coming here for Korean BBQ.  I've been coming here for about 12 years and it's been consistently good.  The beef ribs are my favourite and really the only thing I eat when I go there.  The beef ribs are so delicious and so flavourful.    The last few times that I've gone here with my friends I did notice that their service has gotten quite excellent.  The staff is very attentive and friendly, frequently walks around the tables and initiates to ask if we are okay with the food and if we would like to order anything.  This is very nice as most know that Asian places don't win the best customer service awards around Markham.  For its price it's so worth it and we always have a blast.  Only thing is the parking is sometimes tricky as the plaza fills up quickly during weekends."}
{"text":"So u get cooked and raw food here. U have the option of cooking it ureself.  First time for me and my kids.  They really enjoyed cooking the food themselves.  The food was delicious too. The service was good and overall it is was a good experience.  Will Definelty come back."}
{"text":"Solid choice for an AYCE Korean BBQ experience. Came on a Thursday night with a party of 10 and was seated immediately. Great service. Most of the beef and side dishes were a bit salty for my liking but the price is definitely an incentive to go. Unlike other AYCE restuarants, they do have different prices depending on how big of a selection you want (Ex. Pay 3 dollars more for vegetables)."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this another shot because my girlfriend wanted KBBQ and we were in the area. I figured the price was right so why not. It actually just made more sense because of the time we went for.  We show up a little before 11:30 PM knowing that they close at 1 AM. I figured last call was at 12:30 AM so this gives us a little time to order a first round and then a little more at last call as we needed it.  First thing's first, they now have a \"no visiting\" policy. If your table is getting AYCE, you're getting AYCE. If you read my last review, I would like to feel partly responsible for this new policy.  Anyway, we get there and are seated quickly. It is an hour and a half from closing, but they are cleaning up the back tables of the restaurant. They sit my girlfriend and I at the 2nd table from the door. The draft everytime the door opens is a killer. I would advise bringing your coat, even though I left mine in the car because everyone knows KBBQ smell lingers in your clothes for days afterwards.  After we are seated, we are not given menus or checked on for 10 mins. I kept trying to make eye contact with servers to call someone over, but they would just look at me then look away. They were speaking a different language, naturally, but they kept pointing to their watches or looking at their watches as they spoke. Kind of felt like they were buying time so that it gets closer to last call in the hopes that we would eat less. Could just be my past negative experience talking though. Their service could just be terrible without intent.  Finally one waiter mouths \"menu?\" to me, and I nod my head just to get him over. We all know what I want already, man. Just please take my order. I ask for two late night specials, he hands me the ordering slips and walks away.  We order conservatively as my girlfriend gets full by basically just looking at the menu, but she wants radish. Mark it down, but of course, they don't bring it out. I have to ask for it separately.  The tofu, which I used to love, was bland now. It used to be well seasoned. I had to put soy sauce on it just to make it taste like anything.  The beef, chicken, and pork were good. Chicken used to be better, but the beef and pork were better than I remembered.  The bill comes, and I was shocked to see that their price for late night was now $17.99 and they included tip for 2 people. Huh.  Honestly, just spend the few dollars more and go to Chako down the street. The main reason we opted for here, and one of the only pluses that KGrill has over Chako is that they are open a bit later. The chicken is also better here than Chako, but the few extra dollars buys you better service, cleaner place (the bathrooms are still, and always have been, disgusting at KGrill), bigger grill, RIBS(!), and ice cream.   2 stars because of the pork and beef. Everything else, 1 star."}
{"text":"Caution: 15% Gratuity will be sneaked on to your bill. Even if it's a party of two. Pay attention!! Learn from my mistakes. They won't tell you.. Well they didn't tell me anyway. And I didn't see it anywhere on the all-you-can-eat order sheet. What I'm basically saying is that there's no way of you finding out without analyzing the receipt.  Also, they could do a better job marinating the meat before sending it out. Most of our food tasted bland.   I left the restaurant and then realized what had happened. So upset with this kind of practice (adding gratuity without telling you); it should be illegal. Anyway knowledge is power!  That being said, service was quick."}
{"text":"The great part about this was you have the enjoyment of grilling up your own food, the servers here are very nice.  It's a very cheap price for the types of food you get.  If you go here make sure you do grill your own meat, that is really the most fun with this place.  Lots of locations in Toronto. The meat itself is really tasty, and it's really affordable."}
{"text":"This place just did nothing for me, so here is my rant:  1. I came here with a fairly large group (10 people) and we got seated in an awkward table split between pipes.  2. The restaurant is also very loud and hard to socialize. 3. Maybe it's just me, but I also did not like how the grill was set lower, making it hard to cook on. Most of my time was spent standing up to even see the grill. 4. Service is terrible. We had to ask multiple waiters to come and clean our grill, which supposedly takes 30 mins to do. 5. Although the parking lot is huge, it's shared between many different restaurants making it extremely hard to find parking during rush hour"}
{"text":"As far as Korean Grill house goes I would say it's the place to go if you want to have a late night AYCE.   Pros:  Good Value for AYCE (Only on lunch and Night owl specials)  Meat marinated well and deliciously appetizing.  Had many good experiences, always keeps you coming back for more, However I would probably do intervals of one time every other week.  Good cook it yourself dining experience.   Cons: Personal Preference, at times after finishing you wish you hadn't eat as much as you did. (bloated sensation) and a sense of guilt for eating fatty oil foods. But then again its BBQ.  Place could be cleaner + more contemporary (I heard the place had been through a entire renovation)   Over all, limited selection of food mostly all meat, I would say that the only reason this deserves a 3 star and not a 4 is mainly because it fails to beat its competitor Chako in delivering quality of food and dining atmosphere experience. Korean Grill house doesn't have enough attraction traits that would make me choose it over Chako the next time I want to go AYCE KBBQ. I would definitely recommend if you have not tried  Korean Grill House."}
{"text":"V and I recently went to visit my preferred all you can eat (ayce) Korean barbecue (kbbq) place recently. And let me tell you, I was disappointed in how much I used to adore this place until this recent visit.  We usually get the basic options of K998, which consists of beef, pork, chicken, fish fillet, squid, beef ribs and sausage and although we don't usually eat ox liver at all, or salmon that much - I do order salmon from time to time though.  They do have an night owl option from 10pm to close (which is 1-130 AM, depending on which day you're looking at). I've been to the \"night owl\" option before but I don't recommend it although it is cheaper than lunch or dinner, I felt like most of the food were leftovers/the last of it's batch and it tasted kinda gross imo...  Plus, the store is open from 3 PM - 10 PM - this menu is seriously making me double checking with their timings via other sources...  They've recently added the ayce vegetables to the menu about 2-3 years ago I believe. I've only ordered this option once! Sadly, I don't appreciate grilled vegetables as much.  Upon ordering your choice, they provide you with an ordering sheet, and you can write as much as you want per item. \"Set dish\" is really \"Side dishes\", and when you pay for ayce, those are free~  This fancy thing was new when we arrived! It's just basically buttons to alert the servers that you need specific stuff, instead of waving/putting up your hand for service - some Korean restaurants have these as well. Although the service did not improve with these buttons implemented...  Our grilled food came before our side dishes and we still had to wait quite a bit before our side dishes came.. I love their kimchi here, most kimchi(s) are more on the sour side, but the ones here were slightly sweet.  Our beef soup arrived cold - for the first time ever. I was on the verge of complaining but V said not to, as you never know what workers may do - like spitting in it, etc. We actually really liked the beef soup here too.  /  For those who have yet to try KBBQ, they stack the plates of food on the side, and you just start barbecuing! Flip them over from time to time and make sure they're cooked properly before you chow down.  I would say that beef and pork are the fastest to cook - turning from pink/red to brown, whereas chicken is a bit on the thicker side so make sure that is evenly cooked! The beef ribs tend to get really chewy and messy to eat. The squids curl up when it's done but if it's watery when you bite on it, throw it back onto the grill! Fish fillet is hard to pick them up when you grill, so don't be surprised when it's all into pieces hahaha  When you're ready for more, you can fill in your 2nd order slip while the food is cooking and call for a server to come pick it up. We didn't eat for very long and we called for the bill after our 2nd order mostly considered of set dishes.  /   So let me tell you why I was disappointed in a summary:  - Took awhile for food to come (when there was barely anyone - just maybe 3-4 small groups of 2-3) - Beef soup came cold - this was the most shocking to me.. - Asking for the server to collect our 2nd order slip and the bill took forever even when pressing the buttons along with waving our hands and with them walking by... Some guy even nodded/signaled to me but he didn't even get back to us after...  In the end, our total came around $45 (tips included).  Overall, I was not pleased. Probably won't come back here for a very very long time. My cravings for kbbq has decreased along the years anyways since the charcoal-y/grilled taste have gotten stronger in my taste buds... Might come if some friends would like to, or for a family gathering - but other than that, I won't recommend this place. Not anymore, anyways."}
{"text":"Always a favourite if I'm craving AYCE Korean BBQ. It's conveniently located in the heart of downtown. The food is pretty good and the service is pretty attentive."}
{"text":"Outstanding quality and service with a busy but pleasant atmosphere!...make sure to try the lamb and make reservations!"}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-3 Service-3 Food-4 Strikeouts-0/3  Average late night kbbq place, but during lunch time, \"made in China\" is connected to this restaurant to serve lunch specials bento boxes along with other small items.   Everything on the menu is cheap and after ordering my bento, we are definitely getting our money's worth!! Had a bulgogi bento and fish soup special with beef. The price is right for the quality and quantity. The meet taste like kbbq meat, which could be great for me. The rice is filled to the brim and all the lunch specials all come with a drink, which was surprising for me. Definitely will come again for their lunch specials. Sooo cheap!!"}
{"text":"They have a system here of pre-cut meats/fish placed on small plastic trays so when you order lamb, beef, pork or fish it is all layed out for you.  The price is quite reasonable.  It is fun to grill things yourself.    The only complaint is that it was very hard to get the waiter's attention.  He paid no attention to the people in the restaurant.  I had to almost to go to the kitchen just to get more water.  It got no better so I had to get up a second time to get more water.  It was much easier to get and pay the bill.  There, he paid attention."}
{"text":"Come with an appetite!  You will definitely need it...  Don't bother ordering just an entree - unless you don't like food, and in that case I will have to ask you to stop reading my reviews.  The all-you-can-eat is the best option - you get an extreme amount of meat, rice, and sides for about $15.  They bring trays and trays of meat out along with little cups of sides - most of which are unidentifiable but all delicious.  Service is slow but who cares when you're stuffing your face with food you grilled right at your own table?!  I also highly recommend the bubble tea.  It comes hot or cold and the green apple is deelish!  There are small tables good for two people and bigger tables that can fit about 8 - so good for a casual date or a group night out!"}
{"text":"Not bad for meat lovers, but this place is open by chinese. It's not true Korean BBQ. They miss some key things a real Korean BBQ should have. They don't have pork belly, neither provide chinese lettuce?Doen Jiang sauce. And there are too little options for vegetables. The meat quality is decent and price is ok too. If you want to get full by eating meat in a real Korean restaurant, it will be much more expensive, so don't be so picky. You get what you paid for, so I will say 3stars."}
{"text":"If you ever feel the need to stuff your face with so much meat you nearly slip into a coma, this is the place for you!    The service is mediocre and the quality of the meat could be better but eating here is as much about the social aspect of gathering with friends as it is about the actual eating. I never come here with less than 3 other people and we always have a great time."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends for late night AYCE BBQ. $12.99 on the weekend after 10pm. Can't beat that! Different kinds of meat all marinated except for fish & squid. All delicious.  For sides they got the usual: rice, Kimchi, tofu & sprouts. Skip the soup as it wasn't that good.  They got water on tap and its served in a pitcher! More restaurants should do that!  Pretty spacey, great for groups, modern decor, wonderful service. I strongly recommend this place for groups who are looking for late night AYCE BBQ.  Gotta go, food coma, SYOY!"}
{"text":"Last Sunday , I went here with my bf and my co worker along with her 2 kids . my bf and I arrived early since we want a good table on a sunday , they sat us at a table that only have 1 grill . We was so hungry at that time , so we go a head and order all you can eat , a waitress told us that when the food come we only have 2 hours to eat and same with our friend who will come late , will be based on when my food come . I have been here since the first open move from Dundas Square , and this is the first time someone told me that . When my friend arrive with her 2 kids, 1 of them is 7 the other is 9 , they force the kids that 9 years old has to pay full price to eat , and the 7 is half price . The 2 girls cant eat much , so my friend decided to other them the beef rice hot plate so they can share , and she order a refill ice tea for herself , while she join us with all you can eat . The 9 years old kids have a few spit of my friend ice tea , a waiter come by us and embarrassing my friend in front of us , and be liked the drink is just for herself she cant share with her child , and make my friend paid for another one , the 2 kids couldnt drink the whole glass by themselves . We also order all you can eat veggie with our meal , for my second veggies , I have to ask 3 times for it come . At the end when we paid our bill , they put in 12% service charge in by themselves with out telling any of us, after embarrassing my friend in front of her friends and her children , slow service , and event argue with customer."}
{"text":"It a typical korean bbq place for the masses. I actually prefer this place over chakos. I find the ventilation is a lot better, I don't leave with all my clothes smelling like smoke which is great. They have the same offerings as chakos; chicken, pork, beef, beef rib, salmon, fish, and squid. Nothing too special but it satisfies the craving. I like the marinate on the meats here to not as salty which is good, still flavourful but without all that salty.  I really like the fish and salmon here I don't know why maybe I was craving seafood but I honestly could have just eaten fish and nothing else. The one downside about this menu is that dessert is not included in the ayce :( but like you are in the middle of downtown so there are tons of other options and probably better options too.    For dinner, the basic ayce is 22.99 and they always automatically include 13% tip. This location charges $1 for debit transactions. There is an atm in the front but I think they will charge you a fee as well...so like be prepared beforehand."}
{"text":"A few coworkers suggested this place to take my boyfriend out for a surprise, and I'm glad I did. It was a different experience for him since he has never enjoyed the concept of \"paying to cook your own meal\". We both had AYCE BBQ which included; 1. Pork 2. Beef 3. Chicken 4. Beef Ribs 5. Ox Tongue 6. Ox Liver 7. Salmon 8. Squid 9. Fish fillet 10. Sausage   ... and there was free bonuses that came along with the AYCE, kimchi, radish, potato, beef soup (broth only), rice and few others. Also their fountain drinks comes with free refills (bonus!)  We kept it simple and only ordered the pork, beef, chicken, beef ribs and sausage. The quality of these meats were amazing. My favorite was the beef ribs. Mmmmm delicious! The staff was super friendly, however slightly slow. On multiple occasions we had to get up to get the waiters attention, the restaurant has a currently flow of customers (which is def a GOOD sign), overall we had a good time/experience, and more than likely we'll go back again soon!"}
{"text":"Food was great but service was awful we waited around 55 minutes for a new grill pissin me off"}
{"text":"I have been to this Korean Grill House location for a few times with my friends. The obvious choice is to get the All You Can Eat Special for $14-$16 plus taxes. The service was all right since the restaurant was full of customers. The waiters kept walking by to keep taking our orders, refilling our cups with drinks, and they were very friendly as well. The marinade for the meat was very decent. There are a  lot of selection in the All You Can Eat Menu such Salmon, Beef Ribs, Squid, Chicken, Beef, Pork, etc.  The side dishes that come along with the meal (Kimchi, Tofu, Bean Sprouts, Beef Bone Broth) were nice compliments with the meal. I will keep coming to this location due to its location in the Scarborough area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.   Atmosphere was modern. The waiters were young and slightly trendy but the staff wear the same shirts. The tables are nice and large and plenty of space for a more intimate experience with your party. The volume was a bit loud but not unbearable. For so many bbq tables, their ventilation is amazing and they are very clean. We did not leave smelling like food. The clients range from couples to families and groups of friends.  Traditional table Korean bbq with all of the fixings! I was used to just beef bbq but they offer pork, chicken, squid, and a white fish as well. Very tasty. Advice: you can ask for what you want or don't want. If you don't eat pork or seafood just tell them when you arrive.  The price is amazing for what you get - $9.99 per person for all you can eat bbq. For the two of us with bubble tea and a coke, it came to $30. Very reasonable!  The service is less than amazing, the servers are busy with all of the tables and didn't stop by often. Once we got their attention they were friendly but not very happy. Not awful, but not amazing.  Overall, it was great quick stop for Korean bbq. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner.  The things we like were on the lowest price buffet option.  At most restaurants the kids pricing is for 12 and under.  Here it is 7 and under.  So the kids had to pay adult price... That was a little surprising.  The meats for BBQ were nicely seasoned but the kimchi flavoured side dishes tasted very mild and bland at times like it was watered down. Still good value... Would have been better if one of the kids could have had kids pricing."}

{"text":"I took some out of town office people to try this place.  For a Wednesday night the place was packed.   We reserved a table for 10.  Just well or we'd have a wait on our hands.    The fair is standard for Korean BBQ.  Ribs, beef, chicken, pork, fish and squid.  The place has various side dishes.  The pickled radishes were excellent as was the pickled bean sprouts.  I found the beef short ribs were on the fatty side with little meat.  The sliced beef, fish and pork were hits.  However, our table of five guys was underserved with just one burner while the table for two had their own.     The selection of beer was standard for Canadian brands.  I was disappointed the Asia beers were under represented.    The service was hit and miss.  The initial selection took a little too long which makes selecting the right meat to Cook first a priority.  So my choice was the beef as the food takes less than 3 mins.  Others will take longer and that does not bode well for the hungry people in your group.    Anyway, provided the \"grillers\" are careful all can have enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot in my university days but my most recent trip has seen the quality here go way down. Not only was the food not very fresh but I was being charged the regular price with one item missing from their AYCE menu. They told me that they've been out of that item for two days yet they could not bother to inform us prior to ordering or reduce the price of the meal. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Not very Korean. Not very special. However, it is All You Can Eat grilled meat. You do have to grill it yourself though because that's just how Korean BBQ works. Oh, and there's coke with unlimited refills. It's a bit more expensive outside of special hours and vegetables cost a bit extra.  The service is fast but there isn't much for them to do anyways. You fill out a sheet with the number of plates of raw meat and side dishes you want and they bring it to you. You can also ask them to change the grilling plate when it get too dirty or burnt.  I don't recommend it for anything more than wanting to eat a bunch of meat but it is good at what it does for the price it is at. This particular location is quite spacious and clean and I like it more than the other Korean Grill House locations downtown."}
{"text":"Sooner or later Yelp will add the ability to add half-stars..2 1/2 would be this rating.  My friend had been raving about this for the past few visits I have made to Canada. So, going into it I really wanted to like this place,  she ate (not in this location mind you) at the KGH many times before and had nothing but fantastic stories to tell about it.  We arrived on a busy Saturday afternoon for their 8.95 all you can eat lunch. Right off the bat we were thrown a curve ball when we were informed if 1 person wants something, it would apply to everyone in terms of billing.  IE, my buddy wanted to add veggies, for 3 dollars, but the server said that it would apply to everyone. I can see where they don't want you to share meals,  but when someone definitely will not be using something they shouldn't be charged for it.    The marinated Pork, Chicken and Beef were excellent, The Fish and Squid were not really worth our time.  We learned quickly that the first few items we cooked tasted excellent, then after that all we tasted was the carbon char of the grill. My friend pointed out that normally at the other location she eats at there are guys constantly scraping down the cooking surface for you in order to keep your grilling experience top notch.  After about 30 minutes, we were still hungry, but the plate was mostly black. We had to flag down one of the servers and ask them to change out the platter so we could continue. On top of not being able to flag down a server initially, they became very scarce all of a sudden. The initial person who took our orders, wasn't the one that got our drinks, and the one that got our drinks wasn't the one who changed our meat dishes, and the one that changed the meat dishes wasn't the one who took our order for milkshakes, (which btw took 15 minutes to get). It was all very confusing, almost like they didn't have any order and this was just chaos. (I mean, who gets the tip if 7 people did things for us?)  Towards the end of the meal even my friend said that she was not too thrilled about this place. The food was good, the service was subpar,  I would have liked to have what my friend wanted to give me. I don't know if it was because it was lunch time or not,  but giving people the ability to keep their grills cleaner or having someone do it for you would have made this a much tastier trip. Her and I will go to the other location for dinner in a few weeks when I am back up there again."}
{"text":"During my last visit I went to the location on Queen, this time I gave the Yonge/Bloor location a try. This run around was better in terms of the grill and the servers keeping up with swapping out the platters. However they failed to keep the meat coming to us so there were times of 5-10 minutes or so where we were just sitting around waiting to spot one of the only two servers on to ask them for more beef or chicken. We still didn't care too much for the fish or squid so we mainly stuck with the others. My friend ordered a long island iced tea and it come out tasting like lemonade with no spirits added. She was a tad disappointed considering it came up on the bill as 6 bucks , oh well.  I have decided to like this place even though your experience is mainly determined by the attention of your servers to be able to keep the grill plate relatively clean to avoid the char taste that happens because you can't scrape it away."}
{"text":"3 stars, only because there wasn't anything \"Korean\" about this place. Ya some of the meat tastes yummy but I didn't see anything authentic about it. I've had better Korean bbq honestly.  They don't serve lettuce with the meat which I hate because I'd rather eat that than with rice..  Service was eh. Our table had to flag down a server each time we needed something...  Also, the servers tried to charge us 5$ for each tray we didn't eat. Did this happen to anyone else?"}
{"text":"Fun place to go for late night munchies with friends. I either choose to go here or the Chako K-grill which is located close by.   It's a great place to go to when you're starving and just want massive quantities of meat and rice in your system. The food is pretty good and the vibe of the restaurant is lively.  Service here, similar to most other Chinese-run K-grill places, is not the best. It can get a little irritating when servers seemingly ignore you sometimes.   I think it's more of a luck of the draw kinda thing here. Some nights you will be paired with an incredibly attentive server and others you will be flailing your arm around for days before a server finally comes over.   This place does not offer ice cream in the AYCE menu which is usually the deciding factor between here and Chako (which does have ice cream for AYCE but is a tad bit more expensive).  Overall though, for the price you pay, I think the quality of this restaurant is OKAY at best."}
{"text":"Good restaurant to go as a group. You sit down and choose the buffet option. We got the basic 9.99 one chicken, beef (was salty), pork(best) & fish(kept falling apart) and oh! Frozen beef patties with stamps on them (Dont order). First and foremost you are handling raw meat and cooking it yourself. You have to let it get over done just to make sure it's cooked through (specially chicken). Handling the food with the tongs they give u isn't hygienic. Basically the same tong for raw food and then u use it to put cooked food on your plate. A big no no. Tip!  Get two tongs at least. One to handle raw food and other to handle cooked.  All n all will visit again. But just keep those things in mind."}
{"text":"The service felt very poor the entire time, the only good thing was the seasoning of the food. But in terms of the food being brought to the table it took a good amount of time, and the restaurant wasn't really that full. Now if this where a restaurant where the kitchen staff had to actually cook my food I'd understand, but this is Korean grill. As in AYCE cooked by you at your table. Now this is good in a sense, being that it can create a communal vibe between everyone at the table, but with out food to cook or water to drink it feels a lot like I'm in the DPRK, but in the end our bill came and low and behold our party of 4  was charged a gratuity. I always tip as a point of principle. But I see a tip as a performance bonus, And I guess knowing they are getting a tip regardless takes away the incentive to perform at an efficient level."}
{"text":"All was consummated to the crowning last slice. I had so much meat, I could'nt tell what i was chewing anymore. An addendum, figuratively, of 3$ if one should have a penchant for vegetables. Odd."}
{"text":"A low 4 stars.  I've been to this place twice so far. Both were late night visits.  And the first time I tried the fancy AYCE with all the options.  We enjoyed both the pork and beef options but weren't too keen on the shrimp and seafood were okay.   The shrimp comes with full skin, head and vein so it's quite a hassle...but the minimal offer of side dishes (esp the kimchi and radish) are great and it's a great low carb eat option for me.  Meats are of average quality so they are good when cooked thoroughly and eaten right away.  A star lost because the seafood options could be done better and the meats could be of better quality.   Just order the regular all you can eat and get pork and beef, cook and eat right away and you will be fine."}
{"text":"Good food..well you have to cook yourself.. but great place, good location and a decent price.   Would have rated higher if the service was better..been there a few times n  had to wait n call out to get food or drinks. . The servers always have a \"not interested\" look and that gets to you no matter how polite they try to be.."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but never for the BBQ.  Some of my coworkers don't like it, but others love it (coworker from Chicago absolutely loves this place).  I wouldn't recommend anything under 6 dollars as the portions are small, but I really liked their bi bimp bap (I have trouble spelling this).    It is very big portion and a reasonable price (8 to 12 dollars).  The coworker I went with today absolutely loved it.  The only thing I don't like is that if you don't get the BBQ, the side dishes aren't included, so you have to pay for them.  Still, I like coming here."}
{"text":"They use the same side dish served other table. The soup bowl is not washed properly has hot pepper chunk right inside. So filthy and disgusting. I called the server to ask for the ice water and she brought the bill and the machine instead. And i asked for the ice water brought water with no ince.. Never ever going back again. Stay away at all cost"}
{"text":"Bibimbap was mixed in front of me using white rice,and my egg that is supposed to be sitting on top got mixed in. Taste is not terrible,but definitely not up to expectation. It's a chain restaurant,so not authentic for sure,not even in the bbq all you can eat. We were 5 guests and all our dishes came at separate times,service is meh. No kim chi refill lol really? Veggie ramen is flavorless...If you're super desperate for korean food,then yeah this is acceptable. Otherwise,i suggest try something else"}
{"text":"One of the best Korean bbq place I have ever been...fresh and delicious! I really like their Kimchi ... I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Located a couple of blocks from Chinatown, the Korean grill house provides a fun atmosphere for friends, couples, and family really a fun restaurant for everybody.  The service is prompt and the prices for the all you can eat meat buffet is outstanding.  The meat includes everything from chicken, beef, to Korean beef ribs, Ox tongue, Ox liver, lamb, fish and calamari.  I would agree the fish is not that great on the grill, no matter how much sesame oil you poor, the fish always seems to fall apart so I would stick with the red meats.  Also there sides are great as well kimchee, spicy tofu, bean sprouts, and vinegar flavored radishes.  I love this place and always find a reason to go when I am in Toronto, CA!"}
{"text":"Been here once and never again...the grill...why do so many places use that stainless steel plate that just lets everything stick onto it and burn? In the end everything tasted BURNT and not very pleasant at all...I think the only plus side is it seems to be well ventilated? (actually i don't rmb too well but I wasn't overcome with smoke when i first stepped in, unlike some places I guess) Anyway I strongly recommend they change to some non stick grilling plates. Overall like every other ayce place...mediocre food for relatively reasonable price"}
{"text":"Honestly, I've been coming here for the past couple of weeks with my friends and it is by far the worst service I have ever received in all my life. They never bring the portions you ask for. Rude, unfriendly and act like they don't see you. Seated a table of 6 at one grill they seated other parties of 6 at 3 grills. They discriminate against certain races, very unpleasant and rude. Can't believe they're still in business.  Made a yelp account just to warn people of this place."}
{"text":"TOO MUCH RICE and NOT ENOUGH FOOD!  Our group ordered several lunch specials and all of us got way too much rice (such as the bibimbop) or not enough food (bubogi).  Also, they did not give us any pan chan (the Korean appetizers) that you traditionally get with your meal.  We will NOT be going back."}
{"text":"I used to go to KGH during my high school days and it was my first time coming back after 4 years.   Food was meh, can't expect much from the after 10pm deal (used to be $10 after 10pm, now it's $13.99) but service was bad. They were rushing us to order because it was close to last call, alright we understand and ordered right away. Gave them a star for actually giving us our 8 portions of each meat/side dishes instead of cheating out. BUT we were constantly rushed to finish our food while there was 6 other tables just hanging around and when we finished, one of the ladies came to our table and say \"you have to get out now\". AND they included a 12% gratuity on our bill for a table of 4 people so be aware of that.   Probably won't ever return again."}
{"text":"This is the worst Korean bbq I had ever in my past 21years. Spend 50 dollars for two, not a single veggie could be provided for all you can eat. Only a few choices of meet. MOST IMPORTANTLY, I got diarrhea just after 5 mins out of this restaurant. I haven't got any diarrhea for more than two years. Now I am not only hungry buy also upset about the food I had."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since I was licensed to drive and now I'm old enough to fall ASLEEP at the wheel when there's a nice summer breeze blowing by.  Back in the day when Korean Food did not exist to Torontonians.  How things have changed and it's not a negative comment intended at all.  The customers that frequent this place before now PACK the newly opened Chako just a block North.  THANK GOD that when I went to Chako they told my group it will be 45 minutes and we BOLTED out passing through the parking lot that resembled the Canadian International Auto Show more than a Scarborough Parking Lot.  It's like everyone immigrated one block North at the same time. I'm so glad because now I come back to this OLD hang out to enjoy the same Korean BBQ I've had all these years but WITHOUT the noise from the bulk immigration.  One thing I've noticed is the young gentlemen that served us, even the floor manager was too.  I even noticed one that was simply NEWBIE style all the way, seem so confused how to do his job while this other school kid had to lead him by hand every step of the way.  Another noticeable change is that it is no longer a PURELY Asian customer spot but more of a United Nations effort.  :-)  The AYCE menu items still taste good as the last time's I've been here and unfortunately SERVICE rating stays stagnant as it takes effort to wave over a nearby waiter to take your Order($13.95: Pork, Beef, Chicken, Beef Ribs, Ox Tongue, Ox Liver Salmon, Squid, Fish Fillet) or get Drink Refills($1.75 extra)  I'm not sure when, but they actually changed the location of the washroom so now you don't have to walk pass the kitchen to the back passing the JUNK of stuff on the side to your way to the dirty washrooms.    It now has a SPOT LIGHTED entrance with white tiles looking like a Shrine.  It freaked me out so much I didn't even have to PISS.  I'll check it out next time..."}

{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite Korean BBQ locations, especially because it's close to home.  During the winter months, my husband and I becomes pescatarian and this place is an awesome place for AYCE. The atmosphere is fun and exciting knowing that we are cooking our own food.  The meats are all seasoned well and the marinade they use for the meats are so good. The side dishes - Bapsang are so good, from the kimchi, spicy bean sprouts, regular sprouts, marinated tofu, marinated potatoe, radish, to the beef broth everything taste so good  When love to take family and friends to this location because the staff are awesome, service is quick and everyone leaves stuffed and satisfied."}
{"text":"The all you can eat includes chicken, pork, beef, short rib, salmon, liver, pork belly, and sides. You pick what you want and write it on a piece of paper. One portion is enough for two people, so don't make the same mistake we did and order two of everything for two people! Service was average, it took awhile to get our bill at the end of our meal but otherwise it wasn't bad. I can't speak to how this place compares to others in the city but I enjoyed it and all the food was delicious."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at a korean grill where you cook your own food.... It was AMAZING. The mini dishes at the being were all good, especially the tofu and the dou ya. The meats all tasted AMAZING. even if they were alittle burnt. The chicken, beef, and short ribs were phenomenal.  The kimchi shortrib noodle soup was ok though. Nothing compared to the grilling"}
{"text":"Decent meat and menu for the price, however the service has go to be some of the worst I have ever experienced. Came in twice in one week, and was given the same poor level of service."}
{"text":"Awesome price. Good food. Some grey shit in our food but whatever there were 2 other platters of the same stuff. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"We love the food here! They have the perfect marination for their meats & no matter how you grill your food it always comes out really tasty. Additionally we looove their fresh kimchi & pickled radish, it's sooo good.   Korean Grill House is a restaurant chain for Korean BBQ, & we like how at this particular location there is more seating space so that it's more comfortable for their clientele, you don't get that cramped-up feeling.  Additionally, the customer service is fast & efficient, & the place is clean & modern, will definitely return again in the future."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not authentic Korean, and I got sick after eating here the other day. My friends and I ordered the ayce bbq lunch, and I was pretty disappointed with what I got. The food didn't seem that fresh and the service was pretty crappy. There are plenty of other places that I would rather go to."}

{"text":"I allowed the current 3 star Yelp rating to influence my rating if this place because I am truly torn. We had a great time and a great experience, but being with positive people caused that more than the restaurant itself.   For those that are unfamiliar, this type of restaurant has you cook your own food on a small gas grill positioned in the middle of each table. If you want the \"all you can eat\" option, everyone at the table has to get it, so that there is no sharing if food that you didn't order. If you get that AYCE option, they give you a small slip of paper on which to select the items you want to order; similar to the way many sushi restaurants do.   There were 4 adults, 1 teenager and 1 infant.  Our server must have been under the impression that we came for the experience. He learned very quickly that we came for the food! We had just finished a day at Caribana at which we had walked no less than 6 miles. We heard that the place was AYCE and we came to eat all we could! Mission accomplished!   I told our server that we had never done this before, and asked for advice on how to \"do this\". He said that it was fine and we could do it any way we wanted. Big mistake! You can't tell a bunch of black people from South Carolina to do whatever they want because they will move into your house after that!   We started rather modestly; each person ordering 1-2 items. The trouble with that was that the portions are Asian-sized, but none of us are Asian. We began to drop our pieces of meat onto the grill and we even asked for reassurance. \"Are we doing this right?\". The server smiled and nodded and told us we were fine. That little bit of food was gone in no time. Lesson learned. On to round two...  We ordered a bit more this time and started to establish which items were our favorites. We still had empty trays on the table from the first round and the table was becoming a bit congested. My buddy knocked over his cup of water. The server came over with a towel and apologized with vehement enthusiasm. \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\" We found it quite amusing that he was apologizing for our screw up. Only in Canada!    At this point, we've got a nice spread of food going and the meats were seasoned to perfection. If you don't like your food at a place like this, who can you blame? You cooked it!   The kimchi was deeeeeelicuous, though I could have taken it with a bit more spice. We had beef, lamb, chicken, squid, pork...all flavorful and tender. Our server turned the heat down on one of our grills, which at the time seemed to be for our benefit. The grill had started to burn a bit and the food was now cooking more slowly. By round 5, it appeared that this was his tactic to slow us down a bit so that we would fill up.  By round 7, they had switched servers in us and they stopped checking on us altogether. We had to call them to get our drinks refilled, and they were probably afraid to come over in fear that we would order more food. The last couple orders had food left off and even food on it that we didn't request. By the end of it, we had tried everything; except the tofu.   The service wasn't great, but they remained polite and professional though they were often inattentive. The food was excellent. The experience was really cool. If you're into new experiences, you've gotta try it. Just don't be surprised if they've changed the AYCE rules since we left. It May now be AYCE with a 6 plate max!"}
{"text":"average Korean barbecue  came after 10 so it was cheaper at $18 per person but you also get less choices for meet you get fish fillet squid beef pork and chicken   it also includes bean sprouts rice tofu beef soup kimchi and radish not a huge variety given  the down sides is that you have to cook yourself which is fun at first but after it is tiring but that's just me   also at the bottom some black stuff accumulates very quickly and it makes the food have a bitter taste also if you're not quick it is stressful and your food will be burnt   the food is average and the best meat is chicken because it is the most flavourful   overall all the other meats are ok but not AMAZING  the service was a little clumsy that day for some reason 2 people fell down it was pretty jokes but mostly the service was good and quick  would I comeback again? maybe"}
{"text":"All you can eat for lunch between 11am-3pm is the best option in here! It is always busy which means the food here is very good. And I agree with this! We ordered fish filets, squid, salmon, beef, beef rib, chicken breast. To be honest, seafood lovers should try salmon with soy sauce. And beef! Beef is the best in store! We ordered four dishes! I would highly recommend meat lover stop by and have a try."}
{"text":"It was ok.  We were seated upstairs vs downstairs.  The downstairs is much nicer looking.   The beef ribs and slices were the best. There are heat gauges under the table in case you need to lower or increase the temperature.  Be careful as some of the fattier beef pieces can flame up quite a bit.  Ask for hot sauce if you like things spicy. Best to use your chopsticks when getting the cooked foods off the grill vs the metal tongs that were touching your raw meat.  Feel free to pour the sauce on it while grilling for more flavor."}
{"text":"Unlimited meat for $24, I'm in! Service is very quick. I mean they servers aren't doing the cooking (the customers are), but they are quick to keep the water glasses full, bringing the raw meats and bringing the check. The place is quite big and usually don't need reservations unless there's a big party going. Bathrooms are downstairs and are fair. There are some seats downstairs as well. The decor is not good, but the food is tasty and worth it."}
{"text":"Great deal for $16/person. Came here with my cousins and we went nuts on the bbq. On the downside, it requires a lot of patience, so be careful eating stuff too soon because you're hungry. It's not worth it!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while - the last time I came to Korean grill house, AYCE was $9.99 and they still had a location downtown. For a belated Valentine's Day and after a very long day, my boyfriend and I decided to get some AYCE late night kgrill. This KGH location is in markham/Richmond hill in a plaza with a ton of other food competitors. There's THREE bubble tea stores in this plaza alone. But the smell from kgrill is so empowering in the parking lot.  Their night owl special for Monday-Thursday is $13 for the basic meats. It's from 10 to 12 which is closing time. Lunch from Mondays to Thursdays is also $13. We got here at 10:40 when there was ample parking right in front and only 4 other tables with patrons. I like this place because it's the cheapest Korean BBQ place in the area that I know of, and the restaurants are always clean. Food is also sliced very thin which makes it easy and fast to cook. AYCE comes with rice, kimchi, beef soup, tofu, and sprout.  My boyfriend really enjoyed his beef, and I found the chicken okay. Their meats are a little salty (I remember it used to be sweeter). You can use the sauce at the table which is like sweet soy sauce. By 11pm, we had only ordered 3 or so dishes to get started, they came around and said it was last call. It was 11pm! Last call?! I don't know why they have last call an hour before closing if the meat doesn't even have to be cooked! We ordered another 9 or 10 dishes of meat and we didn't even know if it would be enough or too much.  Overall, best bang for your buck. We ordered 13 dishes for $26 which is really cheap in my opinion. The taste is okay - you get what you pay for. I'll probably be back (but at 10pm so I avoid this 'last call' business)."}
{"text":"I've been to several Korean BBQ spots in Toronto and this is by far my favorite.   I'm not sure why the rating is so low because the food was delicious and the service is always very attentive and quick."}
{"text":"Great All You Can Eat Korean BBQ. So what if the owners are Chinese? Does that mean they can't marinate meat for you to cook yourself?  If you are comparing this restaurant to an authentic Korean place, that's like comparing Outback to Lugers. But for similar Korean BBQ Type restaurants, this is one of the better options.  It's too bad they call all Cook it Yourself BBQ Joints Korean BBQ but live with it. It's still a fun place to eat at."}
{"text":"Only went in for a bubble tea to calm my nerves before getting a piercing done, but I'd love to come back and try a dish with lamb.  Passed by the tables and saw patrons actually cooking their own meat from the centre of the table. So awesome!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at the Queen street location a long while just to get bubble tea, but never actually tried the food.  It is an entirely different restaurant experience.  Cooking the food was fun and the staff were attentive. I would love the opportunity to visit again and revisit the lamb."}
{"text":"It's quite misleading as the company is called Korean Grill House and looks very fusion-esque, whereas the sign on this one says \"Korean BBQ Restaurant\" and looks more localized.  As for drinks (all you can drink), they offered soy bean milk (which I liked) as well as prune juice, for those who fancy it. It's fun to trick people into thinking it's iced tea. :)  PROS - It's inexpensive and worth it esp for the quality of food offered. - Service was prompt - Sauce was delicious - sweet and salty  CONS - VERY limited selection of BBQ items. Must add $3.99 for vegetables, and another $3.99 for Shrimp - Menus were sticky. ew.  - No dessert...  I didn't give it 4 stars because I'm not a fan of KBBQ in general. If you are though, you should definitely try this place out. Oh, and I docked another star for the limited selection of food. I would come again if I ever have a carnivorous craving for meat."}
{"text":"3.5  The price has gone way up since the last time I came (last year), so it's now $18.99 on a Friday night for their regular menu (without add ons or drinks). This also doesn't include tax or tip. For larger groups, a 13% mandatory gratuity is added on.  One thing I really appreciate is how they have salmon on their regular menu. What I don't like so much is that the pieces are really uneven. That being said, when cooked right, it's delicious.  Sauce-wise, while they have soy sauce, they don't have anything else on the table (and I didn't ask for anything else). I brought cumin in my purse (yes, I'm weird like that). It made things taste interesting. One of the biggest problems I have at Korean BBQ is that everything starts to taste the same after a while. Cumin was today's attempt at preventing that, and it worked.  All in all, at this place, you get what you pay for.  What I really appreciated about today's visit was that the service for my group booking for 21 was that the servers were very attentive. All our needs were met, all our orders were given to us WITH THE PROPER NUMBERS FOR EVERYTHING, and they kept our cake in the fridge, cleared our tables before cake, and gave us a knife and plates and everything. There was no cake cutting charge either. I had a member of my group who doesn't eat meat, so they also allowed her to order off the a la carte menu while still sitting with us.   I'll be back because they do group bookings right! =)"}
{"text":"Don't come here expecting Korean food - you won't find it. I came because it was in walking distance of my hotel and I didn't want to deal with the bus or an uber, but boy was it not worth it. I checked out the menu online before I came, and was dubious seeing that it was Chinese not Korean, and I wish I'd listened to my gut there.  I ordered the kimchi soup with beef, and the fried dumplings, since I didn't want to deal with grilling meat and I LOVE kimchi jjigae and mandu gui. The soup came out before the dumplings. It was extremely greasy, had none of the sweet potato vermicelli and veggies that are normally in kimchi jjigae, and the broth tasted more like mapo tofu than anything else (which, if you've ever eaten kimchi jjigae, tastes NOTHING like it). The dumplings (3 tiny tiny dumplings for $3.50) were extremely dry, light on the filling, and came with a weird syrupy sweet dipping sauce. The meal came with a few side dishes: kimchi, very very deep fried tofu, and a vegetable I think was daikon radish (but not radish kimchi). The kimchi... doesn't even taste like bad kimchi. I made kimchi from scratch once as an experiment, and it turned out pretty stinking mediocre, but it at least tasted like kimchi. This tasted like wilted cabbage with a couple red pepper flakes tossed in - not that signature pickled kimchi taste.  Unlike a lot of people on here, I have nothing to complain about for the service or the cleanliness, though there were only a couple other tables of people there, so that helps with the attentiveness.  All in all, don't come here if you like Korean food. You will be disappointed. 0/10 would not recommend."}
{"text":"Wow!  This was the worst Korean want-to-be restaurant experience of my life.  Where should I start...  all the meats were either too bland or too salty.  Service was horrible.  They never came by and they never volunteered to replace the grill.  I had to grab them twice to replace the blackened grill.  So they charged us for the lettuce and vegetables.  I understand.  But of course that doesn't include garlic.  Garlic (7 little slices) is $2.50.  \"Fresh\" vegetables which includes 5 pieces of lettuce, two old slices of pine apple, two small slices of green pepper, costs $3.00.  Oh, and one bottle of soju is $20.00.  And they have no spicy, fish, bean, or any type of Korean soups on their menu.  I was on a business trip there and made a big mistake of taking my colleague there.  Will never go there again.  I didn't care too much about the price because I was expensing it but this was ridiculous.  I really wanted to ask the manager to take the word Korean out from their name.   I've been to shady and bad Korean restaurants before, but this is a new low.  For you non-Koreans out there...  this is NOT Korean food!!"}
{"text":"I have never tried this experience and wanted to so why not on my birthday?  Good time, definitely enjoyed myself. Cooking food is a bit slow and can get annoying when the person your sharing your table with is cooking as well but still, worth it.  Very inexpensive yet very filling with the veggies and pineapple."}
{"text":"NOT AN AUTHENTIC KOREAN BBQ! I've had good and bad kbbq before. I've got to say this was the worst I've had so far, and I really don't think it can't get any worse. I am Korean, so I know what it should taste like and how the meat should be marinated.  This place marinates all the meats the same way. I only took a few bites and couldn't eat anymore because it was so bad.  I really don't understand why people are giving such high ratings for this place.  If you want real K bbq, there are a bunch of places in Ktown (on Bloor st w, between Bathurst and Christie stations) which also has all you can eat table bbq options."}
{"text":"$15 for weekend lunch.  Restaurant filled up pretty fast. Food was surprisingly good.  Liked the beef, pork and especially the chicken.  Did not eat too much of the fish or squid. Soup was hot.  Ordered lots of banchan, especially the tofu, kimchi and spicy sprouts. Liked the new decor and fact that grill is now deeper into table, great for ventilation. Only minus is service.  While the female waitress was fast and efficient.  The male servicers were definitely were friendly or service oriented.   Saw lots of people ordering bentos which are much cheaper but our guests wanted AYCE.  Would visit again.  This location is much more spacious than the midland location.  Also nice to get Marathon milk tea nearby after lunch."}
{"text":"AVOID!!! If you ever see those white square plates at a Korean BBQ, it's fake and owned by a Chinese person.  It's not Korean food at all.  Korean Grill House franchises are all horrible with bad quality food and service; the meats should not be watery with sauce or blood everywhere.  It's all quasi Korean food and you are better off going to Christie-korea town or north york at a smaller Korean restaurant that will serve you fresh meats."}
{"text":"KOREAN. MEAT. ORGY.  As I write this, I am in a state of carnivore bliss, having stuffed myself silly with delicious korean BBQ (artfully cooked by none other than moi, if I do say so myself). I've been to a lot of Korean BBQ joints, and although Korean BBQ House lacks a little of the authenticity that your typical mom-n-pop shop might have (what? no poster with cute K-girl holding a bottle of Hite taped over the cash register?), the food and service here is right on.   We ordered the Dinner for Two ($44.99), which included generous portions of bulgogi and kalbi, along with chicken, pork, shrimp, scallops, and salmon. Of course, there was soup and the usual banchan (kimchee, bean sprouts, spicy bean sprouts, pickled radish and marinated tofu), rice, and fresh vegetables. It's a LOT of food. They really should call that \"Dinner For Two if You Are Really Really Motherf'ing Hungry Or Are Training To Be Competitive Eaters,\" because even despite our ravenous appetites we couldn't finish it all. Let's just say that by the time we were about 75% done, I was getting the Meat Sweats, and leave it at that. The only thing snooze-worthy was the salmon (not bad, per se, but nothing special.)  The service was stellar during my artery clog-fest. My drink was refilled promptly, and they even brought out additional banchan when our little bowls were empty. The only thing that was lacking were the number of napkins, but if you don't eat like an feral child (like I do), you should be fine. The ventilation system in this place is top notch; it's nice to eat Korean BBQ and not smell like a grill house yourself for the rest of the evening!   One tip: arrive early, this place gets crowded. We got there at around 6:30 on a Friday night; when we left at around 7:40, we noticed that tables were beginning to be in short supply.   Mmmmmeat. Me likey."}
{"text":"Love it!  Had a bad experience in another korean bbq place - and had to erase that memory so I came here a week after.   all you can eat pork, chicken, beef, ribs, squid, fish, and lots of little side dishes. I was grilling up a storm! love this kind of atmosphere - just like how i love hot pot. no veggies for grilling tho... it would be better if they had zucchini, eggplant and mushroom for me to grill.   yum!"}
{"text":"I used to really like korean grill house. now with my new resolution of not doing so much all-you-can-eat anymore, this place lost its appeal. good food still."}
{"text":"Good food but service wasn't that great. Had to leave the restaurant before eating the cake, and the cake wasn't frozen properly, ended up all melted in the bag."}
{"text":"Really like the place. Servers are attentive and the seasoning of the meat is on par with what I expecr it to be.  My only irk here, although a relatively small one is that the grill is well below the table and I have to stand to see what is going on with my food. I do like the place as it is definitely spacious, but I just wish they followed the route of other Korean Barbeque places.  The only thing I have noticed other than their excellent service during the lunch hour, is that they do not accept debit, they only take cash and credit so remember to stock up on either before you go!  Overall, the restaurant is very welcoming and their lunch and dinner prices are ideal for customers and students alike who want to try something new, or are looking for a tasty treat in the area! Give it a shot, I know you'll enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"Place gets really busy ... And that's a good sign for great food!  Great Korean BBQ !!  Food has good marinade ... Attentive service.. Vegetarian options .. 5 out of 5 for me all the way !! Can't lie I'm a regular at all the Korean grill houses when I see them :D"}
{"text":"Every time my girlfriend and I come up to Toronto we always come here. It's turned into a little tradition. Will gladly keep coming back"}
{"text":"Good value for money especially after 10pm where you get a special price on the core AYCE items. Don't expect much in terms of environment and service - but it isn't horrible. Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"The restaurant on Queen Street was closed due to exhaust fan issues so we hiked over here.  The service was pleasant for the most part from all other helpers except one insolent server who took our order.  As far as the food, the wonderfully marinated single orders of lamb and higher quality steaks were amazing and what earn every star.  The vegetables were indeed weak, deep fried garlic was a tough disappointment and for the rest you get some tiny rings of green peppers and like one cut of onion.  Not worth 3 x the required every party.  The rules were overbearing.  We all ordered plenty of food with 2 single orders of meats and veggies and drinks, but \"no sharing.\"  Seriously, I spent forty dollars, let me try a shrimp without fear of reproach.  Also, if one person orders all you can eat, all have to for they fear your tablemates would mooch off yours.  This may stop me bringing a group as I'd prefer better steak cuts and there's no way I would be able to upgrade this."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group on a weekend for dinner and had no problems whatsoever. Korean Grill House is always a safe option for some simple all-you-can-eat Korean barbeque. While you are not getting amazing quality meat and seafood here, it is more than adequate. Just don't go expecting super authentic Korean barbeque here. This is a more of a chinese take on Korean barbeque.  We upgraded to the lamb and shrimp for a couple of dollars extra and is definitely worth it if you're a fan of shrimp. The lamb wasn't anything special or easily distinguishable however as it was the thinly sliced variety. My favourites were definitely the short ribs, chicken, and salmon. Thicker, and juicier cuts that were quite tasty and had some actual bite. The thinly sliced beef, pork, and lamb didn't do much for me, and required constant attention while cooking. The biggest loser of the night was definitely the ox liver, which was super dry and flavorless.  I also somewhat enjoyed the side dishes. Again, while they're not authentic banchan, they were alright. You had your standard (or not so standard..) kimchi, radish, bean sprouts, tofu, potatoes, and celery (?!).   Once your grill starts getting all charred up, ask your servers for a new grill. The food is virtually inedible. Service was fine and we didn't run into any noteworthy problems."}
{"text":"The thought of having to cook my own meal was a very interesting motion. So my first time at Korean Grill House I was excited to try something new.  I really like the selection of meat there is quite a variety to chose from, plus there are vegetables you can pick as well, I love veggies!! Especially with grilled or BBQ meat. The atmosphere of the place is a nice on great for groups of friends or family as it is quite fun to sit there and grill your meat selection. I recommend this place.   #30daysofyelp"}
{"text":"I'm being generous by giving three stars. Firstly, the name should be changed because there is nothing \"Korean\" about this place, all the workers are Chinese. Their service is okay, but would it hurt to smile and be more pleasant? Secondly, I cannot understand how people can eat here. I came with my boyfriend and we were the only people there because it was a tad early for dinner and then the place started filling up, I was incredibly surprised. Clearly, these people have never been to an authentic Korean bbq restaurant before or else they would not be eating here. The food is terrible- the side dishes were tasteless, the kimchi obviously came from the jar you can buy from T&T and the fried tofu tasted and looked like it was prepared a week ago and refrigerated. The tofu jjigae had NO taste at all and had an incredibly large amount of oil in it, it was really disgusting. Thirdly, the meat seems like it was soaked in soya sauce and salt. Ridiculously salty and fatty and clearly bought from T&T as it tasted like the lowest grade of meat available in Canada. Oh and I forgot to mention something about the service, they don't automatically change the grill for you, so if you do ask, it seems as if you're annoying them. Uhm, HELLO! You're supposed to change the grill occasionally unless you like eating charred meat."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here this weekend and had so much fun. The meat was good (shrimp is messy so eat it first) we got a bottle of soju for 20 bucks. I'm a light weight so mixed with ginger ale. Overall had fun and ate well left super full for relatively cheap.   Will go again :)"}
{"text":"Awful! I made a reservation weeks in Advance and let them know that it was a special occasion. They were rude, tried to deny we had a reservation when we were on the list and I could see my name, stuffed 10 of us at a table for 6, took 25 mins just to take our drink order, then refused to give us printed receipts and tried to tell us that tip wasn't included. FYI: tip is included. They added a 15% gratuity and denied it even after is receiving our receipts. Never again. I like to think I'm a person that's easy to please and I hated everything about this experience. Doesn't even deserve a star."}
{"text":"Cheap price to eat at for ayce kbbq with couple of friends. The service was okay. not sure about recommending it."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a bit spoiled living in Los Angeles where there are tons of KBBQ spots, but this place is straight up inedible to me. I paid $25 total for some AYCE option with I think Lamb and Shrimp or whatever. Every aspect of the KBBQ experience was a flop.   I pretty much tried a piece of every meat that they offered and none of it was anything I'd ever pay for. I honestly wouldn't even dine here for free next time. There are so many things wrong with this spot. The sides don't even look remotely fresh. They look like they've been sitting in the fridge for several days. They were all wilted and disgusting looking. The rice was hard and seemed like it was scooped into the bowl hours before we even got there. It was just hard, dry, and terrible. Arguably the worst bowl of rice I've ever had. Their salmon isn't that fresh. I guess it's hard to expect somewhat fresh fish at an AYCE KBBQ, but seriously just don't serve it at all if you aren't gonna get some decent stuff. I ate about a total of maybe 5 oz of meat or so and like 1/4th my bowl of rice before I threw in the towel.   Other things I found strange that I wasn't used to. They never change their grill. You cook your meal throughout on the same grill and it forms that nasty ass carcinogenic crust that is just not only bad for your health, but also leaves disgusting residue on your meat as you cook it. CHANGE THE GRILL, GODDAMNN. Another thing with the grill is that it dips in about 10 inches deep and it's just harder to cook because you have to stand up to look over to see all the meat that you're cooking. Also the grill is poorly designed in that you can actually burn your fingers while trying to cook because the flames come through. Never had this issue in Los Angeles.   I seriously hope this isn't the standard for KBBQ spots in Ontario. That would be really really sad. I'd be on the verge of tears for you guys if it actually was the standard. If I had one positive thing to say about Korea Grill House, it would be that the decor is nice. If you have no standards at all for food quality and don't mind paying good money for it, by all means make your way over. It also helps to enjoy the meal if you don't care about getting cancer."}
{"text":"I went for to lunch in this place with a couple of friends and it was pretty good! We got the $13.99 all you can eat meal, which gave us a variety of options to the different types of meat we can grill.   All of the food was nicely marinated, however I only gave this place a 3 star rating is because of the slow service. I went on a Monday and at lunch time practically whole restaurant was packed but there was only 3 people that seem to be working so when we asked for something it took quite some time to get to our table. But other than that I would recommend this Korean grill place."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I am surprised at the low rating on Yelp because after eating here, not only was the food abundant and delicious, the service was extremely on point and best of all, the price was absolutely reasonable. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been to many KBBQ places and this one just struck me as average. I went here with a couple of friends for lunch and they thought the same thing. The food was good but I've had better KBBQ. The service was alright, probably because there were only about 15 people in the restaurant at the time.   Overall, you'll be paying a reasonable price for reasonable food and reasonable service. Very few complaints but this place is pretty average."}
{"text":"I went there recently with my husband and his parents. We all ordered the beef bulgoki to cook at the table.  While the meat was all right the experience is definitely not authentic.  The accompanying dishes were pretty sad looking, wilty and stale. The kimchee was some of the worst I've ever had and I eat Korean food quite a bit.  The rice was not the short grain Japanese style that it should have been.  They provided a dipping sauce for the meat which seemed to be a soy based thin sauce which is not the correct accompaniment but what do you want for $9.95?  If they'd offered leaf lettuce leaves and kochu jang to wrap up the meat...  Anyhow, with the lousy service you had to flag down I just found this place to be very low quality.  I'd rather go to Koreantown and order a la carte or spend a bit more for real Korean barbeque.  Despite all this my in laws enjoyed the experience and expressed that they would go there again."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at a Korean BBQ place so I don't have anything to compare with, but I loved the experience.   Korean grill house is located in Richmond hill. Finding parking took a while.. It's definitely located in a busy plaza. We waited (2 ppl) for approximately 25 mins on a Saturday night.   Once we were seated and ready to order, our raw meat arrived fairly quickly.  There was a large variety of meats and they were all  well marinated. The sides were not as appetizing. The rice was super dry and the veggies looked wilted.  It is apparently one of the cheaper all you can eat Korean BBQ spots.   The ambiance was very loud, but seemed as of everyone was having a good time. I would not take a first date there because it is really hard to hold a conversation over all the noise. Lastly the service was mediocre.. Nothing special as they were super busy ."}
{"text":"Avoid this place like the plague.  1. Water has STRONG chlorine taste. 2. Lemon tea with honey has STRONG detergent taste. 3. Beef soup smells rotten. Don't ask me how it tastes because I'd never put that in my mouth. 4. Beef liver and beef slices are way too big to cook well and eat comfortably. Very sloppy processing. 2. Fish and meats come in a watery mess. 3. Grill becomes COVERED in burnt meat 8 mins in. Never changed. Black ashes cover all later meats. Can you say cancer? 4. Kimchi looks wrinkly. It was frozen or old or most likely both. 5. No one ever switches out your dirty black ash covered plate for new one. You get the point. I'm tired of typing...for this price 23 on week day per person (only 9 bbq meat options) + beverage $. You can do way better."}
{"text":"Decent , no frills place for Korean BBQ. The waiters are swift service wise but neglected changing the base for the grill. Limited but solid selection of protein and banchan."}
{"text":"Dropped in for an early dinner this past long weekend. We bypassed the lunch rush which was promising, however we were sat in the corner of the restaurant in a cramped table even though it was fairly slow.   Food was standard for the chain, I've visited other locations in Toronto and quality has remained consistent which is nice to see with franchises.  The service left a bit to be desired, we ordered a large Sapporo which after several minutes we had to order again before receiving it well into our meal.   In an effort to balance out the copious amounts of meat we were planning on eating, we opted to order the veggie add on. It was not worth the extra 3 dollars each. For two of us we got two VERY thinly sliced rounds of green pepper, a handful of halved mushrooms, a couple large leaves of romaine lettuce, sliced white onion, and a few pineapples. Yes, this is also AYCE, however it would have been nice to have chunks of peppers so they could grill nicely.   Aside from the slow service and underwhelming veggies, the meal was great and obviously filling."}
{"text":"These guys don't know what they're doing.  No comparison in any way to LA or real authentic Korean BBQ.  Bi Bim Bap with non of the veggies that go into REAL BBB.  WTF!!! No sesame oil?  Service needs work too.  These guys are lucky they're not competing with people who know how to make real Korean food."}
{"text":"Three friends and I dropped by here for lunch today. We all shared the all-you-can-eat meat portion (I'm not sure what it's called, but it was the first thing on the menu). The rice was perfectly cooked, and the meat was of superb quality. The servers were quick to bring everything over and offer refills, too. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The Korean Grill House is pretty standard and self explanatory.  You buy some raw meat and cook it yourself on the grill (a bowl shaped grill that is built into the table) and when you think it's done, you pull it off the grill and eat it.  Hopefully your food isn't undercooked.  Hopefully your chicken isn't undercooked.  The place is nice, and while I know tons of people who love the Korean Grill House, the idea of going out so that I can cook my own food is just something that has never appealed to me.  However, on that rare occasion when I'm in the mood for something like that, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We took the all you can eat option at lunch and did not disappoint. Novelty of cooking yourself quickly wore off. Fill out order sheets and raw meats, rice and veggies come soon afterwards. Empty plates and grills are swapped out on a regular basis."}
{"text":"We booked a reservation for 11 ppl and it came out 2 tables and 2 grills. Very crowded.  I like Korean food very much, and used to travel to Korean three times. Their side dishes were not good, no Koeran tastes, very Chinese.  All you can eat BBQ there is a very good deal, and it's better to go there in a group of 4 + 4 people, or 2 ppl, so you will have more space when you eat. Service was good and fast, those staff just worked like a robot, no smiles. A pitcher of beer there is 19 dollars, very expensive.  If they offer better bbq dip sauce/ paste and Romaine lettuce / lettuce will be great. The proper way to eat Korean bbq is to put meat in the lettuce and add some sauce / paste, then roll.  Good for a big group of ppl to get together. Most restaurants in Korean town are too small, that's why we choose to go Korean Grill House. By the way, the owner of Korean Grill House is Chinese, that's why their BBQ is not very Korean at all."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! BUT- if you're expectations are high when it comes to service, this is not the place for you. The waiters SUCK, all of them, all the time, but it's something that you learn to ignore after a while. You have to repeatedly ask them to bring you more water, and when you order more items you have to remind them a few times that they've forgotten to bring the items out. Been there at least 10 times and they never fail at sucking in service. Two thumbs down boys. They must not get enough tips or something. People!!, please tip them so they can give us better service. So my suggestion is- don't go there if you're having a bad day or if you're starving, but definitely go there if you want to pig out on some really good Korean BBQ grill."}
{"text":"service is much appreciated. the marinated sauce for the meat are quite salty, need a bit of asjustment.  overall, i would come back if im visiting Toronto again"}
{"text":"I've been to Korean BBQ places before, both here and in Asia.  For Canada, this is the first AYCE Korean BBQ I've experienced.  Going full out is your best bet.  The full AYCE is about $17.  They start by bringing you the \"tapas\" like kimchee, daikon and the other treats.  This is followed by an assortment of meats to start, all well marinated, tender and full of flavour.  You can then re-up by checking off boxes on the little order pad.  Don't stop until you hurt.  The secret here, of course, is to make you subsequent selections your personal favourites.  On the second order, I added fish to the mix.  The calamari was super fresh and tender, the salmon and tilapia were ok, but a little to fragile for grilling.  I went back to the meats for the 3rd and 4th round, focussing on the ribeye, pork, and chicken.  Drive into the parking lot and you get hit with the smoky aroma coming from the cooking tables.  It will get you every time."}
{"text":"Meh.  I thought the meat dishes were not marinated well and the side dishes were far below average. The meat was marinated in a way such that it was more salty than flavorful.   The grill was too low on the table for me. I had trouble seeing some of the food that was being cooked.   Service was fine. They refilled our drinks without us asking, cleared dishes away often, and food came fast after we ordered.   I found that the place is quite pricy for what you get. The cheapest all you can eat dinner option on Fridays and weekends is $20 and I thought the selection for this option was quite limited. You can get shrimp and lamb for $2 more and veggies is $3 more.  Note: They don't accept debit here."}
{"text":"This is place is just A-OK for the first 5-10 minutes of grilling...then it goes downhill. I find this place to be a little stingy with their meat portions. You only get so much and if you are with a group of friends it may not work out that well. I find that only certain parts of the grill really do work and the rest takes forever to cook. The worst part about this place is after cooking for awhile, the burner begins to burn and giving your fresh meat an awful taste. Most of the time I find people ask to have their burners changed but this can be time consuming.   It is a great experience and something new to try out in the city however after awhile the food quality just isn't that great, the portions aren't the best and everything is just average."}
{"text":"3.5 **  It's been awhile since I've gone for Korean BBQ AYCE. Lunch AYCE is $8.99 (pork, beef, chicken, fish, and squid) or you can opt for al la carte which starts at $4.99.   There is also the night owl option: after 10:00pm for $8.99 as well.  So going for lunch AYCE, the restaurant was packed. Service was prompt and quick, despite it being a full house.   My favourite side dishes were the kimchi and radishes. You can always order more when it's empty!  The meat: As mentioned and where my rating lost several stars, the meat were thinly sliced, losing most of it's moisture and flavour after cooking.   I enjoyed the chicken, though there was a lot of fat still on it.  For the price, I can't argue that you get the value for the money. If you're craving for some Korean BBQ for a good value, this place is recommended."}
{"text":"We usually go here atleast once per visit to Toronto. Always order off the All You Can Eat menu, which consists of Pork,Beef,Chicken,Beef Ribs,Ox Tongue,Ox Liver,Salmon,Squid,Fish Fillet, and/or Lamb & Shrimp. We'll usually pass on the Ox & Squid.. Depends on who were with and how were feeling I guess.. lol. Im in love with the Beef & Beef Ribs, soooo delicious.. the Pork & Chicken are good as well.. ..  Not too pricey i'd say.. its 14-16$ for the all you can eat menu for dinner, and 9$ for lunch... They also have prices for children. Staff is nice, but sometimes don't pass by your table as often as you'd want/need them to. If it'll be your first time going, then keep in mind that you can ask them to change your grill whenever & however often you want! So if you see your grill is dirty don't hesitate to ask! It will effect the taste of your food!!"}
{"text":"I have not been here in a few years ... but I'm so glad it is still around. I love this place.  The vent system at this place it very good so it is not Smokey like other Korean BBQ restaurants.  A great place to sit back ... grill some meat ... enjoy a cold beer with your friends and family.  I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"FOOD IS VERY SALTY AND OILY. THE FOOD SELECTION FOR AYCE IS LIMITED. THE SERVICE IS EVEN WORSE. I give it one star because there is no 0 star option on Yelp. I had my worst restaurant dining experience here. One of the waiters is so RUDE. I came to the restaurant with a unfinished bubble tea. He came to me and told me \"We don't allow outside drink\"in a very rude tone. I said okay and he threatened\" If I see you drink it, I will put your drink in our fridge\". I am very unhappy about his words. I am a customer at your restaurant, I pay for all of my food, drink and service, you shouldn't be talking to me like this. You should know the basic manner and show the basic respect. While having my dinner, my drink got disappeared, he took it away without me even noticing. What's the difference between his behaviour and stealing? I got very upset and asked for the restaurant manager, he seemed very happy seeing me upset and replied me back \"the manager is in HongKong\". WTF... It turned out that he is the manager of the store so I didn't get any apology or explanation from the restaurant. I don't feel I got treated and serviced with respect. And my personal belongs is not safe in the restaurant. My customer rights got violated. I would never come to this restaurant ever again"}
{"text":"It's an okay place - came here for dinner and ordered the cheapest AYCE ($18.99). What sucks is that if you want to grill veggies, its like an extra $2, so obviously I opted out and just stuck it out with the meat. I've been here a few times and the first few times, the grilled food had a hint of gasoline flavor... yum.. But I decided to try it again, and fortunately, the food was fine. Chicken is always the hardest to grill due to the thick pieces and not wanting to risk eating raw chicken. Fish can also be difficult as well since the cooked fish tends to stick onto the grill. Side dishes don't taste that great here either, especially the bean sprouts.  Service is a little slow and could improve abit. I don't like how they don't change up the grill when theres alot of burnt pieces stuck to the grill. Half way through our meal, the meat started to have that carcinogen burnt taste to it. There's better korean grill places for around the same price point."}
{"text":"The other location on Queen street is better. All of the meat here has an odd taste... it tasted like the gas from the grill. It was so unappetizing! Even though its the same restaurant, the banchan, meats, and even rice tasted better at the other location. Service is great here though, no issues here. This time the $17 wasn't worth it. If you have to come to this location, go after 10pm for the owl night special."}
{"text":"Think of this as your Asian Chaurascarria anytime you come to Korean Grill House (KGH).  I've actually been to this location a few times, and I must say it doesn't disappoint me. After all you can't really complain about the cooking.............since you're cooking it yourself lol!!!! (which my grandpa thinks is blausphemy)   Long story short the place is up to standards, the noise level is average, the wait staff are friendly and most of all efficient!  However the only draw back is that the tables are close to one another, so at times its easy to eavsdrop.  Dinner can range from $14+ per person which includes all of their meats on the menu, one advise.....condition yourself as your eyes can get bigger than your stomach :)"}
{"text":"The last time I came to this location was a few years ago, since then they've upgraded their interior decor and menu. Honestly! I'm not the biggest AYCE Korean BBQ, after all, how much meats can one person eat?  However with that being said,  the place is clean, presentable,  service is friendly,  and the service is efficient.  By the time we came there was plenty of seating since we beat out the dinner crowd before they started coming in. Prices can vary depending what time you arrive. After 10 pm they have a midnight menu priced at approximately $11.99 however we stuck to their usual AYCE menu for $17.99.  Overall the place is OKAY, since I'm not a big fan of eating so much meat.. it's AYCE. ..lol.."}
{"text":"Came here a little past 11am for an earlier lunch and we were surprised to find it still fairly empty.  Service was rather poor, it took them almost 10 minutes to get our rack changed in the middle of our meal.  Definitely get it changed, because it starts to get custy and black bits accumulate all over it!  In terms of food, as you would expect, not the nicest cuts of meat. The fish tends to get burnt, and it's definitely one of the hardest ones to cook. It was a fairly competitive price for a kbbq though (around $10), although not the best food/atmosphere.  Overall, a decent meal/experience. Think I'll try out some different kbbq's though."}
{"text":"Great place for Korean (cook it yourself) barbecue at very reasonable prices. Has an authentic Asian look and feel without trying to hard to be some sort of trendy place. The food is good and fresh with a variety of items to select."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of experiencing this place last summer when I lived in Toronto.  The hubs would come to visit every weekend and we would cruise the town looking for places to eat that we can't get back in Michigan.  We both loved Korean Grill House.  There are multiple locations, and we went to the one at Yonge & Bloor.   It's a clean, cozy little joint that slaps you in the face the minute you walk in with it's yummy teriyaki smell.    I had no idea what I was doing but the server was very friendly and helpful, and showed me how to use the little grill at our table.   Of course you need to get the all-you-can eat options because if you don't eat yourself sick, you haven't really lived.    They provides a wide selection of meat and vegetables that you can grill.  I stuck with the steak, chicken, pork, and lamb because the seafood stuff looked weird.  The shrimp kept staring at me and it gave me the creeps.  Everything tasted fabulous and it was fun to prepare your own stuff.   The hubs kept slapping my hand away from the grill as he felt the need to maintain his grilling master status.   Our server would clear our empty food dishes, and replace them with more slabs for us to throw on the grill.   The server was incredibly quick and efficient with our refills on both drinks and food.    I had never eaten at a place like that before so it was a fun, unique experience.   I would have given 5 stars but I had to take one away because of that darn shrimp who's eyes still haunt me."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever! I remember it was around during my high school years, that's almost 20 years ago for me!  Next door was a place called LoveGetty Station where teeny boppers would gather to take sticker and card pictures! How time flies!  Anyway, out of all the AYCE \"KBBQ\" places along highway 7, this place is definitely slightly on the lower end in pricing but higher on in service when compared to say Chako down the road.  They recently had rennovations and Korean Grill House has been tremendously updated its decor.  This place was once grungy and gritty, especially the washrooms. I'm happy to say even the washrooms got an upgrade with a more sleeker, cleaner look!  The food is better now as well as they are finally using higher quality cuts of beef, pork and leaner chicken!  The appetizer dishes haven't changed, they are still as delicious as they were years ago.  The marinade they use for the meats can be quite salty, so be prepared to drink a lot of water or pop that they offer.  They also have a full functioning bar offering cocktails, beer and wine whereas in the years before, I believe it was only beer and wine.   What impressed me the most on my recent visit is that now built into the grills, are fans that immediately suck the smoke from the grills below - meaning that you no longer have to smell disgusting after eating here!  Hooray! It's only taken this long for it to be implemented but I am so glad it's finally here.  This alone will entice me to return over the other \"KBBQ\" places in Richmond Hill/Markham.  They still have the late night menu that's cheaper than the regular menu ($12.99 vs. $16.99), effective after 10pm.  Just no short ribs though, the late night menu is pork, squid, beef, chicken and tilapia fish.  Grill on friends!"}
{"text":"I used to like hitting up Korean barbecue for it's late night special I believe it's about 10.99  The bothersome part about these guys is that they only take cash. It gets really annoying and it deters me from going there quite often because I don't carry cash  Prior to their renovation I saw a rat on one of the tables. No word of a lie. A rat. Before I could blink it was gone and Asian man from the kitchen had a pitcher of hot water chasing something down the side of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Korean grill house. Can't ever go wrong with their expanded menu and extra bamboo sprouts and bean sprouts. Service sometimes is slow but the food is delicious and fun to make."}
{"text":"I really like this location better than the other locations. There's always a table open for me and my friends and it's never too crowded or loud. During the lunch menu there isn't any beef short ribs which was kindof a let down because my friends and I really only like the sliced beef, short ribs and chicken. My advice is to just skip seafood all together, it's not worth the pain. In general seafood at kbbq is never that great and usually falls apart or doesn't taste that great so unless you're a big seafood lover you can do without it. As for side dishes, the kimchi is always on point and so are the radishes and sliced potatoes. Depending on what day during the week you go, sometimes you'll find the portions are a lot smaller than usual. The first time I went they had pretty big cuts of meat but the last time I went the cuts were very small and thin but that's not an issue since it's AYCE you can just order more. PSA if you're paying with debit they charge you like $2 more so if you're ballin on a budget bring some cash!! Definitely recommend this place if you want some good kbbq"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here during lunch for the AYCE kbbq. It was about $20 a person which is pretty standard for AYCE bbq so don't let the $$ rating of this restaurant scare you. In comparison to a lot of the korean bbq restaurants at korea town I definitely felt like this place had better meat then the rest. The short ribs and beef were our favourite meats. The fish was came apart pretty quickly and the chicken took a really long time to cook (but this is all typical when it comes to kbbq) so beware of that. My first complaint about this place is that they wouldn't accept debit card but they still took credit cards for some reason... I don't know if it was just because their machine was down for the day or what but it was very frustrating for me and my friends. However, my biggest complaint was the ordering process at this restaurant. The way it works is you fill out a form and state how many orders you want (ie 2x orders of ribs, 3x orders of kimchi, etc). We found that the kitchen often ignored our orders and gave us what they felt was best instead of what we wanted. Since we all really like kimchi we ordered 1 for each of us (5x kimchis total) but they only gave us 2 at a time! The same thing happened when we ordered other side dishes and sometimes with the meat too. I feel that if they aren't willing to give as much as the customers want, then they really shouldn't be offering an AYCE option because it gets frustrating."}
{"text":"On a trip to see friends, we stumbled upon Korean Grill House after karaoke-ing across the street. It' definitely one of the gems on Yonge. And even though it is not authentic Korean, it still is good food at an affordable price!"}
{"text":"Excellentes grillades, service rapide, produits frais. Le forfait all you can eat n'est pas cher et donne un bon aperçu"}
{"text":"Not real korean BBQ.  Owned by Chinese and the slices of meats are skimpy and paper thin.  If you want true Korean BBQ then ask a Korean and don't go by the name of the restuarant.  Garbage."}
{"text":"Not real korean BBQ.  Owned by Chinese and the slices of meats are skimpy and paper thin.  If you want true Korean BBQ then ask a Korean and don't go by the name of the restuarant.  Garbage."}
{"text":"It's your standard All-You-Can-Eat Korean BBQ, where obviously you cook the food yourself! Although you don't have to, but that's the main reason why I come to these retaurants, a fun time, good food and cheap! If you come after 10 or 11, I think the AYCE is around $11 so it's a decent price to fill you up late at night.  It's a great place to go with a group of friends and just socialize but again nothing exceptionally fancy about this place. I found their tables were a bit worn out (i.e. cracked and chipped) which I thought they would've fixed or replace by now but nope (not a biggy though).  Must have their spare ribs and beef, I love the marinade mmmmm . Makes me want to go their now haha.  If you're in the Queen street area and doing nothing after a long day of shopping and/or touristing and are super hungry then definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest Korean BBQ place but definitely the best for late nights. After 10 p.m. you can get their late night all you can eat menu for under $10! And unlimited drinks for a couple dollars more.  The place is usually half empty, service is pretty slow and the food isn't amazing but if you're coming back from a party or just have those late night grease cravings, head over here and get your fill for cheap."}
{"text":"I have returned to give this location a 2nd chance. Meat was flavourful and rather good cuts. We wanted for nothing, refilled sides and tea, brought meats out quickly. Service was prompt and professional. In the end the experience was a pleasant one."}
{"text":"Overall it's an interesting experience doing the Korean BBQ, always busy which means service isn't the best. Food was good it just takes a while to be cooking all your food and waiting for staff to come to get more. Good to experience with friends not so much alone."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto for the first time and I wanted to try out this place since several websites listed it as one of the best Korean BBQ.  By all mean this is not Korean BBQ but the price fits the budget for frugal traveling carnivore like me.  Meat quality is just ok, not the best quality I had elsewhere for the same price. I must say Toronto is expensive.  Parking is limited so I recommended to take the public transportation.  Location is great, right in the middle of downtown Toronto and a block away from the AGO.  The rest is just average. You can't expect the best from only 3 servers for a full restaurant"}
{"text":"Very mediocre. There's barely any service. The grill just go burnt and nobody offers to change them. The meat doesn't seem super fresh but they are OK. There's nothing Korean about it. The taste is ok."}
{"text":"The receptionist was horrible. This is the first time Ive seen a racist asian. Theres a long queue and she told me there will be a little wait then she decided to send me and my sister upstair without even asking if I want to wait or be seated upstair. There is no clear instruction where the upstair is. I have to go back and asks someone else. Then here we go. The upstairs is dark and dirty. The waiter approached us and directed us to a shared table. Its okay to share table but placing us in between 2 patron and when I asked how am I suppose to get in, the waiter said nothing and no one wants to stand up and let me in. We went downstairs and with our surprise the line is gone. Everyone else was seated inside downstairs. What a shame for an asian to be a racist in a foreign land."}
{"text":"Would've been 3.5 if it wasn't for the robotic customer service. No expressions at all and the servers would go to lengths to not make eye contact so you cannot call out to them."}
{"text":"Crap service, waiters are definitely high or something. They forgot so much stuff and just left it sitting on the counter. Waiter that couldnt pull his pants up managed to get mine wet by spilling water all over me and my phone. Never coming back here, overpriced for nothing but laundry service."}
{"text":"Great googly moogly that was a was a lot of meat!  I haven't been here in years, but it was just as good as the first time I went with my girl Esther Y and her now-hubby, my bestie.  The three of us went here on a whim because I had never been to a Korean Grill House.  Needless to say, being back in Toronto now for a quick weekend trip, I knew I wanted to go back and introduce it to my husband. His thoughts were the same as mine years ago: \"What?  They bring out a whole much of raw meat and I have to cook it MYSELF at the grill at the table?  What's the point of going to a restaurant then.\"  I will tell you: I wasn't buying it either at first, but then I experienced it and I totally got it.  The meat was buttery soft and because you are eating it moments after it gets off the grill, the taste is amazing.  On top of that, it is seasoned to perfection.   Like many ethnic restaurants (Ethiopian spots included... not letting my people slide on this one), the service was not the best.  I mean, it's passable, but no one goes out of there their way to be friendly, just efficient.  It's like you are visiting a close friend or relative's house to eat and you come by all the time.  There's not going to be a red carpet laid out when you practically live there.  That's the way the staff treats folks who come here whether they are regulars or not.  Still, with food this good, I will let is pass and give the coveted 5 stars.  Great if you are starving, in for an experience, or trying to impress a date.  $8.99 for all you can eat lunch and $14.99 for all you can eat dinners is NOT bad at all.  MELIKES!"}
{"text":"i come here once in a while but only because its cheap for late night food (night special $9.99 !!) on weekends w the bf if we can't decide where to go .   i hate coming here . its like the last place i grudgely agree to when i cant think of anywhere to eat around the area late at night . as a korean, i almost hate this place . there's nothing korean about it other than that you cook the food yourself at the table . NONE of the meat are korean marinated . theyre not even good ! i dont know if its just bad cuts of meat or bad marinating but it can be sooo much better . i havent tried a lot of real korean bbqs in toronto but places like sariwon up in richmond hill are examples of REAL korean bbq . not this place . this place is FAR from being korean .   one star for food . another for the value & attentive service ."}
{"text":"Korean grill experience was great, and the service wasn't bad there fast but not very friendly every time we went there.  The food tasted great though. I reccomnd checking it out but expect the service to be just ok."}
{"text":"Delicious, what more is there to say about the food? I went there alone and didn't feel out of place, at all. It was easy to get the attention of the waiter and frying the food myself was fun. The first batch, the fire was high, but I'm not scared of a few flames. With out my asking, it was turned down on the second round and I found that it was very sweet of him to do. I also got a bottle of soju for myself and although I couldn't finish it, I didn't mind with all the delicious food in front of me. Thank you guys for making me feel at home!"}
{"text":"This is in no way, shape, or form Korean BBQ. Adding a plate of kimchi doesn't make it Korean any more so adding soy sauce on a burger makes it Chinese food. That said, what this is is a lot of meat + fire and some tasty rice for a great price. And there ain't nothing wrong with that. No sir."}
{"text":"$10 all you can eat meat cooked on fire? Korean Grill House's lunch menu provides about the best AYCE deal in Toronto. That it's available on weekends is worth an extra star.   Yes, it's not really Korean BBQ. But if you just look at it as lots of meat cooked on fire, is there a problem here?  They now seem to offer vegetable sides you can grill up for an extra $3 but, I mean, vegetables? Anti-meat? Are you serious?   Don't let the small main floor fool you. There's a much larger upstairs.  Service was quite good."}
{"text":"Great food, before coming here I was already a big fan of Korean BBQ. No complaints about the food.   The actual venue was old and upstairs was a bit run down so that was a downer. The staff were all very helpful and nice."}
{"text":"I went along with a friend on a Friday evening to this place. At first I was pretty excited because I've heard alot of hype about Korean-style grill places and having had the Chinese-style hot-pot/grill combinations in the past I thought maybe the grill experience wouldn't be that different albeit with a distinctly Korean flair thrown in. What could really go wrong, right...?? Well, it was certainly not a thrilling experience... Service was somewhat nice with a friendly accommodating waiter who suggested which daiquiris were favorites among the customers. But that's where the experience seemed to end on a positive note... I have no idea what authentic, traditional Korean grill cuisine is back in the \"homeland\" but I certainly agree with reviews of the Korean yelpers on here who say that there is seemingly nothing authentic about this non-Korean operated eatery. The only feature worth getting all \"oohy/aahwy\" about the whole grilling experience is the gas contraption that is sunk in the middle of the table. Other than that, I really didn't see anything else worth raving about regarding this particular type of culinary experience. And the items for the all-you-can-eat seemed so limited, listed down on a square piece of paper that was 1/4 smaller than a playing card. AYCE at Japanese places, dim-sum and even hot pot places offer a bigger selection of items to choose from and I don't see why customers would have to pay extra to get raw vegetables. It would have been really great to wrap most of the grilled meat in large lettuce leaves with a few other raw veggies added in like I've seen being eaten on most Korean food shows. Now that would have been a worth-while experience. Presentation of the raw food seemed hap-hazard and bland and that's noticeable in some of the pictures from other yelpers, most of the items from the AYCE option we choose was mainly red or white in color. And there was only one kind of dipping sauce instead of a couple of selections to choose from to add more flavor to the cooked food. I really hope that the Korean-operated places offer a much better grilling experience than this place. Any suggestions...??"}
{"text":"Pretty happy, we were placed into a corner, where we could never get any service, because nobody saw us.  I swear the server probably forgot we were there, that's okay.  Food was good, pretty fast to come Service was good, (when we actually received service). All in all, I liked it."}
{"text":"We tried ayce Korean grill with out the lamb and seafood upgrade. At about $18.99 on a weekday, it's a pretty decent price and the service was very attentive. It wasn't too busy so I think that helped. They really kept track of refills and orders and helping us with the grill when it was too hot or too burnt.   The meats were alright. Sometimes the beef was discoloured so I would just get one at a time. We get a whole ton of beef short ribs. You have got to load up on those yummys!!  I also found the chicken to be a no fail. The cuts of chicken are nice and thick so you don't burn through it after a few seconds. :)   Really the service was amazing, again I'm guessing because it was a quiet night. I recall coming on a weekend not long ago and we had very little service haha so I guess it just depends on the night :)   Everything is reallllly salty by the way so make sure you drink a lot of water and take digestive enzymes!!"}
{"text":"RENOVATIONS CAN DO WONDERS  After weeks of searching for a new Korean BBQ place to eat, this one will always be number 1 to me and have me coming back for more.   The last time I was here the place was in definite need of a makeover, perhaps be like the rest of the KGH downtown. It was clean and all but it just looked old, with the bright lights, wooden walls, and bamboo. Made you feel like you were eating in a forest. Fast forward 2 months later and WOW! Definite modern contemporary look, with dark tones and just the right amount of lighting. It has a lot more appeal to it and is probably the best looking KGH in the GTA. I kinda felt under dress just because the place looked so much nicer than it was.   As for the food it's always great no matter what. Very well marinated and takes little time to cook. For those that don't know here's a little KGH 101.  So it is an AYCE BBQ with 4 different AYCE selections the first is the basic, chicken, pork, beef, white fish and squid for $9 but that's only during lunch or after 10pm.   The 2nd menu is all of the above but with beef ribs, ox tongue, ox liver, Korean sausage and salmon for $14.   The 3rd menu is all of the above plus shrimp and lamb for $17.   Lastly, for all those vegetarians it's $5 for AYCE veggies.    With the AYCE you get side dishes of beef soup, radish, kimchi, bean sprouts, spicy bean sprouts, tofu, and potatoes. All very good, but I must point out the kimchi is the BOMB, it destroys every other kimchi at any Korean restaurant. It's not sour like most places I've been to and has just the right amount of spice. Lastly with AYCE it's AYCD for $2 Pretty sweet deal I think.  For those that don't want AYCE, they do have a regular menu, which I still have to taste, and trust me I will. For those wondering what's on the a la carte menu, you get all the BBQ stuff, different types of soup, bibimbop and different types of fried rice.  Items to definitely get:  - Kalbi (Beef Ribs) - Kimchi - Chicken - the chicken has a curry taste to it, different but I like it - Bulgogi (Beef)"}
{"text":"We ended up in the restaurant beside the grill house. They still own it, but I think if you're doing a la cart, that's where they send you.   I ordered the Green Curry chicken. The service was great, the meal was yummy, can't complain. I wouldn't say it stands out in comparison to the other gazillion restaurants in the area, but it's worth the money you pay for. The green curry chicken was a it spicy. If you have a medium tolerance, this is just right.   I gave it a 4 because of the good service and the good food, but I'd probably only go back here again if I'm out late. It's basically not my first choice of restaurant, but I don't mind ending up here."}
{"text":"I've come here on several occasions now, and have had an equally fantastic experience each time.  This is probably my favourite all-you-can-eat joint in Toronto, next to Mandarin.  If I want an abundance and variety of many different foods I usually go to Mandarin.  If I'm feeling some thinly sliced Korean style beef and short-ribs though, this is where I'm going.  The service is typically quick, and you can be eating delicious appetizers and cooking your meats within minutes of sitting down at your table.  The quick service, coupled with the convenience of cooking and eating fresh meat right away makes this an all-you-can-eat experience that you must try at least once.  They serve a wide variety of meats such as beef slices and short-ribs (my favourite), chicken, salmon, pork, sausage, and for an extra price you can also get shrimp.  For the appetizers, you can expect rice, sprouts, spicy sprout salad, potato salad, glass noodles, and other tasty snacks that complement the meal perfectly.  They serve Japanese beers in tall cans; Sapporo is usually my go-to!  I took my Mom out for her birthday her with family, and we had a fantastic time.  I also love coming here with friends for drinks and dinner.  I'll most definitely be coming back very soon, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place has fucking shit service. I walked in and aged 7 years before I was seated....I missed my son's birth and my wedding. By the time I was seated, I learned 3 new languages. The individual who was serving me knew one word, yes. The one star rating is a place holder, it's should be shut down due to NO ONE WORKING HERE. Not to mention 11 people 2 grills oh baby.   overall a good experience 10/10   update: After cooking for a few minutes, the grill turned black. We asked for it to be changed, he said to wait 10 minutes....after 30 minutes he returned and said \"we out\" and reignited the black grill. He then filled our water with another tables left over water. I am not tipping this half ass service."}
{"text":"My friends and I had had been looking for a Korean BBQ place and happened upon this place. Luckily we got there early, cause within 15-20 min after there was a line out the door.  We all got the AYCE BBQ, and so glad we did. The staff was very helpful, despite all the reviews I read here. They were constantly filling our water and green tea, and walking by to see if we wanted to order more. And to top it off they were extremely pleasant which made out experience at this place even more worth it. We all enjoyed the grilling experience, and the food was delicious.  They don't rush you out of the place, we were almost there for three hours. It does get a little loud in the restaurant after a while."}
{"text":"I came here the other day with friends, the place is very nice and the price is reasonable. After 10 pm the price was 13 per person which is for all you can eat BBQ. They have many different type of mean. This includes chicken, beef,fish,squid , pork and more . they also give you some soup and salads . the place is nice it can fit many people per table we were 7 ppl and it fit us easily. The tables are too big but it would be nice to have two BBQ per table but they did not this make the bbqing job a bit more difficult and we had to wait longer. Chicken was my fav so order the chicken 4 sure. Finally one thing I was not a fan of it the waiting they made us so as we came at 9 45 and the deal for cheaper BBQ stars at 10 so they ask us to wait till like 9 58 to let us in. Over all will recommend this place after 10. The price to the quality of the food you get is very impressive."}
{"text":"Korean Grill House is a chain. And as some of the other reviews have mentioned, it's not really Korean. It's Korean-style BBQ. This particular branch has 2 stories. Most of the seating is on the 2nd floor. Wait staff is attentive and friendly.   The food is good. The all-you-can-eat dinner is $12.95 Canadian dollars. Comes with thinly-sliced beef, BBQ ribs, pork, salmon, and squid. Also comes with side dishes. The kimchi is good, but the rest are just OK.   Had the mango sticky rice for dessert, which was terrible. The mango was unripe, and the sauce was way too sour."}
{"text":"First day of spring! We were in downtown toronto and we decided to go to korean grill...So I am back to my favourite korean restaurant and I forever love the bbq!!! Unfortunately,  service here is slow and not that good compared to the other branches.."}
{"text":"Ah, Korean Grill House. So good, so far from real Korean food it's kind of funny. But hey, when you just want a smorgasbord of grilled meats and veggies, it's the place to go!  I've been to the Queen St location and the Yonge location, and both were good. The service at Queen St I find a bit better, but both are good. I like the set up at Queen St better as it's more open and you can see the street, but neither one is bad.  The All You Can Eat option is the way to go, without a doubt! The ribs, sausage, and more ribs are the best of the meats. Chicken is good, but takes too long to cook. Beef is also good when doused in the soy sauce seasoning. Arrives with a bunch of small side dishes which are tasty as well. The potatoes are one of the better options as is the tofu. After a few rounds (and that's probably where you should stop anyhow), it's time to change the grill as it gets pretty charred. Staff take care of this on the spot.  One of the things I like better about KGH is the fact that unlike other AYCE places, they don't stop bringing you food until you tell them to. For me, that's a huge bonus as it always irks me when you're wanting one more plate and they wait until it's too late.The price is also a plus. Not too bad for a dinner of good food. Important to keep the bowls of white rice on the table as the shear volume of grease you have on the go will make it the only thing between you and an inevitable coronary.  Soda is unlimited refills and beer is a good price.  Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"$23 per person for all you can eat beef, beef short ribs, pork, chicken, pork sausage (the asian kind with the orange coating), salmon, fish fillet. Rice, kimchi, bean sprouts, radish, potato, small dried tofu side dishes are included.  If you want veggies, it's an additional $3.  Note that there's automatic 13% gratituity charge, regardless of party size. They tell you about it when they bring you the bill.  The taste/marinade used for all the meats is the same. The kimchi and bean sprouts are basically the same flavour too. Very sweet and salty.  The service is decent, and the only reason they get 3 stars instead of 2. They fill your water pretty often without needing to ask, and change your grill pretty quickly once you flag them down.  It's also a Chinese run \"Korean BBQ\", not Korean... if that matters to you."}
{"text":"We were walking down Yonge St and saw this restaurant. This restaurant looks very small until you walk upstairs and see an additional 50 tables or so.  This place was packed, but we got seated quick.  We ordered the all you can eat for $18 or so.  At first the service was good and food came fast, but as the meal went on service suffered greatly and at times we had to refills our own water glasses and RICE, Yes I said RICE was hard to come by.  The value was good, the food tasted good, but overall the service was very poor.  This place would have been 5 stars if the service was just 50% percent better."}
{"text":"Can you say all you can eat Korean BBQ for $12.99 after 10 pm...  I know crazy right!  It was delicious.  Food is great, depends on how you cook it of course.  The marinade is good.  When you sit down make sure you place your order for a crap ton of meat and sides also ask for a pitcher of water.  I gave it 3 stars because I had to repeatedly ask for things.  After awhile one of the servers realized the other server wasn't getting us anything we asked and became our server then it got better."}
{"text":"This place is just great, down in the States these places are a bit harder to find, and if you do manage to find one, they rarely let you cook yourself, which is half of the fun.    I love that they bring the meat uncooked to the table, you can always tell it is high quality and nothing can be hidden in the cooking of the product, just as fresh as can be.  Prices are incredibly cheap and this place is amazing for larger groups, I think we showed up with 9 people.  We were able to get a reservation for that amount which is nice since the place was packed on a Thursday night.  Service was actually really great as well, our server was quick to refill drinks as well as to replenish our meat supplies.    Just a fantastic experience for our group all around, one word of advice, everyone should get the all you can eat, or like in our case, a couple people end up spending the last hour watching the rest of the party still eating and cooking away.  Too bad for them I guess."}
{"text":"This is the second best location downtown for the 'Korean Grill House'. It's definitely friendly, and more sociable than the Yonge and Gerrard location, but it falls behind the best version, at Yonge and Bloor where the food comes faster, and you are not pushed out when it's Saturday night and the crowds are building up, while you enjoy you 'all you can eat'.  It's still a hoot to eat at the Korean Grill House, and it's a conveinent location on Queen St, right off the 501 Streetcar, and near Osgoode Subway station."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a meat galore, here you have it. OK service. Marinade is meh... Banchan is meh.   The only thing that really bothered me about this whole place was the seating. For tables of 6 is was like. Low booth style. So you'd have to sit in a bench. This is just so inconvenient for when one person has to use the washroom. Additionally, there was only 1 grill for 6 people to use! I have been to other Korean Grill House locations and it was always 2 grills for the 6 of us, sometimes even 3.   I probably would not come back here--definitely won't suggest and won't recommend but if I'm invited to a place and it happens to be this one--I'll tolerate it because I don't hate it but I don't like it either."}
{"text":"This is a properly average Korean BBQ house.  What is the fascination with this food style..I always feel like I'm paying a lot to cook the food myself ;)  The FOOD:  They decent a decent, but small assortment of ban chan (not my favorite kimchee).  The Korean BBQ is unlimited, if that's your thing, but I wouldn't call any of the meat either low of high quality--firmly average.  The beer and pork were my favorites...I can definitely pass on the liver.  There is sadly very little in the way of veggies or sides....it's an all-meat affair.  The grill can get a little gross as well.  The SERVICE:  Well, there's not too much service needed with Korean BBQ.  They were nice enough, perfunctory and replaced the empty trays rather quickly.    The VIBE:  It's kind of odd, every day folk mixed with asian girls in ridiculously high heels...do you really take someone here for fancy date night, folks?  I found their ventilation system to be not so great, so the smoke really builds up after a while...you'll smell like grilled meat afterwards.  OVERALL, nothing compels me to return, but I wouldn't refuse going with someone there either."}
{"text":"Been here twice. The staff are really nice. Lunch special is the bomb! Sadly, I went vegetarian so no more KBBQ for me. Anyways...I love this place. Oh don't order the fish to grill...it was such a pain to get out..almost burnt it"}
{"text":"Im writing this with a little prejudice because I had a credit card scam perpetuated on me that I believe came from this restaurant on Queen Street.    To get the food and restaurant out of the way. It was a fun place. I was in TO from NY for a few days with work colleagues and on a whim we stopped in.  While I wouldnt call it really authentic Korean, the food and grill your own meats and fish was fresh, tasted good, and it was fun to do.  All in all a fun night out...until. I recieved my credit card bill two weeks later. Low and behold there were about 8 charges over the next two weeks for gas, movies, cigarattes, and a nice meal.  I still had my card so obviously my card was duplicated which is a common scam now.   I know it came as a result of this restaurant because I was only in TO 2 days, i only used my card once and this was the only time the card left my sight.  I am not being accusatory, Im just being realtistic about what happened.  My credit card company handled it, and its not like my identity was stolen, but it is a scam and a common one where the person takes the card , runs it in a device that records the magnetic strip, and then duplicates the card.    Moral of the story, dont let the card leave your eyes in any store or restaurant."}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant a few times over the last few years. Came here on a week day lunch with some colleagues. Lunch special from 7.99-11.99. I got the kabi (short ribs). It was really good. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"This location was my introduction to Korean BBQ many years ago. Since then, a lot of other BBQ places have popped up and I haven't been here in years but I chose this place to introduce another friend to this cuisine and style of eating.  I guess they've done a little upgrade here and there since my last visit. It looks better than I remember.  We ordered the basic all-you-can-eat BBQ with shortribs, beef, pork, chicken, sausage, squid, salmon, and fish. It included the standard side dishes, rice, and soup, all for 18.99. Veggies would have been an extra 3.00. Shrimps and lamb would have increased the price by another  3.00. Ordering all of that would add up to just as much or more than I pay at similar restaurants that include everything, and more.  After explaining to my friend how everything works, we started grilling. The grill is recessed deeper than most places I've been to but the ventilation works very well. The meats were fresh and seasoned properly. The salmon, quite honestly, was cut very thin and seemed almost like secondary (scrap) cuts. I don't think the squid was very fresh either. Nor were the side dishes.   I've been eating a lot of Korean food lately and I usually enjoy the side dishes but these didn't seem very fresh. The bean sprouts were wilted and the rest of the dishes looked like they've been sitting in a fridge for a while.  While it was a decent value for what we paid, there are better Korean BBQ restaurants around now, many within a 10-minute drive. I'll probably choose one of the other places next time."}
{"text":"I've been to KGH about 5 times.  This time will probably be my last.  #1. the service was bad.  They were very pleasant.....to each other.  To the customers, annoyed, indifferent, brusque.  When they brought the meats, the raw liquid was dripping down the sides of the dishes or they caused the liquid to splash onto the table.  No apologies, no clean up.  I said to my husband very sarcastically, \"they are SOOOOO friendly here, almost like they want our business\".  #2.  The food, was fine but for the rice which you can tell was in the bowls waiting for a long time because the tops were crusty.  Lots of refills.  I really like the kimchi.  #3 cooktop is ridiculously low to the point where you have to stand up to see what's in there.  Could be why their place is relatively smoke free but you spend your time popping up and down like a groundhog.  Tongs are short, with a deep set cooktop, short tongs and flare ups, be careful you don't burn yourselves.  #4. decor is nice and bright, sort of greasy which you can expect given that it's a bbq place.  #5. the menu is varied, you don't have to get bbq, they have a good selection of other dishes.  But, if you do get bbq, everyone at the table has to get it and get the same package."}
{"text":"I like korean bbq but the service here is TERRIBLE.  I'm not sure if someone called in sick that day (Thursday April 17 to be exact) but there were hardly enough wait staff to service the lunch crowd.  My colleague and I did the AYCE and even though we were ready to order more, no one came and we couldn't do a second round LOL.  Plus they even forgot to give us our soup in the beginning.   Overall, not a great location to visit.  I like the Korean Grill House on Queen Street much better."}
{"text":"This place is good for all your kbbq cravings. I'm a pescatarian so I only eat the salmon, fish fillet, squid, and tofu (don't judge me, I only come here because I don't want to burden my friends with having to choose a place that caters to my pescatarian needs) but they are all great, tofu especially. Also, the service is amazing. One guy in particular that helped us out was really funny and friendly, made us very comfortable. A great spot."}
{"text":"All I know is if this place was near my house, it would be a weekly occurrence for me.  Korean BBQ is a great meal for a group of hungry people. Nothing says community like cooking raw meats together over a grill built right into the table! You can tell its a communal thing as the noise level is above average, but thats just because everyone is having fun.  This is not my first time at Korean BBQ, but Korean Grill House added a few extra things that has put it above the rest in my KBBQ experiences. The chicken was actually flavoured very well, along with the pork. The beef was good, but a tad salty, but combined with fresh lettuce and rice, really breaks up the saltiness (and monotony of meat)  Items of interest were the salmon fillets, which grill up nicely, and ox tongue and liver (tried the tongue, not the liver). We purchased the regular all you can eat (about $16), and the veg option ($3) - decided to pass on the shrimp and lamb option (about $18, includes everything from the $16 option).  Wait staff was very friendly and quick to respond, and would replace your grill top upon request (which is essential after an hour of eating). The best part of all, no charge for any leftovers! For an AYCE place that also does a la carte, this was a big surprise (a much welcomed one as well).  One last tip, bring friends, lots of friends, for a good time and good food."}
{"text":"Great place hidden behind the plaza on Hwy 7. Clean place, amazing service and yummy food. Went with a big group of apprx 16 guys. It was all about meat, meat and lots of meat.  Will definitely be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"This restaurant appears clean (I didn't see the kitchen or use the washrooms) and it is nicely decorated. It is mostly open concept and pretty loud with all of the sizzling meat. The chairs are padded which makes them comfortable, but you can't pull in close to the table because the gas unit under the table takes away all leg room. I really have no idea how they can get away with the serious burn-risk temperature units that are located right under the cooking grill that nearly burned my knee. I mean the metal panel is scorching hot and clearly dangerous, but the place was full of people, including lots of children. The food was pretty good and they offer a good variety for the price of the all-you-can-eat menu. Their water glasses are plastic and really small but there isn't a whole lot of room on the tables anyway. The service was quick and friendly and probably the best part of the meal. I went with a group (somebody else chose the location) but I wouldn't go back because I didn't enjoy having to worry about burning my legs while trying to eat, and also smelling like BBQ afterwards."}
{"text":"@KGHMadeInChina #KOREANGRILL #YELPTO #MEATSWEATS #BBQ  If you know me at all, you know I am usually a huge fan of Korean Grill. Yet, I don't get people who diss the Yonge-Dundas location. To me, it's far better than this location (Bloor & Yonge) and even the Queen St location. My advice to all - travel an extra mile or few to go to the Yonge-Dundas location.   Although cleaner, and the decor is possibly nicer than the other locations, here are some of my dislikes pertaining to this location below:   1. The grills are flat, unlike the upward cone grill at the Y&D location. For a shorty like myself, that cone makes a lot of sense. Plus I find a more \"team aspect\" to the upward cone grilling - everyone around the table is able to participate, no matter how far you're away from the grill. With the flat grill, we almost had to half-stand and look over another's shoulder.   2. The pork and beef cuts are way too thin and way too little. I am not gaga about the marinade either.   A quick rundown of all the meats tried:   - BEEF: each plate came with 3 thin slices. I am usually a fan of the beef. Wasn't so much here.  - PORK: runner up to the winner meat.  - CHICKEN: good. This is probably the most unified marinated meat across the three locations. It's never tasted different.   - BEEF RIBS: best!!!!! winner meat!!  - SAUSAGE: pass.   - OX LIVER: I was hoping to like it more than I did. I am a huge liver fan... but I ended up overcooking every time I tried. I have to go back with the KG experts.   - SALMON: okay. I am usually a salmon fan, but at KG, I'd rather indulge in meat meat.   - SQUID: okay.  - FISH FILLET: okay, cooks to a crumbly mess.    ANKIE TIP: It's been said before, but go to the Y&D location if you truly want to enjoy Korean Grilling."}
{"text":"I love this place and the place next to it. A lot of my friends complain about bad service, but I have never had a single bad experience (AND I've been here a lot). I prefer this location to the one on Queen Street simply because it's cleaner and more upscale in appearance.   Details:  Ambience: Dimly lit, clean stainless steel everywhere, nice, cozy, warm - there's nothing you won't like about the ambience. Although it is located very close to Zanzibar and the sex shops...   Crowd: Mixed crowd. A lot of Ryerson students and business professionals during lunch. Throngs of friends during dinner. I've also seen dates. Infact, I love going here with my boyfriend.   Variety: I don't really care about variety at KGH because I go for the beef, pork and chicken and all three come yummily marinated. And the rice. And their diluted version soy sauce for the rice. There are other options - squid, fish, salmon, ox tongue, etc.  Verdict? It's $9.99 for AYCE lunch. You get to cook it and have fun. And it's a meat lover's paradise. This is a STEAL. Take my word for it."}
{"text":"This review is about the a la carte orders only.  For those who are interested in AYCE, this is not relevant.  If there is something to be called a Canadian Korean or American Korean food, this would be it.  I had a Korean Stir Fry noodle ($10).  It looked bad: oily, so dark in colour that it seemed burnt, which was probably due to using too much low quality Korean chilli paste.  The taste was flat, which was probably because the chef thought no additional flavouring was needed after dumping so much chilli paste in.  But the chilli paste wasn't that spicy.  It didn't numb my taste bud, meaning I could tell the dish was lack of other flavours.  The noodle was too soft.  There was supposed to have beef, chicken and squid meat in there.  The squid was tough.  The beef was okay.  The chicken... what chicken?  Really, I could cook better.  Strongly recommend you to pass this item.  Ordering the AYCE raw meat (= do the cooking yourself) is your best bet here."}
{"text":"We came here for the lunchtime AYCE bbq deal. It was super worth it for the price you pay! They also have a lot of side dishes they offer for free -- the spicy bean sprouts were so good!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place that you can grind on crazy amounts of beef, chicken, and calamari (don't order the fish, it breaks apart), stop by Korean Grill.  This restaurants makes for a great dating venue."}
{"text":"Personally not a huge fan of this place. I felt it was overpriced, the food wasn't great and the service was average.   The meat wasn't marinated that well. There wasn't much flavour and I found it a bit bland. There weren't many options either. The side dishes didn't taste great and the rice I got was slightly cold.   The waitress carried pitchers of various drinks in her hands and set all the pitchers down on our table each time she refilled our glasses. While I appreciate our glasses being refilled, I didn't like having multiple pitchers sitting on our table while she was doing so. However, food was brought out at a fast pace each time."}
{"text":"I love the salmon Bibimbap here.  I don't usually go for the BBQ because it takes a while and you always end up burning things in the uneven heat.  However the salmon Bibimbap is excellent. I add a spoon of chilli sauce and yum! . Also the strawberry shakes are excellent.  So definitely worth a try..."}
{"text":"Luv tha setting, ambience, good-friendly service, and of course....the food   This is a good place for a couple, or a big group. The concept is cooking food, with good conversation, which means no tv's (which I actually enjoy). They have free wifi, so u can post while u eat too"}
{"text":"I thought the food was good before it gave me a horrendous stomach upset afterwards! I must've eaten something bad. Also service was sub par. They took the longest time to bring us our drinks, barely came to check if we needed anything else and besides we cook all the food ourselves anyway lol! To top this smiling was completely optional and so was the english language, AND they pre-charged us a tip on the bill for 4 people which they told us after we had double tipped them cus we had our bill split.. Not going there again."}
{"text":"A pretty standard kbbq place. Nothing too fancy but a good place to chill and eat a lot of meat with your friends.  It's 18.99 for ayce dinner. Meats include chicken, pork, ribs, beef, squid, fish fillet and salmon (and ox liver which we did not touch). A couple dollars extra if you want shrimp and lamb. If you want unlimited drinks it's $2.25.  There are also side dishes, steamed rice, and soup to choose from. No dessert though.  Service is quick and you get your food pretty quickly but fairly minimal. Start with the fish fillet as it is much easier to cook well on a clean grill and tastes much better. The salmon was decent as well though not the greatest. The beef was dry. The best meats would probably be the chicken and beef ribs. Very flavorful and marinated to be sweet.  I'd rather come here than Chako. Even if Chako is fancier the food quality is similar but Korean Grill House is much cheaper. Also at Chako the food is incredibly salty - I was still okay after this meal. Here they also added a 13% gratuity to the bill which was unexpected - I would not have tipped that much myself especially at an Asian place that doesn't have a lot of service. And we were only a party of four.   Overall still a decent experience though. Would come back if I was craving kbbq."}
{"text":"À notre arrivé à Toronto, nous cherchions un resto car nous étions affamés. Grâce à l'app Yelp, nous avons choisi ce resto. Quel beau concept, qui semble plutôt populaire dans les restaurants coréens de Toronto. Le midi le menu populaire est AYCE. Alors au milieu de la table une plaque chauffante de style BBQ alimentée au gaz autour de laquelle nous sommes assis. Sur le menu plusieurs sortes de viandes; poulet, boeuf, porc. À cela s'ajoute du filet de sole et du calmar. Alors, pour le AYCE, le serveur remet une feuille avec les choix de viandes et les accompagnements (soupe, riz, tofu, fèves germées épicées et nature, Kim chi). On fait le choix de ce que l'on veut puis remet la feuille au serveur. Il ouvre le gaz sous notre grille et nous attendons notre commande. Les viandes et poissons arrivent crus à la table, nous les mettons sur la plaque chauffante et faisons notre cuisson. Les viandes sont biens assaisonnées et gouteuses. Le choix est restreint pour le dîner, j'imagine qu'il est plus élaboré à l'heure du souper. Les portions des plats d'accompagnement, à l'exception du riz, sont petites. Le resto était plein et semble populaire et apprécié. Pour un bouffe qui ne demande aucune cuisson du chef, j'ai trouvé le service extrêmement long. C'est une bouffe légère qui demande de la patience, mais c'est très agréable. Mon mari dit y avoir bu le meilleur smoothie à la mangue."}
{"text":"The name says it all.  The true essence of eating here is cooking all the meat you can eat at your table. It also helps when you have master chef BF on the grill.  As he was grilling the night away, I loved sipping on my drink-all-you-can coke.  I wanted to give this place 3.5 stars but since there's no half stars, I had to round down. But I could easily round up.  I just need a couple more trips to confirm.    The service is nothing to talk about and let's leave it at that. But the kimchi and the flavourful meat can make you forget about the servers. Hopefully next time they will not be in such a rush to throw the all you can eat meat on our tables."}
{"text":"This place has vastly improved since their renovations, but their price has also gone up for the AYCE. Still, it's a good value, good food & good service. AYCE short ribs? Yes PLEASE! :)"}
{"text":"I've only tried the Queen St location and I'm sorry to say, Korean Grill Houses are owned and operated by non-Koreans and their flavours really show that fact.  I would not waste my money here if you're looking for authentic Korean food."}
{"text":"This was fun! Like said before you won't go there for the ambiance or the super service (it was alright, a tad slow / inattentive but bleh)   The good, again it's fun, AYCE is fantastic when it's actually meant as such. The waiters bring as much as you'd ask. The meat was marinated nicely. A tad on the sweet side. Cuts of the meat were no where near awesomeness but still not bad. Delicious beef and chicken. The sides while not great, weren't bad. Somethin akin to radishes? Delicious!  Bad; First things first, the positioning of the grill, it's awkward. It truly takes one on each side of the table to cook the food. The grill even though they change it when you ask (should be auto) gets really dirty quick. The pork had too much of a fat taste. Didn't like it. The rice again, not cooked as nicely as I'd would've hoped for Korean restaurant. Dirty glasses for the coke / water. Not nice and the green tea served in a dirty plastic glass.. Just doesn't have the same feel.   Overall, it was fun! I'd go there again just for the experience. (An yes prolly starve myself for a few hours to make sure I use up all that AYCE option!"}
{"text":"Was here by myself today. Probably should go with 2 or more to make it more fun. Service was OK. Food overall, very salty. Cheap though. All you can eat for $13.95 with probably 7 types of raw fish and meat to cook your self plus kim chee, tofu and Korean spicy potato salad plus rice is dang cheap. Started slow because this was my first time doing this grill your own meats thing. But after abut 10 minutes, I had that table grill thing dancing with sizzling meat and fish. The trick is get a good load going of a little of everything. As soon as its done, re-load with more raw before you eat which will be done by the time you finish eating the first round. Not sure exactly what meats they brought. Could have been German Shepard for all I know but it was good overall. I 'd try it again with a group next time."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch AYCE.  Mon - Thurs $11.99 Fri - Sun $12.99 Comes with beef, pork, chicken, fish, squid. The sauce they use for the meat is sweet and the meat is cut thin. You also get side dishes (raddish, bean sprouts with kimchi sauce, kimchi, tofu and regular bean sprouts with no sauce). The side dishes were decent at best. If you want lettuce wrap option its $3 extra a person.   The price is good for what you get but I would rather spend some extra money and get some higher quality Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was twelve years ago when my friends surprised me with a birthday cake with sparklers which activated the fire alarm.  Firetrucks came and we were so scared that we would have to pay.  They did ask for ID, and our only form of ID was our TTC student passes. Fortunately, we never had to pay for the false fire alarm.  I came again recently for a friends birthday.  We each ordered the all you can eat meat with liver, salmon, ribs, beef, fish fillet, chicken, and pork.  The beef shank was not the best cut, but it was very well marinated.  The other meat dishes were ok.  The salmon was bland, and I would recommend you dip it or cook it with the table sauce.  The side dishes (bean sprouts, tofu, spicy bean sprouts) were tasteless and I stopped myself at half a side dish.  I would recommend this place if you are a big carnivore and have a big appetite.  Definitely avoid if you're vegetarian and choose the vegetarian pho place across the street.  Remember to ask for your grill to be changed after it starts getting charred.  Restaurant staff were very strict on the 90 minute eating time."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday on a weekday last week. Iv never been to a Korean BBQ joint before, so I was very eager to see what they were all ranting about.   So before I came here they had told me about the all you can meat part, so I thought hmm okay piece of cake. Boy was I Wrong! They kept bring us cute little trays of different type of never ending meat...about 4 trays all stacked full of meat. Now imagine that and multiple it by 8 or so different types of marinated meat. Chicken, fish, rib, steak, salmon, chorizo, liver, pork etc. Along with that they brought us little bowls of rice. With many different types of Asian veggies. It was sooo good. Thank God it was about 10 of us....but even with 10 of us it was still tough to eat all that meat. My friends like to eat so they kept ordering tray after tray after tray, literally.   The restaurant itself is nice with the decor and all, so at the end the bill for each of us came up to $23.00 with included the all you can eat food and meat, drink and they had included a service charge which in my head had to mean tip, what I don't like is when they include the tip on the bill. Kinda bogus of you ask me. Next time I come Here I will starve for the whole day and come :)"}
{"text":"My boy and I were in Toronto for a wedding on Saturday and visited the Grillhouse on Friday night. We are both a bit familiar with Yonge Street and remembered that there are great spots to grab inexpensive meals. We were sat immediately and the spot was lively. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. I'm a veggie and had my requisite Bi Bim Bap and he had beef barbeque. While my meal was overall tasty, I was a bit disappointed. At any other Korean spot, my meal has arrived with my veggies, egg, etc sitting atop or aside the pot of rice. That works for me as I typically do not eat the rice (or have a bite. I'm not getting younger after all). At the Grill House the server mixed it all together. Oye. Way too little rice to the amount of veggie stuffs. Also, I missed having a whole fried egg to delight over. That said, the dish was still fresh and tasty. Boyfriend mostly enjoyed his meal. His dish consisted of strips or pieces of beef that we were able to throw on the pit. That's always fun. Our service was great and the prices are of course beyond resonable. While not my favorite Korean spot ever, most certainly worth visiting."}
{"text":"The reno job was done beautiful here.. Service was great that night coz we were the only ones there that night (Thanksgiving weekend).. At least you get your money's worth of food here.."}
{"text":"This place rocks!!  Went here during a weeknight to check it out and it was worth it!    The all-you-can eat buffet was worth it!!  The server was prompt and courteous, even when my clumsy ass spilt water all over the floor, and explained, in pretty concise language, how to use the grill!!  I felt like an amateur at first but it got easier as the meal went on.  When I'm entertaining guests, I'll be sure to bring them here!!  Keep up the good work y'all!!"}
{"text":"For the pricey AYCE kbbq dinner, I was expecting some great food and I was not disappointed! However, they don't really do \"traditional\" kbbq, like the flavors and ingredients are not down to the details authentic but it was still good, kinda like a chinese/korean blend?   Food: Anyway, for two people we both got the non-seafood AYCE which included chicken, pork, beef, sausage (wasn't a fan of it...), white fish fillets, and salmon. The bass(?) fillets were not good. they were too heavily seasoned and fell apart completely upon grilling, but on the other hand, the salmon was on point and I had more than 4 plates of it!  The chicken and pork were my favourites, they were very juicy and seasoned perfectly, not too heavy and not too light. Some reviewers complain that it was too fatty but I prefer it a bit on the fatty side when it comes to grilling. The beef was good, but nothing too special to rave about. I think it was just regular beef slices, not bulgolgi, so be aware of that!   We also got the $3.00 add on vegetables, and I wouldn't recommend it. The onions and pineapples were pretty good for grilling but we barely touched that and pretty much focused on the yummy meat instead.   Service/interior: The interior was very nice and clean, with a modern design to it and made a pleasant environment to dine in. The service was very fast, the servers came, dropped the food, and left. Efficient. On the occasions that we did talk to our server she was very nice, and was very accommodating!   Oh, and MAKE SURE TO CALL IN A RESERVATION! They get filled quickly during peak hours."}
{"text":"Been to this Korean Grill House a few times, but never have been so disappointed.   Apparently due to the \"holidays\", the service and the food was the worse I've ever experienced. We asked for a table of 4 but they always forgot one of us...whether it was water, rice or even chopsticks.   My past experiences here, were not fantastic but never horrible. The waiters are generally very quick and polite. This time we were barely seen and had to always waived them down. The upstairs room is barely more packed than usual.   Food was disappointing. Mostly got what seemed like scraps and leftovers. Beef ribs had so much fat that by the time it was done cooking, all the fat had melted and all that was left were the bones. Rice was very dry, more than usual. All meat ordered were mainly fat. Also, we had a curly black hair in one of the rice... The manager simply apologized and said she'll go hand picked more need slices.   Overall, I never thought I'd say I would be disappointed enough to never go back to a restaurant but this might have been the last push overboard. Korean food is always good, but I think we'll have to find a new place now!"}
{"text":"Although this isn't authentic Korean BBQ,  it gets the job done. Food's good, and that's all that matters.  Some pros: - service is great, a lil hard sometimes to track down someone to take your order but with so many other tables to wait on, I'm not too upset about it - wait time is never bad. The restaurant is big with lots of tables which always makes my visits here one without a wait time or a short one - prices are great. You get exactly what you pay for with lunch or night owl specials making prices even better - the AYCE menu has a pretty decent selection but if that's not enough, there's an extensive list of non-AYCE dishes to choose from - restaurant atmosphere is also great. Really nice place to chill and catch up with friends. - location of the restaurant is great. I say this because I like to skip out on getting dessert here and heading right across from the restaurant to Coco Tea and Juice.  Some cons: - sometimes servers' inability to speak English sucks. One time I ordered tofu and kimchi soup off the AYCE menu and they brought me tofu and kimchi side dishes instead. I asked for it to be taken away and attempted to order my soup again,  and once again they brought me side dishes. Happened again and I gave up and realized I wasn't going to get my soup. - wish their veggie side dishes were more extensive - wish they had sauces to eat the meats with considering their meats and veggies aren't seasoned.  That's all I have to say. If you're looking for a chill night out with our spending too much money, I recommend this place.  EDIT: I've recently become vegetarian since writing this review and something amazing at this Korean Grill House is their willingness to let me order off the AYCE menu while the rest of the table can still do AYCE. I've called other locations to see if they did this and this appears to be the only one willing to do so which makes it the best location in my books!"}
{"text":"Walked in here for a social lunch. Having been to other Korean Grill House locations, I can say that this location isn't the best.  Staff isn't that friendly or attentive when you walk in or when you're trying to order. The menu isn't as extensive as other locations despite this place being a franchise (no beef short ribs on the cheapest AYCE menu, correct me if I'm wrong though)? 3 stars."}
{"text":"I don't often go out of my way to write reviews for places. You can check my history and I only review a place if you've really hit a really high or low for me.   In this particular case, it was the lowest of the low. This kbbq place is literally the worst.   Do not come here!! To me and my friend's dismay, this place was just abominable. Service was the worst I've ever experienced and the food was sub par.   Our table dealt with literally the worst server. The whole time we were there, the guy literally socialized with his group of friends at a table next to us and rarely ever served us. His attitude was just off putting and we could tell the guy couldn't possibly care less about the kind of service we were receiving. Additionally, WE DIDN'T GET WATER UNTIL AFTER WE FINISHED MORE THAN HALF OUR FOOD, even after we asked more than a hundred times!!   The grill was badly charred halfway through our meal and they never offered to change it, even after our food was clearly getting coated in black residue which made the already sub par food taste like charcoal. After we asked, the grill was changed, years later of course, but at that point it was just too late.   The food was average, and that's just me being generous. The meat options were minimal and most of it tasted just plain weird. The sides weren't great either.  The bathroom was just filthy. It was located in the basement and it felt utterly disgusting. I felt like I came out of that bathroom dirtier than I came in. There was no soap!!!    Nothing could possibly make me want to recommend this place. It's just bad. Customer service is horrendous, food is sub par, and the price is far from reasonable considering all these factors. Please heed my warning. This is not a reasonable place to eat at and you will regret it!"}
{"text":"the best place ever. service is great and fast. very nice employees. welcoming and inviting atmosphere. food is well seasoned and delicious. tasty and good bubble tea drink hehe. kind of a crowded place for me but not very busy when me and my husband went there around 2-3 pm."}
{"text":"Great price range for all our friends. Love coming here, they don't rush you and the service is quick. The food quality  is solid without being ostentatious"}
{"text":"This is the first Korean restaurant I've ever been to that didn't include sides for free. I ordered the bibimbap, which was by far the WORST I've ever had, and literally only had bean sprouts for its vegetables.... I ordered a side of kimchi THREE times before they finally brought it out, and it was absolutely disgusting. I've never had kimchi that tasted like it was frozen, then microwaved, and then watered down, with SUGAR over it. My wife tried to order bulgogi, but they refused her as our dinner companions ordered all you can eat meat (which was also tasteless and gross). This was by far the worst Korean restaurant I've ever eaten at in any country. Stupid me for not reading the reviews first...  UPDATE: I'm now experiencing food poisoning."}
{"text":"Service is ok. They get things done when you ask them to, but that's about it. Food was decent, but I found a metal wire in my food... once I told them, they responded \"again?!\". (LOL!) They didn't even apologize, they just asked which meat, so that they could penalize the kitchen I suppose."}
{"text":"Crappiest korean bbq you can find. Salty marination, disgusting banchan. You will find yourself surrounded by high school and college students who probably never had authentic korean bbq before. If you are keen to enjoy authentic korean bbq, this is not the place."}
{"text":"This was the most uneventful/mediocre Korean food experience I've ever had. The fellow who greeted me at the door was morose which clearly didn't start things off on the right foot - the bulgogi was just plain blech. No flavour, barely any of the usual accompaniments which are standard at any of the other 10 or so Korean places I've eaten at. Leathery beef :( ick."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place to go with a small group of friends.  It's interactive, it's cheap and it will fill you up.  FOOD The food was fairly good for the price of $12.95 for an \"all you can eat\" dinner. The only issue I had was the m.s.g.  I mean the food tasted great but I was drinking endless cups of water b/c the m.s.g. made me so thirsty. Even at home as we speak, I'm still downing glasses of water. I hope I don't die from water intoxication! just kidding.  EXPERIENCE Very interactive. There is something to be said when the man you've been crushing on is preparing your food with such attentiveness to ensure that it's fully cooked and that you won't get sick. It's so primal but sweet at the same time. But if you're with a group of friends or with new acquaintances, it's a really good way to bond.  SERVICE The service was only ok.  They were good when we were ready to order and leave however for any request in between such as request for a knife (which they forgot) and more appetizers and dishes, we had to actively flag down a server.  They did not offer to change our grill.  The one thing I did like about the service was that as they laid out the appetizers and dishes, they explained what each dish was.  I found that only higher end restaurants do this so I was pleased when my server gave us a quick run down on what she was putting on our table.  COOKING CONDITIONS The room is a little squishy if you are a tall or bigger person.  The tables are grouped into 2s, 4s, and 6s.  For the 6 seated table, they tend to share the table with a couple and 4 person group.  So you're very close to the next person if you are a bigger person.  The temperature of the room was quite comfortable. I would have thought it would have been quite hot but even with all the grills cooking, I wasn't sweating.  All in all, great place for a cheap thrill and a full stomach. Just make sure you have a bottle of water with you as you walk out the door b/c you'll be really thirsty."}
{"text":"Yelper Kevin F (AKA \"K-Fed\") and I went to Korean Grill House last night, knowing very little about the establishment or it's unique concept.  Basically, there is a regular menu of Korean food, but it seems as though most people go for the \"All You can Eat Meat Buffet\".  All the tables have what at first glance appear to be big holes in the middle of them, but on closer examination are actually heated grills, each with a temperature control under your table.  We were each given a bowl of rice and a bowl of soup, and then presented with a bunch of cold side dishes and what must have been at least 8 trays of raw meat.  K-Fed is a little squeamish so we passed on the tongue and liver, but were still given plenty of chicken, beef (at least a couple of kinds), sausage, and fish.    Now the fun begins. At your leisure, you throw some meat on the grill, flip it a couple of times, and then eat up.  At first we were being really careful, putting one or two pieces of meat on the grill at a time, and watching them closely.  It wasn't long though before we (mostly me - I'm the bossy one apparently) were throwing new items on, flipping partially cooked items, and eating the fully cooked items, all at the same time.  Although a couple of items (the steak in particularly) were a little grisly, the meat was extremely tasty, and seemed of a more-than-reasonable quality given the $12.95/each price tag for this meal.  There are a few negatives.  The service was completely absent - we had to flag someone down each time we wanted something - more wine, our bill, etc.  I'm assuming we could have flagged someone down and asked for more meat, although there was no need because what they brought us to start was plenty.  The side dishes did not really appeal to us, outside of the spicy bean sprouts, which were tasty and a nice accompaniment.  And the bathrooms, well . . . I recommend holding it if you can.  All in all, a fun experience and I am looking forward to going back.  The total bill was $50 plus tax, great value considering we also enjoyed plenty of cheap house white wine while we ate."}
{"text":"You see that overall rating of 3 stars for Korean Grill House? It makes sense.   We came by at 10 pm on Friday to eat their AYCE dinner, and last call was at 11:30 pm even though they close at 2 am, which is weird. There are a lot of vacant seats but it gets filled up pretty quickly as the time goes by. We got our bbq orders first, drinks second, and then soup last. They give you slips of paper to tick off any more items you want to get, like side dishes or meat platters.   The service here can be very spotty- some of the staff are nice, some inattentive, some forgetful and others overcompensating. For a party of two the waiters gave us four glasses of water but neglected to give us our beef broth that comes with AYCE, which was actually pretty funny. They have two options for AYCE- one is $12.99 per person and the other is $18.99 per person. You're unable to share a portion either- you have to get two servings for two people. (Trust me- I've tried.)  The slices of meat are decent! It's pretty good because you can really create a stack of plates as the time goes by. I'm actually quite the fan of the regular bubble tea, which tastes more HK style than Taiwanese style (re: like milk candy). The soup is sour and not authentic, so come here for AYCE on a cold night.  Korean Grill House has inconsistent service and quality of foods, but overall it is good if you're starving and not picky with what you're getting!"}
{"text":"The food consistency is perfect, never tried the meat ! But looked tempting. However, the service was pretty quick. Tried the spicy tofu soup the best of all. Would definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of six. This is good place for group gatherings because it is interactive with people cooking and serving each other the food. The service was quick and consistent. We went after 10pm so it was cheaper as well. I liked this because often people working retail get off after nine making it difficult to find a spot with decent food.  As far as the food is concerned, it is ok , more towards the good side than the bad. The food is nothing special but it is the experience of cooking it and eating that makes it good. Some meats were marinated like the chicken, while the rest are brought out plain (beef, fish, squid, and pork).  This is a good for people who enjoy simple food.  For $10 a person, I was happy with the food and the service."}
{"text":"Great service, I was really surprised as all other Korean Grill Houses I've been to have had horrible service. The food was delicious, prices great for lunch. We arrived hungry and left happy."}
{"text":"the portion for all you can eat, very small. and the meat has been marinated with tooonnns of salt. I think I have eat my sodium allowance for the whole week. they are using a cheap cut meat, because if you see the beef/pork when you cook it, it just way too much muscle or fat. I hardly can eat the short ribs, because it have 80% fat vs the actual meat. also the kimchi has more oil than kimchi I guess I have to find other korean restaurant."}
{"text":"In all fairness, I used to love this place, especially for late nights. it cannot be beat, however, i had a horrible experience here last night. A group of 4 of us came in around 11pm and ordered the late night menu. The staff made a mistake and gave us the wrong order sheet, which included the beef ribs and the sausage (the regular price menu). We did not notice and ordered as per normal. The food was good and the meat was delivered quickly, however about half-way through our meal, a very rude waiter came up to us and asked which menu we had ordered. My friend said the late night menu. At this point, the waiter became very abrupt and proceeded to hastily remove items from our table. I was appalled, as this was their mistake not ours.  At this point we were a little confused, so we referred to the menu, and understood that they had made a mistake and were trying to cover themselves, fair enough, but they could have found a more polite way of telling us, rather than just snatching up things from our table.  After this, the staff became rude an impatient with us. We waited 20 mins after asking them to change our grill. They did so, almost reluctantly. Further to this, we were told, after only being there for 40 mins, that it was last call, even though the restaurant closed at two and others were still ordering. It almost seems like they were mad at us for their mistake.  In closing, decent food, good for late night, service killed it for us and we will not return, plenty of other establishments that can take my money."}
{"text":"As a Korean myself, I'd like to say that this place is NOT AUTHENTIC KOREAN food. All the workers are Chinese first of all.  I was visiting Toronto for a conference and decided to stop by this restaurant and was not happy with my experience.   The food is mediocre. Yes you get a nice selection of beef, chicken, pork, salmon, squid but they are not authentic tasting. The side dishes are limited and tasteless. Unlike the AYCE places in California, it does not offer side salads, rice wrapper, or dipping sauces. In order for refills on your food, they give you a form to fill out each time.   The service is fair but you have to flag them down to get more food or refills on your drinks and side dishes. If you really want authentic Korean food, you should head towards Korea town. Will not be back in the future."}
{"text":"i was so disappointed with this korean grill house. i went on a saturday night. originally from looking at the reviews and menu online, me and my friends believed that the night owl special was 11.99, but the waiter persisted to tell us that they changed it & it's now 17.99. Kind of a bummer cause we were going for the low price. we continued to be seated down & started to place our order for drinks. two of my friends ordered soft drinks & i ordered a water. the waiter told us that my two friends can only get canned drinks ($2) because i'm getting a water. unlimited refilled drinks are $2.25 ... i don't want to be forced into buying a soft drink. i don't like soda. i hate the fizz. He then brought me my water & THE CUP WAS DISGUSTING. that was 1 strike for me. going on with our night , we continued to order our meats (17.99 gave us chicken , beef & pork slices & fish fillet). one of my friends are allergic to fish, so we asked that he didn't get it, but once again , the guy proceeded to say that everyone must order the same things at the same table. it's 17.99 with or without fish. i don't understand why he just couldn't bring one serving of it. When we placed our food on the grill, it burnt instantly; our grill was way too hot. With all my anger built up with this place, i just went to the bathroom to try and escape the night for a little. However, when i came across the bathroom, the disgust of it matched the customer service. This was my 2nd strike. Coming back to my seat to try & rush through the rest of our night, we finished our first round of meat & wanted a second round. there was a little button you can press to request a waiter at our table . we pressed this button 100 times & no one showed up at our table. the button is completely useless. we waited like 30 min for a waiter to come and acknowledge we wanted more meat. When he went to get it, he took forever to bring it back out to us. Our appetite was kind of gone at this point. & i was just done for the rest of the night (strike 3). The meat wasn't well marinated; it was completely bland. The rice was hard & cold. The beef broth was gross. The kimchi was alright lol. We went to pay our bills & one of my friends was paying debit. They were charging $1 for using the debit machine & he was pissed that they couldn't mention it to him before. i do understand that some machines charge a fee, but it would be nice that they told us all the terms & conditions before the night started. I would most definitely choose chakos over korean grill house. this was my first & will be my last time ever going here. My bill here was $50 (2 people) vs at Chako's it was $56 (2 people) & at Chakos , we at least got better service , nice drinks , the meats we requested & a nice atmosphere with enough elbow space. i will never come here again."}
{"text":"I was really hungry so I'm giving this four stars. The food is good but not great. But the simplicity of it all makes it four stars. Just a few selections. I liked the chicken though it was a bit too salty. Pork was very good. Beef was too hard and dry. Fish n salmon were good.   I love that the air ducts are around the pan so the place doesn't smell. Other places have it over head which is useless. This alone makes this location four stars."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, he was really looking forward to it and that made me excited as well! First off, the feel inside of the place is nice (minus a little table-congestion), but we were sat in the corner, even though the place was almost empty! I ordered a margarita and my boyfriend got a beer, my margarita was terrible, it was bitter and a weird mix between shaken and iced, very odd.  We got the meat deal (all of the meat plus all of the veggies), that was really great. The meat is marinated but I didn't have a problem with it. I loved the kimchi!   The downfall of this place was definitely their service, my boyfriend and I were having a great time, until we ordered more food and asked for water. They forgot our water and then told us they lost our order (this happened twice). The server avoided us like the plague even though I was attempting to flag him down and did not check up with us once on his own.   I may go back here because the food was good and the experience was unique but they really have to work on their customer service, which put a dark cloud on the entire evening!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time in a while. This restaurant is part of the same chain that is in Scarborough at Midland and Finch, where I used to go all the time, back in high school (scary to think that was over 10 years ago!!!) So I'm probably a bit biased about this place since this is what I think of when I think of korean BBQ, authentic or not!  I don't think anyone can argue with me as a place that is solid value for the money. If you're hungry, and craving some meat, this is the place to go! It's all you can eat, and your food is always hot and tasty, since you cook it the way you want. The regular all you can eat menu is $12.95. We went after 10pm, so we got the late-owl special, which is $8.99 for all you can eat beef, chicken, pork, squid, and white fish, with rice, soup, and sides like kimchi, tofu and bean sprouts. The meat is probably not the best quality, nor the service, which is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5,  but for the money, it's a solid choice, and a very affordable option downtown.  Some tips from my many years of korean BBQ'ing - cook the fish last, since it tends to stick and leave a char-y mess. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My relationship with Korean BBQ has become more complicated recently than ever before. Most of this stems from my own heritage, and a desire to preserve a strong perception of Korean culture and its cuisine.   Places like Korean Grill House test me. While I truly do love Korean BBQ as a whole, and all that stems from it - including the culture that surrounds it, these restaurants bring me to question the space that Korean cuisine occupies in North America.   It's not about authenticity, per se (for those who don't know, Korean Grill House is not a Korean-run establishment). I am a huge fan of fusion, and cultural appropriation has, in my opinion, led to many steps forward for our society.  Really, there's another reason: for many North Americans, Asian food is equal parts cheap and crappy. Korean food is usually no exception to this.  In many ways, North Americans are justified in this belief. When your exposure to a cuisine is limited to that which is created by untrained immigrant workers, and largely to one dish, your expectations are limited.   Imagine if Canadians immigrated to India and only made bad poutine - you'd have waves of Indians believing that that was all Canadian food was.   Here's my other qualm: Korean Grill House exists to feed the lowest common denominator the most amount of food for the lowest cost. In doing so, the perception of Korean cuisine shifts from what it truly should be - food that stems from a poor and agro-centric society, with fermentation taking center stage.   But even so, Korean Grill House's success could also be a good thing for Korean cuisine. Even poor iterations of food can act as a gateway to further exploration. There is no better example than the success of Japanese cuisine.   The worst thing that a place like Korean Grill House can do is provide a frame of reference for Canadians on what Korean cuisine is. The best they can do is act as a lubricant for Canadians to explore more of Korean cuisine. That's the ideal."}
{"text":"This place has great value if you are craving a LOT of meat. Personally, I think their pork is only so-so but the beef was quite delicious. I prefer the dinner menu over the lunch menu because of the sausages, they cook fast and the blend is very juicy."}
{"text":"Coming from out of town, we wanted to try a new Korean bbq joint in Toronto. Me and my group of friends decided on this place due to its decent ratings and convenient location in downtown.  Although the place was getting pack, we (group of 7 people) were able to be seated right away. The workers were very nice, and our food came out pretty quick except for the pork bone stew. Despite the food portion being quite generous and the price being moderately fair, the food was just not tasty or good... the bulgogi and kalbi for bbq lacked seasoning, the pork belly was very chewy, their beef sizzling plate with rice was a little too peppery and their 'bibimbap' lacked veggies and sauce. On top of that, their sauces were limited to chilli oil and diluted soy sauce.   So, while the service is good, the food is a hard pass. I honestly don't understand how people raved about this place, I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Meats are not taste like Korean bbq except beef libs. Their service was the worst. It was the first time for me to tip less than 10%."}
{"text":"Came here once with a group of 3. We didn't really want all you can eat, so we just ordered menu items.   FIrst of all, their service sucks. I believe this place is Chinese-owned. The workers ignored us when we first walked in, and made us feel really awkward. They were setting up a table for the previous group. My friend was in the way of the worker, but did not even say excuse me when he wanted to get through.   We were seated at the very front, so it was difficult to get our waiter's attention. He also barely came around to see if we were okay.   We ordered 2 noodle soup dishes and 1 teriyaki chicken meal. I ordered the pork noodle soup, which was kind of bland tasting. I guess it is a very typical dish with not a lot of other food. My friend on the other hand had a seafood noodle soup I believe. Hers had a lot of various seafood and vegetables, making the soup taste very good. The teriyaki meal was a typical bento box style meal, with tempura, salad, etc.   Most people probably come here for all you can eat, which is never a disappointment. They are pretty cheap too, around $14 even for dinner time. But do not come here for normal food. Also, we didn't have to wait for a table. We came on a Sunday night though, so that may be why."}
{"text":"love it, great food, not good for dating, since the smell will be all over the place.. lool"}
{"text":"Good Korean grill near Eaton Centre. The marinate is good. We got beef, ox liver, salmon, fish fillet, chicken, pork, pork belly. The fish fillet was bland and liver was meh. Salmon and chicken was really flavourable. Such a fun place to eat at for a date or group of friends. Even alone. No judgments here.  The staff is attentive, nice and considerate. Bigger groups will most likely be seated on the second floor which is way bigger. Caution: will smell like BBQ grill after."}
{"text":"Not bad. Went there after 10 pm. for the night owl special. the food is adverage n the service is average. i will come again."}
{"text":"Korean Grill House is what I expect from an AYCE kBBQ place. The food was adequate, though I found some of the dishes were suspicious, like how the raw ribs were brown and not red. I'm guessing that's from the meat being old. All in all, the food was fine and I did not get an upset stomach.  The waiters seemed standoffish, but the service was quick! I have gone to a kBBQ place where they gave us a two-hour limit. However, there was no limit here! Servers seemed annoyed we came late, but that's to be expected. They are busy. Service was pretty good.  I would come back, perhaps for lunch since it is cheaper."}
{"text":"Great inexpensive low carb option. The KGH has a 14.99 all you can eat grill your own meat fest. This place is open till 11 or midnight every day. And after 10, the price drops to 8.99!  The price includes soup, rice, Korean veggies and these raw items: beef, beef ribs, tongue, sausage and a few different fish.   Most of the meat is okay. The best is the beef ribs. Keep getting more of those!  Skip the seafood. Pretty bad.   All in all a good value for the money. Definte repeat if you are into the low carb."}
{"text":"Every once in a while I long to have AYCE Korean bbq until I can no longer move. I love that Korean Grill House now has little order forms you fill out and hand to the server; it is really effective in decreasing the chance of orders being missed!  Dinner AYCE on a Sunday night was $18.99 I believe, which is a reasonable price considering all the meat you get! The dinner includes Beef, pork, beef ribs, chicken, ox tongue, squid, fish filet, salmon, red sausage... and side dishes of bean sprouts, spicy bean sprouts, kimchi, beef soup, raddish, tofu and rice.  The beef ribs are my absolute favourite as they are fatty and marinated.   Remember to ask them to change the grill to a fresh one midway through your meal!  The only downside is you will smell from head to toe after a meal here...so make sure you shower and do laundry when you get home."}
{"text":"The definition of \"You get what you pay for.\" Space is clean and modern, but food is really subpar. Halfway through the meal I realized that there is absolutely nothing Korean about this restaurant except the name... couldn't they have at least hired one Korean chef?? Giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the final bill was unbelievably cheap and nobody at my table got sick."}
{"text":"I've tried many different Korean BBQ restaurants and I just find the meat quality isn't the greatest. This place was no exception. We were here this past Friday and I found that our chicken (though we cooked it thoroughly) tasted like not real meat if that makes sense. The beef slices were the best. I don't eat pork so I can't comment on that, but from the other diners with me - they found it to be just ok. The fish (assuming Tilapia) & salmon was not marinated and just tasted so bland.  We also got rice and found it to be very dry.  I like the concept of these places I just think they need to improve on their meat standards.  I would have given this place 1 star, but their customer service is great. Unfortunately the experience as a whole was subpar."}
{"text":"The menu is all in Chinese and they make you pay for the sides. There is nothing Korean about this place. We walked out before placing an order."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and always content with the service and food available. Great spot for mid-night snack. Location is great too when you don't feel like travelling to Korea town for some Korean bbq. It can get busy during rush hour times but the wait isn't very long."}
{"text":"This is my 1st time going to a Korean all-you-can eat bbq. I know there are a few locations in Flushing, NY. I went here on my last day in Toronto for lunch. The lunch deal was sooo good. You def get your money's worth of food. $12.95. Yes the quality isn't there, but you have quantity. And for $12.95 CAD thats awesome. Korean BBQ in NY is  over $20 for 1 serving and you usually have to order a minimum of 2. The best part about this place is their Ox-tail soup. It was seasoned really well. The banchan was mediocre. The meats/fish were mediocre. I mean what can you expect when this place is run by Chinese people instead of Korean people. Will i visit this place again if i visit Toronto? Maybe.... I do want to try the ones in Flushing to compare it with tho."}
{"text":"Reasonable AYCE menu - we opted for $17.95/person which included lamb and shrimp. This did include small selection of panchan. Could add $3 extra for veggies, but we did not. Standouts were lamb, beef ribs, tongue, and liver. Basic service. Decor was super casual."}
{"text":"I had my first experience with Korean BBQ here and really enjoyed myself with my family. I DO NOT suggest the ribs, as they were all fat and bone, but the beef, pork and chicken were all really great. I loved the thin slices, as it was difficult to screw up cooking anything, and the bubble tea I had, had real fruit in it floating around :) YOU NEED TO ASK FOR A GRILL CHANGE WHEN YOU NEED ONE, as I found they didn't ask, but were more than happy to do so when we did. The wait staff was fine, the guy we had was friendly and we were seated right away. It wasn't busy when we went, but seemed steady. I'd really like more veggie selections and vegetables in general though, and the tofu we had was ice cold in the middle and oozed liquid although it was cooked on the outside. Will be going again, but trying something else and not eating the tofu."}
{"text":"Came with some friends yesterday and the service was okay. We had the $18.99 Korean BBQ all you can eat per person with 2.25 fountain drinks. At the end the price for tip is included in the total which is not acceptable in my opinion. The food was okay, the beef and pork weren't the freshest but the chicken redeemed it. Dessert is not included. I would say that it is an okay place to go because it's so close but other than that it's nothing special."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for pictures... I had trouble looking for the profile for this place located in a local mall since I didn't actually have any idea where my friends took me, but the business front photo taken by Jennifer K. seems to match that of my own.  Based on the sign on the storefront, I would say this place was called Korean BBQ Restaurant.  However, based on the menus provided inside, I'd say an alternative name would be Korean Grill House.  Well, whatever you call it, it is basically an all you can eat grill your own Korean food spot.  There were two BBQ menus available for dinner - the $13.95 version included pork, beef, chicken, beef ribs, ox tongue, ox liver, salmon, squid, fish fillet and unmentioned portuguese sausage, while the $16.95 version added lamb and shrimp to the basic menu.  Six banchan dishes, rice, and soup accompanied the servings of raw meats to the table.  For lunch time or late night you get a more basic selection of meats for $8.99.  For an additional $2 or so per person (it was all or nothing!) we were able to enjoy unlimited select drinks (soda, plum, ice tea, cold soy milk), of which pitchers were delivered to the table.  The tongue was rather tough when grilled, and the cooked fish threatened to fall apart on the grill.  Personally, I enjoyed the flavor of the tender sausage, but agree with a friend that it wasn't particularly meaty in texture.  Everything else was okay, with the exception of the liver... but hey, I'm not a liver kind of girl.  Still, so easy to stuff yourself!  Bathrooms are located by the entrance, and are simply marked with the symbol for male and female... too bad I couldn't remember which was which.  Good thing two staff members taking their breaks on the nearby bench was able to point me to the right one, which happens to be the one on the right."}
{"text":"I love Korean BBQ but for whatever reason when I left this place I was just sick to my stomach.  I almost ended up chucking it all back up. I think it might have been the salmon because the person I was with doesn't eat seafood and he was okie.  Over all the place was lovely and food was good but I think I'll steer clear of the fish next time."}
{"text":"Pros:  + food is tasty + Decently priced  Cons: - service is slow (to bring you uncooked meat) - not all servers speak english - washrooms are disgusting  Went there with 2 friends for dinner. We choose the all you can eat option.  Food: The meat is pretty tasty. You have too cook it yourself.  Service: For ordering uncooked meat to be delivered to your table, it takes a really long time.   Not everyone speaks english. We ordered a pitcher of beer (a big sign $14) that is only on Monday.  and 19$ for the rest of the days.  Locale: The place is pretty clean upstairs, but the washrooms have a really bad smell and look they were added last minute.    I would suggest going there if you are looking for an experience and tasty good, but don't expect great service."}
{"text":"Good place. Alot cheaper than chako.  No sushi tho"}
{"text":"2.5.  I walked in and was seated immediately for their AYCE dinner service. Their A/C was probably turned to the max. I was cold and some tables around us even decided to out their jacket on (this, compared to the 29C temperature outside). Service was frequent, but they kept forgetting to refill water despite pressing the Drinks button 3 times and verbally asking for more water twice. They eventually just brought a pitcher and left it at our table.  Quality of the food was okay. At least a third of the ribs we got, we never cooked because they were just cuts of fat.   When it came to the bill, I understand it was from my own ignorance that I did not check the bill properly, but I did ask \"why is it so much?\" out loud and the server standing next to me did not say anything. So I tipped them on top of the tip. Always check your bill thoroughly....I will not be back."}
{"text":"We had a late dinner here yesterday. The food was delicious and plentiful. The service was fantastic and the price was affordable.  I'm not sure what else to expect from a Korean BBQ joint... it was just as I had hoped for and I'll definitely be back... Thanks!"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked through the doors the service was fantastic and the food amazing .......... li and chan made the night just that much better!! We are so glad we trekked through the storm for my boyfriends birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"Korean Grill House is a Korean restaurant with the option to either order off their menu or have AYCE meat / seafood.  Be warned that this place gets pretty busy during prime dinner time so make sure you go early if you want to beat the crowd.  If you are going late-ish, you might want to park underground as the parking lot isn't large for the number of shops there are in the plaza.  I've ordered a meal off their menu only twice so I'll keep this review for the AYCE portion.  Their break down is as such: $13 for beef, pork, chicken, fish and squid at lunch or after 10pm, $20 if you want that between 4pm and 9pm and $22 if you also want lamb and shrimp included in that.  The AYCE includes side dishes, rice and soup.  You're also required to pay an extra ~$3 for ice cream and another dollar or two for your drink, as they're not included in the meal.  Add tax and tip to that and you could be paying a fair amount of money per person.  Lamb is usually one of my favourite things but it's not the best here.  On my last visit anyway, the lamb was usually cut pretty poorly - it'd be better if they were left at a decent size like their beef slices.  Their pork and beef are good though. Chicken's probably my favourite at this location as it's usually really good.  The service is up and down.  When you're ordering, they give you a small piece of paper with a chart on it so you can order whatever you want.  Only problem is they don't always remember to bring everything for you.  We asked for radish on several occasions on my last visit and it took 3 people and 20 minutes to get to us, when it should take maybe a few minutes.  Same with the ice cream - which easily another 30 minutes.  If you're comparing to Chako, Korean Grill House definitely isn't close to it in their service or food quality so it's a bit of a coin flip as to which you want to go to."}
{"text":"I can only speak for their lunch specials..it is a really good deal for the $ you pay. You get miso, bento, and also a beverage. The short ribs is the best imo!! The squid and the chicken were meh, definitely not worth the money when you can get the delicious short ribs for a bit more $. Squid was hard and dry. Service can be improved, didn't check up on is once. It was also difficult for us to get a server's attention."}
{"text":"Decided to come here as friends were visiting out of town and are a fan of kbbq. This place's location can't be beat so we decided out of convenience to give it a try it. Once you enter, there's a lower level and an upstairs. Although not sure what the lower level is for, we headed upstairs. During our visit, Friday evening, the front door was super crowded and we were confused if there was a wait or not - but people were just standing around blocking the door to keep warm?   Anyway, we got upstairs and were served immediately. We were surprised at how empty the store was for a Friday night. There were maybe 10 tables max occupied. We were a group of 4 and to our surprise was only given one grill to use (comparing to the other big franchise Chako, which gives 2 grills for 4 people). The waiter came pretty quickly to take our order and drinks. We had the option to choose individual dinner or all you can eat kbbq which was nice. Of course, we went for kbbq as that was our intention of coming. You order all you can eat on a sheet of paper that has all the items. Variety was decent, but vegetables are an additional $3 though. Side dishes were tiny but was nice to have. Food came promptly, however, the first round, we ordered chicken and few others which didn't all come. I think they miss orders on purpose if you order too many? It's really like how other yelpers mentioned, first 15 minutes was okay but the experience goes downhill from there, especially if you come with a party of 4 and everyone's trying to cram all their food on one little grill. I guess it slows down the cooking process so you don't get to eat as much? Anyhow, we had a total of 2 rounds which I see is the norm from the tables beside us. The service was not overall too bad and the servers did attend to us whenever we needed something. We had the grill changed once and they were pretty prompt about it. For the price, I would say it's decent for what you get but it's too bad they don't include dessert like their competitor. Overall, I still prefer Chako and don't think I would return again.   One issue I had here though was not food or service but the bill. I don't recall seeing it mentioned anywhere but I think they automatically charge a service charge or something because the bill came to $24 after tax which was only suppose to be $18.99 plus taxes. I didn't realize it was more than I should've paid until after I left. Can anyone confirm this?  Ps. it's pretty stuffy and hot in there - bad ventilation - so be prepared to smell like a greaseball coming out of there"}
{"text":"Everything was bad: food (too salty), price (expensive for such a poor menu), if you want to have vegetable you must pay extra 3$, time is limited to 1 hour 30 mins, 13% total bill tip was automatically added to bill even we were just 2 people (this should be voluntary). The only up side was pretty nice staff. I don't know why many people wrote good reviews for this restaurant. I won't come back!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch or dinner.   I fin it a great communal experience with friends and family. The selection of grill items is great and so are the sides.  I'd avoid the fish though. It tends to break up and gum up the works.  Service is OK, but you don't got to a place for the service. You go to grill stuff!"}
{"text":"im not going to write a review really, if you dont know what this Korean BBQ chain is about by now, then im not going to sway you, more just some tips.   I have eaten at 3 of their locations over the last 7-8 years, and I like this location a LOT more than the Bloor/Yonge location.  Reservations are a good idea, but half the time they screw it up. So make sure you get the name of the person you are speaking to. That saved my bacon once when they couldn't find my name. (they wrote it down as Jim, not Tim, ughhhhh)  I dont know if they have changed their sausage meat recently, but i really don't like it anymore...?  Can't beat the price though for dinner, 2 people can have AYCE and ice teas for $50.   MEAT COMA!"}
{"text":"All you can eat meat!! The service is generally pretty terrible, always have to flag them down to get more meat or drinks.  I looooooove the pork. I could eat the BBQ pork from there alllll dayyyyyy"}
{"text":"FOOD & DRINKS Just don't expect quality food or authentic Korean BBQ. You will be disappointed very fast. I love Korean short ribs and ordered as much as I could but they taste like Chinese cuisine meets Korean BBQ. You can eat them and it will fill your stomach but it just does not give you the feeling to crave for them every time you are in Toronto.  SERVICE The service staff did their job. Not very enthusiastic or super friendly. Just doing their job was good enough for them. I ordered salmon and they offered me squid... I never had to wait to get some more water but they really need to change the grill from time to time!  ATMOSPHERE This restaurant is not a place to chill out and relax.  The interior is plain, does not feel very clean but simply OK. Restroom is not maintained very well...  RATING You might want to come here with your friends to do some BBQ, drink some beer and have fun while you are in the city. Everything was rather OK than good."}
{"text":"This was my first time having Korean Food. Even though there was particularly no customer in the restaurant, the waiter came about 15 minutes later while we just sat there.   The dark meat bbq chicken was so succulent and delicious. Chill oil was mixed with soy sauce to flavour nicely cooked rice. You have to try the kimchi."}
{"text":"Lots of protein!!!!!! So much protein!!!! If I lived around this place I would come here after workouts. It's a pretty standard all you can eat Korean BBQ place. The service is fairly good and the good tastes okay. The reason it's not 4 stars is because it doesn't taste amazing and the seating could be better.   I recommend going late at night for their night prices! Cheap!"}
{"text":"very tasty. overpriced. not authentic korean. meh. If you want authentic Korean find a place that serves samgyopsal with lettuce, kimchi, rice, the works. There are several places in Toronto waaaaay better than this place which are authentic Korean and not just a rip off."}
{"text":"Really bad service. You have to remind the servers AT LEAST 3 times to get what you ordered. & I ordered a taro bubble tea and ended up getting purple ice water with old tapioca half an hour later. We have to wait so long for our rice to come that our meat gets cold. Terrible!!! Will not go here again."}
{"text":"Maybe we're a bit spoiled from Picnic Garden or real Korean BBQ places. But here we go..  We started off with 3 beefs (bulgogi), 2 beef ribs (LA Kalbi), and some seafood on the side. It's Korean BBQ, you're supposed to be eating Kalbi and other beefs, right?  Well, the very first slice of beef I grill, I place it on my plate and find that it's been grilling with hair. I'm not talking one strand, I'm talking I spent about a whole minute pulling out a few strands of short hair. Needless to say, appetite and mood, ruined.   At this point I realized that the waiter was Chinese so it might have been a bit easier to communicate to him that way. I called the waiter over to inform him and he didn't seem to taken back by it, just told me he'd replace the raw foods. Upon return, he told me that our drinks would be on the house for the fault.   \"I never thought I'd see the day that we are in a 'Korean' restaurant and you're speaking more Chinese than I'm speaking Korean... at all.\" -my lovely Korean boyfriend decides to crack a joke.  Anyway, after a while, it gets a little difficult to grill because it's covered in burnt fat and oils. This is the part that annoyed us the most. At a \"Korean Grill/BBQ place,\" they're supposed to change the grill every so often because the raw food doesn't cook right especially with the rounded grills. They accumulate more oils because of the material. We ate through some amount of food and every slice of meat and poultry was picking up the hardened oils and fat that tasted like coal. We had to ask him if he could change the grill and after he did, he rushed to ask if we were finished or if we wanted more food. Mind you, we were the only ones there and wait a minute, from what I recall this was all you can eat?   By that point we really didn't want to eat anymore. Honestly, it's not Korean! Why are we calling it a Korean Grill House!   If you want to go there for a cheap imitation Korean bbq meal, this is for you. Otherwise, I'd say nay. Pay a little extra and go to a real Korean place."}
{"text":"For the food I give them 4 star.  Because the meat was marinated and they did not have too many sides dishes for you to fill up on,  which was great because I don't eat too much so the Kim chi and radish was perfect to pair up with the meat.  But for the service I give them 3 star.  But it was because I went on the weekend and it was around 8pm,  so it was pretty busy. Other than that the price and the for was great."}
{"text":"Go for the all you can eat. You're not paying for service, you're not paying for the decor, you're not paying for a unique dining experience it's $10 for all you can eat meat. Grill it yourself, ask for as much as you want, enjoy the food and the company and be on your merry way.  The warm sake helps ;)"}
{"text":"I've eaten one of the tastiest yet cheapest meat in Toronto at this place. The steaks, chicken, lamb and, pork are marinated in sauces that make the dish simply delicious. No matter how much you cook it, the taste is still amazing because the sauce is perfect. I LOVE the steaks here...   There is a few cons: 1) The sea food dishes, they did not really have anything special about them, taste was just OK, it lacks the perfect sauce the meat has and, 2) The salads are not worth the price and not tasty at all. Again though, the steaks are DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"great all your can eat korean bbq. ive eaten here at least a half dozen times & it has been great each time & they offer a full bar."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Awesome Korean BBQ that you cook and grill there at the table.   Awesome experience."}
{"text":"It's not the first time I come here for korean bbq. The price is pretty reasonable for all you can eat meat (chicken, beef, pork, liver, squid, salmon...$16.99). It usually comes with water, but don't mind to pay extra for coke, iced tea or prune juice (free refill yay!).  The staffs are friendly and quick. If you ask them to change the stove they will do it right away.   Try to eat the meat with radish or kimchi if you start to feel sick from the oil.  Not my number one choice for bbq but I will love to come back here because the price is pretty good.  I don't know if you notice but the second round you order, the meat will be saltier than the first one. It makes you want to drink more and get full quick. A good trick: order soup that includes in the ayce menu, then dip the meat (grilled) in there for 2 or 3 seconds. Don't worry, it's still very tasty !"}
{"text":"Neat place for Korean BBQ and during their all you can eat lunch and late nights, this place is a steal. The queen street location is by far the busier of the three in toronto and has the best vibe to it. For $10 you get unlimited meat to chow on so no complaints here and nothing else in the world matters in my humble opinion!!!"}
{"text":"I have so many problems with this place..... If I can give less than 1 star I totally would!  Problem #1. This place is listed to close at 1am. And 3am on Saturday. I came in at 1030....they told us last call for food at 11pm. Your sign says you close at 1am!  Problem #2. We asked for sisscors to cut the meat. They gave us a butter knife that was worse than a child's toy kitchen knife.  Problem #3. The staff is rude. When you ask for something they kind of just look at each other like you speak a foreign language.  Problem #4. The washroom there is disgusting. Doesn't look like it was cleaned EVER!  Problem #5. When trying to pay with a credit card. They charge you an extra fee! My bill was $130! And you are going to charge me an extra fee!!  Problem #6. I think they reuse the food because they did everything they can to make sure the food that wasn't touched didn't get dirty.... Gross.....  This place is disgusting and service and food was not worth your money. This place does NOT get a pass in my books. I will never give my hard earning money to this place."}
{"text":"Another great restaurant. My party of 8 was 25 minutes late but they still honoured our reservation. Fast and courteous service. Food was good. I had the seafood bibimbap, which tastes really good. They have a really good selection of bbq items, even for vegans!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say I don't ever have a terrible experience. Le boyfriend and I come here maybe once every few weeks when it's late and we're hungry in the area. Last night being one of those times. We walking in it being 10 after 11:00pm and they still took us (I'm not going to lie a few occasions years ago they wouldn't let us come in if we came in that late) the employee informed us that it's almost closing time so we reassured him we should be out before then.   I always (almost always) get a Sapporo and le boyfriend gets a soda or ice tea. We order our food, it comes out quickly and we cook. Regardless we were still out before midnight when they closed.   The food is great, the service is excellent. The spicy bean sprout is the best ! -- thank you"}
{"text":"The concept here is great. However, the meat is more like fat with bits of meat on it. Every order of meat I put in, they brought fatty meat after fatty meat. It's 100% not edible if you care about meat quality and not chewing on greasy fat."}
{"text":"I pass by this place all the time on my way home and it's always busy. I finally tried it yesterday and now see why it's so busy. Stopped in with my woman and we had the dinner for two, wow was that a lot of meat, so make sure your hungry! The food was well marinated and the sides are great, my favorites are the ribs so tasty! Skip the fis it breaks apart but the Shrimp and Scallops are tasty!"}
{"text":"Korean Grill house is located on Yonge between Gerrard and Gould on the East side and is located on the upper level of the building (this is confusing, i have no idea what's on the bottom but I've always been taken upstairs).  I came here a few weeks ago with my coworker and was pretty pleased with the food and the price so I ordered some takeout to have back at the office. The Beef Bibm Bahb was just over $9.50 with tax and was ready when I went to pick it up. My coworker had this dish and shared with me the previous time so I knew it would be good.  A note here, it took forever for them to answer the phone, I was about to hang up. And the guy on the phone who took my order wasn't personable at all. Unfortunately, this is just a small part of the disappointment to come...  Get back to the office and open the container and it looks good, all the rice and kimchee and beef together topped with a fried egg and the hot sauce on the side. Went about mixing in the hot sauce and got down to eating. First thing I found was a short black hair. Since my hair is super long and light brown, its definitely not mine. Unfortunate because it was great up until that point. Did my best to cordon off that side of the dish and continue to eat since I was only a few bites in. That's one star gone right there.  Just when I thought the taste would still prevail, I crunch down on something so hard, I can't bite through it. Have to spit out the mouthful to get a look and it seems to be a piece of ceramic, eerily similar to that of the bowls they typically mix and server the bibm bahb in.   Big, huge, massive disappointment. The food here that I've had has been quite good and for the price, you really can't beat it. But finding a hair in my food is bad enough to then be followed by finding a piece of ceramic in my food? That's a big huge fail and I'm only hoping I chewed everything well enough that I didn't swallow any ceramic and encounter any issues later on. My tooth still hurts from biting down on it.  Overall, good food, not worth the risk of who knows what being in your food. Fail to the N-th degree, I will NEVER come back here EVER again and I recommend the same to you. Avoid like the plague."}
{"text":"where else can you get sooo much delicious meat in delicious sauce!  I love this place when I'm craving a huge meal and have a lot of time.   their service is great but the soometimes don't bring every single thing you ordered (I think they forget) but I never quite get upset because I think it's understandable.  their lunch boxes are pretty worth it too!"}

{"text":"Not bad but not amazing. The price was around 23.99 I believe for Friday night so I think it's cheaper compared to other bbq places such as gyubee. For meat the beef chicken pork are good but they get burnt so fast. I was excited to try the sausage but it got burnt every time so it tasted bitter. The kimchi is good, but the beef soup tasted so weird and bad lol almost like dish soap couldn't drink more after 1 sip. Also the rice is kinda old but I understand they r a bbq place so they don't rlly care about their rice probably.   Service was fast tho and always cleaned up the empty plates   I think their late night time would be most worth it if u r just coming during dinner time I would not recommend here"}
{"text":"Overall an oh kay Korean bbq. Nothing amazing, We did the all you can eat, including the lamb and shrimp.  Loved the beef, chicken, squid, so super yummy. The salmon and the unidentifiable white fish werent that great, lots of tiny bones. I don't have patience for that.   Did not eat the shrimp, they kept looking at me and I felt bad cooking them.  The side appy s;  were oh key. But not so good. Kimchee wasn't that great, everything was really bland.  Staff seemed stressed, not very attentive, asked for napkins a million times, ended up going to the front desk to get some.  Would I come back here? Wouldnt make the effort to do so ..."}
{"text":"Food is amazing here. Service is wonderful. You know what you're getting. Lots of meat that you cook yourself its AYCE too."}
{"text":"Went around 6pm with plenty of seating.  Service was great at first, server was attentive, brought us drinks and the meats fast.  Then died off later on when the restaurant got busy since there was 2 guys serving.  You get 2 sheets to fill out, i guess you can only order 2 times or something.  First time there, not a fan of korean bbq.  We had pork, pork sausage, beef ribs, chicken, salmon, fish fillet.  Basically we just grilled them and ate them.  Not much flavor but burnt bbq.  After about 1 hour and a half, server left us for dead, asked for tea, ice tea, multiple times, and never received it, guess they wanted us out.  When i asked for the bill, he was quick...  Overall I wouldn't return.  Sure it was a nice experience cooking your own food on a grill.  But there wasn't much flavor, and everything tasted burnt after a lot of meat.  There just wasn't any contrast or difference in flavors compared to other buffets."}
{"text":"I've been to this kbbq countless of times and only during lunch hours and after 10pm. Why? Because it's only $10.99 for All you can eat pork, beef, chicken, squid, fish fillet, etc. The meat is amazingly marinated that you can't help but order more within minutes. I just recently went this week after a year hiatus as I was out of the country and was so impressed with the quality of the meat. They did jack up the price a dollar more since, but not that big of a deal.  Obviously veges is something that kbbq needs to include more of, but hey the experience is all about meat so.... go with the flow. If you're not a big meat eater, this is definitely not for you.   For the price during the \"special hours\" and the quality of the food, you get what you get. Make sure you're craving meat, because you're going to get your money's worth of it. They also have unlimited drinks.   Lunch time is definitely a good time to go because it's not nearly as busy as at night, making sure you have good and quick service. If you do go during dinner time or late at night, it does get super packed and the service drops.   Although they give you 2 sheets to fill out, you can ask for more sheets (which is what we did, and the lady gave us 5 more).   All I'm saying is that if you want good service, go during lunch because it's quiet.   Overall not a bad place at all to satisfy your kbbq craving."}
{"text":"I come here quite often and always enjoy the food. I came here with my girlfriend on Sunday and we had the night owl special for $12.99 each. We arrived 15mins earlier and we were still able to start the late night special :) The service is generally good, which i would rate a 3.5/5. Sometimes you have to flag then down to order more meats. If you cant eat anything but chicken, i wouldn't recommend this place because they dont serve any veggies to grill either. You would have to check out chakos for that. I personally love all meats and if your like me, defiantly try korean bbq or chakos out!"}
{"text":"I have been eating AYCE Korean BBQ at Korean Grill House since all the way back when there was only 1 location in Scarborough.  Now there are multiple locations and my fave downtown is this one on Queen Street.  It's always busy here and the service is better.  I know many reviews say it's not authentic Korean BBQ, but most of the AYCE sushi places are far from authentic Japanese - I think it is the nature of AYCE.  Authentic costs more and some customers just want a lot of food for little money and authenticity doesn't matter.    My personal fave is the marinated beef but my friend who always goes with me loves the Beef/Ox Tongue which now costs extra, where it used to be part of the premium AYCE dinner menu.  The lime soda is just Sprite with a bunch of cut up limes squeezed in but is a refreshing drink to cut the grease from the BBQ meat.  The soup is like dishwater, I never drink it.  I don't think the Kimchee is authentic because I love it here whereas I don't like Kimchee at authentic Korean restaurants and PAT grocery.  For the price, even if you only like one of the meat options it's still a bargain, especially the night owl special price."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible. They serve meat in small trays with lots of juice in it. I was worried about touching it and cross contamination.  Most of the Waiters didn't seem as welcoming. I asked for sesame oil and salt and the guy didn't know what I was talking about. I then asked for red korean sauce and it was $1. Really? It should come with the cost! To make it worse Kimchi was slimy."}
{"text":"haven't had this chain restaurant in over 5 yrs and it was amazing just to eat it again. my friends and i went here after Grease musical on a a Sunday afternoon andnwere seated quickly. We all got the ayce for 23.99$ and that came with the basics: pork, pork sausages, beef, beef ribs, salmon, fish, ox liver, calamari and chicken. We were all very full and satisfied by the end of the meal. The service was fast and staff were polite. And we were able to get our grill changed half way through woth no problem at all. What we noticed was that when we ordered 4 of a certain food, only 2 would come out - don't know if they didn't want us to be wasteful or because they mis-counted. All in all, it was a good experience"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and thought in terms of Korean bbq, it's not traditional. If you're looking for traditional bbq, this isn't the place for you.   The taste of the food itself is actually pretty good. All you can eat ($14) included pork, beef, chicken, fish fillets, and squid. There were a couple of basic sides included as well.   The problem with grilling the fish fillets is that they would break up and are too fragile to cook on the grill. They also didn't have any marinade on them. All of the other meats were marinaded and were good. The chicken was a little too fatty for my taste though.   They didn't have the oil and salt and used Chinese chili oil instead of Korean chili sauce.   Service was very fast and there was plenty of service. They were very attentive which was appreciated, though not super friendly.   Overall it's a good deal for all you can eat and tasted good, but this is not the place for traditional Korean bbq lovers."}
{"text":"I used to be a very frequent korean bbq customer with this chain of restaurants and this was my first time coming to the new Yonge and Dundas location. In short, it is very similar to all the other korean grill house restaurants, AYCE for low prices and tons of MEAT MEAT MEAT.  A quick rundown on how korean grill house restaurants work. You can order AYCE or you can order off the menu (everyone gets AYCE), however if one person gets AYCE in your table, nobody else can order from the menu, everyone HAS to get AYCE. Basically, they give a you a large selection of meat and there is a grill in the middle where you essentially cook the meat yourself given a pair of tongs per person. Meats include beef, marinated chicken, lamb, squid, fish, etc.   Let me start off with the food. If this is your first time coming here and you are CRAVING tons of meat and grease then you're going to love it here. It is essentially unlimited meat grilled to your heart's desire (not really since all your arteries will be clogged up afterwards). However, the meat here is  LOW quality meat and full of grease and nasty preservatives. The food is very very greasy and may give you a stomach ache afterwards if you eat way too much. Also, although they say it is \"Korean BBQ\" the chain is actually Chinese owned and the BBQ here is not authentic korean bbq. Authentic korean BBQ has much higher grade meat and is generally not AYCE. If you are craving a lot of meat and/or are with a large group of friends and you want some AYCE this place is great. However, if you are on a date or want a nice classier dinner, this is definitely not the place to be as you will smell like grease and your stomach will feel horrible afterwards.  The service here is mediocre, it is not amazing yet they are not generally horrible. It was a problem for us getting the attention of one of the servers as they do not constantly come and ask if everything is ok or not, you have to call them down (in typical chinese restaurant fashion).   The decor is quite nice and the place is large enough to fit a lot of people but it is not overly popular unlike other restaurants around the area. We arrived on a friday dinner and there were tons of open seats whereas places like salad king were full to the rim.   In short, come here only if you are CRAVING all you can eat greasy meat and don't mind the low quality cooking. It's alright, I have to admit we always have these cravings every now and then. Don't expect a nice, classy dinner with a date, this place is just a lot of fun cooking and hanging out with a large group of friends."}
{"text":"Meat galore! You will swim in raw meat ready to be cooked. This is an all you can eat place where they give you the meat and you do the cooking. Wear cheap jacket as you'll end up smelling like smoked prosciutto.   I will recommend this place to any adventurous and want spice up an otherwise boring dinner - cooking your own food is FUN! Very fun!   The quality of food is great for what it's worth... under $ 15. Don't expect fibre... you won't find it from here."}
{"text":"Not the most authentic or wide range of AYCE kbbq. If you're willing to pay the price for a better kbbq experience, I would suggest somewhere in koreatown.   For the $17 AYCE dinner, you only get around 8 different meat options plus banchan which is kinda a disappointment to me. You get so much more variety at Chako for instance. And the meat wasn't even great quality either. On the slip of paper to reorder more food, when asked what was the difference between the liver or some other meat listed, the server wasn't able to identify it......  However, servers were nice and attentive - checking in on us and constantly refilling water (don't know why they didn't just give us a pitcher of water). They are a little slow.. But are apologetic.   Meh. Decent place."}
{"text":"Mad enjoyable lunch. For $11.99 I got the all you can eat meat extravaganza. Mostly things were your standard fare - the side dishes included bean sprouts, kimchi, daikon, tofu, and so on. The quality of meat was decent and I only had a tiny bit of gristle in one piece. For some reason the squid was particularly good. Even with my sloppy cooking it didn't taste like garden hose. My only regret was the short ribs weren't an option with this lunch. Boo.  I haven't been here in quite a while, so the Holden Caulfield in me is glad to see that things are the same."}
{"text":"If I could give a one-star rating I would, this was the worst Korean Grill House I've been to. First of all, we had to wait for 20 minutes for service despite our constant attempt to order. Second of all, they messed up our order of drinks, and didn't refill after we asked them. Third of all, as we were eating, we were told that the restaurant was closing in 15 mins, and our grill will be turned off at 12AM and we won't be able to cook any of our food which just arrived. Furthermore, when we wanted to finish cooking our food because there's just 5 minutes left, we were pushed to pay our bill. One more thing is, there was a waiter there doesn't speak English. I would never go back to this Korean Grill House."}
{"text":"The Korean Grill House is close enough to my work that I can drop in for a quick lunch during the week.    I'd love to do the AYCE lunch but never have enough time...plus I hesitate to return to the office reeking of BBQ.  This location of Korean Grill House always offers plenty of seating so it's a good alternative to Ginger across the street, which is usually packed and cramped.  I usually go for one of the bento box lunch specials - beef and chicken with rice, kimchee and radish ($5.99).  I found the meats a bit fatty, definitely not high quality.  Kimchee is just okay...not spectacular.    Service is fine, a little slow on the tea refills.     Not my top choice of Korean food but fills the weekday kimchee cravings."}
{"text":"Went there last night. Was not top... customer service was slow... had to ask twice for a green tea. They serve hot beverage in cold drink glasses. I find the grill little too small and we were 4. I went to the washroom and it was not clean. And it's too pricey."}
{"text":"Small modern designed restaurant. The set up of the shop is very well thought out and well performed. The fans of the grill are on the sides of the grill rather than on top like places. This is good because you dont have smoke in your face all the time. The grill was good and always hot. The Prices for korean bbq VERY good. All you can eat is available for a good price.It includes alot of different meats. You will eat your filling. Ok now on to the part that causes it to get a 2 star. The food here is NOT authentic korean food. 1st of all korean's are known for there little dishes of pickled food at the beginning which most places have around 10-15 of. This place has 5. Kim Chi was one of them and even that was not very good. The meets were ok but not marinated properly. So if you looking for a place to eat just meat and your not into real korean food this is the place to go. If you looking for authentic korean food go to korean town."}
{"text":"So delicious! I'm a regular here coming once every week or two. We always do the BBQ. I'm absolutely hooked on the beef ribs! So juicy and their BBQ sauce is really good. Service is always great, and the food is usually pretty fresh. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Went back today for their midnight owl. ($11.99 - came up to around $16 per person with tip & Coke)  The quality went d-o-o-o-o                                           -o                                              -o                                                -own hill. The fish did not taste like fish but a mush of ... well mush soaked in soy sauce. The squid rings were grossly flavourless. The beef was basically falling apart. ]:  I missed coming here & then remember why I didn't come anymore.  They are also sorely understaffed as the drinks came 15 minutes after our food.  I never ask for much of service from Asian places but they were too busy to even clear tables to sit people piling up by the door."}
{"text":"Worst Korean bbq I've ever had... Meat is not fresh, and very fatty! All meat/fish is seasoned with so much salt/soy sauce too... Side dishes are not authentic, and they only give you a little bit. Service is slow and grill area is small. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Usually come here for the Night-Owl Special so I can't really talk about Lunch or Dinner. But at this time it costs usually $15 a person or so. This special starts around 10:00 so; so come early especially on the weekend as it does get packed.   Service is pretty bad to be honest, I get they're busy but even if you use the call pad they still won't come. It takes pretty long to order your food. The meat is subpar but it does only costs $15 for all you can eat, beef, pork, fish, squid and chicken. Chicken and beef are my go to, they don't take too long and usually taste pretty good. Need to come back during lunch or dinner but it is pretty expensive and you can't go wrong with waiting till 10 Pm."}
{"text":"This place is extremely unsanitary. Cups looked like they've never been washed. The grill for the BBQ was way too deep, making it hard to cook food. Further, I have never seen worse service at an ayce type restaurant before. Basically...go to chakos!! You'll get a much better experience"}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times, and haven't left disappointed once.   The kimchi is so good here. I love it. it's made sweet and spicy at the same time with a hint of sour.   the night owl (11.99 for basic pork, beef, pork belly, chicken, squid, fish fillet) I would say is worth it. But the actual real deal (ribs) are 10x better. so we got that ordered on the side for ($11) which only came with less than 10 ribs.   the soup was sort of sour or maybe it was the bowl..  I usually go crazy over it but hardly finished one yesterday   the service is good. friendly young servers,  the lime soda juice is good but expensive lol"}
{"text":"$16.95 for AYCE BBQ. $3 extra per person if you want veggies and pineapple to grill alongside. Not terrible.   My only complaint is I can never eat $20 worth so it's not an especially appealing concept for light eaters/small ladies. My 270lbs brother, on the other hand, was in heaven. I occupied my time doing all the cooking for him and stacking the meats on his plate as he ate.  You get a few banchans alongside, bean sprouts, kimchi and potatoes, which our waiter was happy to refill over and over.  Our service was great - there was only one guy serving a room of 5-6 tables but he was super fast and friendly"}
{"text":"I love this place, everytime we have a university reunion, we come to Korean grill house. Where else can you get all you can eat chicken, beef, bbq ribs, salmon, squid, miso soup, rice, and drinks for like $13 a person!  Is the food the best quality out there? Of course not, but you get what you pay for. And for $13, I'll always choose this place over east side mario's, casey's, boston pizza, etc. which costs over $20 a person to eat.  5 stars to Korean Grill House!  For people complaining that this isn't authentic Korean BBQ, I've gone to the real places on Yonge St between Finch and Shepphard, and I'd rather eat this one. Also for authentic Korean BBQ you are looking at paying approx $25 a person, which is twice the cost of here."}
{"text":"One of our usual spots when the boys just love to dig into BBQ meats. Ran by Chinese staff, it is not authentic Korean food but good enough. Sometimes certain side dishes are not too fresh so we stay away from them. They should really get some samjang for dipping and maybe more choices of vegetable side dishes."}
{"text":"Decided to be very typical and come here late at night after getting my fitness on at the gym. Three of my guy friends and I came with a very large appetite, and at that point I was so hungry that anything I put in my mouth would taste good. Unfortunately, my experience with the food here was not that good but honestly I cant complain. With 9.99 per person for all you can eat pork, chicken, white fish, and beef, food quality kind of goes out the window. The most disappointing though was the missing short ribs, its not AYCE without the short ribs!  This place did have some good qualities though in that the servers were super quick and very attentive and the kimchee was better than any other AYCE place I had been too. It was also quite busy even though it was around 10:45 when we got seated. Dont expect a well dressed fancy crowd as almost everyone in there was dressed in either gym clothes or wife beaters, and yes I am ashamed to say that I too was proudly sporting my leggings, sweater and nike shoes.  Overall, food quality was meh but I guess it will suffice for the purpose of why anyone goes to AYCE late at night anyway. Next time my late night after gym bulking (lol) hunger hits I think ill just go to Chako."}
{"text":"Sunday night dinner (AYCE) $18.99 Includes: Beef, Pork, Chicken, Fish Fillet, Sausage, Salmon, Squid, Ox Liver, Beef ribs, Side dishes, and rice.  FOOD: I've always enjoyed kbbq. Not because I like to eat a lot of meat or anything. It's just general idea of sitting down in front of a hot grill in the middle of the night, watching your food cook and the wonderful smell. The food here is alright. Nothing to be excited about. For an AYCE, I guess the price is considered decent. They have a night owl special (10pm-close) for those of you who go out late. For $12.99, the meat selection is cut in half. In my most honest opinion, it's not worth it. Because I love my ribs, salmon, and sausage. The ribs is really the main dish. Has anyone noticed that their beef has gotten worse over the years? It's a huge chunk of bad quality beef with no fat. WHERE'S THE FAT?!  And their side dishes..it was awful. Radish had no crunch to it, the kimchi was watered down. Potato - didn't they used to serve some sweet honey potato? What happened?   SERVICE: Angry faces, occasional rudeness, and very forgetful. We asked for a grill change and it took 4 reminders to finally get it done. And is it just me or do they never bring the right amount of dishes you ask for?  LOCATION: Is fine. A bit small and tight. Try parking across the street by Scotiabank.  CLEANLINESS: Assuming they don't spit in the food, it looks clean and ever since the renovation, the place looks a lot nicer.  CONCLUSION: I prefer paying the same price or more (for 2) to eat authentic (or close) kbbq in North York's ktown. Tons of side dishes that actually taste amazing, deliciously marinated Bulgogi (beef) and Kalbi (ribs).. Oh that fatty pork belly...and the yummmy eel!!! Drools..!! And to top it off, they usually come with a stone pot soup of your choice. For two people the bill is about $30-$40 (depends on what you order). You really don't know Korean bbq until you've tried it. It is to die for :) I recommend Oh Geul Boh Geul or Piggy's Restaurant or Songcook's (all in North York). SO good but unfortunately not AYCE."}
{"text":"Great prices and portions for lunch. My brother and I only had half an HR for a quick lunch so we decided against the ayce option. Their lunch options are coming very well priced. He had a beef and pork lunch box for $12 and I has a kimchi tofu soup for $6-7 which came with rice and three Korean appys. We both barely finished our meals and it definitely hit the spot !  Very well ventilated for a BBQ place and the ambiance was very nice as well."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here just before 10pm on a Tuesday. We got the AYCE for $22.99 -- tried the pork, chicken, beef, salmon, beef ribs, squid, sausage (fish fillet and ox liver are also included, but we didn't sample those). Meat was delicious and seasoned well. I think the only thing that was too salty for us was the pork. I loved the salmon and chicken. My girlfriend loved the beef ribs. It definitely isn't like, fancy restaurant quality of meat, but it's what I expect from AYCE: sometimes you have to cut your meat with your fork/tongs so it's not all one big piece, but it tastes good and price is reasonable (albeit ever increasing..) as long as you bring your appetite.  We also got the AYCE veggies add-on for $3. The veggie AYCE does not have a section on the order sheet, or its own order sheet. So you aren't able to order \"__ mushroom\" or \" __ peppers\", the way you do with other items on the sheet. All the veggies come on one plate (as opposed to each veg having its own little plate like the tofu and sprout sides, for example). This means they were all touching each other and there were pre-determined amounts of each one. Our single veggie plate had two big leaves of lettuce, two pineapple rings and so on.  So if you'd rather not have certain ones, if you want something like mostly onions, or someone in your group is allergic, I'd recommend asking your server.   Service was perfectly fine. I think the fact that it wasn't very busy affected it a lot, because I had no problems with the service. They were great about refilling our waters frequently (though I will say the water glasses they give you are tiny!) and flagging someone down was really easy. We didn't wait long after ordering to receive our food. We asked to get our grill changed once and they did it quickly. There is a mandatory 13% service charge with your bill, our server circled it and pointed it out when they gave it to us.   A couple of jerks walked in at ~11:20 pm and asked for a table. It takes zero brain cells to realize that after you finish eating, people who work there need to clean up after you and most--if not all!--establishments will start cleaning just before closing for efficiency. They were refused, because this location closes at midnight on Tuesday and it very obviously would take more than half an hour for even a group of two to receive service, cook their own food, finish eating, etc. They complained about how \"the sign says midnight\" and how they would leave a bad review because they were refused a table for a completely valid reason. The point is: I heard you say that, assholes, and you looked like grown men in your 30s, so please stop being embarrassing when I'm trying to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"The Mixed Vegetables Bibm Bahb was amazing. My friends ordered the seafood and chicken bibm bahb and were equally pleased and delighted with their meals. On a recent Friday night, the restaurant was full of friends and families dining together. Service was good."}
{"text":"Having never eaten Korean food, I ordered Mixed Vegetables Bibm Bahb last night for dinner. It was one of the best things I've eaten in recent memory. The servers were efficient and friendly; my water and tea glasses were refilled, without my asking, several times. When my meal arrived, I took the opportunity to let it cool and changed into my Halloween costume in the downstairs washroom."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was efficient. Went there for the all you can eat korean bbq special. Not a bad price for what you get."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since I was a kid and it's been my fav original korean bbq spot! It's been consistent throughout the years and it's cool to see the company grow and have more branches!!"}
{"text":"I've been here before twice with my fiance and my cousin. Once in 2010 and another in 2011. I love the food and how you GEF to cook it how you like. It was a bit packed inside and service was lacking the 2nd time around which is why I'm knocking it to 4 stars. I would definitely come again though."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend around after lunch time. It wasn't as crowded as I thought so we were seated right away. In the beginning, they gave one of everything of the meats for the ayce kbbq. The side dishes were really good, the picked radish and carrots really complemented the food really well. Service was attentive, they kept coming back to tell our water. Overall it was a good experience and I would likely come back when I am in the mood for kbbq."}
{"text":"Great Korean BBQ in a relatively fun atmosphere.  Don't go here if you're a vegetarian; the meals are generally all meat, and the portions are extremely generous.  Don't bother ordering the all you can eat meals; the moderately-priced regular meals are enough for two people and they cost about half as much!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, usually at night due to the late-night special they have. It's 9.99 per adult, all you can eat beef, pork,  chicken, squid, rice,  beef soup and a variety of side dishes to choose from.   Service is quick but, I wouldn't say attentive since we have to ask several times for our orders and/or to change the grill.   It gets really packed on the weekends, especially at night so make sure you make reservations! It can get really loud so you'd have to raise your voice to have a conversation.   The decor is modern, lights are dimmed throughout except for the bright lights that are lit directly above the grill and your table.   Overall, it's a good place for an inexpensive BBQ (if you're going at night). Too bad they don't offer this deal on a specific day except for at night."}
{"text":"First of all, this place isn't an authentic korean bbq restaurant.  This cannot compare to picnic garden back in nyc, where the meat portions are bigger, squid is fresher, and other options to grill as well (foodwise). However, this place is cheap for an AYCE restaurant. Until tips and tax racked it up to $21.45. -_- The kimchi tasted funny. Still edible, I guess. The beef, ribs and salmon were the only things I really liked. Squid tasted kinda fake . They give really small portions at a time, so it's really annoying to keep having to fill out the slip. Customer service wasn't all that great either. Yes, it might have been busy but we asked them to change our grill, and they never did. The waiter also gave us dirty looks for giving them more slips. It's AYCE, what do you expect us to do? Not eat? All in all, I have experienced better service and better food at other places. Will not come back."}
{"text":"Fun and different way to dine in and eat at a restaurant with a group of friends/ family. Lots of choice for meats and alternatives (if you're vegetarian, seafood is available like fish and squid). Nothing gourmet here but definitely a place to go if you want some comfort food. Service is speedy, and prices are fair."}
{"text":"The Korean BBQ myth has been built up quite remarkably in my life. It seems that whenever anyone I know (usually a group of people) invites me out for this mysterious phenomenon, there is always a reason I can't attend. This has happened probably close to a dozen times.  So, I finally took matters into my own hands. And that is a good start for the Korean Grill House, because a lot is in your own hands. Like, raw meat. And cooking it. An interesting and (as my parents would say) million-dollar idea that is just crazy enough to work, like crazy ($).   I left ordering up to my seasoned dinner companions, who ordered the all-you-can-eat meat extravaganza (they also happen to be 2 of the best cooks I know, so I was regrettably, a little lazy when grillin' time began). Though I was freaked out at first by fishy component of this deal, I soon calmed down when I realized that I could have as much beef and chicken as I wanted. I also think it was a good exercise in defeating my panicky, cross-contamination-concerned, will-the-blood-get-on-my-plate tendencies, because by the end of it I wasn't even thinking about the chicken touching the beef on the grill...but I was wondering if the waitress felt the same way at first about carrying all that stuff around.  And for all the perceived tininess of the dishes, getting your favourites brought back again and again surely fills one up quite effectively. Free-flowing Coca-Cola was also nice, and did I mention how tasty the meat itself was? 'Twas."}
{"text":"I love Korean Grill House and this location is extremely busy. You fill out a slip of paper and the server will take it to the back and arrive with some meat. We got the vegetable and meat ayce option which came it to $25 each. However, not all we ordered came as it was busy (enough to satisfy us but we did get hot dogs a short while later). Vegetable is simple mushrooms, cucumbers, lettuce etc. Kim Chi is good but the beef ribs are the best. The chicken, beef, ox liver, squid are adequate but the pork sausage is really good when crispy. Overall would return in a large party to get guaranteed service and  but would prefer to another Korean grill in the city if possible."}
{"text":"This place has fast become my after work eatery. The amazing $8.99 price tag I pay for lunch, also evidently applies to late night (after 10pm).   I usually skip the fish because it breaks apart on the grill making everything so of taste a wee bit fishy. The chicken is usually too fatty and takes too long to cook, but the beef a squid are where it's at!   For $3.99 a person you can also add some (much needed) veggies and pineapple slices. The downside is that everyone at your table must be willing to pay the $3.99 for you to get some greens... This can get tricky in large groups (containing douchebags!)"}
{"text":"It's really just an all you can eat place for grilled meat, but I guess that's what Korean BBQ is.  For the price it's alright, like I said it's just meat and rice, it's nothing special.  I'd rather spend a bit more and go to a sushi buffet but this is a good experience for those who haven't tried it. Also, it's good for small crowds.   They only accept cash and credit and the service charge is included."}
{"text":"Not a tons of late night spots open where post-event hungry can be satisfied. It's a great option if you wanna fill up your tummy and keep your wallet happy.  12$ for late night all you can eat? You can't go wrong. However, the options are limited to beef, chicken, pork, squid, or fish............ a drunk meat lover's paradise!!!!"}
{"text":"Once every couple of months, I'll get this ravenous desire for meat that can only be fulfilled by a huge steak, or Korean BBQ. Sorry, vegetarians.  I haven't taken the trip to this Korean BBQ location in a while, but the more I think about it, I am totally due for a visit. This place is efficient and gets down to business, which must be pretty easy for them since they don't actually have to cook anything.   For the flat all-you-can-eat rate, you get unlimited amounts of meat and rice, meat ranging from beef and chicken to squid (careful cooking the squid-- it cooks SO fast). They give you Korean appetizers like Kim Chi and those yummy soy beans, and then you get straight into the meat party.  This place can get packed since it's in a really central location, so arrive early or make reservations if you're in a larger group. It's definitely not a place for everyone to enjoy all the time, but it has its time and place, and sometimes, there's nothing better than a plate full of meat."}
{"text":"9.99 all you can eat Korean BBQ buffet including unlimited pork, beef, squid, chicken and fish. If you want vegetables you need to add 3 dollars. But my main course is only meat, so it was not a problem for me. The chicken was so fresh and tender, and the sauce was good too. With a bottle of plum juice, cannot help feel full and happy"}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends and decided to try the AYCE lunch special for $11.99 per person. When the server first brought out the side dishes, I was surprised at the small quantity of banchan in each dish. The same thing was true about the chicken, pork and beef. Although I liked how you could order more of whatever you wanted onto a piece of paper provided and give it to the server, I felt that each portion was a bit small. Overall, the meal was decent for an $11.99 AYCE meal and it is a good place to come for lunch with friends."}
{"text":"Honestly, it's an ok place. If you're just hungry and you just need rice and a bunch of meat. Price is alright, I guess for the price you pay for the quality of the meat. Appetizer wise, It's adequate with the soup, tofu and sprouts. Service is quick as well. If youre just looking to eat less oily food and eating with friends, this might be the place to go. Remember to change your grill when it gets too charred"}
{"text":"Had the lunch buffet at the Yonge/Dundas Location.  The service was slow. The atmosphere was rather lackluster.  The deal breaker for me was the food. It was bland and flavourless.  They serve poor quality beef which is almost inedible. The grill dries out the meat too much and I have never been a fan of the taste of charcoal. To be honest, I prefer Korean BBQ restaurants which use the table top grills. It is so much better for the meat to cook in its own juices.  The grills at Korean Grill House are not people friendly. You can't see half of the grill from where you are sitting, so if you are using all of the grill you need another person to grab the pieces from your \"blind spot\". Another issue that is easily solved by having table top grills.  I wish I could say more but I've repressed this awful meal from my memory. There are many amazing Korean BBQs in Korea town. Go there instead."}
{"text":"I loovvee Korean BBQ but I didn't have the best experience with his place. I went here on Valentines day with my boyfriend who wasn't my boyfriend then, and some other friends. We had 6 people and luckily got a table fast without a reservation (not sure if they actually accepts them for day) BUT they only sat us at a table made for FOUR people. It was super squished and my boyfriend's back was being stabbed by a wall pillar and my feet were on top of some kind of metal box/cage. The service was quite slow but it was super busy so it is understandable. Because there was only 1 grill for SIX PEOPLE (5 big eaters) It was taking a long time to feed ourselves, and we ended up leaving with a quarter full stomaches so we wouldn't miss the latter movie. Overall I would rate the food four stars if I had a decent amount to eat."}
{"text":"Food was OK.  Rice is very dry.  I got kind of grossed out by the amount of raw food around.  I have done some \"cook your own\" style restaurants before, but the sliced meats and fish grossed me out.  Also, where do they buy their chicken from?  And what the hell are they fed?  I have never seen chicken with so much fat.  Very strange."}
{"text":"I cannot put into words how much I love Korean BBQ.  The first time I went to a place like this, some 5 years ago, I was a little sketched out about the fact that I had to cook my own food.  But after having gone the first time, anytime KBBQ is mentioned, I get a little wet down there from excitement.  If you are a first timer, get the standard all you can eat.  You will get the following:  Beef: This is the best thing here.  I literally take one plate and put it ALL on the grill at once.  Spread it out and give it like a minute and its done.  Beef is the best for two reasons: it is the fastest to cook and it is deliciously seasoned/marinated.  Ribs: In my opinion, the next best thing.  Tastes amazing, but takes much longer to cook.  Pork: A good balance of taste and cook time.  Not as good as the beef though.  Chicken: Not a fan.  Chicken takes FOREVER to cook and is just a hastle.  I can finish 2 plates of beef before your chicken gets even close to being done.  Fish/Squid: Waste of time.  Also, you get unlimited sides of rice, kimchi, bean spouts and all those other small dishes that are delicious.  Don't hesitate to order more but remember: THE BEEF IS THE BEST!"}
{"text":"T-RexXx ( carnivorous) . I know that grilled plate need to be change before food get burnt.  But their  grilled plate already have black burned n black sticky oil on it. I prefer picnic garden ( nyc) grill bar n grill plate.  1. Sapporo draft beer. The best for my nite and price is reasonable for jar on monday .  2.  short beef ribs. Really tender n juicy,  unless u grilled too much. But my second time order, they don't give me the amount I want. May be I eat too much already.  3. Shrimp, squid, salmon r ok.  4. Ox tongue. Not available.  Mostly students are here and prices are reasonable.   I was business trip to toronto and I found this restaurant from yelp. So I give a shot and its ok. I told myself that I should go for korean restaurant instead of bbq buffet joint. Most important for me is i feel like my grilled plate is way too burnt but no one  change it or ask. I am not sure how much dark burnt charcoal meat .me and my wife eat. Overall. I will look for higher rating joint in toronto for next visit."}
{"text":"AWESOME SERVICE TODAY! It was jam packed with customers but for some reason the service was EXTRA great today! Lot's of refills + brought us our dishes quickly!"}
{"text":"3 words.. Not Very Good.  I LOVE KOREAN BBQ!  But maybe it's because they are all downtown Toronto and are in \"hip/trendy\" locations.  Personally I did not like this one at all. The food is all the same- all you can eat pork,ribs,beef,fish ect.. But the restaurant is so big it feels like you are in a cafeteria in highschool. So many tables, too many people, very loud, not enough servers. People were litterally sticking their hands in the air to get servers attentions!  Downtown it is free refills of almost everything. But here, no.  They barley even refilled our waters.  I do not reccomend this location to anyone.  Its great if you do not want to drive all the way downtown..but if you do want to have alot better service/atmosphere I reccomend anyother of their locations."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered the AYCE which was $23.99 per person. The server gave us the menu and we checked off what we wanted. From past experience, it takes at most 5 minutes for them to bring the food out (chicken, beef, pork, etc), but this time we waited around 25 minutes, and there was still no food. We tried to make eye contact with the servers but they just ignored us until one of them came up, and asked if we filled out the order. When we said we did, he told us that they lost it, and asked us to fill out another order. In the meantime, they gave us pork, beef, chicken right away, so we didn't have to wait for a second order. Due to the poor service, we decided to take tips off but when the bill came, tips were already included (13%) and they don't mention it unless you had to analyze the bill. Also, the bathrooms are disgusting."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after a Raptors game, because we were craving Korean bbq. I've been here a few times and it's okay, not amazing but not horrible.  To begin, the service is okay. I mean, there's a bunch of waiters that will be helping you out. Majority of them are nice, but make sure you look at what they are giving you, because sometimes they can get confused. However, the waiter did let us know that the tips were included, which is a huge plus because some Korean bbq places do not tell you.  The place itself is alright. I personally feel like it's so crowded in there that you can literally hear other people's conversations around you. Also, the washrooms are pretty gross! So I suggest you don't use it unless you really have to.  The food was alright. I personally loved the beef and thought it was the best to cook. Ribs were also good, but the beef was better. One sad thing is that this place does not have dessert, not even ice-cream!!"}
{"text":"Service: had a lot of trouble getting the waiting staff's attention. Although they don't have bad intentions, the staff seem very incompetent in fulfilling their waiting duties.   Apart from the service, the food was not authentically Korean, however it was still very delicious. For a very cheap price of ~$6-8, the place offers barbecue lunch bentos.   Wish there were Korean side dishes though."}
{"text":"Rude server, wouldn't give us more meat because he thought we wouldn't finish it, which we did. We also asked him to change our grill and he replied with, \"Later\" in a disrespectful tone. Also when the lady was changing our grill, she made my young brother hold the metal rim while she changed it, which he shouldn't have. The sauce  from the rim dripped on his pants. The staff is just unprofessional in general with an exception of one female server.   Also Beware: they add 13% gratuity for all you can eat without telling you."}
{"text":"First thing first night owl special went up to $17.99... I remember when it used to be $10.99...  Ive been here many times and as usual the service is what I always expected which is bad... Servers will either ignore you or walk away if you don't raise your hand up to get their attention. Also lately they don't give everything you order they always limit the side dishes depending on the amount of people sitting. But with all these things I still come here as I prefer it over Chakos  Food is what it is I mean its AYCE I'm not expecting good quality meat but its decent Overall this place is still my late-night goto for KBBQ"}
{"text":"I ordered a Chicken Lunchbox for takeout from the Korean Grill House and all the chickens are burnt. I am so disappointed for this $9.30 chicken with rice."}
{"text":"I actually really hate driving in Toronto for food esp on Queen St. Just be careful of where you park if you wanna eat around Korean Grill house and watch for parking signs.  We usually come to eat here for their night owl deal which I think is $17.99/pp pre tax and tip for fri-sun. Night Owl starts at 10pm till late at night. I think we left around 1am and it was still pretty crowded. We had a large group and made reservations. We couldn't sit all together because our group was 16 people so we were at 2 different tables which we didn't mind.   The servers were attentive and swung by often to check up on us and kept bringing pitchers of water. KBBQ will get you SUPER thirsty so drink a lot! The protein is brought in square trays and can get a little messy when you have a larger group. You just need to play tetris on your table.   The little apps are free and that is unlimited to order as well. My favourite of all time is the spicy bean sprouts! Not a regular customer here as I'm not in the city as often but I would be down to come once in a while! I get full really easily but I think I ate about $20 worth so I'm good with that."}
{"text":"The place was pretty good and very well-priced ($9.99 for an all you can eat lunch).  The pork was my favorite of the meats.  The main negative thing that I really have to say about this place is that the waiter consistently took a long time to bring out more food. I mean I know it's a business strategy, so that the food could settle and digest, and they can save more meat, but this place was a little over the top.  Like 10 minutes for another order of pork and a refill.   Another thing was that when I paid him the money, I have him $30 for a $24 meal (the six dollars was tip), but he never bothered to ask if it was tip, and he just disappeared into the back with the $6 for like 15 minutes, until we left, pretty unprofessional.   but food-wise, this is a decent Korean BBQ place, and definitely good for the price."}
{"text":"This was the first Korean grill house i've been to. Pretty cool experience but I will try a different place next time.  *I wouldn't say the service was bad but it was pretty cold.  *I ate upstairs. No music and the atmosphere is really plain.  Also, loud obnoxious bitches.  *The meat was delicious.  *i was shocked to see that i had to pay 13% gratuity. For what? Doing your job and bringing me the food I ordered? Or for grilling my own food? I work in the food industry and dont expect a tip. Thats NOT mandatory. Most people tip anyway. Make it mandatory doesnt make the customer want to tip you or return to your restaurant.  *Another ridiculous hidden fee. They now charge 1$ to use the debit machine.   Bottom line, get rid of the hidden fees and the ridiculousness. Paying 86$ for 2 people for what we ate was something I'm not doing again."}
{"text":"Sizzling chicken plate filled with cartilage and tiny bones ... not mentioned on the menu!"}
{"text":"We usually come here for their lunch specials with our extended families. We usually just get the bento box lunch specials as there are too many little kids in our families to do the \"grill your own food\" experience.  Lunch specials are dirt cheap, ranges from $5.99 to $8-9, comes with rice, bbq meat (chicken/pork/beef/salmon), a few cubes of fried tofu, bean sprouts and a milk tea or coffee. It is good value, however, the food is neither bad or good. It's mediocre. Service is consistently good and fast every time; we usually come for early lunch when the restaurant is not filled up yet.   We did the all you can eat grilling our own meat at dinner with friends once. It's standard just like all the other Korean BBQ places."}
{"text":"That's good and cheap. But I'm not really fan of it. The meat is really thin.  The good point is all the vegetables served with the meat and fish. I liked it :)  The place and the staff are really good."}
{"text":"All the kimchi and side dishes are made with a ton of sugar. No gochujang. The meat is sliced very thin and for good pork belly you do not want thin. This is not authentic korean, if you want authentic go elsewhere, if you want to fill up on all you can eat meat and only meat then go here. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Standard service and very cheap KBBQ. Not the best KBBQ, mind you, but good if you're not particularly picky about authenticity.   They charge more if you want more than your basic meats or vegetable. At one point, a server told me I was only allowed to change my grill once. I don't know if that was a legitimate rule this restaurant has set up, but I was displeased.   AYCE on a budget. That's why I'd come back."}
{"text":"Not very impressive at all. Service is sucky and very \"robotic\" as others have mentioned. I've had better Korean BBQ although this place comes recommended. They were out of prawns when we were there which was very disappointing especially since one person in our party was vegetarian. We also noticed there were small charges for every add on (salad, lamb, shrimp etc). The debit machine was down so we were doing things the old fashioned way to add up the bill way.  I would definitely not recommend nor will I be returning. So 2 stars for the salmon hot plate which was decent."}
{"text":"Mediocre all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ. It's still good tasting food (although quite salty) because it's just meat marinated with sweet teriyaki sauce. I particularly liked the pork, chicken, & beef. Calamari was really chewy and bland, while the fish wasn't too fresh.   Loved the sweet radish appetizer dish. While the Bean sprouts looked limp."}
{"text":"Korean Grill House is my go-to AYCE meats galore restaurant when I feel like a carnivore. I usually only go at night for the night owl deal at 12.99 which is cheaper than Chakos and totally worth it.   If you look at my past review of Chako, their service has been horrendous and their prices are so high, but at KGH I always, ALWAYS, have good/great service. Our water is always filled without even asking, our dishes were brung out promptly, any requests we ask they did, and near the end of our meal, many different servers asked us how was our meal and if we'd like to order anymore. At KGH it was a seamless experience and the food is marinated well and is super tasty as well.   My only down point is that whoever designed these tables is an smh! In a group of 5, we needed two burners but they only gave us 1. We stayed there for a long time because of how long it took to cook. It's also SUPER DEEP, and this is so annoying because we literally saw people standing up because they couldn't see almost a full half of their grill. Insanity. I don't think this will be fixed anytime soon, but it's not a deal breaker. They also charge 12% tip beforehand so make sure you're not overtipping.   All in all, love KGH and will definitely be back repeatedly. 4/5."}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying that this was our 5th choice down my list for Korean BBQ that had a grill in the middle of the table type of establishment as opposed to a place where they grill and bring it to you. I should have known something was up when we were able to make same day reservations on a Saturday. It was still pretty busy and we were seated upstairs, where it was very cold and all the extra overflow of people were seated. The stairs also seemed slanted, unsafe, and not leveled. I think they figured with all the cooking that the place would naturally get warm. All the Korean BBQ places that I have been to in Chicago have a special dipping sauce or paste for the bbq. There's usually lettuce for you to wrap it in as well. So none of that here, and that just led us to be stupefied and totally disappointed. Also they only give you 4 different banchan dishes, which was very underwhelming. I also had to ask for refills for that like 4 times since my family likes to have veggies with the meat. I suppose the prices are reasonable and the AYCE will have an appeal to those with large appetites. The service was a little slow as we always had to ask for things whether it was more water or banchan dishes. I figured I would take a shot with a 3.5 star Yelp reviewed place that would be a hit or a miss, and this was definitely a miss for me."}
{"text":"This was another great place that our Canadian fam took us.  This is the IT spot for Korean BBQ. I can see why the place is packed with customers and others who would squirm in to get a table on a busy night. For $13.95 (adult), all-you-can-eat menu, it includes pork, chicken, beef (kalbi short ribs/Bulgogi or marinated BBQ beef), ox tongue, ox liver, salmon, squid, and fish fillet. An extra $3 for lamb and shrimp. And an all-you-can drink for $1.95 (choice of juice/soda).   The food was phenomial! The service on the other hand was a different story. Our grill plate had to be changed at least 2-3x after all the charcoal clung onto the meats. The waiter was young, incompetent, and coped an extremely bad attitude. When we flagged him for water, meat, etc., he would literally mumble underneath his breath with a nasty expression. When we ordered a pitcher of ginger ale, he claimed they couldn't do a pitcher which was solely for juice or beer. When we asked for refills, viola, he came out with a magic pitcher to refill our cups. It would had saved him a load of work if he just served us the pitcher from the get-go. We had a different waiter who would tend to us since he kept disappearing.    Although, it's not an authentic Korean BBQ place, the food and concept is relatively the same. The joint is owned by Vietnamese staff. The place itself functions like a prep station similar to a factory: Flag the next customer and get them seated, carry out trays of all-you-can eat meats, refill their drinks, clean/wipe table, etc. It's apparent that the staff feels quite disgruntled since they are being overworked for meager wages. However, it's not an excuse for treating their customers poorly. Definitely try the Queens St location for friendlier service!"}
{"text":"Cheap late night meal but quality has gotten worse and the meat is very salty. Tried to give place this another try after a couple years and it is still disappointing. Pickled radish and carrots were old."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back! Very tasty.  When they ask if you want veggies beware. It's three dollars each I believe. So our table of four paid twelve dollars for one small plate of veggies. Make sure you really want them."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to tell people about this place because it was so delicious and don't want people to find out haha. The all you can eat literally is endless. Very tasty and the servers always made sure we had everything we needed. The meat was very flavorful especially the beef and short ribs.  The manger was very nice, but the other staff could use a brush up on their politeness. But I highly recommend this tasty place!"}
{"text":"K BBQ FTW! I frequent this location quite a lot. The night owl deal is pretty good. AYCE K BBQ for $12.99 after 10 pm.   This place isn't as fancy as CHAKO but honestly the food is about the same. CHAKO offers more variety and ice cream is included but it's always so busy, more expensive and parking there is insane.   The only way to get two burners here is to have more than 4-5 people. If you don't you'll have to slave over one BBQ and cooking food can take forever.   The place is quite small, but not tiny. Everytime I've been here, the staff has been kind and quick. Always checking up on us and refilling our drinks. They also bring out EVERYTHING we order, unlike other K BBQ places I've been to.   I probably wouldn't come here during its regular price times, but for the night owl deal it's a steal!   3/5 for me!"}
{"text":"I'd you're craving for BBQ meat but on a budget, then Korean Grill house is the place to be. It's all you can eat option will be your best bet. I usually only go for short ribs because it's marinated well but don't expect the best cuts as this is a place for quantity over quality. Meanwhile, service is decently fast however it can slow down if during peak hours, so keep that in mind as you may be surrounded by lots of students. Otherwise, Korean BBQ is a great experience for those that have never tried cooking their own good before. One last thing to mention, don't expect your clothes to smell nice because you WILL smell like Korean BBQ after leaving!"}
{"text":"Reserved a table for 5. Ordered 5 all you can eat meat plate for 5. I don't eat very much meat so asked for the vegetable plate. I received 1 ring of a green pepper, 2 small button mushrooms, 1 slice of onion, served on 2 wilted romain lettuce ribs. THATS It! Asked for more, got nothing. Got the bill I was charged for 5 orders of the vegetables. Pointed out to the served who ARGUED with us saying we were all at the table eating the meat platters, so therefore we all get charged for the veg plate. WTF? How did this make any sense? If we were to all have received a plate, of course this would reflect appropriately on our bill. So very disappointing and easily resolved but they had no interest in satisfying us. Our bill was $160... I can assure you they will not see our money again."}
{"text":"I've been told this isn't 'real' Korean BBQ. This could very well be the case, but it was delicious Korean food, and I BBQ'd it up right in the fire pit at my table, so, yeah, it's Korean BBQ. To me, at least.  I came in with my buddy for the AYCE meat menu -- $15 per person during normal supper hours, and it was grand.   I was partial to the pork, ribs and chicken but the marinade on the beef wasn't for me. Still, 3 out of 4 ain't bad... especially when it's all you can eat and you can keep ordering your faves. I also LOVE their fried tofu, and went back for 3 bowls of those bad boys.  To be honest I probably didn't eat $15 worth of meat, but my dining companion definitely ate at least $40 worth of meat, so it all worked out in the end.  MUST MENTION: If you've never cooked meat at your table in a restaurant you're missing out."}
{"text":"It is decent if you want AYCE BBQ. Definitely not authentic Korean BBQ but satisfied my cravings for grilled meats. Very expensive when u add on the lettuce option which they charge $3/person and everyone must get it. The side dishes are hit and miss, the meat is either too salty or bland. The restaurant can use a thorough cleaning especially the washroom (I did not go in because you can smell it when someone opens the door). Very unappetizing if u sit close to the washroom."}
{"text":"Bad quality meat, awkward seating and small grill, stupid kitchenware like rice bowls that tip over easily, plastic cups, side dishes that taste days old, crappy short tongs.  Never again"}
{"text":"I've had only the take-out, small portion and average taste for the price. Probably eat-in is fresher and better quality and portions."}
{"text":"Great reno.  clean, mordern and oh so nice dinning area.  Marinates on meat are really yummy.  Love the side dishes. Potato, kim chi, pickled carrots and leeks.    Prices are so reasonable compared to mississauga."}
{"text":"My friend and I totally thought this place was open at 11am and not 11:30am on Sundays. We were waiting outside the door like VULTURES.  I've been here many times before and have never had a bad experience. It is a 3 minute walk from the Osgoode subway station which is a bonus as I tend to take transit when visiting Toronto.  We were seated promptly and gotten our drinks with in 5 minutes. Our ayce Korean BBQ Sunday lunch included chicken, pork, beef, beef short ribs, ox liver, sausage, salmon, and squid. For $3 extra you can get veggies. But seeing as I am team Carnivore, I did not opt for veggies. You can now request which side dishes you want on the paper menu they provide. I was quite happy with this as I wanted ALL OF THE DAIKON :D  At one point we needed our grills changed and asked one of the waitresses to do so. She had all of her tools ready like a boss.  I enjoy this place and will visit again in the future."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service iv ever seen in the restaurant industry, the food is not bad i like it, but the servers are super unorganized and they are always forgetting what we ask for !! Do not recommend this place if you wanna have a great dining experience !!"}
{"text":"Everyone needs to experience a Korean Grill House at least once in there life!  I was always apprehensive of going to a place like this....cooking my own food? Excuse em moi? thats not why I wanted to dine out + raw meat and fears of salmonella and food poisioning kept me deterred . However my sister finally convinced to go plus she promised to cook all the food so I felt a little relieved.  We came on a Tuesday around 6pm and just 2 tables were filled however by the time we left the restaurant was packed. Definitely a good sign! The interior is very sleek and retro with white plastic chairs and tables full equipped with a frill in the centre.  For Drinks we ordered the Jasmine Green Tea. It came perfect temperature in a tall glass, not too hot and is very addictive. I lovedd it. Normally I don't like jasmine green teas as some places make it too fruity or floral but this was the perfect balance! Plus our waiter was super good and constantly refilling our glasses.  For Apps Deep Fried Dumplings - 3 pcs came golden brown and crispy surrounding a flavourful pork meatball.  Fried Spring Rolls- 3pcs again golden brown and super crispy average tasting but still good  For Mains Don't even look at the Dinner Menu Just order the ALL YOU CAN EAT MENU! It's totally worth it plus it'll work out cheaper then ordering separate meat items. They start you off with soup and bring over a bowl of rice and a whole bunch of sides such as different asian marianated vegetables. My favs were the sweet and sour radishes and spicy bean sprouts.  Then comes all the meat: -Pork *Loved -Beef * Loved -Chicken *Didn't try -Sausage *Loved -Beef Ribs *Good -White Fish *Good -Salmon *Good -Ox Tongue *Didn't try -Ox Liver *Didn't try -Squid *Didn't try  It was a lot of meat!! Next time I'll ask the waiter not to bring the items I didnt want to eat b/c I felt bad wasting them. Our waiter was really attentive clearing empty dishes and brining more meat and sides as we needed.  Finally for dessert  Green Tea Ice Cream - I think its possibly the best green tea icecream i've tried to date! Creamy and not too sweet with the green tea flavour still prominent. It was soooo good! Perfect ending to a fabulous meal.  I have to say after this experience I am a convert, no longer will I be scared to enter a Korean Grill House! Service was top notch, food was amazing and plentiful and don't forget to try the Jasmine Green Tea and Green Tea Ice cream for dessert!"}
{"text":"The food and KBBQ are quite good - it's not the greatest KBBQ I've had and most people can probably agree with this. My friends and I find ourselves always going back here because of the value. There is a \"Night Owl\" special here that begins at 10:00pm and goes until closing at midnight. For about $10-$12, you can have AYCE KBBQ. Personally, I only go here for the Night Owl special. Items in the Night Owl AYCE menu include:   - Protein: beef, chicken, squid, pork, fish - Veggies and sides: bean sprouts, spicy bean sprouts, kimchi, radish, tofu - Desserts: ice cream (green tea, mango, red bean) **I might have missed some items**  The food is decent for what you pay for. For the AYCE meals, the entire table has to get AYCE. I've been here a few times where they made some exceptions and others at my table didn't have to get AYCE.. but for the most part, the entire table has to get AYCE. The AYCE menu works through filling out small pieces of paper and handing them to the servers. You can fill out as many of these as you want. Desserts aren't on these sheets and can just be ordered through the server. I've never ordered the other non-AYCE items on the menu, but I assume they are of similar quality to the AYCE items.  In terms of the establishment, I personally don't find it the cleanest or the nicest. It's one of those establishments where I feel the need to wipe down my utensils and plates before eating (this might just be me!). The service is quite good here - no complaints with this.   *Random tip: you can ask to have your grill switched out when it gets too dirty. No additional charge."}
