{"text":"Would you like food with your salt?  Extremely overpriced and food is very high in salt. Service isn't the best either. Don't expect the same taste as the American chain.  Just close down already!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the call center ordering process.  We have ordered frequently in the past with no problems, in addition to dining in.   When we arrived to pickup this evening, no record of our order.  They blamed a change in how orders are handled.  No acknowledgement of our inconvenience.  That is disappointing from a customer service standpoint.  There are lots of choices out there.  It will be awhile before we make this choice again, even though we enjoyed our food when we finally got it."}
{"text":"it was the worst experience ever, cold nasty food, the worst service ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service is the worst I've ever seen from the Servers and the Runners. My server (Kevin) only spoke to our table from other guest's tables and while in transit (walking to the kitchen). It felt like he thought we had \"cooties\" or something. It was disappointing. Hosts seem well trained and kind. FOH manager (weekends/daytime) needs to check on his/her waitstaff."}
{"text":"Es gibt bessere PF Chang's aber auch hier war das Essen sehr lecker. Die Portionen waren in Ordnung, aber kleiner als in Florida. Das Ambiente ist wie in allen Restaurants der Kette toll. Der Service freundlich und fast immer schnell. Hat uns erneut gut gefallen."}
{"text":"I called to order take out and they told me they were out of fried rice and the ingredients. How does this happen? I guess a lot of people order this. Shorty order of supplies. She said once the order of supplies is gone it's gone."}
{"text":"Regularly eat at PF Changs and frequently have the Shrimp Dumplings pan fried. Last couple of times we have eaten at PF Changs and ordered the Shrimp Dumplings we noticed that they have changed how they make them. They used to have chunks of shrimp mixed in with the ground up shrimp filling. The texture and mouth feel and taste were all different in the past from what they are now. Kind of disappointed in this appetizer now. It is not being made the same way it used  to be made. Wondering if anyone else has  noticed this."}
{"text":"The introduction of a P.F. Chang's in Montreal is kind of a big deal. It's not as simple as a big box American chain restaurant setting up shop in my backyard, if the food is good, then I'm going to write about it.   I felt like it was my civic duty... my ethnic obligation, as a Chinese Montrealer whose roots run deep. This is why I decided to write about P.F. Chang's; my emotional attatcment to chinese community - 'authentic' chinese food is abundant around our city and this is how P.F.Changs is marketing their brand, they don't claim it to be the most 'authentic' in the land.   However, accessible, approachable and the bottom line is, this restaurant is a Chinese \"bistro\".  It appeals to a very distinct demographic of people, and that's ok; with ver 230 restaurants world wide, Mr. Philip Chang is obviously doing something right. For what it's worth, the food was tasty and decent... coming from a Chinese guy, who knows Chinese food, has been raised on Chinese food, eats Chinese food and Chinese food Chinese food."}
{"text":"I will never return to this location. The food wasn't fresh and the service was awful.  Our server seemed irritated that we ordered food.  She was unpleasant and made our night uncomfortable. This location needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"The only reason I had come this evening was to take advantage of a BOGO deal and it turned into a fairly frustrating evening.   To start, the service was really slow considering that there were only two other tables. Yes we came later in the evening than typical but we were not the last table to be seated and it shouldn't have been, at least, 10 minute intervals between seeing our server.  I had to remind my server of a cup of soup I ordered that was brought out after the entrees. I should have had them just take the soup off the bill since what they brought out tasted like it had been watered down to stretch it to last the remainder of the night. The short rib appetizer and the entrees were actually very good and tasty but it was not nearly enough to make up for the rest of my experience.  If you recall there were only two other tables and one of those happened to be wrapping up their meal at the same time as myself and my boyfriend. I reviewed the bill before placing my card for payment and waited, a fair bit, before the waiter came to grab it. After processing the payment and bringing back the bill I see that my amount was different, as was the items listed, and the name on the card inside. I notice that the table finishing up near by is filling out their bill and I send my boyfriend over to check to see if they have our card instead. Turns out they did.  Had I not been paying better attention then that other customer AND my waiter, some stranger would have walked out with my debit card, and I theirs. I get that sometimes things are crazy and waiters can get switched around, but this was two tables with plenty of wait time in between for the waiter. After realizing that this other person already filled my receipt out I proceeded to wait another almost 15 minutes before ANYONE resurfaced to help me out and fix it.  Needless to say I won't be going back since this place can't be trusted to be on top of their game on a super slow, weekday night."}
{"text":"Went to PF Changs for lunch last Saturday.  I don't normally complain but the service we had here was horrendous!  We were 3 and the restaurant wasn't busy as it had opened just 30 minutes prior. When we arrived, were seated fairly quickly but we waited quite awhile before our server came to our table. We were ready to order when he came but he just took our drink orders and walked away when I said we'd like to order now. 15 minutes later, we tried to flag down the server and we  we did, he said:\"Let me first get the drink.\" Another ten minutes go by and he shows up with the wrong order. He brought two coffees, instead of one, and we say:\" it's ok, we will keep it.\"  The server then walked away. We then realize that the \"coffee\" is more like dirty dishwasher, only one long teaspoon was given for the coffees and there was dried, caked on red velvet cake encrusted on the teaspoon. The cream had also curdled. Our server was no where to be found. We managed to flag down another server and at this point we would have left had we not been with our 78 year old aunt who was hungry. We explained the situation to the other server and she said (no apology or anything):\" Let me get another coffee.\" So she just drops it off with no other word said. When we finally get our food, it's decent and nothing to write home about. At that point, we were still just turned off that the server never came back to even ask us how the drink was....or the food for that matter. When it came time to leave, we waited for  good 15 minutes before I could flag down the server to get our bill. Another ten minutes go by and I get up to pay at the cash. The woman says I have to go back to the table and wait, so I do; for another 10 minutes.  In short, the worst meal, with the worst service ended up costing 75 for the \"lunch special\" and we will never step foot in that restaurant again."}
{"text":"Okay this place is perfect. My favorite place. The food is always outstanding and the service is always great. I've never had a rude server. The food is kind of expensive but we go occasionally because the food is just so good.  We are going tonight on a double date, they've never gone before so they must try it!  My favorite meal is sweet and sour chicken :)"}
{"text":"I thought the Great Wall of Chocolate dish at PF Changs was really good. I shared with six other members of my family and we still couldn't finish it. It's huge. It's really sweet but for all you chocolate lovers, I bet you'd love it. I thought that this chocolate cake was one of the best cakes I've had; it had a chocolate sort of cream in between the slices.   I also enjoy eating the mini desert of The Great Wall of Chocolate if I can't finish a whole serving of the gigantic cake at one time. This small amount is the right serving for not having enough chocolate and having too much chocolate. It's just right. Other restaurants don't serve this portion of a dessert, which makes it cool in a way and different.   I love the to go containers they have for the left over cake. I could eat the rest of my cakes for three days after I had it. It was like a never ending chocolate fantasy.   The prices are fairly reasonable for the amount of cake I got . They could go down a little bit but there's three days worth out of that cake so I can't complain too much. The price for the mini dessert is cheap but could be lowered as well because of the small portion given.   This dessert is, by far, the best dessert on the menu. I've tried the banana spring rolls and the New York style cheesecake; they're pretty good but when I'm in the mood for chocolate, these two dishes don't compare. I don't think they have the same creamy texture and they're not the same size as the Great Wall of Chocolate. They're tiny compared to the chocolate cake.  Anyone, who goes to PF Changs, needs to try this dessert. It's a must on the menu. Nothing compares to it."}
{"text":"Went to the Chandler location of PF Changs for an early New Years Eve dinner with a group of 4 couples.     We all ordered the \"dinner for two\".  Soup (had the hot and sour- very good!) then lettuce wraps (good as usual).  Unfortunately, when the entree arrived, the restaurant was unable to provide rice for several orders.  The official word was \"ran out- cooking more\".   3 couples were shorted rice. We waited a bit, but then started eating our cooling main dishes. After reminding the server  that rice never came out, we suggested to forget it, and just adjust the bill somehow.  Our server was very huffy and hostile and ignored that. She insisted that rice was coming.  A bit later she brought out some rice.  The main dishes were already eaten.  Pointless.  No apology-  She merely wanted to know if we wanted to take the rice home.       Guess we could have insisted on talking to a manager, but didn't bother.   Disappointed in the server's \"tough cookies\" attitude.  How does a restaurant \"run out\" of a key dinner component at 6 p.m.?"}
{"text":"PF chang does not serve real Chinese food, they serve American Chinese food. It is different thing. Typically American Chinese food does not require a lot of skill to do it. Unlike authentic Chinese cuisine which requires a lot of skill and time to cook.  The problem is PF chang does not even know how to cook a simple dish. I have had the worst roast duck in PF Chang, house special pork rib was aweful. I don't understand how they can screw up such simple dish. My wife and I can make better dish than them. Price is way too expensive. I can easily find a bundle of Chinese restaurant better than PF Chang around Phoenix area. Sigh"}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT !  I have NEVER had a bad meal here and would HIGHLY recommend ! Changs is a weekly meal for our family! Bar none, best bang for your buck! LOVE LOVE LOVE !!"}
{"text":"Yackkk! I would never recommend. If you're going to a chinese restaurant better go at china town instead coz this place sucks. Food is disgusting and pricey for nothing. Never ever going back!"}
{"text":"We've been to this location many times.  Food was always great.  The service this time was mediocre at best.  Waiter forgot a drink order and the food took unusually long to come out. It was a little busy and we waited patiently for our food. Waiter never acknowledged us to let us know food was coming or kitchen was taking a while..  Nothing. The male manager asked how everything was and we let him know the food was taking a little longer than usual...  When the food finally came out,  we  simply asked the Waiter to pack the food to go,  we were ready to leave at this point. We were not mean or rude about it,  we were just ready to go. Manager came over and had the NERVE to say,... \"it's not a buffet,  we do have to cook the food\" Seriously!?!?  Totally rubbed us the wrong way... Never ever going here again... NEVER!!"}
{"text":"I love pfchangs in toronto, buffalo ny and las vegas so i was looking forward to the montreal location. I have been here a few times since its been opened either with groups of friends or my husband. The 2nd time i came, one of my friends found a ladybug in her salad. They offered us free drinks but no comp to the meal. My husband had to negotiate that even though it was clearly an error on their part. I had been back twice since then and the food was good. The last time however in march it was terrible. I ordered salt and pepper prawns which were below average - if you ask me it tasted like 2 day old chinese food. It is my fav thing on the menu to order so i know what its supposed to taste like. When i sent it back to the kitchen they had the nerve to send it back to me saying if they remake it, it will taste the same! I was shocked! The waitress was apologetic but the damage was done. I will never ever come back to pfchangs in montreal again. They need to see how food is served in their other locations. Signed very disappointed foodie"}
{"text":"They need to clean the place up. Front entrance and door filthy. Also the candle holders on the tables saw better days. Food was fine. Too spicy even though they toned it down. PFC on Superstition nicer."}
{"text":"I am so very impressed!  having recently discovered an unfortunate gluten intolerance (boooooooooooo, especially due to a lifetime of carb-lover syndrome), I have to be more selective about where and what I eat.  lame.  anyway, my girlfriend and I dined at P.F. Chang's last night, and we were greeted by a terrific host (who was terrifically funky), and had a terrific server who was very attentive to our needs AND new all about the gluten-free items on the menu, down to the sauces!!!  she even brought me out a special sauce.  Chang's offers a GLUTEN-FREE menu on the back - this is so awesome!!!  I cannot tell you how much I appreciated that.  And, the selection is widespread, so you're not limited to a few things with this setback.  I had the Fried Rice with Shrimp, and it was delicious, and definitely affordable.  The ambience is really nice, the drink menu looks interesting (though a little pricey), and there is plenty of seating  Because I spent a great deal of my younger life in the service industry, I fully appreciate having great service, because I was a great server - and this means a lot to the customer!  You can tell that P.F. Chang's really emphasizes the value of service.  Kudos!!  Will definitely be back, and will definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Only reason to visit PF Changs is the Pan Fried Pot Stickers. Not a big fan of the recent menus changes."}
{"text":"Vegan's and Vegetarian's beware! The waiter we had asked the manager to give us a menu so we could make an informed decision... It took over 15 minutes to get the print out and he did not even give us vegetarian options just NO MILK NO EGG that was not helpful as the sauces may not be vegetarian, and there were chicken options on the print out he gave us!  When we asked him a question about the menu like can we have the spicy asparagus he said: \"well is it allergy or a dietary option?\" He did not want to help us and he seemed bent out of shape to help us fine something to eat! We had veggie lettuce wraps that We order before we had the print out menu, so went somewhere else to eat!  They have no idea what's in anything and they don't want to help you if you have special dietary needs! I will never be  back to the Chandler location... as the there manager is terrible!"}
{"text":"I just want to say thank you to the Management and staff, especially Amy for their fantastic service and wonderful meal.  Let me explain how wonderful they were...we took our 87 year old grandmother out to eat.  She loves the egg-drop soup and lettuce wraps.  When she picks the lunch spot, PF Changs is her place of choice! As we walked to the door pushing the wheel-chair, Amy, who turned out to be our waitress, politely opened the door and helped us to our table.  She was patient with our order and pampered us the entire time.  Amy cheerfully completed all our requests and even went overboard.  The food was well prepared, great portion sizes and straight from the kitchen to our table in amazing time!  Yes we enjoyed grandma's favorites as well as a couple of ours!  When it was time to leave, as if Amy hadn't bee fantastic already, she boxed our leftovers and spoiled grandma with several extra fortune cookies, just to make sure she got a good fortune.  Then she suggested we use the side entrance from the patio, which gave us a straight shot to the handicap parking spots and kept grandma out of the sun.  We really enjoy the food from Changs, but Amy really made our visit!  Thanks Amy, for everything!"}
{"text":"Its great for a big familly. . But personaly for chinese food id go to china town ;) its very American ish .. its good but like I said its not a place I would crave to fo back to.. we go every now and then because the seatings are wonderful and for a big family its perfect. Its a bit pricey. The soups are delish there and the drinks are cool."}
{"text":"There are definitely a lot of other places with better Chinese food. Not only by quality but by quantity as well for what you're paying."}
{"text":"Affordable eatery and the food tastes pretty good too. Changs Spicy Chicken is pretty good though the Hot and Sour soup could go easy on the sodium. Dimly lit interior fits in with the whole vibe and style of cuisine. Pretty friendly waiting staff and the service is above average. Lots of drinks to choose from. PF Changs is a nice establishment to venture to every few months."}
{"text":"My hubby and I LOVE, LOVE the salt and pepper prawns. We always get them  and spicy green beans.  Well, today is our 52nd anniversary,  no typo,  52 years with the same person.  Anyway, we love to go and indulge.  The food was excellent,  and today we splurged with apple Chai cobbler w/icecream.  The manager stopped at our table to chat.  We told him of our special day and he congratulated us. Then to our SURPRISE, he brought Prosecco and 2 glasses for  us to celebrate.  That was wonderful enough.  Then, when the check came,  the cobbler was noted as complimentary.  Unbelievable!  Our #52 is one we will always remember because of the manager's  kindness.  Thank you again!  And we will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"The food is always so very good! Sometimes the service not. Love going here as one of my favorite cravings! My favorite thing to order is the Crispy Green Beans! I could eat the whole appetizer by myself. Other favorites for something kind of light is the Shrimp and Honeydew dish. Or for something spicy, the Eggplant. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"This location has never let me down. The management here is on point. There is always at least one manager walking the floor and even helping out with water refills, leading by example because every server is selfless and even when they are swamped they still all help each other out and make sure diners are taken care of."}
{"text":"P.F. Chang's offers a nice selection of vegetarian fare that I have been consuming since my switch to vegetarianism last year. Its been good for my family as well since they all eat meat. My husband and I can get what we like, they can get what they like, everyone leaves happy.  My favorite dishes are the vegetarian lettuce wraps and the spicy eggplant. My husband prefers the ma po tofu and the vegetable curry. We also like to get take out. Did you know that you can order those little mini deserts to go? Ya, I found that out a few weeks back and ordered four of them. They are pretty good.   Beware though, P.F. Chang's food is extremely high in sodium. So if you have high blood pressure or something, you should probably eat somewhere else. Otherwise you might die. But for those of you who don't care about your sodium intake, they have a warrior card you can sign up for online and get 10% off every time you eat here. You even get emails sometimes with 20% off coupons."}
{"text":"Like anything I ever had there.  Never had a problem with my food.  The help was always friendly.  Went on Mother's Day and the service was as good as any other day."}
{"text":"It was not too bad. I expected to be embarrassed by the food because I am from the same culture and sometimes American take on Chinese is not too good. But I did really like the quality of food they presented. I also liked the kind of chic decorations.   The big horse out front really was interesting.  I also liked the piña colada ;)    Service wasn't all that great. Kind if slow and a little cold as far as personality goes.   But I would be back."}
{"text":"The food is good. I have been 4 times and the service has always been horrible. 20 minutes to get a diet coke after having to call the manager. This is the last time I am going there."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences that I've had in the area. The servers are incredibly pleasant and welcoming. The food is delicious! And when they accidentally threw away my leftovers, they offered to make me another dish to take home! Wonderful wonderful people."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service sucked. The waiter pretty much was nonexistent. He did manage to bring me a Diet Coke when I asked for dr. Pepper. I guess I should just be grateful I at least got a drink."}
{"text":"I went yesterday and sat the bar. It was busier than I thought it would be. My food was good and surprisingly I ate all of the chicken. I'll probably visit again in 3-4 months. On this visit I redeemed a free entrée reward, so I saved a few bucks."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Temperature...warm Not what you'd expect when eating at the location. Price too high for what you get. Waited long time to go there & now.. will not be going back. Really not worth it!!"}
{"text":"Ok,......for a chain. I try to support local business as much as possible. Pricey, good for a date night I guess."}
{"text":"Lunch for 4. Food was good. Went with the duck and a few other top plates. Service was better in Laval. More friendly. So, Laval for lunch... approved. Always more fun to eat at PFC in a group, to sample more dishes."}
{"text":"I really like p f changes but wish they would us smaller younger green beans for their crispy green bean appetizer. They are good but too big and tough. Good dipping sauce tho."}
{"text":"Service was excellent.Food tasted great and loved the ambience.Was hungry enough to eat Madagascar lemur.(pun to other review) lol My fortune cookie was horrible and a terrible liar of my fortune! Lol"}
{"text":"If you have over 2 people plan on waiting over 2hrs for a table. If you happen to ask for a manager don't count on ever speaking with one. You are an inconvenient burden that pays their bills."}
{"text":"Background:  I have wanted to try this restaurant since they 1st opened, and the rumor of their prohibitivly expensive food is what kept me away for this long.  Since it was Father's Day, and one of my daughters wanted to help defray the unethically high cost, I agreed to finally try.  Service:  Friendly, warm, and usually nonexistent.  There were 4 times out of 10 table visits where the waitress was unexplainably missing for over 15 minutes.  It took us over 110 minutes to get out of this restaurant-- we just kept waiting for the server.  I can also say that whenever she did arrive, she had a plastered-on smile, a soothing voice, and pretended to be attentive to our every need.  It's tough have a good family experience with her kind of ungenuine performance.  Price:  Unnecessarily expensive, and horribly overpriced.  Food from Pei-Wei (at cheaper prices) is easily comparable to these dishes.  Most of the entrees were $15-25, so this can only be a family restaurant for special occasions.  They will easily miss the entire market of routine family meals, because of their ridiculously high prices.  Please stop creating restaurants with price lists like this.  Taste:  The food was wonderful, and exactly what I'd expected.  I also would expect a 10-out-of-10 taste of food for this kind of money.  The portions were enough for a 2nd meal later, so this part was A-OK.  In summary, we won't be back.  My 1st impression when we sat down was that it sounded as loud as a cafeteria.  The concrete floors must have echoed the sound of all the diners clinking their silverware and talking needlessly loud in the dining room.  We will archive this visit in the family history and refer to it as, \"...remember the time we went to P.F. Changs?\".  I've enjoyed Wolfgang Puck's shows, advice, and attitude, but the prices are too prohibitive for any type of return trip.  I'm kind of stunned that they would pin their future hopes of success on the hope that another 1st time visitor will keep this restaurant going."}
{"text":"Whenever I go here I feel like everyone knows a secret about this place that I don't. The food isn't Asian in any meaningful sense, and it isn't particularly good in general. So why is it packed out and the dishes so relatively expensive? I just had the new Lemongrass Prawn, which was pretty good as far as that goes, but not even remotely Chinese. The fake Asian decorations are more annoying to me than anything, and the dim ambience is destroyed by the TVs playing at the bar since they can be seen from just about every table in the restaurant. The general pretense of classiness was ruined for me when I went to the bathroom only to find spanish profanities written all over the stall. Someone in my party was served the wrong dish, and it took a while for us to get the right one. We were mistakenly given an appetizer which we had not ordered. Clearly, the serving system is incapable of handling a full restaurant. I also saw people being moved to different tables to make way for other, larger parties. I understand the business sense, but that's a completely classless move. Our server was very friendly, but rushed us out as soon as we were done eating. Bland food, poor service, long waits, and high prices? I'll pass."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre as is the service. The decor is nice. I was very disappointed with the lunch special - no appetizer or dessert and the portion was tiny!! I had the sweet and sour chicken lunch bowl and there were max 4 small pieces of chicken. I left the resto still hungry :( I was hoping there would be more fortune cookies to supplement my meal but alas I got only one!"}
{"text":"Nice place. New and clean. Not impressed with the food. Overpriced and overrated. Probably wont go back. Very small portions and very salty. I've been to regular places like wok cafe which is very simple, very affordable and very tasty. Dont be fooled by the valet. I shouldnt have to ask for water when the table is spending about $3000. I ask for water and the waiter only brings a glass for me. Not for anyone else."}
{"text":"Man..Is it me or has this place gone down hill or what. It's just not the same.  Ordered a dessert and coffee from the bartender and he sighed and said \"It's going to be a wait on the coffee...maybe 10 minutes or so..\"  Seriously?  Told him to just forget the Coffee..and then boom...the Coffee appears in like 30 seconds.. ..Before the actual dessert...Weird.  Guy seemed super stressed out. Still like this place..hope they get things sorted out."}
{"text":"We went for a mother's day dinner, The hostess and \"manager\" was very arrogant and unprofessional, very poor service. We'll definitely not go back, you feel that the restaurant is managed by a bunch of people who really don't care about customer service"}
{"text":"I visit this location only twice and the reason I give this place 2 stars is because the first time that I've been there was exactly very nice: great food, great service. Just like you would expect in a dissent restaurant. The second time was awful!!!! If it was my only time there I wouldn't even give this restaurant 1 star if I could. The waiter was seems like his having a really bad day or he just didn't like me and my friend for some reason. At first his recommendation for the food was pretty flat and he couldn't explain any dish that had \"traditional taste\"  in his opinion. Now yes I do get that sweet&sour or orange peel chicken is very popular in Chinese kitchen but it has nothing to do with his attitude that evening. He was rude, uninformative and always speak super fast and ran immediately off the table when he was done talking (and no the place wasn't packed at all). Me and my friend were complaining that the time we were waiting to get our entrees was too long and my friend mention that we are in a hurray. Then first we couldn't find our waiter for a while so we spoke with couple of different  waiters to check for the food. When our waiter came by with his \"cheerful\" mood he decided that we didn't informative him that we are in a hurry and we are not waiting long enough. By the time It came it was 40 min from the time we order. I think 40 min it's a lot of time to wait for a fish and chicken. Even with the starters the gap between the courses was just too long and if the kitchen is on pressure at least the person that serves the food should be nice!! I told one of the employee about my experience that evening and he said \"he will tell the manger\". also explained him that I go to restaurants 3 times a week and I've never had such a bad experience in my life. When I finally ended my visit before I got out I asked from the host for a pen so I could sign my visa because the waiter was \"too busy\" too remember to bring one.  I told her that I hope the other waiters are nicer but she couldn't care less. This is my very first time I didn't tip a waiter, if that's how I felt after this visit I feel that I need to share my experience.  The only thing I can do is saying that the \"traditional\" sweet & sour chicken was tasty. And I would have come back for some more if I'll get treated better."}
{"text":"The typical chain restaurant. This is to Chinese what Olive Garden is to Italian. Except that Olive Garden is a better value for money. Ambience and service are very good. Food is okay. I wouldn't particularly recommend it for vegetarians."}
{"text":"This is a Chinese bistro, with a mix of Asian foods, mostly Chinese, but not intended to be authentic. There are some good things and some bad things. The service was fine, if not a bit slow to collect money at the end. The calamari was excellent. The orange chicken had too much of an orange flavour in the end. They delivered six sauces to the table, but there was never any attempt to explain them or introduce their usage at all. Sort of drop a plate on the table and do what you need to do with them."}
{"text":"Its been quite a while since I've been back to PF Changs, but our server, Brittany was great last night! Very friendly and easy to communicate with. My tofu lettuce wraps were wonderful! Not enough vegetarian options without making things complicated though.. Otherwise great dinner and will return.  :)"}
{"text":"Four stars because the food and atmosphere was everything a Changs is suppose to be and it gets an extra star because our server Krystal was excellent and super attentive even though she was super busy. Great experience."}
{"text":"We used to go to PF Chan's once a year or so, back in California. The meal was always good and we enjoyed ourselves. I told my husband I was craving Chinese food and this is where he took me. I was pretty excited.  We were seated promptly, and we were asked our drink order right away. I was having trouble deciding on our meal (we always share) and the waitress (SUPER NICE) started on the egg rolls for us. When I finally decided on our Chang's spicy chicken, I called the waitress over, and she told me one second. she came back right away with our egg rolls. They were delicious!!! defiantly the best part of the meal. we waited a little while then got our chicken. When deciding what to order, I had mentioned to the waitress that I didn't want anything too spicy, and she advised against the kung pao chicken, and said the Chang's chicken won't be too spicy. It was pretty freaking spicy!! I couldn't imagine how spicy the kung pao chicken would be. They knew we were splitting the meal, so they separated the rice into two bowls for us. The presentation of the chicken was pretty lack luster.... it didn't look special, just chunks of chicken in an orangish sauce, and it tasted about as good as it looked unfortunately..... The only reason I am giving this two stars is because of our waitress. She was very personable and nice, but her positive attitude did not make up for the meal that we paid $25 for. it was worth $10 at most. Very disappointed. I guess we will just have to go back to the one in California next time we are there."}
{"text":"This was our third time at P F Chang's this year and we were disappointed. The hot and sour soup was terrific, but our favourite Mongolian beef was overcooked, chewy and dry. The orange peel chicken was quite good and we enjoyed the mini desserts. Our friend found his kung pao chicken also dry and as it was his first time at the restaurant he did not think he would be coming back. A dish of turkey tartare was judged outstanding and enjoyed by us all. Too bad."}
{"text":"What the heck happened to PF Changs?  They used to be one of the best Chinese food places around!  Wife and I went there a few weeks ago and both vow to never return.  Her food had zero spice mine had double...had to send it back...after a 30+ minute wait on it the first time then another 15 the second."}
{"text":"I used to go to this PF Changs all the time when I lived nearby. It was always good. I always got the same thing... Kung Pao with chicken. I loved it! Well they must have changed something because this time it was awful! The chicken was different... almost soggy in spots. And the sauce is not the same. Super bland, not much spice. I started to wonder if I got a different dish by mistake but I didn't. And the lettuce wraps.... BLECH! Pretty sure all that was in it was chicken fat. I used to work at Pei Wei and I know those are lower quality than PF Changs. But I'm pretty sure they took a page from Pei Wei and used all the yucky parts of the chicken. Service was also pretty slow for not being that busy. Overall super disappointed!! Won't be back."}
{"text":"A monthly staple of our eating habits the food is consistent, hot, usually quickly served and the drinks affordable. PF Chang's is however not an inexpensive night out. For a party of two with apps and drinks as well as your main course one should expect to shell out a quick $80-100. The early bird apps and drink specials can tame this some and soften the blow. Plan ahead as the place fills up quickly.   My only negative comment would be the extensive \"dust bunnies\" behind the bar on the ceiling. Someone needs to look at the big picture a bit more and stay on top of things."}
{"text":"They fail at carryout. Always an issue. Something forgot or timing issues. I do love gluten free options and dined at bar once and service was much better."}
{"text":"Definitely not a sushi or seafood person, but had to go here for a big family dinner and was surprised at how good it was! I don't like some of the food just because I don't, it's as simple as that, but for the most part the food was great! I got the beef and broccoli and surprisingly it was DELICIOUS! I ate all of the beef and broccoli and loved the sauce it came with! I also ate some of my families food and like it too! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is great and I frequent here often. The pot stickers are the best and the service at the bar is always quick and friendly. Drinks are strong and you cant beat the portion size. Priced well also"}
{"text":"Very yummy, I had the pepper steak, had a kick to it. Would recommend! Nice and fancy place, very chill vibes. A lot of booth seating"}
{"text":"Yes, I am a fan of Pf Changs. I love coming here and when I do, never disappointed. Despite the harsh critics out there claiming it's not \"real\" asian food, well have you actually had real asian food? I like to consider this asian food with an american flare. Who cares, as long as it's good, I don't care who cooks it! This place is fun to go to, I enjoy the ambiance of it, I enjoy their mixed drinks and I really enjoy their food. Oh and if you haven't had the calamari, the best!!"}
{"text":"This particular location changed their happy hour seating policy. So if u are here for happy hour, you will have to seat at the Phoenix heat patio or at the bar!  This policy does not make sense if the inside capacity is only 10%!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to PF Chang's in quite some time.  I was craving Chinese cuisine, some spicy chicken dish was on the mind.  There are very few, if any, gluten free or gluten friendly Chines Cuisine restaurants in the Mesa area.  We started with the lettuce wraps... WOW!  I forgot how good they are!  Nice and clean, crispy.  Easy to enjoy.  And the sauce is just fantastic.  I ordered the gluten free Spicy Chicken and it was EXACTLY what I was craving.  I had enough for lunch today!  I will definitely be back.  When I asked for more sauce for the chicken, they brought a nice, big bowl at no extra charge.  No roll of the eye.  Just simple, kind service... a dying art these days.  Our waiter was very kind.  The manager checked on us once.  Overall, fabulous night!"}
{"text":"Look, I know there are things are the menu that are better than others. And at first about 10 years ago when they opened I wasn't that crazy about them. But now, their menu has really improved. The cucumber salad is incredible. The side veggies are fantastic. It always tastes the same. No surprises. That's good."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a bunch of friends. There were eight of us on a busy Thursday night. We got sat right away with our reservation. The food was a axing as always. I highly recommend the hot fish! And our server (forgive me for not remembering his name) was probably the service I have ever gotten! He was very quick and precise. He took care of us with our drinks and refilled when needed. Bagged our food for us and even kept up on clearing the table with our empty dishes. Again the best service I have got in a very long time! Thank you for a wonderful evening with my friends!"}
{"text":"Okay, this is another instance where I officially state that I don't often go to chain restaurants and then go home and rate them a 4-Star only because most of my experience are usually 3-Stars.  Also, I'd like to clarify that I am giving this rating based on service and not necessarily on food, though the food was on par and as expected.  We had a great time at PF Changs today... only reason we went here was because my sis was craving \"chinese\".  Anyway, our server J was awesome and so was the manager (with whom we had a lengthy, funny, conversation about burgers, of all things).  The food was as expected but I was mostly impressed w/ our server who, when I told him in a joking manner that I might start gnawing on his arm because I was so hungry, he said, \"give me a sec\" and ran back to the kitchen and had them whip up our meal pronto.  It came out quickly and everything except the Buddha's feast was exactly as ordered.  Our server was not a fake friendly guy, he was just real though friendly, funny, and quick.  He didn't do any of that annoying interrupting stuff (I hate that, esp when you're in a deep conversation with someone and they interrupt you to ask if you want water.. yes, it's empty 'cuz I've been suckin' it down so please go for it) and walked by often enough so that if we needed something, we could grab him easily.  My martini (Dragon something or other) was pretty good, though a bit too sweet for my taste to order again.  My eggplant was really good (then again I was really hungry).  But like I said, our server was great and provided the kind of service that makes you want to come back because it's rare to find.  Yeah.. I know, I wasn't expecting that at all.  Also, they had a decently sized Gluten Free offerings for those with Gluten allergies - that's great to find!"}
{"text":"Average Chinese-American restaurant. As far as service goes, I live next door and gotta say this store cannot compare to the one in Vegas. The staffs here are not as friendly and enthused."}
{"text":"Certainly not the best Chinese in town, however it is a very nice place to go out on a date or a long day at work. It is fancy and a bit over priced. It is clean and it has good service and management. Food is acceptable but price-wise is overrated.   If you have kids then it is good for you."}
{"text":"A family style restaurant with an amazing staff and great food! I really enjoyed their beef and broccoli and shrimp appetizer. You can't really go wrong when the meal ends with a yummy fortune cookie! :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this PF Chang's a lot.  I have not had one issue with the food or service.  It always seems to be consistent.  I had the lo mien with chicken.  It was pretty good.  We did order a side of the fried rice too.  I will say it was okay and stick to the brown rice next time.  I tried their strawberry shortcake and thought was good."}
{"text":"I had such a lovely evening, with delicious food and great company. It is super cool that they have vegetarian and gluten free options, I am definitely a fan of that.  The server was extremely personable & very knowledgeable about the menu. I started off with a Key Lime Pie cocktail,  it was really sweet so I wouldn't do more than one or two but definitely worth a try. For the appetizer I did the Gluten-Free Chicken Lettuce Wraps and for my entree the Gluten-Free Lemon Chicken. Both were very delectable and I would definitely recommend both dishes. Unfortunately I was too full to get dessert this time, however if you go just for dessert only or have room for something sweet I would recommend the Banana Spring Rolls.  Side note about this particular location: it is a very busy and the wait times can get a bit ridiculous.  If they accept call ahead seating/reservations I would definitely recommend it, or just go at an odd time of day."}
{"text":"I've been to this PF Chang's location more times than I can count. The food is always good, and usually the service is also fine.  Today, we went for lunch with a group of 10 after our bowling league.  After telling the server twice very early on that we would need separate checks for 4 couples and 2 individuals, she couldn't seem to manage the task adequately.  Several of the checks were incorrect, and it was at least 1/2 hour for us to pay our bills.  She apologized profusely, but I didn't think that was adequate.  I don't know if this was a training issue, computer problem, or maybe we should have called a manager over.  I will be back with one or two other people because I like the food, but our group has decided to skip this location for lunch in the future."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Host and manager very accomadating. Prices are on par with food. Our server, Keith, was wonderful. We were starving so he took our order immediately. We asked for extra sauces, both kinds of rice, and a lot more and he delivered it all with an unreluctant smile. This is not the closest location to my house but it will be the location I return to next."}
{"text":"Same consistent good food and we had really good service this go around. What can I say, it is PF Chang's. This location serves up the same food and menu items you are used to. We did the lunch menu this time which is offered on Saturdays until 4:00pm in addition to the normal weekly menu. It is plus if you would rather have your own sized portion vs sharing a larger portion."}
{"text":"Let's get straight to my wife and a I ordered orange peel chicken, chicken lo mein, chicken fried rice, and veggie spring rolls. The orange peel chicken was just ok but it was chicken breast so that's a plus, the low mein was good wasn't too strong a flavor, fried rice was good as well not too much soy sauce not too little just right, the veggie spring rolls were not to my liking there were some pretty big chunks of cabbage in them flavor was ok though. The biggest PLUS for this establishment is the service it was perfect, got our refills without being too intrusive, we weren't bothered every minute about how the food is while we're still eating. Our server even removed a shrimp dish from our bill that we didn't like."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with PF! I'm weird when it comes to Asian and this place is consistently good!   For apps I love the chicken lettuce wraps and the green beans ( small size is enough for two)! Main dish I always bounce between the veggie lo mein ( LOTS of veggies good crunch) and the crispy honey chicken! Main entree portions are big so my BF and I usually always split!   For drinks I tried the red sangria, eh it was ok I tasted a weird after taste that my BF said was prob the orange in it --for 9.50$ eh I wouldn't get it again personally.  What I like best about PF Chang Is the constancy in my dishes and I have always gotten great service!"}
{"text":"I came here involutarily with a group of 10 for a family birthday celebration. Not my side of the family, of course, but it's one of the sacrafices you make when you get married.  To psych myself up, I got there early to catch the tail end of happy hour. I was decently impressed with the black tea gimlet. It was served in a coupe glass, and the St. Germain made it sweet and smooth.  I ordered the Buddah's Feast steamed because I didn't want to deal with the usual 5 pounds of water weight gain that comes from consuming quadruple the RDA of sodium in one meal.   When our food was brought out, there was lots of confusion. The two servers started auctioning off our food, yelling down the table. One of the meals was wrong, and three other entrees came in its place. My entree was no where to be seen. I'm surprised they dropped the ball so badly. I thought part of the reason you eat at a souless, corporate grubateria was to experience a well-oiled machine that is able to execute orders correctly and efficiently. Splitting the checks was also a bumpy, drawn out experience.  Hopefully, I won't have to come here again."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with P.F. Chang's! We went on Sunday at 7pm and the rush was starting to die down. The hostess was friendly and took us to our table as soon as we walked in.   The dining area is big but the tables feel super crammed together. I was literally rubbing backs with the lady sitting behind me. My friend who sat in front of me could literally taste the cologne the customer behind her was wearing. Tables are waaaay to close to each other, ugh.   Our waiter come out right away, introduced himself, and took our drink orders. We knew what we wanted, so we placed our entree orders right away.   We ordered:   Chang's spicy chicken noodle soup a side of asparagus  Glazed salmon Shrimp with lobster sauce  and white rice  As always the soup was delicious. It can be spicy for those who don't eat spicy food! The asparagus are to die for! They were crunchy and were seasoned just right! The salmon was a first for us on that night, and it was very good! We always order the shrimp with lobster sauce as it is one of our favorites!  The waiter was attentive and very friendly! We did order our food right when we got there, and for some reason it took forever. We literally waited close to an hour. Parties who had arrived after us were getting their food before we did. I had never waited that long for food at any P.F. Chang's. The server did come around and apologize for the wait..   Sign up for their rewards program! You get pretty cool perks!   Service was good and so was the food, even though it took ages for it to cone out."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars!  I have always liked P.F. Chang's.   The food is delicious.  The appetizers from their famous lettuce wraps to their salt & pepper calamari.  Nicely lit - dim yet, easy on the eyes - brings comfort to a very loud place.  Not a romantic place.  More on a good place to eat out once in a while with a fun group of friends and family - and I now have my parents doing take out on occasion.  They are good to hook you in and make you want to go back.  They should think about opening up one in SOMA here in SF.  They would have my business.  Otherwise, trekking out to the one in Emeryville isn't so bad - but, it seems so far across the bay bridge... hehehe (san francisco joke)."}
{"text":"My mom is in love with their Kung Pao foods and finally convinced me to try them when we were at the mall one day. I expected it to be okay, but I ended up loving it, especially their Kung Pao beef! The texture of the food is absolutely amazing. The crispiness of their beef comes through the sauce they put on top of it. The crispiness goes really well with the crunchy carrots and peanuts in the dish. It's a little salty, but it goes great with their rice.  Another great dish is their Salt & Pepper Calamari. It is nothing like calamari you have had in the past. Other calamari I have had is greasy and oily but theirs is light and fluffy. The outside has a nice crunch while the calamari on the inside still has its original texture. The dipping sauces are great and provide a nice sour twang to the calamari.  The service is attentive but not annoying and the decorations are super cute. Overall, it is a great place to go for a fun night out!"}
{"text":"My mom, I swear. She can't get past wine in a box, Costco, or chain restaraunts. But anyway...This was where she took the fam for my brother's birthday this year, because he's into Chinese. Whether it actually was Chinese is debatable.  We started with the lettuce wraps,because that's what you do at PF Changs. Yeah, they were ok, a bit salty.  We got big plates of a bunch of different dishes. Nothing memorable.   My dad sat with his beer and ate nothing, which really cracked me up. He hates Chinese food and there is not any American alternative to choose from. Occasionally we would hear him grunt in displeasure at the whole experience.   Over-hyped, over-rated.   My mother's take: This place is great! We should come here for your birthday Nesto.   wow."}
{"text":"I really love PF Changs.  They offer lots of vegetarian options (even lettuce wraps - YUM).  I went there the other night with a large party for someone's birthday.  We had reservations and the place was slow, so we sat right away.  The waitress was very prompt and attentive, even though we could all tell that she was a little worried about having a large party.    We hardly waited at all for our dinners - which were a combination of vegetarian and meated dinners.    I had the Ma Po Tofu.  It was so good - and when I went home and looked up the fattiness thereof, it is a reasonable and healthful choice!  How exciting and refreshing is that?  I will definitely go back to PF's.  (and it's little sister Pei Wei.)  Yum!"}
{"text":"All together a failure, the food is not up to the quality you would expect from this chain. The service was terrible and it is very expensive considering the portions are half their regular size. There was a piece of plastic in one of our dishes to which our server said sorry about that and walked away! Our waiter seemed distracted and didn't seem to care either way, no recommendations no water no personality whatsoever. Overall a failure !"}
{"text":"Good service,food was refreshing. Egg drop soup was so yummy. Samon caesar salad on point!"}
{"text":"Usually a great experience here! I used to work for P.F. Chang's in California as a waitress, and I'd say that we have great service 99% of the time we dine here.   I can almost swear that the little things that have changed are starting to annoy me. The proportions must have shrunk 30% in size (check out their new serverware, they're not fully round anymore, they more assymetrial and odd-shaped, to give the guest a more \"full\" visual affect that they haven't cut down in portions). But they have. They have switched to the cheap, off-white, plastic chopsticks, (they used to be dark brown or black). I think they have decided to cut back on costs by doing these things..but then their prices are higher now? That doesn't make any sense. How is it $6 for 2 spring rolls?   Other than the price gouge and portion's continually shrinking, the taste of the food is amazing. Yes, it is not real Chinese food. Duh. I'm Chinese. lol. But it sure beats walking into a hole-in-the-wall chinese restraunt with bright florescent lighting, awful music, and pink table clothes. You know what I'm talkin' about. Authentic Chinese food cannot be beat. Hands down. But P.F. Chang takes the cake for interior design, not necessarily the food."}
{"text":"This place is where Asian fusion food goes to die a miserable lonely death of un-deliciousness.  Everything that made PF Changs a go to Chinese food spot 15 years ago has completely disappeared.  The food is sub par to say the least and I am positive the business survives on its ever aging senior regulars and young couples with coupons.    I did not make it past my appetizer when I completely gave up on this place.  The \"handmade\" steamed shrimp dumplings tasted soggy and frozen.  I couldn't even taste the little micro bits of shrimp in the soggy wonton wraps because the dumplings arrived coated in a cold oily black peppercorn sauce.   So.... Ummm ... Mister or miss chef ... What happens when you eat two tablespoons of whole black peppercorns in a sauce???????? I'll tell you, you can't taste anything to else for the next ten hours!!! Extraordinarily poor composition of sauce and plating.    In addition to worst food I've tasted in years, the bar service was even worse.  The bartender made it fairly clear she was \"opening\"'tomorrow and made cleaning and preparing the bar for the next day her priority over serving guests.  Hopefully she ll be a better server tomorrow.   If you have taste buds and care about your waistline, avoid this travesty."}
{"text":"Constipated?? Tired of going to the store to get laxatives? I have the solution for you.  Order the lettuce wraps at PF Changs. We recently dined here as we have for several years.  Unfortunately, the quality seems to be declining. After three days of constantly visiting the porcelain throne, I called the restaurant and talked to a manager named Brad.  He said he would file a \"claim\" and I gave him my name, etc.  By the way he handled my call to inform them so that other customers would not be affected, I got the impression that he is no stranger to complaints about the food. It is a shame.  They used to be great. Fortunately, there are so many other restaurants here in the Valley from which to choose."}
{"text":"The ambiance is really nice, didn't wait long for a table. Once our party arrived a waitress came right over to take drink and app orders, but seemed rushed and didn't really wait for everyone to answer when she asked if anyone wanted drinks.  Apps came quickly but one was missing. Everyone had finished theirs by the time the last one came and we had to ask about it twice.  The waitress seemed rushed again taking our main orders. All arrived together and correct.  Food was delicious, everyone was happy. I had the Mongolian beef, with fried rice and a side of cucumbers. Was all great, super flavourful.  Desserts were yummy too, I had the chocolate wontons. Not too sweet, and can order small plate (2) or large (4) which I like, because sometimes a large portion of dessert is just too much.  The cirque came promptly and it was very affordable."}
{"text":"This place was extremely disappointing! We were served lunch sizes portions for dinner at $24 each ! We spent $186 2 adults & 2 kids and we were all still hungry ! The tea was served cold with sake cups ! The coffee was so bad we couldn't drink it . We complained to the manger & he wouldn't remove the cold tea or coffee off the bill instead offered a free entry next time . No thanks we will never go there again .  I do not recommend this place ! They will not last long in this city ."}
{"text":"These 5 stars are for the hostess Alaia.  She saw me walking with my mom who walks with a cane and she ran out from behind the desk and opened the second door for us.  She gave us a table right away all the while with a big wins full smile on her face! Also kudos to Dylan for great friendly service without seeming fake, thanks Dylan!! The jicama street tacos are a must!!!!"}
{"text":"Review is based off of my to go order. When I walked in the hostess was standing and typing, I said, \"hello, how are you?\" To which I received no response. After standing there for a couple of minutes in silence, she looks up at me and says \"just one?\" I think Firehouse subs is better at greeting customers, which really isn't a hard thing. Even a response to my greeting would have been better than nothing.   Now I am standing over here by the order pick up and not a single employee has said a word to me.. At least 10 people have walked by and not even one has asked if I've been helped. I understand I'm not dining in but is it hard to treat every guest with simple kindness?   This is hard for me as the food here is amazing! I feel cheated though as I think plenty of fast food restaurants would treat a customer better. I am a well dressed outgoing person so I cant imagine how someone who didn't look like their \"target audience\" would be treated."}
{"text":"So I have ate at a lot of places in my day, some franchise thru the roof and some low key, mainly cause I love food! Yeah I said it!!! Anyway I know what I like and I am always pleased with this PF Chang's.  I have been to other PF's around the valley and none are this good, they are consistent and I know I will be satisfied when I'm done eating .   This place has always come thru when i needed it the most.  Now don't get me wrong, it's not authentic Chinese food, but few are, and What i want is easy really good American Chinese food that has a kid/family friendly environment and that's why P.F. Chang's in chandler does its thang!"}
{"text":"I visit PH Chang's maybe once a year when I have a gift card to get rid of.   The food is okay, but for what I order, usually vegetarian, I'm not too impressed.   In my most recent visit I ordered some steamed vegi dumplings and vegetable lo mein.   The dumplings were good and maybe even a newer item as I don't remember seeing them the last time.   The lo mein was kinda overly saucy and could use some more vegetables.   Honestly Pei Wei makes a much better fresher hotter lo mein dish.   That's why I go there even without a gift card.      Service was okay.    Felt a little rushed and the server was a bit forgetful.     Overall a good meal with no whopping complaints."}
{"text":"Went to PF Changs yesterday. Hadn't been there in a couple years. Went for happy hour and got the Pork Dumplings, Calamari, Chicken Flatbread, and Egg Rolls for appetizers. And had Moo Goo Gai Pan. Everything tasted awesome. Not sure why I hadn't eaten there in so long."}
{"text":"Four stars for service, comfy chairs and classy surroundings. Two stars for the food.   Chinese food has always been about inexpensive tasty food with some different flavors. PF Chang's is the antithesis of this: moderately good food at an expensive price. It probably costs so much because of the huge horse statues out front--I mean, really?   We were with a group and joined them late, but waiters whisked over to the table, brought us menus and drinks, and got us some rice right away. They quickly took our order and rushed it to the kitchen. We were eating in maybe 20 minutes. Considering that it was a very crowded Saturday night, that was very impressive. The servers were helpful with suggestions and very friendly. The kitchen was fast.   What I liked about the food was they came up with a little unusual and creative ideas: my wife ordered a lamb dish and they put some cilantro in it; not a classic Chinese ingredient but a good use of local flavor. I also liked that the kitchen was able to substitute shrimp for pork in my dish, although not on the menu.   What I didn't like was that my Mu Shu vegetables seemed overcooked without that much flavor, and the pancakes started toughening up at the end. By comparison, an independent Chinese restaurant in Phoenix made this dish with fresh-tasting vegetables with more flavor, and the pancakes were so delicate they practically melted in your mouth.   This place is okay for a larger group, and in this area, but for value and food quality, I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch on tax day to receive the additional 15% off.  The promotion is definitely what brought us in. Ordered the chicken chopped salad, beef and broccoli lunch, and the spring rolls.  Everything was excellent and came out quick. If you like iced tea I would suggest ordering it because it's unsweetened and very good."}
{"text":"Don't go aggro on me, Chain haters! Yeah, I like P.F. Changs. Deal with it in a constructive and mature manner.  So I go here last night with my wife and son.  I didn't have to wait, for I called in earlier and got on the list (smart thinkin' bro!).  We all meet up and walk into the joint.  Oh, and exterior decorators... My son LOVED the ginormous horse outside, BTW thx!  We get a table and order.  I can't recall what my wife ordered.  Some sort of garlic shrimp plate with snow peas... It was worth a nom. My dish, however was the full triple nom. Double Pan Fried Noodles. Freaking amazing.  It tasted like the Kung Pao Chicken had rolled around on a bed of noodles so FAST that it cooked them to a delightful crisp and then left its tasty juices behind on its bed. Nom Nom Nom.  We also order Crispy Green Beans for my son, but we ended up eating most of them ourselves. Sorry Conor :( but they were too good to pass up!!!! Tempura coated green beans lightly cooked and served with a spicy ranch style dipping sauce.  It was equally delish!  Not to mention our waiter was on key that night.  He stopped by a few times and filled our mango ice teas and even bagged us up some extra sauce for the beans. Score!  Overall, it was a memorable night with my beautiful fam... good freakin times, yo"}
{"text":"On New Years Day 2014 my family decided to have dinner here. Our daughter was in charge of ordering while I was in charge of paying. She ordered: Dynamite Shrimp $7, Chicken Lettuce Wrap $6, Lo Mein $9.95, Kung Pao Shrimp $16.95, Orange Peel Beef $14.95 along with brown rice. This was enough for our family of four. Great service, clean restrooms and parking lot."}
{"text":"Always love a place that has consistent food quality, and an exceptional staff! I have a few favorite items, and generally stick with them, but when I decide to go outside the box, I'm never disappointed with the food!  Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"Best service I've ever gotten at a PF Changs. I love when a waitress actually takes the time to talk to us about something besides what we want to drink and eat. Ours did just that and made us laugh. The food was the same as always, but her animation regarding our mutual guilty pleasure, Project Runway, made the lunch memorable. Cheers to that."}
{"text":"The staff is always polite and friendly and are quick to fix any problems you might have.  The portion sizes are great if you want to do family style dining, or get something just for yourself and have plenty left over for lunch the next day.  Not a place you want to go if you are looking for a quite night out, but otherwise the atmosphere is romantic enough to take a date to on a Friday night (just be sure to make reservations!) .  Personal favorites are Chang's Spicy Shrimp and the Banana Egg Rolls."}
{"text":"Wonderful service.  Wonderful food.  Pf Chang never disappoints.   One of the best Hot n Sour soups ever.  Lettuce wraps are great.  All entres were excellent.  A great experience.  Thanks Stefanie for the nice service."}
{"text":"Went in for a special night and just got appetizers.  Got 2 of the calamari and 2 of the lettuce wraps.  Wow, those 2 things are amazing.  I have eaten here before and they are consistent.  Of course I will go back!"}
{"text":"I love the P.F. Chang's franchise. They always have quality food and quality service. This location was no exception. We got there early enough for half price starters. You can never go wrong with their lettuce wraps and their house made ginger ale is delicious. We ordered the crispy honey chicken and the surf and turf. The surf and turf was tasty but I'm pretty sure they tried to pass crawfish off as lobster and there definitely wasn't enough protein on that plate to just a $25 price tag."}
{"text":"What a PERFECT experience to make up for the past ones!!! I am definitely happy that we went to this location this evening!! We went later in the evening, so the location wasn't too busy. We were greeted and seated almost immediately by Barbi who actually ended up being our server. Barbi was busy as she was the only server left on the floor and though we arrived when she got a little bit of a rush; well, she treated us like we were her only table! Before I knew it, we had our appetizers along with a second set of our soft drinks waiting for us for when we finished our first!! I like that she did this because, she knew that she had gotten busy with a small closing rush and she prepared us to have everything we could possibly want so that we didn't have to wait!! Barbi continued to check on us throughout our meal and was just overall wonderful! She was friendly, polite, when I asked about certain menu items she took the time to explain regardless of the fact that she was busy. Of course the food was amazing but at this location; the food gets the credit it deserves by being brought to you promptly and with a friendly face! Was she busy with several tables? Sure. Did she give us just the right amount of attention to make sure we had a nice, intimate meal with just the right amount of service? Most definitely!! I would definitely return to THIS P.F. Chang's and definitely recommend to others. There were a few servers there who were closing down their tables and they took the time to help Barbi when needed (our appetizers) and they were just as helpful and friendly!   *We had gone in with a gift card from our previous experience at a different location and I have to say overall I am pleased with the companies outlook on long term retention!! Sure, someone reaching out to say they are '..sorry to hear...' is always nice but them taking the time to try to allow us a nice relaxing dinner like paid for... well that is priceless!! Thank you to the Customer Relations team and Tawnya who helped us to finally find a great location and enjoy the wonderful meal and service!! Definitely will recommend this place to family and friends' for whatever events they may have coming up as well!! Barbi would be a great server for such events!!"}
{"text":"Tonight I would give it 4 stars. It was a busy night yet we were seated sooner than anticipated and served promptly. Good quality ingredients served hot. Flavorful dishes. Server was very good, we forewarned him we like a lot of their special sauce and he prepared  a small bowl rather than their usual tiny bowl of it. Nice not to feel like you need to harass the busy server for more sauce. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a P.F. Chang's in years and it was a pleasant welcome back (especially as a vegetarian now). They actually had labeled vegetarian options woo hoo! The flavors were great and I will be back again before too long I'm sure!"}
{"text":"Nice venue for dinner amongst friends. We had & shared several dishes and really enjoyed it. The staff were very friendly and look forward to going back. ."}
{"text":"First off it started out a little sketchy for one thing the guy on the phone said it would be a 15 to 20 minute wait when we got there in about five minutes it jumped to 25-30 minute wait. So we decided to go with it.  We waited then I asked a hostess and she said we would have 2 parties a head of us and that ended up being 5 a head of us when I raised the issue I got a rude response back from one of the hostesses saying we would be seated with in the allotted time. I did not appreciate how and what she said.  But finally we were seated and I already had a sour taste in my mouth about this experience. But that is when Mike stepped in to change it all around he was very nice explained what in his opinion was best on the menu based on what we were in the mood for and boy did he get the meals we wanted and our meals were delicious to say the least and not only that we got to try the sweet and sour soup and we had the sesame chicken and this slightly spivey fish. Suffice it to say that Mike changed our 1 star experience into a four star experience if the hostesses would have done their job it would have been a 5 star experience we are going back in spite of the hostesses and because of  Mike and the great meal. Thank you Mike for making out valentines eve night a memorable and tasty evening."}
{"text":"Went again last night as a Moms Night Out with a group of 7 friends- I did not pick the restaurant.  I ordered a tofu and vegetables in a coconut curry sauce.  YUM!  Hot sake for $4.50 was huge and a draft Kirin beer.  Total bill with tax and tip was $23."}
{"text":"I have been going to P.F. Chang's since it first opened up at Fashion Square in the  2000. First owned by Paul Fleming and sold awhile ago this restaurant has not changed the menu much ( thank God).You can still find really good Asian Fusion food all over the country. ( I know I used to travel for business).  I was here at the Chandler location meeting my friend for dinner. Our waitress was fabulous. Smart, funny and really nice.  She checked on me  while I waited about 1/2 hour for my girlfriend to arrive.  Dinner was amazing. I had the Shrimp Lo Mein which I am addicted too. My girlfriend had a dinner portion of the lettuce wrap.  We both also had desert. Service was fast and our food came out hot just like it should. Our waitress checked on use frequently and didn't mind that we sat there and talked for an additional two hours after we were done eating catching up.  I see some of the bad reviews for this location, but for me I have to disagree. Good food, great service and wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer at P.F. Chang's for many years, often using them for business lunches and meals with the family.  A key feature for me has always been their excellent gluten free menu as I am gluten sensitive.  I was shocked this past week when I was there on a business meeting for lunch and was told that the fried rice at lunch is NOT gluten free. I asked lots of questions of the waitress since I had been told many times in the past that it was gluten free by previous wait staff.  The waitress informed me that 2-3 months ago they changed this in the kitchen and that I should not order the fried rice there again.  I was in shock and felt very disappointed since I had asked about this numerous times in the past and was assured that this was safe.  On the following weekend, I was nearby with my family and we stopped in to this same P.F. Chang's for dinner.  We were greeted by a waitress who was about to go off shift, but did agree to take our order since we had been waiting and our new waiter had not arrived yet.  Before ordering, she had placed the sauces and I had asked a question about whether the sauces were gluten free.  Typically they bring the gluten soy sauce out first and have to replace the sauces, mustard, chili sauce after a gluten free order is made.  She proceeded to explain to me that these were in red ramekins so I shouldn't worry; that they were gluten free.  I proceeded to explain to her very politely how I wanted to make sure since I was very surprised to learn earlier in the week about the fried rice not being gluten free.  What a mistake.  She proceeded to patronize me and explain how their fried rice is never gluten free and that I should have never ordered it.   Not even an apology for my previous experiences.  Rather a 15 minute lecture on how nothing has changed in the kitchen there and that I must be all wrong and the waitress could not have told me this earlier in the week.  When I explained to her that the crab fried rice is supposed to be gluten free and is fried and is on the gluten free menu, she again proceeded to talk down to me.  It made for miserable dinner experience, which was only slightly improved by her going off-shift.  While P.F. Chang's makes a solid effort to put out a gluten free menu, after my experience I have to say the wait staff are not properly educated on food allergies or how to talk to customers.  My advice to food allergy sufferers is to be very cautious on dining at this restaurant chain. I know I have misgivings about going back..."}
{"text":"Wanted a lil' something between a snack and a meal and so we got the wonton soup, hot and sour soup, and the chicken lettuce wrap.  The wonton soup's broth was nothing like I've tasted before...Definitely not like the broth you'd get in Chinatown or at a food court...It tasted like a beef broth; don't know if I like it.  The soup seemed oily, with spinach, a shrimp and water chestnut in the soup, and the wonton is filled with pork.   The hot and sour soupwas good...Watery, which is unlike the cornstarch-y/gel-like ones that I am used to.  The chicken lettuce wraps are always delicious.  You can always ask for more lettuce if you don't think there is enough, or just ram pack your lettuce roll with the meat since there is so much.  Make sure you ask for the sauce (chili, hot mustard, and the third I'm not sure if it's a mixture of soy sauce and sesame oil).  This is a good place to go to if you want to feel fancy eating Chinese food."}
{"text":"Last time I checked Family Style was suppose to feed 5-7 people right? Not here!!! You'd think you'd get more than 6 pieces of Orange Chicken for $15. Don't get me wrong the service was great but food and drinks are way over priced!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times, mainly for team lunches, so I thought I'd review it this time.  When you walk in, you get that classy Asian vibe.   It's fairly upscale looking.  But the first thing I noticed was how few Chinese people there are.  I think I was the only one.    We had the chicken lettuce wrap for the appetizer. The chicken was not as tender as some other lettuce wraps I've had, and the soysauce may have overpowered the taste of the chicken.  But it was edible.  I tried one of the lunch bowls: pepper steak.  It said it should by spicy, but I couldn't feel the spice.  The beef was cooked well, but they ODed on the sauce making it too salty.    I thought the dessert shooters were really cute.  It's a good portion for those who want to have some desserts but not overstuff ourselves after a heavy main course.  The tiramisu shooter isn't as good.  But then it's not expected to have a tiramisu flavor in a Chinese oriented place.  It tastes more like a tiramisu cake instead of the traditional soft and creamy tiramisu I'm used to at an Italian restaurant.  What I do like about the restaurant is the different tea flavors you can choose from.  And they bring it out for you in a traditional Chinese/Japanese like teapot to set the Asian mood.  It's a good alternative for a tea house.   Pf Chang's is good to have food for the people who like the Chinese-American fusion.  It may be a good place to start if you're scared of \"real\" Chinese food.  It's not a good place for authentic Chinese food.  And the price is more than I would pay for average tasting lunch."}
{"text":"Still unable to find really good Chinese food, we thought we would try this again. Service, not great.  She placed our food on the table and as she was reaching to place a plate in front of us she dropped it on the floor, It shattered everywhere!  We had glass in our laps, as we were looking to see if there was glass in our food, she said \"I don't see any glass in there\"  Fortunately we did not discover any glass in our food but I felt she should have replaced everything, that would have been excellent and expected customer service. If we had found glass this would be a very different review.  We are forgiving people, I make mistakes at work almost every day.   Needless to say,  she did not get our usual 18 or 20% tip. As for the food.  I really liked the wonton soup and the lo mein was good as was the cashew chicken.   Too bad the experience did not match."}
{"text":"The food is what you would expect from P.F. Changs, but I am giving 5 stars for the awesome service we received. I came into the restaurant with a group of girlfriends on Friday night, the restaurant was relatively busy - but our waiter, Tyler, did a great job of making us feel important. He was consistent with filling our drinks and got all of our orders right (though a couple of my friends ordered specialized dishes). Simply for the service we received, we all agreed that it was the best experience we have had with the chain. Will be coming back on our next movie night!"}
{"text":"I really love this restaurant. In regards to this location, I've never had a bad experience. My most recent time was just a casual dinner with a date. We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps (always a delicious classic), asparagus, and we each ordered the kung pao shrimp. Everything was absolutely delicious. Only criticism I had was I ordered a mai tai and it was just way too strong. Of all the PF Changs I've been too, I really like this location. It's a little smaller than most locations (in my opinion), but never crowded or anything like that."}
{"text":"Good food as always!!  The waiter talked a bit too much. I like to talk to my wife during dinner, not the waiter."}
{"text":"First of all if you consider this to be Asian food you don't know what Asian food is... It is clearly an extremely Americanized Chinese restaurant with things like \"Buddha rolls\" on the menu and several versions of General Tao chicken / kung Pao chicken.   That being said the interior is splendid and it is above average Americanized Chinese food that I do not mind having once in a while. I had the crispy chicken, yes it did cost more than 5$ but it was much better then the filth you will get at the food court.   Will I go back? Probably it was a good experience and I liked the food but I don't kind myself that I am having exotic Asia cuisine and it is a big chain in the USA"}
{"text":"I placed a order for pick up the other night and let me just say my experience over the phone was horrendous. I can't stress enough how important customer service is in my eyes. I called and was immediately transferred after the first girl who answered the phone couldn't take my order for some reason. So, finally I reached Mike... he was so rude. During our phone call he kept talking to guests and yelling \"Goodbye!!\"  while I'm telling him my order. After I told him my order he asked if I knew what location I was heading with an attitude. I told him I was aware of what location I was heading to. He then told me he just wants to make sure the cooks don't make the food for nothing and I actually show up. At this point I want to yell at him, but I'm positive he's just mad that he has to take a to-go order from someone half his age. Customer service makes a place of business amazing and this place failed miserably because Mike couldn't take a simple order and say thank you. I won't be returning here ever again :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have found a new favorite that really hits the spot when we're craving Asian food.  It's also a unique experience for us since I'm very much from the Friends' school of \"Joey doesn't share food!\" but the experience at PF Chang's is so much better when you share... :-)  We love the starters and have tried many of them, but our favorites would have to be the Dynamite Shrimp (served in a martini glass), the chicken dumplings (pan-fried and drizzled with delicious peanut sauce) and the spring rolls.    For mains, we're still exploring but usually have the Chang's Chicken or Sesame chicken since we both love the flavor & perfect amount of heat... and then we try a new dish each time.    Last night we had the Coconut curry veggies & tofu from the vegetarian section and while we really liked the veggies & sauce, the silken tofu was NOT up our alley.  It was mushy and tasteless and almost made me gag... admittedly, I'm a picky eater, but my husband who will pretty much eat ANYTHING couldn't get past the first bite either.    Luckily everything else was delicious and our server was efficient and helpful as always.  We finished off by sharing a couple of desserts and laughing at our \"fortunes\".  Definitely recommend you go during the week vs. the weekend as the kitchen seems  to be a little more on the ball on slow nights."}
{"text":"This is not a knock on PF Chang's, but on my last visit I realized that I like Pei Wei better.  I would rather visit their fast casual restaurant, as it is basically the same food at a better price."}
{"text":"I was shopping at the mall, and I got hungry So I thought about my choices, and decided to try out PF Chang's.  I haven't eaten PF Chang's in like... 10 years.  I ordered their lettuce wraps, and man o man, I loved them! I could eat them every day.  So yeah, that's all.  I did like that when I told the server of my peanut allergy, she totally took it seriously and had the kitchen use separate pots and pans for my food.  I'm such a princess.  :)"}
{"text":"Chose this place for an early dinner and wow were we disappointed.  Used to come here a lot years ago, sadly we will not be back.   The tempura veggies and calamari were bland,  soggy and really greasy.  When people don't finish an appetizer and ask that it be removed,  a server should know it's bad.   I had the Ma Po Tofu,  bland with no sauce to speak of and also the asparagus side dish.   The asparagus was ok but was also extremely greasy.   Husband had the sichuan beef,  he picked out some of the meat and left the rest.   His dish had no real sauce either, just...you guessed it...greasy...makes for some dry rice.  We really should have sent back some of the food, but it was my birthday dinner and neither of us wanted to spoil it.   But who knew that the food would spoil it for us!?   I put my to go box directly in the garbage when we got home. There are many, many, much better authentic Asian places in Chandler, stay in your car and drive to one."}
{"text":"PROS: -Big space, air conditioned, clean. -The best dish and only thing worth noting that we had was the lettuce wrapped chicken.  -Friendly service.   CONS: -I had the shrimp in lobster sauce. It essentially tasted like I was eating plastic there was so much corn starch. I couldn't have more than 2 bites before I lost my appetite.   -Not authentic Chinese, FAAARRRRRR from it, but Americanized Chinese is PF Chang's \"thing\", so if you're into that, this is the place to go.   p.s. Tiramisu at a Chinese restaurant...first time I've seen that."}
{"text":"I have not been to this place in forever and I will tell ya why. Because Pei Wei exist! It is the sister company of PF Changs so alot of the dishes are the same, in fact, I think they taste better at Pei Wei. In addition, its way cheaper and you get alot more then what they give you at Changs, Although its walk up and order and get your own drinks, utensils, etc, they bring your food to you. There is no tip necessary which saves ya $. Its just better all the way around.  Now I am not completely knocking Changs. Their food is very good. I especially enjoy the lettuce wraps and crab wontons (which I can get at Pei Wei), the orange beef (Pei wei has it also!), the Changs spicy chicken (only at Changs), and their lo mein (Different here then at Pei Wei). However, I feel like I have to order all of these things when I come here just to get full!!! That in turn comes out to over 80.00! K to sum it up, this place is not bad, not good, simply ok in my opinion but I will probably never go here unless someone else insist on this and I cant talk them into Pei Wei. Haha"}
{"text":"Great service great food very satisfied hard to find restaurants like this these days organized fast service nice atmosphere and great food!."}
{"text":"So I gave it a try and surprisingly it's pretty good. Service is good . I tried the northern ribs and it's very tasty."}
{"text":"I'm going to write a quick review as I'm on vacation. This is for the location outside the mall  PF Changs Décarie. First off the outside greets you with 2 large warrior horses-wow! Then you enter & the entrance wows me again with their high ceilings & Chinese decor of grandeur. Hostess greets us immediately-good.  We are waited upon in a timely manner. We order large bowl of wonton soup ($9.99)& dynamite shrimps($11.49) as apps. Came fast.  Soup had a mild balanced blend of flavour which was good. But chicken pieces were overcooked tuff & dry -hard to swallow. The actual wontons were tasty.  Dynamite shrimps were tossed in a chili mayo sauce which was actually little spicy,just right for most \"tourist\". For me little too saucy but my family liked.  Main meal we ordered shrimp in lobster sauce. This is where I got disappointed;the sauce was way too runny & thin. It had a slight bitter aftertaste. The eggs were clumped in one big clump..sigh won't order again. It was $$18.99 so I expect better of this chain. Kinda pricy for what you get. Next we had Mongolian beef $18.99 this was tasty, good flavour but disappointed that they use flank steak which made the meat chewy & a bit hard to swallow. The meat is thick cut. We had steam rice to accompany the meal.  This place is kinda pricy for what you get.  I'm not feeling like this would be a \"go to place\" as a normal weekly dining place but if you are taking someone on a date or doing the tourist thing then it's good to try once just because the decor should be enuf to \"blind\" them a bit & food is ok.(not wow or great)  I say that because the atmosphere & decor & friendly service make up for some of the shortfalls of the meal. I'm used to spectacular chinese food so that could be it too. I'm not one to write off a restaurant on a first try either unless they did so poorly on a first time basis, so with that in mind I would try PF Changs again but order some other items to see how they fare. As for this visit to Montreal I'm good for a long while. I'm giving them 3 stars based on everything -I would give them a 5 for decor alone tho!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in a while but for some reason it sounded good so we dropped in for some grub last night. Wait time was 20-30 minutes and after 45 we finally found ourselves a table. They must have been understaffed, unusual for a restaurant on a Friday night, because there was plenty of tables available  & no one was getting seated. Not really sure why other people were sat before us when they arrived after us but who knows how the greeters really handle things.  Since we had plenty of time to study the menu ordering our food was handled promptly. The waitress was wonderful & quick to provide service. It took a while for the food to arrive so we had another bit of a wait.   Food wise-it was great, appetizers, egg drop soup & our dishes came out great & we enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for a meal with friends. The food was definitely delicious and met expectations - and a new dish we tried was the Dan Noodles. They were great! What really made this a great experience was that the gal who put together our order went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. They were also generous when I a couple different coupons and gift cards in making sure everything worked out. Thanks!"}
{"text":"**Carry-Out Review**  I really do enjoy the food from P.F. Changs, so imagine my delight when I received a couple free gift cards. Not having time to dine-in, I opted for carry-out at this location closest to my gf's house.   Pro's:  -Courteous and efficient staff on the phone. They cut right to the chase, offered me the typical add-ons and gave me a time frame to arrive. -Delicious food! We ordered chicken lettuce wraps (never disappoints), cashew almond chicken (large chunks of chicken and tasty sauce), beef with broccoli (my personal fav).  Con's:  -Tardiness. I showed up on the later end of the arrival range and waited 10-15 more minutes. -Busy waiting area. The carry-out cashier is the bartender and there's not really a great place to sit or even stand if the bar is full. There is a small seating area but it's directly adjacent to diners, so rather awkward (\"hey, mind if I steal an eggroll since I'm practically at your table\") -The broccoli beef leaked all over the bottom of the bag. Unfortunate.  Bonus points: -I was offered water a number of times. Mostly because I was standing in the way of the kitchen, but it was still nice of them to ask. -Very nice staff who apologized for my wait.  Bottom line: Unless you absolutely need to do carry-out, this P.F. Chang's China Bistro is really set up to give you a wonderful in-house dining experience. Gift cards or not, take them up on that!"}
{"text":"Not good - service was bad - definitely another corporate failure.....don't waste your time unless you love \"food\" that tastes a little. It less in quality than a TV dinner - hey there may be some folks that like that.... RIGHT??"}
{"text":"The Chicken lettuce wraps were awesome! So were the Almond and Cashew chicken and fried rice. Always, always opt for the Egg drop soup. :) Service was quick and prompt, we just had to wait for 20 minutes, but it was a Friday night so that was expected."}
{"text":"If there was an option for zero stars I would absolutely use it. My friend had two gift cards that she received a couple years ago and called to make sure that they were still valid. She was told that they never expire by a staff member and then was put on hold while the staff member got the manager on the phone. The manager said that the number on the gift cards would show if they were valid or not and if she brought them in the store he would look them up. She then told him that she had the gift cards and could give him the numbers over the phone. He then said that he did not have time to look the gift card numbers up. My friend, frustrated and astonished that a manager would treat her so horribly called back and asked for the corporate or district manager's phone number, which the manager Mike refused to provide. I still can't wrap my head around how the manager Mike treated a potential guest. Due to this I will never dine at any PF Changs again."}
{"text":"I like to think of Chang's as the Area 51 of Asian dining. Mainly because the executive chef is constantly changing the menu, and whenever this happens, my favorite dishes become conspicuously absent from the menu. That is, until you ask the server for your menu-absent favorite.  Ahem, excuse me, \"What happened to the grilled salmon?\" \"Oh we still serve it - its just not on the menu anymore.\"  Why is this, I wonder?  Apparently, there was room on the menu for the shellfish disclaimer. And the peanut allergy disclaimer. And the gluten intolerance warning. And, how we should notify our server if anyone in our party has a food allergy.  Oh, and I almost forgot, the undercooked meats warning - the one about how eating meats cooked rare may increase my chances of a foodborne illness.  I imagine a conversation between Chang's lawyers and the executive chef going something like this:  Legal team:      \"We're afraid we're going to need about six inches on the bottom of the menu        for all the legal disclaimers, can you get rid of some of the entrees?\"  Executive chef:        \"I suppose I could pare down the menu if need be.\"  Legal team:        \"Yeah, well start by losing the spicy eggplant with ground chicken - no one eats         that shit, and get rid of that weird salmon dish too!\"  Chef:           \"Why yes, I believe I can get rid of those and a few more while I'm at it.\" [gigantic ass-kissing sound in background]   I'm afraid we'll soon see a day when the menu has no food items at all - supplanted by a dining contract, replete with fine print, indemnification sections, and hold harmless clauses and all thanks to diners who are more hungry for lawsuits than they are a great dining experience.  The world's getting weirder by the moment.  In the meantime, if you like eggplant, they make one fine dish that kinda-sorta makes up for the legal warnings - the ones that also hoodged out my grilled salmon."}
{"text":"Let's begin with arrival. There's a homeless person working the greeting station. Ok, maybe she's only dressed like a homeless person. This tyedyed greeter will eventually look up from whatever she's doing, stop chewing her gum long enough to seat you, then go back to (not kidding) walking around the restaurant with menus on her head.  So, then, you've been seated. It turns out the wait staff is very nice and very professional. A+ here.  We tried the PF Chang combo for two. The egg drop soup was fantastic. Someone apparently dropped an entire bag of salt in the hot n sour soup. I'd avoid that. And the dynamite shrimp appetizer was dy-no-mite! Very yummy.  We should have stopped here. The clumsy guy with the salt was back again. My Singapore street noodles had to have enough salt to de-ice the roads in upstate New York for a full winter. Couldn't finish it. By comparison, the Mongolian Beef was less salty, but it's possible a bag of salt might be less salty.  I'd write more but I'm gonna watch the hostess put on makeup at the front counter now. *sigh*"}
{"text":"I must start off by saying the choice to go here was a spur of the moment decision. My boyfriend and I were wanting to eat but it was a little later than usual dinner time so the normal list of authentic hole in the wall types were out. But we also wanted something semi healthy so fast food was out as well. When we arrived, we were sat in a corner table as requested.The atmosphere was what you'd expect from a chain trendy forward american asian fusion joint. However, the lighting was very bright I felt like we were on stage: And now presenting... Okay, the key lime pie martini was amazing! It was delicious but just know they can be dangerous because you cannot taste the alcohol.  We started off by sharing the egg drop soup and egg rolls. The soup was decent but was too dark and not as flavorful as I expected. The egg rolls were way too greasy and soft. We then moved onto our main course where he ordered the coconut curry vegetarian plate and I the oolong steeped bass with spinach. The vegetarian dish was overly sauced in our opinion. The bottom of the plate was all liquid about 1/2 deep...hmm. The vegetables were overcooked and the tofu was very soggy (also there was a ton of it). My fish was prepared nicely but the spinach was a bit salty just sitting in the sauce underneath the bass.  The service seemed to be easy going at first but it got a bit repeatative as the night went on. The server seemed like he wanted to be anywhere but there taking care of us as well as his other guests. The manager stopped by with a typical insincere \"How is everything\" which I actually found to be annoying. The music was a bit loud and overbearing at times when we were just trying to have some calm conversation. All in all, for the prices they charge, I expected more.  Overall: Food = 3, Service = 3.5, Atmosphere = 3, Value = 2.5"}
{"text":"Yummy I love this place. The interior is huge and elegant and cool (hooray for strong AC on hot days). The service is good but on the slow side so beware if you're in a hurry.   Went today for lunch since I was in the area. We got the lunch portions, which is essentially a 1/2 portion of the beef & broccoli with brown rice and my friend got the kung pao shrimp. Each plate was $15 and the lunch time portions were perfectly filling.   Loved the flavours and the calm, cool atmosphere. For around $20 each, we were satisfied. I'd love to go back at dinner time to enjoy some of their other menu items. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Best dining experience in years! The food was very good. If I was to rate just the food, I'd give this location 4 stars. However, the exceptional service gets 5 stars out of me. We had a party of 6 that was filled with special requests, food allergies, etc. Our server Tyler was the most attentive, generous, and quick moving server I've ever had wait on me. He took care of all our needs and more. It's hard to please everyone in our group, but tyler left all of us incredibly happy with our dining experience. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yet another occasion I wish I could do a half star!!  Haven't been here in a long time.  But we had a BOGO coupon, so here we are!  Now I remember why we haven't been here in a long time.  The entree is standalone. No soup, no egg rolls, nothing. Even the lunch menu, where most places have a \"lunch special\" that includes extras, includes nothing.  No egg rolls, no soup, nothing. For lunch you can buy those things as\"add-ons\". Seems cheap for a nice restaurant.  Anyway, we ordered the Chang's chicken and the Sichuan beef.  Portions are small. They should be 50% bigger for the prices charged. Especially when they say they serve \"family style\".  For \"family style\" in most Chinese joints you could have four or five (or more!) people digging into the plates.  But here with these portion sizes you probably couldn't get more than three people getting a portion from any one dish ordered.  C'mon, PF, you can do better than that!  Chang's chicken is really just sweet and sour without the chunks of vegetables and pineapple. Flavor was good, but not what we expected. They should just call it sweet and sour.  We had anticipated something a bit different with some heat to it (they have the chili pepper symbol next to it on the menu).  Sichuan beef had really good flavor.  Really good.  This one was as expected, and we were happy with the flavor, if not the quantity.  The rice tasted old.  Not sure how else to express that.  Being married to an Asian lady we have had a lot of rice over the years, and for lack of a better way to say it this rice (brown) didn't have the fresh nutty flavor one usually gets with brown rice.  Service was fine.  Nothing to knock my socks off, but it was adequate.  Perhaps a bit slow given that they weren't that busy.  Without the coupon this lunch would have run us $37 plus tip.  For TWO entrees.  And, as I've said, not even big entrees.  The flavors were good, but not really \"wow\", and at this price point one expects some \"wow\".  The value just is NOT there at this price.  The BOGO coupon brought it down to $18 plus tip.  For the quantity provided this should have been the price WITHOUT a coupon.  So while the flavors were generally good, the very poor value forces me to go with two stars.  I would do three if the value was there, but it just isn't.  And Yelp still hasn't introduced the half star, so there you go."}
{"text":"So for...15 years I have described PF Changs to people as: \"If I had to eat at a restaurant every day for the rest of my life, I'd choose PF Changs.\" Well...after my last several visits, it is no longer my favorite, and frankly, I don't even care if I ever eat there again.  The chicken lettuce wraps have always been a MUST for me...but the last several times I got them, they were a smaller portion and different somehow. I don't know if there is a change to the recipe or they messed them up every time....all I know is I didn't feel impressed with them like I used to. Many times in the past I would eat lettuce wraps as my meal because I liked them so much...last couple times I didn't even eat 2 wraps. :(  The shrimp with lobster sauce has always been my favorite. Sure, it looks like snot with shrimp and egg in it, but the flavor was always sooooooo good. Last time I went there were TONS of peas in it (there used to be just a few...enough to give it a hint of flavor and color), huge slices of mushroom that overwhelmed the flavor of the entire dish (there used to be little cubes that just gave it a teeny perfect touch of flavor), and when I asked about the recipe change the waiter said it has always been the same. Uhhhh....NO. No it has not, sir! I don't know how long you have been working at PF Changs but I have been eating the SAME DISH probably 80% of the times I have visited since 1999 when I moved here and discovered PF Changs. I can tell you that it is very very different and has changed within the last...6 months maybe. It's most certainly a change and not a good one. I didn't like it at all. To make matters worse, I ordered it on my birthday last month and didn't even eat more than a couple bites because I was so disappointed with the flavor. No use taking leftovers home when you have no interest in eating them either. It sucked.  The beautiful Asian decor has always been appealing to me...one of my favorite parts of eating there. I used to imagine how awesome it would be to have similar decoration in my own home. But...they've recently begun remodeling to some kind of snooty contemporary crap. I don't like it at all. Feels very cold and Scottsdale-ish.  On top of all this, there was the credit card debacle. I had to get a new card because of it. I know it's not their fault and they did everything they had to once they found out in order to prevent it from happening again. However, it was just another negative in about a 6 month line of bad PF Changs visits that put a bad taste in my mouth; literally and figuratively.  I don't know if PF Changs business was down or if customers expressed some desire for all these changes, but whatever the reason, they have lost me as a customer. I'm sad about this. It was my absolute fave for 15 years."}
{"text":"When it comes to Chinese food, this is the only place I'll go. Fantastic appetizers and delicious mains. They bring the food in big dishes and put them in the middle of the table for all to share. The shrimp dumplings were good but their tuna tataki appetizer was out of this world! Our mains consisted of Street Noodles, Chili Shrimp Noodles and Mongolian Beef. All were piping hot and very generous sized servings! We ordered way too much food and would definitely scale it down next time. 2 mains is more than enough food for 3 adults."}
{"text":"Dillon was a fabulous waiter!!  Haven't been in here in a long time and was pleased with the food and service.  I won't wait so long to come back."}
{"text":"We stopped going here because the food quality/quantity went down and the prices went up.  But I decided to use a coupon and place a To Go order online.  It was ready for me when I arrived at my requested time, and the to go person repeated my order while he picked up each item - which was what I had ordered.  When I got home the order was WRONG.  BEEF fried (white) rice instead of chicken fried (brown) rice - it was gross.  My kids don't eat beef. I called and spoke with Mike, Manager who seemed irritated that I would have the gumption to complain about my order being wrong.  Since I had no intention of driving back (20 minutes away), I asked if the item would be refunded to my card.  He said \"no.\"  I then asked why it would not be credited back.  He said, \"It will get refunded to your account.\"  I said, \"My card then?\"  He said, \"No, your account.\"  I wanted to know what that meant - he did a huffy breath and then said, \"Yes, refunded.\"  It's been 24 hours and nothing has been refunded.  Food not that great - wasted $40.  Not going back E.V.E.R."}
{"text":"Went here with my new family for Chinese New Years.  Sat next to the kids and once they had their rice they seemed happy.  It was late and they were tired.    There were 12 of us including the kids so I think we tried most everything.  Ok not everything but we had fish, shrimp, beef, chicken, fried rice, veggies and of course some yummy drinks.  Dessert was fortune cookies.  Mine said better luck next cookie. LOL!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of hype about the opening of this restaurant for a while.   I went there last Sunday for dinner.  The place was packed.  Luckily we didn't have to wait too long.  A very hip and trendy place.  The decor and ambiance of the place were very nice and comfortable.  Food was decently good.  Service was a bit slow since the servers were still in training mode.  This is probably a good place to take a date out for a Friday or Saturday night out."}
{"text":"This place is good!! Never can go wrong with the lettuce wraps! It can be kinda of pricy tho."}
{"text":"Great ambience with not the friendliest employees. I appreciate the small things of smiling and asking how you are doing, and did not really get that kind of customer service. The waitress seemed rushed and did not allow for time to ask questions especially since it was my first time. They brought out a sake bomber that we had ordered first and it was not what we expected, but we made it work. Then came out some spring rolls that were absolutely delicious. Then came out our entrees and i had the noodles with shrimp in which were lacking shrimp and vegetables. I felt that the plate was mainly noodles and sure I took a to go box, but the box was all noodles. I would like to go back and try other entrees and see if they are better. I'll update my review after my next visit."}
{"text":"I had raved about the great experience I had at this PF Chang location the first time I went to my husband so he was dying to go. We went two weeks back and he was very impressed by the gorgeous interior just as I was and being a warm summer evening, the terrace was occupied and looked very inviting. If you aren't a fan of strong AC then you should opt for the terrace... I requested to move to a seat that wasn't under direct AC but was told all of them are :/  We had the dynamite shrimps and egg rolls for starters. For how they were described in the menu, I was disappoined by the dynamite shrimps... they were shrimps coated in a sauce that I could have made at home and presented in a cocktail glass with a piece of lettuce! For 15$ I believe, they are not worth it. However, I still found them delicious and enjoyed them a lot as well as the crispy egg rolls! For mains, my husband ordered the salt and pepper fried shrimps with spicy stir fried green beans and I had the chilli garlic shrimp noodles. Again, both were absolutely delicious and full of flavour, the level of spice was to the point. We were unable to finish, despite thinking we didn't order enough!  The last time I had been, I had tried the banana egg rolls and chocolate cake for dessert. I had enjoyed them a lot last time but this time, I just didn't have space for more!   I can relate to the negative reviews about this place, especially if you have tried other locations around the world. The standards here are lower and service is slow if you come at peak time. The first time I visited, we had a waiter with a lot of attitude who scorned if he wasn't happy with the amount of tips each of us gave. I also find the menu overpriced for the quality you receive, I guess you are mainly paying for the ambiance and upkeep of the place."}
{"text":"Nothing less than 5 star, for my fav Mong Beef, spicy chicken house fav and lettuce wrap. Yet, that is all I order b/c I like it that much!!!!  Oh ya, some great choc cake goes with that. Mmm, Im getting hungry!"}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone could remotely consider this \"Chinese\" food. PF Changs is a disgrace, just another hyped-up restaurant catered to ignorant Americans who don't know any better. Go to Beijing or Hong Kong and ask for a lettuce wrap, when they laugh in your face, tell them that PF Changs said it was authentic."}
{"text":"Came in during lunch with my mother in law and was seated immediately by a nice looking waiter. 20 minutes later left without being asked for our drinks didn't even get water. The gentleman seated next to us was waiting for someone and when she showed up a few minutes later they got their order placed within minutes of her arrival. We even got up and spoke with the hostess about getting someone to come to us and she said oh OK and still nobody showed."}
{"text":"As a foodie, I usually prefer local places instead of chains. However, PF Changs does a really good job for a chain restaurant. This location is very well managed. Inside, it has modern Asian themed decor, and is a bit more upscale than other chain restaurants. It's fairly loud inside, especially later in the evening.  Our server was above average. Better than most chains, yet nothing that really said \"wow.\"  The seared tuna was solid. Served traditional style with sesame seeds, ponzu sauce, and chives. The tuna was fresh and cooked properly.  I had a cup of egg drop soup, which was also a solid choice. It had a good amount of eggs in it, and wasn't overly salty like a lot of places.  For my entree, I had orange chicken with white rice. The chicken was moist and flavored appropriately. It was all white meat with no grit. The steamed rice was a good accompaniment. Portion sizes are generous here, making it very affordable."}
{"text":"Bel immeuble, beau restaurant, bonne bouffe asiatique et excellent rapport qualité prix. Septique avant d'y aller mais agréablement surpris!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Everything here is fresh and tasty. Their egg rolls, dumplings/pot stickers, signature lettuce wraps are all great appetizers. I've never had a bad dish here. Their walnut shrimp with melon dish is my go to! Great service and food. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Pretty much the same each time. Wait staff are nice (except one guy who is so shmoozy and a loud talker), food is consistent and generally good. We came here on a whim after a bad experience with the hostess at benihana, and we got in after 15 mins. The food came out kinda slow, but the dessert with the bananas and ice cream was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Visited this place during a blizzard which proved to be a smart move as parking was great and the place was half empty.  The most impressive thing? Our appointment at 7 PM was actually respected! (PF Chang LAVAL, I'm looking at you!)  Like the Laval location, esthetically the place is very chic and warm.  Once our congregation of friends all arrived, we started our order process... or lack thereof. I'm unsure if the staff was limited on this night but once again we were on the receiving end of some real poor service. We order our drinks and they come half an hour later. Does a few sodas and some warm sake make it acceptable to wait this long?  Eventually we got served our drinks and we quickly ordered our plates, I took the much promoted chicken in lettuce wraps and the legendary Mongolian beef.  The appetizers arrived relatively quickly (thankfully!) and since I was hungry enough to eat an Ethiopian child, I tore into the chicken in lettuce wraps.... only to be quite disappointed that the chicken was actually pretty bland and the lettuce leaves still relatively soaking in water. Neither I nor my wife were able to finish this. We waited for our mains.  The warm sake was shared between my friend and I and as always hit the spot after enduring the Canadian winter outside.  Afterwards, we waited well over 45 minutes to receive our plates and they did the biggest taboo, serve us 5 of our 6 main meals. We looked at each other apprehensively as we waited for his plate to come. 2 minutes later my friend encouraged us to dig in... what a charitable soul... watching us eat our meals while he waited almost 10 more minutes for his meal, that had been \"forgotten\". Really?  Let's discuss the legendary Mongolian beef... so... what happened to it? Why was the portion already smaller than the portion served at another location that was small enough as it is? Also, let's chill on the salt folks. I recognize this isn't a buffet styled place but for $20, I'd like a decent sized plate, preferably not being drenched in salt. Lots of water was drunk.  I didn't opt for a dessert and I settled for filtered coffee since the barista couldn't work the broken espresso/cappuccino machine tonight. Great! In the end I ended up with nasty filtered coffee that I couldn't drink more than 2 sips.   Not wasting calories on this.  The service all night was lamentable, slow and at times impatient to downright rude (waiter said a snappy comment to one of the ladies at our table).  On a special note, the price tag is ridiculous for at best average food. How can I pay close to $90 (taxes in) for two and still leave wanting more?   I started thinking. This is bad. Was the place half empty on a Saturday night because of the b blizzard outside or the reputation of this place is finally catching up to it? Reviews on Yelp are very hit and miss... well add me to the miss list.   There are better options out there and I won't be back, at least specifically at this location."}
{"text":"I almost always get my order to go.  I require gluten free and they have several options.  I pick up my order in the bar.   I'm a little disappointed by the price increases but Costco has gift cards that help bring down the price.  I don't know what happened to the lemon chicken which was my favorite.  The Singapore Street noodles has recently changed.  We went through a period of time where the chicken and meat were poor quality but that seems to have been corrected with a new vendor.  I like the chocolate dome for dessert and it's gluten free. YUM  I am very disappointed in the price increases of late.  The side of fried rice is really expensive for the price... might as well get a full order."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food! Was seated immediately on a Sunday night. Hostess and server were attentive and friendly. Loved the meal!"}
{"text":"My daughter likes to take my mom and myself out to eat. I had not been back to PF Chang in about  a year. The wait time was about 45 minutes but I did not mind as I know their food is very good there. I had the Kaleidoscope rolls which is Ahi, salmon and kani kama. It tasted really really good. My daughter had the shaking beef and she loved it. My mom had some noodles that she loved also. I need to remember how good the food is there so I can come back more often."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful meal the night before an decided to order some take out the next day 01/11/2018. I called to place the exact same thing I ordered last night and the woman that answered the phone stated that I could not get my fried rice without egg but could change it to a vegetable fried rice. I explained to the woman that the night before I was able to get fried rice without egg but I would take it as Vegetable fried rice. I asked the woman what type of veggies were in the rice and she responded it's 2 vegetables. I then asked her \"what kind of veggies\" she said she didn't know. Instead of arguing with the woman I just asked her to cancel the order. I work at PayPal and we give you guys a lot of business. Please be mindful of who you have answering the phone it will cause you lose business."}
{"text":"Sad and disgusted I will never come here again...  I went for the first time to Pf Changs last night with the suspicion that I shouldn't because I hardly ever eat at chains because they are generally overpriced, over-hyped and have poor quality of food while trying to pretend that it is so hip. Boy was I ever right and this just goes to tell you that you should always listen to that little voice in the back of your head instead of the louder one in your stomach. Instead of going to a noodle house where everything is made fresh my partner and I opted to come here because it was in the parking lot of the mall where we were and he was ravenous.   Decor is nice et cetera, et cetera, and I ordered a glass of Malbec and some spring rolls. When the rolls arrived, they looked like they came out of the freezer bag and the sauce tasted like it did too. Not only that, but they did not even taste as good as the freezer rolls do lol. Completely void of taste and the only highlight was the arrival of my slightly chilled Malbec.  I ordered the vegetable lo mein and my partner ordered the mongolian beef. His arrived looking fine, nothing extraordinary and mine arrived looking like someone had gone out and purchased one of those Yakisoba noodle packs and just plopped it into a white plate. It didn't come with any rice and the lame oil and pepper trio they tout wasn't very good. The broccoli was undercooked and it was completely void of flavor. I was so pissed off that for a small ass portion which sucks by the way, they charge you $9 which you could get somewhere else at a mom and pop operation for about a buck less and it tastes so much better.  Good service but that's not enough to save their lackluster food, maybe just this one in Chandler sucks. Either way, I don't really want to find out."}
{"text":"Overrated and HORRIBLE service from the get go. We waited to be seated an HOUR and TWENTY MINUTES! Never got seated and the snobby little hostesses there show absolutely no compassion when we went to give the pager back. We would NOT be attempting to dine there EVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I have to tell you that as many times as I've been here in different locations and eating different dishes I've never been dissapointed! This time around after eating burgers, ribs, cups and cups of beer at the Phoenix Open and Chick Fil A I was in the mood for something healthy. I had that ginger salmon cuz I wanted something healthy and I was craving fish, lobster or oysters settled on fish and I gotta tell you it was something special. I wasn't really all that hungry because of all the appitizers I was munching on but at the end of the meal the plate was empty.  Changs needs no introduction. They're good at what they do and everything else just kinda falls into place."}
{"text":"I'm not going to judge you for eating at PF Changs, after all, I did eat at Pei Wei two nights ago-thus the 2 stars, not just one. However, I did wake up the next morning with the shits.. maybe I oughta rethink that extra star!"}
{"text":"Ate here for a work event and while it definitely had space for a big group the food left a lot to be desired. The wait staff was attentive and always checking to see if we needed anything and the on tap beer selection was decent. I just wish they had more along the line of tastier food. Wasn't a huge fan of the honey chicken (overpriced in my opinion for what you got)."}
{"text":"I do like PFC.  I had the pork pot stickers and the shaking beef.  Quite yum,  It wasn't until my buddy received his dish (mongolian beef) that I realized his dish was what I wanted to order.  Oh well.  The beef lettuce wraps are worth ordering too - fairly scrumptious.  Ya feel me?"}
{"text":"To put you in context,  PF Chang is a big chain of restaurant in the US and you can find their most popular meals in supermarkets and stores like Target in the US. When you walk in, the restaurant is huge and nicely decorated. The menu offers a wide variety of chinese meals. The lettuce wrap is a classic appetizer, you get lettuce leafs and a mix of vegeterian or chicken and crispy noodles and you basically stuff the lettuce,  roll it and eat it. Another popular appetizer is the dynamite shrimps. In the main courses,  Mongolian beef,  pepper steack and  Changs chicken. Its the kind of restaurant that enjoy more when you are a large group because you can order many different meals and share."}
{"text":"I've only been to a couple of P.F. Chang's locations, and this one is equivalent to the other.     The selection of food is great.  On this late lunch stop a few days ago, I elected a lunch combo with a sushi roll plus a couple of crab wontons.  It was quite frankly the perfect size for lunch and considering I was eating sushi at a respectable restaurant, it was priced very reasonably.   The roll was good.  I love sriracha, and this roll used it inventively.  The crab wontons were also quite good.  I love those things and I could have eaten 20 more of them :).      I enjoyed the meal and my Tsingtao was ice cold.     The restaurant was mostly empty.   While my meal arrived quickly -- IE the sushi chef prepared it quickly -- I would not say the remainder of the service was as quick as I would have expected.      All told, this was a good lunch.   I would definitely go back to this PF Chang's, and I would not hesitate to stop in at other PF Chang's locations in other cities on my travels."}
{"text":"To be honest I'm not a huge Asian food fan.  But my orange chicken was not all that great.  Some of the pieces of chicken were scary and a bit suspect.  And my waiter wasn't the most attentive.  It is a nice place with a neat atmosphere."}
{"text":"With all of the great Chinese food that Montreal has to offer, PF struggles in terms of food quality, service and ambiance. If you're looking for a deeply westernized, fast food version of Chinese this might suit your palate."}
{"text":"I am tardy in writing this review. A couple of weeks ago our combined family's dined at the Chandler PF Chang's location. We were celebrating my son's birthday.The server If I recall was Janessa and she was fantastic. The manager, Mike stopped by the table to assure our satisfaction. The food (As always) was great. Our experience was perfect! Again, our server was wonderful. My grandson's loved her attention and we never lacked or looked for anything! Thank You PF Chang's staff for a very good evening."}
{"text":"P.F. Changs used to be the place to go for unique and flavorful Asian/ American cuisine. Not anymore!  Over time this groundbreaking restaurant chain has slowly declined.  It is sad because it WAS a great place to eat. Now corporate cutbacks and shortcuts along with the  gradual substitution of cheaper sauces and meats have rendered this eatery a mere shadow of its former self.  We tolerated it for sometime but most recently it became intolerable. Coincidentally the boys upstairs have released a frozen for supermarket consumers version of the recipes. It is marketed under the P.F. Changs name.              Frozen food!..Yuck. I might as well stay in, save money and put in a Marie Calendars or P.F. Changs TV dinner.   Did you not see  The movie \"Ratatouille\"? This is the kiss of death."}
{"text":"Great food both order in and dine in, we eat here when we can some of these items are a little greasy but the chocolate cake is huge beer prepared."}
{"text":"Amazing lettuce wraps and tiramisu! Much better than the Mesa location."}
{"text":"Great night. Awesome food. Yummy drinks and they made my cousins birthday a night to remember. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious hot food...everything on the menu is yummy!! My husband and I love the egg rolls with spicy peanut mustard dipping sauce. We share the spicy chicken noodle soup which comes in a big ceramic pot and ladle.  It has about 4 to 5 servings of soup."}
{"text":"First off our waitress told us there was a drink special, a cucumber collins, when we asked what the price was she looked in the drink menu for a minute and told us $10...if it was on special, why was it the normal listed price?  We also asked for the sauce trio with gluten free soy sauce, we were only brought the soy sauce and had to ask again for the rest of the trio.  Lastly, when our food was brought out we were given lunch portions. We were expecting the larger plates to share since we were never given a lunch menu and never asked for the lunch size. Our waitress also didn't confirm the lunch portions she entered.  This wasn't my first time at this location, there always seems to be these kind of issues. The waitstaff just doesn't seem very well versed in the menu or specials which can lead to mistakes with the order"}
{"text":"It was so busy on Mother's Day and I can't give the staff enough credit for being so great. Sam, and her hostess crew were very accommodating to my brother and his wheelchair access needs. Holly, our server for the evening, was so polite and had everything under control amidst the craziness.  We had 2 sweet and sour entrees that were better than any local Chinese restaurants. The stars of the show were the Mongolian beef and the Buddha's feast. The MB is crisp and tender. The Buddha's feast had delicious tofu and shiitake mushrooms. I don't know how PF Chang's keeps doing a great job but it's nice the consistency is across all the locations."}
{"text":"Just a 3 star review this time due to the unhappy service we received from the hostess and waitress Alicia. And then we had to send one of appetizers back. The manager was nice at least and our lunches were tasty."}
{"text":"I love PF Changs and this location is good but the service sucks, I had one server actually have the nerve to say he is too busy and hand me off to another server who was also to busy. Here's an idea, have enough staff to cover your Friday night supper rush. Must be a rude Quebec bad service thing. I've been to this location before and it's usually good but this is not cool."}
{"text":"I was impressed with Pf changs. A finer way of enjoying Chinese food much better improvement than a panda or pei wei . Waiters and waitresses are friendly , professional and very helpful. It's prices are higher but it seems to be a bit better quality of Chinese food ."}
{"text":"I don't often write reviews, but I felt I had to write about my experience this evening. I wanted to say a huge thank you to the manager of this establishment, Mike. I ordered dinner for my niece and her husband, as they are new parents, four days to be exact, and they wanted P.F. Chang's for dinner. He went above and beyond to help me, as I live in Henderson Nevada, and they live in Gilbert. He was kind, and made this special request happen for me. They were extremely happy with their meal, and even tried a few new things I snuck in their order! Keep up the good work Mike, it truly shows how well you do your job!!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Staff was friendly and the food was great. Looking forward to next visit."}
{"text":"Normally 4 stars but lost a star due to the 1 hour wait for food on a night when it wasn't busy at all. Offered free desert but decided it wasn't worth another hour wait. Got a couple coupons for a free appetizer."}
{"text":"Yummy American Chinese food! Hunan Fish, Sichuan Scallop, shrimp with garlic sauce... U name it! And they serve Samuel Adams beer on draft as well as lots of other standard bar drinks, which is rare for a Chinese restaurant. As for dessert, they've got carrot cake, key lime pie etc.  The service here is really good too.   Now I totally see why PF Chang is running so successfully because of its finely culturally adjusted business model."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here yesterday. The food was delicious, they also have a nice wine selection....and our waitress was perfect. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Looooooooooonnnnnnnngggggggg wait to be seated--busy--I get it, but we had only two in our party, still 25 minutes wait even though they had ten open two seater tables. Sat down--waiter came by after 20 more minutes---we ordered right away----took another 30 minutes to get the food and they had no plates to eat on--another ten minutes to get a plate---unreal---look elsewhere for Chinese food"}
{"text":"I love PF Chang's.  I realized I hadn't written a review of the location closest to me after my hubby and I had dinner there tonight.  The food was as good as always - the great thing about this chain is their consistency.  This particular location has great service, too.  The only bad thing is that there can be a long wait and it is usually packed due to the proximity to the mall."}
{"text":"The decor is very chic. Place clean. Food was so-so and very expensive. Took the Maitai drink and it was gross. Took one of the beef plates and it was overly spicy...almost chocked on it. Probably dropped the pepper shaker in. The fried Wonton dessert was blah... The worst part was the service. Our waitress was snooty and wouldn't even make eye contact with me and was pretentious.  Dissapointed. Don't recommend.  2 stars....for decor."}
{"text":"My husbands #1 go-to, we come here whenever it's his time to pick and we had a gift card, it's on!  We always order the honey chicken with all meat/shrimp fried rice. Appetizers this visit were crab wonton and pork egg rolls.  I would eat here more often if they had a little larger portion size or egg drop soup was complimentary with entree's. It baffles me why we pay so much and the plate is overloaded with the rice noodles.  The server was polite and complemented my son on his mannerism and behavior which was lovely to hear. For $10.50 a cocktail I rather hold off for a bar or cocktail lounge, I would also suggest more drinks suited for sake, less sangria and tequila margaritas, I'll enjoy those when we eat @ Z'Tejas. 1 more suggestion for PF's is having a signature, yes the lettuce wraps are a fan fav. But I would really like to see a signature \"must have\" sake cocktail or a \"must try green tea dessert\".  Just sayin'"}
{"text":"Have you ever eaten Chinese food?  Real chinese food?  Trust me, it's not like this--this is decadent, greasy, rich American food with Chinese names.  Ma Po Tofu is not supposed to be crunchy outside, soft inside, and sweet/sour.  But here it is!  Also, don't ever order a coctail or drink not on their menu.  I got an unlayered B-52 in a brandy glass.  More like a Yak-2."}
{"text":"Had a night out with family, made a reservation and were seated promptly. Food was very enjoyable and from ordering to delivery seemed quite quick.   Waiter was friendly but not overbearing, kept us refilled with drinks promptly. Definitely a place I would eat again"}
{"text":"I wish I had talked to the manager. The 3 hostess were horrible. We came at 7:15 and we were told 30 minutes for 2. We watched group after group come in and be seated before us. Without a reservation too. We went up to the hostess and asked what the deal was and she told us there were 5 groups ahead of us. We were the only people that had been there for 45 minutes. No one that was there was before us. I will never go to here again and I would gladly like to talk to the manager about how those 3 hostess did their job and treated us."}
{"text":"Average overall. But they have a Scorpion issue outside!!!   Came here for a quick date night. Nothing special but haven't been in years and thought why not.   First off, if you come to this location during Fri/Sat night. Be prepared to wait. Like 1hr for a table for two kind of wait.   And while the food was good; it was not wait 1 hr for a table good.    They have plenty of waiting/seating outside (no way I'd wait during the inferno summer) but this night is was nice out with a breeze so we waited.  While waiting  BE WARNED!! They clearly have a Scorpion problem outside.  While waiting along the small wall in front we notice two dead Scorpions right there at out feet.  Hard to tell if they were dead from being stepped on or sprayed first. Either way not a good sign.  We move to another area just to be safe and what do you know.  Two more dead ones along the wall. So be careful/ mindful of your hands/feet and little ones.   Once inside our service was excellent. No issues there. Waiter was great, attentive, and friendly.   Ordered the orange peel chicken and the avocado lobster roll. They were ok and not bad but nothing great either. Could have had the same quality at Pei Wei. Don't think I'll go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"Used to be loyal customer and happy with the restaurant in Chandler until recently. Be aware that they miss your entrée in your TO GO. When I came back for missing entrée the other day, the restaurant manager treated me like I was cheater. I have more problem with this particular manager than the restaurant itself. But I still feel pf Chang should select better person for their reputation."}
{"text":"Date Night with the hubby (we treated ourselves with the extra gift card PF Chang's offers for holiday special during Black Friday)! The food seemed to be just ok since the last couple visits. Ordered the same things pretty much - Dynamite shrimp, chicken pad thai and Chang's chicken. My husband felt Chang's chicken could've been spicer but it was perfect for me as spice level goes. I had the coconut cooler again and it is still one of my favorite non-alcoholic drinks. I gave an extra star this time because of our service. Tanya was great! She was really sweet and attentive. I will definitely request her next time I come back."}
{"text":"Blah. I love love love PF Changs (until last night). Used to live in Scottsdale and would order from the Camelback location ALL the time. I've ordered twice at this location now that I live in Chandler. We have our regular dishes we always order: chicken lettuce wraps, beef lo mein, shrimp lo mein & side of white rice. I worked all day yesterday (Easter) so decided to order my favorite Chinese takeout PF Changs since they were open and I didn't feel like cooking. I really wish I hadn't. Our lo mein was very overlooked and pretty much tasteless. I forced myself to eat my shrimp and veggies since I paid $30+ for this food, although my husband could barely get through a quarter of his beef lo mein. The best part of the meal was the plain white rice. My husband called to complain. We order the same thing all the time and never have we had mushy overlooked noodles. They manager could have cared less.  He asked if we wanted them to remake it but by that time we were home and grossed out. He says thanks for calling and hung up. Didn't even offer us a free meal next time to make up for it. We will not be back to this location EVER."}
{"text":"The restaurant manager here is rude, he told me that I need to enunciate my words Because he couldn't understand if I said Erin or Eric. Ok, how is it my fault that you can't understand what I'm saying in a crowded ass restaurant. I was only in there to pick up my order, so in less than a few minutes of being there he managed to insult me and lose my interest of ever recommending P.F. Chang's to anyone ever"}
{"text":"Where to start ... My wife had visited this location with her girlf friends and she kept telling me we have to go eat there ... Some other relative visited the Dubai location and kept telling me how amazing their experience was .. So tonight my wife and I both decided to get some asian food for dinner .. The buiding is very nice from the outside, stands out from the classic restaurant looks, the 2 horses at the entrance are quiet HUGE AND IMPRESSIVE , when i entered I didnt know where too look the decor is gorgeous the ceiling is very high and in front of you there is a second floor in a mezzanine type.. Allot of spicy, gluten free, veggy and sea food options  We had shrimps, prawns, eggrolls, greenbeans, noodles, the portions are quiet generous. They really didnt cheap out of the amount of shrimps - justifies the cost of each plate :)  All ingredients were fresh and flavorful  We will go back again for sure, we were so full we werent able to order dessert but the banana eggroll with ice cream was really tempting, the temperature was a bit on the chilly side but the terrase seemed lovely, nice outdoor furniture and high walls made it very intimate and private  Montrealers should feel proud as there are only 2 locations in Canada ; montreal and laval  The owners are also local investors, lets encourage them and allow them expand, its definately nice"}
{"text":"I have been to PF Changs before, but not to this specific location.  I dined here on Sunday night, and it was a pleasure as always.  We were seated right away, and the place is pretty big and well laid out.  Had a decent crowd for a Sunday night, and our service was great!  you can actually see this location from the road, making it easy to find, and parking was a breeze.  I ordered the Sweet and sour chicken.  I forgot what my date ordered, but both dishes were good.  I upgraded this time, and got the fried rice...with shrimp!  Food came out in a decent amount of time.  Server was smart, friendly, and did not make us feel rushed.  My serving of shrimp fried rice was HUGE!  Did I also mention that it was tasty?  Sweet and sour chicken was done just right, and it was tasty!  I would definately return here, and was happy with my experience at this PF Changs location."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience here. Our son is a very picky eater, but he ate so much here! The lettuce wraps are always delicious and the lunch specials are a really great deal. It's a large restaurant with a warm and inviting atmosphere. Can't wait to bring the little one back here again!"}
{"text":"Food was typical changs. I ordered tofu in a veteran plate.  Tofu was so small i almost missed it.  Looks like pepper.  Anyways the highlight was coconut ice cream and banana egg rolls."}
{"text":"Just don't bother. Service sucks. We stopped here for a late lunch on our way to airport. After the hostess sat us we waited at our table for a full 10 min witout so much as someone saying hello or even acknowledging that we'd been seated in their section. I asked the hostess if we had a waiter. She went to the back to try the find \"her\". It was obvious the waiter was not around so... We went to the bar thinking we could get immediate service there?. Just before we sat down the bar tender walked off. We waited another 5 min which may seem short but is a long time in the restaurant industry. He didn't come back.  I was really craving lettuce wraps but my husband insisted we leave. On our way out I told the hostess we couldn't get any service so we were going to just leave. She didn't try to stop us or apologize. My husband stayed back to speak with her and the waiter that had been hanging out at the hostess stand. It was not pleasant. The hostess didn't seem bothered at all. Never apologized, never offered to get her manager, etc. What a waste."}
{"text":"While my experience with P.F. Changs is usually based on their takeout, last night my mother-in-law and I had a rare evening together and chose to eat in the restaurant.  We arrived around 6:00 PM on Friday night, and the place was very crowded already - a large party of 35 was taking up much of the table space so nobody was going anywhere for a while.  Nevertheless, the greeting staff were all calm, polite and cheerful, and we put in our name, were told we'd wait about 35 minutes, and headed for the bar.  Our bartender was a hoot, and gave us terrific service while we stood behind other patrons at the bar.  When our table was called (35 minutes later, right on the button), we were seated and joined by our server Brianna.  Despite what clearly must have been a hectic evening for her, Brianna was calm, focused and made our experience terrific.  When our food arrived, she commented on how beautifully my Oolong-marinated sea bass had been cooked (and she was right).  She was just delightful.  A number of people checked in during our meal to make sure we were happy with everything, and the managing partner offered us his business card and suggested next time we could contact him directly and he might be able to seat us more quickly.  The only reason I can't give 5 stars is due to the noise level in the restaurant (which can't be helped given their layout).  The evening was great, the food was terrific, and Brianna was one of the best servers we've ever had.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a lousy experience!!! My family and I get there at 12 noon on a Saturday and the place is almost empty. There's no one at the front desk to greet and seat us. Theres a line of people waiting and no one to help anyone. Eight minutes goes by before a girl finally emerges from the back . She says no word of greeting to anyone. We finally sit and a waiter named Dylan comes to our table and says he'll be back \"in a minute\" to take our order. Fifteen minutes go by and he never returns to our table. I flag down the manager and he acts annoyed and asks me what I want. I tell him I'd like to order, and to take my families order first  and he starts laughing at me in a mocking tone and with a sarcastic inflection in his voice and says \"I thought you were ready to order\"!. I inform him I'm deferring to my family first to be polite and expect him to be respectful. Needless to say at this point my meal was ruined. The manager is a man in his mid forties dressed like a slob and very disrespectful. He also doesn't manage his staff, as reflected by the disappearing acts the hostess and waiter pulled in a nearly empty restaurant hanging out in the back instead of attending to their customers. and with the disrespectful attitude that manager imposed on me.They have the gall to call this a top level restaurant. You'd receive better service at a Dennys."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since we've been to PF Chang's, not sure why, but it was good. It's a little pricey (for quantity) but the quality is in the food. Customer service ok, I think our server was new. We had to ask for salsa that they're supposed to offer. There was something hard like rock in the rice. We were charged for soda water and we weren't advised, deducted it from tip. We'll eat again at PF Chang's, overall the food and quality good."}
{"text":"I feel quite bored when I review an average place and give my average 3 points to it. But unfortunately there are just so many of them! The dishes are expensive and average. The service is average. They forget most of the times the little details/specifics you have asked for. Until you remind them again! It is an overly priced chinese bistro.  I only went there because I was forced to pick up a fancy resto for a business meeting in that locality."}
{"text":"Bottom line: over priced... but is it because the Chinese food has less value than a steak???  2 people for lunch: 62$ (including taxes and tip) 1 main dish:  Mongolian beef - very good 2 lunch specials:  Chang's spicy chicken - good pepper beef - very good  Looks like a lot but it is not that much...  Service is nice Atmosphere is nice"}
{"text":"Ive tried this place twice now and while one experience was slightly better than the other, my overall impression remains pretty much the same. The good points are that the location is large and elegant inside, lots of space even for larger groups and its clean. There is lots of parking outside and it is also within a few minutes walk from Namur metro.  However, Service is always slow and sort of inattentive and forgetful (even though the restaurant was nowhere near full).  I've had a few different items on their menu, from the green beans, to the sushi (spicy tuna) , Dynamite shrimp , chicken dumplings , orange beef , Singapore noodles , dessert wontons (to name a few), since we went with a group and ordered a few items to share so we can try a bit of everything. The portion sizes were good enough but my issue was more with the quality of the food for the price you pay. None of these dishes was anything more than just okay at best, except the sushi, which was actually fresh&tasty, but still not worth the price. They all lacked in proper flavor and some were way over salted and some way under salted.   I honestly don't think I would be going back here by choice and I am also not sure I would recommend it to others, way overrated/overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"We went to P. F. Chang's last night and I was really impressed with their service and of course the food. When we walked in, it was obvious there was a wait. We were pretty hungry and almost left, but the two hostesses working were just so sweet that we decided to wait it out anyways (which turned out to only be around 10 minutes). One of them even checked on us a couple of times and told us that there was only one person in front of us and we were next. Such a sweetheart. Our server was Claire and she was just as sweet! Usually when restaurants are busy, you can tell the servers are stressed out and they tend to kind of rush you to make a decision, but she was the exact opposite. We ended up deciding on the chicken lettuce wraps and split the Mongolian Beef. NOM! It was so good. I wish we had leftovers because I can't stop thinking about the deliciousness that was P. F. Changs! The manager, Mike, is a very very nice man, too which I think must rub off on all of his employees. Great food and amazing service. I have NOTHING to complain about!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner and it really was a great experience!  We sat at the bar and had Lindsay and Louie serving us.  We ordered potstickers that were really good.  Cooked perfectly!  We ordered Kung Pao chicken extra spicy and a side of fried rice.  King Pao was extra Spicy and delicious!  Lindsay and Louie were on top of our orders and drinks.  Checking to make sure we were happy and satisfied with everything.  Great food and super great service!  We will definitely go back thanks to the service!"}
{"text":"Best service I have had in years. Took a party of 7 there. Never an empty glass. Seated promptly. Food was good. Will definitely go again.  Tip well because they deserve it with their service. Skip the dump tepenyaki place down the road and get a real meal."}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese food I have had here. Was there with my colleague. Honestly don't remember the name of the dish but it was a lunch special chicken with melon and white rice. Also had coconut cooler drink with it. Will definitely keep going there for I loved the dish, ambience and service."}
{"text":"Nice chinese 2.0 restaurant with good choice, great service and atmosphere. A bit pricey for what it is, but good restaurant to go on a last minute dinner with or without kids"}
{"text":"The service was good, the food was delicious. The only thing I can complain about is the pricing.  I spent 18$ on a tiny bowl of rice, and a small plate of mongolian chicken.  No drink, just water.   Although I really enjoyed the food at my stay there, this is not a place I can visit again anytime in the future, when I'm left hungry after paying 20$ for a tiny meal."}
{"text":"Just went to PF Changs for lunch sat there for 15 minutes not one person came to our table to bring us a water or take our order.   Got up and asked the hostess if she could have somebody come to our table she wandered off never even came back to our table sat there for five more minutes we got up and left. They weren't even busy there were at least 15 tables in there that were empty it was like we were in the no-fly zone. There was a man sitting next to us waiting for somebody to arrive when she came in the waitress went right up to the table brought them their drinks took their order and walked off again. If this restaurant could get a minus one star that's what I would give it."}
{"text":"Disgustingly disgusting :))) I've been at PF Chang's in California , also New York you can't compare it its a very bad food iam % 100 sure they are just waiting for the lease to finish this restaurant not going to last , location is great. Iam sure initially when they opened up this place mainly they want to serve TMR area after all it's a high income area but the food is so bad nobody want to come here ,because iam sure most of there clients been in this  restaurant in states  and see the difference,restaurant it self is beautiful but you see hardly any clients in here , service ? Sucks , food? Is very very very bad , this place should close down and some kind of a high end steakhouse should be opened up , with minimal restorations this place can be a beautiful steakhouse and then it'll start making money ( in the last 3 years we've been here at this restaurant 4 times and everything is getting worse and worse ) Regards"}
{"text":"Vraiment satisfaite d'avoir opté pour ce restaurant pour souligner la fête des pères! Mes parents parlent déjà d'y retourner!  Nous avons trouvé dommage que certains néons ne fonctionnent pas au plafond, ça enlevait du chic à un décor autrement impeccable, très \"steak-house\". Les banquettes sont confortables et donnent le goût de s'y attarder...  Trois entrées à partager et trois plats principaux, c'était généreux même pour des gourmands comme nous. Ça m'a fait un très beau lunch le lendemain au travail! Notre serveur a eu la gentillesse de nous séparer les restes dans deux beaux plats pour emporter, que je pourrai même réemployer pour d'autres lunchs puisqu'ils sont lavables et qu'ils vont au micro-ondes. C'est un détail qui compte. D'ailleurs ce serveur (Hanan, Hanam, je m'excuse, j'ai oublié!) a été super agréable tout au long de ses interactions avec nous. Il a été sympathique dans sa prise des commandes et dans son service en général. Il était également attentif à remplir nos verres d'eau et à desservir les plats. Les plats principaux ont suivi les entrées dans un délai raisonnable.  Les haricots verts style tempura ont fait le bonheur de tout le monde. Ajoutez-les à votre repas sans hésiter!  Je pense que comme expérience de cuisine fusion chinoise nord-américaine, c'est un restaurant très bien et accessible à ceux qui ne mangent pas de \"mets exotiques\" ou qui ont des restrictions alimentaires (options sans gluten ou végétariennes indiquées sur le menu). Pour les autres, eh bien c'est un peu cher pour ce que c'est, mais c'est bon."}
{"text":"Vegetarians and Vegans, I just don't think this place is for you. A little pricey, a little chain-ey if that's a word, but the food never disappoints. Been coming here with family for many years. Always a popular birthday choice."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad PF Changs meal until I was in Chandler and visited for lunch.  Both of us at our table agreed that this was the worst PF Changs meal we had ever had.  Mongolian beef had a strange aftertaste. Wasn't cooked the same way as usual.  The Honey Chicken wasn't even crispy.  Service was also slow and not very professional."}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to have a night out without the baby and we hadn't been in a while. Everything was up to par, server was polite and attentive, atmosphere was pleasant, and the food quality didn't disappoint. I always appreciate when I ask for a special order, I wanted to add shrimp to my dish, and the don't seem to mind. We were pleasantly surprised with the tempura green bean appetizer. Mains were tasty and by the time we got to desert we were pretty full with leftovers. We decided to get a small cobbler and a lava cake, both were pretty small but they were perfectly sized for our stuffed selves. Overall, still a nice place to take a date out on a Friday night. If it's been a while, you'll enjoy it just as much as you remember."}
{"text":"Crowded every time I've gone, but it's worth the wait. The first major down side is parking is limited. If you go on the weekend, be prepared to walk. You will likely wait quite a while for a table too. The pepper steak is wonderful, but it is SPICY! I had to ask for a mild version. Figured that out the hard way.... And it is spicier the second day! I ended up with a blister on my tongue because of the spice. Mild version = awesome!"}
{"text":"I generally don't write reviews about chains that I rarely visit, but sometime rely on when I in a pinch while travelling... but this was just to classic to not share for posterity...   Sit down at the bar (you know travelling by myself) - looked like the right spot with appropriate elbow room for Me, Myself, and I, but lo and behold picked the spot with the dark mushroom on the counter, and the sticky hidden mess where I put my rental car keys.  Nice enough waitress/bartendress offers me a drink, I get a slightly chilled (54 degress perhaps) Malbec, which was good.  Ordered my peculiar dish (the only reason I ever come to this chain) - stock velvet Kung Pao with loads of veggies added to make it almost healthy (minus the heartache inducing sodium levels).  Figured it would be all normal like it usually is in a chain like this....  consistency for the sake of authenticity and the fact that Chandler is almost devoid of good cuisine.  First dish out - fast.  No veggies, they send it back... back in 5 minutes, chicken is not stock velvet, I didn't notice at first... waitress did, plates sent back... 10 minutes later.... food now in front of me to consume.  No problem, I can handle two screw ups, I will be gone soon from this place.  However my journey has just begun....   Young manager comes by, says sorry I talked to the \"chef\" and chucks a free appetizer card at me.  Good only for Chandler...  I let the waitress know later in a nice manner that they can keep it, because I don't live here.  She says oh, let me get you something else.  Then ensues some discussion with suave young manager and older manager..  older manager comes by and tells me that being that I didn't order an appetizer I couldn't redeem the appetizer card.  He repeats this twice because I couldn't fathom that he would be saying that the card that they just gave me, which I didn't want, I was now in trouble for trying to use???  He finally understands my confusion... and says, oh I will be back.  He comes back with a appetizer card I could use anywhere in the world!!! Yippeeee!!  And then he gives me his card in case I have trouble getting a table when I want to use the appetizer card back home - because he opened all the restaurants up there.  Trouble getting a table at PF Changs?????? !  I left going holy mother of cows, then I saw the UFOs over Phoenix and realized I was in the Twilight zone."}
{"text":"Very sad to see the SEVERE LACK of Customer Service. We had a server who knew NOTHING about the drinks from the bar. WE asked her three times if the had T-Ten Gin. She could not seem to find out. We requested a new server and that was not fun either. Sean the server had a BAD attitude because he took our table over. THIS IS  THE WORST CHANG's  FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. We have gone to PF CHANGS since it began in Scottsdale. WAY TO GO  TO DESTROY BRAND LOYALTY!!!!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy P.F. Changs when I visit. They offer a special for two people: a choice of soup for each person, one select appetizer, a choice of select entrees, and banana spring rolls for dessert. I always order the lettuce wraps to start... You honestly can't go wrong with these. They are so tasty and come with chicken and a sweet soy sauce and ice berg lettuce. I'm sure you could make this dish vegetarian friendly. We also enjoy the California rolls here (yes, they have sushi! Don't judge my Cali rolls). For my dinner entree, I generally order Chang's spicy chicken with brown rice. The chicken has a spicy and sweet sauce over the delicious fried pieces. The Lo mein with chicken is also amazing if you love noodle dishes! My mom describes it as buttery in consistency... Delicious with lots of veggies. But the real deal here at P.F. Changs is none other than what is offered for dessert... The banana spring rolls and coconut pineapple ice cream! Please save room for this. My mom and I had no shame after stuffing our faces... We needed this in our lives. The spring rolls are filled with banana and fried to the utmost perfection. The coconut pineapple ice cream has to be the most delicious ice cream I have ever had... Paired with the spring rolls, it is to die for. I highly recommend these. The ambiance here is rather intimate but casual and offers low lighting for a romantic night out with a lucky individual. Cocktails offered here are interesting but a bit too \"fluffy\" as my mom would say. I just order a glass of house Chardonnay and I'm peachy keen for the night. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Every single time I set foot in this place I leave FURIOUS! The service is horrendous. The food is fine, nothing special. I got a gift card like two years ago and went in for dinner with my husband. I was disgusted by the wait, so I ordered take out instead. After waiting forever I got home and my order was wrong. I complained and was given another gift card. This time I ordered ahead and still waited 30 minutes (15 to be acknowledged, 15 for my food), but this time my order was correct at least. Then tonight I submitted my order online and then waited 15 minutes to be acknowledged and they told me they never received my order! No apology, no offer to put in an order, just \" nope, it's not here\". So I went to chipotle... Guess what, I got immediate friendly service. I'll never set foot in this restaurant again... I still have half a gift card left from 2 years ago, maybe I'll give it away or try another location. Total disaster."}
{"text":"The first time I went to PF Chang's I really liked it. The second time I went for lunch time I ordered the Sweet and Sour Chicken with rice... the chicken tasted moldy and had no flavoring, it was awful. I had a bad stomach ache after the meal and would not recommend getting this ever again."}
{"text":"4 of  us went for lunch and it was wonderful.  Stefanie, our server was great.  Loved the Hot & Sour soup, egg rolls & lettuce wraps.  We all had different entrees and we all had smiles on our faces."}
{"text":"Had my first experience with P.F. Chang's on 07/28/2017 and it will probably be my last. I got there around 5pm, right before the huge dinner rush. Let me start with the good.  PROS: 1. The server I had was great. He was very nice, professional and went out of his way to meet specific food allergies and gave the table two types of iced tea because we couldn't decide which one sounded the best.  2. The food was good. I expected it to be better than Panda Express. It was. I personally like Pei Wei and found it slightly better. Pretty much the same when it comes to price.  3. The store is really nice, clean and welcoming. Again, the big thing for me is clean.  No for the disappointment that will be the main reason why I will not return to this location  CONS 1. Staff. When I got there with my friend, it was dead. I was sitting near the bar and what appeared to be the To-Go/Dishwasher entrance to the kitchen. There must of been at least 7 staff standing around conversing, laughing and joking. Two staff in particular were looking at customers, pointing and laughing. This is not appropriate at all. The other unsettling thing about this is I had what appeared to be the dishwasher (16-17 year old guy) standing at the entrance of the dish washing area just looking at me for over 9 minutes with his red rubber gloves on watching me eat. Then another staff came up and kept looking at me with him while pointing and laughing, every single time I put food in my mouth. I was going to say something right then and there, but it got really busy and people were running around trying to get there work done.  If it wasn't for that one CON, this would have been a 4-5 star experience."}
{"text":"Good lettuce wraps, lots of selection, attentive service. Overall a good place"}
{"text":"Great interior, however the food is not the best I've eaten. Had better tasting meals in less \"fancy\" places. Would give it another try when in town, maybe:)"}
{"text":"So good. The food is so good. Service is always good too. They've changed up the presentation on the lettuce wraps. I kind of miss the sauce being mixed at the table (I like to make mine extra spicy). Love the spicy greens beans too. Delicious and worth adding."}
{"text":"Good meal, good service. The sweet and sour chicken was excellent.  Server was very patient. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The manager can't even take a To go order. He says we do not peel our peas for you and put it in your food. You can do that yourself. Really ! I eat lunch there on a weekly basis but not anymore."}
{"text":"Don't let the decor and name fool you into thinking they serve authentic Chinese cuisine however the food is enjoyable overall and it's actually kind of hard to find authentic Chinese food in Arizona anyways. It's a good place to bring friends or family and share dishes, love the Mongolian beef and honey shrimp. Our waitress Allison was friendly and we were sat and served right away even though it was busy. One thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I love PF Changs. I have never had really great service in Tempe but the location in Chandler always has terrific service. Large menu, lots of yummy and different things to choose from. The staff seem to enjoy themselves a lot. I heard one waiter telling his table that he has been with the company since 2001. Their egg drop soup is so good and you can eat off the lunch bowl menu during the day and your entree comes with the soup. We had the egg rolls today and our waitress prepared a sauce at our table-medium and it was amazing! The drinks and desserts are really good too. You can go here for a special occasion or just lunch. Most likely the manager will pop over to make sure everything is ok-and most likely, it will be!!"}
{"text":"I had the spring rolls and pad thai and my friend had dumplings and some kind of noodles. The rolls were tasteless, really no taste at all, I ate only one. The pad thai was OK, not good just OK, lack of seasoning. I had the brownie for dessert and it was good. The dumplings were cooked perfectly but there again lack of taste and nothing like traditional dumplings. Her noodles were good once she added some soy and hot sauce. She had a chocolate cake that was really good. Will not return since I can have way better for way less."}
{"text":"Went tonight for my very first experience of a PF Changs...not impressed at all. I was taken by 2 people who have been a number of times in Florida...apparently it is quite different there than here.  Where to start...decor, restaurant out of a box....I've seen these exact same faux-stone walls and columns in various restaurants around N. America and the islands...give me break. The lighting is terribly bright, I felt like I was in a cafeteria...get some different bulbs please.  Food...egg-rolls...absolutely tasteless...the only flavour came from the dipping-sauce...honey-mustard..really?  Chicken in lettuce wraps...pretty bland and gimmicky, was not impressed and would not recommend.  Main courses...mongolian beef and the sesame chicken were both good, not great but definitely worth the money and worth having. SpiceyShrimp and noodles...so overloaded with salt it was un-edible! and I'm pretty salt-tolerant!!...kudos...they did not charge us for it.  Service was friendly,efficient and fast.  Drinks...1 vodka-tonic,1mojito and 1 Tsing-tao beer no coffee, no desserts.  Cost $87. including taxes but before the tip.  My 2 friends told me the food was far better presented and much tastier at the US  PF Changs in Florida that they go to and that the decor was more upscale there also...all of which is kind of counter-intuitive in a way.  All said and done I found the $87 price for what we got to be acceptable...you get what you pay for.  I would not bother going back...the food,location and ambience just aren't worth my time or effort. If you want Chinese food there are plenty of places in Montreal with much,much better food."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour with a friend. The food was great, as was the service. There was no long wait for food or drinks and the staff was very accommodating. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had the 4 course prix fixe menu for two.  Had the hot and sour soup.  Ok.  Not great, but ok.  Had the chicken lettuce wraps.  Actually pretty good.  Had the beef and broccoli and kung pao chicken.  Beef and brccoli was ok but a tad sweet.  Chicken was pretty good.  Oddly the rice was perhaps the worst rice I've had in a \"Chinese\" restaurant in recent memory (I classify PF Changs as a Chinese restaurant in the loosest sense of the word (I guess this also assumes that there are actually any Chinese restaurants in Az)).  I can best describe it as being much like minute rice.  Had the tiramisu for desert.  Very very small serving...especially for two people."}
{"text":"On vient à plusieurs pour goûter à différents plats. C'est de la nourriture plus américaine que chinoise, c'est pas mauvais, mais rien de remarquable non plus. On compte autour de 50$ par personne si on boit autre chose que de l'eau du robinet. C'est la deuxième fois que j'y vais, le service est vraiment excellent, il surpasse les ingrédients des plats. Je ne crois pas que j'y viendrai pour une troisième fois, je sens que j'ai fait le tour et ça me laisse plutôt neutre au niveau des saveurs."}
{"text":"Where should I begin? I came here for lunch with my mom & we had such an enjoyable time. From the moment we walked in, we felt completely comfortable & welcomed. The hostess sat us immediately, which was nice because I thought we were going to have to wait since it was during the week and during lunch time.  We began with drinks & both chose non-alcoholic beverages. I ordered the strawberry & cucumber drink which was tasty! My mom opted for something more generic like her iced tea. We then ordered edamame, wontons as our appetizers. Our waitress Devn was very patient & super nice! She was really pleasant to talk too. She helped us with ideas as to what was good. My mom ordered a soup & I ordered the orange peel chicken. Both were very good. My mom also got the california roll which was just as good.  We were happy with our visit & to top it off we got a red fortune cookie because its Chinese New Year season! That was exciting!!!"}
