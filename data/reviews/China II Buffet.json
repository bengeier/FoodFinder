{"text":"China 2 is my families favorite Chinese food in town. We have tried the other newer ones but this remains our top pick.  We always order take out. I recommend it over the buffet. The fresh cooked food is best."}
{"text":"Really bad! We came for dinner buffet on a Sunday evening. There is nothing. There used to be sushi, we came for that. But now that is gone. There is literally nothing appealing. It is a shame this place dares to charge $10 per person for just rice and noodles. Too bad!!!"}
{"text":"fast, friendly service.  you can eat the Buffet or take out.   Good food, not an overwhelmeing  ton of choices but the main items you would expect to see at a chinese place.   Great for kids - price is good too,   food was better than average."}
{"text":"I order take-out here and have never been disappointed! Can't say if the buffet is any good, but they are pretty busy around normal eating times so it's gotta be pretty good."}
{"text":"I hate slamming a place but this was the worst Chinese food I've ever had and I've lived all over the U.S. We had to order 3 dishes in order to get the veggie combination we wanted. Apparently there are no additions? The Mongolian beef didn't taste or have the texture of beef. General Tso's chicken was so-so and the rice was mushy and overcooked! It has been about an hour since we ate and we both feel bloated and out of sorts. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Love coming here. Love the Food , The Service, getting in and out.  I'm not a seafood eater, but my wife is and she loved it. I loved how everything is cooked. The restrooms are very clean, the Prices are good also. I would recommendthis to anyone who wanted a good buffet at a hood price"}
{"text":"Please don't support this place! My husband just had lunch at this place. He asked the waitress if he could have 3 fresh wings because the food on the bar was cold,  the lady told him if he wanted hot wings he could go to Bojangles. My husband requested a manager.  she refused to get a manager. My husband told the waitress he didn't want the food  and got up to leave. The waitress starting yelling\" that's good go to Bojangles\"!  Horrible Horrible   Place! I truly hope this place does not represent the town of Waxhaw."}
{"text":"I recently visited for the dinner buffet with my three year old son. The buffet food was lacking and did not look appealing. My son ate 2 pieces of sweet and sour chicken and ate a few bites of fried rice. The bill for the two of us was over $18. The price is far too high for the lackluster options.   The buffet and price were honestly not the worst part of my visit. The blatant racism shown to a guest in line in front of us was. After the guest left the lady at the register actually said \"black people always act...\" I was utterly shocked and have never experienced such a thing.   I will NEVER return to this restaurant and will make sure to steer anyone away."}
{"text":"This food is pretty typical Americanized Chinese buffet. Given the other options for Chinese food in Waxhaw I wouldn't choose this over those.    The Decor could use updating. On the plus side the price was reasonable and the people were nice enough."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and delicious food! Would definitely recommend! They were so kind and took very good care of us ! Refills were prompt and anything we needed was given and very quickly."}
