{"text":"The Ultimate in fine dining!  The atmosphere, food, and staff were incredible!   What an amazing experience.   Great for a party of 10 people!  A personal \"shout out\" goes to the General Manager, Devin who was super professional and accommodating!  Thank-you for a perfect evening with family and friends.  I would recommend The Melting Pot in Ahwatukee in a heartbeat!   I can't say enough about how special it was for a special occasion in our lives."}
{"text":"The food is good and it's a different experience. That experience wasn't worth the price, though.

Service was incredibly slow - 3 hours for 6 people and we didn't even do dessert. A \"glass\" of wine is about half of what would be considered a full glass anywhere else.  They add a gratuity of 20% to tables of 5 or more so I guess our server knew she was getting paid no matter what.

I can spend $80 a person and get much better service and food that I don't have to cook elsewhere."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great experience celebrating our wedding anniversary!! Loved everything!"}
{"text":"Overall experience was excellent. Our server CJ was the best we have ever had. He was very knowledgeable on the process and the choices and had superior customer service! The food was excellent as usual and the experience was very enjoyable. We were celebrating our 25th Anniversary, so the occasion was something very important to us. CJ made it a evening to remember.\""}
{"text":"Jamie our waitress was amazing!! The food and service was incredible!!! Overall great experience, so glad my husband and I chose to spend our anniversary here ;)"}
{"text":"Prior to our evening we made a reservation online. We specified a booth for health reasons of our guests. When we were shown to our table it was a half booth, we told them requested a booth and the hostess proceeded to tell us that all of the tables have some booth so we should have called to specify. If I wanted to call I would have made my reservation that way. After arguing she led us to a full booth. Strike One

After being given menus I asked about the endless fondue, the all you can eat. Our server said that it was a living social deal and not available to us. After looking on my phone at living social I told him I didn't think he was correct and THEN we were given a special menu for the endless fondue. Strike Two

While ordering the endless fondue we were told to pick ANY cheese, cooking style and dessert. No mention was given to any upcharges for our choices and yet when the bill came we were charged for our \"special\" choices outside of the deal. Strike Three

We have been going to the Melting Pot for years and never had such bad service. The bill was about $30 more than expected due to staff not knowing their own offers. We sure didn't feel welcome. They are out of our restaurant choices now.

P.S. one of us, the vegetarian, left disappointed and hungry.

****UPDATE**** The manager contacted me and made me an offer:
 I would like to drop a couple of gift certificates to you in the mail. What happened on your visit is not what we do, or who we are. If you could reply with your address, I will get them in the mail this week.

****UPDATE****** received the \"gift certificates\"....they were coupons that required two entree and two cheese fondue purchases to be used....NO THANK YOU."}
{"text":"Valentine's Day 2010...time for a romantic dinner with my husband and since I'd never been to Melting Pot before, he thought it was the perfect day to go. 

The first thing I noticed when we were walking up was the balloon arch and red carpet (taped to the ground with red duct tape!). While I appreciated the effort, it came across cheesy (and cheap) for a restaurant that I presume to be higher class than the average. Once inside, we saw how incredibly dim the lights were. Almost like a cave! I love mood lighting, but it was way too dark to be romantic...it felt more like bed-time than sexy-time, lol.

Once we were seated our server introduced herself and was informative about the menu & how the meal would progress/cook/etc. Maybe she wasn't as friendly as we would have liked, but that wasn't a deal breaker. I've had chocolate fondue before, but have never experienced a full-course meal. We went with the swiss cheese starter. Great flavor, but the garlic over-powered the fondue. I did enjoy trying out the taste of the apples, grapes, and tiny pickles in it (along with the bread) though. Next, we chose salads...I went with the California while my husband had the Chef's. My salad was so flavorful and tasty! I really liked the sweet and vinegar combination. Hubby said his salad was \"ok\". 

Following the salads, we selected the meat entree over the seafood. Our cooking style was the boullion broth. It came with chicken, two types of beef, shrimp, and ravioli. With the exception of one of the beef choices, they were all delicious. They even came with several sauce and veggie options. For dessert, we decided on the basic milk chocolate fondue. The strawberries, pineapple, brownie bites, cheesecake bites, and pirouettes were a perfect way to end the meal, although the two marshmellow choices were too sugary to enjoy. Even though all the portion sizes were small, we were so stuffed that we couldn't finish our meat and dessert courses.

We really appreciated our server offering sparkling apple cider for our complimentary V-Day toast instead of champagne. 

When the check came, it was over $200 and we were surprised to see an automatic 18% gratuity added on (and then there was a space for an additional tip too). My husband has always been an awesome tipper, so that was a sour note in an otherwise sweet dinner. A cute touch to the holiday was that an employee came by during dinner, took our picture, and put it in a frame and then we picked it up on the way out. 

Overall, it was a romantic and delightful meal, but if we ever go back again it will only be for a special once a year dinner or just for dessert."}
{"text":"Ok, it is probably very rare that I will be handing out 5 stars that much because I'm just like that but this place really deserves it!!!!! Can I say heeelllllllloooooo heaven!!! I might have to say this is the first time I cleaned my plate (and pot). This place has just the right atmosphere for a good night out. The food was excellent and so was our waiter! I would be in trouble if they ever put one closer to me!!! Some people may say that their portions are too small but I have to differ, I never go home hungry and I never leave with that gut wrenching feeling of over eating!!!!
I would take out a second mortgage and eat here every night!!!!"}
{"text":"The whole negative experience started with my initial phone call to set up a very, very special dinner for my wife and I.  It was to celebrate our 20th anniversary.  A big deal to me.  I wanted it to be perfect.  If not perfect at least very good would have been nice.  I booked the romance package at the suggestion of the phone agent/host that was there on Sunday night, May 15th.  There was absolutely no mention that the package was going to include an \"included gratuity\" of $22.39 or of any amount for that matter.  But that is really just one of many surprises we had last night at the Ahwatukee Melting Pot.  I also think it is important to let you know that we do have a frame of reference for our visit in that we have been to the Arrowhead/Peoria, AZ several times, the Scottsdale location, the Ahwatukee location maybe 10 years ago as well as the Littleton, CO location.  I honestly don't even know what to talk about next.  I am so frustrated that my 20th anniversary dinner was just a mess.  I will try to be as succinct as possible from this point on:
1--The booth was so, so hot.  We had the curtain closed for maybe 2 minutes because the heat in that booth was unbearable.  I am trying to be conservative in my guess that the temperature in the \"corner\" of the booth (moving all the way to the closed end of the booth) was 87 degrees most of the time.  I tried to sit there for about half of the dinner and then my wife could not bear to see me so hot and we switched places.  She lasted for about 10 minutes and then we took turns getting up and walking into the rest of the restaurant to cool down.  I found respite in the men's bathroom several times where there was an A/C vent near the sinks.  When all of this was brought to the manager's attention (I sought him out--I think he was the manager but he never identified himself as such) he said the curtains closed can make it hot in there.  But since we didn't have the curtains closed, this wasn't the problem.  Finally, during dessert, my wife just gave up and left the restaurant alone to go sit in the car with the A/C running--she was so miserable!  It was not my plan to have my wife sit alone in a dark parking lot on our 20th anniversary.  Which leads me to point #2--We were there for over 3 hours.  Neither my wife nor I have ever had any dining experience take over 3 hours.  We sat down at 5:30 and our check clearly states we paid our bill at 8:34.  And the only reason we got our bill that soon is because we had not seen our waiter in about 20 minutes and I had to find someone to print our bill out.  We actually never saw him again.  He never came to apologize or anything while I was waiting for the check at the front kiosk (and my wife was sitting alone in the car).  This was not an 8 course or 12 course meal here.  3 hours seems way, way too long.  We had plans for a show after dinner, but were not able to make it--that was a frustrating disappointment since it was part of the reason we were going out that night.  We even mentioned this to our waiter and he suggested that we take out dessert \"to go\" and that we could, and I quote, \"heat up the chocolate in the microwave at home\".  This seems very unprofessional--we didn't want a to go order, we just wanted him to hurry it up.  The Melting Pot is not a \"to-go\" kind of place.  Why would I spend so much money to not actually eat at the restaurant?!?  At the time (this was over 2 hours into the dinner) he said he understood that we needed to get things moving, but then was even SLOWER with our service.   Point #3--Our waiter started off strong but progressively got slower and more forgetful.  When we were his only table at 5:30 he was doing great but then as the other booths filled up he seemed to lag way behind.  He badly needed a runner or expediter or at the very least someone to come fill up water glasses for him but none of those people ever showed their presence.  We even overheard him tell the table next to us that he made them his own version of a margarita since the bartender was busy and again I quote, \"its just a margarita...how hard can it be?!?\"  Seriously?!?  That was so unprofessional.  I am assuming our table neighbors were paying $15 for that margarita that he just decided to throw together--he is a waiter, not a bartender and shouldn't be making his own cocktails.   We got so sick of waiting for our waiter just to have him come back and say, \"oh oops, I forgot to fill your water.  I'll be right back.\" and then not see him for 20 minutes.  It was just not at all the kind of service one would expect when your bill is close to $150.  I gave all of this feedback and more to the Melting Pot website and absolutely no one has gotten in contact with me.  I even called the FL H.Q. and still no response.  So...maybe Yelp can get their attention.  Anyway...I'm hitting the review word # limit..."}
{"text":"Pricey chain restaurant experience. The food is good but not for the price's. the Melting Pot screams chain restaurant to me and I guess I'd rather find a mom / pop place. I think it's trying to hard to be something it isn't...unique."}
{"text":"With some trepidation after reading other reviews from people who used coupons, we went for dinner to Ahwatukee Melting Pot. We have been there before and were always happy with meal but wondered how coupon would change it all based on other reviews.  This time two of us were on coupon and the third decided to get 4 course.  He says \"what a great meal for $36!\"   Jennifer was our very entertaining server. She was quick on the \"merlot\" refill. Wink wink (she will know what we mean). Quick service and very fast on bringing generous refills of shrimp and tenderloin which we consumed the fastest.  All in all a great meal and loved the dessert!!  Jennifer earned her 20% gratuity."}
{"text":"For such a high-end restaurant, they sure don't treat you that way. I made a reservation online for a booth, and when I arrived, they tried to give me a table. When I explained that I had reserved a booth (and for a reason), the seating hostess actually argued with me that it was technically half of a booth. I couldn't believe she was trying to convince me to take the table - the restaurant was empty! When I insisted that we have the booth we reserved, she finally took us across the restaurant to a booth. 

While the food was very good (especially the desert), the service was not. I walked out of there feeling like I paid nearly $50 a person for the same service I could get at any chain restaurant for $20 a person.

Definitely not impressed, and I won't be going to this particular restaurant again. I'm disappointed because I remember that The Melting Pot used to be such a well-known,  high-class restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food. Jamie was the BesT! Very professional and service was outstanding. The chocolate at the end was to die for. My girls loved it... The filet was very tinder and we had a great time with family."}
{"text":"THE WORLD MUST KNOW ABOUT SHELLEY!

As a going away dinner (I'm moving back to the Northwest), a few friends and I went to The Melting Pot. It happened to also be AZ Restaurant week so the usually expensive food was more reasonable. Our first course was a cheese fondue with breads and veggies, our second course was the usual broth to cook meat in, and the third course was a dessert fondue.

To start things off, while waiting for a table, the manager manning the register noticed I was checking into Yelp and Foursquare from my phone, and she told me about the QR code they had for a free chocolate fondue for two. I quickly scanned the code, filled the little form out, and was rewarded with extra dessert. Awesome.

We met our waitress, we were told she is the best in the world. Her name is Shelley.  To start off with, we were under constant attention as we got situated, got our water, were walked through the menu and how everything works. Shelley seemed like a normal waitress as she brought out our appetizer fondue (the spinach artichoke, delicious). We were able to make small talk. She was approachable. 

Dinner progressed, and she was always there to help us out, and she would laugh with us at our dumb jokes. Pretty normal stuff.

Dessert came around, and both Shelley and the manager were at our table helping us with our dessert decision. As part of AZ Restaurant week, we got 4 dessert portions, the QR promo added another 2. They warned us that 6 portions would be far too many. Without any hesitation, they allowed us to use the QR promo as a coupon instead, which took $16 off our check. They also still allowed us to have two separate 2 serving chocolate fondues (different flavors). It is so nice when a restaurant and its employees work with their customers and don't have some sort of rulebook that they need to stick to.

Everything is great so far, but it only gets better.

Along with our first dessert fondue (the flaming turtle), she brought back a dessert for me that isn't even on the menu. We had talked about it earlier, and she made it specifically for me just because we talked about it. No extra charge. Now I know this won't happen to everyone who goes to The Melting Pot, but the fact that it happened at all speaks greatly to the restaurant. A waitress was able to make a customer a custom dessert? That's fantastic. So Shelley is already getting a huge tip.

We proceed through the flaming turtle and into the second dessert fondue, which was described as a chocolate covered pretzel. It was delicious. Now we get the bill, which we planned on splitting. After drinks, and lobster tails, and such, the bill became a little more complicated than just splitting the bill four ways. 

I was doing math on the bill when I noticed that the coupon wasn't applied so the bill was 16+tax+gratuity higher than it should have been. I told her about it, she apologized, took the bill and rung up a new and accurate one. Embarrassingly, since it seemed so ridiculous, I asked for the old bill back because it had my math on it. She left the table, and came back a few minutes later with the old bill, now wrinkled. She said, \"I'm sorry, I threw it away, but I found it in the trash!\" SHE WENT THROUGH THE TRASH FOR MY OLD BILL JUST TO SAVE MY FIRST GRADE ADDITION WORK. Who does this? Superstar waitresses only.

At this point, I'm imagining Shelley as some sort of action movie hero. When she leaves our table, she straps on the jetpack to fly to the nearby store just to pick up the ingredients she needs to make my custom dessert, and she's back in time to replace my plate that I accidentally put raw meat on. Then she is off again, wading her way through trash to look for my coveted scratch marks on a bill that truly was garbage. 

If you ever go to this place, request the action movie hero Shelley as your waitress. 

Food: 5/5
Service: 5/5"}
{"text":"I would not recommend The Melting Pot unless money is no object. I bought a Deal Chicken deal for $99 because as a single mom I thought it would be a great experience for my children but not break my bank. I was wrong. My so called \"deal\" wound up costing me $218.00!!!!! 

With my Deal Chicken I was to get one bottle of wine. The waitress told me I could either order 2 bottles of the cheaper wine or one bottle of up to a $50 value. I picked out a $48 bottle and asked her if this would be ok and she said yes. WRONG! I was charged an additional $48 for the bottle of wine which of course increased the tax and gratuity. When I asked her why I was charged for the wine when it was suppose to be included she didn't really give me a clear answer and said she had explained it the way they were told to explain it. WHAT???????

I don't normally buy alcohol when I go out due to the over inflated prices so had I known I was going to have to pay $48 out of pocket for a bottle of wine I NEVER would have bought it in the first place!

I like the restaurant but would never go back unless someone else is footing the bill and would NEVER buy another \"deal\"."}
{"text":"I frankly don't get why people like this place....with exception of desert, - fruit, cake, dipped in chocolate - ok, I get it...its good and I would go back for that and that alone.

But for dinner...way overpriced, way overrated. Not family friendly at all. There are much better options out there in terms of value and quality."}

We had the Chocolate Turtle Flambe.  Of course the kids loved the fondue forks and were amazed at the chocolate on fire!  Then all the fantastic tastes on the dessert plate, strawberries, cheesecake, marshmallows, bananas, pound cake and brownies.  They didn't stand a chance!  Jeremy brought us out extra bananas, pound cake and marshmallows.

We had a great time and will return for a full meal, or just dessert again."}

- Service is decent, though it sounds rehearsed enough to impede ambiance.
- Coffee is good.
- Dessert is good.

Cons:
- The wine list consists of $5 grocery store offerings.
- The meat is overly seasoned; coated head to toe with salt. 

Overall: We felt railroaded through an assembly line of mediocre food disguised [and sold] as upscale chain dining. This will not happen again."}

Food was good, service was attentive without being intrusive. would recommend it for those looking for a romantic, quiet semi-private dining experience."}
{"text":"The Melting Pot is a great place to eat for special occasions.  The food was really good and the dessert at the end was probably the best part of eating there.  
Now before you go you have to look at the menu (it's on their website) to see the prices and what you are getting into.  After you accept the prices sit back, relax, and have fun.  I went there with my wife for our anniversary and it was the perfect place to celebrate.  The atmosphere is very fun and different.  I would definitely anyone who is going for a special occasion to at the very least try it.  You would have a difficult time not having fun.  Anyone who is going here HAS to get the dessert.  If you miss the dessert then you missed the best part!

Tips:  Sign up for their \"Club Fondue\" on their website and you will receive a free dessert for 2 (I believe it's like $16 normally).  They also say they will send you free stuff for birthdays and anniversaries, but I haven't confirmed this.  Also the 3 and 4 course meals (for 2) are a LOT of food.  There was no way we could eat it all, so don't feel like you have to finish everything that comes out and whatever you do, save room for dessert!
In summary, great place once you get over the cost, ideal of special occasions, and get the dessert (I swear it's the last time I will say that :) )."}
{"text":"Went here for my 1 year anniversary, my father came along but sat at another table with his date. A typical meal for two is about $100. It is a nice change for doing something interactive and definitely being able to savor your food. It is definitely an occasional type restaurant for those like me who don't have money to be throwing around everyday. But the experience is definitely worth it. 
We were treated as important customers, and when an obstacle came up with our food, the waiter and manager were extremely apologetic. We were offered a new plate, and our whole bill was taken care of. (as was my family's bill who was sitting at another table)
I was impressed with the service and the way our waitress didn't look down on us but made polite conversation with us :) this place is my celebration restaraunt!"}

But for a different night out, I recommend it."}

Don't come here if you're on a budget, as most of the dinner options are fairly expensive, and make sure you don't have anywhere to be afterwards, as a full meal can take over two hours."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, really! My husband surprised me on Valentine's Day with a reservation so I was super excited. We were a few minutes late because our movie lasted longer than expected but he called them to let them know we would be about 10 minutes late and they were very accommodating, so thank you. We were actually less than 5 minutes late but we still had to wait about 15. Ok, whatever. So we went to the bar and had a drink and the bartender was super cool. 

Once we got settled we were greeted by our server. Everything is ok at this point - I'm still excited. Once we look over the menu and decide on what we want, the server comes over and grills us about upgrading the cheese cooking oil. We didn't upgrade and he kept pushing and pushing the citrus one and I'm like, no BRO - we don't want it but thanks for asking. So, he sighs and says, okaaaaaaaaay. Really? You're gonna throw a fit because I don't want your citrus upgraded cooking oil? Now, I'm a little irritated. We enjoy the cheese course and salad, which was awesome and move on to the entrée.

I was good with the basic menu and again, he kept pushing the upgraded lobster tail. My husband decided to try it - ok, fine. When the time came to tell us about how to cook everything he was super boring. I remember going to the one in Scottsdale many years back and our server was so great in explaining the different cooking times, etc...now, I don't know how exciting it really is to explain cooking the food but I remember her fun personality adding to the whole experience of being at the Melting Pot. This dude was so annoying I just wanted him away from us. Entrée was ok, tiny portions and lobster tail was small. 

Chocolate time! By now, I'm super annoyed every time he would check on us because he would say something stupid or try to get us to buy something. He kept pushing us to buy drinks. All I had was water and he kept asking if I was sure about that. I was so close to telling him yes, water is fine because I'm breastfeeding you idiot. I was trying really hard to not let this guy ruin our night but our entire conversation, I realized had been about how horrible this guy is. Damn. We got our chocolate and ate it fast because it was good :) 

Our bill came and gratuity is automatically added; fine, whatever. My husband paid cash and dude comes back with the whole do you need change? Normally, my husband would say no but this time he said hell yes. 

Overall, server was annoying, the food was ok; the cheese and chocolate saved the day, and it was horribly overpriced. For the 2 of us, we spent $272. Yes, it was V-Day but so not worth it."}
{"text":"Nothing beats chocolate fondue (especially if it's from The Melting Pot)! They have great deals for happy hour and it's a great romantic place to enjoy dessert."}
{"text":"If I have to review the food alone, I will give it a one star.  The service is prompt and courteous so I'll give it an extra one star.

Let's start from the beginning.  We had a reservation and was seated promptly.  The waiter came and greeted us, gave us the menu and everything went well.

Appetizer: We started with the Alp & Dell Cheese Fondue which is a white wine and Gruyere, Raclette and Fontina Cheese Fondue. It tasted two dimensional, exactly garlicky and salty.  The raw cauliflower and carrot which I usually love to eat tasted bitter with the cheese.

Salad: We went with California Salad which is mixed salad greens with raspberry vinaigrette dressing.  The salad came very watery, very very sweet and it was swimming in the dressing. We could not even finish it off.

Main Course: This is the worse of all the courses. We picked the pacific rim cooked in coq au vin broth.  It came with Teriyaki Marinated Sirloin, Citrus Pork Tenderloin, Shrimp, Chicken, Pot sticker, Mushroom, and Veggies.  We deliberately chose coq au vin broth even though it cost more because we read here that it's worth it. Everything tasted bland and that citrus pork and teriyaki sirloin tasted very weird, sour and salty and not in a good way at all.  The chicken and the shrimp also tasted bland.  It really tasted like boiled chicken meat that's a bit salty. Their solution?  Dip it in our sauce: Teriyaki, Sweet and Sour and Yogurt based curry sauce.  The sauces tasted like cheap sauces you can find in a bottle in any grocery stores. It has no character, no complexities,  very very disappointing.  Oh yeah, this is what our waitress said,  just cook everything about 2 minutes or so, don't worry if you don't time it correctly, it's impossible to overcook anything here, just leave it on the pot and that's fine.  This is not just the cooking instruction for  our table.  We can hear that every table get the same cooking instructions from different waiter/waitress.  The problem is not overcooking for us, but it just tasted bland.

Dessert: We chose the Smore with Dark Chocolate Fondue.  This is the best part out of this horrible feast.  It comes with Strawberry, Graham Cracker, Marshmallow, Cheesecake, Pound Cake and Rice Crispies to dip it with. First, the strawberry was fresh, marshmallow was great, graham cracker was crunchy.  Now come the bad part, the part that they had to make: The rice crispies was kinda stale, the pound cake was crumbling like a week old cake, and the cheesecake was just meh.  We suddenly realized that the part that was good, they did not have to make( ie: the strawberry, the cracker and the marshmallow).  The part that they had to make tasted bad( ie: the crispies, cheesecake, pound cake).  

We do not mind splurging on our foods on special occasion.  We realize that it takes a lot of efforts to make special dishes.  This is seriously lacking in everything, cheap basic material for the food, horrible taste, and no cooking method involve at all by the kitchen.  Why are we paying that much again?  I don't mind paying $100 for a meal if it is cooked properly and tastes great.  It's not the price at all, it's just there is no value to this meal."}
{"text":"I love fondue.  I love sitting in the private booths with curtains.  I love the idea of dining in privacy.  The Melting Pot also has a nice program called \"club fondue\" that gives you coupons for a free dessert on your birthday/anniversary.  They have seasonal selections/specialities that can be exciting to try.  
But damn if that \"I'm too cool for this job\" waiter didn't let me down on the service.  It's standard etiquette to knock before opening the curtains and then shut them when leaving.  But the waiter wasn't really interested in doing either.  And then, I promise you, when it came time for the dessert, he didn't bother to stir/mix the ingredients for the chocolate fondue.  Can you actually forget to do that??
Still, I love the fondue."}
{"text":"We went on New Years Eve for my daughters birthday. They had New Year's Eve hats and tiaras at our table. The food is surprisingly good. Portions are more than enough. We ate veggies, meat, and dessert. Our server was friendly and attentive. We got directions on what to do which was nice because we had never been before. Cosmo was good. Lighting is dim. Its a casual atmosphere. We were overcharged, but the manger reversed the charges a few days later. We all had a great time."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the service was absolutely great. I couldn't have asked for a better bartender or waitress. 

Now that being said - maybe this place isn't so bad if you're into paying an arm and a leg to cook your own food. I came here hungry so it was a bit of a pain to have to wait minutes in-between bites.

The upside to the slow eating process is the great time you get to spend with your date conversing and not rushing through a meal - that's always a great change of pace. Atmosphere was dark and relaxing and seating was very comfortable."}
{"text":"This was my first visit with large group of people.  The table next to ours had their chocolate heated and stirred with the whole \"fire scene.\"   Our table was looking forward to that happening too, but all our chocolate did was get hard so that it was impossible to dip anything into.  Our pot was never heated at all.  They had turned the table stove off before it came and left it that way.  What kind of waiter or waitress would do that?  I called the manager a day or two later and all he said was that he'd talk to the people on staff that night.  Woo hoo!  No offer to come back.  I guess they don't believe in customer satisfaction by doing whatever they could to offer us a better experience.  Nope.  I guess they want us to just write a review on here instead!  Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"In all honesty, it had been over 5 years since our last visit to this Melting Pot. That was because that experience was very forgettable and not worth repeating. We decided to give the place another chance for a group dinner. We made a reservation on Open Table and arrived ahead of our seating time.
We were then subsequently escorted to some non-descript, over sized banquet area that was oppressively hot. Everyone in our party was sweating immediately and several had diffculty breathing. We asked to be seated elsewhere, which was accommodated but by placing us next to the kitchen entrance.
The only reason that I am offering this review two stars was the service provided to our group by Mike, our server. He was the only highlight of the evening.
For a place where the average price per person borders on $50, they have no concept on how to treat their clientele.
One thing is for sure, we will NEVER be going back."}
{"text":"Such a delight!! It was inevitable that it was going to be delicious but tonight was far superior than others. Kudos to the Ahwatukee Melting Pot!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad the people who have received great service at The Melting Pot had a good time! We make our own good time wherever we go, but there is no other way to say this: our waiter was horrible. It took 27 minutes (I had my timer out for the entree anyway) to get a glass of water, which had no ice and was warm. We finally had to ask the manager for some ice during his courtesy walk-through. \"Daniel\" blamed everyone else but himself for his own shoddy work. \"Well, I have four tables ... Well, I had to carry this myself. No one wants to help me ... Well, my only helper is in training ...\" Well--well--well, but REALLY not very well at all. In fact, he should not be working at a place where people have to drop a hundred dollars or more per couple for dinner. It was atrocious and insulting to be assigned to this whiny amateur. Go get some experience before applying to work somewhere that guarantees its customers experiential dining! Expecting your customers to sacrifice their good time to accommodate your problems is highly unprofessional! The Melting Pot management completely failed when they put this guy on the floor. 

The food was about what we expected. Cheesy fondue--tasty, but really salty, and we don't understand why they have to put liquor in everything. Boiled meat--tasty enough, but again, the broth was super salty. Chocolatey yin and yang cuteness--artistically executed. The meal was adequate. Whatever. The food itself is not special. The fondue experience is fun and it's okay to spend way too much money once in a while for a unique night out, so that was all fine. We liked the food. We might even go back some time, but we would just sit at the bar and have the $20pp endless dipping blah blah, and not try to make anything romantic out of it. 

Speaking of trying to make it romantic, we went to celebrate both our birthdays. We did get a \"private\" booth...sort of. It had a curtain, which started out closed. It was just a standard 4-seater booth and we sat across from each other so we could both reach the fondue pot, so it wasn't all that romantic. I had asked for a half-moon booth when I made the reservation, but my request was not granted. It got worse as soon as the pot started steaming. It got so muggy and uncomfortable in there that we had to open the curtain. There were no customers across from us, so it still seemed secluded...until they sat a drunk woman and her friends on the other side of our \"wall\". We couldn't see each other but her loud, obnoxious cackling put a definite damper on our experience. Also, when my husband sneezed, she yelled out \"bless you!\" So obviously, any perceived privacy at The Melting Pot is only in your imagination. 

We had been referred there by someone who loves the place and has always had a good time there, has always been seated in a half-moon booth, and clearly has never had \"Daniel\" as a waiter, or been accosted by the drunken outbursts of other customers. I was told if I let them know we were both celebrating birthdays, that our desert plate would have \"Happy Birthday\" written across it in chocolate syrup. I did so, but the Lamest Waiter in the Universe did nothing to acknowledge our special occasion at all. 

As a matter of Yelp* business, The Melting Pot does indeed solicit reviews from their customers. In fact, they offer a 10% discount if you write a review during your dining experience and show it to them. However, Yelp* is \"not accessible from that location\" so we couldn't get the alleged 10% off, which I now assume was just a scam and may explain many of the positive reviews IF anyone could even access Yelp* from inside the restaurant.

I certainly hope the abysmal service we received is not typical of The Melting Pot experience, but after our hundred dollar, three-hour-long meal-ordeal was over, we were unimpressed and not in any mood to offer them another chance.

Also, I think for what you get and how long it takes, three dollar signs, while accurate, makes it seem cheaper than it is."}
{"text":"WOW!  This place is kind of expensive, but it is good food, great atmosphere and just plain fun.  We went there for my g/f's bday and we had a blast.  The sauces that they give you when you start eating your meats and veggies are sooooo good.  The drinks were not that expensive from what I could tell...I paid $5 for a beer...which is not too bad.  So if you want to go somewhere for a special occasion, then you can't go wrong here.  Just remember to figure, it'll be about $100 per couple..."}
{"text":"We ate at the melting pot in Phoenix on Saturday afternoon. The food was good. The atmosphere was enjoyable. It was very pricey though. $39.95 per person for food we had to cook ourselves. Can't imagine what the price would have been if they cooked it. Just a one time experience. I won't be going back. Too expensive."}
{"text":"We had such an awesome server named CJ. The meals are consistently good but the service is what makes the difference and this melting pot has really improved since we've been here last. New managers and new servers now make this the best one in the valley. Great experience. Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"The only part of the meal that was worth it was the dessert.  Both the creme brulee and turtle chocolate were fantastic!  
The California Salad was small.  
The Cheddar Cheese Fondue needed more of a cheese flavor so perhaps less beer.  
The Signature Selection entree was mixed - filet cuts were great but I didn't care for the chicken, pork or marinated sirloin.

If I came back, I would only order dessert."}
{"text":"I took my best-friends here cause I wanted them to have a good experience as I had gone for my birthday over 14 years before and had a great time. So my bestie #1(coworker) her wife's birthday is 11 days from mine so I decided to plan it in between our days on 12/8/17 at the Ahwatukee location. Our awesome, incredible, funny, crazy that matched our crazy server CJ (Clayton) as there are 2 CJ's there was very attentive got us a pairing of wine to try with our description but we were still unsure of a choice so he got his manager who was more experienced in that field and hit it on spot. Go Michael!! But anyways back to our waiter Clayton he was so funny I haven't laughed that much at dinner in a long time. Especially with the waiter having a great sense of humor. We are so used to being the craziest but he did not falter once, in fact I say he got me to be stunned opened mouth with his witty comebacks a couple of times. Something I am definitely not used to. So as any patron I asked him to get his manager cause we wanted to let him know he was awesome while making it seem like we had a complaint. When the manager got there I told Clayton to leave so we could talk behind his back. Which he did with a great attitude cause he knew we were being funny. So the manager Michael was also down with our crazy & started joking with us too. Saying mockingly I wish people would stop telling me how good of a waiter he is. Now I know it does not come over well in text but we laughed the whole time we were there. Will definitely go again and absolutely request Clayton as we got lucky he was our server in the first place. Great attitude, atmosphere, and great company. We had a blast! Thanks again for a wonderful Birthday!!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here and everything was FANTASTIC! The hostess was super nice, our server Brad, was so helpful, polite and professional. The food was incredible! We also appreciated the manager coming by the table and making sure everything was great! We also had the SMORES fondue.... It's like heaven in your mouth! We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for special occasions.  Most recently I went for an anniversary, and the booth with a curtain was very romantic.  We decided to just get salads, and the cheese and dessert courses because those are the best parts!  It's also plenty of food without the meat course.  

I love the experience of fondue as well as the variety of flavors.  We paired our meal with a good wine and spent an hour and a half just enjoying ourselves.  

Good atmosphere, great food, friendly service... it's not cheap, but (again, for special occasions) the value is worth it."}
{"text":"Came here the weekend before Valentine's Day with my boyfriend, expecting them to have their normal menu. We made a reservation over the phone and they did not inform us of the menu. Once we got into the restaurant, they asked us if we knew that the menu was only their love menu which was $59 a person or $75 together. As an 18 year old, I simply could not afford to spend that much without knowing before hand so we left. I love this restaurant but I just wish they would have informed us about their special menu. Maybe it was common knowledge, but I had no idea. I will most likely be back but just not before Valentine's Day again."}
{"text":"We went to the melting pot for dinner as a date night adventure, first of all I want to give major props to the staff they were amazing!! As for the food... Not so much we really enjoyed the appetizer for beginner but the main course was not very good at all all of the food they had brought to us was very bland and boring. We had the endless meats and ask for the shrimp because we enjoy the taste of the shrimp as it is so its hard to screw that up for us. But they brought us a slap in the face 4 count them 4 shrimps at a time. For about $50 a person I expected so much more. Desert was great but not worth the price. This was differently a huge bust. I would not recommend this place to anybody I like."}
{"text":"What a fun date. It was my first time having fondue but it was worth every penny. Our server was great, perfect amount of good service while letting us have our private experience.

We had the lobster tail, shrimp, duck breast, filet mignon, new york steak, and chicken breast. Was a fun mix and match were we got to try multiple cuts of meat. Ended up getting the mojo cooking style and definitely did not regret it.

Desert was phenomenal and a great way to end the meal. Would certainly recommend this dining experience."}
{"text":"**Edit: The GM made a point to reach out after this to apologize and explain that my experience was out of the ordinary and that they pride themselves on providing an exceptional time for their guests. Having worked in the industry for years, I appreciate this effort to go above and beyond to rectify the situation, and will be giving this location another shot in the future. **
 

I have always enjoyed my experiences here, but last night's fell short. I made a reservation online on Monday, and a few hours later got an email telling me it had been cancelled. When I called to figure out why, the manager explained that they were switching reservation systems, and that they still had the reservation. I made a point to confirm that we were coming in for my boyfriends birthday, and would like to sit in one of the more private booths off to the side. He said that wouldn't be a problem, and went on to explain that they take a picture to remember the evening. When we arrived, we were walked past 6 unoccupied private booths, and sat at a regular table. The service was standard, the food (as always) was excellent. We had the never-ending fondue and added the lobster. The only reason this review is even getting 2 stars is because of how delicious everything was. At no point was my boyfriends birthday even aknowledged, no manager stopped to see how the meal was going, nothing. At the end of the meal, I walked back past the 6, still unoccupied, private booths, to ask about why we were not able to be sat there, and why our special occasion had been ignored. He said they could only guarantee a private booth if you buy a package. I understand this, but with 6 open booths for 2.5 hours, I imagine it would not have been an issue for us to sit there, as promised. When he offered to take care of something on the bill, I explained that I had already paid because I did not want him to do that. I was not looking for handouts, I just wanted him to aknowledge that I could have had a more special experience at an Olive Garden or heck, even an Applebee's would have been better. Overall a disappointing experience. Will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"I took my wife to The Melting Pot earlier this evening for our anniversary dinner. Upon arrival, we were promptly greeted by the hostess and the manager, and even seated before our reservation time. Our server came out quickly, with a friendly, pleasant demeanor and a fun, quirky attitude. She was fast, courteous, informative and fun. She helped us through our first visit in detail and helped make our anniversary dinner an amazing experience. Our drink never ran empty, we never waited long for the follow-up course and no questions went unanswered. Her recommendations were solid and we had a blast. Our visit was well worth every penny! We will definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Awful ... This was a terrible experience. The meat was old looking - slimy and grey and the broth or whatever they call it that we were supposed to cook the meat in looked like dirty sea foam and tasted worse. Not to mention the fact that we were left to sit in front of this boiling pot of yuck for more than 20 minutes before I finally went to find our waitress to ask where our food was.... Anyway maybe they were having an off night but both my daughter and I were beyond disappointed. I will never go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite splurge restaurants, but this review is for their Happy Hour. 
I never think of Melting Pot for great Happy Hour deals, but I will now. 
They offer $5 cheese and chocolate fondues as well as great drink and salad specials. The atmosphere in the bar is romantic and quiet. We were the only people in the bar for our entire visit. 
The bartender was great and made adjustments to the cheese like we requested without a problem. 
I think the hh hours are 4-6pm, but don't quote me on that. 
If you are looking for a different happy hour vibe check out the Melting Pot."}
{"text":"Last time we came here, they must have had the ac off because I couldn't stop sweating.  Our server was nice enough but we could tell he was new as he was slow.  And since we were seated towards the back/ kitchen, we could hear some women servers talking about their sex life with their new partner.  It was totally unprofessional and quite disgusting.   We will not be returning."}
{"text":"love this place. great for couples and the best cheese and Chocolate !!"}
{"text":"As always great service and lots of fun its a tad expensive for fondue but its worth it especially for special occasions"}
{"text":"Overpriced and overhyped food. Last time turned around at the door due to the smell and waiting line....."}
{"text":"First timers at the Melting Pot....perhaps our last?    

We weren't too happy about hidden costs they don't let you in on.  We went there for a special Valentines dinner and we were charged $5.95 for broth to cook our food..... \"Hello.... How are we supposed to cook our meat?\"   Why should we be charged for that???   We went with 3 couples and were charged that 3 times and we only had 2 pots!    
Another \"go figure\" why when I order my meal off their special Valentines menu consisting of their serf and turf for $66.95 do I not get my own lobster?  My husband and I had to share it.  My father-in-law had his own surf and turf and had a full lobster!  He was lucky his dining partner ordered the other choice offered, the turf.
Hardly want to go into the gratuity that is included in the price!  That really bothers me when they do that..... Lucky for us she was a good waitress."}
{"text":"Well my experience wasnt too good here. First off we got in and they asked if we have reservatons which is absurd since the place was empty. Then they told us wait a few and I asked if they had a bar. I went to the bar and waited 10 minutes to order one drink. 
   30 seconds after sitting at the bar some guy from the front comes and says that our table is ready. Well I said I havent even ordered a drink yet. He said ok and walked away then came back and said we could transfer our drinks to our table. I once again said, we havent even ordered a drink. 
    After 15 minutes I told them our table was ready and walking thru the place I saw it was maybe 30% full. Why would you ask if I had reservations and then make me wait to be seated. On top of that when we came in the place they asked for my first and last name and a contact number \"in case we forgot something?\" Yeah right, told em no I dont think so.
    When we got to the table we waited over 10 minutes for our server. The prices were abhorent running $35 per person. The meal was tiny and they couldnt bring plates, napkins or more drinks when I asked. I left a 5% tip which was pathetic as was the service. 
     I can go into more detail about how bad the drinks or service was but this place is a ripoff. Not worth it avoid fondue and the melting pot. I could of bought all that food for $10 in the store. Never again."}
{"text":"Been a huge fan of the melting pot. Our recent visit makes me feel I shouldn't go back. Was celebrating my birthday, the server didn't care. Never poured our wine for us. Think too busy flirting w her tables. Really bummed my special day was ruined and we spent good money. I hate writing this but has been bugging me."}
{"text":"My fiancé took me here on one of our first dates! I had never heard of this place until then. It was definitely different from any other place I had been to! The seating was private and comfortable. The waiter was very polite and even had a quiet tone to his voice. The food itself was delicious! I enjoyed the different flavors that came with each bite! I cannot wait to return for an anniversary!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for an anniversary dessert.  We called and made reservations several days ahead of time and upon arrival there was no one in the waiting area.  However, we waited about 15 minutes before they took us to a table.

The hostess was polite but really, there was no one else in front of us or behind us.  However one couple did leave while we were waiting so I'm assuming that we received their table.  It was a Thursday night and perhaps they didn't have the entire restaurant open for seating.

We were finally seated and waited another 10 minutes before a server appeared to take our drink order.  Then another 10 minutes to order the S'mores fondue.

The fondue itself was delicious.  The dippers that came with it were delicious and high quality, however I wish that it came with bigger portions of dippers.  They seemed to be on the small side and there weren't that many.  I think that we could have done the same thing at home, spending the same amount of money, but having twice as many dippers and chocolate.  However, I know that much of it was the experience and the convenience of not having to prepare it ourselves.

I've been to the Melting Pot before with a friend and had dinner and dessert.  My husband and I and some family were here several years ago with family to celebrate our engagement with dessert fondue.  For both of those times, I remember the portion sizes being larger than they were for this review.

Overall, I give it 3 stars. Based on the service 2 stars. Based on the food, 4 stars."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? How does this place even get any stars? Maybe it was just my experience, but I will not be going back, ever. We arrived at 8:30, and left at 11:30. 3 hours! And we had our dessert wrapped into a doggy bag to go. The waitress Felicia was friendly, but is a terrible waitress. It was 10:39 by the time she brought our entrees out (the place is closed at this point), and instead of giving us our food right away, she continues to talk! I've no idea how uncooked food takes so long to come out of the kitchen, and I have no idea why it takes so long for a waitress to take our orders and bring is our food so we can eat! The worst part was getting the ridiculous bill, over $200 for such an awful experience, and I'm not even full!
Also, how the hell does a fondue place run out of cheese?! Explain that to me please."}
{"text":"Came here with my grandma and the customer service was amazing and the food was surpurb. Very friendly people and very helpful."}
{"text":"My husband and the in-laws went here last night as a part of Arizona Restaurant Week. None of us had ever been and we wanted to give it a try. 
The concept is fun and so good for groups. 
This location is ok, next time we'll have to try the Scotsdale one. However, not sure if we really will go again. 
The service was excellent, our server was attentive and nice. 
The food was good, however I can't help but feel there just wasn't an adequate amount for 4 people. Looking across the aisle at another table with just 2 people it seemed we had almost the same amount. For the price I would have liked to see larger portions, especially considering we didn't even pay the normal amount!
The chocolate fondue was my favorite. The brownie dipped in chocolate was to die for. 
Overall we had a good time. This is more a spot for the experience than the food."}
{"text":"What a great experience. Jen was a fantastic server who took the time to explain everything to us and the pace of service was great, we enjoyed every phase of the evening and left stuffed and satisfied. Great place for couples date night or out with friends"}
{"text":"Ok... so to begin with - we go to the Melting Pot once a year (most likely on our anniversary) so we have a very good idea of what to expect. Every year we have gone to other locations we had an amazing time with everyone very attentive to our needs and the level of service that made spending $100-120 on a dinner for 2 seem reasonable.

This year was our 5th anniversary and even though MP was not quite in the budget - we found a coupon and decided we should have a nice dinner anyways.  This was our first time at this location.  And seriously - I've had better service at Wendy's.  We mentioned to them that it was our 5th anniversary and the hostess didn't seem to care.  Not one person wished us a happy anniversary.  And not one person (except for maybe our waitress) was even half-way nice or welcoming.

I don't know if that's because we had a coupon or not - but our portions were literally 2/3 (if not only half) of what original 3 course dinner is.  We felt as if we were totally robbed because after still spending $80 for a dinner for two & bad service - we were still hungry and considering going to Cheesecake Factory (which is way better by the way).

Once again - this is NOT a review of the Melting Pot in general as a chain - I love a concept, I love the food - but please DO NOT COME TO THIS LOCATION... worst ever."}
{"text":"This is mine and my wife's favorite place to come for a romantic dinner. We've eaten here maybe once a year and always have had a great experience. This time they went above and beyond great. We are on low-carb diet and had asked if they had 85% dark chocolate for our dessert. The manager came and informed us they did not, but he actually drove to the grocery store and bought it for our meal, no extra charge, despite our insistence that it was not necessary.  they also provided an iPad for us with the calorie and carbohydrate content of each of their menu items and customized our meal. THAT is going the extra mile. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Nope nope nope nope. I've visited 20+ melting pots across the US and never, ever, EVER had an experience like tonight. 

Blown away by the sheer unprofessionalism of manager Victor Felix. He gave us attitude from the get go when we asked for a two burner top instead of a one. The hostess girl was literally petrified of him because \"he was having a rough night.\"

Our server was back, just for Christmas and his game was rusty to say the least. Ordered the endless promotion for St Jude's and confirmed with our server we could swap steak for potstickers and was told no problem (potstickers are way cheaper than steak, so it was a no brainer for them...).

We had two pots of cheese. One was ok, the other was horrible. It tasted like bottom shelf wine. Server was more than happy to replace. Disappeared with the bad cheese for 15 minutes while we all had empty drinks. 

Victor came out and informed us that he could not and would not serve endless potstickers. I asked a few questions, trying to figure out why and all his answers were short. I even tried to explain to him that all our orders contained filet mignon and that the pot stickers were way cheaper than that- and he just wasn't having it.

We asked him to make an exception, since we had already ordered and were told it was fine and he straight up said no. He literally did not care.

We left. Literally said, \"ok then we will go have dinner somewhere else\" and he didn't care at all."}
{"text":"We tried the melting pot for the first time last night for my Birthday. We had some decently high expectations and after reading several reviews had high hopes. The radiant itself smelled a little off upon entering...like it was old and someone had been trying to clean away the mildew and mold...once seated we already knew what we wanted as we had reviewed the menu the night before. We figured we would do the four course meal. And to save money we would share. It was plenty of food. The taste was not bad it want anything truly to rave about, but the experience was fun. I don't feel the cost of everything was worth it.Even sharing most everything except the salad which we ordered extra the bill was quite high...I don't think the fondu experiences was enough to have paid as much as we did.Probably won't go back as I said before nothing was really that tasty...except the salad seasoning (garlic and wine seasoning) which we got to take home as we had a Yelp check in bonus. But I think if we ever do fondu again maybe a home kit would be sufficient."}
{"text":"Wayyy over priced for the amount of food you get, but if you split it between two people it isn't that bad of a deal. Pretty cool experience just eating there. Not your everyday restaurant but if the service we got would of been better they would of earned that 5th star, I'll go again for a rare occasion"}
{"text":"I have never been to a restaurant that I could not find something nice to say until we ate at the Melting Pot. First, we were greeted by a hostess who was coughing with her mouth uncovered and sniffling when we walked in to an empty restaurant. She asked if we had a reservation and we said no. She acted as though seating us was going to be a problem while rapidly tapping her fingers over her mouth and nose. Did I mention she was visibly sick? She said nothing and ran off into another area of the restaurant. When she returned she said she needed our full name and phone number, \"In case there is a problem with your credit card.\" What?! 

After a few minutes we were seated, she offered us drinks, told us about the menu, and let us know our server \"Jeremy\" would be right over. We waited for Jeremy for approximately 10-15 minutes. 

We were ready to order all of our items but he walked away after we ordered our cheese. We ordered the alpine cheese fondu, it was awful. Raw garlic and uncooked wine left an awful after taste; it was nearly inedible. Jeremy never came back to see how we liked the cheese but showed up long after we had finished. 

We ordered our salads, asked for more water and tea, and Jeremy was off again. About ten minutes later, a busser came by to fill our drinks. Our salads were soaking in dressing, which made them really soggy and overpowering.   

We finished our salads without seeing Jeremy. Waited another 15 minutes till we saw Jeremy again after he greeted a new table next to us. We ordered our chocolate and asked for the check at the same time. The chocolate was good but the bananas were hard, crunchy and very unripe. 

We will not be back, as there are many local, upscale restaurants that supply quality ingredients, flavors, and service. This place seems antiquated and out of touch, maybe that's why the place was dead."}

{"text":"Me and my bf went here for dinner last night to celebrate our 2nd year anniversary. We got the cheddar cheese fondue (must try), shared a teriyaki glazed sirloin entree which you cook yourself in a pot full of boiling whatever you chose as a cooking style (we got the free one which was a vegetable broth), and a pure milk chocolate fondue. While she gave us our menus, she asked us what we are celebrating, which was our anniversary. For the chocolate, she gave us a happy anniversary fondue dipper plate which had two of each dippers for us to share, standard marshmallows, pound cake, bananas, strawberries, pineapple, brownies/blondies, and rice krispies. They were all yummy, actually the whole dinner was yummy. Quite pricy, but it was a special occasion. Ive read reviews that said the portions were tiny, but ours wasnt, and we left feeling satisfied. Great service and great food."}
{"text":"Last night was the first time I have ever been to the melting pot. It was a surprise from my boyfriend as we were celebrating our two year anniversary. He had everything already ordered for us with a bottle of wine. Once we were settled in our booth they brought our wine and our lovely waitress brought our wine and I had noticed something in the corner of my eye and a huge cockroach came crawling from under the picture on the wall. Naturally I wanted to scream but I just got up and told the bartender he came and killed it and said he would get the manager. The manager came he was a really nice guy and said sorry and asked how the food was. He just acted like it wasn't a big deal which I mean for a place like that it kinda is when your paying close too 200 bucks for a dinner... We said it was fine and didn't make a big deal about it. As I'm sure some people would try to get the meal for free or something since that place is really expensive. But I will say the whole rest of the night I was pretty grossed out. The manager came back around 30 mins later and gave us 25 bucks off which is really cool. But for how much my boyfriend paid for the four course meal and bottle of wine and how nice the place is. We just felt like yeah it was nice of him to do and we really appreciated it but thought he could have done a little more since we didn't make a big fuss. But oh well. The food was pretty good. And we still got to celebrate our Anniversary together so that's all that mattered."}
{"text":"We had a great time for our anniversary! The fondue was amazing. We went with the endless fondue, and that was a great choice! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Always have excellent experiences here, my wife and I have visited on multiple occasions ordering different combinations but enjoying every visit with amazing service every time we go"}
{"text":"I... just can't get over the price of the food when *I* am the cook.

MP is decent but I'm not super thrilled with it. The first couple times I went (years ago) I got a private booth with a curtain. This last time I just got a table. The ambiance was well, shit compared to the booth. You literally sit there and watch the other tables flail around in trying to cook their food. At least with a booth it is kind of romantic.

The hostest was a robot. When she spoke she was void of emotion. She sounded like she was just playing back a recording. It was super awkward, but whatever.

The four courses - salad, bread/veg, meats, and dessert - are all distinct. Here is the order of greatness - dessert, bread/veg, salad, meats. Honestly for the most expensive part, it is the least worth the money. I tried both the vegetable platter and the all land platter. Imho, veg platter isn't worth it. Meat is partially worth it. I just felt like whatever seasoning there was on the meat...I just washed it off in the broth.

Let me say this - if your dinner sucks, at least get dessert. It is by far the best. Enough that I'd come here JUST for dessert.

But again, for the price, this isn't my kind of place."}
{"text":"Pure Bliss - I haven't had a quality meal experience like this in a very very long time.  

The full 4 course dinner was stupendous and well worth every cent. 

You MUST try the Yin & Yang Martini!  It was  a very creative and well presented drink  that had me all smiles.  


I had the Smores & Chocolate desert and it was hands down my favorite (I've tried at least 5 others)."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere and amazing customer service. Everyone was extremely kind. Our server Jeremy was exceedingly patient and kind to our party - answering everyone's questions and overall being amazing!"}
{"text":"Great meal great service. Wife and I came here tonight for our anniversary and had a great experience. Even the music was perfect."}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday desserts only for fun too! We got chocolate covered strawberries and the original chocolate fondue with peanut butter and plates of sides which included brownies strawberries rice crispy treats, other fruits, creampuffs, raspberries, apple and other delicious sides. They were super nice here our server LaVonté was super spectacular and went out of his way to accommodate one of us who had  a dairy allergy. The manager even came and checked up on us. This is one of my better birthday experiences. They also mentioned that if you do have a dairy allergy to let them know ahead of time when you make a reservation so that they can accommodate you with nondairy chocolate and other non-dairy items or you can bring your own chocolate. Loved it! Will definitely be back for the delicious drinks! The service really made it special."}
{"text":"We have gone to this location several times  and love Melting Pot. We even had our wedding reception in a FL location's private room. Great service and food and it is an experience unlike a typical restaurant. We tend to reserve this restaurant for special occasions, as it is pretty pricey for the meal we like (the 4 course with cheese fondue, salad, meats, and chocolate). They always have a seasonal menu available as well and you can pick and choose from their many options for each course. 

We love the option of the private booths, too, which are sectioned off and have a curtain. We went for our anniversary last night and it was romantic and we could smooch without looking like weirdos. :-) 

We are disappointed that they changed the menu and offerings for the courses to include a few less items. For example, the chocolate course used to include a slice of cheesecake, which was the best part, but now that is a premium add-on item and costs additional. 

A few other tips: 
1. Sit at the bar for dip and sip, sampling small portions of the fondues if you want to just try some out first.
2. Go during restaurant week for a cheaper menu that includes all course but chocolate.
3.We don't even get the chocolate course anymore but if you do, ask for a non-menu combo called \"snickers\" with half dark/half milk, nuts, pb, and caramel. Yum! 
4. Ask for more dippers if you have more cheese, broth or chocolate left and space in your stomach. 
5. Go with people you like a lot because you will be with them for a long time while you fondue-it-up!"}
{"text":"This used to be a place to celebrate, now just very pricey casual.  The green chili cheese fell flat.  The salads have gotten smaller and over dressed. The entree was fine.  The chocolate was very thin and too basic on the dippers. The staff and manager all wear jeans taking away from the place it used to be.  Our waitress was bringing each course halfway through the currnet one.  Too fast.  A $200 meal should be at a pace to enjoy, not treated like Chili's.  Just too bad, really fun place has become average, nothing special."}
{"text":"I travel all over the country and the service I got from CJ was the best I have had.  Even compared to the very high end restaurants.  He was so friendly  and went well beyond the extra mile to make the experience wonderful. 

The food was wonderful- but it is really rare to get such amazing service."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to a Melting Pot restaurant (the first was in Scottsdale, AZ), and this experience was just as wonderful as the first.

I love the idea of this restaurant - it's definitely not just a meal, it's a dining experience.  It's my favorite place to go for \"date night\".  It gives me a good excuse to get dressed up!  Here are a few tips: first of all, you should make reservations in advance, and be sure to request one of the private booths.  They have a little curtain that closes and makes your table really intimate and romantic!  Secondly, do not eat much for lunch - the meals are very filling!  Third, you need to plan on AT LEAST two hours for your meal.  There are usually four courses, and each one takes a while to prepare and eat.  

The food is always delicious - each course comes with a wide variety of \"dippers\", and you get a choice of the types of cheese, chocolate, etc. so that every time you go, it can be a new experience.  I also highly recommend the drinks - the \"Yin/Yang Chocolate Martini\" is to die for!  

This is by far my favorite romantic restaurant.  The only problem is that it is pretty expensive.  Luckily, last week was Arizona Restaurant Week, so the meals were only $30 per person!  (Still pretty expensive, but we went for our 2 year anniversary, so we splurged a bit.)  I would like to look into their Happy Hour specials sometime, since I've heard good things about them. 

Overall, if you're looking for a relaxing, romantic, unique dining experience, you can't beat The Melting Pot!"}
{"text":"The melting pot did a great job helping me celebrate my birthday. I couldn't ask for a better experience! The waitress was so sweet and threw in a few freebies for me and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"We took our daughter, son and grandson to dinner for our daughters 25th birthday this Saturday. Our service was awesome! The meal was spectacular! We all had the special 4 course meal which included the cheese fondue, salad and endless entree of meats and veggies. For dessert we chose to create our own..dark chocolate and baileys. A must try if you like dark chocolate.  Dinner at the Melting Pot was a very fun and delicious birthday dinner for our family."}
{"text":"This restaurant is okay. The food is good, but not fabulous. And it's very expensive for only a so-so dining experience. I went there once, that was enough."}
{"text":"Great place for a date or small group but the food and service is a bit overrated! Its also pricey for what you get. I think I paid about $120 for a table of 3 the last time there."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. My girlfriend and I were searching for something new, and unique and stumbled upon The Melting Pot last night. Now, to be fair, we have never had fondue. I've heard stories of how much fun it is, and that it is an experience that everyone should try. 

It was on a Sunday night, and we expected it to be slow (which it was). When we first walked in the hostess was very nice and polite. I don't understand why they decided to take down our phone number, but I just gave them a fake one.There were maybe 4-5 other tables of people, and they seated us in the far back of the restaurant, which is pretty disrespectful in my opinion. The hostess explained how the menu worked, and took our drink order.

After about 10 minutes of sitting there, we still had no drinks. Finally, our server came up and asked us what we wanted to drink. She was polite and kind as well. She went more in depth, and suggested that we order the 4 course meals. After another 5-10 minutes we finally had a glass of water and our drinks (yes, we were sitting there for about 15-20 minutes without even water).

As we are sitting there, sipping our drinks, and having already decided what we were going to eat, we had to wait for the server to come back and take our order. This was about another 10 minutes from the last time we saw her (the manager dropped off our drinks). As I am sitting there, I unroll the silverware and notice a large amount of rust on the prongs, and food on the fork. I tell the server about it, and she politely takes them and our order, and says she'll bring me a new set.

5-10 minutes later, she arrives with our first cheese choice, and makes the cheese dish. She walks away without giving me any utensils. I get up, walk across to the empty table across from us, and grab a set. A few minutes later she comes back and finally drops off a set (not sure why she didn't do the same thing I did when she took the dirty, rusted ones).

My date and I find the 2 different cheese choices disgusting and bland. No real flavor.

By the time we are finished with the first cheese, we are done with our drinks. The server comes over, grabs the pan, and cleans up the salad plates. She never asks us if we wanted more drinks, even though our glasses were bone dry. Since we only see her once every 10-15 minutes, I get up and go to the bar (not all that big of a deal, but still annoying) and order the drinks. Luckily, the manager was behind the bar, and asked me why I was ordering at the bar and not through the server. He said he would bring the drinks right out to us. He brought them out to us, and told us that they were going to be on the house (Awesome!).

So, we're onto the entrees. We ordered the Cajun spiced oil, and 2 different meat types (I had the steak, duck, chicken, and shrimp. The waitress told us the cooking times, but didn't give us any sort of timer. We had our cellphones out, and timed the food. Now, the portions were tiny. I literally had 3 bites of steak, 3 shrimp, 3 small (tiny) bites of duck, and 2 chicken wrapped things. Honestly, each item was about the size of an average bite. The oil that was used made the meat taste like garbage. It was absolutely terrible. Would have been better if we would have cooked all the meat in the bland cheese. They really need to figure out different spices that have some good cajun flavoring. The only somewhat saving grace of the meat, were the side sauces. They give the meat some decent flavor. Duck, and steak should never need any sort of sauce, but this stuff was mandatory. 

The only saving portion of the meal was dessert. If you want an amazing dessert, go here. That is the only reason why I am giving it 2 stars. We had the yin and yang. White chocolate, and dark chocolate in the same pan. The fruit, and the treats you get are amazing in the chocolate. Honestly, GO THERE AND TRY IT. Don't eat or drink anything else. Pop in, eat it after a good meal somewhere else. You will not be mad.

Finally, the check. This place is outrageous. First off, she tried to charge us for our beers that the manager told us were going to be free. After telling her, she took off the charge. Still annoying. The total price was $86 dollars. This is for 2 meals, and 2 beers total. I have no problem spending $40-60/ plate for amazing food. This was not worth anywhere close to that. If the price was around 10-15/ person, it would have been more acceptable. You literally get 2-3 pieces of each type of meat. They must cut up an average sized steak, and give it to at least 5-8 people.

Final thoughts: If you hear anyone talking highly of this place, it is because they want to pretend to be classy and uppity. The restaurant caters to a higher end clientele, the type that they think they are better then everyone else. The only reason this place is still open is the desert. By the time they finish the dessert, they have forgotten the terribly, bland, overpriced meal, it is that good."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband on date night. I was very surprised. The fondu was very good! Prices aren't cheap so be ready but well worth it."}
{"text":"Not impressed by the poor customer service and length in time it took for our food to come. There was also no mention of a compulsive 20% gratuity charge we were slapped with at the end of our \"experience.\" The cheese was OK, but not anything to rave about. The chocolate peanut butter fondue was the best out of the entire meal. We each got the full course, and werent impressed with the unseasoned meats you have to cook yourself. All in all, not worth the price. Our tab came to just under $200 for 2 people with drinks, apps, entrees and dessert. No thanks."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I was so mistaken about how great a restaurant was, when the premise is you boil the main course of meat to eat it. Mmmmm, delicious boiled meat has been said by no one, ever. 

We used to love the Melting Pot in NC before moving here. Going to this restaurant was an event and you knew you would be dropping some serious $$$ to eat there.  When I saw the Living Social deal for $45 for $75 it seemed like a no brainer and a fun evening out. Boy was I wrong. 

To me, $45 for $75 says they are going to give me a $75 credit for the tab of whatever I order. For a tab that can be close to $200, this seemed like a deal so I bought it. I was surprised when we arrived and was given a \"Prefixed Living Social\" menu instead of a credit on whatever we would like. This, I also noticed, came with smaller portion sizes than what the regular menu came with. So they limit what I can order, but expect me to tip on whatever the full amount would have been without a credit?  We upgraded some of our choices knowing it would be more expensive, but it still didn't make for an enjoyable evening.

The locations in NC are set up so no booth is right across from another booth, they are kind of staggered for privacy, here felt like we were eating at TGI Fridays. The couple that was set directly across from us had requested a more private table that could not be accommodated and they made a scene. Uncomfortable, to say the least and not the date night I had in mind.

You better be a fan of garlic to eat here, because aside from the dessert, it's in every choice of every course and something about a plate of raw meat and seafood being set down in front of you, with instructions of how long to let it \"cook\" as in- if it walks boil two minutes, if it swims boil a minute and  1/2, is less than appetizing. 

Our total bill came to $180 (before the $75 credit or tip) and we left disappointed, vowing to never return. Our Living Social Deal also listed we would be given a complimentary champagne toast, which we were not even offered.  I get that we purchased a \"coupon\" but shouldn't be limited to a certain menu or treated any differently from other patrons in the restaurant.  

This place was not worth the 3 hours we spent there, \"deal\" or not."}
{"text":"The hubby took me here for a date night. The ambiance is great, and it is fun to watch your food cook and coordinate the various meal options with your date. That being said the food is just okay for me. My husband always says it is about the experience and I would tend to agree with him. 

Next time I think we will just experience the s'mores fondue and skip the rest. Much easier on the pocketbook that way. 

I do recommend joining Club Fondue as about three times a year we get free chocolate fondue for two which is probably the best part."}
{"text":"Came here with my sister and brother in law for New Year's Eve. What a wonderful decision. We had 7pm reservations and it was nice to arrive and be seated immediately. The place was busy, but very well organized. The food is good, but I have to say it's the overall experience that earns the five stars. Tonight, that experience was facilitated by a very delightful server by the name of Lisa. We had the French onion cheese fondue for starters, I had a Caesar salad. The pine nuts are wonderful, I think they were candied, which added a great sweet and savory component. We went with the coque vin (sp?). It is really a great broth for the entree. We did the cuts and added a couple lobster tails. All wonderful. Then dessert. Oh my yum. We went with the snicker doodle which was chocolate, peanuts, butterscotch schnapps, and baileys. Wow. As if we weren't already full. It was like we were addicts and couldn't stop. Until we realized if we kept going it wasn't going to be pretty. The meal included champagne toast and they gave us each a swag bag which included their wonderful wine salt and a voucher for $25! They also took our picture and we each got a framed copy as a momento. I was very impressed. Usually I like to go all out for New Year's Eve and go out and hit up a party scene. This year I wanted something low key with family and The Melting Pot gave 2012 the perfect send off. I want to give a special thanks to Lisa for being so tremendously awesome. PS - I joined yelp just so I can review this place!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, showed up on Friday night 2 days after Valentine's Day and basically we were turned away from an empty restaurant because we wanted to do happy hour and they were doing a Valentine's menu. And all we wanted was some appetizers and a drink. The worst part was the attitude of the maitre d and makes me question if I ever want to go back there again. I mean if they have a totally empty bar and they can't make cheese fondue and make a couple of drinks that's very sad but we found happiness Bottega Italian restaurant just next door! From Chef Jill"}
{"text":"We spent our ninth anniversary here! The food was delicious! We each had the four course meal with endless meat. We added our own desserts with the curtains closed...lol. Very fun!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to a Melting Pot and loved it! The atmosphere was very warm and quiet. The food was excellent and served in a timely manner. We will be going back soon!!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time! Plan for a slow, relaxing meal. It is on the pricey side as others have said but you are paying for the experience, not just the food."}
{"text":"Took the wife here for date night, love the food here!! service is world class. can't say a bad thing about this place, except I wish they had one closer to our neck of the woods.....Gilbert that is!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Our server, CJ, is the best.  Our group was a bit goofy and CJ was such a good sport.  The entire staff is friendly and helpful and the food is amazing!  Such a great experience!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  Server was friendly, but we had a difficult time understanding his accent.  Normally OK, but unfortunate here since there is more waiter-interaction than normal.

The décor in this place was a bit dilapidated.  When we arrived, we weren't sure if we were at the right door because there was no sign, and the main entrance looked like the paint was fading (so we thought it might have been a service entrance).  Inside, there were dark booths with the wood stain on the walls coming off probably from the steam that the fondue pots produce.  The black napkins had some white lint on them.  

The waiter recommended a \"garlic and wine\" seasoning be sprinkled on the wedge salad.  It was in a large plastic style spice bottle like you would find at the grocery store.  Not classy at all, and it didn't taste very good either (luckily I just sprinkled a little into my hand and onto a small part of the salad because it came out pretty fast).

For the price ($170 after tip and 2-3 drinks each) we expected better service and a more pristine environment."}
{"text":"Classic melting pot. Meat was alright, veggies were alright, everything was pretty adequate. About to try dessert though, so let's hope for the best! Hostess was kinda weird too..."}
{"text":"We celebrated our engagement at The Melting Pot and the food, as always, was amazing.

We started out with the spinach artichoke dip and I have to say, I could have passed on everything else and just had the cheese. We also had the California salad, my favorite, and the house salad. The house salad was okay, but the California was delicious. 

For the entries, we had the Pacific Rim and the French Quarter with the Mojo broth. Both were absolutely delicious and surpassed our expectations. 

For dessert we got the smores chocolate and actually agreed to \"enhance our dippers\" for an additional $5.95 and I wish we wouldn't have. It wasn't worth it and the red velvet cheesecake wasn't any good. 

All in all it was a delicious dinner. Only thing I would change is how many times they stop by your table to take your picture. We felt like they were knocking every time we put a bite in our mouths and no one likes to talk with their mouth full. We will definitely be returning though."}
{"text":"I know we all have different tastes, likes, and dislikes.  That being said, this restaurant was a very big disappoint to us.  The idea is fun and a great way to spend the evening with someone you like.  We enjoyed the cheese fondue with the bread.  For some reason, we did not find the main course to be of any \"palatal\" interest to us.  Chocolate fondue for dessert was very nice.  We ordered mixed drinks that were WAY too sweet and didn't seem to have much alcohol.  Ambiance is nice, but overall we found the food to be quite \"blah\"....especially for the price.  Sad to say, I just cannot recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I like this location better than the one in Scottsdale, I think the staff is way friendlier. 

I don't really think it's worth eating actual dinner here, in my eyes it's only good for cheese and chocolate courses. 

BUT do be sure to sign up for their mailing list, I have gotten some AWESOME deals."}
{"text":"The pros: the ambiance, the food, and the uniqueness of it all.

The setting is very relaxing and romantic. We had never had fondue before, and found it very entertaining. Our waiter was attentive without being over bearing.

The cons: the price and it can get pretty busy.

I don't remember our exact total, but I do remember thinking \"holy crap\" when they brought the check. Also make sure to plan ahead. Show up without reservations and you'll end up waiting a while.

Overall the experience was pleasant."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! This was my first visit and it was amazing. Will probably try a private booth next time."}
{"text":"Fall in love with fondue at the Melting Pot! The cheese fondue and the dessert fondue are my favorites, but the entrees aren't shabby either! Come hungry and expect to stay several hours. The only reason I gave 4/5 stars is for the price. We are teachers and about go broke dining here, but once in awhile we need to give ourselves a treat and splurge! Atmosphere is great for special occasions.  
Cheese fondue favorite = Swiss
Dessert fondue favorite = yin/yang (while & dark chocolate)"}
{"text":"Had a great time celebrating our daughters birthday.  Megan our waitress was awesome!!!Food was excellent. ...cooked to perfect by us...lol."}

{"text":"This place is amazing, not too mention Delicious!  We enjoy the 4 Course Meals with some friends and dip, ate, laugh, dip tell we couldn't eat another thing.  Highly recommend especially for a celebration of any kind."}
{"text":"Loved this date, the food was pretty much what I anticipated as a fondue fan. I was floored however by their extensive dessert menu, where the flaming turtle using dark chocolate was the highlight of the meal. It will be in the potential date night rotation in the future."}
{"text":"The service was friendly and the food was delicious. It's fun to take an evening for a relaxed dinner. This is not a place to go if you're in a hurry, it's served in courses, from delicious cheese to quality cuts of meet and fresh veggies to a delectable dessert of fruits dipped in the chocolate of your choice. Our server was excellent as well. This is our go to place for special occasions. We always leave stuffed!"}
{"text":"What a GREAT experience! 

Jeremy was absolutely WONDERFUl! He offered suggestions for making our meal the most tasteful possible! 

I would recommend this location to ANYONE! Everyone is very nice and personable! You can't go wrong for a date night here!"}
{"text":"We went here for our 1st wedding anniversary and we were not too impressed  .... they are very expensive for mediocre food. While it's a neat idea to cook your food in the fondue pot at your table the food was very mediocre.... at best. We waited at the host stand for 7 minutes before we even saw 1 person working and the service is very slow. They also sat everyone in the same section which yes might be easier for them but most people are going for a special occasion and want a little privacy. If you insist on going I would say only go for dessert."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday as a surprise date night with my fiancé, and the food was VERY good. The cheese was great, salad was fresh, dinner was amazing and dessert was over-the-top amazing. However, our waiter was beyond sub-par. I was incredibly disappointed in the service. Our waiter seemed super bothered since it was our first time and he had to explain the process to us. He was rushing us. I was literally chewing on something with my fork in my hand and he puts his hand on my salad plate and asks, \"Are you done with this?\". Well, now that your hand is on it I suppose I am. Then, we asked how do we cook things? And, he gave us a 10 word response. We had to learn our whole process from the server next door who was phenomenal. I was so, so upset about the service. And, to top it all off, we bought a $50 bottle of wine and the server broke the cork which fell into the wine, he still served it in our glasses and said, \"looks fine to me\". I requested him to send it back so he rolled his eyes at me and then had someone else in the back funneled it. Management really need to evaluate this server."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate at the Melting Pot for the first time on Christmas Eve and I loved it! We chose the 4 course meal: cheese fondue, salad, entree, and chocolate fondue. First you decide on a cheese fondue, we did cheddar, and dip items such as bread, veggies, and apples. Next is a small salad, the bacon apple salad was tasty. Then you chose proteins for your entree and a sauce to cook them in, they come raw and you cook them yourself in the sauce, very fun and interactive. The steak is absolutely delicious. Next was my favorite part, dessert. You pick a chocolate fondue, we chose amores and it comes with angel food cake, brownies, blondies, marshmallows, strawberries, bananas, and pineapples for dipping. The meal did take a few hours but I enjoyed myself the whole time. It is pricey, but definitely worth it. Our server was very friendly as well, I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went here the other night. There were 4 of us. One has Celiac Disease so we needed 2 pots., so one would be gluten free. They were completely uninterested in accommodating us in anyway. I seriously have never seen 4 people who work at a restaurant stand  around so helplessly and so less interested in seating guests at an empty restaurant. It was ridiculous. Their loss. We went elsewhere with our money and had a lovely evening."}
{"text":"Not the biggest fan of sharing a pot in between a big group of people and having to cook it ourselves. It was a bit confusing yes I should of researched more about it before going but it was for a friends birthday but I would not go myself. I would recommend looking up the experience but paying 70 dollars for one plate and beer having it to cook it yourself sharing a pot in between like four of our friends was not the best concept. Food was okay definitely not worth the price and left still hungry. The experience maybe good for some people but not my personal preference be ready to pay!"}
{"text":"My friend and i went here tonight to celebrate my birthday and were very happy with the service, the delicious food, and the scrumptious chocolate covered strawberries they gave me for my birthday. Our waiter Tyler was awesome! He was very nice and helpful and we were extremely pleased with the help we received."}
{"text":"We go to this Melting Pot for our anniversary every year. It never really disappoints. The food is always great. The price is steep but when you go once a year, it's fine. I really do encourage the 4 course as that's where you'll get your value."}
{"text":"We came in Saturday with a Deal Chicken voucher. The service was AMAZING! We had a private booth behind a curtain and despite having to move tables because our burner was broken, we couldn't have asked for better service. 

The spinach and artichoke fondue was wonderful, the salads were good but the entrée was Meh, as soon as it came I dropped a couple potatoes to get them going, by the time we were done eating the potatoes still weren't done which is a huge disappointment. I wish they would partially cook them first. 

The ravioli was wonderful. 


We didn't get desert because we were too full. Next time."}
{"text":"We love fondue! Victor was a fantastic server, friendly, explanatory and fun! We had the \"endless\" fondue. The spinach artichoke cheese starter was so yummy! Creamy and slightly spicy. The entree was endless protein and we used the MOJO style to cook the proteins. The shrimp was so delicious! Finished it off with the plain milk chocolate fondue for dessert. Hands down yummy! Great food and superb service! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Turtle chocolate and lobster tail for entree is the best. Attentive and friendly waiters"}
{"text":"This place has something for everyone I think. The four course meal is the most affordable way to go from what I've calculated unless you are only coming in for one or maybe two courses. When you do the 4 course the first is a choice of cheese fondue, then a salad, then your choice of proteins which arrive raw and you cook them in a pot of a broth of your choice, and lastly you pick your dessert chocolate fondue. The meal can take up to a couple hours so be prepared with some time. I enjoy coming but the price often prevents me from coming as much as I'd like. If you follow their emails, their promotions are helpful in bringing the price down a little bit."}
{"text":"This is my fourth trip here with my fiancee and this place gets more delicious every time. The new premium meat dippers are fantastic. Our server Bethany was great and very helpful regarding new menu changes. We had the spinach artichoke cheese and it made our month. We get a different cheese every time and they never disappoint. 5 stars"}
{"text":"Not impressed. We had never been to the Melting Pot and decided to try it for our 20th anniversary. My husband called to ask a few questions and make a reservation. The day of the reservation we called to change the time. We changed our reservation from 5:45 to 4. No issues there. When my husband made the original reservation he booked the private booth and the 4 course dinner for 2. 
We arrived at 4 when they opened. The place was extremely dead because it was so early. We paid extra for the private booth and after arriving realized that was a waste of money and totally unnecessary. The extra money paid included rose pedals on the table and a picture in a plastic frame. The booth we were placed in was intended for 2 people. OMG it was so small and cramped. The table was so small that everything was touching and crowded as it arrived to the table. Not enough room. If you are claustrophobic you will not be able to be in this booth. Because it it a table for 2 you only get 1 fondue pot. This means that even though you are paying for 2 different meals both people have to agree on the same cheese and chocolate. Not a huge deal but worth mentioning. 
1st course was the cheese. We got the fiesta cheese. It was good but for sure did not WOW us. Especially considering the price. 
The salads arrived next. Good but very small. 
The 3rd course came.... RAW meat. Now I take responsibility for not researching this better and just assuming. I thought the meats would be cooked and there would be fondue to dip the meat in. Not the case. They fill the fondue pot with broth for you to boil the raw meat in. The seasoned Court Bouillon is the standard and is at no extra cost. The other selections will cost you extra. We had the mojo. It was good but again nothing special. I found this experience to be frustrating. You had to cook your own food. So you would put a small piece of meat on the fondue stick and place it in the broth. Then you had to time it. They suggested 2 minutes for the meats. So we were sitting there with our phone timer on boiling meat. 2 minutes was not enough time for my taste. I took my meat out, cut it and blood went all over the plate. I nearly lost it. I do not do rare anything. I am a very well done kind of girl. For me I had to leave the meat in for 4-5 minutes. The meats came with dipping sauces. In my opinion comparable to those you get when ordering chicken nuggets for your kids. Once your meat came out of the pot you had to put another piece in. So while you were doing that your tiny bite of meat that you took out of the boiling water would get cold. The meat was very GOOD! The portion again was small. 
So again you put raw meat in a pot of boiling broth, set the timer on your phone, wait, take the meat out and put it on your plate. Then you grab another piece of meat, put it in the pot of boiling broth, reset the timer and eat the bite you just took out of the pot of broth. 
Finally the chocolate fondue and dessert tray came. Everything was good. 
I honestly feel that this place is over priced. Our bill for 2 people to have a 4 course meal in a tiny booth with a curtain that included rose pedals on the table and a picture was $135. This included tip. We drank water. The food was good, not great. Our server was fine, no issues with her."}
{"text":"Our party of seven came in for Father's Day to take advantage of the $39.95 four course meal with paired craft beers and it was fantastic! Making an appointment was simple and we arrived on time to get seated in a private booth with two burners. The first course was salads and most of us went with the Caesar or House which was topped with a Honey Mustard type dressing. We were then given the option of cheeses (southwestern jalapeno was definitely the best) served with veggies, chips, bread and apples. For the main course we had the endless meat option that included shrimp, filet mignon, chicken, spinach raviolis (my personal favorite) and teriyaki steak. Our waitress gave perfect directions and it's really fun to just de-stress and get to cook each bite and explore all the sauces- there was literally like 8 options! We ended with two chocolate pots served with rice crispies, pound cake, fruits, brownies, etc. Most people couldn't even finish their paired beers as it's A LOT of food and worth the price. One major downfall was the temperature. Once those pots get going and everyone is crowded around the booth it can be very hot- especially when the steam is facing directly at you. Understandably, the restaurant can't do too much, but maybe keep it a bit cooler or use suction fans to extract the heat. I'll definitely be back for happy hour and to redeem my birthday coupon for free strawberries!  P.S. Check their Facebook page for the picture they take of you and your group!"}
{"text":"Great anniversary dinner. Fabulous fondue, service our server Lyric is amazing. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Went for my friends birthday. You really can't go wrong with Melting Pot. This one stands apart for its service. We had a fantastic time and every single person wished her a happy birthday. It was very sweet. Our water glasses were never below half, and our \"dippers\" came out with perfect timing. They also made three special plates for us since we had some food allergies in our group. I really think you should try this one just based on service alone. We had Lisa, and she was adorably sweet."}
{"text":"What a wonderful holiday weekend in a wonderful quite setting. The staff  was great and the beer and wine selection was exceptional. Nice to have this in The Tuke."}
{"text":"I have not had fondue in about 5 years, so I decided to visit The Melting Pot to celebrate my December birthday. From the moment we walked in until we left our experience was fabulous. We were seated in a nice quiet booth in the back. By the midpoint of our dinner, the other tables were sat, so it was nice to have the privacy at the start. The tables face each other is a kind of awkward way (because of the position of the cooktop there really isn't another way to make it work) and in order to keep patrons safe, the lighting cannot be dimmed. We participated in a fundraiser for Helping Hands Arizona, so our menu was a set - 4 course meal. We enjoyed the cheddar for our first round, salads for the second, a nice variety of meats/seafood cooked in the coq au vin style (shrimp & marinated meat were my faves), and for the chocolate round we chose dark chocolate with Bailey's (oreo covered marshmallows & pound cake were the best!) - all courses were delicious. The server and her trainee were extremely informative to the necessary steps to making the meal a success. 

They had asked at the start if we were celebrating anything so I owned up to the fact that it was my birthday. They were kind enough to serve desert on a \"Happy Birthday\" plate (no singing, thank goodness!) and gifted us with some desert to take home! It was more than we expected!. Thanks again for a wonderful evening - we will be back. 

Unfortunately my cell phone would not co-operate last night to post this review but better late than never!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of The Melting Pot. In every city. This was the first time here in Phoenix & my husbands first time ever. The food was (as always) awesome. We went on a Wednesday and there were 12 cars in the parking lot. We waited almost 45 in the bar and although our waiter was training someone, our service continued to decline. To his benefit, he kept apologizing and comped our $10 bottle of wine. After $130 for 2 people, I just wish the service was as good as the food."}
{"text":"I don't \"do\" girls night out.  But for The Melting Pot, I \"did do\" girl's night out.  I went with three girls that I cheered with back in high school.  I mean waaaayyyyy back in high school.  How far back?  No business of yours, sir!  Anyhow, after reconnecting after ...let's call it \"many\" years... the four of us went to TMP for 'couples night'.  We feigned lesbian love in order to fit into a great special, and I'm not afraid to admit it!  No, really, they didn't seem to care, as long as we were in groups of two.  
If you read nothing else, read this:  Plan on three + hours here.  Savor.  Enjoy.  Linger.  It takes that long... it just DOES.  Do not tell your spouse (or babysitter or cat or whomever you answer to) that you'll be home in two hours.  Ahem.
Onward!
Best highlight of the night for me: the Search and Rescue Spoon!!!!!  This struck my funny bone so hard and it was the topic of many jokes and pictures throughout the night.
If you are looking for a place to take kids, do the rest of us a favor:  DON'T COME HERE.  Go someplace where the food is served in nugget form, and removal of shoes is appropriate. We don't want to hear your kids whine or your baby scream.  I have kids but there's a time and a place, people.  The rest of us come to places like this just to get away from you.  
Moving on!
I could wax fond for hours giving loving descriptions of the food here, I really could.  It was both unique AND delicious.  The experience of it is incredibly fun, the atmosphere feels SO intimate somehow (no awkward eye contact with anyone who isn't at your table) and everything about it just amazing.  There was an \"appetizer\" course, a \"main\" course, and a \"dessert\" course.  You can choose to dip or cook your food in any kind of cheese or broth... but let's be honest, it's all foreplay leading up to to what really matters there:  the dessert course.  
We chose the \"S'mores\" dessert experience.  I'm not being pretentious... it really is an *experience*.  Just think:a giant pot of melted chocolate, swirled with marshmallow cream, which gets some sort of flammable (I'm assuming liquor) poured on top and set on fire, which toasts the marshmallow creme, and THEN they add the crushed graham crackers.... and after THAT we got to dip things like cheesecake, rice krispy treats, poundcake, strawberries, and brownies in the hot melty S'morey goodness... let me just say that I briefly experienced Nirvana.
Yes, yes, I hear people say it's expensive, and I guess that is relative.  If you've stayed at the Aria, or in a suite at Mandalay Bay, or anywhere decent in Vegas for a week and paid $40 for a drink poolside, then comparatively/relatively....  it was downright cheap.  
(If you get all indignant over anything that doesn't come from the dollar menu at McDonalds, then don't go to Vegas and don't go to The Melting Pot.  Seriously, just stay at home and crab about inflation and watch some public television, you'll be happier.)    As for me, the whole point of working is to earn money that then enables me to go places and eat things and buy stuff for my family.  This falls in the category of \"going to a Place\" and \"eating Things\" so I was happy.
Once we split up the dinner bill, I felt that my portion (including the completely  optional dessert course and one adult beverage- so if you must be a tightwad you could do it for less than I did) of only $40 was downright freaking CHEAP, worth every last cent and then some... and I can't wait to go back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A bit overpriced for melted cheese, but always tasty.  The tricks are going on the girls night out - a fixed price 3 course menu or during happy hour for cheese and chocolate.  Staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"What a fun experience! The staff here is so friendly, helpful, and prompt! We came here for our anniversary dinner and will definitely be back! The prices are expensive but it's so worth it for what you get. This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Ok
I hate doing this
I really wish I didn't love a chain fondue restaurant more than the independant fondue places in AZ...

But Melting Pot does fondue very well.  Better than the other fondue options.

I'm not a fan of their cheese

However, their Yin Yang chocolate fondue is SO FREAKING GOOD

So yeah.
Darn.  I love the Melting Pot."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money, this place sucks big time.  Tasteless food, shotty service. I would never go back!"}
{"text":"I can never get enough of this place!! We came for cheese and chocolate this trip and it was fantastic and our server Lyric was as sweet as could be!! Thank you for another awesome experience!!  See you soon..."}
{"text":"I have been making my husband take me to the Melting Pot for the past 10 years for my birthday, our anniversary, special occasions (the Easton/Columbus, OH location). Eventually, he grew to enjoy it also. We visit at least 4 times a year and have always had a nice experience.
We moved to AZ last year and have been to the Phoenix location once prior to this encounter (with average at best service), and twice at the Scottsdale location (had good service).
We decided to invite a group of friends for fondue before New Year. None of our friends had dined at a Melting Pot before, so we wanted them to experience what we had in the past.
The Scottsdale location is far superior (ambience, service, decor, etc.), however, the Phoenix location was more central to all of our friends to meet at. I made reservations 2 weeks prior for our group.
I checked in the hostess desk and most of our group had arrived. I asked the hostess if she could direct our missing friends to our table when they arrived. She took us to out table, which was in the back part of the restaurant next to a restroom and some abandoned chairs and supplies. (Messy). There was no privacy in this room (and not much privacy at this location in general) In other locations you get a nice private table/space, a table with a high partition, or a curtain.
When our friends joined us at the table, they said the person at the desk gave them a hard time about which party they were with. They only found us because another staff member decided to help them.
Our waiter came to the table and took our drink orders. That took a while (fine), and 2 came back wrong. Then, the waiter asked us what cheese style we wanted. We looked at the menu, picked 2 styles. He disappeared. A long while later he appeared with the pots, cheese, dippers. ...the weird part? He was handing out plates and doing all of this when we hadn't even ordered our meals yet. We still had our tacky, plastic menu placecards. I started wondering if we were going to be eating that night at all at this point (it had been almost an hour). My husband started to lose his patience and asked if he could place his salad and entree order so he could remove the giant menu and have a place for his plate/bread/cheese. It was really bizarre. During the meal random young staff members stopped at our table and awkwardly asked us questions-once we were eating and a girl wanted to take our picture for the Facebook page.
Usually the waiter starts out the meal with an explanation of the experience, cooking styles etc. And usually, you and your waiter chit chat because they spend so much time prepping and stirring the food. This time we hardly saw or spoke with our waiter. At the end of the meal he brought one check and never asked if we wanted it split. By the end of this ordeal we all just wanted to get out of there as fast as we could.
This experience was so awful it makes me question my love for this place. The service was awful, the overall experience was horrible, the ambience was non-existent, the decor cheap and tacky. 
Our friends were confused and unhappy with the experience (first time visitors). They all said they would not return.
I would never recommend this location.  And with an almost $500 dinner tab and complete garbage service and experience,  I don't think I will be returning much in the new year. Save yourself a lot of money and grief and avoid this location like the plague.
So amazingly disappointing."}
{"text":"Went out for a girls night, had so much fun! Great dining experience and the bartender Alex was great! I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter here last night for her 10th birthday with 10 other people. I called a few days before and made a reservation. Our table was ready for us when we arrived. We tried all 3 cheese's and they were phenomenal! I ordered the land and sea and it was awesome! Our service was great and the staff were friendly, accommodating, and they all had a great sense of humor. They were detailed when it came to directions for how to cook the food and answered all of our questions. They checked on us and cleared the table without us having to ask. The white chocolatier fondue with pound cake was one of the best things I have ever had. This place is worth the price and the experience was unforgettable!! We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Listened to OpenTable request to sit in a secluded area, which was great. Food and service was excellent. Great specials make the cost worth-while and valuable. Fun, delicious dining experience. We'll probably be back sooner than we thought! Such a great restaurant for special occasions."}
{"text":"We came on Mother's Day. It was clean and quiet, nice atmosphere. We ended up having to wait quite a while in between courses because the kitchen was backed up. Our server was wonderful and the manager noticed we had to keep waiting and took great care of us during the meal and in the end. We drove from Queen Creek to Ahwatukee especially for the delicious chocolate fondue! Well done, we'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!  I've been wanting to come here for so long.  DH & I finally made it out here and it was all I ever hoped for it to be.  The food was fantastic and our server was great.  We ordered the Big Night Out which includes smoked cheddar with Sam Adam's cheese fondue, wedge salads, variety of meat to dip in fondue for entree and a milk chocolate fondue for dessert.  We were stuffed by the end of our meal.  Wouldn't change a thing!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of fondue and this place has got it down right.  A four course meal is the way to go, starting out with a cheese fondue of your choice, then a salad, then an entree (I prefer the broth for dipping rather than the oil as it makes the meat just so darn tender), and then of course, the dessert in the form of a chocolate fondue.  The seating is very intimate and private in large booths.  This is not a place to go for a quick meal, but a place to savor the food and the company."}
{"text":"I'd give this restaurant a thousand stars if i could. My husband and I are doing the Keto-diet. The manager and server went above and beyond to accomidate us. We assumed we just wouldn't eat dessert because we can only eat 70%+ dark chocolate and berries. The manager came and asked us about our diet restrictions, drove to the grocery store and purchased the right kind of dark chocolate and berries to make a Keto-friendly fondue, no extra charge, and even after we told him it wasnt at all expected. I never knew this kind customer service existed. I always loved this restaurant but they just made a very happy customer out of me. Also it was my birthday, so that made it an extra special night. Thank you Melting Pot for a wonderful dinner and birthday dessert!"}
{"text":"Folks, I'm sorry if this review comes across as snooty, which it probably is. But can you really fault me for that, when I brought my Parisian then-wife to this place and one of the first things they told us was, \"Since you've never dined with us before, just so you know, what we do here is give you an authentic European style meal.\" Amused at this bold proclamation that we were about to get an \"authentic European style meal\" at a Florida-based chain restaurant on Ray Road, we stifled our laughter as our teenage waiter proceeded to tell us what it means to eat food \"European style\". 

Apparently, a genuine Yorapeon experience consists of a vat of melted chocolate followed by a vat of melted cheese. Not at the same time! That would be American style. No, see, the European way is to bring the vats out in succession. And charge $8 billion for it. Even though I last dined here with mon epouse 3 years ago, I actually remember to this day that our bill was $75 for two including wine pre-tip, which we both thought was a major rip-off. 

I do have a logical reason to give this place a bad review. The problem we had with the Melting Pot was simply that it claims to be something that it is not. I've been to fondue places in France and Switzerland, and the Melting Pot is sure as hell nothing like those. Which would be fine if it weren't playing it up to consumers like it was. And it would also be fine if it didn't cost as much to dine here as it costs to dine at a TRULY authentic French/European restaurant in town, such as Sophie's or Vincent's. This place draws you in by claiming to give you a \"European\" experience, which it simply doesn't do. Why would you want to pay 50 bucks a person for that? 

I will say that the atmosphere is cozy, comfortable, and affords you privacy to enjoy a romantic meal with your significant other. Granted. And I have no complaints about the quality or taste of the food either. Also granted. But if I feel like splurging a hundred bucks on a romantic meal with someone, I just don't understand why anyone would do so at this national chain wannabe-slash-poser restaurant instead of a truly nice, unique, authentic place elsewhere in the Valley. Va Bene is only a mile or two away, after all.

To each their own."}
{"text":"What another fun night out with the hubby!!! We can for a late Valentine's Day dinner. The food was AMAZING and they had a great deal going on for V-day!!  When you go you HAVE to buy there garlic and wine seasoning! It is SO DELICIOUS on ANYTHING!!! I don't recommend upgrading the cooking style, stick with the classic bullion. It's the best!! If want chocolate covered strawberries make sure you order them when you make the reservation. They DO NOT have them on hand. This is definitely one of my favorite places to enjoy a nice long relaxing meal!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service by Megan, she made our dining experience amazing. Thank you and we will highly recommend the melting pot to all our friends."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials! They also do a special during the summer when the temp hits a certain point they give free chocolate or cheese fondue to they're facebook fans."}
{"text":"I was not a believer, but one of my friends said I would not be disappointed so I gave it a shot  Happy Hour in the bar is $5 a person per section ($5 cheese, $5 chocolate, $4, salad, and drink specials as well).  I was super surprised, it was all really good of course, and I was FULL!!!  Also, you can have more bread and dessert for free if you have and of your cheesy or chocolatey goodness left!  Took a lot of time, I think we were there for like 2 hours but I would do it again."}
{"text":"My Wife and I love the melting pot.  Great food, romantic setting, attentive service, and fun concept.  They offer an ample gluten free selection for me while still giving my wife the ability to eat off the normal menu.  We always plan a couple of hours when we visit and turn it into an event...not a meal.  Turtle chocolate fondue is the best...give it a shot!"}
{"text":"We've been trying to use our Living Social deal to this place for a couple months now... we finally had the chance on Saturday night.  My take on Melting Pot has always been that the cheese and the dessert are awesome - but that I could pretty much do without the meat course in the middle.

So we started with the spinach artichoke cheese fondue, which was really really good.  The wedge salad with bacon and peppercorn ranch, also good.  Then we got to the meat course.  Without turning this into a novel, we discovered that one of the shrimp that had been cooking in our broth fhad not been de-turded.  That's right, it had been cooking with the rest of our meat, in poo-broth.  

So, there goes the appetite, and after bringing it up to the waiter - and his discussing it with the manager - they were \"gracious\" enough to take a $5 beer off our tab.

I'm sorry, but serving poop to customers, should pretty much be a no-no.  Especially at those prices.  I kept thinking of the line from one of my favorite movies, The Jerk, \"You would think, at these prices, you could keep the POOP off the food!\".

I digress... suffice it to say, we won't be going back to The Melting Pot."}
{"text":"The food is great as usual. And the service there never disappoints. Jeremy was awesome. 

Fondue Feast. Lager and Cheddar Cheese fondue. The meats had the advertising Latin spin for the current Big Night Out. The dessert was dark chocolate with sea salt. All was A-OK.

The table next to us was inhabited by two of the most annoying groups of diners I've ever experienced. When we arrived, the meal was winding down for a mother, her 13-ish old daughter, and that daughter's friend. If they hadn't been so young, I would have sworn the girls were drunk off their respective asses. They kept screaming across the restaurant for the waiter, thinking they were going to hook him up with their cougar mom. I'm thinking that probably wasn't an option, as I'm pretty sure the waiter didn't play for that team. But hearing yells of  \"WE NEED MORE NAPKINS JEREMY\" was enough to make want to throw hot bouillon over the wall onto their skank little heads.

We had about 15 minutes of quiet after they left, until this weird older couple was seated at the same table. The woman had a ghastly hat that looked like she had shopped at Savers for a hat to wear to the Churchill Downs. It was white with lots of lace and feathers and crap. And she left it on the entire meal. They went on an on with the waiter about how it was their 24th anniversary, we got to hear about restaurants that the husband was \"forbidden to go to\" because of his flatulence, we were subjected to them listening to Jack Johnson on their phone, and had to hear their incessant nincompoopery while we finished our dessert.

Love the Melting Pot, but maybe will go to one in a different area of town next time."}
{"text":"Me and my wife have been coming here for years. A cozy, romantic place to celebrate an anniversary, birthday or a date. You want a place for a first date? Come here. We always go with the four-course dinner. Everything is included. You get your cheese fondue, I recommend the \"Fiesta\" cheese. You get a great salad and then you choose your entries and finish with a chocolate fondue. The entire time your are here is so relaxing. We have been here for 1-2 hours, just enjoying each other. You lose track of time, because there is no hurry. You cook everything at your table in the pot on your table. Its so fun and different. We are always treated so good here. Now you will spend some money here, but if you really want a special night, this  is the place. I Give it a GIANT Woo Hoo!"}
{"text":"Fondue, first time I've partaken in this special way of eating. Hot chocolate sauce, and peanut butter, with very different types of treats. Will definitely come back to try the dinner service. PS, excellent place to take a date."}
{"text":"Rip off.  The only reason I did not give this place a one star is because we did not get sick.  The place is way too expensive for what you get.  I ask the girl if the meat was frozen, she replied how could you tell. The taste give it away."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a gift card and decided to come here for his birthday. This was our first time coming to Melting Pot. The first thing I noticed is how underwhelming the decor inside the restaurant is- for such an expensive experience, you would think the ambiance would be modern. Our waiter was nice and attentive- we also got our picture taken but never saw it at the end of the night. Our waiter explained the cooking process and options on the menu, including drinks. We went with the 4 course option and stated with the fontina cheese fondue. Neither my husband or I liked it- it's a very pungent flavor. One thing we learned quickly is if you want something cooked, it needs to be at the very bottom of the pot (raw veggies served in the first course don't taste good with hot cheese in my opinion). Anyways, next were salads, which we LOVED. I ordered the California and he ordered the Apple Bacon. I literally want to make the raspberry vinaigrette dressing at home because it was THAT good! Next was the meat course- I went with the pacific rim (pot-stickers, duck, sirloin and shrimp)- hubby had the land and sea (filet, shrimp, and chicken). We went with the mojo sauce to cook the meat and it provided some flavor but not a lot. We ended up adding other flavors in the pot to make the flavors pop. The sauces they provide on the side are very good, especially the greek goddess sauce for the mushrooms- stuff them after they cook and they are amazing! 

Take away from this dining experience- I know it's supposed to be an \"experience\" cooking your food but when you only get 2 skewers at a time, it takes FOREVER to get through all the meat and veggies they give you on the side to cook. The potatoes were in the pot from the beginning of the meat cooking process and they never really cooked all the way through- why potatoes? By the time we finished dinner, we were exhausted and hot (the cooking pot being in front of you for 2+ hours makes the space a little toasty). 

For dessert, we went with the smores fondue, which was the best thing we ate all night. It came with brownies, strawberries, pineapple, banana, shortcake and rice krispies. It was also nice because it came on a happy birthday plate and we sang to my husband for his birthday. We also had a coupon for chocolate covered strawberries and received a box at the end of dinner (call ahead for those though). And, if you check in on Yelp, you get a free bottle of the garlic and wine seasoning. 

I can't say the service or food wasn't great because it was and I have no complaints there. My husband and I both agreed we just didn't enjoy the 2.5 hour dinner experience enough to come back. We also thought it was really expensive ($125 for 2 people). I'm glad we tried this but I don't know if we would really want to come back."}
{"text":"The melting pot is always a great place to go with a date, it is nice because the dinner is an experience, and the staff is in no hurry to get you moving so they can fit another table in. 

I have to knock down a star because they took away the quattro formaggio cheese (the reason I went to this place as often as I did). The spinach and artichoke is pretty good, and the desert is always amazing. I have always enjoyed every server we have had at the melting pot, they are so nice and really knowledgable on all of the food. It is a little pricey sure but well worth it if you need a comfort food fix."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful evening at The Melting Pot Ahwatukee. Lavonte was our server and did  a great job of suggesting  menu items and combinations. We did the fondue raiser giving back program which was awesome because it was unlimited proteins for the main course. Shrimp and filet was great and even had a second portion of those. 
The GM stopped by several times to check on our dining experience. Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Fun experience, bacon Gorgonzola cheese was yummy.   Carmel toffee chocolate is tasty!!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to the Melting Pot. It's been on our \"must try\" list for a very long time.  I've seen some reviews that complain about the service, but we didn't have any complaints. We were immediately seated (we did have reservations) and promptly served. This is not a quick dining experience,  so come prepared to spend some time and bit be in a rush.

We had 4 in our party. We each ordered the unlimited 4 course meal, which is by far the best value. The cheese course was yummy, but word to the wise - don't fill up on bread! The Caprese salads were perfect - very fresh. The meat course was great. We had filet, teriyaki steak, shrimp, ravioli, and chicken. We also added the lobster tail for an additional $8. Everything was fresh, tender and delicious!

We ended our dinner with the Chocolate Turtle fondue for dessert. Fabulous! Just wish we weren't so full so we could've eaten more. 

Our server, Steven, was on the ball, did a great job explaining everything, and we were quite impressed. 

Be prepared to spend a decent chunk of change there. You're paying for the experience and extra work the servers have to do, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"For my first visit to The Melting Pot, I decided to go on my birthday with my husband, my parents and his parents.
We were sat in a back room all by ourselves. Literally we could have heard a pin drop. Normally, I would have LOVED this ... However it must have been a package deal: get your own room, get crappy service.
Granted, I didn't expect to be in and out of the place within an hour, but I also didn't expect it to take three and a half hours either! Our server was SO slow. We normally NEVER have a lack of dinner conversation, however we found ourselves twiddling our thumbs just waiting for our server several times.
The food, however, was delicious. But NOT worth the prices they charge.
Unfortunately, this was my first and last visit to The Melting Pot."}
{"text":"As always great service and food! Went for date night on a Friday and was seated quickly and with an amazing waiter! Had the spinach artichoke cheese fondue, chicken in court bouillon and the strawberry shortcake chocolate fondue...All of it was AMAZING!! I also had the sailor's punch which was nice and fruity. The total for two with drinks was just under $100 so it's not a cheap night out...but definitely worth it every once in a while :D"}
{"text":"Seven of us took my daughter there for her birthday. The service was incredibly slow. Over three hours for food we cooked at the table!  The food quality seemed ok but the bill was over $500 and only two alcoholic drinks were served. When we left my 28 year old son wanted to stop and grab a burger. He is not overweight in the slightest and there was not enough food for him. After talking to the remaining guests everyone felt that way. I'll never be back. I'd rather spend $700 at a better restaurant.  Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"Had such a great Date Night here last night with the hubby, fantastic service by our waiter Conan, food was amazing and the cocktails were delicious! The intimacy and ambiance is unbeatable, we'll definitely go here again and again!"}
{"text":"The melting pot use to be the place to go to have a great time and have great service! We had gone to the one in north scottsdale the last two times and had horrible service so we decided to give this location a try. 

The actual taste of the dessert was probably the only good thing going however, the restaurant use to offer more of each item of the desserts and when we asked why it changed our waitress explained it was because people would sit for hours upon hours just enjoying dessert asking for more pieces to enjoy their chocolate with. Changing their menu for everything to be a la carte but keeping the same prices (each item at least $40) does not make it very affordable for many people. The only restaurant that we knew of for charging a $1 refill on soda and lemonade products. 

We decided to go with a couple which probably made it better then it would have been had we of been by ourselves, as our waitress was rude, did not like us asking questions or wanting us to change our minds. She was difficult to stop to ask for something and did not have very nice facial expressions."}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal, but it really is super expensive for what it is.  Which makes it perfect for a special but rare occasion.

Price: it runs between $16-$25 per course, so by the time u have a cheese appetizer,($16 serves two) entree ($25 per person), salad ($8 per person) and dessert, ($16-$32 serves two) you end up with a $100+ tab.   Significantly more if you order drinks.

My issue: don't get me wrong, the food really was superb.  However, the reason my review is so critical is because they have a happy hour 4-6, which significantly cheapens their prices.  I went especially for this after reading about it on yelp and on their site. But when I got there it wasn't mentioned at all, and even though we ordered supposed \"happy hour\" items there was no discount whatsoever, and my server didn't seem to know anything about it.  I felt sort of misled.

So good food.  High prices.  Left feeling kind of disappointed by the happy hour thing, so I'm really not sure I'd go back.  Would've been a good experience if we hadn't been jilted on the pricing."}
{"text":"Had been to a restaurant of this sort for the first time. I liked the idea of having a stove on the table and the chef preparing fondue on it. I admire the food, the ambience, the decorum of the chefs. The best thing about the menu here is the dark chocolate fondue. It was heaven!"}
{"text":"I love the melting pot! This was my first time at this location and it was a little bit different from what I remember it being. 

The portions are smaller, but you can always ask for more dippers outside of the meats. This was the first time I ever took my kids, but they loved it. So tonight's dinner was a success. 

For dessert I always order the yin and yang, but with milk chocolate. When it arrived it was with dark. My kids were getting a little restless so I didn't say anything, but it is much better with milk chocolate. 

Outside of that small hiccup our server was pretty good and we will be back the next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Feeling generous with the one star today. Food was good but service was lacking. I don't believe that you should have to wait 30-40minutes for water to arrive at your table or watch your appetizer pot steam for that long either.  The bad service outweighed the food this time. Disappointed. Seems like the Melting Pot should read some of these reviews to make improvements."}
{"text":"Love this place. Had wonderful service. 
Will be back again. 
Food was amazing. 
We did the full blown fondue for party of 6. We all had a blast and enjoyed all the food.  The desert was out standing. Never had fondue desert before here and I will most definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for our valentines day dinner. It was excellent. Obviously it's more on the expensive side, so it may not be an \"everyday\" kind of place, but if you're looking for something for a special occasion or a romantic night out, this place is perfect.

My girlfriend is allergic to gluten and they had no problems accommodating that restriction. They all knew immediately what to do and we're knowledgable on the menu as it related to gluten.

Our server was a guy named Dan, and he was friendly, attentive, knowledgable and helpful throughout the whole meal. He suggested good foods, gluten free foods, good wines and answered any questions. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the melting pot."}
{"text":"We went here tonight for our anniversary.  This is our second visit to this location, and it has been a wonderful experience both times. 

I have always been impressed with the friendliness of the staff and their professional manner.  We have always come with coupons because it's the only way we can afford to go, and even though they are a high-end place, they have never looked down on us for that or treated us poorly.  We still feel like we're getting the best experience.  I wish I could remember our server's name, because she was wonderful.  

The food, of course, was delicious.  We had the spinach artichoke cheese and endless entrees. Our server recommended the Mojo broth, and it was awesome!  Flavorful, tangy, and a little bit of spice. It went well with everything.  I don't think I tried anything I didn't like.  

If you have never been here before, one thing to keep in mind is that it's a very intimate dining experience.  I recommend it for families and serious couples. You'll be eating close together since you're sharing a fondue pot, and this also means you're all putting your skewers in the same pot, so don't go there with anyone you wouldn't feel comfortable doing this with!  And also, it's expensive, so I wouldn't recommend it for a first date. 

I think this is a lovely place for special occasions, and I look forward to future celebrations there."}
{"text":"We have come here several times and always have a good experience! The last couple times the service has been soooo slow! For $160 the service needs to be more then 20 min waits just to get refills on soda.  It will be awhile before we come  back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Ahwatukee establishment using the Living Social voucher. This was our very first visit and it may be our last. Let's just say for the actual price of the food that this restaurant isn't worthy of a revisit. 

Our waitress was nice but she wasn't attentive and she was quite sloppy. For instance, when taking our menu's away, instead of walking away with them she just places it on the wall divider between us and the adjacent booth. The menus were just lying around there the entire time, never picked up just flopping over into the other booth!!! Our waitress NEVER rounded, we kept on looking for her and another waitress from the table across from us ended up refilling our waters because she was taking forever when rounding. We noticed the waitress across from us was very good to their party, constantly rounding and making sure everybody had their refills and checking in on the food and if they wanted more entrees. Although our entrees were bottomless, we only received two platters because again our waitress took FOREVER to return to our table. By the time we received the second plate of meats our fondue practically ran out of steam and juice!! She also forgot about our champagne, gave us the check and walked away. We had to yet again ask for her because she took 10 hours long, then when she finally came back we explained we didn't receive our champagne and she was just like, \"oh ya, i'll be back,\" didn't even apologized, was all nonchalant about it and we were like \"really???\" The service, at least from our waitress was ridiculous, we wished we had the other one sitting across from us who refilled our drinks, then maybe our experience would have been better.

Lastly, the decor!!!! Seriously for such a \"high end\" establishment, this place could use lots of remodeling... the decor is very 1990's and needs a make-up STAT!

We will give em props on the food, because it was DELICIOUS!! The salad wasn't a big deal, but the appetizers were AMAZING, same with the entrees, the meats were tender and succulent!! But alas, the lack of customer service from our waitress killed it for us, unfortunately.... :/

We wanted to love this place, but uh, we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Seriously the funniest night we've had out!! Jeremy our waiter made the night! We'll definitely be back and asking for Jeremy!"}
{"text":"Look, I had a gift card for $10 and no reason to go to The Melting Pot. So already this wasn't going to be the best experience ever.

The two stars I'm giving were for the first time I called to see if they would just do a ceaser salad w/chicken to go. I called around 2, not knowing this was a dinner only restaurant, but the lady I spoke to said she could prepare the salad for me, just not the chicken because the cooks weren't even in yet. She was very nice and I appreciated her willingness to accommodate me HOURS before they even open. But I decided to skip it, not wantging her to go to the trouble when they were closed. On her own, this lady was 4-5 stars,  and I wished I would've just had her make the salad. 

Ok. Skip ahead a week. Now I'm sick and call about 8 at night to see if I can pick up the salad on my way home from work. I'm told they don't do to go orders. I tell the girl I spoke with someone last week and she said no problem, so this girl puts me on hold to speak w/ a manager. She comes back and says yes to the salad, no to the chicken because they have no way to cook it. So, within 1 week, a restaurant has lost the ability to cook a chicken breast. Really? .... so I ask for a cup of hot tea, since I'm sick. She says \"I promise you, there is no way I can give a to go drink\". Oh, but I can take a teabag if I really need it.

I tell her to forget the whole thing. Way too difficult of a conversation, especially when 1)I'm ill and 2) a week earlier it was no problem. So now I have a giftcard, no salad, and a bad taste in my mouth from the experience"}
{"text":"You guyssssss. Melted cheese. Cooking your own food. Melted chocolate. WINE!  

Seriously LOVE this place! Our waitress was a doll. She was super nice and knew answers to all our questions-they have a lot to memorize! 

First of all we got a bottle of Riesling. 

We got the spinach artichoke cheese fondue to start. They bring out the spinach in full leaves (wish they were chopped). It was delicious. I suggest not trying the brown sweet bread they bring with it... why melting pot??? The chips and other bread is delicious with it, though. 

I forgot the name of the cooking style we got but I believe it had a Cajun feel..? Was delicious with the spinach ravioli and chicken. My bf loves the steak and LOVES the shrimp. 

Get the toffee chocolate option, trust me. It's so damn good. They bring you such yummy berries and shortbread. They also have options to add a pice of cheesecake to dip, so. Stir ally we got it  

5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Our visit was the climax to a wonderful eveing out and the staff were so awesome in describing their menu and how it all worked."}
{"text":"My husband and I were celebrating our 16th anniversary and decided to try this establishment.  I'm thrilled we did!!

When I made the reservation- they provided a list of options to make our evening memorable!!  We had a great meal and a great"}
{"text":"Great place for a date night! Don't come really hungry. I recommend going for drinks and dessert."}
{"text":"The service was slow and the restaurant is dated. The price and quality of food do not match up. Fun for once but maybe not again."}
{"text":"Prior to arriving to the Melting Pot we made reservations for 4 (the next table was available at 9pm) and had looked at some of their specials. We knew they had a three course option for $30 since it was AZ Restaurant Week and they also had a company special which was endless fondue (which was really just endless entree) for around $37. Half of us were carnivores and opted for this choice, which caused real confusion for our waiter, so we all agreed to just pay the $7 more (not a big deal since we were getting endless shrimp and filet). The cheese course was fine but the salads were small and mediocre. When the salads arrived we had asked for salt, which our waiter never brought. One person in our party had been waiting to enjoy their salad with some salt so it wasn't until another employee dropped our entree broth 10 minutes later that we got the salt. After a lengthy wait,(I believe there was now only one other table in the place), our server came to ask if we would like to order drink refills first before he brought our long anticipated entree....Finally, we received our entree, perhaps adequate for two people, but certainly not four. The waiter did make a good recommendation on the mojo cooking style (but had implied that it was included in the price of the special). After sitting with no food for another 20+ minutes, we were given the dessert menu, I asked about refills on the beef and shrimp. He later returned with 5 shrimp and about 6 bite size portions of beef. Five minutes later, we began our wait again for our next \"endless entree\" refill. The waiter returned to our table and asked if we would like to take our dessert to go?!! Really?!! Sure, let me just swing past Williams-Sonoma & pick up a fondue set! He seemed a bit shocked when we said no and advised him we had been waiting for more shrimp. We wanted one more refill when he came to the table with another employee following behind us holding our dessert (who then proceeded to turn around in a very disgruntled manner). I would have been more understanding if they had been busy or we had not seen the waitstaff standing idly while we were waiting for food and drink refills. It took 3 hours and $240 to have what you you would normally enjoy in appetizers or at a tapas bar. Again, no complaints on the food quality, but the slow service and lack of refills on both food and drinks made it seem like the most expensive meal, gram for gram, that I have ever eaten. I would have much rather spent it at a nice steak or seafood establishment. The decor is also quite dated and not nearly as \"romantic\" as I had envisioned. Probably an OK place to take a first date and share an appetizer fondue before going somewhere for a real dinner."}
{"text":"The cheese and dessert courses were very nice but the main courses were disappointing in quality.   Even more disappointing, a mandatory 20% tip for mediocre service.   As empty as the restaurant was, we still couldn't get our servers attention regarding drink orders during the meal nor when we tried to order additional food.   Go for a pre-dinner appetizer or a post-dinner dessert but skip the overpriced main meal and you'll have a better experience."}
{"text":"This place confuses me. Paying an arm and a leg to cook my own food just isn't for me. However I think it could be a nice place to go for dessert and wine."}
{"text":"Try the Love Martini. It is fantastic!

Three starts because it is super pricey. The waitress also thought I was strange because I asked her to not add the mushrooms to the fondue pot. Also, we had a bit of a disagreement when I said we did not have one in North Dakota. She insisted that we did, only to be proven wrong at desert.

Good place for a romantic date, but next time I am going to look for a small less chain like place to eat."}
{"text":"This is the best place for a delcious relaxing meal- we had 7 in our party & had the 4 course meal- had a good variety of cheeses, salads, entrees & dessert- all excellent!
We will be going back!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience!  This is a really nice place to go for special occasions.  The booths are so private with the curtains and the service is excellent!  The food is amazing and the experience is unique."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I have been to the melting pot before. It was my husbands first time.  I have enjoyed my experiences so I asked my husband to take me there for my birthday. We got there and everything seemed fine. It took a while to get our drinks but we got them and they were OK. When our first course came the vegetables were a little old. They weren't fresh and the bread was hard although the cheese tasted delicious. Our server was a little \"green\" so to speak (or new). He didn't have the type of experience you would expect when you're paying 100+ dollars for dinner. Before we were even done with our cheese course, the server took all of our plates with veggies still left on them and didn't ask if we were finished. When we got our entrée course, the food was good and we enjoyed that course of the meal. However the server again try to take a plate that had food left on it. We had to tell him that we weren't finished with it yet. When we got our last entrée, the chocolate fondue, our silverware and plates were dirty and we had to ask A busboy to replace them for us. He did and brought us additional plate ware, what his response was \"OK\" and walked away. Again for the price of the dinner you would expect something a little bit more. The server never came back to apologize or mention anything about the dirty silverware or plates. In addition the staff were in Jeans with sneakers. Which in most situations I'm OK with, however with a type of dinner that you're looking for at a place like this I was assuming something a little bit more classy. The server dropped off the check and told us to take our time and within 3 minutes came back opened the check in front of us and said \"is this ready yet?\" And clearly we hadn't opened it or even finished our last course. Our experience wasn't horrible but for the price that is why am giving it one star because it wasn't enjoyable. The Decour is outdated and it's not something I would do again for a $160 meal. Spend your money at the capital Grille or something else where you know you're going to get a good experience. I will say the hostess was nice and when my husband made the reservation he had told them it was my birthday. The hostess told me happy birthday and was super friendly. Although when we were seated the server asked us what occasion we were here for which I thought was kind of weird because the hostess had just told me happy birthday."}
{"text":"After my first trip to the Melting Pot, I was in awe over the experience. We started out with a cheese appetizer (which I wasn't in love with), then went for 2 different appetizers, and then the amazing chocolate dessert. The entrees were delicious, but for the small amount of meat actually served, it is extremely overpriced. But, the atmosphere is actually worth the money. The whole restaurant is quiet, perfect for a night of conversation. 

And, back to the dessert. Melted chocolate fondue with all sorts of yummy treats to dip: fruits, cheesecake, marshmallows, brownies, etc, etc. Mmmmmm! Just the dessert, quiet atmosphere, and the bottle of wine had me sold on the evening. 

But, like all others have said, it is very pricey. It was about $140 for 2 of us; including a bottle of wine, an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert plate."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed.  Let me walk you through it:

1) The restaurant it self needs to be updated.  The ambiance and décor was similar to that of a Black Angus.  Just not very classy.  Tables were pretty small too.

2) The service was slightly lacking in the sense I waited about 20 minutes for my cocktail.  Other than that our server was pleasant and patient with me as a first timer

3) I had the Moscato Mule which tasted like soda.  Barely any vodka in my $15 drink.  My friend had the red sangria which was bitter.  I wanted a glass of champagne which they did not offer.  Just a flat super sweet prosecco. 

4)  We started with the Alpine cheese fondue which tasted like pure white wine.  We then switched to the Cheddar fondue which was actually pretty tasty

5) I ordered the Caesar salad which had these weird sweet crunchy things on it which did not compliment the salad at all.  I took a couple of bites and that was enough

6) I ordered the Surf and Turf with the Coq Au Vin cooking style.  The flavor was so bland and disappointing.  For a filet and lobster meal, this fell very short

7) The yin and yang chocolate was our dessert.  The white chocolate portion was delicious.  Best part of the whole night

8) My bill, for just me, was $62 BEFORE tip!  For this kind of money I expect to be wowed not underwhelmed which is exactly what I was 

9) After all of this, I ended my night on the toilet!  My stomach was so upset from this!  Maybe this was TMI but seriously!"}
{"text":"Melting pot is nestled away here in ahwatukee and great for locals in the area. We came in for a birthday party where if you sign up for a promo they will give you free chocolate covered strawberries. 

The wait staff was very nice and cordial, the food was good too, but you'll have to consider that there is a very long wait between courses and this meal took us 3 hrs and 15 minutes on a Tuesday night...."}
{"text":"We had the four course experience tonight and we even had our four year old with us. The food was great. The service was exceptional. Our waiter (Clayton) was very attentive and made our experience really great. The manager came by to ensure that everything was good and we had no complaints. Definitely recommend this one!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I took the family in tonight. Our own 4 teens and a friend of one of our sons visiting from CA. We had a super experience. The food was as always great but most importantly, our service by CJ our waiter was so impressive. Such good customer service! Thank you for the good evening!"}
{"text":"We came here for my wife's Birthday.  It was my first experience at The Melting Pot and it was a great one.  We were greeted upon walking in and seated right away.  They seated us in a small private booth for two which was very nice.  Each of the booths has a curtain that they pull shut so you feel like you are all alone.  There was only a \"dull roar\" from the other guests in the restaurant, so it was very nice.  

Our server was excellent.  She was outgoing and very helpful in explaining the menu.  We got the cheese and chocolate fondue with a salad.  All three courses were great.  We had the cheddar fondue which you can't go wrong with.  The different varieties of bread that we dipped in the fondue with delicious. My wife and I both got the house salad, hers with ranch and I got mine with the house dressing.  My dressing was sweet and the salad was very good. I would probably try it with ranch next time as ranch is my go-to dressing.  We finished off with the chocolate fondue which was amazing.  It had strawberries, rice-crispy treats, marshmallows, etc.  Dessert was the best course of the meal.  

It was a little on the pricey side for us, but a great choice for special occasions and well worth it!  It may be my choice for my Birthday dinner later this year :)"}
{"text":"Paul Fratella (General Manager of Melting Pot) knows the meaning of extraordinary customer care.  I took today off from work to take my daughter, who had always wanted try fondue, to Shabu Fondue (they are the closest to our home).  Their website said they were open as of 11 a.m. M-F.  My daughter was so disappointed when we arrived to see that they were closed.  My heart sank.  I called The Melting Pot in Ahwatukee & Paul stated they didn't open until 5 p.m.  We had to pick up my other daughter by 5:30 p.m.  We were so bummed that our special fondue day wasn't going to happen.  Paul sensed the disappointment in my voice and kindly offered to open his doors for us to enjoy lunch.  I was shocked.  My daughter looked as though we had won free tickets to Disneyland.  The rest of the experience just got better & better.  Paul, the General Manager, served us and made us feel special.  It was thrilling to see a big smile on my daughter's face.  Paul transformed our dismal day into a dynamic one.  The food was delicious (fresh, flavorful and filling) and the variety was incredible.  To top it off, they took a picture of us & framed it in a Melting Pot silver frame.  We were impressed and WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Our server Alexandra was excellent! Service is quick, friendly and helpful. :) it's nice to have a dining experience that is vegetarian friendly and where you leave full afterwards! Thanks melting pot for a wonderful date night."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, always a good time. Food is good and wait staff is too. The price is what really gets me. $236 for 6 people, that should at least include free drinks, right? Wrong, still paid for them. 

Because of the extremely high cost, its not a place we can go to often by any means."}
{"text":"A nice date night. Thank you living social.  This was my 1st time eating here. 

Food and service was good overall.  I wish the seating was a little more private. Booth seating with people all around is not exactly quaint.  I would go back with another Living Social deal, but would not go and pay full price."}
{"text":"So, I came here with a voucher for a 3-course meal for 2 plus a champagne toast which was a good deal, but about all I'd pay for the food we got. If you don't have the living social voucher, I'd spend your money elsewhere.

The quality of the food is just OK. Besides the meat, which was delicious, but served in very small portions, it was substandard, especially for the price. (our total would have been over $100 if we didn't have that voucher).

It might just be because I'm allergic to wheat, shrimp and apples, but I couldn't eat half the things they brought us.

Also, when our main course came out, with raw meat just sitting there, our waiter said he'd be right back with the cooking times ... he brought them crudely scribbled on what looked like a used napkin which I thought was kind of unprofessional of the restaurant.

Finally, at the end of our meal, the manager came over and asked if we wanted to donate $10 to St. Jude's children's hospital and we'd get a $20 gift card. I thought, heck why not? It's basically getting $10 for free. So, I did the donation..... but when I received the card, I realized it wasn't a gift card at all - it was a $20 off coupon for spending $50 next time at The Melting Pot. I definitely felt  misled.

Overall, subpar. 3 stars is pretty generous ... I'll give it to them for ambience and because my boyfriend loved it."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour yesterday after reading some reviews.  With only 15 seats for happy hour, we thought we'd have to get there early, but NO ONE WAS THERE.  The bar tender said it RARELY fills up!  Shocker!  With good drink deals ($5 martinis, $6 wines, and good beer deals) as well as $4 fondue for cheese or chocolate, this really is a great first date place.  yes, the date would have to be early, but you could easily catch a movie afterward"}
{"text":"The Melting Pot is not just a restaurant, it's a dining experience. Expect it to take 2-3 hours, so make sure you enjoy your company!

My husband took me here for Valentines day (my review is belated) and it was nothing short of amazing. The service was friendly, but not annoyingly so, and it felt really private and relaxing. The food was delicious and plentiful. I can't imagine how someone could think otherwise honestly. It's a 4 course meal. We had PLENTY of food left over and we were stuffed. 

I would highly recommend this place for a night out with your SO, a double date, a girls night, or anything else slightly festive. Dinner after work with the family? Not so much."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came for our one year anniversary and boy was I surprised! I've always wanted to come to the Melting Pot but I never had a reason to spend so much money on Fondue!

When we got to the restaurant we were quickly seated in this secluded booth that was tucked away in the wall, then they closed a curtain in front of our booth and it was completely private! I thought that was so much fun!

Our servers name was Dan and he was great, very attentive and he walked us through the menu, (which was a little overwhelming), and made helpful suggestions.

We ended up doing the four course meal which came to like $90 dollars and it was SO GOOD. We started with what Dan suggested, the Spinach and Artichoke cheese dip which was served with granny smith apples, various breads and veggies. Dan made it right at our table which was great too!  When we took our first bite we were both immediately \"wowed\".  Then after that we both got our own house salad, the house dressing was great. When our main course came we chose our broth to cook our meat in and the meat we got was lobster tail, shrimp, pork, buffalo chicken, mushrooms in noodles (dumpling like) and beef. They were served with various sauces which I liked. Then last but not least, desert! YUM!! We decided on Bananas Foster and omg so great! The pound cake and brownies it came with was so good. I may have to come back just to get some more desert at some point! lol. 

We ended up spending close to 2 hours here and it was really a wonderful romantic night! I loved the atmosphere and how our server cooked our food right in front of us. I look forward to coming back here in the future!"}
{"text":"Choc-a-holics Unite!!  

(Always wanted to say that, hee-hee!)

But seriously, if you love chocolate like I do, then the Melting Pot is perfect For you!

MP is famous for it's fondue style dinners but for me the star of the show is their desserts! Give me melted chocolate and strawberries and it's ALL GOOD! No seriously....this is my numero uno place for dessert! But I'll get back to that in a moment...

Dinner there is more like an experience...first and foremost it will take you at least an hour and a half (depending upon when and what time you go) to get through a typical 4 course dinner (cheese fondue appetizer, salad, main course fondue and of course, dessert). You don't have to have 4 courses but if you're looking to be full going for the full courses will take care of that! (I recommend the fiesta cheese fondue that is custom blended at your table for the appetizer...it's served with blocks of light and dark breads, chucks of cauliflower and carrots and apple slices, YUM!) The main course is chunks of your choice of meats and fish accompanied by several different dipping sauces to try after they are cooked according to your likeness in either hot broth or oil (again your choice of cooking styles)

NOW ON TO DESSERT!

My fav has got to be the Flaming Turtle..Sounds a Lil suspect I know...but trust me it is fabulous! It's basically milk chocolate, caramel, pecans and a shot of 151 (don't worry its more for show and gets burned off as they light it into the mixture) all melted together to form a little pot of melty chocolate heaven! With this you get strawberries, bananas, pineapples, crushed coconut and Oreo covered marshmallows, chewy fudge brownie bites, and even a Lil slice of cheesecake to dip into your chocolate creation! MY OH MY...every time I get to this part I feel like I'm having an org......OK never mind....let's just say it's over the top DELISH!  ;)

My only caveat here at this location is the service is hit or miss... granted the servers here have a lot on their plates and probably do much more than the average but I'm sure the tips are making up for this....my last visit a few weeks ago with my hubs for our anniversary was a perfect example...GREAT food...service (and they knew we were celebrating something) was under par (dude was from like Jersey /NY/Boston or something and had that \"ttude..). The hostesses here need an attitude adjustment...all of them...so don't get too put off by them before you get to sit down and experience the fondue....I would give this plae a 4 star because of the bad attitudes that come out of the hostesses on a consistant basis but the dessert is so good it trumps them!

TIP: Call and make a reservation in advance and request a booth with the curtains...it's a little more private and makes you feel like your a Lil more exclusive!  ;D"}
{"text":"This trip to the Melting Pot was an adventure into the unknown. Went with my bf, and a friend, for a bday celebration. None of us had ever been to the MP, or any fondue place for that matter. We weren't sure what to expect. It was a Friday night, didn't look too busy, but we still had to wait 30 minutes longer than our reservation for a table.  We chose a four-course meal, and it's amazing how small bites could be so rich and filling. I only took away one star for having to wait for half an hour for our reservation. Otherwise, good food and fun experience to go with friends."}
{"text":"This was our first time going here for dinner. It was such a fun experience. We brought our 5 year old and he loved getting to cook his own food. Savannah was our waitress and she was so patient with us newbies. She answered all my questions and explained things very thoroughly. She was also very kind and friendly. Couldn't even tell that she was still training. I was also impressed by her interaction with our son. When we were leaving the guy at the front asked us to hold on and gave our son an apron and chefs hat. He absolutely loved it. That was so kind. We had a one of a kind experience at this location. The only downfall were the prices. I did not expect it to be so expensive. While, due to prices, we won't be frequenting, we definitely will be back to this location."}
{"text":"We go all the time the service is always great. It is a bit pricey but well worth it for a special occasion. We recently went for my daughters birthday and they made her feel very special. She loved and was so excited. Thank you Melting pot for such great service and knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I like to come here now just for the dessert.  He's not into paying to cook his own food so the allure of the meal packages doesn't work on him.  But, dessert we will both do, and the Melting Pot is one of our favorite places to do so.

I love the variety that you get with the dessert fondue: cheesecake, pound cake, brownies, cream puffs, strawberries, bananas, multiple types of marshmallows, and pineapples are all cut up into mini pieces perfect for feeding each other behind the closed curtain.  We always choose the turtle (chocolate and caramel with pecan nuts), and request the dark chocolate instead of the milk chocolate for those extra antioxidants.  

We recently came to the one on Ray Rd for our Anniversary on New Year's and I was especially pleased with the service.  The waiter not only recommended the correct size we would need for the two of us without trying to upsell us and leave us with way too many leftovers, but he also brought us extra pieces of our favorite \"bites\" when we had finished to make sure we were happy and the extra chocolate didn't go to waste. 

I really appreciated the great service and the great food, and for that I say Thank You Melting Pot!"}
{"text":"I really don't know where to start..........IT WAS NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE AT ALL
The food was totally mediocre to say the least \"WHAT THERE WAS OF IT\"  There was 4 of us and the serving of ALL the items (especially the condiments) was ridiculous.  For 4 people and in all the condiment dishes \"I 'M NOT KIDDING\" THERE
WAS 1/4 tsp in each you couldn't even smear it on to use.......ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.

Our waiter \"David Blane\"look alike' was very rushed........took away items we were not even finished with.  There never was enough cheese to share, or chocolate for the dessert for that matter.
OH YES CHOCOLATE....IT WAS HERSHEY SYRUP served cold and by the time it warmed up........we were done or it was gone???

THIS FOR  A AVERAGE OF $55 PER PERSON..........NO BEVERAGES INCLUDED so
outside of thinking of  a nice way to phrase this...........NOT GOING BACK - EVER -
PISSED OFF for being taken advantage of AND IT WAS A BIRTHDAY TREAT !!!
So much for that GREAT EXPERIENCE \"THAT'S A BS STATEMENT\" ALSO !!!! If I ever heard of one.

SO words of advice....Don't waste your time and most of all your MONEY !!
BECAUSE YOU WILL AND PLEASE MARK MY WORD YOU WILL BE SORRY !!"}
{"text":"First off my husband and I went to dinner here on a Thursday night. When we entered there was an awkward wait for a table.  One employee left to check on something, while the other three stood there cheating with each other. As we were finally seated, we noticed the place was not busy wondering why the wait to be seated.

The gentlemen who sat us fumbled with the three different menus. Again a little odd. Our waitress came and talked us through the menu. After our order, our waitress was hardly seen.  There we long waits between each course.  We would have rather gotten our food more quickly.  The gentlemen who dropped off the broth pot was awkward too and didn't way hi or anything to us. It was just as bad when he picked up the pot.

Food was mediocre, it lacked flavor even with the dipping sauces.  The best part of the meal was the dessert, it is hard to mess up chocolate.  

During our meal a gentlemen who looked like the manager walked by twice. Not once did he check in with us to see how we are doing.  

At the end of the night it too a long time to get our check.  At least I was able to get the check in offer - a bottle of the garlic and wine seasoning. Which is pretty good, just wish they would have incorporated it into the food instead of using it as a \"salt\"."}
{"text":"First things first: the food was delicious. Absolutely no complaints there (unless you count \"wanting a dozen more brownie pieces in my MOUTH\" as a complaint). The prices during Happy Hour are awesome, so if you're worried about cost.. definitely check out their HH. We went on Wednesday evening around 5:30 and there was only one other couple at the bar. 

We each only had one drink, but they were stroonnnggg, which is pretty awesome considering they were only like 5 bucks. 

The only complaint I have is the customer service I received. Angie was our bartender, and wasn't friendly in the least. She started out about average, but by the time we left, she was literally SLAMMING things around... I guess hinting at us that we were taking too long? We were unwinding, relaxing from a hard day's work, and weren't in any hurry. She told us that Happy Hour ended a few minutes ago (it was about 6:10 at this point), and that \"any other employee\" would be charging us full price from this point on instead of HH prices. We told her we were more than happy to pay full price. This didn't seem to make her any happier. She was so frustrated that she actually ended up dropping and breaking a few glasses while drying them off.

Overall, I would visit The Melting Pot again, but I'd steer clear of this waitress because she definitely ruined the experience. When I have a bad day at work, I like to relax.. ya know, chill out... I don't want to deal with a pissy bartender!!"}
{"text":"Our very presence in their lobby was an inconvenience to them. The manager was extremely rude when we asked for a table w out a reservation. No offer to wait just a blunt 45 min wait along with a snarky comment as we left \"do not take any more people with out a reservation\". Thanks for the rude interaction were headed to Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"I would defintley come back for the desert but the rest of the meal was so-so and definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"This is my husbands and my favorite place to eat! The staff is always super nice and friendly and willing to move us if we needed a two burner table or something like that.  The food is delicious!! It's a long meal...we are usually there define about 2 hours.  LOVE THIS PLACE!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I go here every year for our anniversary. We love how quiet and intimate this place is. The service and food is always great!"}
{"text":"So where to start. This was our first time to a melting pot. I've heard great things but quite frankly left disappointed. 

I brought my wife here for our wedding anniversary on 12/30 @8:30pm. We were seated promptly. We sat down and ordered. The fondu and food was good, and our server seemed attentive. 

I was kind of off put by the constant stops at our table. Everyone was nice- but we were asked to leave a review, and then asked if we wanted our picture posted on FB. I honestly just wanted to alone time with my wife. 

After we finished our food our waitress was no where to be found. We waited almost 10 minutes and then she finally came and took our dessert order. We were like okay-  no biggy. We are lenient with people in the hospitality industry and figured she was busy. (However, It was 10pm- and we were one of the only two groups left at the restaurant.) 

Here's where things slightly went down hill. 

While waiting for our dessert there we other servers cleaning up a few feet away from our table. All of a sudden one server yells:

\"I don't care whatever you guys say, this fuckin song is awesome.\" 

It was some song by Alanis Morissette or something. I was like, haha okay- whatever. This guy has a sense of humor. 

Then he yells:

\"Hey do you have any Murphy's oil? I need it because uh- I use it on my BOOBS and my ASSHOLE.\"

This was completely unprofessional and immediately regretted coming here for dinner. I felt that I was at Chili's or some low budget diner. When you spend over a $100 bucks dinner- the least you deserve is a decent atmosphere. 

Go spend your special occasion somewhere else. This place doesn't deserve your business. 

We will never be back.

Correction: The song the server was referring to was \"Unwritten\" by Natasha Bedingfield."}
{"text":"I really do not get all of the hype.  The overall meal was okay.  Smalll portion and very pricey.  The dessert was pretty good but not worth the overall cost of the bill.  My recommendation is to go for dessert only."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try something different for Valentine's Day, so went here last night. Wow what a mistake. First of all we had a reservations and waited an extra 20 min just to be seated. After being seated at one of their private booths (not a good idea if you are claustrophobic), I put my hand into something gross and sticky on the seat.  I couldn't help but notice the old decor,  the place looks like it's falling apart, and it has a funny smell. The cheese fondue was ok.... The girl took it away while I was still working on it, and replaced it with the meat plate. The shrimp tasted like it had freezer burn on it and was definitely not fresh. I ate a few of the scallops and was just hoping I wouldn't  get food poisoning. The desert plate was decent. It had some cheesecake that seemed like it was sitting outside for a while and one of the strawberries had gone bad. I'd normally not say anything but if we are paying 99 per person with a tip of 40 put on their by them.... I'm going to say something! Our bill came out to 250, and it awesome because they do have a spot for an additional tip if you'd like .  I wish we had gone to a nice steak house instead of this.... Trust me it's not worth it and you'll leave hungry!  Btw Marie is really great and responding to bad reviews, yet she does absolutely nothing to fix the problem! We saw a lot of people there that felt the same way we did!"}
{"text":"As a member of Club Fondue, I took advantage of their free cheese fondue offer they were running this week. Score! The location that I usually go to in Scottsdale was booked, so I made a reservation for the Phoenix location. I arrived a few minutes before my reservation and the hostess let me know that the table wouldn't quite be available at 7:30, which was fine because my date was running super late. She offered me a seat at the bar but I just hung out and was seated not too long after arriving. 

The decor of the place is different from the Scottsdale local. A bit more Southwestern and warm in my opinion. I was seated at the booth for about 10 minutes, still waiting for my date, but our server Cory came by and got my drink order and dropped off the menus. Once my date arrived, we decided to get the Big Night Out cheese fondue, which was REALLY good. We skipped over the other courses and got the Big Night Out chocolate fondue, which was dark and milk chocolate, peanut butter, and berries. It was really good. 

TMP is definitely a special-occasion place in my opinion, unless I'm taking advantage of one of their special offers they have every once in awhile. And it makes an impressive dessert date"}
{"text":"A great deal more happened since my last review and you can see I did up it by one star.
After my last review an employee from The Melting Pot decided to privately contact me and was rude towards myself and my review as well as made some snide remarks towards myself and my boyfriend. This really upset me so I contacted The Melting Pot's management and worked with the Area Manager, Kelly Cooper. Kelly was extremely helpful, and offered us a free dinner for the trouble we went through. 

Last night we took up the offer and arrived on time for our reservation. I requested for a table in the main dinning area, rather than one of the private booths. I never considered myself someone uncomfortable in small spaces but I really didn't like the private booths the last time we were there. The booth and area seemed very clean and much more comfortable this time around.
Our server was extremely personable and courteous the entire evening. Everything came out promptly and we were able to dine just under the two hour mark. I've seen others complain about how long it takes to dine here but that's really just part of the experience. Plus my boyfriend and I can sit and talk for hours so we were fine with it.

The food was...okay. We had the spinach artichoke dip, which honestly was bland. We LOVE spinach artichoke dips and this was the worst one we've experienced. It lacked flavor; it needed more spices or even some kick with jalapenos. We had the Coq Au Vin broth for the entree and again it didn't really give the food much flavor at all. Our meal wasn't awful but it wasn't amazing either. As stated in my previous review I've been to The Melting Pot before and remembered how my entire family felt the food didn't match the large price you paid. I still feel the same, I dont think the food has really improved and maybe its because you're cooking it yourself. For example, we really love beef at medium rare, which you can't really do here especially since you're mixing meats and everything needs to be cooked all the way through. We love veggies steamed or roasted and well seasoned but that's not how its cooked. Without the different dipping sauces the food tastes pretty plain. It's just boiled meats and veggies, and after the boiling process the meats come out over cooked for our taste, and the veggies just seemed so boring. Also one thing I noticed, the mushrooms weren't washed; they still had that dark soil-dirt all over them. So for each one I was trying to brush off the dirt before putting them in the broth.
For our dessert we chose the s'more chocolate and opted to take out the brownies, cheesecake, and marshmallows, and had them add extra of everything else. Those three treats are just way too sweet to be dipped in chocolate; the sweet chocolate is more balanced by less sweet items like the fruit, pound cake, and surprisingly, the rice krispies treats.

We had a good enough time, so why is there still a low star rating? Well just under an hour after we left we both became extremely ill. I'm not exactly sure why because we followed our servers instructions by letting the meats boil for at least 2 minutes and sometimes our pieces ended up boiling longer while we had some of the veggies. Also, we didn't touch any of the raw meats to our plates either. So, we spent all last night in and out of the bathroom. Not exactly how we wanted to spend our Friday night. After some light research on Google I did find quite a few reviews on other sites, blog posts, and forum comments about people getting food poisoning from The Melting Pot.

So needless to say, this will be our last visit. After the previous bad experiences, having employees angrily contacting me, and now food poisoning we're not planning on going back. The only reason I upped the star rating is because the manager, Kelly, was so understanding with my complaints and took my concerns seriously."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time and it was amazing!!!! The food was absolutely delicious, the ambiance romantic and the experience fantastic! I will definitely come here again and again!"}
{"text":"I have always loved the melting pot, I have been to the Portland, OR and a Seattle, WA locations and have had awesome experiences. Not at this place! I went there for happy hour today, other than my sister and I, there were only 4 other people at the bar and we still got terrible service. The bartender was unfriendly and too busy hanging out with her friends in the corner, talking about their DUI's, so professional. We had planned on staying there for a while, trying the fondue and have some drinks, but because of the service, we left as soon as we could. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Hmm.. I am surprised at the amount of 2 stars with fellow reviewers. Seems sketchy to me.

Here is the deal with Good Fondue:

Not for a family. Yeah, its a romantic type place. Take a date. Or your wife for gods sake. (She likes to go out too!)

Expensive: Yes, in this day and age, good food can still be expensive. Its worth it people. The time it takes to eat an entire meal here is why it costs so much. You take up 2+ hours of their time for 2 to 4 people to eat. They just can't turn tables like your everyday meal type restaurant.

These meals are meant to be savored. Enjoyed with a good glass of wine, or beverage of your choice. Try to relax here. Enjoy the food, and company most importantly. 

The menu changes a bit from time to time to include a new set of dishes, guessing every 6-8 months. I miss the salad that had heart of palm in it! It was fantastic.

There is enough variety to actually satisfy 2 different peoples desires in most of their entrees.

Desert, as noted by most everyone on here, is to die for. I have not had one bad desert yet.

The quick and easy guide to The Melting Pot: Coq au Vin is the baseline cooking that most will love. Traditional Swiss cheese is where \"IT\" is at. Featured salad is usually a good bet. California salad is a good standby. 

Deserts: Try them ALL! Seriously..."}
{"text":"Arrived at 6:55 for 7pm reservation. No host, no one to greet,.... waited more than 10 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge our presence at the restaurant. Walked to bar etc and nothing. 
No one tending bar. Bare staff. Manager person named Mark eventually walks up to us and says he was busy. Restaurant may have had 3-5 parties. Not busy. If my family hadn't insisted we go here, we would have walked out. For years I have seen that this sight charges a lot for poor service. I did not eat there and never will again. 
I believe in people putting in hard work for their station. This restaurant should close."}
{"text":"We recently visited the Melting Pot. The food was good. Our whole table thought that the waiter was obnoxious. Every time he came to the table he would try and push alcoholic drinks on us. We laughed it off however I told him that one of us was a recovering alcoholic and he was making it very difficult to say no. He did not stop and kept asking if we would like more alcohol even after we told him one of our party was on medication!!I have never experienced a waiter so pushy. I typically tip 20% however he was so obnoxious that did not happen and in fact I would not go back to that restaurant due to his pushiness and winking and spitting as he spoke at the table. Beyond that his thumb was in our food or on the top of our plate every time he delivered something. It was a real turn off. His name was Zack. So don't get that waiter if you go eat there."}

{"text":"Excellent experience. The server, Tyler, was fantastic. Helped when needed, very knowledgeable, and was at the table an appropriate amount of time and allowed us to enjoy our meal. Fairly pricey, but for a special occasion it was perfect. My husband felt the decor at this location could use an update."}
{"text":"I wish that I could give The Melting Pot more than 5 stars because they made our company holiday party stress free and absolutely perfect!!

I have put together a number of company parties and they are always stressful and something horrific normally goes on. Tracy (rest manager) made the entire process a breeze, from start to finish. She even let me taste test the wines we were serving. That was a fun afternoon ;-)

The food was amazing, as usual, and the service was outstanding. I would highly recommend the spinach artichoke cheese fondue and the yin and yang chocolate fondue! Amazing!!!!

I would highly recommend The Melting Pot to anyone looking to host a holiday party or really any type of party for that matter. It is also a really intimate and romantic place to take someone on a date."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. Our server Jeremy was beyond amazing and helpful. Our food was over the top amazing. We had the four course meal and every course was delicious. The cheese was a great start and I loved the apples. Cesar salads had great flavor. We ordered the classic meal for dinner which had a great variety and tastey sauces for us to dip out meats in. Dessert......OMG!!!!! Words cannot describe how good it was. We will be back. I give this place top ratings!!!"}

{"text":"We ate here this Saturday night, August 31 using a DealChicken voucher that we had purchased for $99.

The voucher was for a 4-course menu of endless fondue, including a cheese fondue to start, 4 sales, an endless fondue entree, chocolate fondue for dessert, plus a bottle of wine. This was supposedly a $200 retail value. In addition, a 20% gratuity, placed on the full value of the meal, before tax, was to be added.

While the service was fine, and I really don't have too many complaints regarding the food, this was the first time I've ever been mislead by a restaurant when purchasing a voucher. The actual retail value, according to their menu, was $168.80, not $200. This included 4 endless fondue entrees at $36.95 each, plus a $21 bottle of wine.

While I understand that restaurants take a fraction of their regular margins when accepting a voucher from DealChicken, Groupon, Living Social, etc., it's a marketing decision they have decided to make to hopefully attract new customers. I was very disappointed to find out that this Melton Pot location had inflated their base prices before selling the voucher, and included a mandatory gratuity based on that same inflated value.

While I have no issue tipping 20% for great service, I prefer to tip on the actual value of the meal... not an overstated number.

While the food was okay, I can't in good heart return to a restaurant that nickels and dimes its customers. This was very disappointing and I expected better from a national chain."}
{"text":"My quick summary:  Perfect for splurging on a romantic evening.

My fiance took me here last night for an overdue romantic evening together.  I had never been to The Melting Pot before because I didn't understand paying so much to cook most of your own food.  But if my sweetie is paying...  Well sure, why not?  :P

I was immediately impressed.  The hostess seated us immediately, took a complimentary picture for us and our waitress arrived to take our drink orders right away.  Their blackberry sage lemonade may just be my new favorite drink.  My fiance had a margarita, the waitress recommended it because she was also this evening's bartender and makes a mean Margarita. Well, she was right.  And our service was never lacking.  Quite a feat to bar tend and serve us all at the same time.  She also knew what changes had to be made to all the courses we ordered for my gluten free dietary needs, they're very well trained there.

The tables are small, intimate, and closed in by a curtain.  There is a small burner at the back of the table for the fondue pots to be heated up on.  The booths were quite comfortable.  And the low lighting certainly creates a romantic feeling.

The first course was a gluten free beer and cheese fondue with scallions on top.  They brought us bowls on fresh veggies (broccoli, cauliflower and carrots) and bowls of crisp Granny Smith apple slices.  I'd never eaten fondue and had no idea what to expect.  But the flavors were amazing.  It was creamy, cheesy goodness that was paired very well with the vegetable and fruit flavors.

The second course was a Wisconsin wedge salad.  This course was OK, but not my favorite.  It wasn't bad, but it's really just a partial head of iceberg, ranch, bacon and a flavorful cheese on the side.  This is just my prejudice.  I don't like only iceberg in salads.  It's bland and holds almost no nutritional value.

Our third course was the main meat course.  We got extra shrimp (had to substitute out some pasta), pork tenderloin, buffalo chicken, slices of beef, and more veggies.  They bring you sectioned plates for all the dipping sauces, a plum based one that's like a sweet & sour, a yogurt curry one, a creamy cheese one good with Buffalo chicken, and a creamy veggie dip.  They told us exactly how long to cook each meat so it gets cooked perfectly.  It was all seasoned perfectly with a small amount of heat.  Everything was quite flavorful.

Our dessert course was the S'mores chocolate & marshmallows, minus the graham cracker crumbles.  They were even kind enough to bring my fiance a small plate of rice crispy treats because those aren't certified gluten free, but he loves them.  And we shared a plate of large strawberry slices, pineapple, marshmallows, and banana slices.  One word: divine.  The chocolate was rich, creamy, and addicting, with a hint of marshmallow.  Their dessert is the perfect end to a romantic meal.

I've heard a lot of people complain about the price, but I think it is really a fair deal.  Now, hear me out before you throw rotten produce at me.  A full meal here takes at least an hour and a half, probably more like 2 hours, or more depending on this size of your party.  It does not have the quick turnover the vast majority of restaurants have.  And it's really about paying for the experience.  It's fun, romantic, and if you've never had fondue, a learning experience.

I think this will easily become my go-to romantic date night location...  However few and far between they may be."}

{"text":"This was the worst dining experience of my life. After arriving with a modest group of four, we explained that this was our first time. Standardly that means a brief explanation and assistance through the menu. We got none of that. We were left alone for 15 minutes after ordering water, and then again for 30 after we stated we weren't ready. When the waiter finally came back, he breezed over the explanation and then again left for 30 minutes before a different waiter came finally came to take our order after explaining that our previous waiter had gotten caught up at the bar. I understand getting busy, but a little courtesy to tell is why there was a delay isn't too huge a task to ask. Especially when my small group had come in well before there was any kind of rush in the restaurant and absolutely no one at the bar. The ordeal wasn't over yet. The initial fondue came out in a relatively quick manner, and it was okay- definitely not anything to warrant 10 dollars per serving. After that was done we sat for almost two hours, with many parties coming in and getting served before we even saw our waiter come back. We had now spent three hours in the restaurant with no entree in sight. We did not stick around. For the price of $40 or more per person for the \"full experience\" I would have expected some actual experience. This was the most pathetic show of quality and service I have ever had the misfortune of enduring. When the IHOP down the street has better food and better service, you know a supposedly classy place like this is a waste of time."}
{"text":"I went to happy hour this evening with two girlfriends. This may be one of the best happy hours in Ahwatukee. $3 Beer, $5 Wine & $6 Cocktails  +  fondue and appetizer specials. We had the wisconson trio, a yummy blue cheese fontina concoction, which was served with  bread, apples and vegies.  For dessert,  we shared the dark chocolate fondue w/ extra strawberries. It was delish!  The only thing that would have made this better was if the bar was packed. We were the only peeps there.  I hope the happy hour word spreads because happy hour is best in large groups of happy people."}
{"text":"I worked at this Melting Pot many, many moons ago. It was a lot better back then (or maybe my lack of fine dining exposure then made it seem so). I wouldn't call the Pot 'fine dining' but you are still spending $100 minimum as a couple so some standards are expected. 

They had crammed all the guests into one quarter of the restaurant. We had a nice ambiance of other tables conversations, crying children, and phone timers going off. The lights were insanely bright, the servers are wearing jeans, and the music was loud 'top hits' type of stuff. I thought we had walked into the wrong restaurant. 

Our waiter was Zach. He was really, really casual. Like, leaning up against the wall to talk and repeatedly calling my boyfriend \"boss\". Um... ok... weird. 

None of the waitstaff sounded like they had any training in serving beyond maybe Chili's quality places. For example, we were all trained to take the ladies' orders firsts, etc. and to never assume who is paying the bill. Apparently this isn't taught at the Pot anymore. 

Prices on cheese and chocolate have gone up a fair bit. The only good bit is that they have added extra dippers with the cheese - cold cut meats and such. As if to balance it out, they removed the cheesecake from the chocolate platter. Sigh.

I may not be remembering correctly but it also seemed the entree plate we got was really lacking in terms of meat. I thought \"That's it?\" when it came out and was glad I hadn't dropped $48 for my own plate. 

Overall this was a really underwhelming experience. I can think of a dozen other restaurants you would be better off spending your anniversary/birthday/etc at."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, but service and management just killed it! 

Me and my boyfriend walked in for a nice night out on a Tuesday after work to relax and grab some wine and good eats. Shortly after arriving was the first issue, we requested a private booth (which were mostly all open). The manager immediately treated us like children, as if a private booth was 'too much' for us, and recommended the dining room; We happily declined and pushed for a private booth... (which we shouldn't have to when the restaurant is that empty). 

Sitting down we were approached by 3 people about taking our wine glasses away, yet again we declined all 3 efforts. We are both over the age of 21 and we're expecting to order wine. 

After some thought, I decided against it because I had drank the night before and it wasn't necessary for me, plus I had realized I left my ID at the bar I went to so I figured I couldn't order anyways. My significant other still decided to ordered himself a drink to relax with. 

The very pompous server immediately went over to order the drink and came back very quickly to ask me for my ID. Apparently the manager had told her that he can't serve my boyfriend an alcoholic beverage because I didn't have my ID...? Oh I'm sorry I didn't know that for someone else to order a drink, the whole table needs their ID. 

Actually, that's definitely not a law and that is definitely illegal!! Honestly the amount of hassle it was for him to get any kind of drink was out of this world. Me and him both work in the industry in old town Scottsdale and we would NEVER treat a table like this. There are TONS of age people who choose not to drink on a daily basis and discriminating against them for the way they look is not the way to get a good tip or good review! The manager also posed the fact that he used to work on mill to us and there was always underage people trying to drink. Okay? Like that matters to me? I'm of age and I'm choosing NOT to drink, that shouldn't be an issue and you shouldn't interrogate me about it or discrimInate against me for any way I look. The bill was 160 and we happily left 0, felt bad for the server but the manager completely did in for her. Maybe next time don't discriminate against people you don't know, you never know who you work with."}
{"text":"Super friendly service. CJ is amazing. Can't even believe someone his age is that polite and really cares about service. He was humorous and conversational and everything was brought out in perfect timing sequence. Food was great the sausage was spicy and amazing and of course you can't beat the dessert!  Wonderful evening for our 20th anniversary!"}
{"text":"The service was wonderful! This was our first time trying the melting pot, and we couldn't have had a better experience."}
{"text":"I came here once and felt that it wasn't worth a second trip. Then some friends invited me for a happy hour and I decided, what the hell I guess I'll try it twice. Little did we know, their happy hour changed and now ends at 6.  I've waited over 20+ for my very simple house salad now and had to remind the waitress who didn't seem to remember it was coming. Server also said she would bring one more water which she forgot and I've been waiting for that for 1/2 hour too. Just got my salad and it's pathetic for $8. I literally hate this place. There are a million better places with amazing food for a bunch better price and with better service."}
{"text":"What a sub-par dining experience! I bought my husband a $100 gift card to the Melting Pot for his last birthday; we love fondue and make it frequently at home, but it's always a lot of work, and I thought it would be fun to sit back and let someone else stir the pot, if you will. Well, 2 valuable Friday-night hours and $150 (including the gift card) later, I wished we had stayed at home and created shredded mountains of Gruyere and Fontina ourselves. We selected the \"Perfect Night Out\" (ha!) menu, which allowed you to choose a cheese fondue, a salad, types of meat, style of broth fondue (for cooking the meat) and a dessert fondue. We both had dirty martinis with Absolut, which were $8.50 - so overpriced. We could have gotten Gray Goose martinis for that price elsewhere. 

Anyway, the cheese fondue fixings arrived, and our server (who was really, really nice and pretty much the only good thing about our dining experience) threw them all in the pot, gave them a quick stir, and Voila!, the worst fondue ever was born. It tasted like melted cheddar, and that's it! There was no complexity or richness at all. The bread cubes for dipping were stale, the mixed veggies just contained cauliflower and baby carrots. The Granny Smith apples were decent, but we finished the first course totally unimpressed (and already staring at our watches!). Next up were the salads. They may have been the worst salads we've ever had. The mushroom spinach salad was drenched in jaw-numbingly sweet dressing, and the Caesar salad dressing was sweet too (?!).  

At this point, the meat course arrived, and our server mixed up the \"Coq Au Vin\" broth (this was an $8 upgrade from the regular bouillon broth), dumping an entire carafe of burgundy wine into the fondue pot. After we began eating this course, my husband correctly pointed out that that was wine we could have drunk instead of sending to a flavorless fate in that pot, and I wholeheartedly agree. The meat was either really overseasoned or underseasoned - as an example, the sirloin cubes were coated in stale, dry herbs, but the chicken, which was supposed to have a vanilla essence, tasted just like dr y chicken. To be fair, the shrimp and lobster tail were decent, but I would have rather gone to Red Lobster and had a lifetime supply of shrimp and lobster tail for much less than we paid for this meal. The dipping sauces that came with this course were also confusing - there were like 8 of them, and except for the melted herb butter, they all tasted totally unappealing. The teriyaki glaze and sweet and sour were the worst - they reminded me of sauces that come on a Yoshinoya rice bowl. 

Whew, ok, so at this point, we were ready to just get the check and leave before dessert. I am glad that we decided to stick around, since the dessert was the only good part of the meal. We ordered the dark chocolate and Disaronno Amaretto fondue, and we really enjoyed the bananas, rice krispie treats, and strawberries coated with the perfectly melted sauce. The coated marshmellows were strange, though, and we left them on the plate. Based on the taste, quality, and value of this food, I wanted to give this place one star. The incredibly attentive service (don't kill the messenger or, in this case, the deliverer, right?) and dessert made me throw a star back on. If you have $150 to blow, you could have a great meal at Durant's or Elements (or a FEAST at tons of other places); why spend it on an over-hyped and flavorless Melting Pot dinner?"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time last night and it was delicious.  Service was a little slow, but the server was very friendly and knowledgeable. We had the Big Night Out Fondue Fusion, and the Snickers chocolate fondue. We left very full and quite happy."}
{"text":"I hadnt been there in years, and it was all I remembered.  I went with a coupon that I go purchased on the Living social website.  Champagne toast, appertizer, salad and all you can eat entree.  They also do a complimentary photo for you.  Very quaint and romantic.  But the food was fantastic.  We had the cheese fondue that was just delicous.  The meat course was also wonderful.  But the thing that really made our experience great, was waiter.  He was great, and funny and he was there when you needed him.

But I do not suggest turning up there without a reservation.  You can make reservations online, very quick and easy and you get a confirmation."}
{"text":"So a wonderful start for Mother's Day .
I got to make some mother days strawberries with my family with the company of the manger Mark he's very friendly and helpful . I'm looking forward to celebrating my graduation dinner here with family and friends . They have wonderful tasting food and excellent service !"}
{"text":"I went to The Melting Pot for the first time last night with a group of my friends and I wasn't super impressed. The service wasn't the best...one of the servers dropped a tray of water on my friend and although they apologized it wasn't handled well. I would expect a manager to come over, apologize and comp something off of my friends bill given the fact her dress was wet for the remainder of the dinner. I think our server could have explained the menu and proper cooking time for the food a little better as well. The food was just okay to me...nothing special. I suppose given the price of my meal (approx $50 per person) I was expecting more of a \"wow factor\". If I do ever go back it would just be for the cheese fondue or the dessert...I didn't think the four course meal was worth the money."}
{"text":"Worst! Service is good, \"food scraps\" are too expensive and tasteless.  They also use a bait and switch method in their pricing.  Spend your $100 elsewhere!"}
{"text":"The only problem I have with going to melting pot is that I always eat way too much. We even split an entree this time, but I still ended up full before dessert arrived. We came to this location for our anniversary, and our server Andrew was very sweet and attentive. Food was delicious, atmosphere is older, but cozy and private. Great way to spend an evening with your honey!"}
{"text":"My birthday weekend has been pretty good until today! My loving wife had wanted to make a reservation to our once a year place The Melting Pot in order to celebrate the evening as adults without kids and with our sanity!
  Since it was early in the morning, we decided to use the convenience of the internet and make a reservation online through whatever app that the restaurant commissioned for their loyal customer base. 7:30pm, seating for two...reservation made ! Boom!  Head on out, drive 25 miles one way to get there in time! Walk up to the front and ask about our reservation...Baird, party of two! \"I am so sorry, we don't have that reservation...did you put in this name...are you sure you made that reservation for today???\"  Why would we come all that way and not be certain we made the reservation correctly!  Hostess was not accommodating, advised it would be an hour and a half before we could sit. What a waste of time!
  Never again!"}
{"text":"Melting pot lover for 10+ years here... and I'm sad to say this place is just NOT what it used to be. Portions are smaller, service is mediocre at best, and you are guaranteed to pay over $100 to boil your own meat."}
{"text":"Normally I would give Melting Pot a 5 star but our dinner tonight was just okay.  Our server was slower then normal.  We know to plan a couple of hours for dining at the Melting Pot...and that is one of the reasons we love it but 3 hours was a bit long. 

I could even live with the three hours but what really got me in the end was the dessert...which if you read the reviews is what they are known for.  After much debate we ordered the Turtle fondue.  After placing the chocolate/caramel  mixture on our table I asked about the pecans...which I was then informed by the server...oh we're out of pecans!  REALLY...that would have been good information when we ordered the Turtle fondue.  Then she charged us $2.00 extra for another cheesecake.  Maybe you should have went ahead and gave us the extra cheesecake since you were out of pecans for our TURTLE chocolate fondue. 

It wasn't our first rodeo at this establishment.  We go every year for our anniversary...I think next year we will find a new spot."}
{"text":"This was one of the most romantic dates I've been on! My boyfriend and I came here for our 3 year anniversary and had such a relaxing evening! The restaurant was kind of empty, but that was fine. I've never had fondue before and this was an awesome experience. The waitress really took good care of us and didn't even judge us when we decided against getting a huge bank breaking meal and just stuck to cheese and chocolate. The food was amazing (still crazy expensive for what you're getting but...I guess they have a reputation to uphold) and I would love to come to this location again."}
{"text":"Couldn't ask for better service
. 
Had an amazing date night. 

CJ was an amazing server and suggested perfect choices for us! The GM came and checked in throughout the meal and ensured everything was going well. 

Love the fact that they take a picture and are more than willing to take pictures for you throughout the night. Definitely adding this to the list for must haves."}
{"text":"First time here 3 weeks ago. A fun experience and the food was all great!  It's a special occasion place or if you have a travelzoo deal..it makes it an affordable visit.  The deal includes app to share, 2 salads, and meats are unlimited but didn't take advantage of that. Lastly includes 2 glasses of wine.  Nice time and I would recommend a cozy booth with curtains. it's perfect for conversation & a relaxing evening."}
{"text":"The place is old and dark. The decor is falling off the walls. The food was passable.  We went for New Years. Each couple ended up forced to pay $28 tips. Each couple!  I don't think we'll be back.  If so it'll only be for the chocolate.  That was amazing!"}
{"text":"Still the best happy hour in town with the best components of fondue, cheese and chocolate, on discount. Mmmm. I could go for some now."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me for our first time here for our anniversary dinner. It was amazing complete with roses, wine and a keepsake framed photo to take home. The food was delicious and the experience and privacy was something we've never experience but loved and will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The boy and I were celebrating our one year anniversary so we decided to try The Melting Pot.  I made reservations through Open Table (Yay!) indicating it was our Anniversary so they would be aware it was a special occasion.  When we arrived we were told it would be a 10 min wait, even though I had made a reservation weeks in advance.  We headed to the bar to get a drink where we were promptly ignored by the bartender who was more concerned about cleaning plates than taking our drink order.  One of the two bartenders asked the other one to grab our order but she too, ignored us during our obligatory 10 min wait.  We went to our table empty handed.

The hostess was sweet but was a bit ditzy and wouldn't make eye contact with us.  She asked if we were celebrating anything special that night and we informed her it was our anniversary.  She asked us \"what kind of anniversary?\"  Ummm?  Our server brought us water but was slow to take our drink order, by this time we had been in the building for 25 min without anything from the bar.  Our server was helpful to navigate the menu and gave us recommendations of what she liked, and how to cook the food.

The table situation was another big miss.  We were seated right next to the server station and were treated to their loud antics the entire night.  Every time someone walked by, which was a lot, they said \"corner\" and later one server broke into a loud rendition of \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\".  We also had several staff ask us if it was a special occasion throughout the night.  I had made a note of it on our Open Table reservation, had told the hostess, so by the time the 4th person asked us, it was beyond awkward.

The hostess came around mid-meal and asked us if we wanted out picture taken with no explanation other than \"would you like your picture taken?\"  Fortunately we over heard her tell another table that they do complimentary pictures that are uploaded to their FB page.  It was a nice touch, but very odd without any explanation.  I do want to give kudos to the bus boy with the man bun who escorted me to the rest room when I asked for directions.

While the food was ok, the service and experience was very lack luster for the final bill amount.  For a special occasion we felt put out and put up with.  On our way out I noticed nice romantic tables that had a curtain to block out the rest of the restaurant that we were not offered to us.  Maybe the \"Somewhere over the rainbow\" song was a special occasion package I wasn't aware of."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here for our second year anniversary and it was really amazing! We had a nice private seating area and the service was very polite and educated us on all the foods and how to pair things together over all a very lovely and romantic evening! They even brought us chocolate covered strawberries and wrote happy anniversary on the plate in chocolate. Would recommend for a special evening out (Would also recommend reservations)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to take your time and enjoy someones company.
The food is fresh and the service always friendly.
If you are looking to be fed fast this is not the place to go.
Fondue is fun!
If you have the time and the money this is a place to have a great evening."}
{"text":"My bosses got me a gift card for my birthday here so the fiancé and I had date night. We started with the prosciutto and asparagus cheese dip. I think the white wine gave it a bitter taste so I didn't really enjoy it much. We ordered the steak lovers entree. The filet mignon was very delicious and probably my favorite. We also got the sausage and salmon which was really good. We finished off with the chocolate s'mores and this was amazing!! 

The concept of the restaurant was pretty cool. Cooking your own food. And you also get your own private booth. It's definitely good for that special occasion. And the customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"This is an experience everyone should have. This was my first time here. Please make a reservation not necessary but it would be recommended. The service was excellent. Being a new experience be aware that you have to cook your main course. It was so much fun. Very filling !  I will be bad for another experience"}
{"text":"Great place for a double date. CJ was a great server. The menu has changed again to a prix fixe style. Think Old Spaghetti Co. manager favorite."}
{"text":"Very expensive, but also very romantic for those \"special nights\".
Food is great, everything is fondue (if you couldn't guess by the name)
Friendly staff, very attentive."}
{"text":"Never usually go to this location but strange circumstances brought us to this spot.  Great place.  My fiancé and I already love the fun way to eat dinner and we especially love the variety of meats you can get on one platter. Such as duck and lobster yum yum. I really want to give this place a 5 star because the manager stopped by and made us feel very welcome. Very nice gentleman just transferred from scottsdale. He was great and so was our server. I wish I could remember her name.  The other servers were also attentive to us so we were never wanting which is always nice.  Favorite thing of coarse was the flaming turtle dessert. To die for. Just wish they had red velvet cake like the last time we went. But still a lovely experience! Thank you."}
{"text":"Make sure you have a reservation if you go on a weekend day. We stopped by a couple of weeks ago hoping to be able to get a table. Unfortunately it was a 4 hour wait. We went ahead and made a reservation for the following weekend.

The ambiance is fantastic. A very romantic private setting with curtains that enclose your booth. The service was great too! I wasn't a fan of the cooking style for the meat.. but it may just be my personal taste. The cheese fondue was my favorite part.

The food was decent but I honestly don't think it was worth the money. I think you are paying for the atmosphere and the uniqueness of the cooking style.

Definitely not a place for kids"}
{"text":"We spent our fifth anniversary here and we loved it! It was my husbands first time here and he was super impressed. Food was excellent. Server was great! General manager came by several times to check in. We will be back."}
{"text":"Perfect for birthdays. The bar happy hour is half off cheese. We love sitting at the bar. This place is classy and the manager is always on the top of his game. Prices are high but it's worth the special occasion. Stay cheesy my friends."}
{"text":"We have been here several times, usually for a special occasion because this place is expensive. Be sure to request the secluded curtained tables... If not, you'll be sitting directly next to another group/party. The general seating area has nothing in the way of privacy. 

The fact that you have to cook your own food in a pot and they don't supply a timer is crazy. My wife and I both had our iPhones on the table timing when our food would be cooked. The wood wall next to the pot was all discolored and burnt. It is clear that not much money has been put back into the look of the place.   The food all comes out raw and must be cooked by you in a pot which is a pain to fish your food out of. Between having to cook all of the food and fishing it out of the pot, the dinners here always last three hours. 

The unlimited dippers for the cheese fondue appetizers and chocolate desserts are my only alternative to leaving starving. 
The entrees consist of 7 or 8 bites of meat.... Yes BITES!!! When they say steak they mean two or three bites worth, but they charge an arm and a leg.

We only go here because my wife requests it. She thinks it's romantic. Lol"}
{"text":"Went last night to celebrate my birthday with 6 other friends and family. First of all, I want to apologize to the other patrons that were sitting near us because after 4 of their WONDERFUL chocolate martinis I probably was pretty loud too.I wasn't wearing a hat though. The food was wonderful as always especially since we started with the dessert and went from there. Jeremy also was our server and he couldn't have been more adorable.After  I got my birthday hug I personally don't think he plays on any other team then the girls.:)) The staff made the whole experience even more enjoyable for me. thank you. thank you thank you to the whole Melting Pot crew"}
{"text":"Great place for date night. Fun experience and great food. CJ is the best, definitely made the experience memorable."}
{"text":"You need to experience this most awesome restaurant. This was our first time here, but will make this a must go to place. What did we order and all of that, ? Way too much, or am I too lazy ? Don't know. But I do know that you will not be disappointed. So make reservations and take your beautiful bride out and enjoy yourselves."}
{"text":"When I get the privilege of \"dinner anywhere I want\" from the hubby, this Melting Pot is at the top of my list!  Sophisticated, intimate, romantic atmosphere and attentive staff.  The cheese and chocolate fondues are delicious and the \"dippables\" are of the highest quality.  The whole experience is decadent and worth every penny.  And yes, bring lots and lots of pennies.  It's expensive."}
{"text":"Service was amazing!!! Our waitress was Stevie and she was so awesome, super nice and knew what she was doing.
I needed everything I ate to be gluten free since I have Celiacs and they were very understanding and accommodating. 
My husband and I went for our birthday week (since both our birthdays are right next to each other). And they even remembered that we don't drink, so they brought us sparkling cider and a birthday plate!
We got there early on a Thursday night, 5:00 and there was NO ONE there. It was a bit odd because the entrance to the place actually looks more like a back or side entrance, and when we walked in, there were no workers up front. So I was a bit worried butt after being greeted by someone a few minutes later they were nothing but kind and competent. 
Food:
Food was really good! I do think it's a bit over priced. Next time we go we will probably just be there for appetizers and desserts. 
The one thing is that the place needs some serious decor updating. It was built in 2000 and it definitely shows. The owners need to put some more love into it.
But over all, once my wallet recovers, we plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"I tussled with the three stars for a moment and ultimately had to stick to my guns. 

First the allure of fondue is amazing and apparently the multiple times I've visited in the past, I was over served because I did not remember this location to be so run down. The awatukee  location has been around a while and it shows. If your lucky enough to get one of those little Nooks tucked away behind the velvet ropes, enjoy; the view from general admission is ehh at best. 

Ultimately I have no \"complaints\" about the food just turns out boiled filet mignon is not my cup of tea, weird huh? In the future I will strictly melting potting for cheese and chocolate fondues. Begging and end of my meal hit all marks, middle not so much. 

Beer cheese fondue was prime, I also got the remainder of my beer to drink while I watched the cheese boil, yuuum! However the salad was wack, to say the least, if I in fact did pay the suggested $7 on the menu I would throw my plate through that pretty velvet curtain any day. Presentation was purely pathetic a salad made up of croutons, limp iceberg and cheese and a poor excuse for a boiled egg was really just offending. 

The middle, the meat and boiling part. Presentation is done well however a few key elements raised red flags. A- boiling prime cuts of beef, I should have been stoned to death at first thought of such a notion. B- the stew or brew that arrives is delivered in this pressure cooking contraption by one person, cool enough right? But it's all packed up by another person in exactly the same manor it arrived. In my lost potato retrieval efforts I noticed that the bottom of the pot was somewhat burnt or crunchy for lack of better terms, are these pots generally reused? Is my pot of boiling stew someone else's? It just struck me as odd that the bottom of the pot was not smooth as I would expect a clean pot to be. Oh well. 

Finished is by far the greatest. Chocolate and dipping goodies, there literally is no wrong in the world after that! Highly recommended. 

Bottom line is that I will likely only be back for appetizers or dessert. 

However, gleaming quality was the cocktails. By far one of the best Moscow mules I have ever had. So much so I made sure to have two, so refreshing and tasty. 

Final TIP: ladies, keep your hair up, our out or whatever, may hair and clothes smelled of what resembled chicken noodle soup till I showered and though I am not a dirty person or overly OCD about grooming; the thought or pure inconvenience of showering ( and washing your hair) before and after a $150 meal is just annoying and little gross. 

Three stars for pure demand I shower immediately to rid my body of boiled meat smell before I could climb into bed, experience 100% altered by the smell effect."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to The Melting Pot in many years, its just not super close to us.  Recently there was a groupon 2 for $37, so we purchased it thinking it would be fun to go since it had been so long.  

We ordered the cheddar cheese fondue for starters.  It was good - served with bread, apples, veggies..  this was followed by the salads.

Next was the entree, we choose teriyaki sirloin, filet mignon and chicken.  There were several cooking styles to pick from- we went with the Mojo, which is a caribbean seasoned bouillon.  It was really delicious, served with different sauces.

We splurged and went with a desert fondue.  We picked the yin yang which was a mix of dark and white chocolate also served with a variety of dippers.  It was soooooo yummy as well!

The fondue experience is what most come for I imagine, so it is nice that it is backed up with good food!  It is expensive- with out the groupon, our bill would have been $150.  That included about $30 of alcohol.

I did a check in on yelp while at the restaurant and received a free bottle of seasoning- fun little surprise, I hadn't seen this before.

Our waiter, Brad, was AWESOME!   Super friendly, always available but not in an annoying way and helpful with suggestions.  Give him a raise :)"}
