{"text":"We have always loved Jason's Deli, but this particular location is too crowded. Tables and chairs and booths are all crammed together making it an uncomfortable eating experience. There is literally no space between the tables in much of the restaurant. Won't visit again."}
{"text":"Solid 4. 

Typically, there is not much on this planet that excites me more than fresh, local, organic ingredients on a sandwich, but when I can have that and a salad bar I am a happy little tree-hugger. 

Jason's is an all-time favorite sandwich place of mine and of my fellow vegan foodie. The portabello wrappini (hold the cheese, please) and the salad bar with their black currant tea are the keys to the good life for lunch and a mid-afternoon craving for a friggin' good sandwich. (And of course, the occasional slide on the vegan diet for a much needed fill of cheese that can only be satisfied by their french onion or tomato basil soup- yummo). 

A few bummers-  the lack of veggie sandwich options ( I think there are only 3 or 4), which is why I pretty much order the same thing every time. But having this in mind, I haven't been displeased going there for my mushroom wrappini. 

This is a good place to take anyone because they have stuff that everyone likes (even pasta for those who don't want a sandwich- in which case you should rush them to the nearest hospital because something ain't right- who goes to a damn deli and doesn't get a sandwich?). 

cheers and happy sandwiching, 
the vegan foodies

{"text":"The location is great! The prices are spot on and the environment is relaxed and comfortable. 

The salad bar is fun and they have a pretty descent variety of offerings.
The soups are always great. The chili which was one of my favorites, the chicken pot pie, the beef stew,and the tortilla chicken. Jasons Deli always hits the spot when you are looking for a quick and healthy meal.

I also LOVE that they have introduced their healthy initiative.. Yay Jason's Deli!! I am a loyal customer!!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are tasty. Usually hastily put together and often wrong if asked for something different to be done to the item. Salad bar has an impressive selection of items available but pretty pricy in my opinion. Restaurant is very clean. Staff is friendly until we pointed out sandwiches were incorrect. They redid them and they were still wrong, didn't say anything the second time, we were on our lunch hour and didn't have time to wait for a third sandwich to be made. This has happened more than once."}
{"text":"We decided to get lunch from here for the first time. The lobster chowder was amazing. Soup was chunky and filled with lobster. The wild salmon-wich was good but might try a different sandwich next time. Definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"First time here and I can honestly say I WILL NEVER BE COMING AGAIN!! 
Jason's deli was horrible ordered 3 items of the menu and disappointed with all 3. My turkey wrap which is a top pick was horrifying. My entire tortilla was hard and cracking apart as I picked it up. The wilted vegetables and over ripped fruit that came with it didn't help. It had no flavored and the sauce didn't help it just over powered. The half sandwich and soup option was no better actually worse. The soup seemed like powered cheese clustered into one ball and the sandwich the best out of everything was literally two bites. My panini was horrible the bread was some hard nasty plain white bread and the sandwich had no flavor. It was dry and flavorless. What a disappointing experience now I know to never come back."}
{"text":"It's a great place to eat but they took my favorite sandwich off the menu and I really  don't like the others and the last time I had the salad bar it was very disappointing  so I haven't been back and I used to go a lot"}
{"text":"This place is always great! The attendants are very friendly and the food is always good! Soups are amazing ! Plus you get free ice cream! Love eating there!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Jason's Deli for years as I love the selection of food, the healthy options, and of course the free soft serve froyo!  
However, I had the most INCREDIBLE experience at the Jason's Deli in the Epicenter over and over this past weekend while my family was visiting Charlotte.
Each and every time we went in (which was a lot, ha ha) we had excellent customer service.  The workers were so genuinely friendly and helpful, you just got a great atmosphere going in there.  It felt like the workers were treated well there and really liked and enjoyed their job.
Gabriel, I believe is either the store manager or a manager, I am not sure.  Talk about going above and beyond!  He is phenomenal!  If any higher ups are reading this review (and I hope you are) the entire store deserves a raise, and Gabriel deserves a promotion.  
I don't normally feel so compelled to write a glowing review, and I am definitely not a plant.  In fact, if Gabriel is reading this, I'm sure he remembers the family from LA with the baby boy and the grandma who came in frequently and always had such a wonderful time."}
{"text":"This is a great soup, salad & sandwich place! They have a rather large venue and they do a good job of keeping majority of the tables clean. The employees were very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.

They have free garlic toasts & bread next to the salad bar. Free soft-serve ice cream!

Chicken Pot Pie soup is yummy. Looking forward to going back to try the Tomato Basil & Broccoli Cheddar.

My sandwich was nice and fresh. It could've used more mustard, because only some bites had it.

I also ordered a wrap, but in panini bread. They forgot to put it in the panini bread and served me a wrap. Not a big deal. Harmless mistake.

Good portion size. A half sandwich & soup fills you up.

Got a free cookie for filling out a quick survey on my phone."}
{"text":"I've never been to the store but since they have a website that's pretty easy to navigate and customer friendly I thought I would try it. Prices seemed reasonable enough so I placed an order, paid with my cc, and requested delivery between 6 and 6:30. The driver arrived really early, I wasn't even home from work yet. My husband answered the door and was told he had to pay cash since the order was placed on my cc and I was not yet there. I called the store and Kimberly said she was refunding my online payment since she had just spoke with the driver. The food was put together as ordered. It was ok...but nothing great. It could have been a better experience if the delivery had not been too early. I have yet to see the refund in my bank account."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli,

I know \"Deli\". But they are soooo much more. They actually cater all kinds of stuff.  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Amazing. And so afforable. The meeting lasted all day and it was one of those \"clock watchers\", after  Jason's breakfast meal I was just watching the clock waiting for lunch and it was Jason's. After that I actually prayed it would be Jason's. Crazy thing is the wedding I went to this weekend....Catered by Jason's."}
{"text":"Outstanding. One of my Favorite experiences in Vegas was the Amazing salad bar at this deli!! Affordable, healthy, and includes hard-boiled eggs!!"}
{"text":"I just hung up.... 21 mintues on hold, no one came to the phone. The first call my phone died after 6 minutes on hold. I promptly  called back on my house phone (for the younger generation...a house phone is a handheld phone that plugs into the wall).


20minutes (and counting) on hold to place a take-out during a non-rush hour?
Fine... you lost a customer today, next time I will bring my awful kids and they will clear your restaurant.

I have to add this.... I didn't get to place the order.

My husband went in and guess what... he called me from JD and tells me the store was EMPTY and they didn't receive any calls! Bull crap I have records!!

While writing this update my husband walks in and he tells me it was the MANAGER that said no one called the store... uhhh... 2 times, 1st time was a young man and the 2nd time was a young girl.
Husband said there was a young man next to the manager that had a \"look\" on his face.... he knows we called."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place is just around the corner from where I was living. I've been there a few times, but I won't go back anymore. They seem to have the same problem so many businesses have - poor customer service. I do like the food, and the place seemed to be clean and organized. However, and this will not shock anybody who has read any of my previous reviews, I am finicky when it comes to being treated nice by the business team members. I did not think that was the case here. I been treated the same each time I have been there...that I was a bother. No smile. No how are you today? Just the kind of unfriendliness that turns me off. I wasn't planning on a negative review, but the young girl at the cash register needs to know how important her job is. For me, she was the face of the business, and she failed at making me feel welcome. I really don't get it, as it costs them nothing to greet their customers nicely, and not make the customers feel like you don't care. It's about people. It's always about people. And this Jason's Deli has work to be done on how they treat customers."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for a salad bar,  checked on yelp.  Considering we had lived in Huntersville for 5 years. It was our first time here.  We ordered the salad bar it was good.  I enjoyed the mini muffins gingerbread and corn muffin.  Everything on the bar looked fresh.  GM came over to see if everything was fine.

Will be back again!  The sandwiches look big and delish !  Great customer service here too."}
{"text":"Love ordering the papa joe sandwich and brocolli cheddar. Always so fresh and consistent!"}
{"text":"I hope I don't spell the name wrong, but Devin at the location on Charleston & Rampart provided us with excellent customer service.  He was very friendly and helpful!  Thank you Devin!"}
{"text":"This is my fave location.  The place is clean, staff is nice, the pricing is right and the salad bar is great.  If you walk in right before they close the staff doesn't rush you.  The staff will always get something for you if its out on the salad bar.  I always get the chicken pot pie soup, salad bar and I get a sandwich sometimes then end up always taking the sadwich home.  The best part is you always get a free ice cream cone when you leave."}
{"text":"Wandered in for the first time today with my wife who is pregnant and has been craving a good deli sandwich. The staff was very helpful and polite. We took an order Home to eat, and once we arrived we realized that the desert we ordered didn't make it in the bag. I called in and spoke with Jayden, she was very polite and I asked if they could just take the charge off my credit card because I couldn't drive back down. She placed me on hold to speak to a manager and came back to tell me they would deliver the missing item to us. Very promptly a driver knocked on the door. Our desert was here along with some extra gingerbread muffins, and a note from the management apologizing for the inconvenience. The note finished with enjoy a cookie on us. There were a couple of chocolate chip cookies in the bag! 

Now this may not seem so amazing, but there are a couple factors to think about : 
1. My wife is pregnant and this made her night! 
2. My wife and I have both worked in food service in the past, and highly respect when people take that extra moment to make an experience memorable. 

Well done Jason's Deli and thank you! You have made faithful customers out of us."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli was a place where I could occasionally eat lunch at when I was a child and it was a place that I could expect exceptional food and service from. However, tonight was annoying.

I walked in and as I did, I noticed the hours on the door: 10AM-10PM. I ordered my food and sat down and then noticed that the employees were packing up the salad bar. I hadn't ordered a salad bar, but they were still packing up at the wrong hour. I had sat down at about 9, which was an hour off of the normal closing time, and yet they were packing their salad bar up. What were they going to do if a customer walked in and wanted to eat from the salad bar? Also, the way they were cleaning the salad bar was unacceptable. They were using cleaner and a paper towel, which is what I would clean the salad bar with, but the problem was that they were spraying chemicals near open food. Those chemicals were getting into food that people were going to eat. How would you feel if you had to eat chemically-poisoned food?

I was a little disappointed, but what really brought my mood down was when they brought out the food. It looked okay at a first glance, but when I bit into the sandwich and sipped some soup, I noticed that the bread was burnt and that the soup was cold. I'm pretty sure not everybody enjoys cold chicken noodle soup or burnt bread.

The food wasn't inedible, so I just ate the sandwich and the chips and watched as a customer was acknowledged 5 minutes after arriving and standing there, trying to draw the employees' attention.

I left feeling disappointed. I'm never going back here again."}
{"text":"I can enjoy Quality food from trusted sources at Jason's deli, the salad bar was very neat and all the food was put out fresh, I appreciated all the options and nothing about the vegetables was under par, but when it came to getting a clean plate for my second go around the staff was questionable of weather I had paid for my meal and salad bar or not, and asked for the receipt which I had previously said I don't need in response to the cashiers question of weather I would like a receipt or not. After that miscommunication everything seemed to be fine until some citizen came in and used the restroom and stuck their bare hands in the trail mix instead of using the tongs, and then just left, disgusted by the lack of recognition I notified the unaware staff and they removed the container of trail mix. All in all it's always a pleasurable experience but this locations surroundings are questionable."}
{"text":"The Meatballa is way better than I expected, and I expected it to be pretty good. Also, I got free ice cream. So there would have been 5 stars given just for that. Ha!"}
{"text":"Lotza choices here,and so far I've never been disappointed..I usually get the rueban..The service here is always friendly,and helpful.Quite often I call ahead and bring my food home..."}
{"text":"Jason's deli is always on point. Although I miss he turtle cheesecake on the menu... They still have free ice cream! The menu is just full of variety. From salads, sandwiches, soups, to baked potatoes. It has a great variety of foods. If you have 30 min and looking for a deli than Jason's Deli is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Update: I downloaded the app and then I could see the menu. Without the app I could not view the menu. Sandwiches look good and I will give it a try when I am in the area."}
{"text":"My girlfriend has an allergy to gluten. And this place is heaven. Gluten free bread for the sandwiches. Gluten free croutons for the salad. 
And the service is amazing. Everyone is helpful,  smiling, and best of all... proactive.  When my soda choice was out, I was standing there trying to decide my 2nd choice. A young man came up to me and asked if I needed anything. I wasn't even disappointed that they didn't have it, but he speed what he was doing and went and fixed the soda. Excellent service. 
Wish the managers that train this staff would show how they do it."}
{"text":"The food was good overall. Service as well, but I did notice they scaled the menu way back and felt my options were greatly limited. Plus they removed the free ice cream. The lobster chowder was but the best though."}
{"text":"Service was slow and order messed up, bread hard as a rock... Get same sandwiches at Arby's that would be better."}
{"text":"I first had Jason's deli while in Utah. Anywhere I have gone to a Jason's deli it's the same great taste and quality! I love to get the club that comes on a croissant. Not to mention the sauce for the fruit is amazing! Anything you eat here will be the best you've ever had. Sometimes there is a wait but it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a tuna melt. It is very delicious and nutritious. 
The Texas chili hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"What a spectacular disappointment. The Ruben is cold, untoasted, and devoid of flavor. To call this place a deli is like calling McDonald's a burger joint."}
{"text":"Stop by for Dinner the other day.

Decide to try a wrap, it was alright I had better. I should have stay with a Sandwich because you can't go wrong. They are very good. The salad bar is very good and they have a lot of items to choose from

Good soups.

I have always had great service and good quality food when ordering the sandwiches I should've known I should've stuck sandwich menu.

I Will continue to come back and support this restaurant because I think it is very good I believe they are either from Texas because I know when I am traveling and I have been to the ones out there"}
{"text":"I have been to several Jason's Deli locations in the past.  And none seem to be this good.  Maybe it is just that they are located uptown and it is a great place to get lunch during work.  Maybe it is that this location is so nice and brand new.  More likely it is due to the fact that the (free) ice cream at this Jason's is beyond wonderful.  I have never had soft serve that was better than what they offer, ever.

The food is good, decently priced, and varied, but I always get the same thing: the club royale.  It is consistently delicious.  The service is always pretty fast considering the huge crowd that is always there at lunch time.  Everything is very good.  But the ice cream?  The ice cream is downright fantastic.  It is like eating a cup of clouds."}
{"text":"For some reason, this Jason's Deli seems to be better than the other ones in the Valley.  I don't know why, but there food always seems a bit better than the same order across town.  Good, helpful staff. Salad bar is quite good and has a lot of variety."}
{"text":"It was ok.  We went right as it opened.  I had to ask for new lettuce because it was brown. The new stuff was just as brown.  Lots of workers but very few going around to clean.  It didn't seem like a clean place overall with all the  workers and just opened I would have thought it to be cleaner.   The salad was good."}
{"text":"Jason's deli catering lunch boxes are tasty and a great value. I've ordered from this particular location several times and unfortunately each time they have been 10+minutes late delivering . This is a disruption when you're in a business meeting and trying to stay on schedule. Something to consider prior to ordering."}
{"text":"The food is always great here. I typically get the salad bar which is always fresh and with a plethora of choices. In addition to being good, it is also endless so you can enjoy as much as you want. Although the food is good, I am writing the review based on the service. I was in this past Sunday and the manager approached us as he saw us looking at the menu displayed on the wall. He asked if we would like to look at menus in hand which had more description and additional choices. After we ordered, our food was very fast and delivered to our table. I was in town visiting friends so we were taking our time and someone came and cleared our plates for us, not in a rushing way, just so we had more space. After our meal I was catching a flight  back to Boston and was in a rush and left without my purse. (It was a small wristlet sized purse). As soon as we got to the car I panicked, and called them. Sure enough they had found it for me. When I returned to grab it, the manager had locked it up for me in his back office. Everything about my experience here made us feel like we mattered to them and they truly appreciated our business."}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean. Salad bar was fresh, with lots of choices. Full menu. I had the onion soup. I would recommend for a family. Relaxed environment ."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Tasty and healthy with organic options. The service here is amazing. Employees couldn't be any friendlier and I always have a wonderful experience here."}
{"text":"My family came in for early dinner 5pm, restaurant was not busy. No customers waiting to be served and the staff of 5 people, NOT ONE PERSON acknowledged us...after waiting 15 minutes and no hey, hello, a woman walked in and was greeted immediately and the worker asked if she would allow us to be served first?!?! Are you freaking kidding me...love their food, however will NEVER GIVE THEM MY BUSINESS

Sadly I spoke to the manager on the telephone and he had no remorse or offered to rectify the situation."}
{"text":"I normally get the all you can eat salad bar , and it's well worth the money. Today I got the the veggie spinach wrap to go @ $5.99. That equals $1 a bite, because that's how much food you get. I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"Super Delicious! I had the Cowboy Deli sandwich, and it was the bomb. and they had free ice cream for when you are done! Service was great too! Although their menu is large and there are tons of options, they did have some small menus so you could take your time."}
{"text":"Clean, good service.  They keep it freezing in there, though.  It actually felt good to go out into the 108 degree weather.  Convenient location.  It is a nice place to get some work done, but they could use a few more accessible outlets for plugging in phones and laptops."}
{"text":"This place has definitely gone down. I ordered a panini, and it was a sad, sad panini. Basically, a toasted sandwich. My boyfriend ordered the \"New York Yankee\" and it was sub-par and dry. We both didn't finish our half orders. To be fair, the salad bar was decent, and the broccoli and cheddar soup was fine. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Best Features: 
Great food and value. 
Clean. 
Free ice cream. 
Friendly staff. 
Classy-Casual atmosphere.

Worst Feature: 
Kinda hard to find if you don't know where to look for it (or if your from a small town where there are no two-story alleys full of restaurants."}
{"text":"I had the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich, all ic an say is YUM! and the French Onion soup was really good too!"}
{"text":"I love the food here but warning - lunch hour is a mad house!  Also, if you want delivery during lunch plan on it about an hour to hour and a half ahead of time."}
{"text":"A favored fallback when I can't get up the energy to cook. Reasonable prices, a really nice selection of healthy/ healthier options, well-prepared, and fresh ingredients. I've never been disappointed at any of the locations.

Nutty Mixed Up Salad, wraps, delicious soups and deserts... Yes, please. Gimme more!"}
{"text":"Different choices of sandwiches but I feel like I could make them myself, nothing over the top special. The carrot cake isn't worth $3.29 a slice either!"}
{"text":"5 stars for Jason's Deli for sure. Boca park forgot my strawberry shortcake* I'm on the south side now and they're bringing it to me as we speak. Services rendered. I tip good."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken caesar salad and a couple cups of soup for pick up. Just got home and noticed they forgot the salad dressing. Now I have to decide if I want to drive 10 minutes back to this location for some dressing, I can drive across the street to Frys and get a bottle of dressing that's going to cost as much as the salad I just bought or I can order a pizza... sigh. Thanks Jason's Deli, now I hate everything that is good in this miserable world."}
{"text":"Amazing Beef Stew and Reuben Sandwich! Love the remodel and the very profession service. Glad to be back Jason Deli!"}
{"text":"Great salad bar. Adding a drink can really add to the tab, so have a water and enjoy the free ice cream."}
{"text":"Gluten free bread for sandwiches....so good.  Get the turkey with avocado and hummus. Yum!

Only thing I don't like is that I have to place my to go order online several hours ahead of picking it up.  That's just too long."}
{"text":"So delicious and fast. I loved coming here for lunch. Then I looked up the calories.   Over 2000. Now I just miss you guys and your cheese covered baked potatoes.."}
{"text":"Decent sandwiches. The salad bar looks great, the deli offers a wide variety of sandwiches (including vegetarian options), AND (win!) they offer a pickle with every sandwich, the way a real deli should.

However, they use cold-cuts, which I'm not a fan of, and their sandwiches were ok. I'd be willing to go back for another round, but just a quick suggestion for anyone looking for an authentic Jewish or New York style corned beef sandwich--they're not going to find it here. Even their pastrami was cold-cut. But for everything else, I'm sure it's going to be deeeelish."}
{"text":"Very friendly helpful staff, great muffaletta and gumbo, priced very well..... and dog friendly on patio"}
{"text":"I always get the Big Joe! The staff is pretty friendly and it's DELICIOUS!! I've also had the chicken alfredo - it's good, but I don't like the penne noodles. I much rather the fettucini noodles!"}
{"text":"This place has been a disaster to say the least!! the last two times we've gone I've gotten food poisoning! Needless to say we will not be returning! Poor management, trashes overflowing, food all over the floors, waited 40 mins for two bowls of soup!! Absolutely ridiculous! We LOVE Jason's Deli but will never go to this location again! I'll drive the extra 25 mins to eat in henderson!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service with a wide variety of food choices. This was my first time coming here and it's very clean and the food was great. Would definitely come back more often."}
{"text":"I have been to this location more than a handful of times, and I must say that I have really been pleased with the service and food here so far. There are a variety of dishes so there's definitely something for everyone. One dish I like is the turkey wrap w/ side of chips, fruit or soup. this is a delicious lowcal meal for me. Management great, service great, food great, prices great. Plus did I mention free muffins, icecrream and other goodies for everyone? What more could I ask for everyone I'm satisfied highly recommended!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat! Great salad bar & the chicken salad (with pineapple & almonds) makes an excellent sandwich. Really like the renovations they did a year or so ago too."}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating here and honestly this was some of the best food i have had in while. Let me start off by saying I am 6months pregnant and my stomach is in knots most all the time, making it hard for me to decide on foods that will agree...... Not here! 

I ordered the managers half sandwich special, that comes with choice of half sandwich and a cup of choice soup. I had the California club with cheddar and a cup of broccoli cheddar soup and it came with fruit on the side. 

Let me say, this is fast food!! The worker was already looking for me to bring my lunch before I was even done getting my water. She put the sandwich plate in front of me with my soup and then they give you a side of sweet cream dip for the fruit..... OMGGGG SOOOOO AMAZING!!!! I rarely finish a plate of food, and here I am almost done with my whole lunch.

Staff was great, food was great and they have free ice cream? What more can you ask?? I can't imagine someone having a bad experience here!! Will definitely be returning in the near future... 

Also I want to add that they have soooooooooooo many different choices on their menu that u could come for lunch 5 days a week and have something new each day!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times.  I try to avoid the M-F lunch rush.  Service is okay. Baked potatoes are huge.  Salad bar has more of a selection than other places.  

Tip: The soft serve is free.  Help yourself. = )"}
{"text":"Can't complain about the food it was quite good. But alas they have one of the big \"no guns\" signs by the front entrance. This establishment has to go on my don't give them my business lists. 

The sad part is the food is really great. But I have my principals and if they called the police on one of my buddies for carrying a firearm my friend would actually go to jail. 

So be warned."}
{"text":"I've been bringing my family to this location since 2003. We love this place. They have always treated us well. The manager has seen our 5 kids grow up, and she greets us every time with a big smile and hug! Love the food! My favorite is the California Club! Our family loves the staff! This is our favorite place!"}
{"text":"A solid lunch option for Downtown-ites.  The place is located on the ground floor of the Molasky Corporate Center, which is also where you park.  (Jason's provides one hour of parking validation, just give the cashier your parking ticket when you pay; each additional half hour is $1.)

It gets really busy during the lunch hour, but I've found that getting there ten minutes early helps beat the lunch time rush.  But even if there's a long line, it moves relatively quickly.

I love that there a ton of different options -- soups, salads, and sandwiches, or if it floats your boat, a giant baked potato.  (The potato is like the size of a small football.)  The variety is especially nice if you're with a big group.  On the downside, it can get pretty loud inside.  

The food is prepped quickly.  But in my opinion, the best thing about Jason's is the soft serve.  Whether it's vanilla, chocolate, or swirled, it's a perfect way to cap off lunch."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the salad bar. Their soup is consistently good and you can't beat the free ice cream of course. The only downside is the staff. It wasn't busy the last time I was there & the dining room could definitely use some cleaning up. Other than that I recommend Jason's Deli for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Good food good prices, nice salad bar. Always easy and fresh. Most of the time they are quick except for lunch time it can get a little backed up.
Still a great spot in a pinch for lunch."}
{"text":"I wish there was a way to give half a star.. this place is horable. Jersey Mikes might be a better place. I went in there at 330 on Wednesday the 3rd with my daughter no idea where the line starts. So I walk up to the register and ask the lady how it works 6 other employees with in arms length. I ordered a hot pestromy with an onion bun toasted then asked her if it was like subway since she didn't ask me what I wanted on it. She said yes . My daughter orders a french dip with no cheese because she can't eat cheese. We were then told to go around the corner and sit down . Wondering when I'm going to be able to add the fixing the the sandwich I ask if I can sit in the dining room the other are was too full and the sun was blistering threw the window... she said no. She did ask if we wanted baked chips or regular.. I said baked thinking I was going to get a flavor choice .. nope never happened basicly were given the over priced meat sandwiches in a bag and shown out.. got home guess what .. my sandwich had 0 cheese and my daughter's was loaded with cheese.. they were rude . No direction . Only receive meat sandwich  and was not given any options for chips other than baked or regular.. for 25.00 subway I could have had every thing I wanted and then some.. horrible experance will never return ever..."}
{"text":"Wow!! What great customer service!! I ordered 26 lunches for our company lunch and expected something to be messed up, but it wasn't!!! I emailed Amy Wacker my order and they took care of everything. They labeled every box by what was in it and who it was for! I was beyond ecstatic!  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great lunch place for sandwich, soup and salad.  We often have group lunch here because it's convenience, good variety of items in menu and reasonable price.  The half sandwich and soup menu is a good value item.  You also get free ice cream cone for desert!  It's just cafeteria food done right."}
{"text":"When you can't get to Katz Deli in NYC Jason Deli is a decent alternative.

Like most deli's the portion sizes are rather large so consider sharing. I had a half pastrami sandwich on rye with a side salad and couldn't finish it all. The pastrami was melt in your mouth good but the rye bread was a little too gummy for my taste. Jason's Deli has a great salad bar as well - perfect for lunch!

Service was okay, although I waited a bit to put in my order because the cashier was on the phone."}
{"text":"They remodeled the inside, and a clueless person installed a bunch of new track lighting that blinds you.  Lights literally \"spotlight\" you at your seat.  Feels like what they show police interrogations as in the movies.  The poor re-design wrecks what used to be a good experience."}
{"text":"As always, great food.  Strawberry shortcake is my favorite.

Got the broc potatoe that's not on the menu anymore.  Check it out!

Clean place, open late and in a shopping complex with other places to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service at Jason's Deli. Sandwiches were generous portions, tasty and the soups was delicious. The seafood gumbo is better than Pappadeaux. From order to table delivery was prompt. Anthony the manager delivered the food to our table and reminded us the Ice Cream was complimentary for dessert. Try the muffins if your eating in. The steady stream of business means they are doing something right at this location."}
{"text":"TL;DR - Excellent food for a dine in experience where time is not an issue. Pre-ordering for pick up does not save time and food is lesser quality. Updated 3/3/15: I've been twice since this review. Once as drivethru/pre-order which worked out fine. Last time was dine in. I bit into an Avocado stem that was in my salad. It was hard and it hurt. For this I'm downgrading to 1 star. The place is a great concept, but they need to work on quality and consistency. 

Original Post:

I've experienced Jason's Deli twice. once as dine in, once as pick-up. 

Our dine in experience was great! I had the Chicken Club salad and it was mind blowingly delicious! A half of the salad was enough to satisfy me. I was very impressed by the freshness and quality of the food. Since we beat the rush hour, we didn't have to wait in line to order. But not long after we sat down to eat, the line was out the door. Our food was delivered timely and my friend enjoyed the salad bar selections as well. 

After such a good experience, I wanted to try it out again. As I had errands to run on my lunch break, I ordered online for pick up, thinking that I'd be able to stop in, pick up my order and pay, and leave quickly (5 minutes tops). Not so. The line was to the door and there was one cashier on duty who was very slow. I ended up waiting 15 minutes to pick up my order. When I finally got to a cashier, she found my order, but if I hadn't checked it, wouldn't have gotten half of what I paid for because it wasn't all compiled. The packaging ended up consisting of 2 paper bags (1 for a salad, 1 for a carrot cake, both in plastic containers) in a large plastic bag. Not very eco-friendly! 

I was in the restaurant for 20 minutes for an order I had placed online. When I got to work and opened my salad to eat it, I was very disappointed that there was water in the bottom of the salad. I appreciate that the lettuce was cleaned, but my dressing became watered down, cold, ranch soup and my bacon and cheese were soggy. The carrot cake was delicious though! Full of raisins, shaved carrot, and nuts and quite yummy! 

Don't go to Jason's Deli expecting quick service, especially during lunch rush hour. You will end up waiting in line, so plan your time accordingly. Also, pre-ordering for pick up will not save you any time, so skip it. I'm tempted to try the drive thru to see if I would be able to get the same quality as my dine in experience but quicker than my pick up experience, but that remains to be seen."}
{"text":"Went to try the Muffuletta sandwich... super disappointing. TWO sad slices of meat on it. The ratio of bread to meat was easily 5:1. Dumb. 
The good news was I could help myself to the pickles, which were delicious, but really I'd rather have enjoyed a meaty sandwich."}
{"text":"I love Jason's Deli, and have never had an issue with this location. It's always clean, and the employees are friendly. I've never had to wait a long time, or gotten a wrong order. Whenever I have the time to sit down for lunch, Jason's deli is one of the first places i'll choose!"}
{"text":"my friend and i just happen to find this place accidentally when our plane home was overbooked and the airline placed us at some cheap hotel off the strip..but i will forever thank the airline for that because of them i have found the most amazing deli this world has ever seen ..im serious.. i got the club royale sandwhich and the plane jane potato and i swear i had died and gone to heaven ! !"}
{"text":"After waiting 2 1/2 hrs for a delivery I called to find out the status of my delivery. I was told they ran out of beefeater rolls that is why I had not recieved my order??? Why wasnt  I contacted I asked I was told because she was too busy. Pretty sad all of the other locations are fantastic!!! Maybe its poor management."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches..alot better than any Subway or Quizno and they have real fresh brewed ice tea, not fountain head, pre-bagged yucky tea.. Sometimes it packs pretty quick during the week, so try to get there before 11am.."}
{"text":"Love Jason's Deli! This is my go to lunch spot. The food is yummy, salad bar is clean and full, and my favorite is the friendly/attentive staff. If you need a spot for lunch with great variety go here!

oh not to mention FREE soft serve !"}
{"text":"Friday night and 3 tables in the place. Now I know why. Do not under any circumstance get a meatball sandwich. Subway is better and I refuse to eat at Subway."}
{"text":"Fantastic salad bar also has one of the best broccoli and cheese soups in town if you like that kind of soup! Finally the plane jane - it's a huge baked potato with plenty of butter, cheese, sour cream, and bacon! I get one of these every time I go, I love baked potatoes-you can even get them done many other ways just ask them !!! All the sandwiches are great I like to build em my way with what I want on em and the muffaletta is really good and something different, so make sure you try all this wonderful stuff, there are many other awesome soups I don't have time to mention and a pot roast baked potato not on the menu but they will make it for you and that's worth mentioning too, enjoy lunch or dinner all!"}
{"text":"I had been waiting for the grand opening of this place so I had to go right away to see what they have to offer. It is a beautiful and espacious building with many tables and booths and a long salad bar, which I think will be their main focus of attention. I had to try it so I went for the managers special, a half sandwich (I chose an oven roasted trky panini) and a side salad bar (which is a nice size).  The panini I got (if you can call it like that) was a wrinkled white bread with a few pressed marks, trky, guacamole, pepper jack cheese and thousand island dressing and even like that it tasted bland with no wow whatsoever, my God, I think I have tasted better sandwiches at the PDQ. The salad was better, they have a nice variety of toppings like beets, green olives, feta cheese besides all the normal toppings you see at other restaurants. Also, at another station they have like mini muffins, nuts, seeds, croutons and crackers to complement your salad. They also have an ice cream machine where you serve yourself for FREE. 

My hubby got the chicken Alfredo pasta with a side of garlic bread and he did not like it at all, pasta was overcooked and the meat and sauce he said tasted like they came from a frozen bag. We really thought maybe they would at least sauté the chicken and sauce to make it fresher. Big dissapointment. We ended up paying $20 something and the only thing worth it was the salad. What a shame because the building is beautiful and it is well located."}
{"text":"Our first time to Jason's Deli was an absolute pleasure. All staff were incredibly helpful and nice. Jeremy greeted me when I arrived and anticipated my needs for a high chair without me asking. He also checked on our table and brought things I needed. Food was spectacular, as was the service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to eat with excellent service. I took my classroom there this summer and they were very helpful, understanding, and treated everyone equally. They were helpful during our crisis situations. Plus their food is excellent and healthy!"}
{"text":"Great food! price a bit high, delivery charge is $7.00. Its ran very well by management.
    However every time and I mean every time we have gotten delivery its been 3 times in 2 yrs. Is easier just to go there, but every time they get it wrong!!!!!! We order the same thing every time in delivery. Omg they don't read the receipt no onions Dont me give me extra onions. Plain Dont mean please put tomatoes and bacon, onions in it. Come on people. Get your head in the game and open your eyes! So FYI DON'T ORDER DELIVERY they read it back to me right. But they made the sandwich wrong. Ggggrr"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service. Everyone is so nice and friendly!  Tim was extremely helpful and energetic."}
{"text":"My company normally places food orders through this location and today our service and order was terrible.  We didn't get anything we ordered correct, the food was dry and old, The soup spilled all over everything, and the delivery driver argued with us and insisted on going to a location in our building that is \"Off Limits\".  The \"manager\" on duty made excuses and in one way or another told us that we always get our order this way.  We have ordered  at least once a month from them for the past year and have always up until today have received it the way we ordered it.  This was a first and with type of service will no longer use them as our caterer.
If I could leave a review with no stars I would."}
{"text":"Much better than Panera, for about the same price.  Food is sooo fresh, they have salad bar, free ice cream.  Soups are amazing, great variety of sandwiches."}
{"text":"All of their soups and sandwiches that I have had were quite good.

These days, I stick with the salad bar because I love it.  Tons of options and always replenished on a regular basis. When I want a filling meal under $10, this is a great go-to spot. If you get the salad bar, you don't have to wait in line. You can use the touch screen when you walk in and go right to pick up your plate.

Fantastic!"}
{"text":"I got house chips with my sandwich. I thought house chips are cooked in restaurant. I received store bought ruffle chips in a plastic sandwich bag. Lol"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I haven't Yelped here before - I would most likely have more than 50 check-ins in the past year or so.  I suppose YELP doesn't come to mind when I am too busy thinking about the Jason's Deli menu and what I will be having for the next meal.  But from now on, I will strive to give one of my favorite places the stars they deserve.

This week my family ate at Jason's (again) and enjoyed every item we had.  One of my favorites is the Ranchero Wrap with a side cup of either Texas Chili (served with no beans) or the Seafood Gumbo.  The Manager's Special of half-sandwich and half-soup is our go-to meal.  The Ranchero Wrap is also served with chips and salsa.

My hubby is in LOVE with Jason's baked potatoes.  He never fails to fall into the trap of the giant Pollo Mexicano served with chicken and jalepenos and cheese.  They have the BIGGEST baked potatoes in town!

For litte ones, Jason's Deli is the perfect place.  Their combination of healthy kids meals is one of the best in town too.  Ours usually enjoys turkey sandwich with fruit and milk.  

And who can complain about a place that serves free soft-serve for all???  Not us!  That little bitty ice cream cone at the end of the meal is a perfect top-off!  

We have come to really enjoy this location and the staff have been super nice and wonderful.  The service is great.  Never a bad experience."}
{"text":"It is what it is and it is also pretty good.... Anything is pretty good on the menu is good. The most interesting thing is their French onion soup is vegetarian..... And it is amazing!!!! I have a craving right now!!! Oh yeah and you get free ice cream.... You can't top that!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible!  Turkey sandwich with hardly any turkey. Nice place but what a rip off!  Even the free yogurt was lousy. Ok, the chips were OK. First time and the last too."}
{"text":"Great food, staff is polite and patient. Plenty of seating and there's really not a bad item in the menu."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good, staff is always friendly... Only downfall this visit, they were out of EVERYTHING!!! Muffalettas, various breads, chilli, soups...  aside from that, one of my favorite lunch stops!!!"}
{"text":"Let me set the record straight. This specific location, it's my favorite of them all, I been in most of them in 17 states and this one it's not only the cleanest one, has the most select vegetables, mostly organic which is something you won't get in most deli's and they're personal attention really puts them in a category apart. 

The salad bar it's always fresh and well stocked and any sandwich you pick, you will definitely get your money's worth. I believe that they're the benchmark in their class, they have the personable attention, the quality and the price. Can't get any better than that."}
{"text":"Dined here twice and that will be my last.  Had the Ruben sandwich, meat was very rubbery and sandwich was bland tasting.  Cost me about $10 for a sandwich , some potato chips and a drink.  Not worth it. Probably better to dine at a sit down for that price."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Chicken pot pie soup is delicious! Sandwiches and salad bar amazing! Free ice cream at the end! It's a great lunch spot and quick service! I go there all the time!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a wonderful dinner of fire roasted tortilla soup and the salad bar. The soup was flavorful and the selection on the salad bar was good and the food was fresh."}
{"text":"This way better than other sub places for the same price. Free soft serve with your order. Awesome."}
{"text":"I love love love Jason's Deli and when they opened this location I was thrilled.  But, unfortunately this location is really sub-par.  They didn't give us what we ordered and then acted as though we didn't know what we ordered.  It was really unpleasant.  Jason's Deli is great just don't go to the Chandler Fashion Square location, bleh!"}
{"text":"I ordered the California club for take out and while i waited i was given free soft serve in a sugar cone which I thought was a very nice treat to give their customers. The sandwich was tasty except for the diced onions in the avocado. While i was waiting 6 people entered to order lunch and the place seemed to be a little cramped. But all in all it was a great lunch at Jason's deli."}
{"text":"Their salad bar is the best... And the pasta tasty!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place.  I dig big sandwiches that you can make your own way, and they always have a nice variety of soups.  I also love love LOVE their Muffalettas.  I haven't found any place that makes a Muffaletta like they do.

But wow has this place gone down hill.  The last few times we've been, there have hardly been any workers at all.  Last time, I had to stand at the cash register for about 5 minutes, waiting to pay, because they had to find an employee who could jump off the food line and come ring me up.  Huh?

The salad bar has also started to look kind of funky, and everything just looks kinda \"dirty.\"  The floors need a good deep cleaning, as do the bathrooms.  And to top it off, the whole place has a very weird smell.  It kind of reminds me of an old elementary school cafeteria.  And not in a good way!

If I had a major craving for a Muffaletta, I could probably convince myself to go back, but I'm definitely in no hurry.  It's a shame, too, cuz I really used to be a Jason's fan!"}
{"text":"Good lunch with the wife Tiffany I believe her name was greeted us very nicely whole entire staff was very nice and polite food came out fast and free ice cream is always a nice touch."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time or used to anyway. The salad bar seems to always be out of a couple of items, no matter what. This just seems to be poor management."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. No tongue, no chopped liver, no side of cole slaw. What kind of deli is this. The pastrami was ok but nothing to write home about. For the price in money, calories and cholesterol it just wasn't worth it. The menu is hard to figure out and I've read more than my share. There are better deli's in town."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli is great!

They have a fantastic menu with food that will keep you begging for more, actually, with the size of the sandwiches that are here, you will make yourself sick if you get more. In addition to the sandwiches, Jason's Deli has a plethora of good drinks and salad bar accessories. In addition, they have a soft-serve ice cream machine, which is free when you get the salad bar. 

Definitely a borderline 5 star restaurant, but the one major thing that holds me at 4 is the fact that they do not have sourdough bread (my favorite). I think sourdough is a pretty common type of bread and I don't think carrying sourdough bread is not a whole lot to ask from a deli of all places."}
{"text":"I went with my husband and 2 kids. I was pleasantly surprised. It was very clean and the food was good. The prices were reasonable. Even my 7 year old liked her food.  I will definitely go back soon. There were so many choices I want to try several things on the menu."}
{"text":"We order lunch for delivery about once a week.  The Reuben sandwich is very good.  Generous meat.  A bit pricey but hey, they deliver!.  The delivery charges are a bit stiff but they can be bullied to make it one flat charge rather than seperate charges per sandwich (which is what they try to pull)
Check your order carefully, sometimes they mess it up."}
{"text":"My boss placed an online order and asked me to pick it up. When i got there, the manager told me that the online payment that my boss already submitted could NOT be used because he was not there, so I had to pay for it with another personal payment. So just a heads up, DONT pay online and dont ask the manager for help."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! I was a little skeptical at first since I'm a vegetarian, but they had tons of organic salads and vegetarian sandwiches.  They are reasonably priced, and even have the option of a 'lighter portion' salad at a cheaper price.  Plus all customers get free ice cream cones and bread from the salad bar...  now that's a deal!"}
{"text":"The food is great and comes out quickly. The service is usually pretty good, although recently the cashier was unable to answer some questions about the menu. The employees smile and are helpful in helping find tables, bringing high chairs, and assisting in any way."}
{"text":"I have made Jason's Deli a serious habit!  Their menu offers a great variety of healthy food, and each entree I have tried has been fantastic!  Their pickles are delicious and their service is friendly."}
{"text":"The employees are always helpful and most of the food I have tried has been pretty good.  The Spud Au Broc is so delicious.  The potatoes are huge and are definitely a good size to share.  I am also always a fan of great salad bar and for the price, it's pretty good.  Throw in ice cream cones at the end and I am a fan."}
{"text":"Good food! But horrible customer service. Granted we walked in at 845pm along with another group of people and they closed at 9pm, the service could have been much better."}
{"text":"This deli offers fresh fare that appears to be made daily. I personally recommend the meatball sub, custom salad bar and the French onion soup. Service is friendly and they offer free drinks and ice cream while takeout orders wait. This is a great alternative to other restaurants that offer boring subs and few menu items."}
{"text":"I am lucky to live in an area that is home to many Jason's Deli restaurants! Whether you want a sandwich, salad, baked potato, or pasta, you can't go wrong with JD. Consistency is key, & Jason's always delivers!

Loaded with a lot of organic options, the salad bar is one of the best I have experienced. At the end of the salad bar you will find chocolate & corn muffins and an assortment of crackers.

Don't forget to help yourself to a complimentary soft serve ice cream when you are finished with your meal.

The staff at this location is usually very friendly. The managers are visible and carry out the same tasks as employees and check on tables. Out of all the locations I have been to, this is by far my favorite! 

In addition to dinning in, Jason's also offers delivery and catering. There is a decent radius for delivery and the charges vary based on time of day and where you live. The charge for dinner delivery recently increased to $7. However, the convenience is definitely worth it when I don't feel like leaving the house or ordering pizza.

My only complaint about JD is the chaos of finding a table during peak times. However, I do my best to avoid these times."}
{"text":"Called up for take out and ordered a Sgt. Pepper.  Was told they no longer had peppers and onions so that sandwich was off the menu.  For that reason my rating went down to 2 stars."}
{"text":"I always have a good experience here. I love their turkey sandwhich and house chips. Try dipping the chips in the fruit dip. yum. The service is so friendly. The runners that bring the food to you have always been kind every single time. Today my sever was Teddy who was really sweet to my 2 year old daughter. And answered all her silly questions. :) thanks for a tasty lunch jason deli!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches (huge variety) made to order. Plus 10 soups and a full salad bar. Known especially for putting together box lunch meals and platters for work/party functions."}
{"text":"One of the better salad bars around.  Great fast-service lunch option.  Healthy (at least healthier) menu choices, with the forementioned salads, fruits, soups and sandwiches.  You order at the counter, pay at the end of the line, and take a number.  Within a few minutes your food is delivered to your table.

Consistent product.  Service and atmosphere are OK, but nothing special.  Nothing fancy, just a decent meal at a decent price.

It can get crowded at lunch, so you may have to wait for a few minutes to score a table, but with dining times probably averaging somewhere around 20-30 minutes and with so many tables, your wait won't be long.

I often get takeout salad bar - for around $8 you load up a giant plastic container with as much as you can.  They even give you a few extra containers to load up dressings, desserts, cornbread, etc."}
{"text":"I can never come to this location without a server getting my order wrong. I had a group of 3 kids who all ordered pasta with just butter. No chicken. No Alfredo and a baked potato with cheese bacon and sour cream. 1st time they brought out chicken Alfredo and a plain potato with nothing on it. Told them the order was wrong so they brought it back. Then they brought out Alfredo and a potato with cheese. Told them it was wrong so they brought it back. Thought third time would be the charm but they brought out pasta with Alfredo sauce and cheddar cheese on top. Won't be back after this experience."}
{"text":"Friendly delivery drivers delivering consistently perfect orders of terribly good food.."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli has good sandwiches and a good salad bar. I like to get the half sandwich and side salad.  The portions are pretty big.  The free ice cream is also nice."}
{"text":"Overated to say the least, this place is like Subway on steroids. Food is bland
turkey sanswich has little to no meat on it. don't waste your time with this dump.
MP"}
{"text":"Ever have one of those days where nothing sounds good, you're hungry and nobody can agree on anything? Well you must have never been to Jason's Deli, cause their kitchen is chock full of fresh ingredients, passionate workers and  awesome recipes. There is something for everyone here. From their baked potato to the California club, flavor and freshness shine through like a prophet's vision. 

There has never been anything on the menu that I've tasted and disliked. Besides, even if I were to discover that a dish was only mediocre, there's free ice cream to numb the pain. They've got you covered like you cover your ice cream with the available syrup. 

A few dishes I've tried have brought on what I call Nostalgiallucinations. A visual day dream of sorts, where the flavor could come from none other than grandmother's wrinkled hands. It literally feels like I'm in a personal kitchen where a spry old caretaker is crafting me delicate sandwiches with a traditional, home-cooked flavor and feel. 

I'm already thinking about when my next visit will be before I finish eating. If you want a simple sandwich done right, look no further."}
{"text":"I tried Jason's Deli a few weeks ago on the recommendation of a friend.  The first time I went, the line was super long.   The line told me it was probably a good place to eat.  Since I hate lines, I skipped it and told myself to go back earlier the next day. 

When I went back, I ordered a basic turkey sandwich.  One gripe was the amount of time it took to make the sandwich for how basic it was.  It was worth the wait, though, because when they brought it to me it was thick with turkey.  Bonus!  

And I felt good knowing it was a healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Tuesday was my first visit to Jason's Deli. I was very happy with my Rueben sandwich. Next time I think I will try the salad bar- great variety and fresh choices. The service was fast and pleasant!
Very extensive menu with lots of choices-almost too many...lol
To top it off the free ice cream cone hit the spot.
I met the manager ,  Justin (?) who was very personable and he was actually working in the restaurant..... always a good sign
I will be back !"}
{"text":"We decided on this place a couple of days ago for dinner. Its nice they stay open til 10pm. Most sandwich places have long closed by then. We have eaten here once before this and it was about the same experience. It was just ok. 

My husband ordered the vegetarian wrapini without the cheese. He is a big eater and this was pretty small. I ended up sharing some of my sandwich with him. I ordered a half vegetarian muffaletta without the cheese. I watched while they \"made\" this. They took a pre-made sandwich out of the fridge, unwrapped the plastic, then removed the cheese, put it on a conveyer belt to warm the bread, and stuck it in a to go container. I was slightly bothered by this. The place wasn't busy, so why couldn't they make my sandwich fresh? I don't know how many other of the sandwiches on the menu are pre-made like this. i am guessing a large number of them. The sandwiches tasted ok. The veggies were pretty fresh so as far as I could tell they were probably made that morning. Every sandwich comes with chips and a pickle, which is nice. You don't have to pay extra for them like most places. Granted, you don't get a choice of chips.  

All in all our total for two sandwiches with chips and pickles and two drinks was under $20. Its a good deal if you don't have any other options available to you."}
{"text":"It kills me to leave this review.  The food itself and array of food deserves five stars, however it's the staff that screws it up each and every time.  No exaggeration.  Every time something goes wrong that is truly annoying, such as getting cold cold soup served before your guest's  entree arrives EVEN IF THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO THINGS ORDERED (?) , a tuna melt comes out not melted and cold, etc, with the blessed receipt describing the order on the tray.  (?)   The timing of the food execution is horrible.!!! You can even see the staff standing in the back on top of each other waiting to take hot food out that is sitting on this massive counter without a heat lamp.   Hard to watch.  Hard to watch staff just stand around and talk when they best be grateful to be working in the first place....  THE BEST PART OF THE WHOLE THING: there are set positions in the kitchen where there are many hands that look over the order before it goes out, a manager or 'expediter'.....???? What is with the expediter?  Looking all dapper and bringing a mediocre, EVERY TIME, tray.   This, seriously? is a CONSTANT at this particular establishment.  The staff ruins the food experience.  Not cool, especially in today's economic market.  Panera is consistently great, especially in the service department.  This place needs to get its act together big time.Again the food rocks but the staff is an impediment."}
{"text":"Just got a whole Ham Muffuletta to share... I was bragging how great this sandwich was. Completely disappointed when the meat portion was 1/2 what It typically is. Freakin' bread sandwich... Embarrassed and apologies to my friends... That's the last time...."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I went for lunch and coincidentally all ordered the salad bar. I added a half turkey club on focaccia which was great, the bread was lightly toasted but still very soft and tender, meat and cheese hot and melted. There were 3 options for greens: baby spinach, mixed greens, and romaine. I chose Romaine and added red, yellow, and orange bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, artichokes, green peas, and feta with balsamic dressing. I also had a spoonful of the pasta salad which was nice and tangy with an italian dressing. Great place to go for a quick no fuss lunch."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and a favorite lunch spot, salad bar is solid. Food is always fresh and you get free soft serve ice cream!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is my favorite place to get salad bar. They have offerings that you won't find anywhere else, such as artichoke hearts and walnuts. The soft-serve ice cream is excellent, the soups are very good. I have not had a sandwich, but i am sure they are good. Service is friendly. If you ask for a 'one-pass' salad bar you will save a dollar!"}
{"text":"I went to Jason's on Saturday night for the first time. I ended up with a side salad and a baked potato. I didn't think you could have a baked potato that big! The potato was huge and could have been a meal by itself. 

Large selection of items to choose from. I wish there was a few more vegtables at the salad bar and had more crouton options. 

I will have to head back to try the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but the California club sandwich was smothered in mayo to the point where it was inedible. My girlfriend got the ranch wrap and said it tasted like cardboard and she will eat anything. No Bueno."}
{"text":"Might be good - might not be.  I called to place a sandwich order for pickup.  They put me on hold and never came back.  I guess they were just too busy to take another order."}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch during the week. The salad bar offers a large variety of items to include fruit, different types or nuts and tuna pasta salad. They also offer free soft ice cream. It's a good place to take the kids as well. Many times I see lots of Mommies together with their kids. Jason's Deli staff really cares about their customers as well. Each time I've gone in, I've had someone ask me how was my food. Each time the experience has been pleasant."}
{"text":"clean, fast service, and delicious food! came with my parents and brother to celebrate my brothers birthday and we are satisfied!"}
{"text":"Went to this place, my first time on sunday, aug. 17, around 3 p.m. for a to go order. Gal told me salad was huge and I asked what mixed greens were. Salad was not huge and the order did not contain mixed greens at stated in the menu. Better to buy a salad bar to go salad, less money and larger. When I asked if there was dressing with the salad, the reply was you didn't specify what dressing you wanted. Well, I was never asked what dressing choice I wanted. Was not offered free ice cream while I waited for the to go order, yet another patron was. I asked if crackers came with this order, no, well I grabbed some on the salad bar I should of ordered on my way out the door. Salad was good, but not what menu specified."}
{"text":"Very good fresh customer service was great felt catered to, was checked on and all was good i say its a must try stuff from salad twice. Thanks"}
{"text":"Ok usually I come to jason's deli for a sandwich, which they do well. This time however, I ordered a \"Big Chef\" salad to go. I get back to work and find iceberg lettuce with sandwich meat thrown in a box! What the hell Jason's?! Maybe I should've gone to the grocery store and bought Lunchables instead!"}
{"text":"Great food, great selection, and good prices for lunch. Also room for seating if you have a larger group. The soup is good and the sandwiches also. They have a salad bar which looks good. Bonus is they have free ice cream for desert!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, but the customer service at this location is not anywhere near where it should be. 

I came to get a to-go order on 11/11. My cashier was Daisha, who didn't greet me at all, just stared at me when I walked to the counter. When I didn't say 'thank you' when she handed me the to-go order, she very condescendingly said \"you're welcome\". 

Will not be eating here again, even though the food is great."}
{"text":"I love, love, LOVE Jason's Deli! The staff is awesome and always friendly. Their salads are to die for - BUT everything on the menu is great!"}
{"text":"Big Joe featured sandwich should be called \"little Joe\". Dont order takeout soup. Leaked all over. Biggest disappointment is that I received a call from a customer service rep apologizing and said they would send a gift card but I have never received it. Do not promise something and don't do it. It makes the experience worse"}
{"text":"I made my way from Old Towne to this location to get to-go and it was ready for me in under 10 minutes.  Nice!!  The food is nutritious and fresh so worth the extra time to pick it up.  Great customer service at every location I've tried so far."}
{"text":"Easily hands down the best in town when it comes to sandwiches, they do cost a bit more but it is ten times better than those major chain sandwiches"}
{"text":"So far, this is the best sandwich joint I've had in Vegas.  I had the turkey ruben and although it had a little too much sourkraut for my liking, it was tasty.  I was also impressed with the salad bar selection."}
{"text":"Good Food, Clean place my kids love it"}
{"text":"Jason's deli has a great atmosphere and even better food. Their muffalattas are straight out of new Orleans, and their salad bar has a fantastic variety!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Price is right and quality is good. The corned beef and turkey are a little dry. All you can eat salad bar is awesome with a lot of variety, muffins, different crackers. They have anything to please meat eaters, vegans, organic food lovers, everybody. You also get a free self serve frozen custard as part of your meal. This is why I keep going back."}
{"text":"I am in complete awe that this location is even affiliated with Jason's Deli. I placed an order today and I just received it. It consisted of a large garden salad with all the trimmings and chicken, an order of penne pasta w/tuna, homemade salsa with corn chips, side of fruit, slice of carrot cake, and a half whole grain wheat turkey sandwich and a juice. The only item I could salvage was the packaged carrot cake, the bag of blue chips and the bottled juice. The total came to $30.00...which I guess seems a little expensive for just one person. With every single item that was prepared self handedly was indigestible.  I honestly end up emptying the entire salad in the trash; the penne pasta was horrible cause it had everything inside it but tuna and I'm not even sure what was in it, so that ended up in the waste. The salsa was inedible. The whole wheat bread was hard and it wasn't even toasted. I actually had to waste the sandwich as well cause I couldn't even bite. I am totally furious, frustrated, and disgusted with Jason's Deli and that is a first. I'm so completely surprised by the food I was just given. I just placed another order with Jason's a week ago at the Henderson, NV location and it was a total Jekyll & hide situation, cause that food was the total opposite of what I received today. I chalk it up to Vegas cause since I've been here, which has been about two months so far, everything in VEGAS has sucked. I'm not going to crucify Jason's just because this location SUCKED...but I won't ever come back to this one and that's why this review is being posted because I want to warn any other future ones, so that don't receive the same terrible service."}
{"text":"This is a good place, busy and noisy sometimes, but the food is top notch, free ice cream for dessert is a big plus for me.  Half California sandwich and tomato basil soup is a winner, as are many things on the menu.  Reputation is well deserved.  I go whenever I can, and I am not disappointed, ever. Staff stays on their toes and things just work well there."}
{"text":"It's nice to go somewhere that offers sandwiches on gluten free bread.  I'm not one of those fad dieters with misconceptions about going gluten free, I actually have a food sensitivity to wheat so I try to avoid wheat as much as possible.  Because of my wheat sensitivity my fiance and I don't eat out that much and I cook for us pretty much every day.  

We've been to this location before, right before we moved to the Glendale/Peoria area, and talked to the manager the previous time.  She stopped by to ask how our food was and we got to talking with her.  She was extremely friendly.

This time, the girl whom took our order was obviously new so she was a bit slower on the POS however she was extremely polite and apologetic for the delays.  She made sure we knew she got our orders right by repeating it back to us, pretty much reassuring us that she's learning.  

We didn't have to wait long for our sandwiches, the place was clean and quite spacious, and the food was yummy.  My only real complaint (which they really can do nothing about) is that their gluten free bread crumbles apart.  However that is normal with a lot of the gluten free breads out there.  The easy way I fixed it was just switching to a fork and stabbing bits of my sandwich with the fork, ta-da!  

They do have a bit of everything there and there food is quite good!"}
{"text":"Been several years since I've eaten at a Jason's deli.  It was just as good as I remember!  I had the California Club and my wife had the Cuban Press.  Both we're delicious and worth the price paid.  Location was a little hard to find as it was behind another business near the mall."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience!  I am so impressed by this place and I'm mad at myself it took me this long to come.  They have a very large selection of sandwiches and a large salad bar.  My favorite part is getting the half sandwich (any on the menu) and half salad (which is large enough to put your head in).  There are complimentary muffins on the dessert bar and free ice cream too.  Everything is fresh and/or organic.  I'll go any chance I'm over this way."}
{"text":"This location is a brand new store that just opened up in the Epicenter. You can get to it by taking an elevator that is right on College St, or you can go through the Bank of America Plaza building (the one with the famous disc out front)--go just past the escalators to the Omni, look left and you'll notice a new set of doors leading to an overstreet walkway.

In case anyone hasn't been there, I'll just mention that it's a pretty decent deli. The salad bar is kind of simple, but not a bad option if you are trying to eat your veggies. I like the muffalettas, but if you are not a fan of olives then don't bother. They also have complimentary soft-serve ice cream whether you order the salad bar or not, so that's always a plus (you can even pull a cone while waiting on a to-go order). 

Ultimately, the more places that open downtown, the better. As much as it pains me to say it, I think more corporate places like Jason's will actually be good for Charlotte. Why? Because they have normal hours like 11am-10pm instead of only being open for a few hours during lunch--a source of frustration for many who live downtown."}
{"text":"I use this store to cater meetings fairly frequently. They're always so friendly and service oriented. I've used other stores around the region, but this one is top notch. Kia is especially helpful! And doesn't hurt that the boxed lunches, both sammies and salads, are delish."}
{"text":"I'm a fan because i can go to the salad bar for 8$ and my man can get a big sandwich just the way he wants it too.. Great deal, fresh and not expensive at all... 
Their salad bar is always fresh and organic is a plus!!! :D
And another plus : i think it's the first place i went to that offer 2 sizes of portion but not \"normal or XLarge\" but \"normal or light\"!! and that is definitely a great step!!! ;)"}
{"text":"Their sandwiches and salad bar are always fresh and delicious. They have plenty of options for anyone who isn't feeling a sandwich, such as, soups, pastas, bagels/pastries, etc. An endless amount of free ice cream for everyone. I like places that offer outdoor seating as well indoor, so that was a plus in my book. The only reason I gave Jason's four stars, instead of five, is because of the staff. Don't get me wrong, they are very nice here but they have their employees constantly come up to tables to ask to take their survey, or if you want a pickle, or how your experience there has been, it's just too much. I assume that when I come in here that at least one, if not more, of my conversations will be interrupted!"}
{"text":"Not too bad. Got the meatball sub. Nothing really making me fiend to come back tho. Overall 3 stars for the complimentary soft serve."}
{"text":"This place is a bit confusing when dealing with the line but other than that it's a great place! The sandwiches are big and full of great stuff! They even give you a mint with your food! They have a zesty stone ground mustard that adds a zing without an over powering mustard flavor.The sandwiches are messy goodness so don't wear your best shirt haha!"}
{"text":"Everything here is good. 
My personal favorite is the Zucchini Grillini. Sometimes consistency suffers especially with this sandwich snd I'm not sure why. But people are nice and what's not to like about free ice cream?
My only beef is that service is slow and seems slower when you're in a hurry. Order ahead if you can."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Jason's Deli but this one is the lone exception.  It was exciting to finally get one of these in the southwest side of Las Vegas, but the location has been deteriorating each and every time I gave it a chance.

On my most recent/last visit, I walk in and am simply wanting to try something different , I ask the cashier a couple questions that would have saved me scanning over a menu and irritating people waiting in line behind me (oh wait, there was no line behind me, it used to not be like that!) his only response was pointing at the menu without muttering a single word.  Final straw, I turned around and left.  Not coming back here again even if the next thousand meals were free.

Back when this place first opened, it was packed.  But there's simply something about this location that doesn't cut it.  I too like many other reviewers have become sick after eating here, even though I never was 100% certain this place was the source, I now suspect it was after reading other reviews.

We've already seen the closure of Mimi's Cafe just next to this spot, I wouldn't be shocked to see this location gone within the next year or two.

There's too many other good choices around to mess with this place.  I hate to be so negative, but this one doesn't even deserve a star.  If you're really craving this place, head up to the one on Charleston in Boca Park."}
{"text":"It was my first time there and I will defiantly go back. Everyone that works there are very nice and super helpful. They gave everyone at my table a box of cookies because they made too many. The salad bar has a good variety and is fresh. I added a cup of tomato basil soup for just 99 cents. They also have free ice cream!"}
{"text":"1st experience-  Had the Italian Cruz Po'boy.  Ok sandwich, the kids seemed to have liked their grilled cheese.  Would return to try something else.  

2nd experience- Had Bird to the Wise.  It was pretty good.  Witnessed a server behind the counter (a larger, older woman) drop a cookie on the floor and placed it right back in the oven like nothing happened.  I looked around.  Are you freaking kidding me??  (Absolutely true story)

3rd experience- Not a chance."}
{"text":"This place is so so. I think there are other delis that are far superior. I don't think we'll be coming here again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love to go to Jason's Deli in the Epic Center. It is located in a very convenient location which is on the second level next to Fire House Subs. The atmosphere is very casual and comfortable. And all the workers there are very sweet. Especially Jailyn and Destiny. They deserve raises. I always get the soup of they day and sometimes a turkey sandwich. My daughter loves the kids meals."}
{"text":"Pretty decent spot to grab something to eat during lunch if you want something filling and healthy. This place was packed, but they seem to have a system down with getting your food out on time. I had a Mediterranean wrap with fresh fruit with my co-workers. The food was very nice ( a little more meat in my wrap would have been nice) and the fruit was actually big, juicy, and sweet. 

Wraps/Sandwiches are AWESOME. A variety of meats, veggies, and spreads combined into a funky combination. 

I did not get the salad bar, but it looked yummy. 

*plus* free complimentary ice cream in a cup.

Food: A-

Price:  A-

Cleanliness: A

Location: C- ( Parking sucks)

Environment: B- ( Don't go if you are not a kind friendly person)

Service: B


Overall: Strictly a place to just grab a bite to eat for lunch or on the go."}
{"text":"Possibly the most I've ever paid for a salad bar. The ambiance is loud and the cashier was so soft spoken I couldn't hear anything he said.  I also ordered a salmon filet that I had to tell them to prepare, which apparently was completed in a microwave. I won't be back, to this location or any other."}
{"text":"Great diner/sandwich joint.  Love their selections of soups.  You can also eat outside.  Lines can be long during lunch hours thought but I think it's worth the wait.  Probably best Deli option in N. Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love this place for ordering takeout. Soup and sandwich options are delicious. Love the option to order from the salad bar online. The potatoes are a great different option too. Fruit is always fresh. I would give five stars, but this one server keeps trying to force Diet Coke on us when we order Coke online. I have an aspartame allergy, so that isn't cool."}
{"text":"Highly dissatisfied with my takeout experience today.  I made a very simple order online--very difficult to screw up.  I assumed that paying online would make my picking up quick and simple--wrong again.
Not only was I waiting forever for the cashier to figure out how to \"fix\" her screwup on payment, but I wasn't told why I was waiting.  Then I was asked for my credit card to swipe, still without an explanation of the situation until I asked why my card was needed if i paid online.
When finally at home, trying to enjoy the meal - I realize part of our order is missing.

Thanks for working hard, Jason's Deli."}
{"text":"I'd heard about Jason's Deli for a while, and never had a chance to try it.  I was in the vicinity though, and finally took the time to stop in for lunch.  It was right at high noon, and I never expected the number of people that were coming and going. That said, it was very efficient - everyone knew what they were doing, and they handled the crowd very smoothly.

As this was my first time through, and not having looked at a menu before hand, I was overwhelmed by the number of choices.  I ordered a basic sub, found a seat, and waited for it to be brought to my table.  There wasn't a long wait, and despite the size and bustle of the place, the order was promptly brought to my table. The sandwich was great, reasonably priced, and filling.

I was amazed at the number of people that they were able to serve, without it ever seeming to be as busy as it was. Next time, I will go when it is not quite as crowded, so I can study the menu, and try some other menu choices - especially their soup, gumbo, and red beans and rice.  

And yes, there is soft ice cream, so that alone will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Due to my work schedule is had the occasion to visit Jason's Deli once a week.  I must say I will be switching back to McAlister's.  Jason's Deli offers small portions of below average food.  When I mentioned to three separate employees including two managers, that I thought the taco salad left a lot to be desired none of them offered any customer service."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli offers a huge menu with food from sandwiches to soups to the salad bar. There is complimentary mini muffins and soft serve ice cream with every meal. They put a generous amount of meat and pricy ingredients such as avocado in their products and aren't chincy. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I love the food and the free ice cream.

I always get my favorite roast beef sandwich there and they never disappoint.  They make it to order and are always fast.  The beef is so tender it melts in my mouth.

Again cant say this enough i love the free ice cream after my meal."}
{"text":"Very disappointed,  It has been over a year since our previous visit and how this place has gone downhill.    Order to go was a Taco Salad and a sandwich,  the Taco salad was more taco chips than salad, was meant to be large so I hate to think what a small one looked like, the sandwich which used to be beautifully wrapped in paper was squeezed into a box that was far too small and finally the bag of chips, OMG you call that thing a bag of chips, lucky there was 10 in it at all.  

For the price charged, the portion sizes, doubt we will be back.

2 hours later we were hungry again, this same meal combo used to set us up for the day."}
{"text":"Me and my co workers order from them quite often. Great food, big portions and decently priced. We order off their website and never have had any problems with our orders!"}
{"text":"I come to Jason's deli several times a month. Salad bar is fantastic and always stocked  with healthy choices. Sandwiches are always delicious as well. I would normally give this restaurant a 4 rating ,but do to the great service  I always receive from one of the employees Kelly  I happily give you a  5! She is always hard working, greets you with a big smile and consistedly gives great service. This kind of customer service is wonderful to see and keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Great meal dining in. Evan delivered our food to our table. He has excellent customer service skills.

One employee walked out the side door to smoke and came in and never washed his hands, he simply put on gloves. My guess would be if just stepping outside for any reason you should wash our hands before preparing food."}
{"text":"Place was busy at lunch time. My first time at Jason's. Service was good and friendly. Food just ok. Seems over priced for what we had. There are significantly better places."}
{"text":"Busy Super Bowl day, got delivery, food arrived at time promised. The delivery man was very kind, took the time to hand out each person's order, and was very patient. Sandwiches were fresh and great"}
{"text":"My daughter and I eat here when shopping in Boca Park. The service is always quick and they have a wide variety on the salad bar everything from bran muffins to soft serve ice cream."}
{"text":"Nice place with a good atmosphere. I had the soup and salad. The salad bar is good. There is a good selection of toppings and they keep it clean. The tortilla soup was fantastic. The staff was very friendly. Definitely a place I will visit again!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the healthiest fast food place you will enjoy!  Whether you eat in or get your order as take out, you will know you're feeding your body healthful and delicious food!  My family and I probably have them every other week.  I can't pick out one thing on the menu that's my fav because everything is good!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Perfect choice for a great salad bar and finish with a free soft ice cream cone! Delicious soups and sandwiches and very kid friendly. Their boxed lunches are great for group meetings, too."}
{"text":"We come here often; every thing is very good.  Wish they had a one trip salad bar and cup of soup for seniors. We would even more often!"}
{"text":"Jason's Deli is a great little find and there sandwiches are damn filling.  If you eat one of them you will be filled up for sure.

I had the Big Joe and it was great 5 stars.  It didn't have too much sauce, which in my opinion can ruin a sandwich, and the turkey were delicious...a perfect combination with their bread.

My friend had the rancho rap. He loved it so much. It was so reasonable price and it has been a long time since I had great sandwich like them.   

All in all four stars and I will return.."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place! Clean restaurant, fast and friendly service, delicious good and a great value! I got Mediterranean Wrap and steamed broccoli and my boyfriend got the Sgt Pepper sandwich and chips. Fresh and yummy! And who could go wrong with free soft serve afterwards?"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Food always taste fresh. Frequently visit ray road location. Ice machine always seems to be broke. Kind of unsanitary to scoop ice with scooper laying in the ice."}
{"text":"I have always enjoy going to Jason's Deli. I haven't been in months,  but I have never been disappointed in any item that I have ordered.  My favorite thing to order is the el pollo mexicano....delish and portions are enormous ;)"}
{"text":"I got home late Monday night and couldn't believe how lazy I felt. So I decided to order dinner from Jason's Deli. I was excited to discover that they deliver. I decided to order a couple sides and a Sergeant Pepper sandwich. The delivery guy was very helpful by calling me and letting me know he was on his way. He also made sure he had correct directions in order to ensure my food didn't get cold while he was searching for my home. I first started by nibbling on the sides of potato salad and steamed veggies. Both were very bland and neither were worth mentioning in a positive sentence. The sandwich was very good. The meat was hot and properly cooked. The cheese was melted by the heat of the meat not the microwave. The bread was fresh and properly heated, unlike Subway. So I'd rate my experience has a solid 3. A 3.5 if that was possible."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in here a couple of times on a work trip because our work wasnt providing us breakfast those days. I am usually pretty skeptical of delis because they always get my order wrong and argue with me when I ask for no mayonnaise, and will always put the pickle on my plate or in my sandwich even though I specifically ask them not to.

But I actually had a good experience here. I ordered the salmon sandwich with a side of fruit. The fruit was fresh and the sandwich was pretty good. The salmon could have been a better cut since it tasted more like rainbow trout than salmon (if you havnt ever had rainbow trout, basically it kind of tastes like dirt), but it was still pretty good. I got them to substitute the aioli for hummus which made for a better spread. I am sure they have a great menu for people who do not discriminate what they eat (I being vegetarian/pescatarian), so most of their menu consists of meat items. But my friend enjoyed his order the first time around, and then got what I got the second time around. If Im ever back in that part of town again I'll try something else and update my review. But Im pretty sure that everyone can find something they like here. They seem to have good quality products and a decent variety of items on the menu."}
{"text":"This is a Good Deli. Good and Big sandwiches. Love the salad bar. Love the soups. Wish they had bagels. At least i didnt see any. Free ice cream that has a really nice flavor. But i wish they had more than chocolate topping. How about some whipped creme and caramel topping folks? You should try this place! You WILL like it"}
{"text":"I see why people say it's inconsistent here. In a whole I love Jason's deli and all of the selections. When I worked downtown I used to order from them 3-4/week and always has same consistency in food. This is my Third time at this location and every time the food is off from the last time, flavors, textures, everything. Corn bread muffins are super soft today and lat time they were crispy. The vegetable soup had barely any chickpeas in it today. But not to worry since I hate them. 

They have a great soup selection and I love that they have vegetarian soups. The French onion is great. I've never had it overly salty which I get a lot at other restaurants. 

Food is always fast and they always go around to make sure you are alright and clear tables. The salad bar is always stocked. 

Check this place out if you want a quick healthy bite to eat."}
{"text":"Not friendly to LEGAL carriers of firearms.

I enjoy Jason's deli regularly. I have not eaten at this location in quite a while. Today upon arrival at the door I notice a no guns allowed sign. Since I was meeting someone there, I returned to my vehicle and stored my firearm as safely as I could, which is to say not nearly safely enough since there is now an uncontrolled firearm in the parking lot. I ate, enjoyed myself and left. This was the last time I will be eating at this location unfortunately. Just a question, would an armed criminal bother to store their illegal firearm in their vehicle?"}
{"text":"We had Jason's cater our in-suite reception this past weekend.  We ordered food for 30 and only had 25 guests, had PLENTY of food left over, which worked out great for the drive home!  The club wraps are incredible!  Communication was easy and convenient, texting and emailing to update status and delivery.  We were beyond happy with the service and food, and you can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"Best salad bar in the area, hands down. Always fresh with great choices. Staff is always friendly and the menu is varied enough to please everyone in the family.  Chairs outside are a great place for lunch when the weather is warm."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite take out deli. Unfortunately not after the inconsistencies in their service. And the staff needs to get the order correct down to a T. They kept mixing the order up or missed putting sauces or sides in our bags. For the amount we pay this shouldn't happen"}
{"text":"Jason's Deli has never let me down! I get the same thing every time but it's hard to pick something else when the chili taco salad is so good! I love that you don't have to pay extra for the guacamole. This last time they had French onion soup on the menu so I ordered a bowl of that to go for my lunch the next day. It smelled so delicious it was hard to not just eat it. The next day I heated it up and man oh man it was tasty. I just wish they would bring back their seasonal potato soup, I had it once before and it was delicious. Potato soup is like my all time favorite. The service is always quick and friendly! When I am craving a taco salad this will be the place I come to enjoy it! Maybe one of these times I'll try and get a different meal to try!"}
{"text":"Long time local fav.  See for yourself !! Have been going here for about 10 years +. Always consistent.  Everything in the menu is top shelf."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but service is very slow..waited for my food for 20 min. 
Reuben is what I always order & there was barely any sauerkraut, I knew it tasted different"}
{"text":"Best Ruben sandwich hands down!!!!!
Came here on a Sunday afternoon and all tables were filthy... they should also rearrange the table setup cause too crowded with the way it is now.barely any room to get to a table and all the tables are  so close to another"}
{"text":"I'm rating 2 stars only on the wife's food experience,I had the new york Yankee pastrami came out as expected big sandwich and pretty tastey,the wife got managers special which is half a sandwich and chips and a bowl of soup needless to say I can find a better lunch place to spend 22.00, her sandwich had no lettuce or tomato  and she even added pesto to it and it was still bland and below average for a Jason's deli sandwich,she also got the beef stew with her meal which was horrible very bland lacking broth to be a stew,I have tasted stews way better from a can like Campbell's or progresso which is a shame"}
{"text":"I get club royale no h.m it soooo delicious nom nom!!!!!!!! Totally recommending this place!! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Never had chicken salad with pineapple in it before... However, if you are in the area, stop in and at least have a sample... A very fresh and interesting twist on a classic... I got a salami sandwich tonight (open late for a deli)... And will get a chicken salad sandwich next time... especially during the hot afternoons here, and probably great during summer evenings too."}
{"text":"Great food terrible service. I waited 22 minutes and never received my soup. I had to ask for it twice and then I had to take it to go because my group was done eating. Too bad this was a good location."}
{"text":"Really like this place. It's located inside a multi level complex building but is spacious enough inside. The salad bar is always my go to thing, which is always stocked with fresh ingredients and red pepper hummus (my fave!)

There is outside seating, where you can take a peak of downtown and the ongoing traffic down Bonneville. All in all, one of my faves!

P.S. I love to grab my ice cream to go, head up to the 7th floor and sit in the awesome SNWA park area. :) 

Stef"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love the decoration, makes me feel like I'm an NYC deli. Decided to go with the Salad Bar and am glad I did. Although they don't have \"Sweet Tomatoes\" quantity in ingredients, they have enough to make a good decent salad. Fresh 4 bean salad, pasta primo, and red pepper hummus are just a few of the toppings, love! they also have delicious corn muffins and pudding.

I also got a side of spicy tortilla soup which was good. All in all 4 stars for Jason's Deli!"}
{"text":"I have had a few good meals from Jason's Deli, but I decided to try the Chicken Chef Salad this time. 

It was so bland! There were only 4 very small slices of avocado, iceberg lettuce (wasn't expecting that), too much cheese, and poorly seasoned chicken. I have had better salads at Wendy's. I definitely won't be ordering this item again."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch the first time last week with a couple of friends.  It has a nice setting and ambiance but the food was average at best and it took a long time to get a couple of sandwiches.  Probably won't go back.

However, as a plus, you do get free ice cream for whatever that is worth......."}
{"text":"Great place to have lunch. The sandwiches are awesome! The soups are always a hit and the salad bar has good variety. For a chain restaurant, not bad at all."}
{"text":"Reliable, fresh and tasy. The corn bread muffins on the salad bar are a treat."}
{"text":"So it seems  that I just went to a really bad, ghetto Jason's Deli. I recently went to the Mesa location and it was really good. I loved the salad bar and that they had so many healthy options, I was very pleasantly surprised! And their multi-grain crackers are awesome.

On an unhealthier note the giant baked potatoes are crazy but soo good!"}
{"text":"I love this place... I wish i could make it there more often! Turkey club is my favorite :)"}
{"text":"Their French onion soup and Amy's Turkey o is a perfect match so damn dank! If you haven't tried Jason's deli you need to get on it,this has been of favorite of mine since my preteens haha (;"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat lunch. They have good food, at reasonable prices, and the quantities are generous. They also have a lite menu and you can go on line to find out the calories your lunch had. They even let you have soft ice cream for desert for no additional charge. I highly recommend this place. One more thing: The staff is efficient and courteous."}
{"text":"I had a hard time deciding what to rate this, so I will explain that the 4-star rating is a higher-end 3-star rating.
 I ordered the chicken noodle soup and it's really salty and too thick, so I added a lot of pepper, which of course makes any type of soup better. I noticed a lot of the items were too salty, actually. I had a little corned beef sandwich on rye and it was also too salty. Yes, yes, I realize corned beef is supposed to be salty, but Jason's overdid it. That being said, however, it was still spankingly good, and I suggest it if you go there.
The salad bar was plentiful, I know for a fact they have 50+ items on the salad bar, and the pickles were really high-end (is it weird rating pickles?), which of course is necessary for any good deli. I sat outdoors on the patio which was really well put together, with clean tables that were not chain-link, which clearly states a high quality restaurant, because if they're chain-link then your crumbs fall right through and you don't get a chance to use your decrumber. :)
The inside is very spacious with shoulder-height walls separating you from other sets of tables. I especially love that if you wanted to, you can see your food being made. Because it's a deli, they don't serve hot dishes, so they have no need for a back room with stoves and fryers and whatnot. All they need is a small heat source like a toaster to warm stuff up in them space in the front. They have two registers, which is useful when it gets crowded at lunch, and of course, the free ice cream is more than acceptable. It is a little frustrating that they only have two flavors (chocolate and vanilla, and a swirl combination), but it is complimentary, so it's not like there are  going to be a lot of options or anything. 
I suggest this place to anybody who loves a good sandwich, but don't order the soup."}
{"text":"This place is great! Food was great also. My son had the kids turkey sandwich which came with a side, and a drink! My husband had the pastrami sandwich, and I had the club! We just moved here from Cali and so far one of our favs"}
{"text":"Lousy management team. Ordered delivery. Delayed over 2 hours. Everytime we'd call they'd say \"driver on his way\" which was never the case. They did not even offer one word of apology. I cancelled the order when I called them the 5th time and they said \"the driver is leaving\". Needless to say, my guests (we ordered for a party of 12) were left hungry. I sent my assistant to subway, which is what I should have done from the beginning. I strongly suggest to stay away from this ill-managed operation."}
{"text":"This place is always my go to. The sandwiches are always plentiful. I find myself always comparing sandwiches to the sandwiches here. It is always delicious. The Ruben Sandwich is my favorite.
And they went above and beyond to get me exactly what I wanted. I wish they had one in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I lLOVE Jason's deli. I am addicted to the Beefeater sandwich! I would eat it every day if I could. BUT, I am not willing to risk my health for them! I walked in to this location today and the sanitation grade was 88!! WHAT??? You can't be serious. I turned and walked out. Please improve the sanitation grade! I would really like to come back here. But as long as the sanitation grade is that low, I will NOT return. Management should definitely NOT be satisfied with leaving a score like that hanging on their wall. IF you have remedied the issues that caused the score to be this low, please call the health department back to come out and recheck your restaurant! I was really craving a Beefeater!"}
{"text":"Had lunch yesterday with a friend and we both ordered the tomato basil soup and half a Rueben sandwich with pastrami.  Soup was barely warm, certainly not hot and the pastrami on both our sandwiches was FULL of fat, which we had to cut off before we could begin to eat.  The bottom half of our sandwiches were SO soggy with the thousand island dressing that we weren't able to pick up without the entire thing falling apart.  We had to use a knife and fork to attempt to eat what was left on the plate.  Soft serve ice cream was honestly the only edible thing on our table.  Total disappointment. : ("}
{"text":"Cheap & Cheerful. 
Jason's Deli is quick and easy. Order and pay when you walk in and they bring the food to your table. Lots of food choices and of course good deli food.
The best part about Jason's Deli is the flaw in service. None of the staff notice all the freeloading. Now I have never freeloaded, from here. But everyone just goes up and dips from the salad bar, taking all the cake they could possibly desire. Why would you pay for a fountain drink when the cups are right next to the machine? My little brother especially loves Jason's Deli because of all the candy laying out and specialty soft drinks in glass bottles. I can't tell you how many times we have had to empty his pockets and send him back or make him pay for the drink he has casually walked off with. 
Despite all the looting happening right before your eyes Jason's Deli is basic restaurant where you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"First time here and I loved it. They had a good selection of vegetarian options and everything tasted great. The cashier was friendly, venue was clean,  food was ready in a timely manner,  and my order was correct,  I can't ask for more than that!"}
{"text":"The staff is really nice, but they get my order wrong about 50% of the time. Sometimes they give me the entirely wrong order, and other times they leave items out. For example, I order the same sandwich every time I go. Inevitably, I've gotten a club sandwich in its place twice. I order the green chile potato salad and end up with chips, but still get charged extra. The food is good, but it's a gamble as to whether you'll get what you actually ordered. I'm on the fence as to whether I want to keep going to this location anymore."}
{"text":"Great prices, great organic foods.  Love the salad bar, clean great choices.  One of my favorites is the meatball sandwich!  Very good.  Free ice cream cone when finished for all!  Great place to eat with kids, free on Wednesdays and organic healthy choices. 

Only thing that sucks, is no free wifi and booths/tables slide all over the floor. Very annoying."}
{"text":"Good food fast service for the size crowd. got to teach my daughter how to swirl a soft serve."}
{"text":"Had a great time. The kids admired the staffs pins and they hooked the kids up with their own on the way out. 
Thanks"}
{"text":"Good stop for a quick made-to-order meal.  Lots of choices, good salad and condiment bar, and complimentary soft serve ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"Ordered online and deliver to a close hotel! Order was completely right for my whole family and food was amazing! Wish they had a closer location to where I live bc the food is so fresh! Had a California club which was yummy! also got a cookie and it was full of chocolate chips and soft!! love this place!"}
{"text":"I found this place by accident and I'm happy I did.  They have an extensive menu and it might be a bit overwhelming but I highly suggest the Italian Cuz po' boy and the Texas chili!  Now I have only been there a couple of times and I have not ventured outside of the two dishes I listed above so I can't comment on everything but I can say these two items are done very well.  Great for lunch!"}
{"text":"If you want an awesome sandwich, go to Flancers. If you want a fast, efficient, consistent sandwich in a place where your kids can scream and no one cares, come here. Cali club is good, salad bar has enough variety. Bonus ice cream at the end. Really a great place for kids. My favorites are the salad bar, cali club, meataballa (though once I think my meatballs weren't cooked all the way through), and the cheese brocolli soup. 
Bring your white bread and American cheese loving kids and friends here, they'll love it!"}
{"text":"We have them deliver to our work about once a week.  Love the choices.
I particularly like the hot pastrami on rye or the hot corned beef  on rye.
Good quality."}
{"text":"I have been going to Jason's Deli for over 20 years now.  This one is one of the better ones in the chain.  I always get the Turkey Muffalatta.  I always want to try something different and there are a lot of good selections, but the Turkey Muffalatta is usually what I get.  I have never opted for the salad bar, but it does look very appetizing.  This particular one is always clean and the staff is really good.  

Don't forget to treat yourself to the free ice cream after your sandwich."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot for those working in Uptwon! This is my usual spot when I am looking for soup/salad/sandwich kinda lunch.

Went here today and got my usual....lighter potion of the nutty mixed up salad with no chicken. It rings in around $5 and is super filling and a great portion. I love that they have free ice cream also (Though, I usually just try and stay away!). 

They have a HUGE menu. I have gotten some of their soups before and have loved them.

Super busy around lunch but they do allow you to call in a pickup order."}
{"text":"Ugh. Was so excited to try this place, the menu looked so good... but.... pretty disappointed. Placed an office order, everyone enjoyed their baked potatoes.. but I opted for the \"yummy\" pot roast sandwich that was so bland. No lettuce so sauce... just beef and cheese on a small French roll. I'm so glad I asked for 1000 Island on the side just in case. I also had some Broccoli soup and that was ok. All in all I may give them another chance, time will tell."}
{"text":"Super disappointed!  I just popped in there to order a salad to go. Ordered the Chicken Club to carry back to work and when I got back to work every piece of chicken was FROZEN. Are you kidding me??? Paid $10 to trash. After that discovery I trashed - had no stomach for it."}
{"text":"There were several issues with this place with our visit around 6pm tonight.  The first one was a clear lack of English speakers in places that were needed to communicate with customers.  This caused a multitude of problems.  First, it took about 10 minutes to get my order taken with two parties in front of me because the others took so many attempts to place their order and not get understood or questions answered clearly (while other employees stood around and did nothing).

Once placing our order of just two salad bars and soup, we then walked down to the end of the counter.  We are immediately told what I think was it would be brought to our table as the person pointed.  No problem, but after five minutes we went back to the counter while nobody was doing anything and told again that it would be brought to the table.  Seriously?  At least give us our salad bowls after 10 minutes.

After about five more minutes we give up and go back and our bowl of soup and two empty bowls are sitting on the counter with nobody around so I just pick it up.

This location need to have people that can communicate with the customers and does not need to take 15 minutes +/- to provide two bowls and a cup of soup, especially with how empty the restaurant was."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I first visited way back when I was a student at UNLV. Now I just go to grub when I am in town. I so wish they had one in South Orange County...but it would probably get F'ed up like many things that make it to the OC...Jason's Deli is my single favorite deli spot because they consistently bring the good eats. I have been to Jason's Deli's all over but this one I give 5 stars because it  iswhere I first experience the yummies that they offer up... Most notable dishes(for me anyways) Plain Jane Baked Potato, Salad Bar, Muffaleta,,Chicken and Sausage Gumbo, and o yeah free soft serve.."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmy!!!!    Had delivered to my hotel.  The delivery man was very kind and courteous.  The food is exceptional.  The portions are large, food is NOT greasy which is a plus plus plus in my book and had a homemade taste."}
{"text":"This Jason's Deli used to be packed. Always crowded. The last couple of times I've come to this location- it's empty, and today I saw why. The restaurant is filthy. Tables aren't being cleared or wipes down, salad bar was a mess. Veggies looked old and withered. It wasn't kept clean at all. Very disappointing and gross. The ice cream machine was also a mess. So dirty. The employees are standing around, drinking soda, not doing a thing. That restaurant needs some serious attention. I have a feeling if dirty dining popped by- they would be shut down. 

On the other hand, the Rainbow and 215 location has amazing service, a well kept restaurant, clean, and welcoming. I will definitely continue at that location and steer clear of Rampart."}
{"text":"GF and I tried today at lunch. As expected a nice, clean store. 

GF went with the salad bar (i think it was $7.50 ) , I went with the New York Yankee - Hot Corned Beef and Pastrami, Swiss, your choice of mustard or mayo ( mayo with CB and Pastrami ... really ? ) on Rye ( $8 ) 

I was a little ticked - I initially wanted a deli Club but i was told they ran out of bacon - on a Saturday during lunch hour ?!?! So i asked the cashier, if i get it do you give me a reduced rate since there's no bacon , big surprise, the answer, \" No ! \" 

I then start to pay the tab ( $21 - included 2 drinks ) with a $100. the cashier says, \" I don't have change for that . \" Holy Shit Batman, here's an idea , go get some frickin' change Elroy ! So i paid with a debit card. 

The food - the sammie - nice portion of meat, decent flavor but dang, they must store the meat in a vat of juice because the one side of the sammie was soaked - overall, it was good but drain the meat a little or maybe put it on a grill for a few minutes. I went with the hot mustard but they didn't come close to put enough on to add to the flavor. 

The salad bar is good - nice selection of items, includes some love muffins, a few dessert items and some soft serve ice cream 

Of course as we left, ? Goofball cashier yells out, please come back sir i'm sure we'll have bacon for you....smart ass !"}
{"text":"my boyfriend and i have been here several times for lunch and we both love it. the staff is very friendly and the place is always clean. my favorite menu item is probably the chicken noodle soup. i most recently tried the chicken panini and it was delicious. my boyfriend had the new york yankee sandwich that was also very good. their manager's half sandwich/salad bar special is well worth it. the salad bar offers a good variety. to top it all off - they have free ice cream. enough said ;)"}
{"text":"I got the Cuban press and tortilla soup and my partner ordered the Cali club. 

My Cuban arrived cold,  which was odd.  Served with pickles, yellow deli mustard,  and Swiss.  The Cali came with bacon,  lettuce,  and avocados. Both sandwiches were served with a bag of Lays kettle chips and a pre package slice of dill pickle. 

This is comparable to a Panera. They do dressed up sandwiches sufficiently.  Nothing more nothing less. 

The tortilla soup had tiny bits of chicken and was otherwise salty. 

I saw there was free,  self-service soft serve machines. Not sure if that's a clever or desperate marketing scheme."}
{"text":"I stop here for takeout on Fridays.  It is always a pleasant experience.  JJ, one of the managers, always is smiling and clearly works hard to provide excellent customer service.  .  I order an off-menu item each week and have always felt like they are happy to provide the service.   The salad bar is ALWAYS clean and has a variety of fresh veggies.  Rick, keeps the tables clean, seemingly enjoys his job and has the most positive attitude of any restaurant employee I have met.  I always leave with a smile."}
{"text":"Great food and always come here. I alway try something different every time I come. Love the idea of free ice cream and corn bread. Who can pass up free corn bread? Must try if your in the mood for a sandwich"}
{"text":"The Reuben sandwich is delicious. I order that each time I go.  The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well. The bread is always fresh and tasty. Great service and clean atmosphere. A go to deli for me."}
{"text":"Good delicious food. Loved the ambiance and the fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I found the staff at this Jason's Deli to be extremely friendly.  I loved the fact that they stopped by the table to check on my dining experience and to remind me that there is free ice cream for the taking at the end of my meal.  I don't recall the staff being this friendly at other locations I've visited.  

Staff aside, it's your typical deli fare.  I don't find anything particularly amazing about the selection of soups and sandwiches.  Though the salad bar is nice, I'm not particularly fond of those.  I prefer minimal human interaction with the raw components of my meal.
While this is an older location, they offer a patio (with strong misters) and ample parking.  It's not a bad place to stop for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I was driving by the deli, and I decided to stop by and check it out. I was helped by a gentleman named Sam. He had exceptional customer service and answered any questions I had. He was extremely polite and friendly. I will definitely be returning. Great food and great employees! (:"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Jason's Deli. It is by far my favorite salad bar to visit. They have enough of the old salad bar standby's that you always want, with an eclectic mix of other items to keep it interesting, like roasted red pepper hummus, gingerbread muffins, and large garlic bread croutons. 

I really don't like the way the bar is set up, though. You have to walk down both sides to get at all the different options. I suppose it saves them space, but it is annoying, and I'd imagine frustrating when busy.

They have great soups and sandwiches too. I've never been unhappy with my choices here."}
{"text":"First of all let me give kudos to the staff who helped us.  It's rare to find such great service nowadays so when I do I like to point out the places that do.

My girlfriend and I decided to eat more salad on our New Year's resolution quest.

She told me about Jason's Deli and how good of deal their salad bar is.  You can literally stuff as much salad in a containter which both people can share.   We did just that while adding toppings. 

We had plenty for both of us and she still had some leftover for lunch.

Thanks for the great experience - we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been on a desperate hunt for the perfect pesto chicken sandwich for years now. Every few months, the craving overcomes me, and I opt to try one somewhere in the city. Today, it was time for Jason's Deli.

I opted to build my own sandwich with chicken, pesto, jalapeños, and pepper jack on focaccia. All the sandwiches come with your choice of chips. I opted for the baked, but I didn't even eat them. I would much rather have fries. 

The pesto was great. They added plenty to the sandwich. The chicken was also good. I wish the sandwich had been warmer - the cheese wasn't even melted. The jalapeños were pickled. I really only prefer fresh, so I took these off. My biggest complaint was the bread. It was closer to a ciabatta than a focaccia. The bread was a bit too crusty and chewy for my liking. 

Overall, the sandwich was fine. 

The service was a little bit rough. The staff all seemed super confused. Only half of a sandwich came out because they apparently forgot to put the other half on the plate...Oops. 

This wouldn't be my first choice, but it wasn't a bad meal."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and liked it a lot!  The service was extemely good and the variety was good also.  I had a sandwich both times I came with the salad bar and everything was very fresh.  The food is affordable and delicious!  For a deli-like atmosphere this is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"I proceeded to watch the four people who ordered behind me get their food before me. All I had was a potato. One guy behind me got the same thing I did (just a larger version) and got his before I did. And when I finally got my potato, it barely had any toppings on it. Really dry. Not tasty. Saving grace is the free ice cream you get."}
{"text":"Extremely Fast Delivery!!! Absolutely DELICIOUS FOOD!!! I recently ordered from them for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised that their ratings weren't way higher than they currently are. The food was so tasty with nice healthy options. I would recommend this place to anyone who is sick and tired of the same old pizza menus and you will be glad you did!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had food delivered for a lunch meeting. Ordered a veggie minus the cheese and they gave me a Turkey wrap. No so Vegan friendly."}
{"text":"Some people like it.  I went here on the recommendation of a cousin, and I was not impressed.  I ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad, and found it very ordinary. 

Inside, it was cafeteria style seating with small tables crammed too close together, and lots of noisy kids.  I couldn't help but notice that a disproportionate number of the customers were overweight.  And it's a small wonder when you look at most of the items on the menu.

Almost every one of their sandwiches, clubs, and wraps, contain significantly more calories and cholesterol than, say, an In-N-Out cheeseburger, in many case over twice as much. 

To be fair, they do have a \"lighter menu\" with six items on it, but only one of those items has fewer calories than an In-N-Out cheeseburger.  However, you can also ask for smaller portions (like half-sandwiches) of most of the items on the regular menu.

Even though this is a deli that serves a lot of natural ingredients that are healthy, it also serves a lot of meats (advertised as lean), but no claims are made that the meats are free of nitrites or other chemical additives.  Since Jason's Deli does make claims that none of their ingredients contain trans-fat, MSG, or high fructose corn syrup (which is all good), I must assume that they have taken no steps to ensure that their meats are free of nitrites and other chemical additives, which (along with my unexceptional experience eating there) guarantees that I will stay away from this establishment in the future."}
{"text":"This place was very over priced, cold atmosphere.  Basic food.. The ice cream is a nice highlight at the end of your meal."}
{"text":"Sandwiches,salads n soup is the best here been coming to this location for some times always free ice cream...."}
{"text":"Staying at a hotel across the street my friend and I were looking for a light (salad/soup/sandwich) lunch place and we saw the sign so thought we'd give it a go and I am SOOOO glad we did! The set up was a little confusing and there were so many options but the manager (who was so friendly!) explained the menu and some of their most popular items. We opted for a sandwich and a salad bar to go. The container for the to go salad was huge! With a separate cup for dressing (they gave me an extra side cup for the cottage cheese too). The salad bar! Wow! All the good things were on it! Artichoke hearts, peppers, pesto caprese salad, mixed greens, spinach, whole boiled eggs, feta, tabouli salad, various olives.....even pudding - I still don't understand pudding on salad bars! My friend got a make your own sandwich with roast beef and cheese and avocado. The avocado was fresh sliced (not some weird mushy mix), the roast beef was piled SOOOO high! Looked amazing. She offered me some but I was doing the best I could to finish my  salad! They also gave us a sample of their strawberry shortcake (delicious!) after we admired it in the case! This is a must return to place both for the food and the amazing customer service!
Ps although we didn't partake - they also have free soft serve ice cream for all their guests ! (that was a lot of exclamation points for a deli review !!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are always looking to try new places, and when Jason's Deli opened, it was a must try location. We had heard from numerous co workers that it was really yummy, so we went! 

When you arrive, you grab a paper menu and wait in line to order. The part that made me fall in love instantly was the fact that they asked us if we had ever been to a Jason's before. We said we hadn't. They were so friendly in explaining how everything worked down to where to get drinks, the free trail mixes and muffins while you wait, and my personal favorite, FREE ICE CREAM.

We both ordered the Manager's Special. This includes a half sandwich and a cup of soup. They have so many soup options! So far, we have tried; Irish potato, cheesy broccoli, chicken chili, and the tortilla soup. They have all been fantastic. My sandwiches have all been great, and I've tried a bite of my husband's too, and they always make me jealous that I didn't order it. 

Jason's is definitely one of our new favorites, because we LOVE half sandwich and soup combos!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!!!! This location was clean and exceeded my expectations. I had a catering order to pick up and had no idea how large this location was and all the food they offered. The sandwiches were great and the staff was pleasant. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have lunch here most every Friday. I look forward to it every week. It is by far my favorite restaurant!! I always leave feeling satisfied. They do their best to make the food as healthy as possible and always improving on that. I never feel gross from the food. The staff is always so polite and helpful and efficient at their jobs and doing it well. One of the employees (I belive his name is Carmelo) is always so nice to my girls and I. He puts a smile on my girls faces. The manager Matt is also an extremely nice person. He goes out of his way to make sure everyone is happy. He took the time to find out ingredients for me which I aprreciated. Baseline and Stapley is my favorite location."}
{"text":"I aet half vegie sandwich and a cup of vegie soup at the Jason's deli at the Rampart ave in about 8pm and than in 30 minutes stat to having a nasty gas pains in stomic when l came to my home and than  9,41pm i throw up that bad all food at Jason's deli. Please watch out this restaurant it's a very bad experiences and all you could get too!"}
{"text":"Legitimate on-the-go lunch stop.   The sandwichs are good and definitely a step up from subway type shops.  Prices are reasonable.  One gripe is that both times I've been there for to-go, the sandwiches took 10-15 minutes to make (from the time I paid until the time I had the sandwich)."}
{"text":"1st time to be here and i liked it. 

Salad bar has alot of options but needs more cleaning. 

Tables need to be clean well too.

Sanwiches are good and well prepared. 

Liked the ice cream and custard

Will come back"}
{"text":"Coworker brought me to Jason's Deli for lunch today thinking how can you go wrong w/ sandwiches & soup

Well, let me tell you...

Only veggie sandwich I saw, was a spinach wrap & if you know me, you remember I *loathe* spinach. So that left the veggie soup

Tasted like Chef Boyardee & for me this is not a good thing. Creamy tomato base, tons of salt combined w/ that long ago prepared taste. Three spoonfuls was all it took before I pushed it off to the side....guess I've been spoiled by SF & its organic, freshly-made-that-day, *homemade* soups 

Coworker got the Turkey Bacon Club & loved his sandwich but I base this review on my meal.....

Sandwich, cup of soup and 1 Soda = $14.....in Charlotte?!

Won't be back"}

Smart business model Go Jason's Deli... To hell with Jimmy Johns skimpy ass sandwiches..

Better sandwiches from Jason's deli and great soups..


Customer for life..."}
{"text":"Talk about an unfortunate trip, all of which is in relation to the salad bar. Maybe I had unrealistic expectations, as my only Jasons Deli experience was the Cranberry location. But nearly all of the vegetables on the salad bar were old, transparent, and inedible. Most were clearly just straight from a large can, straight to the bar. By the time my sandwich came out, I loss some of my appetite. 

The sandwich itself was OK, and the servers were all friendly... but considering this location hasn't been open very long, I expected more from their salad bar."}
{"text":"Thought this would give us the deli fix we needed since no more Miracle Mile at Arrowhead Mall.  Didn't even come close.  The pastrami was stringy, tough and all fat; their cole slaw is really carrot slaw, and they call French dressing \"Thousand Island Dressing.\"   And thoroughly disappointed to get Ruffles potatoes chips instead of those great Miracle Mile fries.  Won't be going back to this place."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just gotta have a salad. And when that \"you\" is me, I often go to Jason's Deli.

Although their salad bar isn't as big as the one at Sweet Tomatoes, I like it nonetheless. Everything is fresh, and I like the crunch that their snack mix and whole-grain crackers provide. They also offer whole hard-boiled eggs if you need a little protein boost. And if you have a sweet tooth, there's free soft-serve ice cream to boot.

Sure, you can always get a sandwich or some soup. But if you're in the mood for a quick salad and you don't want to fill your head with a lot of options, give the salad bar at Jason's Deli a try."}
{"text":"They are always nice. Everyone raves about their food but I have just hated the last two things I have ordered. Not the best for me"}
{"text":"Awesome place for a bite to eat.  Great menu selection...gluten free and vegetarian options.  Love the free ice cream too! 
I had the plain jane baked potato and it was as big as my head.  So delicious!  Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"I get salad most of the time, but I like the soup and sandwiches too. The honey mustard salad dressing has a little zing, nice!"}
{"text":"I ordered the taco salad which is really just a bed of lettuce over some blue corn tortilla chips. I got it with the chicken chili which I guess was ok, but the portion size is quite small. Really you're getting some chips, lettuce, and sour cream. Hardly \"taco salad\""}
{"text":"I was very surprised to find a Jasons deli in Las Vegas, because we do not have them in California. I used to eat at the ones in Texas, and this one was the same. They offer a variety of sandwiches, Soups, salads, and a few desserts. The prices are pretty reasonable. I enjoy getting the manager's special which is around eight dollars, and offers 1/2 of a sandwich and a cup of soup and your choice between chips, fruit, or another side. They offer free ice cream for dessert. The soup is really good, sandwiches are good, and the portion sizes are good. Customer service is a little slow, but overall it's a good experience."}
{"text":"From the people who answer the phone, to the ladies who deliver the lunch to our office, the service is outstanding. They deliver on time.
The food is always hot and delicious.  
The sandwiches are huge. The pickles awesome."}

{"text":"The muffuletta combo with the regular chips and the broccoli cheese soup. That's all. Get that. Reasonably priced and the only ones around that I know of that make a real muffuletta. From the bread to the olive salad it's legit and it's SO GOOD. Yes, I have had other things here but I always walk away thinking... I could have had a muffuletta! If you dip the chips in the soup... and then the sandwich in the soup... needless to say I don't actually use the SPOON in the soup until it's at the very end and I'm down to crumbs for chips and they all just go into the soup cup and I spoon those out. 

This location is always clean. The staff is always friendly. It's busy, but there are always places to sit.

So if you are thinking about Jason's. Get the muffuletta combo with the ham muffuletta and the broc cheese soup. REGULAR chips, not baked. Enjoy and... your welcome."}
{"text":"Well I guess good customer service is dependent on what you look like. I use to always come here and loved it (years ago). I walked in and the first guy at the register literally glanced at me then kept with his busy work. Then as I stood there he then called some other guy to the register. This guy looked at me crazy when I said I get the Southwest chicken chili taco salad. He then was half walking away while I was talking. I just left. I'm sure my money doesn't matter here anyway! Lol"}

{"text":"I didn't find Jason's Deli to be anything special. I had to wait a long time for a Reuben sandwich that wasn't even that good. My wife really enjoyed it, but I wasn't impressed. We used a value coupon and still found the prices to be expensive. It is a strange place, but it did have a cozy atmosphere and is open surprisingly late which I liked! If they had better food I might visit more."}

{"text":"First time at Jason's Deli..  first thing I noticed was the soup selections.. several and different.  If you love this this is the place.  I tried the fire roasted tortilla.  It was flavorful but a bit too high in sodium for me.  Huge selection of sandwiches..  I can't wait to go back and try the muffaletta!  This deli has pasta dishes too - how different.. love that.   Drive through for pick up orders .. pretty neat.  Theres a kids menu too.  The calories for each item are noted on the menu.. nice touch Jason's Deli.  I am excited about returning and trying other menu items"}
{"text":"I eat here about once a week, but usually get take-out. I'm in love with their cheese broccoli soup. I have it so much that I should probably start looking for a 12-step program. I usually walk in, order, and walk out with my food in just 2-3 minutes. I haven't tried the sandwiches or salads at this particular location, but elsewhere I've really enjoyed them. The food here won't blow your mind, but it's quality stuff and hard to top given the price, speed, and convenience."}
{"text":"Huge menu!  I had the Mediterranean wrap it was Delicious and they have the calories posted so I knew that I wouldn't have to feel guilty for what I ate later.  Can't wait to try something else off their menu."}
{"text":"These people r amazing when it comes to delivery and organizing everything and adding generous condiments etc"}
{"text":"This would NOT qualify as \"Deli\" food in the New York metropolitan area, but then neither is Chompies which pretends to be authentic Jewish deli. For Arizona, the quality of the food is okay here, but don't get the roast beef unless it's au jus. It's dry and flavorless. Their rye bread is kind of a cultural joke. It's sort of like rye dough that's been baked like Wonder bread's whole wheat! No crispy crust and not much rye flavor. I must say the service could not have been better. Everyone in this restaurant was working hard like a team that wanted to please customers like their lives depended on it. They really aim to please and wait on you hand and foot and I have to give them credit for that. Reuben sandwich and salad bar looked good, but I didn't try them this time."}
{"text":"Well me and my family came back to give them a try again and it was GREAT. The ice cream machine had the chocolate flavor and sweet tea was in. We'll definitely will come back."}
{"text":"What a great place for lunch. I can't believe we don't have any of these in California (at least that I know of).  I love that you can get a half sandwich and soup and fresh veggies or fruit on the side.  So many choices of sandwiches to choose from.  The salad bar looked great too.  Everyone gets free mini muffins, and the free ice cream for dessert is a great bonus.  And the staff are super friendly.  What's not to like about this place?"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today. Possibly hubby and i's new favorite spot! They also do complimentary ice cream, muffins and pickles etc. to go with your meal. By the way, excellent service!!"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I have ever had service was amazing. And who doesn't like complimentary ice cream and pickles. Not together. Large Variety of tea's and in house drinks. I got the royal club."}
{"text":"Comfort food at its finest: grilled cheese with a bowl of tomato basil soup. Plus free ice cream cones for dessert! my hubby had a delicious Reuben. Great menu and great service. Patio seating where we sat with our dog. Very nice."}
{"text":"first time at Jason's Deli wasn't very impressed with the food I have the mixed green salad and a turkey panini 9 there was very good for $17 for those two things a little overpriced as well the panini sandwich had no real flavor French roll which tasted stale the salad was alright maybe it was the dressing that I chose did not like their balsamic excellent customer service though and they give you free ice cream you can't beat free ice cream I'll give him another try"}
{"text":"The Valley's newest Jason's deli is nice.  Great location.
Stopped in today and had a killer Reuben!

Love this spot!  Glad the SW side has one now!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this place on our way to Sedona.  The service and food were great.  I had the French Dip and my wife had the salad bar.  We enjoyed our meal.  I also enjoyed the free soft serve ice cream."}
{"text":"I am not much of a sandwich girl when I go out but we had Jason's Deli cater us lunch last week and it was a super experience. Our catering plans fell through and they were very accommodating with an order for 70+ people with only a few days notice. We were provided with a box lunch with sandwich, chips, pickle and dessert. I got the roast beef which was meaty and fresh-just like how I like it! It was refreshing to see a chain sandwich place not servicing slimy roast beef (I judge most places by their sliced roast beef) served along a crisp pickle. And don't even get me started on the brownie--it was ooey, gooey and I made a mess with it (a good thing in my book). The only thing that would've made it better was some free ice cream at the end like you get when you walk in but all in all, I was happy with the grub!"}
{"text":"New York Yankee Sandwhich Very Good would highly recommend. Kids meal size was good.and have a excellent Salad Bar. would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"We've been to this Jason's Deli.   Sandwiches and soups are always delicious. 

Today I had the Chicken Panini which was very moist and flavorful with the tomato basil soup which had tons of tomato chunks and is always my favorite.

The service is usually good, but today they got my husband and my son's order wrong.  They promptly corrected it and apologized.

I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"The muffelatta was as good if not even better than the original general market store in New Orleans where it all began. Here they give generous meats and warm the whole thing up which kind of makes each bite/chew orgasmic. While i was waiting i observed the staff preparing a seafood gumbo that looked great, but it just sat on the tray waiting for the other items of the same order that i just figured its losing its vital heat by the minute. It was kind of driving me crazy because i like hot soup not warmish soup.  Glad that wasn't mine cuz it probably was just above room temperature by the time the customer got it. Still the muffelatta gets 5 stars, but overall, 4 stars. Btw, the salad bar looked a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Deli's (next to Capriottis). Even though the restaurant is a national chain, the food is always great! I am never disappointed. I look for consistency in my food (esp if i repeatly order it... i want it to taste the same way as last time),  and fairly priced. 

t's a  fairly busy deli (esp since this one is located near the University). All items are advertised as free of artificial trans fat, plus a section of \"slimwiches.\" 

My company has used Jason's deli several times as well. We all order different things, and we all seem to be very happy everytime.
I recommend this place for office meals as well."}
{"text":"Its only ok here.  There are many teens working herre anbd the serice is not all that good.  Would be fun to work here at that age, but now I am older and want a bit more out of it.  The food is good, pretty good, not great.  Meats are fresh, soups a bit stale from sitting inthe pot too long."}
{"text":"I tried again I made sure to order something completely different. I've always liked the Scottsdale location. I was waiting for my food and the bus boy kept trying to take my silverware and everything like I was done. He was fought me for my spoon before I even got my soup! Not sure what's with this location?"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their food is very good. The workers are very nice too. Their salad bar has many great options. My go to sandwich is the corned beef sandwich. It's very tasty and delicious!"}
{"text":"good food but slowwwww delivery. Over an hour and 20 minutes on a Saturday at 4pm?!? Just go pick it up instead!"}
{"text":"Originally planned to go to Baguette Cafe during lunch break but it was closed due to renovation so the girls & I decided to come here instead.

It was my first time & I loved it! Ordered the Manager's Special Combo & got Tomato Soup & half Papa Joe Sandwich. 

I love the fact that the soup had chunks of tomato in it and just the right amount of cheese. T'was delicious indeed. My soup stayed warm the whole time, too! Seriously! Truly appreciated during this weird, humid, cloudy Vegas day.

The Papa Joe sandwich was a perfect pair! Focaccia bread was fresh and toasted. The turkey, asiago, pesto, roasted tomatoes and mayo just blended well together. Mayo was subtle, there were more pesto and tomatoes. No complaints there!

The portions were adequate considering you get chips as well. I was stuffed! But not too stuffed for ice cream cause there's free soft serve! Yum!

Definitely coming back to try other things on the menu. :)"}
{"text":"First time at Jason's Deli EVER so I ordered the California Club, it was not terrible but I'm also not a fan of toasted croissant bread so that was disappointing. It's very cute how you get a free ice cream cone, definitely helps when it's 100+ out. I'll come back if I'm on this side of town again!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Jason's a few times, and it's been good every time, but tonight I had their Nutty Mixed up Salad and they went from good to amazing. The chicken was fresh grilled and the balsamic vinaigrette dressing is superb. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I stopped in this afternoon with my mother-in-law after leaving the gym.  We decided to have the salad bar and she also had half a sandwich, corned beef. The bread was super soft and her corned beef was perfect. Everything on the salad bar was super fresh, and full. None of the containers were empty there was no food running over and everything was clean and organized. The customer service was pretty amazing! Not only where our drinks filled the first time for us but they were offered to be refilled multiple times. We were asked how our food was by several different people on the floor. The staff was very happy to be there and everybody had a smile on their face. The tables were clean there was no food on the floor. We were very satisfied and we will be returning very soon. Keep up the good work Jason's Deli!"}
{"text":"Wow! Two people ordered dinner and both have lunch for tomorrow.

We ordered the LITE Rueben and LITE baked potato (with sour cream, cheese, and scallions).  They were huge!  I can only imagine how big the full size portion is.

The food was delicious.  

Plenty of indoor seating, drive thru, and quick takeout.

Yep ... we'll be back."}
{"text":"Our Company has been ordering our (sales team) Monday lunches from this Jason's Deli for over a year now. Customer service on the phone has always been excellent, the drivers have always been very kind and on time and the food has always been perfect. All not always easy tasks so we will continue to give Jason's Deli our business because of this. Easy 5 Star. Much Appreciated."}
{"text":"If you want a genuine New Orleans muffaletta, Jason's is the place to go in the Valley of the Sun.  The olive dressing is delicious.  And if you get the special, it is only $1 more for a one-trip salad bar -- fresh and plenty of items.  The all you can drink fountain is now in take-home refill cups.  And the soft ice cream (with chocolate topping, if you like) is included.  The service is great.  The employees are cordial.  What more could you ask for."}
{"text":"Having been to many dozen Jason's across the US, I find myself visiting this location when I want a healthy meal before a Bobcats, Knights or Panthers game. Great salad bar, awesome sandwiches and quality soups are always available and consistency is a strong point. 

The downfall for this Jason's is that it's located in a myriad of restaurants and can be overlooked easily. Meanwhile, it's a inexpensive, quality meal where you can get in and out in minutes if need be."}
{"text":"Salad bar was decent, so I could have given 3 stars. But the vegetable soup was awful. It should run & hide from anyone who has ever tried Cafe Zupa's veggie soup. My friends decided this is no longer a deli since they don't offer brisket & the corned beef is just cold & not steamed, ready to slice like the good delis they used to enjoy. So they each ordered a $7 potato. Those potatoes might be big, but seriously $7??? This isn't one of the gourmet rooms. For that amount they could have gotten soup &  1/2 sammie at Zupa's.
Found out there's even bigger salad bars at a steakhouse nearby for less $, so no need to ever go back here."}
{"text":"I love this place.  So many HEALTHY choices.  
The food is always delicious!   Friendly customer service and amazing food.   Everything your neighborhood deli should be."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday afternoon. Slightly passed lunch time so it wasn't busy. Tried a special they had up on the board. Pastrami Sourdough Meltdown. Asked for a water cup but they gave me a normal to-go-able cup (is that normal? or were they out of water cups?). Either way, i still got water. Not much of a fan of soda anyway. 

Like all other locations, for all customers, free garlic toastettes, and muffins. I love getting a plate full of the brown ones. Always forget what they were called. But not too sweet. Super moist. Unique in flavor. Delicious ^_^ 

Pastrami Sourdough Meltdown was i believe $7 ? Smaller than the usual sandwiches you get from their menu (reuben the great, etc). The pastrami was nice and hot. The cheese was super melty. The sourdough was nicely toasted, not too hard. Best of all, even by the 2nd half, no soggy bottom piece of bread ! (experiences from the reuben the great...) XD sandwich overall was delicious. big fan of pastrami sandwiches. 

After my meal, went for a refill on water. Didn't pick up a ice cream cone this time (free for patrons as well). 

Nice location in Boca Park. Near home."}
{"text":"Love the healthy choices. Food was large portions. Service was very friendly and quick. No complaints other than the prices are a little steep for a deli.  Have eaten there a few times and will go back. Love that they update the menu often with fresh ideas. Even the soups are on point."}
{"text":"So I went here for lunch today. This restaurant is very clean and the salad bar is impressive. They have a good selection of sandwiches, salads and my girlfriend swears the soup is the best ever. 

I ordered a half BLT, a side salad (which I made from the salad bar) and a drink, which came to just a little of $10. I guess for $10 I was expecting for my half BLT to be the best ever in the world. It was just ok. Maybe I should try another sandwich next time. I was expecting a little side salad and they gave me a pretty nice size salad bowl to make my own side salad, which by the time I was done making it, it was a full size salad!! Lots of good stuff on the salad bar and I was impressed with the salad dressing selections as well as the cracker selection. They had organic dressing and organic cracker's! 

I will be going back to try the broccoli cheese soup that my girlfriend raves about."}
{"text":"I ordered the California Club with fresh fruit as my side. The fruit was perfectly ripe and very fresh. Apples, pineapple, grapes and cantaloupe. 

The sandwich was very fresh tasting and the croissant it came on was very light and flaky. Not too buttery. Excellent! 

The drink dispenser had your standard coke products but the only non soda was lemonade. 

The service was quick and I was very pleased."}
{"text":"I know what good pastrami & corned beef tastes like, and this is the real deal. They were  very tender and flavorful, not hard and chewy like other places. I had the Yankee New Yorker with a very good cup of Spicy Fish Gumbo soup. Both tasted so fresh and so good. But I really thought it was cool when my server told me to help myself to the Sundae Bar when I was done. This place ROCKS!"}
{"text":"Wish I had known they were using a MICROWAVE I choose to not have one in my home and certainly don't need to pay some one else to microwave for me. Sad all these places profiting off healthy food claims really aren't healthy."}
{"text":"Always take my kids here to eat, always pretty good and service. But today I waited over 20 minutes for a cup of broccoli soup  and I still didn't get it. Manager was happy to refund the money but in the end I went there to have the soup:(  I was just happy that at least my kids got their meals!"}
{"text":"One of the better Jason's in the chain and I've been to roughly 50 of them! I'm not sure how people can complain about this place. This Jason's, and all of them in the chain, succeed at doing what most large chains can't: providing quality sandwiches, a solid salad bar and better than average soups, every time you come, and for a more than fair price. 

Hands down, it's tough to find a comparable option that brings similar quality, portions and price, all in an upbeat, clean, friendly atmosphere. This is one of the few chains that has something for everyone, regardless of age or taste buds. The salad bar alone is worth coming for. 

Like many patrons, I always go with the Manager's Special: awarding a half sandwich with either a side salad bar or cup of soup. This is more than enough food, but I normally switch out the baked chips for blue chips and salsa (there's an upcharge) or veggies. Meanwhile, for those with a large appetite there's plenty of sandwiches to fill you up, an array of bread options, loaded potatoes, pasta and much more. 

If you can't find something that suits your needs here you can't find it anywhere."}
{"text":"For a salad or sandwich while out shopping this is the place to stop. The food is good and the prices are decent."}
{"text":"I love this place. I get a half sandwich and one trip to the salad bar for $8.50. The trip to the salad bar has so many amazing choices to load up on including feta, beets, potato salad, quinoa salad, etc (and free muffins for everyone) that I usually end up taking my sandwich to go! The quality of the offerings are TOP NOTCH. They don't use cheap, processed ingredients like Sweet Tomatoes. You get a healthy delicious meal and amazing tasting soft serve ice cream too--for free! If you like a loaded, delicious salad--this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Tasty chow at a good price.

My personal favorite is the \"Manager's Special.\" It consists of a half sandwich of your choosing and a side salad that you make on your own at the salad bar.

This particular location is slammed during lunch, be sure to arrive early.  The acoustics if the dining area also make for a loud conversation."}
{"text":"Really good service here but the food wasn't anything special for me.  It was just normal deli foods that I could get anywhere.  We tried the muffaletta, corned beef, and mediterranean wrap.  The food came out really fast though so that's a plus.  Also, they give you free ice cream so that was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"This was my first time in Jason's deli.  

It is very clean, organized and quick which is important for lunchtime.  They have a variety of things to choose from on the menu from soup, salad, sandwiches, wraps and regular meals.  The staff was friendly and helpful and the food was fresh.

I would like to see the calories for all of the items on the menu, not just the wraps.  Otherwise I have no other suggestions for improvement!

Another bonus:

Free frozen yogurt with a purchase of your meal!  And they have chocolate sauce with it!  

Definitely try it out for your sandwich option."}
{"text":"We had very little time for dining and wanted a healthy salad option with our not so healthy favorite hot corned beef sandwich. This was a new Jason's Deli location for us.

Their salad bar was freshly stocked and offered a wide variety of options. They even stock nut mixtures as well as crackers and breads. We enjoyed the salad bar, and even bought a salad bar to-go for this weeks lunches. One to-go salad bar can feed two people for a light lunch.

We shared the Rueben the Great. This sandwich had hot corned beef, melted swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing grilled on rye bread. It is not a small sandwich by any means. This was also very good.

The only genuine complaint about our visit happened during the dining in option. The restaurant was not very clean in general. The fountain station was a mess and the floors were filthy. A personal pet peeve of mine is dining in close proximity to cleaning or busing stations. I just don't think these items need to be stored in eye sight of customers. In this case it was stored near the fountain station and directly in front of my table. When I dine out, I want to see food and a clean atmosphere regardless of where I sit."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery at 621pm. I got my two kids sandwhiches and my BLT with soup after 830pm. It was not worth the wait. There is literally on leaf of romaine used on my sandwich and two halves of tomato slices.When I called the supervisor was kind enough to remove the 3 dollar delivery charge. I wish I had canceled the order. I can't believe I waited all this time for this."}
{"text":"Love the salad bar here ! The best deal is the manager special available all the time where u can get half sandwich and a side salad(well it's a full salad bar actually) all for about 8 dollars ! Salad bar has some high quality organic veggie and greens and it is better than the over priced 13 dollars salad at capital grill I went. Love it here! 
One star less because the sandwich is only average. Oh don't forget the free ice-cream."}
{"text":"I usually come to Jason's Deli for their salad bar. I yet to try their sandwiches because they really look yummy! I have to say that their salad bar doesn't have a wide spread of choices compare to other competitors, but for eight bucks? Why not!?!

I was pleasantly surprised that this particular location, the salad bar was well maintained compare to the other location near the strip. The greens were fresh and crisp. The toppings available went well with putting the whole salad plate together. The options for salad dressings were the typical. As long as they have my blue cheese dressing I'm good to go! :)

The carbs they offer as part of the bar such as the mini cornbread and honey bran muffin were dry, but these were pretty darn tasty! The staff did an awesome job refilling and cleaning the salad bar as needed. Awesome crew and great service! I would rather dine here at this location than the Jason's Deli near my home. I can't wait to see this place after their on going renovation! I shall return!"}
{"text":"You will always find eye candy here during lunch! Fire Fighters, business men and even some gym rats.. 

This is my weekday lunch spot when I am sick of Sweet Tomatoes and cheap Souper Salad has grossed me out too much. I love their clean and unique items on the salad bar, Artichokes, hardboiled eggs, sliced almonds, bean salad, pasta, granola, nut mix, hummus Yes Hummus!! all the must have veggies except beets I with they had those.  You have to pay extra for the soup I can honestly say I have never had it but they always have about 5 or 6 soups to choose from a day. 

When I feel like something more than just a salad I choose the Mediterranean wrap with the turkey on the side(I take it home for my dog because I am a pescatarian), then I get the steamed veggies for a side. 

If I dont feel like a pig after the massive salad I create I head to the frozen yogurt and grab a cone and take off."}
{"text":"So good and fresh and delicious! I never enjoyed my salad this much, my salad plate was made by myself, I put only the delish i love on my plate. Yes it is crazy, I love the fact that you can eat as much as you want with just $9. Free cornbread and ginger bread and icecream. Love it and will be back next week!"}
{"text":"One of the spot my coworkers and I go to for lunch. We usually try to get there before 11am (weekdays) to beat the rush from all the Corporate places near the MetroCenter.  

The deli sandwiches are good.  I usually stick to getting the Amy's turkey-O.  If you plan on substituting a side, make sure you tell them because the cashiers don't normally ask and you'll be stuck with chips.  The salad bar here is very decent for the price.  

Don't forget to get ice cream on the way out!"}
{"text":"I Loved Jason's Deli & treat myself a couple times a month to a Corned Beef Sandwich & potato Salad to take home. Yesterday after a Horrendous Day in AWFUL Nevada Heat I decided to treat myself to a corned beef sandwich and 2 potato salads. I make 2 meals out of my order! I took my order home and was in SHOCK when the rye bread was stale and the corned beef was stringy and Tough!
I am not sure I will ever patronage the warm springs location again!
Andie R."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, the salmon-wich is fabulous!  Awesome smoked salmon with amazing avocado dressing and scrumptious bread.   Amazing!!"}
{"text":"I was impressed. I will definitely go back. I love fresh food and cold sandwiches. Can't beat the free ice cream too! I got the California club on croissant, untoasted with chips and salsa. The blue chips were too crunchy for my liking but the salsa was fresh tasting and spicy. The atmosphere was modern but come prepared to order first, then sit down. I wasn't aware of that and it was a bit awkward as I needed some time to look over their big menu. It all worked out tho since we arrived after the big lunch rush. I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Stopped in after reading reviews. I had 1/2 tuna & salad bar. Partner had 1/2 pastrami & salad bar. Both 1/2 sandwiches huge & delicious. Salad bar full of fresh veggies, greens, potato salad, mini muffins. Ice cream too. Had their own brand flatbread crackers that were outstanding. Employee Jason came to table to make sure we were happy, very personable. Hostess Pamela who took our order was top notch, friendly, gave us good suggestions from menu. Even gave me sample of tuna before I ordered. Great place to go"}
{"text":"WORST sandwich chain in the US. worst service ever! esp that asian broad at the register so rude. She's probably upset bc she was born with a Jay Leno Chin and Man Hands.. Sandwiches are mediocre at best. I'd rather eat a sandwich from the gas station B! eff this place!"}
{"text":"This place is over rated. Gone several time with co workers hoping on the next visit I will try something new and better and yet each item has been subpar at best. Nothing special."}
{"text":"best deli ever...... where do I begin?   freshest salad bar, freshest sandwiches....
today I had the chicken pot pie soup.... tastes homemade.........last week I had the 
tomato soup delicious!! if you are looking for the best place to have lunch this is it 
also Molly the Manager is super sweet , she s always making sure everyones food is 
100 % yummy!! thank you Molly :)"}
{"text":"They are SUPER SUPER nice and friendly here!!! Oh my!! They are so attentive and efficient, so our meals were prepared super fast!!

You guys are awesome at Jason's Deli, and we left satisfied and healthy after consuming our meals!!! :) 

Thanks a bunches!!"}
{"text":"Great option for a light gluten free lunch as most of their meats are gluten free and they offer an Udis bun. My salad was crisp and my fire roasted tortilla soup was spicy and delicious!  Satisfying!"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out today, and what a completely pleasant experience. Often when you call a restaurant, the person taking the call makes you feel like you're inconveniencing them. Jason's Deli was friendly and took the time to get the order right. The order was ready at the stated time, and the food was great (and traveled well). The whole interaction was pleasant and what a relief just to have simple customer service and a product that's what you want it to be."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli ranks as a solid 3 stars in my book.  This is based on multiple visits and having tried various sandwiches/wraps and even the salad bar several times.  I think that their food just doesn't stand out.

I do appreciate their 'healthy' options on the menu (with calorie #s, too) and I do appreciate their salad bar that has a pretty good selection (note that dessert is part of the salad bar.. odd, I know), but I just have to say that nothing I've eaten here has ever made me want to come back.. nor do I ever get a \"jason's deli\" craving.

Their staff has always been adequate and friendly and the facility itself seems to run smoothly (ordering and food arrival is pain free and quick) and is fairly busy at lunch time (it's near a mall and lots of businesses nearby), but, again, their food is OK.  If I want a 'salad', I just go to Whole Foods and do their 7.99/lb salad bar that includes all kinds of meats (Jason's doesn't).. if I want a sandwich, I go to Wildflower for interesting ones or even Sprouts for plain and affordable ones... leaving Jason's at a solid 3.

You do get free soft serve if you eat there, though.. that could be enticing enough for some people."}
{"text":"Two words FREE ICE-CREAM! After a delicious sandwich soup combo where I got chili, California croissant sandwich and fruit I got a free cone!
I'll also be coming back because:
Way better portion sizes than Panera  
About the same pricing as Panera
Delicious sweet dipping sauce for fruit 
Fruit was two melons, two pineapples, tons of grapes, four strawberries and a lot of an apple. Great!!!!
Can't wait to come back and try their salad bar!"}
{"text":"So I went here and I was very excited when I walked in. Awesome salad bar and bakery. I order the ANY half sandwich and 1 trip to salad bar combo. I then get charged extra for ordering the sandwich I wanted even though it says ANY. I then also get charged extra for the 1 trip to the salad bar even though it clearly says 1 trip to the salad bar. The food was very good and the service was good but I won't be back because I don't appreciate false menus or advertising. I hate being lied too. I work hard for my money. Sucks because it was really good. Free ice cream cone was nice touch."}
{"text":"The first time I was invited to Jason's Deli, I thought, \"Eh.  Okay.\"  I'm not a big fan of delis unless it's one in New York City that provides you with a mound (literally) of corned beef and cheese.  

Jason's Deli was much more than I expected.  I wisely chose their salad bar.  For the price, their salad offerings are awesome.  There are items on their bar that you wouldn't find on most salad bars because they're pricier (kalamata olives, for example) than normal salad bar findings.   There are also items like hummus.  What a treat!   When you're finished with your meal, everyone's invited to a free swirled ice cream treat.  Bonus!  Especially on hot summer days.  

Attention parents: Jason's is a fantastic place to bring your kids.  Kids' meals are extremely low for the entree, side, drink, and ice cream!   You can't go wrong with their incredible pricing.  And the fact that their items are healthier than McDonald's or Burger King makes it all the better. 

As for everyone's comments on date night at Jason's Deli, why would you bring a date here?  It's a deli.  \"Hey, baby -- how about we split a muffaletta?\"  Were those dates followed up by a night trolling the street for quarters, too?  It's obviously not a date place, so Jason's shouldn't be judged by that.  It's a place to grab a great nutritious sandwich, soup, or salad at a great deal!"}
{"text":"Jason's helped me with two days of corporate meetings at my place of business.  
Their website was easy and their service was flawless.  
And of course.  Their food was amazing.  Bravo Jason's.  You've figured it out."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. The staff was super friendly and helpful. 

I ordered a deli club with no ham and I added avocado. I also had the broccoli cheddar soup. The soup came out nice and hot and my sandwich was great. The tomato, lettuce, and avocado were all nice and fresh. 

I also enjoyed the free ice cream :)"}
{"text":"As a mom of two, Jason's Deli is awesome. 
The ingredients are fresh and healthy, and the kid's meals are huge and priced right. For my young kids (4 and 2), one meal is enough for them to share. For bigger kids, it seems they could be eating off the kid's meal longer than at some places. 
Add speedy delivery of food and free self-serve ice cream at the end, and this is one happy mom!"}
{"text":"I use to go to this place long before Yelp and decided to try it again now I'm working on this side of town again. It is still a great place to grab a sandwich at, and is good for both lunch and dinner. It's a little pricier then the average sandwich place, however it is still worth a trip for lunch every now and then. I would most definitely recommend Jason's Deli as a place to eat."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their food & I'm a big fan. Anytime I'm craving a good sandwich, this is my go-to.  The only thing I'm really bummed about is they don't have sour dough bread anymore. What kind of deli doesn't carry that? Other than that, the service is always exceptional & someone is always cleaning there!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to give this place a try. I wasn't sure what it was at first, but after a coworker talked it up I figured it would be a good place for my mom and I to try lunch. 

Glad we did. They don't have the full menu printed across the top, just the local favorites, so make sure to grab a paper menu unless you took a peak online at the menu or have dined before. 

We decided to go with the Ranchero Wrap and the Spinach Veggie Wrap, both with a side of blue corn chips and salsa. They handed us a number and we grabbed a table. (The one thing I wasn't fond of is half of the tables were dirty from previous diners. They should either have someone actively  scanning the floor to clean off tables, or provide a few trash receptacles and have diners throw away their own.)

Our food came out promptly, and the woman informed us of a complementary snack bar and the best part ... Free ice cream!! We took a peak at the snack bar, which was actually pretty cool. I grabbed some trail mix, some jalapeños, and a few of their mini muffins. 

The food was good. It was fresh. Our cold wrap was cold, and the hot wrap was hot!  The flavors were good, and it was just a nice healthy lunch. I felt full when I was done, but not in a gross, greasy way. 

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised. It was fast, delicious, and cheap. Friendly employees and other than the dirty tables sitting there, no complaints. We will be returning. My mom caught a glimpse of their corn beef sandwich and that is definitely on our next list to try :).  And need I say again .. Free ice cream!!!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been to a Jason's Deli in a while, but went today for lunch as I had an errand to run near by, and I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe it was the girl at the counter who was so helpful, but in the handful of times I've been to Jason's Deli, I never had anyone tell me about the complimentary ice cream and muffins. Your choice - before or after you eat, no matter. Most people were eating while they waiting for their food to be delivered. I was in awe...ha. The roast beef sandwich was great and the portion was large...couldn't finish it all. If you're in the mood for something fast and lite, make sure to check out the self serve and self pay salad bar...and yes, the ice cream will be there for you too."}
{"text":"I asked on theknot.com for suggestions for catering to have food available while getting ready for my wedding.  Almost everyone suggested Jason's Deli.  

I called about two weeks before to see when would be best to order and she said the day before or day of was fine.  I explained that the day before my wedding was Thanksgiving, and she said that it was no problem.  So I called on Thanksgiving day and they were closed.  
So then I was a little nervous, but I called first thing the morning of and it was no problem.  I was a little annoyed because it was just one more thing I had to worry about on the day, but I think that if the wedding was any other day, other than the day before a holiday, it would have been fine.  

The food was awesome.  It was presented beautifully, it was fresh, and it was really good.   We got the wrap platter, the sampler platter, a veggie tray, & a platter with muffins, breads, and coffee cakes.  The only reason I gave them a 4 stars is because I also ordered juice, coffee, and cans of pop.  They forgot all the drinks.  So I had to call them, but they apologized profusely, and immediately sent out another delivery so it only took like 20 more minutes.

{"text":"Came in on a whim
Looks like Hospital cafeteria but with sanitary issues
No changing gloves between orders or handing cash.
No name tags or health cards visible
Half the employees without hats
90  empty Offwhite refrigerator 
Unhappy Latino employees
Being from Vegas used to cameras so the missing cameras at this location made me feel nervous.  
Their were lots of families. 
My half sandwich manger  special was tasty but small. I figured a 6inch not a literal 1/2 bagel. 
Hope this helps anyone else."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for a quick bite to eat.  I got the club sandwich minus the tomatoes and a cup of chili.  The food was really good.  I like the little graham crackers they have at the salad bar too.  I like this place and recommend it.  They have a good selection so you should be able to find something."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Was expecting something like Corner Bakery or panera, boy was I in for a treat the salad crispy and fresh, my turkey muffaletta sandwich was full of flavor and not greasy.... Did I mention it had actual roast turkey on it. And also the kids meal ranges from items that are about 3.50 (perfect for the under 6 crowd) as well as bigger meals for all under 12. Free ice-cream is just an added bonus."}
{"text":"This place is the best. My girlfriend and I were at a event down the street that I was working at. After setting up for the event we went looking for something to eat (we were starving). We came across Jason's Deli at 9am only to find they didn't open until 10. As we were leaving to go find fast food one of the employees (a very sweet girl) open the door and said \"come on in\". ALL of the staff were very friendly and happy to help us. We both had breakfast sandwiches that were delicious! I don't know about the other locations, but I highly recommend that if you are in the area you go to this one."}
{"text":"The manager that took my order was super helpful. He even gave me a sample of the soups.  While I was eating the soup he got me a cup of water and crackers to go along with the sample while I was waiting for my to-go order. Wonderful experience, superb customer service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for years. Staff is friendly, they make sure my orders meet my nutrition request, and the food is delicious. Love the salad bar. Kept fully stocked, fresh, and they have great variety to mix things up."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start. It sucks to write this review because I generally enjoy Jason's deli. But this being my first visit to this store I'm not pleased. On top of messing up my sandwich. The bathrooms are in a very unsanitary condition and don't look like they have had a good cleaning in quite some time. It's been more than a few days based on the scum on the toilets in the mens room. Bottom line. Foods okay. I'm worried about the cleanliness."}
{"text":"STore was clean, service was quick and I got exactly what I ordered. Definitely seems like Jason's Deli has declined in popularity in recent years."}
{"text":"Whoever managed on August 1st at night was awesome. Funny, friendly and made our night. Go here!!"}
{"text":"I saw all the positive reviews and never been to a Jason's deli. I figured if it had more positive reviews than negative that it must be good. Was I ever fooled. The chicken wrap was good but very pricey for the amount you get. The ham sandwich was a basic sandwich, should of had a pickle included but none came with it. The baked potatoes we ordered(2) looked awesome in the container but when we opened them, the toppings were only a slight layer on top, we had to actually dig for the sour cream and finally found what appeared to be approximately a teaspoon all curdled, the cheese was one small glob of shredded cheese that was more rubbery than anything. We even hauled our own toppings out of our refrigerator and found these potatoes tasteless!! The potatoes at Wendy's are ten times better and much cheaper. There cheese on there potatoes is at least the liquid kind which should always be on a baked potato. The salsa that came with the blue corn chips was so nasty, it tasted and smelled like it was old tomato's stored for months. Even the delivery driver needed my signature for my debit card I used and he didn't even have a pen for me to sign the receipt had to find my own.  Needless to day, First time and Last time at Jason's Deli, way overpriced for the quality you get."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli never disappoints..
One of my go-to's when choosing a place to eat for lunch!

Items I choose are : 
Soups - Tortilla Soup, Broccoli Cheddar or Tomato Basil
Sandwiches - Tuna Melt, Reuben, Beefeater (roast beef on French bread to be dipped in a cup of au jus), or Wild Salmon-wich
Pasta - Zucchine Garden Pasta
Mixed Fruit - served with their creamy, fruit dip

They do a half-half deal.. Half sandwich & cup of soup OR half sandwich with side salad! And they also do a build-your-own sandwich! 

Most of the menu items come with a side of chips and/or fruit! 

Good price for quality and quantity you get!"}
{"text":"I love Jason's Deli. I come here for one thing... the Pastrami Sandwich. The pastrami sandwich is a good size and tastes very good. I have seen my wife eat many different things from here but I can only comment about the pastrami. You can order online and accumulate deli dollars towards future orders. I eat inside every now and then but for the most part I pick up my order at the designated to-go area. The manager is usually visible and is attentive to customers. If you want to do lunch for your office they have different box lunches and catering options."}
{"text":"Solid sandwich and salad spot. Quick service. Good sandwiches. I love the Club Royale. The baked potatoes are HUGE and really good too. 

They have reallyyyyy good ranch. I would go there for the ranch. 

The free ice cream is a cute little addition."}
{"text":"As far as Jason's Deli goes, it's pretty decent.  I would say compared to other deli-style restaurants, it's 3 stars.  You can enjoy their salad buffet, order a (huge) spud or they have a variety of sandwiches.  Nice place to get something simple and yummy."}
{"text":"I LOVE Jason's Deli!! The food is fresh and fantastic, and they have a huge selection. Great  prices and a friendly staff with great customer service. I highly recommend this place to everyone! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Jason's deli is a total treat! What a nice deli with very fresh sandwiches. The beefeater is a big mama jama that comes with a side of aujus pretty awesome if I do say so myself. It can get quite busy so keep a lookout for that. I try to come mid day to avoid the rush."}
{"text":"I will keep this short since I am going to be reading about heart valve replacement for a loved one. I will be doing enough reading for twelve people.  I will keep this short and to the point and not touch on a million things that do not have to do with the food. That way you do not need to read endless paragraphs.    

I love Jason's Deli.  I have been to most of the locations in town and will say they are all clean and consistent.  I had this time a club sandwich minus the tomatoes.  I had a cup of chili too.  The sandwich was great as always.  The chili was really good too.  I do not eat ice cream so I can not comment on their soft serve.
Cheers"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this Jason's Deli a handful of times.  Now it is time for a good review.  I will try not to judge a place on just one trip.  The food that I have had here has ranged from the Deli Club, Muffaletta, Soups, pastas and Salads.  These have all been good.  They have soft serve ice cream, but I can not do dairy so I pass.  The food has never disappointed at all.  I like this place and recommend to anyone.  I think everyone will find a dish they like."}
{"text":"I always order the turkey wrap with fruit.  That darn fruit dip has me hooked!  The turkey wrap is perfect for lunch - fresh tomatoes, avocado, mmmm...  Healthy too!"}
{"text":"California club is fresh and delicious and the reuben is stacked.  Jason's Deli is a favorite of ours in CA and TX."}
{"text":"I was sick and decided to get our food delivered.  Big mistake.  I called at 6pm I was told it would be 45min-1hr.  At 7pm and called to check the status.  I was told our food was ready, but it wouldn't be delivered until 7:30pm, so our food will just sit there?  I was told they will keep it warm.  My husband not feeling well either had to go get our food.  Don't get it delivered you will be waiting and waiting."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite places to go. I am so sad that the one in California has closed down. Its a nice place to go to with a family or big group. If you want to go to a casual sit down, this is the place to go. They have awesome sandwiches. My boyfriend loves to get the papa joe ( turkey, Asiago, roasted tomatoes, fresh basil pesto, mayo, toasted on herb focaccia bread). I like getting their Pollo Mexicano Potato. It can get pretty big, even the half size, but it's really good. I also enjoy the free self-serve ice cream they have there. Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"While the sweet people working the counter were all smiles and helpful and patient, the experience was just \"okay.\"  
The variety of choices at Jason's is great for sandwiches, salads, and pastas.  The taste was simply \"okay.\"  I had a southwest wrap and each half of the wrap only had one piece of grilled chicken.  Strange, right?  This was made up for with an abundance of cheese, which I fully support, but what happened to my chicken?  
The area where you get drinks, near the salad area, was pretty messy.  Just crumbs and spills as you'd expect, I guess, but I expect more.  
My favorite part was free ice cream at the end of my meal - ice cream and free?  Heck yes!"}
{"text":"Why are people giving this place low ratings and have nothing bad to say??? To the point, every dish is delicious. Don't expect to pay the same as a McDonalds meal, the ingredients here are better and some are organic. Love my free soft serve, the whole experience is great."}
{"text":"Had the Ruben pretty blah tasting... Nice place and service is great. More of a Snow Bird restraint crowd."}
{"text":"Good job Jason!  Your deli is great!

Jason's Deli is a good national deli chain.  I've been to several other locations and this specific location did not disappoint.  Located off of Warm Springs, it's easy to find with plenty of parking available.  They have a huge dining area.  So much seating that it would be hard to imagine not finding a table.  The dining area is very spacious and very clean.   

If you haven't been here before, they have many soup varieties as well as sandwich options. I just have to point out the Broccoli Cheddar soup is delicious! They also have pasta salads, fruit and a salad bar to choose from!  Complimentary mini muffins and crackers are on the salad bar for everyone even if you didn't necessarily purchase the bar.  OH...   and complimentary ice cream too.  Hooray! 

Service here has been great.   Everyone from the cashier to the people who bring out your food are smiling and happy.   Jason's Deli is just another good place to eat!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Jason's Deli before but today I once again was blown away and had to stop and say, \"Thank you.\" Today I stopped in a for a quick bit at the store off of Ray near I-10. I was asked what I like and was recommended the \"Pap Joe\" normally I don't like Turkey but I was assured it would be moist, coupled with the awesome Pesto sauce and the cruchy yet soft bread I was in heaven. I had optioned for a soup and the broccoli and cheese was equally as tasty. Gave it a momment to cool down and then thoroughly enjoyed the large pieces of broccoli and melty cheese. The food was brought to me by Sweet Sweet Susan, who took the time to explain the added features at this location, which included a soft serve ice cream cone machine. I really think 5 stars is just not enough for this store. I will be coming back again and again. Thank you folks."}
{"text":"We always get this at work for office lunch..  they deliver and our order is always correct! 

I love the nutty mixed up salad. Fruit, chicken, nuts and mixed greens. It comes with a balsamic dressimg...  Awesome!"}
{"text":"On the way over I was arguing with my wife on the phone.  When I got there I was all pumped up.  I ordered the salad bar.  

My friend ordered a tuna sandwich.  We both had water.

I made a pretty basic salad: iceberg, greens and baby spinach; red onion; olives; pumpernickel croutons; other things and balsamic vinagrette.  Those little ginger muffins they have are siq.  I had a bunch of them.

I spilled my guts to my homie about my situation.  He listened pretty well.  I felt a little better afterward and a little awkard.  

Lunch was pretty good though."}
{"text":"Doesn't matter what time of the day it is, there is always a line. Not because they are busy, but because they have no sense of urgency. Once you are able to order, it takes about 10-15 mins to get your food and when you do get it, they often forget a side part like salsa with a wrap, or yogurt with fruit. I've given them several chances as I do enjoy the food, but the wait and lack of respect from employees that you are appreciated for being there just never improves. I'll go to a place that cares about my business."}
{"text":"Came here a week ago-my daughter got a free kids meal for having good grades at school.
I've never been here,but after seeing how it works, it won't be the last time!
She ordered a kids mac n cheese,with fruit, and drink. she showed me the salad bar, mints, and free ice cream, and self serve soda bar.
 It has a huge seating area, so finding a seat wasn't a problem.
I didn't order anything because of a strict diet, but when it's over, I will be back!
The sandwiches look amazing and I could get my favorite lunch ever-soup,salad, and sandwich!"}
{"text":"We came in just before closing and the staff was friendly! The food was fresh and the salad bar fully stocked! The portion sizes are great and reasonably priced! Also a huge plus...they have BOMB ranch dressing. I mean I'm still having dreams about it!"}
{"text":"Club royale was pretty good, but that's about it. Not crazy about potato chips. I would prefer fries, since the sandwich was almost $8."}
{"text":"Fabulous!  I went there twice during this trip!  Everything I had was good!  I'm def gonna have to make this a regular stop every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip into a Jason's Deli. I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but I don't think it was this. This location is huge (are they all this size?), ample seating, friendly staff, intimidating long line but it moves quickly.

I ordered a Hot Corned Beef sandwich on white, with swiss and russian dressing. Basically a Reuben with no sauerkraut on a different type of bread, and less expensive. Jason's doesn't have coleslaw or else I would have had them make me a Rachel...oh well. My sandwich was good, my fault I didn't have them toast or grill the bread. There was hardly any dressing on it, but now I know for next time. 

If I didn't have a hankerin' for a sandwich, I might have gotten the salad bar. It looked really good when I walked past and I thought the express all-you-can-eat salad bar and soup register (for credit or debit only) was nice, and probably cuts down on the line that this place must form everyday around lunch.

I picked up a menu to bring home so I will be reminded to return when I am looking for a good sandwich and reasonable kids meal pricing. I will definately be back."}
{"text":"Found this place by driving by and I can say both my husband and I were very impressed! We might have a new favorite deli. We ordered hot pastrami and a New Yorker. Both were very fresh and hot, the bread was so soft and their was a ton of meat on each sandwich. We also ordered a salad from their self serve salad bar. I'm usually skeptical of salad bars as they aren't normally good but this one was great! Great variety, clean and very fresh ingredients. And they even have a self serve ice cream, which you can't go wrong there! 
You order at the register then they bring your food to you. The entire time they have an employee walking around the area making sure you have what you need and that everything is what you wanted. Great service!!! Great overall experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"Maybe not the most filling sammmmich I've ever had... but good. It always is. I went there late a night and sat by myself (sad, I know) and just played scrabble on my phone. Maybe someone from Yelp will come keep me company next time!"}
{"text":"After hearing lots of people rave about Jason's Deli I has happy to finally see what all the hype was all about. One day while shopping in the area with my daughter we decided to stop and check them out.

For those of you who haven't been Jason's Deli offers a ton of different items. They offer soups, salads, pasta dishes such as chicken alfredo, penne pasta and meatballs and chicken pasta prima. Different types of loaded potatoes with interesting topping like beef brisket, spinach and pico de gallo. They also offer sandwiches like Muffalettas, Paninis, Turkey Clubs, Reubens, Wraps. You can even build your own sandwich if you don't see one that you like on the menu.

After mulling over the menu I chose the Big E's Deli Burger. It's a roast beef sandwich that tastes like a cheeseburger! It features hot roast beef, American cheese, house made Savage Sauce, lettuce, tomato on a toasted onion bun. Served with chips. The roast beef was so tender and juicy. It was amazing! 

My daughter chose the Chicken Alfredo. It features penne pasta topped with grilled chicken breast, creamy Alfredo sauce and Asiago cheese and comes served with toasted herb focaccia bread on the side. She absolutely love it and devoured every bit of it. 

We both chose sweet tea for our drinks. Even their sweet tea was really, really good. We were stuffed after our meals, but we made sure to get some of their FREE soft serve ice cream before we left.

If you're ever in the area be sure to check them out. If only we could get one in the eastern suburbs."}
{"text":"first time i when was ok   second time i when got the same thing it was nasty nasty  meat felt like it will still uncook or just had funny taste  to  dont feel welcome at all"}
{"text":"This place used to be the \"go to\" place for my coworkers and I to order food from every week. Their food is really good, but I would not recommend ordering for delivery or pickup. They have screwed up at least one thing on almost every order we've ever placed. And the most recent they screwed up three out of four peoples' meals. It was not small stuff either!! It is easier to believe that they are doing it on purpose to mess with us than to believe any group of human beings as a whole can be this incompetent. If ordering for pick up Texas Roadhouse is in the same general area and when you pick it up they open every box and let you see that the order is correct!"}
{"text":"I've dined at Jason's Deli a handful of times. In my dining experience, I'm becoming more fond of local eateries, less fond of chain restaurants. I do have to say, Jason's Deli has been dependable when I've gone there for a meal. 

I've never ordered their salad bar, but I've eaten their turkey and spinach/veggie wraps, nutty mixed-up salad, which I love, pastrami sandwich, and their muffalettas. I think of coming here when I want a decent healthy meal, so I appreciate the light portions and the nutritional info they provide for most of their items. Plus, the kids menu is great for my son and their prices are definitely affordable.

I've read a handful of reviews of how they mess up on customers' orders. Perhaps I've had good experiences with them to have that not happen yet. Their employees have been friendly and I do notice them continually cleaning, keeping things tidy. I even recall once when my son spilled his juice, they were still very polite and took care of it immediately. 

I sense that there's many delis out there that are amazing, which I'm sure I haven't tried. I do enjoy Jason's, yet I feel they don't give me the \"wow\" feeling that other places do when I think of eating there. 

However, they are dependable, convenient, and deliver what I need. Think I'll try one of their huge baked potatoes next time..."}
{"text":"I love Jason's Deli! We used to have one near our home that shut down. This visit reminded me how much I missed it! They have an awesome salad bar that you can get to go, too! My hubby and I each got a half sandwich with the salad bar to go and we shared a large drink. Our total was just over $21 and we could barely finish our meal... it was so much food! Such a good deal and cheaper than any other meal we've had on this trip so far! The sandwich was delicious! The salad bar was fresh! I wish we had one closer again, but we will definitely be back whenever we visit!"}
{"text":"Honestly wasn't too excited to come here to a business meeting but then I tried their California Club On Focaccia & it was delicious. Also, the raspberry white chocolate brownie was absolutely delicious too! Good choice if you need something quick & somewhat healthy."}
{"text":"We went here at 10:30am to grab an early lunch. There was no one in the restaurant, just us and the workers. The lady who greeted us and took our order was pleasant. I got the salad bar, which had a lot of stuff so that's the one star. 

We sit down and I immediately notice employees lounging around everywhere, playing on their phones, doing whatever. That's weird but I'm not the manager. We waited 30 mins to get our food. I got a half sandwich and he got pastrami. Seriously, 30 mins. There was only one lady working and everyone else sitting around. I would've been pissed if I was her. Finally! We get our food, which was served by one of the employees who was playing with his phone. He didn't even say anything as he delivered the food, he wasn't wearing gloves, and I have no idea if he washed his hands. My sandwich looked gross, like it was thrown together. I didn't even eat half of the half I ordered. He ate all his pastrami but had an eyelash on his chips. Gross.   

Do not go to this location. The salad bar was the one redeeming quality, but after the poor service and the eyelash, I couldn't go back for more."}
{"text":"As you walk in you think \"wow\" this place is big and must be expecting a big crowd.  It was my first visit to Jason's as I always didn't ' bother going thinking its something like a Subway. I had  a veggie sandwich which I can't remember the name and the salad bar with no seconds (another serving) as a side.   The sandwich was good but petite.  The salad bar was even better.  Their menu has many items to chose from.
People working there didn't seem like they enjoyed what they were doing and from some  you wouldn't even get a good feeling from them which is not good for business. Well, I don't like fake smiles either but at least one should be pleasant.
Nevertheless, overall I liked the place and will be back to try a sandwich that is more filling next time."}
{"text":"Brief Overview:
Jason's Deli is a healthy dining option that offers meals and salads that meet most family budgets and is kid friendly.

Pros:
- The ambience inside the restaurant is nice and the location is convenient right off of 215 and Rainbow
- They have a nice selection of veggies and toppings at their salad bar for about $8-ish.
- They have a nice 8-12 person conference room for meetings and classes

Cons:
- Not all their food is organic and Non-GMO (after watching Food Inc and Food Matters, I wish all their food was organic and non-GMO, it's kind of a tease with just some it being this way)
- Their company website shows the ingredient lists of their salad dressings and other foods like hummus and I was disappointed by what I saw. This is big for me since they talk a lot about premium and more natural food on their website.

Final Verdict:
I like going here because they have an all you can eat salad bar for a reasonable price and the food tastes great. There's sandwiches, soups, salads, and other prepared meals to keep your tastebuds entertained."}
{"text":"Healthy, easy on the wallet, convenient.  What's not to like.

Jason's deli is perfect for a quick lunch meeting or catering.  Always good quality."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed! I enjoy the all you can eat salad bar and the plain Jane baked potato. And who doesn't love soft serve ice cream!! Highly recommend, they have something for everyone!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the delivery time.  Ordered lunch for 7 people at my office (not a huge order) and at12:35pm we are still waiting.  It was promised by 12:15 at the latest... Maybe not a huge deal to some but when it is a corporate lunch with a set schedule it is a major inconvenience.  With guests who flew in and meeting rooms to book this is very annoying!  Will not order corporate lunches here again."}
{"text":"Try the Lean Mean Sweet Potato. A fun, healthy, inexpensive choice for dinner on this beautiful Valentines Day."}
{"text":"About 1 year ago we were very frustrated when our orders had simple issues and the delivery server who brought the items to your table didn't speak any English.  So how are they suppose to correct the mistake when they don't understand.  So over the past year we have noticed that there are new people and different managers working.  Also the employees who deliver your meal to your table can speak English.  Bonus is that they are getting our order correct 99% of the time now."}
{"text":"it's a typical deli/diner... but today i tried the chicken salad... and i do like the pineapple and almonds in the salad... slight bit of sweetness, moist, and smooth!  :)"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this deli!! I love the salad bar and they have gluten free bread option on all of their sandwiches. Lots of seating, friendly staff, and free ice cream for everyone!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and when they closed chandler I was frustrated.  But they will cater so I ordered that for delivery this week.  Love the club, French onion soup and my son loves their turkey sandwich.  Always a win!"}
{"text":"I love their French onion soup.  The managers special with club and upgrade to soup is really nice.  Bummed they close the chandler location."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent. Today, I was 'greeted' at the register by an employee who was turned around facing the other direction as she mumbled or asked what I wanted to order. Ultimately, she walked off as I was ordering then came along a new employee in training who'd (I am confident) never read the Jason's Deli menu. The order was wrong.I mean if you pay $12 bucks for a sandwhich and soda, you gotta either get the service or food right (not to have too high of an expectation but both would be great)! Alas I did get the signature mint candy in my bag so there's a bonus."}
{"text":"How do they not have 5 stars! People need to recognize great food and great service. The management team is amazing Monica and Matt are two managers that I have been in contact with so far. They always have a great attitude and can not wait to help with anything that might be needed. I've also been treated great by a gentleman names jake who's great attitude could be an example for all of us how live our life's. And on top of that amazing food that always feeds your hunger. I will visit this location as long as I love great food and great service."}
{"text":"I have to have Jason's Deli each time I'm in town. They have Gluten Free bread. 

For anyone gluten intolerant or celiac, its not that often you have sandwiches. When an establishment has bread on hand. You jump. Bonus, nitrate free meats. I feel like I'm cheating, but not really. 

Sandwiches:
GF: you basically build your own. So if its nitrate free, corned beef w/gound mustard. Done and Yum.
My friend orders his club?? on a croissant

Baked Potatoes

{"text":"Well, I can see why some others complained- both my cousin and I got our orders screwed up- however, the food was really yummy.  I had gotten a turkey wrap and cheddar broccoli soup and she got the Reuben The Great and a side of steamed veggies. I even snuck off to the salad bar and stole some pepperoncinis for my sandwich and nobody said anything.  The atmosphere was really open and airy and clean.  Even though they forgot her pickle spear (and she was reallllllly looking forward to it) and gave me chips instead of veggies, the food in and of itself was delicious and apparently they include \"free\" soft serve ice cream that we totally forgot existed unfortunately. I'll totally be back!"}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday and came down with a bad case of food poisoning. I hadn't eaten anything else that day except some coffee at home in the morning. I don't know if it was the salad bar or the chicken soup. The chicken in the soup didn't taste quite right. My friend didn't eat soup and she was fine but we ate different things on the salad bar. A couple hours later the cramps set in, then the nausea and vomiting and low grade fever. If I wasn't 99.9% sure it was food poisoning I would've never written this review. 
     On appearance the place looked very clean and the employees were all very nice so I hate to give only 1 star. Also the chocolate/vanilla swirl selection on the ice cream machine was spitting air and ice cream at everyone, but that was actually pretty funny."}
{"text":"They have the best Chicago sandwich and a baked potato with broccoli cheese soup on it! I dont know the proper name for that potato but if u say that they know which potato. We were recommended this place when staying in children's hospital in Vegas and ever since we are near or around one we stop to eat! A little pricey but I believe all the food is organic. It tastes aaaammmaazzzing! Highly recommend! We havent tried anything else besides that sandwich and potato. But I'm sure everything else on their menu is great."}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the ham Muffaletta sandwich and fire roasted tortilla soup (which is included with chips). There is also complimentary ice cream and cornbread. The staff is super friendly!  I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Casual and fun deli spot!

This is a great spot for some casual deli food and they have a really great salad bar. Typically that's my pick and and I top my fresh lettuce with tomatoes, cheese, cucumbers, hard boiled eggs and my favorite dressings here are the house ranch or balsamic. I also grab a side a hummus and a few crispy croutons and my meal is complete. I also love the club royale which comes on a fresh croissant with ham, turkey, tomatoes, bacon, swiss, cheddar, lettuce and honey mustard sauce, it's so so so good! 

The service is good and as you need to fill up on anything from the salad bar or drink station you walk up and get it yourself. They also have ice cream, free for all. It's a soft serve station and I love it! So overall this is a great spot and very casual. I also want to mention they have a wide variety of soups! I've tried a few of them and all were good. One of my favorites is the tomato soup that you can get with a grilled cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"My wife asked about the southwest chili being spicy. The man at the register offered to have her sample it. He also brought a sample of another soup that wasn't as spicy for her to try. Great customer experience. Great tasting food. Very clean. Friendly staff. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli is one of my favorite places to go for sandwiches or salads. They have a good size menu with a lot of variety. The sandwiches are all full of flavor and won't leave you hungry. If you do the salad bar I recommend doing the all you can eat. They give you to choices of greenery and the rest of the salad bar is toppings, including artichoke hearts and different types of cheeses. I usually order the Mediterranean Wrap. They offer a lot of organic and Gluten Sensitive items too!"}
{"text":"So my favorite menu item is really no more, as they've discontinued their whole-grain ciabatta bread.  Sadness."}
{"text":"The Manager's Special is 1/2 of a sandwich and soup or salad with chips or an apple.  This seems to be what I always get.  It's about the right proportions.  I got the corned beef on toasted sourdough and broccoli cheese soup and chips.  I love that they serve sweet tea as it is something I grew up with in the South.  I tend to make it half sweet tea and half regular tea.  And then there's the free ice cream cone which I actually passed on.  

I did notice they were doing some renovations to the restaurant so I would like to come back and see how it turned out.  Seems that they were pulling some booths away from the window.  

I've always had a good experience at Jason's Deli.  It's a good place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"The food is good, tho overpriced.  The non baked chips are pathetic, I got bottom of the bag half chips, even after asking for intact chips.  That's weak. Also, the Yelp app sucks, it nags constantly for reviews. The floor was a big mess, something nasty spilled, and the cleanup was half done, so the floor is still nasty and sticky. My poor shoes! It will be a while before I return, only if my coworkers twist my arm.

Review changed from 3 to 2 because the manager was apathetic and less than concerned about the less than intact chip/crumbs."}
{"text":"Met my bestie across town last week for the second time at this Jasons Deli. This time it was very busy. The employees worked fast and the restaurant and bathrooms were clean. They kept the drink station and salad bar cleaned up during the rush. The staff checked on us to see if we needed anything a few times which is always appreciated. They even brought us a to go box for my daughters cheese pizza. I wish they had Ceaser dressing on the salad bar. Although they might carry it in packets behind the counter but I didn't ask.  I am disappointed with the high pricing. I can get a lot more choices from Sweet Tomatoes at a better price and it's even cheaper with coupons. Plenty of parking in between several businesses/restaurants."}
{"text":"Wraps and sandwiches aren't bad, but they aren't best either. Soup and Salads that my gf had were pretty bad. I would recommend going to Great American Food on Jones, if you are craving delicious sandwiches."}
{"text":"I have been here 2 days in a row! The California Club is tasty,  the guacamole is the freshest.  I had the Irish Potato soup and will definitely have it again in the future. The salad bar is a great value with fresh ingredients.  They also offer free soft serve as an extra perk.  I found a new favorite."}
{"text":"Food is good, but I will never again spend a dime in that place. I called to make an order for delivery when I was informed by the girl on the phone that they have a $25 minimum and a $7 delivery fee!!!!!! Are they kidding? That is insane, the food is good, but not that good. Curious if anyone in charge knows anything about business, delivery can be a huge money maker. Most other places have a $10 min and a $2 - $3 delivery charge."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in Jason's Deli.  Their sandwiches are so small yet they charge you a price that is 2X what it should be given the portion.  They also forgot a sandwich in our take out order; that's understandable.  The portions are laughable.  One person in our office had to order 2 sandwiches for $20 just to be satisfied."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with Jason's deli! Absolutely love their Chicago club sandwich, with baked chips of course! Whenever I dine in I always get the fresh salad bar. Sometimes when I'm under the weather I'll switch it up and get a hot soup! Staff is always friendly. And free ice cream when you dine in as well."}
{"text":"I am normally a big fan of Jason's Deli, and have frequented multiple locations in other states. I do like the selection and the relatively healthy 'fast food' options, but this location is just OK. The dining area always seems like it could be a little tidier/cleaner, and the food (to order) has always left quite a bit to be desired."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and service, and very very clean and friendly.  Really great prices. I go for the salad bar, tomato soup, cheese sandwiches, baked potato, and macaroni & cheese. 

Very kid friendly menu."}
{"text":"Always good food and consistent!!! I love the soup and deserts! The service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Dirty place, imagine you are eating and a lady comes by with a dish cart then starts scraping the food into another bin. I don't quite understand the use of the word Deli, I am not quite sure how to title this, hospital cafeteria maybe? Had a turkey wrap (which was tiny) was skeptical on the corned beef... for the wrap they used processed meat that had a shine to it. Pass on this place. Maybe the owners should visit a Miltons or a Jerrys deli before they attempt this."}
{"text":"What's there not to love about JD's?! Seriously, anyone can find something they love here. I've tried just about everything on the menu, and nothing disappoints. My favorites would have to probably be the Sante Fe Chicken sandwhich or the Papa Joe. I work in Uptown, so this is a crowd-pleaser amongst all of my co-workers. 

I usually grab the 'Manager's Special' which is a 1/2 & 1/2 deal. I get 1/2 a sandwhich, a cup of soup AND a side (chips, steamed veggies, ect). What a great deal. AND YOU GET FREE ICE CREAM! The child in me rejoices anytime someone says they want to grab lunch here."}
{"text":"I love Jason's Deli.  The best thing to get as far as I'm concerned is the Manager Special.  A half sandwich and one trip to the salad bar.  The sandwiches are great.  I have tried serval.  All the breads are fresh and flavorful.  The ingredients are fresh and taste amazing.  The thing to go for is the salad bar.  Everything is always stocked and fresh.  If something runs out give it a minute or ask.  It will be refilled.  An awesome benefit is the free soft serve.  Given the price this place is very exceptional.  The price is quite inexpensive, especially for the quality."}
{"text":"Well done Jason's Deli, well done! 

Stopped in for lunch today, and it actually was busy inside but not overwhelming! I was able to order right away and decided to attempt to get a \"healthy\" lunch so I ordered the Ranchero Chicken Wrap to go...it comes with in an organic wheat wrap and blue chips and salsa...so in my book that's healthy enough for me! 

BUT...what made the trip so awesome was that while I was waiting for them to prepare my wrap the manager came out from behind the counter and said it wouldn't be a long  but to help myself to an ice cream cone while I waited....can you say WINNING!!! 

But now on to the wrap...

When I first unwrapped it, I wasn't very impressed with how it looked but once I tasted it all those thoughts were pushed aside. The wrap comes in a wheat wrap with grilled chicken breast, cheddar cheese ,jalapeños, pico de gallo, some southwest spices and ranch dressing. The  jalapeños added a nice little kick, but they weren't overpowering. I couldn't really taste the southwest spices perhaps they were overpowered by the ranch dressing but unlike most people I'm a fan of ranch dressing ( I know it's a lot of calories but its so delicious I digress) 

The blue chips were good but the salsa was delicious! It tasted VERY fresh. It was so good, I added some of the my wrap....YUMMY!

Overall, I was very impressed....enjoyed my lunch and the ice cream cone....will I be back....of course!"}
{"text":"We walked from downtown, 15 minutes, with the idea of taking a cab back, but after a huge Ruben, we couldn't fit in the car. The walk served us well. Very good food and portions. Service was great, and friendly, with knowledgeable staff. Like Paul said, try to avoid the lunch hour. Everyone in the building eats there and it is packed."}
{"text":"Man, this place was da bomb.com. I have to take a dump cause this place is like so so def wit that fresh fresh salat. keeps me rugalurrr as heyaaalllll!!
No, but really this place is great. The ice cream is a wonderful suprise at the end. I would give it 5 stars but it didn't have sprinkles.

{"text":"I wish I had something positive to to review about Jason's deli. I can't believe that chicken salad has progressed to the point where someone thought it was a good idea to put pineapple in the mix. What a terrible idea. Chicken salad is chicken salad it's not supposed to be some moment where you get creative and add some kind of fruit into the recipe. Just terrible. How you're still in business with these idiotic additions to something that could be very natural and taste good, and then ruined by adding pineapple, seriously pineapple? The bread used was only par compared to other delis that I have been to. First time eater and will not be back nor will I tell anyone else to go and eat at any of your locations as I have also tried other sandwiches with different bread and it was still sub par. Fail"}
{"text":"Do not go here on a date!  It's nice for lunch most any day of the week.  Think Camille's.  But for dinner on weeknights in particular, families with kids tend to overrun the place and the food quality isn't as good.  

Remember how much fun the petting zoo was when you were 7 years old?  Somehow Jason's Deli has recreated that same atmosphere in their dining room.  Great for kids.  Not great for couples trying to enjoy each other's company."}
{"text":"Stopped in Vegas on our way home to San Diego but didn't want to deal with a casino. Jason's was a perfect choice! 5 min off the freeway. Huge sandwiches, fresh, natural foods, yummy soups, salad bar and a free soft serve cone for everyone!  I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants, but Jason's is an exception."}
{"text":"For me, Jason's Deli is a solid Las Vegas stand-by. It's probably the only \"go to the counter and order\" establishment that I'm really comfortable with. The staff is always friendly and helpful and this time around the manager helped us with the menu. I love this place. Walk in the door, file through the line, order your food, get a number,  go to your seat, delivery. Soups, salads, a full salad bar, sandwiches. Yeah. This is it.

I was going to go with something simple here, like the salad bar, but after a long day and just discovering that our flight is delayed 2 hours, I decided on something better than just a salad, but the all you can eat salad bar would have been awesome. Where can you get an all you can eat salad bar these days for $7.59? I knew we were going to be hanging out for awhile so I got what I wanted. One thing I really hate though is when the online menu doesn't reflect the current menu at the store.

Anyway, all that aside, I love the place and I loved my wild salmon sandwich on gluten-free bread. The bread was actually pretty good and managed to stay in one piece. The salmon was generous in portion and made this sammy worth every penny.

I've been in 2 Jason's Delis and they have a great well thought out floor plan here. It's cavernous with plenty of seating, though they could stand for more booths. The only ones I could see are by the windows but no matter. There were plenty available. If I were still living in Las Vegas/Green Valley, I would be a regular here, no doubt."}
{"text":"This is such a friendly place and environment. Food is spectacular. Service is amazing. The salad bar is neatly set up and easily accessible for being a pregnant woman with a big belly. Price is perfect the amount of food you get and the quality. Everything was in order and very clean."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo good !!! It's my first time going here abd had to leave a 5 star !! The deli is very clean. The food is amazing. Beats paradise bakery 100 times. I ordered the cranberry smoked turkey with tomato basil soup. Amazing !!  The employees are super friendly. I love sandwiches and soups for lunch. So glad I found this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late dinner and Evan was GREAT!  I appreciate the hospitality being my first time here.  The tuna salad on a buttery croissant was delicious.  I also would recommend the french onion and the giant potato."}
{"text":"disgusting.  i'm here right now and it smells horrible, like urine. note to jasons deli: clean your bathrooms thoroughly. if you have tables (8 tables) near the restroom, remember......people are eating and dont want to smell pee!"}
{"text":"Slowest...service...ever. Took about 30 minutes to get our food when it was basically dead in there."}
{"text":"This was the first time in a long time that I actually ordered the soup and sandwich.  I got a coke and the machine doused me with soda by spraying all over the place. Other people were having the same problem. Got my potato soup and it was cold.  The cheese on top wouldn't even melt.  My tuna sandwiches was tasteless.  The bread was toasted and the tuna had eggs in it.  There was no flavor to it. I could make this bad of a tuna sandwich at home. That's why I don't eat tuna sandwiches at home I'm not good at it.  When I come here I'll just stick to the salad bar where if I don't make it right it would be my own fault."}
{"text":"It has been a couple years since I last ate at this Jason's Deli, and, today, it was a big disappointment.  I ordered the pastrami sandwich on an onion bun w/Swiss cheese.  The bun was very small and the serving of pastrami was half the amount that I normally used to receive and the pastrami was luke warm & dry.  The sandwich came with the about 10 potatoes chips that were in very small pieces.  The was no pickle, either.  They offer no substitutions for the potatoes chips.  For $8.99, I received a $4 sandwich.  There were no condiments on the tables to add to the sandwich.  This Jason's does not hold a candle to Miracle Mile.  Cashier's were not friendly at all."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli is an inexpensive restaurant my wife and I love to eat at for lunch or dinner. Their salad bar is perfect for us and we will surely come back again and again.

The only part I don't like about their all you can eat salad bar is that I have go to the counter to ask for a plate exchange. This requirement is so that you use a clean plate for each visit to the salad bar. I feel slightly guilty when I ask for new plate more than once."}
{"text":"Unlimited pickles have arrived at jason's. The solo, lonely pickle on the plate has been abolished and now all sandwich ordering patrons can load up on pickles at the salad bar. They are decent pickles with a good crunch. Just imagine if every sandwich you ate in your lifetime came with unlimited pickles, how many per sandwich would you eat? I downed 7 of them with my $6.99 Papa Joe. The sandwich was turkey with roma tomato and pesto aioli and was good, despite being small as it was shoved onto a square of Herb Foccica bread about toilet paper size. There are places with better turkey around, so unless you love pickles, this chain will only be necessary when in a bind. Salad bar is good too on a previous visit, but just throw some chicken or protein on the thing and stop nicle and diming us for everything up there (pickles was just a start)."}
{"text":"Solid deli food, but I somehow always leave feeling hungry. The free ice cream doesn't hurt, though."}
{"text":"It was our first time at a Jason's deli.  Walking in, we were greeted and they gave us take out menus, which was a good thing, because for some reason on their menu board they only have about 1/4 of the items they serve there, which I thought was very odd.  Me and my wife both got half sandwiches and one trip to the salad bar.  Our son got bowtie pasta and meatballs.  Service was fast, by the time my wife watched our son and I got the salad bar, our food was already at the table, and she hadn't even had a chance to get her salad yet.  

The salad bar was fine, it was about similar to what you'd expect from Eat N Park, but soup is sold separately.  My main complaint with it was, there was NO french dressing.  They had an adequate selection of dressings, but not french.  I settled for 1000 Island, but kind of regretted it after I did since I have to be in the mood for it.  Also, the one trip to the salad bar is kind of annoying.  More so because if you want potato salad, cole slaw, etc., you gotta stack it all together on the plate and it all gets mixed in to your salad.  They even had pudding up there, which looked untouched, because I don't think anyone in their right mind would even chance having pudding mix in with the salad.

I got the reuben sandwich.  It was good and meaty, but they put about an equal amount of sauerkraut on there as they did meat.  I've never seen so much sauerkraut on a sandwich, so I had to scrape off about 75% of it to make it like a normal reuben.  The corn beef was awesome though.  Probably some of the best I've ever had.  They also screwed up and gave me Salt and Vinegar chips instead of BBQ.  I didn't even complain because I wasn't hungry enough to eat them anyway after the salad and sandwich, which was plenty of food.  My sons pasta was kind of bleh.  Not that it wasn't edible, but you can make better tasting pasta out of a box at home.  It was a nice option for him, because he's not a sandwich eater, but he'll eat pasta all day every day.

At the end of your meal, they give you free ice cream.  We would not have known about it though, except they told the people in front of us, and I overheard them, but they didn't inform us about it.  

Overall, the service was good, everyone was friendly and made sure we were happy, and the food was reasonably good.  I'm sure I'd go back if I was ever up that way and was hungry for a sandwich, but I wouldn't make a special trip there again like I did today."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on a Tuesday night. Bad idea. I was quoted an hour. fine, sure. An hour and a half later, I call to see if it's on its way. I'm told it is. Two hours later, I call again. it's still not here. First off, there's no way my food would even still be warm, let alone hot. I live less than five minutes away. I canceled the order and was put on hold to wait for a manager only to tell me the driver was almost there. Sorry, I'm not about to pay for cold food. Two hours, absolutely unacceptable. this isn't the first time but I like to give people the benefit of the doubt. This will however most definitely be the last time."}
{"text":"Ok this was my first time eating at Jason's Deli location. Usually i have had their food because they deliver food at my job for meetings etc.
They have a variety of sandwiches, soups, salads and pasta dishes. My husband and I got the same thing in which is the same thing i get when they deliver 'Caprese Sandwich' baked chips and a drink.  The one that took our order was nice. We headed to fill our drinks in which it needed cleaning couldnt put the cup down to put the lid on without getting stuff on the bottom of cup.
Then we tried to find a place to sit. There was only 2 groups of people sitting and no one at the register and All the table were filthy!!!! They had a cluster of chairs in the middle of room amongst tables, the floors had papers on them it was gross i was ready to leave! My husband found one table close to the cluster of chairs that was clean. 
We waited about 15 min and they brought out our food! It was really good. My husband was impressed. 
Then we were ready to go and we decided to refill our drinks since we did pay $2.09 ea lol. While we were there we noticed they offer free ice cream! They have cones and chocolate, swirl or vanilla.. Yum but NO!! They have a container right below the dispensing of ice cream filled with ice cream cones and who knows its gross!!!!
Cant say i will be back and I cant say if I will tell my company to stop ordering from them. The food is great but if it is this filthy in the front how is it where they prepare the food?"}
{"text":"At first, I wasn't too excited to try this  deli. I don't consider salads and sandwiches as filing. I came with my friend and ordered the California Club, which came with a side of fruit (my pick). The sandwich did not disappoint me! It was a good portion and it was delicious. The fruits were fresh and it came with a refreshing sweet yogurt like sauce which helped the tartness of the fruits. I will definitely be coming back. And the staff were extremely friendly. 

FYI: free ice cream and they have hot peppers!!!"}
{"text":"My company got this catered to us, their breakfast stuff is pretty good! We had the meat breakfast wraps and the vegetarian ones. Both were super tasty and I enjoyed getting this catered to us for a hot breakfast meal!"}
{"text":"Great salad bar, fancy sandwiches, and surprisingly upscale \"healthy\" food for a deli- location is frequently busy but has a large dining room to accommodate their large crowds of customers. If ordering to-go, they offer online and phone-in orders with a  separate counter entirely for takeout meals, which makes things go quicker.

They have about eight soups, most of which are fairly good but unfortunately they run out of some pretty frequently- last two times I've been, the broccoli cheese and tomato basil were both out. Less-common picks like the seafood gumbo are pretty solid, if a little heavy on the salt.

They have a soft-serve cone station for the dine-in salad bar participants, but I'd rather splurge on dishes like their salmon or chicken Veracruz if I want something hearty. Lots of options here. Maybe steer clear of the stuffed baked potatoes unless you're planning to split them among an entire family- they're enormous."}
{"text":"Jason's is awesome!  My husband and I tried this place for the first time for lunch the other day and we both walked away full and happy!  I can't wait to go back and try the yummy looking salad bar or one of their many daily soups or delicious sounding potatoes or just get another Ranchero Wrap! (loved the blue corn tortilla chips and fresh salsa too)

*Super fresh ingredients and generous portions
*Awesome service without trying too hard
*Great menu - there's something for EVERYONE here
*FREE ice cream!
*Convenient location, easy to get in and out, large, open dining room"}
{"text":"When I read about the screaming children at the Madison location in another Yelp review, I was decidedly leery about trying this place. But being hungry after seeing a movie at Marcus Point down the street, my feet found their way to Jason's Deli's door, so I thought I would give them a chance. Even though it was around 12:30, the place wasn't too crowded for a Friday and the customer base had a definite adult slant. I ordered the Chicken Club Salad which I wasn't wild about, as it had too much white lettuce and not enough green to suit me. Next time, I will definitely be hitting up the salad bar and probably trying the soup. JD has nice touches that makes it far above the usual fast food place, what with the complimentary soft serve ice cream and mini-muffins. The manager said that his favorite were the gingerbread and I could understand why. Yum! The plentiful and bustling staff kept the restaurant clean and well stocked. The ordering and the stations were easy to follow and the staff was personable. I would say you just have to know what to order to make it a perfect experience. An add bonus are the outdoor seating during the warm months."}
{"text":"I am here a minimum of once a week, best chicken noodle soup ever.Great sandwiches and salads, salad bar rocks, and the complimentary yogurt / ice cream is a nice touch.Lunch crowd can be huge but take that as a good sign,  I always do."}
{"text":"Salad bar salad bar SALAD BAR!! Ohhhh and free ice cream!! Do I need to say more?? It's a basic salad bar. Ohhh nothing supper fancy or overly large but CLEAN  and a good amount of selection. You could make multiple trips without having the same thing twice- but who could pass up banana pudding?  Pickles are always a must and boiled eggs are left whole (I like that vs smashed to hell and crap all in it) I tried the \"new\" and suggested items that are labeled on the glass. Cucumber dill dressing was to die for... I normally like Greek or French (will even settle for basic ranch) but this is a good flavor and made me want more. I love the fruit and yogurt options. Also the basil tomato and cheese mix was very satisfying. My friend had the pastrami sandwich that was loaded w meat and a salad. He swears by the thousand island but I'm not a fan so I wouldn't try it. He let me know before work he likes to come here and order the salad bar to go- it's $8 and he loads up! Compared to paying for salad bar to-go pricing it's a deal. 
If I could suggest a drink 1/3 sweet tea and 2/3 lemonade!! Sooo good!!"}
{"text":"Took forever for my chicken noodle to come, my husband had to get it himself. It was just sitting in the counter and when I tried it i was cold...IM SO MAD RIGHT NOW NEVER COMING BACK YO THIS PLACE EVER..oh yeah the last time I ordered something to go here my husband almost died from choking because there was like a bone or a toothpick in his Santa Fe chicken"}
{"text":"My family and I came to Jason's Deli because she was referred to it. 

I will not come to this place again. The food was disgusting. Messed up my whole night. 

The only reason why I am giving it 2 stars is because the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Been awhile, but had a good lunch the other day. If you sign up for birthday club, your meal will cost $5 less. The quarter muffaletta seems like it's always my choice here with layers of cheese, turkey and olive mix. For a buck more, you can add a one time trip to the salad bar. In this case the food runner suggested I get my salad bar to go due to the size of the sandwich and it was great advice. They give you a decent sized to-go container and boom, you have dinner for a buck. The salad bar was full of all the usual stuff, but the pasta, mini muffins and garlic toast are also there for the taking. The total price was like 8 bucks for two meals, so good food and value as well."}
{"text":"Great food! I do wish they had really good desserts though. I come here all the time either way."}
{"text":"Layout of the place was a bit confusing when I first got there on my first time, since I was trying to take an order to go, but didn't know where to go..
I ended up in the line 'for here', but they were patient enough with me to explain which area was for take-out, how I can create my own salads to go (awesome idea), and what sandwiches they offer. 

The Rueben sandwich had perfectly, thin-sliced meat piled high, with plenty of sauerkraut mushed in between fresh slices of bread. Sweet sweet aroma. It was nice to go down the salad bar and choose what ever toppings I wanted..plenty of variety and the whole boiled eggs are something that I haven't seen at other salad bars. Everything is really fresh, and is very similar to a sanwich shop back in CA (called Erik's deli) for those who know what I'm talking about. But sandwiches are a bit bigger here. Bit pricey but beats me making a sandwich when I get lazy."}
{"text":"While this place isn't spectacular it's perfect at being what it's designed for: fast and delicious. I always get the manager's special of the half sandwich and salad bar, it's never let me down and it's consistently great. The salad bar has a great selection and even though I've graduated to the point where I eat bleu cheese over ranch this is literally the only place I get ranch, it's that good. The sandwiches never let me down either. All in all this place hits the spot and I always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Worst customer service! I walked in here and instead of taking my order they started helping others that were standing around the register area. There is no organization here, it is like a zoo! I highly suggest you get ready to fight your way to the register, and after you get there you will have to deal with the rude manager named Ashley! Good Luck and make sure to pack ur lunch before going here or you might starve."}
{"text":"I've visited a couple of different Jason's deli and found that they were a little different from your typical deli's. There is a lot of varieties in their menu which was refreshing. The prices are OK. What impressed me most was the service. The manager went out of her way to do a couple of nice things for us which impressed me greatly. 

The location of this restaurant is far from the strip so most of the customers were local. The strip mall is a little seedy so beware where you park your car."}
{"text":"Been coming to Jason's since they had a location across the street from PV Mall back in the early 90's. Their restaurants are always pretty decent and the food is tasty good. This location on Shea appears to have had a remodel since we were here last time and the inside looks really nice.

The menu has changed a bit over the years and is smaller than I remember. They used to have a larger selection of stuffed potatoes and now only have a few. My favorite was a smokey BBQ Beef stuffed potato with tons of other goodies. I think you could even build your own at one time.

The wife and I usually go with the famous New Orleans 9\" FULL size Ham and Salami Muffaletta. It is hard to resist some additional Olive spread on the side and a little hot sauce to kick things up a notch. The sandwich is giant and we normally have a good portion to bring home for a snack later.

There are plenty of other options that are also fresh and tasty. Cool all you can eat Salad Bar to indulge yourself. Yummy Soups, maybe a bowl of Chili, as well as Wraps and Pasta if you desire. They also have a nice Kid's menu with the typical favorites for the little ones.

Friendly service and a casually comfortable eating area. Catering and Delivery also available. Don't forget to enjoy some FREE soft serve Ice Cream with a squirt of dark chocolate syrup before you leave. SCORE!"}
{"text":"Good deli sandwiches. Moist bread, fresh ingredients, great flavor. It's better then your average deli, but ultimately it's never going to be the most amazing food. However; it's above par for a deli.

Plus, free ice cream?! How can you go wrong with that?"}
{"text":"Poorly priced, food often tastes like stuff I could cook at home. Service is bad and very unfriendly. Usually pretty messy and disorganized. The salad bar is one of the most expensive items on the menu which doesn't make too much sense. But one star for the ice cream."}
{"text":"We stopped there yesterday the 10th. I was really looking forward to one of their barely fits in your mouth hot pastrami sandwich's. My wife ordered a salad, and I ordered 1/2 of a hot pastrami sandwich (because they were huge) and a cup of their broccoli cheddar soup. We went outside to their patio because the interior was hot, noisy and had some strange essence. 

The buss crew must have had the day off because there were many interior tables that needed to be cleaned and on their patio of the 7 tables only two were clean.

My 1/2 sandwich and chips eventually arrived and I asked where my soup was? The person who brought my sandwich said she would go check. It never arrived via anyone from Jason's. 

However when my wife went back for seconds at the salad bar she spotted my cup of soup sitting where the completed food orders are. She brought it back with her on the return from the salad bar. 

The sandwich was a huge disappointment. If Clara Peller had been there she would have exclaimed \"Where's the meat?\". Previous pastrami or corned beef sandwiches were always packed with so much meat you could hardly bite into them. This one was devoid of any pretense of meat. What was there barely made a bump between the two pieces of rye bread. What was there was delicious but the expectations based on prior visits was a complete letdown. The cup of soup was still warm, aided mostly by the congealed cheddar at the top. The skin helped hold the heat in and once cleared of the skin the soup was very good. 

Past favorable visits to this Jason's brought us there on Saturday. The poor excuse of a sandwich, the failure to bring my soup, the lack of cleanliness and the attitude of the staff sealed the deal for us. While others have left glowing reviews, ours will not be one of them. 
There are too many deli alternatives out there meaning Jason's will not be one of them."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Picked up a late dinner. Hubby was happy with his sandwich, but salad wasn't so good. Dressing wasn't \"on the side\" as promised, or anywhere at all. Very little flavor. I'll let hubby get his meal there next time and go somewhere else for me."}
{"text":"I drove past this place a few times and never gave it much thought. 

I was pleasantly surprised when I finally went inside and discovered a fairly large and pleasant restaurant. 

I got the Sergeant Pepper sandwich - very tasty. You get a lot of good food for a very cheap price. 

I'm a fan."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best.  We had a Rueben and a Tuna Melt.  The Tuna melt was actually toast with Tuna.  Serious lack of technique in regard to creating a \"melt\" type sandwich.  The pastrami was more akin to roast beef with little in the way of Pastrami like flavors.  Finally the sandwiches themselves we're very tepid in terms of temperature, maybe that was because it took nearly 25 minutes from order to food delivery.  (Really 20+ minutes for a sandwich?)  Finally the staff was not particularly friendly, while not horrible a good afternoon and smile is not too much to asked.  It seemed they were as disappointed at being as my visit turned out to be.  
Maybe we just didn't have the right things but it seems like there are other deli's around that can hit the basics more effectively than Jason's"}
{"text":"The first time I came here it was prime lunchtime on a weekend and it was crazy...the line was out the door.

Then I came at lunchtime during the week about a year later and it was dead. Anyway, I always hear people talking about it like it's the bee's knees, but I think it's just ok.

You order at the counter, pay at the counter and they bring it out to your table. Pretty fast about it, too, so it's do-able for a work lunch. they have a salad bar that may or not be included in every order... i couldn't tell. There are also outside tables."}
{"text":"Tried Jason deli for the first time and was a bit disappointed. 

-pastrami sandwich on French roll with mustard: first off the meat was a bit tasteless and wasn't even that warm even though I got it toasted.  Bread seemed ok... 

Will probably give it another shot with a different sandwich. 

Worker was helpful and service seemed good. Establishment was clean and plenty of seating. 

The free ice cream wasn't bad though."}
{"text":"Jasons Deli for a meal? Don't order anything with tomato in it. Yes now I remember about the tomato salmonella; but they will let you order anything and not remind you they're no tomatoes. How about a BLT with no tomato? That's one dry sandwich! They made it right but not until I had to complain."}
{"text":"I love the food here but what I love the most are the people who work here. The employees are very great customer service providers and they thrive to go out of their way to be friendly. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Two times in a row they have left things out of my online orders that I pick up in person.  This is unacceptable, McDonald's has better service for half the price!  Also annoying how they make you show IDs and credit cards plus sign paper receipts for online orders that were already processed.  The new credit card laws do not require signatures for orders under $50 now.  They also should remove the tip line as this is not a full service restaurant and you should not feel obligated to tip."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli on Centrum Parkway is always busy at lunch.  I have always eaten at their salad bar, which is actually quite tiny.  For a salad buffet, Souper Salad offers significantly more salad toppings and additional buffet options at a similar price.  I feel like I never get my money's worth at Jason's, though the salads there are tasty and nutritious."}
{"text":"When I'm in Charlotte on business I eat at Jason's Deli at least once a day. They make fresh, full and delicious sandwiches but I've become most fond of the Rubens.  Best Rubens I've had outside of NYC. The staff is professional, polite, and very hard working. They also have an amplely stocked salad bar and all the sweet tea you can drink."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for lunch!! Went for lunch today with my roomie. She had the beef stew.. tasted it and it was really flavorful and beefy. I had the light club sandwich which had a hearty portion of turkey and ham on it, with side of fresh fruit that's served with a sweet delicious yogurt and a cup of the vegetarian vegetable soup. Soup was ok- I usually get the chicken pot pie soup which is absolute bliss. But I have to say I was sooo impressed by the FRUIT!!! It was the freshest I've ever had in a deli restaurant ever!!! Melon and cantaloupe yumm but the strawberries!!! Unbelievably sweet strawberries!!! OMG who is their produce buyer??? It was AMAZING! :D

This review is like super old compare to the date i posted it!! haha Like from 2011!! ;P"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Jason's Deli elsewhere in the country and state (it's a popular 'safe' dining location), and this one is pretty typical.

  The food is pretty decent, nothing great, but for soup and sandwich it's not bad. The free soft serve and muffins are a nice perk.

  I wish the employees here were as enthusiastic as the ones in Shea though. Maybe I'm always dealing with the manager there or something, but eating here was a bit of a disappointment to me, honestly, in that regard.

  Perfectly acceptable, not a bad place for an evening meal with a group, when you want someplace no one is going to have issue with."}
{"text":"Vegan options, fresh, nice staff, etc and congrats JD DT you are a lead to follow for the other JD's in town and I hope it continues to improve."}
{"text":"I love the chicken pot pie bowls the best!"}
{"text":"I love this place

It would be helpful that I stop eating out and cook but due to the summer heat- I prefer to eat out...

This is one of my many favorite place- i love the sandwiches as well as the salad bar."}
{"text":"Great place to grab quick lunch, friendly staff and food always tastes fresh. My only complain is that the prices keep climbing for to go orders. At first it was $4.99 for a salad, then $6.50 and now its $9.60 which is pretty steep considering what you get. I will still go there, but get my salads elsewhere"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch a lot and it's always been good. I always get the same thing, the club lite and it's amazing. The fruit is always good and I'm such a huge fan of the ginger bead mini muffins. If you take the time to do the survey on your receipt, you can get a free cookie on the next visit. The prices are ok, the service is great and the food is probably the healthiest I eat."}
{"text":"Good.solid everytime love the soups wish the salads were bigger really skimps on lettuce"}
{"text":"Everything taste watered down at this location this is my favorite restaurant and this location is idk like they trying to save money adding extra water to everything...lemonade taste like water lobster bisque had way too much water in it...I'm not impressed with this location"}
{"text":"They can't be blamed for panhandlers(it's Maryland pkwy near campus) nor the lady in front of me bickering over whether some item was 4 or 5 dollars some time ago; but they can be for a bowl of lettuce, sandwich meat and cheese which I believe is some farce of a chef salad.  To add insult to injury, I believe I paid over 7 dollars for it, although you'll catch me dead before you see me in line arguing about it.  There are plenty of tables open here though, and the food followed me to the table (once the lady resolved to speak to the manager)."}
{"text":"Came here for the New Yorker (corned beef/pastrami ) sandwich. Asked for horseradish & was told they no longer carry. What?!!  A DELI with no horseradish?"}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to the area a little over a week ago and have already been to Jason's twice. The food is wonderful and brought to you quickly and we've never had to wait in line to order, even when going during a lunch hour. The free ice cream is an added perk! We will definitely continue to eat here."}
{"text":"Jason's deli has a really great self-serve salad bar.  I won't rate the sandwiches, because even though I've been here over 10 times, I only have got the salad bar because I like it so much!

Tip: If you just want the salad bar, skip the lines at the front of the store and go to the self serve payment kiosk by the salad bar and pay there and get your salad plate pronto.   

Ok, on to the salad bar.  It is always fresh and clean even when they are packed.  There is a great variety of items, and they don't cheap out on the good stuff.  Olives, cheese, cottage cheese, oranges, apples, nuts, and of course all the other standard salad bar fare.

If you want to order soup you can get that for extra.  If you want more protein you can order a side of chicken or salmon too.  However, i haven't been impressed with the chicken or salmon quality for the extra price ($4-$6 extra I believe).  If you order salad bar, soup, drink, and a side of meat your meal is suddenly pretty expensive.

The little muffins you can get are awesome too!  For dessert there is a ice cream machine (ice milk really) to make ice cream cones or ice cream bowls.  Nothing fancy, but it works for a nice treat.

In the end, I always leave satisfied and full."}
{"text":"I typically order online and pick up food here to go. My food is always ready on time! The broccoli cheddar soup is fantastic. Also a big fan of the Club Royale. The 1/2 sandwich 1/2 soup combo is perfectly portioned for lunch. Plus there is a self-serve ice cream machine with chocolate, vanilla, and chocolate vanilla swirl. Great variety of options on the menu."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! The service is great and the environment is a very welcoming and warm to have lunch with friends. I ordered the taco salad - delicious! I like how they also give you the option of a lighter portion. They were very accommodating with my specific requests (sour cream and cheese on the side, light salsa) and our orders were brought out promptly. They also give you free ice cream on your first visit. Overall, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Tonight while looking for somewhere to have dinner my boyfriend and I ended up at a crossroads. We pulled into a strip mall on Warm Springs across from sunset station and found ourselves stuck btwn 3 delicious options; Napoli pizza, The Great Greek or Jason's Deli. Knowing if we went to Napolis I would  eat wayyy to much greasy pizza and hate myself after, and having had Greek food the night before we settled with Jason's. 

It was almost 830 by the time we got inside and noticed they closed at 9. The employees were friendly and didn't seem bothered by our late arrival. My bf decided on the beefeater sandwich which is essentially a French dip, and I the salad bar. The nice cashier who rang us up gave us soft drinks for free. +1 star for that. The salad bar looked fresh and clean. The veggies were crisp and the dressings tasted homemade. Besides your standard salad bar offerings they also had a few potato salads, pasta salad and puddings. As well as various mini muffins, crackers and bread. They also have soft serve ice cream for dessert. I got to have a bite of the beefeater and it was good. It came piled high with lots of roast beef, melty cheese and a side of au jus. It was nothing special but it was definitely a big filling sandwich for around $8.50. Good service good food good price. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My favorite for salad bar. Mostly healthy options so I'm not as tempted by some of the larger salad chains that include all you can eat soups, pastas and other not so good for you options. My husband loves the variety of sandwiches available. My daughter enjoys the chicken nuggets. Ice cream is everyone's favorite. This location used to have some kind of soft serve that was very artificial looking/tasting, but they have since upgraded to the real stuff and I am so happy they did! We go here at least 1-2x a month."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy eating here. My last visit though left me disappointed to where I may not return. 

My boyfriend and I came in Sunday about 6:30. We decided on the salad bar and a bowl of chili for me, and a sandwich and baked potato for him. I spent around $27. I got my salad plate and went over to the salad bar. I started making my salad, but found many of the toppings were low or out completely. No big deal, I just went and told the manager and she said someone would fill them up. This is not what happened though. I watched her walk over to the salad bar, look in some of the containers, and then to the back and bring out metal covers and place them over the items that were empty, then walk to the back not saying a word to me.

So my boyfriend goes up to another employee and asks wtf? He would have asked the manager, but she is now hiding in the back. Not very manager-like if you ask me. Anyway this girl goes and talks to the mgr for a minute and then comes to our table. She tells us they are out of many items because they had a large party the day before and pretty much wiped them out of a lot of items. Plus their delivery had not come in yet. Things like tomatoes, bell peppers, bacon, eggs and cheese, even croutons! All my favorite fixings for a yummy salad.

Here's the thing, I wouldn't have ordered the salad had someone told me this before. Considering that was my main meal, it should have been mentioned not just to me, but to everyone that ordered the salad bar. That, and the fact that the manager was hiding from us was a little irritating. We asked for a refund and went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Jasons deli is really awesome i rarely eat outside the box but i always try a new sandwhich at Jasons! Every sandwhich is so good and made just how i like it. The resteraunt is clean, in a nice location, and the people there are really friendly."}
{"text":"Went to Jason's today for a salad.  I ordered the taco salad and expected a green salad with a bit of meat, beans, and salsa.  What I got was a bowl with blue corn chips and a huge scoop of chicken chili and a few lettuce leaves.  No way in hell should this be called a salad!"}
{"text":"Simple, healthy, and affordable.

Looking for something healthy to grab a quick bite. Well here you go. Jason's Deli has soups, salad bar, hot and cold sandwiches, and wraps to offer. Oh, I'm forgetting pastas. 
Look through the menu, order, pay the cashier, get a number, find a seat, and they'll bring the food to you. After a weekend of partying and barely having healthy options to eat, we found our way off the strip near the \"ghetto side\" of Vegas to a large plaza where Jason's Deli sits. I had the Mediterranean wrap with a side of steamed veggies. I enjoyed it, but the olives were too salty. Great eats before a long drive home to LA.


Cheers."}
{"text":"I have been to this Jasons Deli several times, it has always been good.  We have ordered delivery from here several times, it has always been very delicious.  I ordered delivery from here today, and it was very forgetable.  The butter croissant that held my turkey sandwich together was really dried out, it was actually breaking as I ate it, it was that dry.  I have said before that they have the best brownies I have ever had....... Just not today. The brownies were overcooked,  one of them actually tasted burned.... they were very dry, not moist and fudgy the way they have been, when I have had them before.  Everything was disappointing about this meal...... it might be awhile before I order from here again."}
{"text":"We had never heard of Jason's Deli until we went on a kayaking trip and the company provided catered sandwiches from here. We loved our sandwiches so much that day that we made a point to find one for lunch while we were in town. 

This location was slammed when we got there (right at peak lunch time during the week). It was a little dirty and they could have used a couple more employees on the floor to keep up with the clean up. 

Despite that, the food was excellent. We both had the California Club. The turkey and bacon were delicious and high quality. The produce on the sandwich was very fresh. I had fruit as a side and my husband had the blue corn tortilla chips and salsa, which he loved. 

They also give out free mini muffins and soft serve to go with your meal, which is a nice little perk. I wish there was a Jason's Deli closer to home!"}
{"text":"About a week ago my bf and I came here for lunch just right before starting our drive back to LA. We stayed at the Ramada  and this was just right across the parking lot...so instead of searching where to eat, we just settled for this. 

I ordered their Deli Club - it was pretty massive - I like how they served it on whole grain wheat w/o having me to order it differently. I had the potato salad as the side - which was good but the mustard was somewhat overwhelming. The sandwich was good but it was so big I couldn't even finish it. 

Bf ordered the Wild Salmon-wich with a side of fruits. Looked pretty good and according to him it was delicious.  

Nice place for lunch, looking at their menu I kind of wish they would have one over in Orange County or Irvine, just cause it offers much more than Panera Bread and Corner Bakery. They also have what looks like an salad bar too."}
{"text":"My credit card information was stolen after I purchased lunch from this location. I called the manager the next day to simply alert her that there may be an issue with their machine. She absolutely denied any possibility of the fraud charges coming as a result of her store, she even went as far as to tell me that \"None of my employees even know anyone in California\" (CA is where the fraudulent spending came from). Her reaction to my call was that of a remarkably poor manager, particularly considering that I didn't call to complain, just inform.

Be warned-- fraudulent charges appeared on my card after paying for a meal at this Jason's Deli. That, coupled with a ridiculous reaction from the manager are enough to keep me from returning."}
{"text":"I used to love Jason's Deli years ago, but for a number of reasons it's more of a tepid like as of late. 
I've been to this location a handful of times, each time hoping to be a bit impressed. I mean, it's not a cheap place, and the concept is cool...but still, I'm un-wow'd. 
There are not many vegetarian options, and no vegan ones. The salad bar was very small and not very exciting, also didn't look very clean, as everything was spilled into each other. 
I made up an order of pasta w marinara and that's all..I would've liked to add veggies but the add-on price was going to make my simple pasta closer to $20. For Jason's deli...too high. 
Got my order and the pasta noodles were mushed together, and the sauce had sooooo much sugar. It was like what I imagine pasta at Denny's tastes like. 
Also, the staff isn't very helpful nor fast. I think I've given this place enough chances, I don't think I'll be dining here again."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli is the jam when it comes to fresh sandwiches overflowing meat and toppings.  I'm always blown away by the selection of fresh meats, cheeses, and bread and the combinations that the cheerful staff point clueless folks to.  .

VEGETARIANS BEWARE: YOU WILL BE APPALLED BY WHAT I WILL SAY NEXT.  Like Todd W. says, the roast beef sandwich is awesome.  I've had it twice and I can honestly say its the best roast beef sammie I can recall.  It's not like that grey matter they serve at Arby's.  No, its pink at the core, moist and pilled 1-inch thick on bread.  The sides are equally appealing, like the homemade-tasting potato salad.The portions alone make this place stand out-think McAllister's on steroids

The salad bar looked incredibly fresh as well.  In fact, the whole establishment looks fresh.  Yes, you get free muffins and ice cream.  But don't let them spoil your appetite-their sandwiches alone will bust your gut.  For around $8, you will leave Jason's Deli fat and happy."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches!!! Club Royale my favorite!!! And fettuccine Alfredo yummm! I wish they had one in LA!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the salad bar and free ice cream! Great place for a large group and a quick bite"}
{"text":"I'm being generous with this rating cause I wanted to give 2 stars but the people working were very friendly. The only positives were the free  ice cream cone and the salad portion of bar. They had good choice of toppings and dressings however the rest of the bar was not worth $8! The potato salads were like the to go stuff you find in a grocery store cheap and gross. 
I ordered the caprise sandwich and it was cold...That type of sandwich should be heated so the cheese melts and bread is warm...Spent $7 on that and disappointed...
My son's mac and cheese was the usual Kraft from the box for $4 kind of a rip off

Too bad they can't get it together with the food choice and prep cause their service is decent"}
{"text":"This is an excellent spot for a meal. The food is good, we'll prepared, and reasonably priced. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful. This is truly a first class stop and we'll worth it."}
{"text":"A few of us went in for lunch today.  The place was packed, but the food and service were both fantastic!!  I had the salad bar and my guests had sandwiches.  Everything tasted fresh. We got our sandwiches within five minutes.

The manager stopped by our table twice to check on us.  Another employee came by to see if we needed anything. The service was impressive to say the least."}
{"text":"I can only give Jason's deli one star because everything I experienced while I was there was horrible.  Long likes, poor quality ingredients, food that is overly seasoned, ie:  soup that is so salty you just can't eat it.  When I asked for a refund after filling out a survey, I am still waiting for over a month for my refund in the form of a check.  So, in short, don't waste your time or money going to Jason's deli.  Go to places like Panera bread, or a local family establishment.  You are sure to better food, better service and more value for your money!"}
{"text":"His is such a great place for a vegan. It's hard to find a great salad bar, but Jason's is always a winner. The salad bar is always fresh and replenished quickly. Not a complaint about anything. I always look for Jason's when I travel.  Very reliable and healthy choices."}
{"text":"We have ate here a few times before. They always forget something. But this time it was ridiculous.  They forgot our chips and salsa which on the menu it clearly states it comes with it. We called to let them know because they are always forgetting something. The girl who answered was rude and blamed us for forgetting.  The wrap was OK but wayyyy to small and not worth the money. I could make way better quality food at home. I don't suggest this place. But I'm giving it 2 stars because the free ice cream is delish."}
{"text":"Seasonal Beef Stew is very good, hardy and not too salty. The muffuletta special is so much food. Everyone is very nice. Not the fanciest of places but a to go order is very quick and the bathrooms are clean. defiantly a good pit stop on the way home, to use the restroom and grab dinner to go. Prices are reasonable and I have not tried the potatoes yet but I hear they are good too."}
{"text":"Is it lunch time yet? This is a great place to eat, especially if you're planning to dine-in. You can either stand in the ever growing lunch line and order a sandwich or another item on their menu. OR, you can skip the line and order at their computer at the end of the line to access their salad bar. I've done both, I will likely revisit the salad bar. You can even fill a plate, finish the salad and go back up to get a fresh plate to make another salad with.

Whether you order from the salad bar or not, you can still enjoy endless ice cream! Boom, that's right. Endless. Ice. Cream. The perfect end to any lunch, especially if you have a sweet tooth.

There seem to be plenty of booths and tables for seating with a group or on your own. The staff is also very attentive and float around the room to clean up messes and make sure the salad bar is fully stocked. Definitely a lunch spot you'll feel welcome at and want to return to often!"}
{"text":"I returned to Jason's Deli 9 year's after retirement from Longs Drugs Store at Boca Park. I had frequented the Deli 3 times a week in the past and was actually disappointed by the portion of the sandwich."}
{"text":"The bread was old and dried out and they got my order wrong. I ordered in picked up so by the time I got home and tried to eat it.... it completely fell apart into pieces.  I wasn't going to drive back. 

I called the store and the manager first blamed the French bread as an issue on the fact that it was toasted. I told them it was not toasted - 

then the manager said that it would be better if it had been toasted. 

No excuse provided for the missing ingredients. 

The sandwich was inedible and I asked for my money back.  

I am the last person to complain - but in this case..... it warrants a complaint. 

The worst part is that, again, I am the last person to complain... but when I did call them to tell them about the situation... the response was contradictory excuses and was told that it could be over a week until I see a refund. 

Topping it all off... they hope to see me come back as a patron in the future? Really?"}
{"text":"Quick lunch spot with a plethora of options (in varying degrees of healthiness).  We were there with a group of 7 and everyone gave their varying sandwiches thumbs-up, which is a good enough endorsement for me!

I had the french dip and the chicken panini (split with a friend), and both really hit the spot."}
{"text":"had catered jason's for 2 days for a seminar and my fear for sandwiches are coming back... 

dislikes:
1)  sandwiches were substandard.  the chicken sandwich made the bread super soggy by the time it got delivered.  the rye bread for my ham sandwich was dry as eff.
2)  drinks.  we got 3 waters and random 3 soda for the group of us to pick, awkward.  you either get first dibs or you're stuck with whatever is left.
3)  no standardization.  first day we just got canned soda and bottled waters, second day drink cups and ice miraculously appeared with the drinks.  
4)  chips.  one ginormous bag of ruffles to share.  better get first dibs here too or set a \"pour out of the bag instead of reaching in with your hand\" rule or else you're about to get some tainted chips.

all in all, thank you, jason, for reminding me how much i hate sandwiches."}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday 12/10 for lunch, and after visiting Jason's Deli for at least the 10th time now, I can firmly and confidently say I am a complete FAN of everything about Jason's Deli!  

Here's what I like about this place...

*Plenty of free parking - This particular Jason's deli is in a open plaza with parking abound.

*Great Service - I have never experienced anything but superb service while patronizing this establishment.  Someone usually politely greets you when you walk in and is ready and willing to take your order or answer any questions you might have.  

*Salad Bar - I don't know of many places with a GREAT salad bar here in the Charlotte area, but the salad bar at Jason's Deli has to be one of the best around!  It put's Harris Teeter's salad bar (which I love btw) to shame.  This salad bar has options like Donald Trump has wives - and that would be a lot!  They have house made dressings, garlic toast, muffins, corn bread, fresh fruit, fresh cut veggies, etc.  If you like salads, Jason's Deli is your heaven.

*Build Your Own Sandwich - I love building my own sandwich when I go to Jason's deli.  Its an option on the menu which allow you to design your own sandwich for around $6-$7.  I am especially found of the chicken salad.  I know, I know, CHICKEN SALAD?  But YES, CHICKEN SALAD!!  It is the BEST, the BEST in ALL of Charlotte!!  The secret to their chicken salad is the pineapple chunks that are mixed into the chicken salad.  Still don't believe??  Just go try it and you will be a believer. 

*The Pastas - The chicken pasta primo and the chicken alfredo are tasty and extremely filling.  Due to the amount of pasta they give you, I usually stay away from the pastas when I am looking for a light meal especially during lunch time.  Never-the-less, the pastas are better than you think and make for an excellent meal on any day of the week.

This place has awesome food with a freshness you can taste!"}
{"text":"Normally, I really like Jason's Deli, but this one needs a little help. I went there for lunch for a standard salad bar and soup combo. The salad bar needed the work. The spinach was wilted and watery, the dressings needed to be replenished and it was very hard to reach everything since the salad bar was so wide (and no they didn't put 2 of each thing on each side) you had to go down both sides of the bar if you wanted to get the veggies. And the veggies weren't even fresh..."}
{"text":"Good food but a little bit pricey for soup salad and a drink (13) but the food was fresh and good. The free ice cream is a bonus too."}
{"text":"We ordered two sandwiches and found the bread to be almost inedibly dry. The toasted telera sandwich was very stale and tough, more like an old take and bake ciabatta. The French bread was also dry. Toppings were good as were the chips that came with the sandwich."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my sandwich from here, and then a staff member came around to remind me about the complimentary ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places!  Quality and fresh, great choices for any deli lover. Soup and salad. I always come back to Jason's! It's so hard for me to decide which yummy sandwich to choose, but the hubby usually goes for the beefeater with au jus. Prices are a bit high but in my opinion so worth it."}
{"text":"I had my first experience here via a $5 off coupon they sent me for my birthday.   I'm a sucker for coupons so I jumped on the opportunity.   I don't quite remember the name of the sandwich but it's was roast beef with gravy for dipping.   I did enjoy it a lot.  The roast beef was tender, bread was good, sauce had nice flavor but a tad bit salty for these taste buds.   Sandwich is a respectable size.   I left feeling satisfied and wasn't compelled to come home and eat Doritos or whatever crap I occasionally eat.  

For my old school people, it reminded me of the roasted beef sandwich from Roy Rodgers.   

Place was super big.  Plenty of seating and tables were all clean.  

Nothing bad to say about the place.  Thus the maximum amount of stars."}
{"text":"I had signed up for their email club and had a $5 credit for my birthday so I figured why not.   I grabbed the beefeater, which was roast beef, some kind of cheese and the au jus sauce (yeah, I'm spelling that wrong but you know what I mean).   Super tasty sandwich and very solid amount of meat.   Not sure I would pay the normal cost of $8.99 but the taste was in point.  It reminded me of the Roy Rogers roast beef sandwiches for all my old school people.  If you're gonna eat there and you like roast beef, do it up with the beefeater."}
{"text":"Are here yesterday and ordered the Baked Potato and maneuver special \"Salwhich\" lol salmon sandwich.... it was delicious ... homie got the half sized sweet potato and he wasn't upset about it !! Wish I had taken pictures but they're potatoes are the Bomb !!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Great soups and sandwiches.  Salads are pretty darn excellent also.  Fast service, clean and friendly staff all add to the fact that we will be back."}
{"text":"Great experience at JJ's. Adam and Stephen were kind and attentive and my sandwich was perfect! Thanks for hiring quality people who care about their job and their customers!"}
{"text":"My colleagues and I go out for lunch once a week and when someone mentioned \"uh, Paymon's again?\", someone else suggested Jason's Deli.  This was my first visit and I was pleasantly surprised.  We arrived around 11:30am, so it wasn't too busy, and immediately placed our orders.  I ended up getting the club lite sandwich sans cheese and pretty much inhaled it.  Yum!  The sandwich comes with your choice of side (I chose the fresh fruit).  Next time I come, I'll probably do the salad bar thing....I noticed a few people with dessert-like options (ice cream, graham crackers, etc).  

Service was friendly and the place looked clean.  Everyone there appeared happy to be there, including the staff!  The joint is a casual, cafeteria-like place, so don't go expecting prime rib and wine.  (However, your order is brought to you, which slightly elevates the vibe.)

Try the oatmeal-cranberry-walnut cookie.  It's homemade and it's SO GOOD.  Totally worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Stepped in Friday early evening to try the Muffelatta. . OK I guess I had high expectations, cause the only other ones I've ever eaten have come directly from the grand daddy of Muffelatta's straight from New Orlean's, Central Market from the French Quarter. This Verison of the sandwich that Jason's Deli made was a very West Coast approach to the sandwich. I mean it had the olive dressing, and the meat reminded me a little of what the real ones are like, but not really in the same ballgame.. It was a little dry for my liking, and I wish the bun on it was a little more toasted. But if you've got a really tight budget and want a sandwich to feed you for like 3-4 days order it, you can always alter the leftovers at home to your liking. 
The Muffelatta was freakin huge. Like 4 sandwiches in one. Yes you can order the half for 3 dollars less but I like nibbling on my food a day or two later. The sandwich was only $10, and came with a pickle and some ruffles potato chips, and a side, potato salad. I probably won't order the huge sandwich again, just cause it was a little disappointing because I'm used to sorta standard on them, but wouldn't say it tasted bad at all.
For the price and the amount of food you get it's a pretty good deal.."}
{"text":"They have free soft serve ice cream with your meal!  That alone gives this place 3 stars. 

I've only been here a couple of times and it's growing on me. My boyfriend is a huge sandwich person and I am not but I decided to give in since he was buying lunch. The first time I came here I decided to be anti-sandwich and got the chicken alfredo. It was a huge serving and it was ok, but not great. 

The next time I came here was for a team lunch (yay, my company was paying), and this time I got half a Bird to the Wise sandwich (it's a warm sandwich, which I prefer) and a cup of broccoli and cheddar soup. I loved both. However, I had to tell the boyfriend that I just liked both, \"You know, it was ok, whatever,\" because he would find it necessary to drag me here all the time."}
{"text":"We used Jason's Deli catering for a family event (30 people) and it was fantastic. Couldn't be easier. Place your order online (the options and prices are clearly described) along with your location and delivery date/time, and you're done. They called to confirm the day before, and the delivery was made on time and with everything we needed. Such a relief when you're planning an event!"}
{"text":"Hopefully this will reach the Manager Monica Geer - YOU are ruining what once was a great restaurant. I used to love going here but the last few times the salad bar is poorly attended to. Salad everywhere! Empty selections. Over baked muffins and attitude from your LAZY employees when you ask them to refresh the salad bar. Don't tell me you can't keep up with it because there was a manager named Michael that worked here before who ran a tight ship and nothing was ever empty or unsanitary. Get another job Monica because you suck as a manager!"}
{"text":"Its a glorified sandwich shop. There wasn't anything that was too spectacular. I had the Royal Club and it was a good sandwich, but it wasn't great..."}
{"text":"This place is good. It's the only local salad bar.  It gets busy during lunch but worth the wait. When my wife is craving a salad this is where we go. 

It does get confusing when you've never been there and you are trying to figure out how to access the salad bar. My wife had to ask for a plate after paying and circling the salad bar without any success. 

This is the place to go for a salad bar hands down."}
{"text":"I think I'm starting to become a bigger fan of Jason's. I work nearby and have started coming here more than I used to, mainly becuase I'm seeing more value to eating here besides the convinience. 

They have a great selection of sandwiches, soups and baked potatoes and sometimes I find myself not knowing what to get. I usually go for lunch but stopped by in the morning today (since Cafelatte was closed) and tried a breakfast panini that was absolutely delicous! The bread was grilled to crispy perfection and the egg and bacon were good and not overly greasy. 

During lunch you can eat at the salad bar, which I never have, or order off the menu. All their sandwiches are pretty good and I don't necessarily like one better than the other since all the ones I've had so far were delicious. They also have huge baked potatoes and bowls of soup that are good for the times I don't feel like having a sandwich. Service is wonderful here and even though it can get pretty busy here during lunch, the line seems to move along efficiently. If you dine in, you can even enjoy free soft serve ice cream, which I tend to forget about! Also, if you plan to come here often you can buy a travel mug for $3.99 and get 99 cent soft drink refills anytime you stop in with your mug."}
{"text":"I came here after a long day of work craving these amazing baked potatoes, I walk up to the doors and every door is locked. They close at 9:00 and they have the doors locks at 8:30. We call to speak to a manager cause there are six people standing out side trying to get in and they say they have them locked due to lack of business. Lol great so let's lock out all the business that you could of had."}
{"text":"It's 845 and this Jason's deli has shut down their salad bar, we just ordered at 830, and they basically have said you can't have anymore, we are taking our shit away!!!  I've never seen such a thing honestly and as good as the sand which and soup was, this is a damn joke.  845!!! No plates, no lettuce, no bread, half of the sides are gone!  Unreal!"}
{"text":"3 things that i love about this place. 
1. Unlimited croutons to compliment my soup.
2. Handful of iced tea choices, 
3. The comfy simplicity of the place.

But not limited to: the wide selection of hot gourmet soups that nourish my body. They pick the best selection of beef for pastrami. Free self serve ice cream in a cone. Staff is overall friendly. Food is so very filling, I always find myself bringing extra food home In a to-go box. But then again, maybe it's from the unlimited croutons I use to dip in my tomato soup. I definitely love coming here."}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and happy every time we came in. The food is always delicious. Decent prices and free soft serve always a good thing!"}
{"text":"We always come here for the California Club which is the best croissant
 sandwich in town for a reasonable price! It comes with fruit with yogurt dip or chips. I would go for the fruit. You dip that sandwich with the yogurt dip! So yummy.
Also I love their salad bar... plenty of fruit and veggies to choose from. It's very clean and filling for under $10."}
{"text":"On different days I love different things at JD.  Most of the time I love the chicken pot pie soup, the chili, and the salad bar, the meatball pasta dish with garlic bread, but the mediterranean wrap has me on a daily crave.  It's a wheat wrap with turkey, roasted red pepper hummus, cucumbers, olives, greens, tomatoes, and I add mushrooms and sprouts...and only a sweet 320 calories....pricey yes but well worth it........and who can resist free ice cream?"}
{"text":"Food was ok. I would eat their again. Prices were reasonable. However the delivery charge was really high especially since they are only half mile away. They did quote me 30-45 mins but showed up in less than 20 so that is a plus."}
{"text":"First off, I found the layout confusing when I went to pay. Despite having 2 registers at the to-go counter, I was directed to the salad bar with a diminuitive smile and told 'There aren't actually any registers here'. She probably meant that they weren't on, sooo whatever. Not a huge deal but worth mentioning.

I got the muffaletta sandwich with salami for the boy. It was on thick, flavorful bread with cheese, olives, hearty portions of salami and what tasted like pepperoncini. It came with a bag of chips and a cup of soup [I opted for the tortilla] for about $8-9 after tax. The soup was really tasty, made with beef and full of rich umami flavor and vegetables. I saw tomatoes, carrots, corn and lots of herbs. 

The sandwich was a generous portion and I like that it came with two sides. I find this comparable to Quizno's 2 items for $6. I'd say this restaurant is much higher quality, though. For a dollar or two more you can get an organic salad topped with a delicious array of toppings. I would like to go in sometime for their salad bar, it looked quite promising from what I could see. My veggie-lovin' self could have an orgy of produce on my plate and be stoked! It looks like a lot of it is organic, too, which is a great thing to see in the middle of the desert.  

I like that they serve Sweet Leaf teas in the bottle, I haven't seen them anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Came here a lot when I worked nearby. The managers were always awesome & friendly. They even bought my lunch a couple times since I came in so often. Can't promise they'll do the same for you, but they'll certainly treat you right."}
{"text":"Close to REI (!!), good prices, great food quality, huge portions, yummy cranberry walnut cookie.  :)  It's upscale cafeteria dining with table service!  I like the low-cal options as well as the salad bar (unlimited house brand graham crackers?!!! they're so good!).  Unpretentious and great for hanging out.  I came here the other night with two musician friends to talk shop and we stayed for a couple of hours without guilt.

Did I mention how good that cran-walnut cookie is?"}
{"text":"Top service and food is great.   A wide selection of soups which is great in the winter months.   Personal favorite is the Rueben sandwich."}
{"text":"Wir waren heute bei Jason's deli vorbeigelaufen und dachten uns was isst der Mann für einen riesigen Salatteller. 
Dann sind wir einfach mal rein und haben uns informiert. Hier gibt es alles frisch und super  lecker zu bereitet. Wir haben uns für die Salatbar entschieden. Für 8 Dollar bekommt man einen großen Salatteller (würde sagen es ist ein großer Nudelteller) und den kann man randvoll machen mit lauter frischen Sachen. Man kann so viel essen wie man höchste. Es gibt auch noch gratis Eis wenn man möchte."}
{"text":"I never actually eat at their location... I get it delivered. Their food is good and their drivers are always super nice... but damn! They NEVER get my order right. How hard is extra red onion and NO NO mustard? It always comes the other way around: EXTRA mustard (HATE IT) and NO onions!! WTF. I called to complain and they didn't even bother to rectify it. BOO Jason's deli. You should make it right. It's sad because I do like their food... you cannot beat their potato salad."}
{"text":"Great sandwich and salad bar.. we always order the California Club. The croissant is so flaky and it comes with fresh fruits and yogurt dip! Yummy"}
{"text":"I am not reviewing the food, albeit I think for what you get it's overpriced.The ordering system is confusing when you first walk in the door if you have never been there. I saw some cards hanging on a rack and seeing a European sandwich?? listed for what I thought was $1.75, I thought I would be getting more of a tea sandwich size instead of a full blown roast beef because I was getting a soup as well. Imagine my surprise when I was billed almost $13.00 for soup and sandwich. While I was ordering, a girl was attempting to throw hands full of potato chip bags onto a ledge which kept falling on the floor near the register. Guess they didn't train her on what a step stool is. What was really offensive was the man who brought my tray of food stood directly at my table holding my food yelling across the restaurant to a coworker telling her he loved her and bye (not just once, but several times while I'm waiting for him to put my food on the table). The kicker is that two men who appeared to be regional or district managers for the corporation were sitting one table behind me and said nothing. The food wasn't outstanding, the staff is totally unprofessional and I didn't even get a pickle with my sandwich."}
{"text":"So, yes your topical salad bar that has not changed much in oooosay 20 years.  If anything they could punch it up a little and take a page from the flower child.  

All in all, the food is still the same as it was 20 years ago when they opened and good I might add.  But could be better considering all the rabbit restaurants opening up and taking huge margins from a dinosaur that should be the king of lettuce buffet.

Get your brightest and best and come up with something unusual or different that makes you stand out.  Add other foods for example.  If you stay in the mud motionless, people and ideas will wall right buy you.

3 stars food was what I expected blah but ok.  Service was in the middle of lunch and dinner shift so plates were everywhere with the staff on their usual breaks.  Go here only because you will know exactly what to expect every time."}
{"text":"Tyree was the first person to greet us and he was VERY good at his job! It was my first time at Jasons Deli and he explained in detail what everything was like. I had t he chicken pot pie soup. By far thee best I've ever had, however it could have had more chicken it. It came with a pastry puff on top that was made to perfection. It was a little piece of heaven. My bf had a duffernt sandwhich th e carolina special it was very good and i had thr santa fe chicken sandwhich. Great guacomole and i got it on foccia bread. To die for! THE BREAD was amazing and thr bacon the 1000 island. Highly recommended. The salad bar had hummus even! Good hummus too! It had so many things you usually want but don't get to see at a normal salad bar. It has complimentary muffins snd a variety of organic crackers, pumpkin cheese jalapeño wafers, etc. The environment was fun and calm and nice for a little day date. This location however, EVERY employee I spoke to was more than willing to help me and go out of their way to make sure I was haply. I'm easy yo please but they were so sweet. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but the customer service I received was OUTSTANDING!!! I will post a pic of her & I don't even usually leave ratings but she was exceptional and deserves recognition & praise! Thank you very much you are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Always great food at a reasonable price, best salad bar I have seen in a long time"}
{"text":"I've been to many jdeli and this one was great. The service was great. The seafood gumbo is to die for and yes...it's spicy. The club Royale is a great sandwich with a different type of sauce but it's a good sandwich.  They give you a lot of meat too."}
{"text":"I always wanted too check this place out. My brother comes here all the time with his family and tells me great sandwiches overall good solid food. After night of trick-treat with family headed too Jason's Deli with my nieces.

First impression was big, spacious, and really nice for deli sandwich/shop. I love the high ceilings, decor really nice, tons of places too sit down (went late so had no idea looks like packed), and couple television inside. I like you get number style pick table,  and they find number bring food too you. The soda fountains unlimited, looking at it soda fountain lot of stuff going on, and the salad. Looks like winner. I never order salad but sure the next visit have too try it. I love all the topping looked fresh, lot too choose from, and it clean (you know times go too say sweet tomatoes; some people are slobs miss the plate). 

I ordered something from there famous sandwich section of the menu. I settled on the reuben sandwich. Awesome! The amount of corn beef its 1/2lb states on the  menu feels like lot more because barely able too finish all of it! I did! =) It cooked perfection nice, hot, and moist. The special dressing, sauerkraut, pickles, and bread together was divine. The corn beef was nice steamed hot, moist, and bread great fresh taste. It came with chips too. 

The service was great the lady at the counter was really nice. The manager there walking around checking up on us several times. Nice staff. One of the kids dropped his soda. We told one workers sorry and he really nice said smile no problem went ahead cleaned it up. 

There lot more stuff on the menu from pastas, soups (nieces had tortilla soup; they love it), and lot more for me try on next visit!"}
{"text":"I really like Jason's Deli, used to go when we lived in Colorado, not close to home but went yesterday! And to my surprise they are gone, empty building and no sign to say they moved somewhere else! I will miss this place, loved their salad bar, not many places do that anymore! They were always busy, wonder why they closed!!!!"}
{"text":"I looooove Jason's Deli.  I would have to say it's one of the best Deli's I have ever been to.... Ever!  I order from there all the time and never get sick of it. They have a huge menu, which typically will make me leery of a place, because really, who can perfect that many items?.... Jason's!  All their food is made fresh to order, and they will modify anything on the menu to meet your needs.  Their online ordering system is easy to use and allows you to save your favorite orders.   They also have a great salad bar and their soups are fantastic.  My favorite is their vegetarian French onion soup, served in a bowl with boiling hot provolone cheese,  yum!  You will leave stuffed to the max or with leftovers, but don't forget to grab a complimentary ice cream cone on your way out."}
{"text":"California Club was perfect!

The management was very prompt. Lines moved quick

Great lunch place!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Any time I want soup or a sandwich this is my place. For some reason this time when we came there was an employee in the back shouting in Spanish to the other employees. Her voice seriously sounds like a Halloween black cat. It's so awful."}
{"text":"Pretty much anything here is outstanding.  I ahve not ever had a sandwich here that was \"average, or plain\".  They have great ingredient combonations of everything.  In the morning their breakfast taco totally hit the spot.  I recently had one of their baked potato's..holy crap it was huge and I mean huge!!  Loaded up with all the good stuff if you want.  I ate it and wasn't hungry the rest of the day.   Everyone at this Jasons is freindly, the cashier guy is great with each and every person he helps."}
{"text":"This Jason's Deli is certainly my favorite one! Everyone is so so kind and generous here! 

As with all Jason's Delis, the food is delicious! 

I highly recommend the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich! It's a great taste combo. Definitely on the savory end of sandwiches! It's a great combo of flavors! 

I also highly recommend the Hot Pastrami Sandwich. I find pastrami sandwiches to be salty often times but it's honestly perfect here. I'm weird and I enjoy the sandwich with croissant and provolone cheese though many people seem to opt for rye/ white/ wheat with Swiss! I prefer provolone for that subtle cheese taste though you may enjoy the sharp tang of the melted Swiss cheese! 

I also enjoy the Royale Club. I do dock points cause it's not toasted and I'm a toasty sandwich type of person. Though the croissant is fantastic so not a huge loss! I do find this sandwich to have a bit too much meat for my taste. It overwhelms all the other flavors, including the honey mustard!! But the meat is still delicious so again, not a huge deal. 

Make sure to get some pickles to complement your sandwiches. I also recommend the Kettle Cooked chips over the baked ones! The kettle cooked chips come with sea salt and they're yummy! 

Lastly, don't skip out on the fruit dip!!! It's so so so good!!!! But then again, you may want to opt for the FREE ICE CREAM for dessert instead! There's always a lot of delicious options at Jason's Deli so you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but the customer service I received was OUTSTANDING!!! I will post a pic of her & I don't even usually leave ratings but she was exceptional and deserves recognition & praise! Thank you very much you are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Henry Morales is an awesone employee. Every time I come here and he's here he's always in good spirits and makes my meal enjoyable. The salad bar is always clean and stocked well. Other employees make sure tables are clean and make sure they're attended to as soon as customers leave or before they sit down. Plus free softserve after a meal is always great."}
{"text":"I used to not like this place, but I read they changed everything. The Now use these amazing organic cibatta rolls and have removed the High Fructose corn syrup from everything!!! The also are the first restaurant to take it upon themselves to remove trans fat form 100% of everything sold there!. The Royal with light mustard is super good and I usually just switch any of the sandwiches for turkey and ham if I only like the toppings. 

It has totally improved and I come here often now. Oh and I read a review that said you get Soft serve with any meal? Is that true? Why did I not know that?

I would give them an extra star but they have a lesbian that works there that is thinner than me, jk ....but there is"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch at Jason's Deli this week. A group of us from work headed over to this Gilbert location right at noon and it was completely packed. An employee was nice enough to get 3 tables and 8 chairs despite the crowd and we really appreciated that. My California Club was PLENTY of food for a lunchtime meal and the croissant was perfectly baked. And unlike other places, the fruit side that comes with sandwiches and had nice big juicy strawberries included. So many places just give you cantaloupe and that made the strawberries seem extra special. Plus the yogurt dip that comes with the fruit side was yummy too!  :)

Added neat factors: 

-My job has our lunches from Jason's Deli catered all the time and from what I've heard, the deliveries always go smoothly.

-After our meal several of my coworkers popped over next door to Sub-Zero and said the ice cream rocks!"}

{"text":"Walked around for a while and found Jason's deli.  Place was clean and I tried their reuben sandwich today.  I give the Reuben 4 stars for taste."}
{"text":"We have frequented Jason's Deli mainly due to convenience and Salad Bar but this shall no longer be the case.  Yesterday, one of two salad plates was returned for replacement due to being dirty with baked on crumbs. No acknowledgment of the dirty plate, just a new plate shoved into my hand.  When the sandwich arrived, the spare plate used to share the sandwich was also dirty.  Same routine from the staff at the counter, no acknowledgement of the dirty plate, just another plate issued.   During this visit, fifty percent of the plates were dirty, with no indication or acknowledgement from the staff of this being an abnormal occurrence.  What is wrong with this picture...?"}
{"text":"From NC to NV Jason's Deli is consistently good. Sandwiches were just as promised, but sloppy to eat. Loaded up at my one trip to the salad bar. Ice cream machine was being cleaned, so this was not even a four star experience."}
{"text":"I come to Jason's deli at least once a week (twice if I'm able) ... The salad bar is always stocked and fresh, the soup is always hot and very tasty. I recommend broccoli cheddar soup! I really enjoy the atmosphere, the people who dine here are very pleasant, kind people and I really like that. I will say lately tho, the staff has been a little slacking. The last time we went, the man preparing what was supposed to be my tray, took it away and just handed me my salad bowl. (THAT NEVER HAPPENS!!) also, the last few times, I've felt overcharged because I get the same thing every week and my price has increased. Instead of holding up the line to ask why, I decided to bite the bullet. The man delivering our food wasn't paying attention and couldn't find our order number on our table so I had to try to flag him down but I lost him and my food was cold by the time it reached the table (he walked past us 3 times) ... That said, I love the food & atmosphere and I will keep returning in hopes that the staff will exceed my expectations as they usually did in the past."}
{"text":"This review is getting 5 stars for their exceptional customer service! I haven't been here in years, however my BF wanted some soup since he wasn't feeling well and it was the closet place to us.

We entered the restaurant and planned to order to take out. We were greeted by Gerardo ( I believe he was the manager. He had a different uniform than the others) He handed us a menu to look at and told us if we had any questions let him know.

I ordered the deli club (Yummy! De-licous) and chicken noodles. My BF ordered the deli cowboy (he thought it was okay) and chicken noodle as well. Ah, yes....can't forget the complimentary ice cream that comes with every order

As we waited for our order there was a lady ahead of us and she must have been waiting a while because Gerardo was so awesome and was so apologetic to the lady because of the wait and offered her an extra cookie or chip for the inconvenience I know, it's not a whole lot to some BUT just the gesture and service was just really nice to see. 

Everyone was friendly. The place was clean and quiet. This was around 6pm and there was not a whole lot of people in the restaurant. 

While we waited for our food. Gerardo offered us water while we waited and apologized for the
A/C not working (which btw felt fine inside the restaurant) and not long after our food came out. 

Overall, I thought my Deli Club was de-lish! The Deli cowboy was okay but there are so many other sandwiches to try. I'd definitely come back and give it another go just because the customer service we had was awesome! Thanks again for the great customer service!"}
{"text":"I love Jason's Deli, and I try to stop by anytime I can find one."}
{"text":"I have nothing negative to say about this place. It's one of my favorite places to eat. Their salad bar is my absolute favorite. There's tons of variety and it's always super fresh. I got their seafood gumbo soup and it was bomb. I've also never seen my kids eat Mac and cheese so fast. My husband absolutely loves their muffulettas. We look forward to coming here when we can."}
{"text":"Their salad bar is my absolute favorite. After I first time I tried them, then moved away...I had dreams about Jason's deli. When I recently ate at them again, the hype did not disappoint. I do recommend the French onion soup or the gumbo. They're my favorite...and of course their salad bar.  I have a love relationship with their salad bar."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid, and have never stopped loving Jason's Deli. Affordable, friendly, efficient, and - most importantly - tasty.

Takeout, delivery, and dine in are all great options, but there's some delicious perks to eating here (see below).

If you're coming here for the first time, I would recommend:
- try the massive baked potatoes first before ordering anything else, it's unlike any you've probably ever had in your life or ever will
- don't miss out on the free self-serve corn bread and muffins at the end of the salad bar while you're waiting to be served
- don't also miss out on the free self-serve soft serve ice cream near the soft drinks after you've finished up

I've also heard good things about the sandwiches and AYCE salad bar, but I could never give you up Spud Au Broc Baked Potato!"}
{"text":"I'd recommend Jason's Deli. It was our first visit here. Staff was friendly and helpful. We ordered the 1/2 sandwich with soup or salad option. 
We both had club sandwiches. It comes with your choice of baked or regular potato chips. My husband had his with a cup of beef stew and I chose the salad bar. Our sandwiches were served with nitrite and nitrate free turkey & fresh veggies on a soft and flaky crossaint. 

The salad bar was fresh.

Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  My company frequently takes the employees here for lunch and there is something for everyone.  Great soup, salad, and sandwiches.  Did I also mention free ice cream?  I don't know what is so special about this ice cream machine, but it is the best ice cream I've ever had. 

I only wish there were more locations in this area."}
{"text":"I had to buy a recharger for my phone at Best Buy, so I figured I cruise by Jason's Deli for lunch since it's in the area.

FOOD:  3 out of 5.  I got the Quarter Ham & Salami Muffaletta with Spicy Seafood Gumbo and Chips.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  Their dressing was a tad bit sour and I couldn't taste the salami.  The shrimp in the gumbo had a very strange texture that didn't resemble any shrimp I've ever had.  

SERVICE:  4 out of 5.  They brought out my food pretty quick and within 5 minutes I was done, they picked up the trash.  The people working the counter were cool as well.

AMBIENCE: 3.0 out of 5.  It wasn't elegant, but it was clean.  Pretty much a clean fast food joint.


If I'm in the mood for a sandwich and am in the area, I'll stop by Jason's Deli.  Other than that, there's better options such as Rosallie's on Rainbow & Patrick and also Baguette Café on Sunset between Buffalo and Durango."}
{"text":"I admit it...I had a bad attitude about Jason's Deli.  When I worked in Tucson, box lunches from Jason's were a common option at 'in house' lunch meetings where the company provided lunch, and those box lunches were no bueno.

So, a friend wanted to go have lunch at Jason's - I fought it off for a few weeks...finally gave in.  Got there and ordered the Reuben.  Wow.  Really good!  Piled high with corned beef, good tasting kraut.  Even the plain potato chips were good.  What?

Definitely a good place to grab a sandwich - give it a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, fresh and lotsa free stuff, pickles, muffins and ice cream. As I was leaving I had 2 Togo boxes and an employee rushed over to pack them into a bag so I could carry them better! Talk about going above and beyond! The food came within 5 mins and I was very happy!! Will totally return with my family!"}
{"text":"FOOD WAS MICROWAVED..... Service was good but food was bland with no flavor. No flavor to food."}
{"text":"First time at Jason's Deli. I ordered the Yankee, which was a corned beef and pastrami mix on rye with Swiss. I subbed an onion roll. I added a drink and it came to. $14.28. This better be good for that price. 

My lunch arrived in 2 mins. It was piled high with meat, plus a small sliver of cheese. 

The meat, although plentiful, was very tough, and dry, making for a difficult meal. The bread was fresh, toasted and had good onion flavor but it couldn't contain the meat since it was such a tough chew. 

The restaurant itself was nicely laid out, with inside and outside seating. The TV was embarrassingly so small that you'd have to sit within two tables to see the picture. 

Disappointing visit. 

Gave Jason another at bat. I ordered the managers special and got 1/2 sandwich plus s cup of soup. I added a drink for $11.79.

The soup was thick, creamy and cheesy. It had big chunks of broccoli too. Very good soup. 

The sandwich was much better this time. Plenty of meat, fresh produce, soft onion bun and two slices of cheese this time. It also came with a big handful of plain, ridged chips. 

Much better visit."}
{"text":"Ate lunch with a large group.  Was treated great by Darcy.  Very polite, and fun to talk to.  She's making guests feel at home."}
{"text":"I try to stay away from chains, but I went here with a friend and liked it.  I got the turkey panini and it was good.  Ordered the Meatball Po'Boy take-out for my brother and that was really good also.  The order line is kinda unorganized which made it a little confusing."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. Although we live near a Jason's deli, I have never eaten at one. I had the \"special\" pot roast and provolone on French bread. It was outstanding. Reduced by one star based upon the limited guidance provided by the waitress when asking what food was good. I was also not asked if I preferred baked vs regular chips (I would have preferred the former but received the latter)."}
{"text":"food is great! but if you have never visited before it can be kind of confusing understanding how the front counter service works, esp when noone really acknowledges you for a couple mins while your just kinda standing there tryig to figure out if you go to the counter or seat yourself or wait for someone to seat you.... any who, as mentioned the food is great and great atmosphere in restaurant! Beefeater mmmm!!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich spot with pretty good service. I usually order their Reuben the Great with pastrami to go. It's great with a beer!"}
{"text":"My husbands order wasn't accurate but we were still satisfied with our meals. I love the salad bar, it's very fresh and has a good selection. My husband likes the turkey croissant sandwich. We would like to ce one closer."}
{"text":"Great salad bar with lots of organic choices! Perfect for my plant based lifestyle:)"}
{"text":"We really like this place, the sandwiches are great and the service is always good and friendly. They screw up the order every now and again."}
{"text":"Please, never order for to go. They gave a nasty salad I couldn't see how was it. Guacamole was old, disgusting lettuce . It ruined my lunch"}
{"text":"I had placed a large order for a company event. We were doing a healthy theme so decided to order from here. Ordering online was easy. I liked that they had photos of the items I wanted to order along with prices and the # of servings. My order was correct and the delivery guy came on time. My transaction went smoothly so no complaints there. The chicken wraps, veggie wraps, salad, hummus, guacamole were OK. A little too bland but you can add hummus or guacamole to make it more flavorful.

I came here on two different occasions. I had the gumbo. Let's just say I'll just stick with ordering gumbo from Cajun/Creole joints from now on. On another visit, I ordered the Irish potato soup. It was alright, nothing memorable and not terrible.

However, I was horrified at my friend's grilled cheese sandwich. I could not believe anyone would serve a pathetic looking sandwich. Barely one slice (1/2, 1/3 of a slice of American cheese?) of overcooked, dry cheese that didn't cover the entire surface of wheat bread. 

In my mind, a grilled cheese sandwich is supposed to be comforting and have cheese covering the whole bread with generous amounts of butter. I should have taken a picture. It's one of the easiest things to make too. My friend's facial expression was one of huge disappointment. I don't think even kids would eat this kid favorite sandwich. Please fix the grilled cheese sandwich!"}
{"text":"Jason's is awesome. I love the spinach veggie wrap. I get it EVERY time, and it's always good. This is a perfect place for a business lunch, or just a lunch with your co-workers. It's popular for the UNLV fac/staff crowd. They have a business card bowl, so bring your cards."}
{"text":"I really love their salad bar and sandwiches.  I am sad that they closed the one by me.  Always consistently good.  It helps that they have the ice cream for desert, even if it's just a small bite, it's a great touch."}
{"text":"Don't get hit sandwiches to go, they get soggy but none less the salad bar is amazing!"}
{"text":"Free Ice Cream!! Love the fresh all you can eat salad bar! Outstanding! Great food, great service! 
Undeniably good food!"}
{"text":"We're always ordering food from here for our lunch meetings and i believe Jason's does an nice, A-OK job.

This review is for the catering side, since I've never set foot in the restaurant. We normally order two or three trays of food. They usually include two huge two pound bags of chips. Ruffles I believe. 

We also get a mixed twelve case of pop.  Their trays have a mixture of breads (rye, white and whole wheat) and meats (roast beef, turkey breast and ham).   Jason also throws in some napkins, condiments and kosher pickles. 

It's all good, with very little left over. So if you are planning an office meeting, I would consider Jason's Deli."}
{"text":"I love their ham & salami muffaletta-- the toasted sesame seeds on the bun and the tapenade are two of my favorite parts of it. I also love their buttery toast crisps and soft serve ice cream, both of which are complimentary with the meal."}
{"text":"As much as I'd like to root for the underdog in an ever-expanding world of franchise dominancy, today has been the last straw. I felt I had a connection with Jason's reuben sandwich, first few times piled high with corned beef and a good proportion to sauerkraut. I even looked the other way when I was charged an extra $2 for them to do half corned beef/half pastrami (I got the same amount of meat). I still had faith in them. Then came the last few visits when the service became senile-slow and the food quality atrocious. I'd give it one last chance today and it was indeed the final rusty nail in my shabby coffin. Apparently I ordered an $8 sauerkraut sandwich called The Reuben; with a sliver of corned beef and a mountain of sauerkraut, it was everything my liberal vegetarianism craved. 

People of the jury, allow me to present Exhibit A... (photograph above)"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday and ordered chicken alfredo and plain jane potato. Food took over 20 minutes, and when my food arrived. The server dropped my bread in the red tray and put it back on top of my luke warm pasta. The tray was covered with black residue.. I was disgusted. The utensils section were dirty. Food sucks and food is microwaved. Never coming back on this location."}
{"text":"Generally good all around. Havent had a bad meal yet and the staff is very friendly at this location."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. After putting in a large order with Karen, she didn't accept the form of payment because we didn't have a form of I.d. for the debit and walked away to answer the phone and when we were ready to pay with another card she gave attitude and when I asked if they had a tip jar she said \"no it's on the line if you didn't tip us there you can just hand it to me.\" I assume because I didn't put in a tip on the line she waited a full 5 minutes before putting in our order and spent those 5 minutes chatting with a friend. When giving us our food she changed her tone to a more happy one, but once I got home and opened up my $8 panini there was two halves and one of the halves was missing half the sandwich bread. First time experience, and I was not happy with the service at all. The food was good, but would not go back to this location again."}
{"text":"We've been here a few more times. The places is always super busy with staff rushing to try to keep up. Pointers to them for keeping their smiles throughout it. 

My husband loves the turkey croissant sandwich. I enjoy their salad bar, which has a good variety of options. If you need a little protein you can add meat. I like the Tina salad with egg (there's not too much mayo in it which is a plus). 

Good selection of iced teas, drinks etc. The only downfall is they're so busy that it's chaotic....tables pushed around haphazardly, loud, and you may need to bus your own table. Although I have to give them a thumbs up - they saw us busing a table to eat and brought us a cookie and an apology."}
{"text":"If you want peppers in the potato salad and stale bread, go for it. We spent $100 on lousy food that no real Deli would ever serve. Never again"}
{"text":"Yum!  I was impressed by this place, expecting a regular deli.  What I got was a large selection of sandwiches, soups, salads and baked potatoes.  The service is good and the restaurant itself is big and open with lots of natural light.  I will definitely go back and probably have just as difficult a time deciding what I want from their impressive menu.  The only sour thing I have to say is that my boyfriend is convinced that the shrimp in his gumbo was tainted and made him ill.  I cannot prove this... My sandwich was great!"}
{"text":"Jason's Deli serves up a nice varied menu, good quality food, generous portions in a clean and friendly environment. My favorite is the salad bar of course, but they also have a great selection of soup to go along with it and sandwiches when I want a little more.
We also use Jason's to cater work events and it is always a crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"Like all Jason's Deli Restaurants, the food is good.  I have a few issues with this particular spot though.  The restaurant area was very dirty and so was the salad bar.  There is nothing less appetizing than a dirty salad bar.  Makes me question how fresh the product is on the bar.  Also, the soft serve machine was disgusting.  So bad, I decided to pass on the soft serve all together. 

There are a lot of restaurant options in this part of town, I would probably find somewhere else."}
{"text":"Shout out to Jason's  Deli on Maryland Pkwy in Las Vegas for pumping out 80 sack lunches in 45 minutes. For the kids attending the USA Football Fundamentals camp with Kerwynn Williams in Las Vegas, Valley High School On June 18. Epic nutritional lunch with epic service in epic time."}
{"text":"This place seemed very big for a deli. I came in at 8am but they were very busy with huge orders. Seating area was still getting cleaned up. I had to go round and round to find a place to sit. Cleaning is going on while I am eating....find out they open at 10. Why they didn't tell me? Crap, not coming again."}
{"text":"We had Jason's Deli cater lunch at our school today.  It was very confusing trying to figure out what the wraps were in terms of meats, chicken salad, tuna salad, etc.  Everything was mixed up on every tray and nothing was labeled.  People have allergies to seafood, so it was a bit tedious trying to figure out what was what.  When I took a turkey wrap, I opened it up to make sure there wasn't onions in it, instead I found guacamole.  Very little turkey itself and tons of lettuce.  It was also on a wheat tortilla, which was not tasty at all.  Please in the future LABEL everything (including ingredients) carefully so people do not have to worry whether or not they can eat something.  Separate the different sandwiches by meat, veggie, etc."}
{"text":"When they get it right it taste great. However later in the day the meat gets gamey."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick self-serve lunch option? My co-workers and I usually make a stop here once a semester (yes, my schedule will forever run on academic time). 

I find that the salad bar is well stocked with fresh ingredients to make a very tasty salad. They even have some organic options. I love artichokes, green peas, and a good hard boiled egg on my leafy greens! After lunch, reward yourself with a self-serve soft ice cream cone...I can't help myself.  

The sandwiches and soups look pretty good, but depending on what you order it could leave you wanting (as my co-worker sat sad-eyed looking over at my abundant salad compared to his chicken salad wrap).

There is plenty of seating with booths or tables that you can easily push together to accommodate any size group. The employees work with a smile and stay busy cleaning, bussing, replenishing. 

For the type of food place this is and all-you-can eat salad bar for under $10...I'm a fan."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot. The entire staff is awesome; they even remember my name. Everything is always clean, fast and fresh. I've NEVER had a bad visit (and I've been there a bazillion times.)"}
{"text":"It wasn't very busy, but there were 12 tables with dirty dishes and nobody cleaning up. I walked around looking for a seat and counted, had to do a couple laps. Then I had to bus my own table just to find a seat. Hopefully they are just having a bad day, but it was not a pleasant experience today!


Update 20 minutes later - Still all the dirty dishes, but 6 employees including manager having a ball chatting behind the registers."}
{"text":"Jason's Delis are like little signs from god/s/ess/esses that he/she/it/they love(s) us.  (Trying to be all inclusive here.)  I mean, seriously, you can look at the world and see war, famine, prejudice and wonder where the divine is in all that, but then I charge you to go to Jason's Deli and get a baked potato the size of a football.  Therein lies the divine, people.

But really, to stop with the blasphemy, Jason's is just rad.  The lines can get long if you go at lunch time rush hour, but that's because this place is darned good, people.  Plus, the line always moves quickly.  Everything I've ever got here is delightful, but I'm pretty partial to their broccoli cheese soup (oh, sweet baby Jesus), the California Club (sprouty sprouty yum time), the Beefeater and, when I dine in, I'm always hittin' up their bangin' salad bar.

Plus, once my friend Jen and I went and had the best summer afternoon meal of our lives when we saw a man dressed as Elvis and a pirate AT THE SAME TIME.  The aforementioned delicious broccoli cheese soup almost came out of my nose.  If the food didn't keep me coming back, the possibility of seeing Pirate Elvis again sure would."}
{"text":"Took my mom to lunch yesterday and I felt like soup, we both got the managers special which is a cup of soup, half a sandwich & your choice of regular or baked chips. 

The spicy seafood gumbo was great. Loaded with a lot of shrimp. Mom & I both got that. I had the half chicken panini, which was perfect. Mom had the Ruben and loved it. The chips were baked for both. 

You can never go wrong with Jason's Deli."}
{"text":"Had a lunch meeting with a client this afternoon.  Stand in line, place your order, fix your own drink, have a seat and they bring your food out.  Had the ruben (not bad) came with potato chips.  The sandwich was on grilled rye with a little dressing, lots of crout and a good amount of beef (a little dry).  Let's say I won't be ordering it again, large operation mid price point with lots of noise... Pricy for a sandwich joint..."}
{"text":"food is always delicious ! Salad bar really good.  Great service and they are very helpful if you picky like me.   not to mention who doesn't like free ice cream cone."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend. I haven't been to this one before but it's pretty similar to the others I have been to. The food was decent, service was average, nothing went above and beyond my expectations. The prices overall are a little higher than what I feel the quality is but I wasn't disappointed in the turkey club I got. I was quite surprised at how fresh the fruit was compared to most places of this caliber. Probably would be my first pick but I wouldn't be against returning if suggested by someone else."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Jason's in years & I've never really been a fan.  My mom was in town & loves it there, so of course being the awesome daughter I am, we went.  

It was a little confusing when we first walked in.  We couldn't find exactly where we order, most places usually have a \"Order Here\" or \"Pick Up Here\" kinda signage.  Girl behind the counter saw we were confused & directed us to the right area.  Mom got salad bar, she loved it, I got a chicken panini with chicken pot pie soup which was so good, hubby got a salmon sandwich. We all really enjoyed our meals.  I plan on going back for a big cup of that soup! I can't stop thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Their portions are pretty big, I always end up with something left over.  And their soups are tasty.  It kind of reminds me of Panera Bread, but with bigger servings and more selection.  And they deliver.  $20 minimum for delivery, understandable.

Service is a very relaxed, unfortunately sometimes rude, but I don't have to spend much time with them so I can overlook it.

Other than that, this is a great place for soups and sandwiches.  Their pastas are delicious too."}
{"text":"Honestly, I am not a big fan of big bread type meals. I did find the pesto chicken panini a rather tastey item. I liked that it wasn't slathered in mayo and that the pesto is light and not too oily. The chicken is generally tender and the toasting doesn't turn the bread into a hockey puck. Overall, a nice place to nosh at once in a while."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places-I eat here all the time and leave happy, full and feeling  like I ate healthy! Love the Amy Turkey-O sandwich as well as the Organic Vegetarian Vegetable soup which is one of the best soups I have ever had-vegetarian or otherwise!"}
{"text":"Asked my wife to pick up a sandwich here as I was unable. Never have been to Jason's before, but it was convenient. 
The young woman who waited on my wife was extremely courteous, and my wife brought home a corn beef sandwich on rye with side of slaw and potato salad. 
The corn beef was a little dry and not the best. The sides were very generous for the price.  I liked the potato salad but not the slaw. 
It was an experiment for us. Prices very fair but food was just okay."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from Jason's Deli and I ordered the \"The New York Yankee\". I have to say I was very impressed with the size of this sandwich. The meat was nice and juicy and the bread was toasted just right."}
{"text":"Really like Jason's Deli and have eaten here before and like the food and customer service.  However today I ordered to go, a corned beef sandwich and a cup of chili.  Chili was good until I nearly swallowed a twisty tie.  Called and spoke to Ben who was deeply apologetic and offered to send me a gift card for my entire order.  I appreciate his efforts and I want people to know that these things can happen anywhere, and I liked that Ben fixed this. 

Just had to post this, I will still go back but I'm skipping the chili!"}
{"text":"My wife loves the salad bar and free ice cream! I am a big fan of the sandwiches and soups. Clean and staff is always very helpful and friendly. If you are looking for a quick but tasty dinning experience, I recommend giving Jason's I try."}
{"text":"Oh come on.  Jason's deli.  Are you kidding me.  Terrible place.  I'm always amazed at how popular this place gets. I guess advertising works."}
{"text":"We come here pretty frequently and the food is usually good. Today, the place was packed... with dirty dishes on all of the empty booths and tables."}
{"text":"Love Jason's Deli! Come here often for work lunches as you always get a good sandwich, soup and salad bar if you so choose. 

Recently I went here because I lost a crown, so I needed something soft....think SOUP! And Jason's has a REALLY good soup selection! So I got their chicken noodle and a chicken breast on croissant (soft) as I made my own sandwich. That's another thing I love about Jason's....you can make your OWN sandwich. How cool is that? Of course, they offer some really good Standard selection sandwiches. 

There's something for everyone here. A great place to \"pig out\" OR great place to watch your calories as they have numerous healthy options as well. And their salar bar rocks....just watch the Ranch Dressing....IF you slather your salad with that, might as well get their double Pastrami!

Oh, don't forget they give you \"free\" frozen custard if you get a salad bar (I think). Always great in the summer."}
{"text":"Woudnt go anywhere else for a salad bar.  The kiosk at the back is the best way to just buy a salad bar and bypass the line.  Every time i order a sandwich i end up with more food than i can eat.  Good portion size and quality for the money."}
{"text":"Excellent quality food, the sandwiches and soups are always hooked up just right. I'm always customizing my orders and they are always coming out exactly how I ask. I order delivery to my business and to my home. The manager Joe is on top of his game he must be double checking the orders because they never come incorrectly. I highly recommend the broccoli cheese soup and the Cuban press. The chocolate chip cookies are always soft and freshly baked. Thanks to all the staff for making the food consistently and delivering on time !"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today with some coworkers.  It was about noonish and the lunch rush we beginning but I have to admit the line moved fairly quickly.  I ordered the ruben and it arrived in well under 10 minutes as did the rest of my partys' orders.

I'm giving this place 4 stars as a solid lunch spot, but saying they are a \"deli\" is kind of pushing it a bit.  They do have some deliesq food, but I just can't call it a deli.  I mean they have wraps, fru fru salads, pictures of Europe on the walls, a salad bar, etc.

For 10 bucks I got a pretty decent sized sandwich, chips, drink and some ice cream so I can't really complain.  The ruben though was just ok by my standards and the other sandwiches looked just ok as well.  The bread was ok, the helping of meat was ok, the sauerkraut was ok.  Everything was ok.  I just compare everything to Chompies which is the closest you can get out here to a real deli and by far my favorite deli sandwich place around."}
{"text":"This is a Kick.
 All of my friends told me to stay away from the Corned Beef at Jasons.
 Not a real Jewish Deli. 
OK Granted but I had a Corned Beef on rye with mustard. Potato salad side and guess what?
So far the BEST corned beef sandwich in Phoenix.
 Yes I went to Chompys and Yes I have been to Generations.....
No Fat- Lean-Piled High!......
My friend had the salad bar and told the manager it was better than Sweet T's...."}
{"text":"Worst experience ordering online. After waiting over an hour, we called and they said the online system was down even though we got the confirmation. They said they were only allowed to waive our delivery fee which was 2 dollars if we want it still. After more than 20 min talking w the manager they decide to take off our chili. Bad experience overall"}
{"text":"I love the chicken pot pie soup! The soup and sandwiches are always good and the unlimited soft serve ice cream is a major bonus."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Great sandwich and salad joint.  They have a great take out service.  Great food and a wide variety of food options."}
{"text":"Manager at this location is horrible. She would not allow us to break a $20.00 bill after our entire meal was paid by credit card. Nothing but attitude from this woman at lunch time. Sorry Carol. I'll pay you back when I can break my bill."}
{"text":"What a great find! Just stumbled upon it and will definitely make the drive from N Las Vegas to come back. Fresh soups , salads and sandwiches. Very clean!"}
{"text":"Great fresh good, clean spacious restaurant, and the staff is awesome! Very friendly and welcoming. The runners name was Alan he was super nice and great at his job!!! Great location A+"}
{"text":"Finally, went and dine at Jason's Deli last night after the movies. Perfect location across the street from Park Road Shopping Center. Everything is pretty much closed at 9:25 PM except for the movie theater. 

Have been ordering and taking out from Jason's for business meeting as well as on the go.

Jason's deli is not like your typical deli. It's has a little bit of everything. Reminds me of a cafeteria growing up. They have a salad bar and with a good selection to choose from. They had miniature gingerbread muffin which was so good. Pop one and you are addicted to wanting more. Only, tried one.

The Lobster Chowder is out of this world. Got it in a cup which was savory and so rich/creamy. They should call it Lobster Bisque for sure. What kind of liquor did they put in? Sherry? You definitely need to try this out. 

My regular is Hot Pastrami on Rye with Mustard. It was good and comes with a side of chips. We also ordered 1/2 a sandwich with salad and came with a side of chips too. Great place to bring the family for food is nice size portion to share with others.

Do not forget to get your free ice cream. Make your own. Soft ice cream with flavors or vanilla, chocolate or swirl-combo of both.

Nice and quite last night, there were other patrons at the deli at 9:25 PM."}
{"text":"This is a review for take out. Have ordered take out lunch here to bring to a meeting. This is the second time and the food is delicious for a Deli. Staff is friendly and helpful.

Good portions for sandwiches not like others with one or two slices spread out. The pastrami is not salty which I so appreciate for my health. Had so many pastrami sandwiches way too salty. Had Tuna Sandwich which is delicious too. Comes with a bag of chips and a 1/4 pickle. My all time preference for a business luncheon meeting. 
The rye bread is fresh and sandwiches freshly made. Definitely, my go to place."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this place. I used to come here a few years ago before moving away. I looked forward to coming back and enjoying some good food. Since leaving I came in ordered, sat down went to the bathroom which was disgusting. I walked out, it turns out they have a resident homeless lady that goes from table to table asking for money. 1 time around, \"no mam I don't have any cash\" second time around, \"so you can't help\" the place looks sad."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  The sandwiches are awsome.  The french onion soup is the best I've had and it is vegetarian!!  Plus you get free frozen yogurt (that tastes like ice cream) with your meal!"}
{"text":"Everything here is fresh and delicious. I love the salad bar.
Their delivery service is quick, although expensive.
Love the free ice cream.
The gumbo is delicious and I'm from Nola so that says a lot. It has lots of shrimp.
Lots of fresh ingredients.
I'm not going to hold this against them, but we ordered delivery last night. I ordered an original size potato, only received a half size. I couldn't send it back because my son already ate it. Also, ordered a can of coke but didn't receive it. But the salad bar salad I ordered was packed and had everything I asked for on it. Still delicious."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I had just got done with the p.f. Changs rock n marathon and was so hungry! Came here with a couple of friends that live in Tempe and man my mouth was not disappointed we came here! First of all mind you I am on a diet so I am watching my calories and right away I discovered they had a lighter side part of the menu! Score! I had the club with homemade organic chips with a homemade salsa it was amazing! They also have a salad bar to choose from that looked pretty extensive. I grabbed a few baguettes of the garlic type while we waited and some small bran muffins which were tasty. We sat outside for our food which was awesome and it didn't take long for it to be delivered to the table.+++ It was really good and filling and a steal for only 450 calories the chips were nice and crisp and the salsa really fresh. When in the Phoenix area again or any where else there is a Jasons I will most definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"The dirtiest restaurant I've ever been in. Filth everywhere.  Seems as if the health inspectors never check here."}
{"text":"They deliver! It's so hard to find healthy food that delivers and the food is amazing! I got the turkey california club and it was sooooo good. Try this place if you haven't, it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"OK.  I wanted to like this place but they didn't give me enough reason to.  I had the sandwich of the day.  It was an italian \"style\" sandwich.  First of all, I'm a big fan of italian cured meats but I could barely taste it.  The only thing I could taste was the bottled italian dressing they glopped on top and the pepperoncinis in the sandwich.  I would put this place at the same level as the crappy chain places like Panera and Atlanta Bread Company.  The word \"yawn\" comes to mind."}
{"text":"I am really impressed by this place and I will be back! I had my first visit today and everything was fantastic. 

Customer Service: if I could give this a 10 star rating I would. We told the cashier it was me and my sisters first time at Jason's Deli and they treated us like royalty. They answered every question and the manager came up to us asking if we needed anything and after our meal he asked us how it was. 
They really know how to treat their customers well. 

Food quality: HUGE PORTIONS! When they brought me my Reuben I was shocked at how much meat there was on it! I only ate half of it and was satisfied. The quality was pretty good! I would recommend it to a friend. 

Overall experience was enjoyable! I will be back! Thank you to the managers and workers of Jason's Deli!"}
{"text":"Though I've been to this location before and have  always liked it, I was most impressed with tonight's experience.
First, it's Tuesday and they brought back Kids Eat Free night which was a nice surprise at the register. Then the staff was very nice. And not just one person but everyone I encountered there was smiling and friendly- something I value in the places I like to patron. 
They also had a balloon artist, Jeremy, who was really talented and wonderful with the kids.
Finally, they had a coloring contest and (spoiler-all the kids won) the prize bags had some treats and a pass for another kids eat free coupon.
Not to mention the food is always delicious and the ingredients fresh from the salad bar.
A pretty great way to spend a week night night. We'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I've had sandwiches from Jason's Deli for years through work catering, and always enjoyed them. Most recently I've had the Chicken Salad on a croissant and the muffalata, which I've had in New Orleans but didn't know they had added it to their menu. The muffalata is HUGE! A half portion could easily feed 2 people. The olive spread wasn't overpowering, which is good for me because I'm not a huge fan of olives (so why I like this sandwich is beyond me). I always have to order their broccoli/cheddar soup no matter how much I've eaten so always end up stuffed, but well worth the food coma."}
{"text":"Having tried each of the menu items about a hundred times each I feel it's time to express my opinion.  Jason's is special for me since it was one of my first dining experiences when I first moved to Vegas.   I fell in love so much that it became one of my first jobs in vegas as well.  After nearly a decade of its absence from my belly I had an urge and a craving so great I couldn't resist returning to the Arroyo Crossing location to fulfill my hunger pains.  

I knew I wanted a salad from the great Jason's salad bar and I decided to settle on a tried and true appetite satisfier...The Beefeater!  The manager special was the way to go with a 1/2 sammie and salad.  This was not the best Beefeater I have had but it was good. The beef could have been sliced a little thinner in my opinion.  The salad bar was not as bold and beautiful as it could be however it was about 45 minutes before closing time when I arrived bit some of the crocks were half full and staying to dry.  House made muffins were picked over and nearly empty.   

The army of people that are on staff were doing a great job of playing grab ass and not accomplishing much while several dirty tables  were populating the dining room. Oh well, not my monkeys or my circus."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches and service here. 
The hot pastrami with cheddar and aoli is a hit. The people are very service oriented and the place is very clean. 

Came here twice in two days on my visit from Oakland - the REAL and forever home of the RAIDER Nation. I wish we had a Jason's Deli at home for an inexpensive and delish sandwich."}
{"text":"Grub wise, Jason's deli is pretty affordable and the food is decent. No complaints there. The to-go process makes me want to bang my head against a wall tho. About once a month everyone at work decides \"lets have Jason's  for lunch\". I am the person who gets to make this happen. 
First time i saw they offered delivery \"Sweet, right?\" Um no, Its like $8 extra for delivery. Which they don't tell you over the phone. Not cool. On this occasion the money collection at work wasn't adding up so i had to call for itemized sammich prices and only then was i told about the delivery charge. They did wave it since they had neglected to mention it but $8 to deliver 1 mile, no thank you, not doing that again.
So now i call everything in and pick it up myself...not once out of roughly 20 orders has everything actually been correct. Dressings for salads have been left out, menu items missing and sometimes haven't even made it on to the ticket...requests for extra pickles ignored. It's an uphill battle with this place. So, its not to be obnoxious but i have to take everything out before i leave and verify all the food is there. Ive been conditioned. My advice is anyone picking up a to-go order is to do the same.
Like i said, the food is actually pretty good but honestly i don't think grabbing a few sandwiches and salads need to be so difficult."}
{"text":"I totally forgot that  I had written a review for this place. I had not been there for a few years, but visited recently during lunch for convenience sake.

They have made a few improvements. They have a lot of the menu items listed behind the counter but it is not all inclusive. There are also kiosks where you can order yourself

The best kept secret about this place is that to-go salads. Order at the counter and they will give you a large, clear, recyclable plastic container for salad plus two containers for dressing and dessert. You can make a pretty good salad to take with you. The only proteins are hard-boiled eggs which seem to be made off premises and salad topping bacon (not bacon bits though). 

There were fewer kids the two times I visited recently because I went for lunch and dinner during the week. Sanitation grade was borderline low at 90 but acceptable.

I will continue to go back just for the salad bar."}
{"text":"The staff was so friendly and helpful and the food was delicious. It reminds me of a more intimate, healthier Panera Bread. I would definitely go back here."}
{"text":"It's good but it's not THAT good. Typical sandwiches...can't really mess that up. Eh...I've had better. From what I've observed, their service is pretty good but I cannot justify to give them a 4 star. And for the $7.99 meatball sandwich, I can go elsewhere and get something more tasty plus chips and drink would be included.

P.S. I know some of you may like this, especially for the younger kids, but what is up with that cheapo \"ice cream\" machine!?!? Machines like these belong in cheap hole-in-the-wall Asian buffets...not at a sandwich shop. To each their own I guess."}
{"text":"In regards to the food, it was quite delicious and good portions for what you pay. The salad bar was great and had many options. The free ice cream was a bonus as well. 

The menu was a little confusing as only part of it was posted on the wall. The decor is average as well, as it's all over the place.

The seating was ample and the staff was very friendly. It was very clean as well."}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here 1-2 times a week for lunch. Staff is always friendly and the food is always delish. I get the half sandwich and half salad bar deal. I'm obsessed with their couscous salad with cherry tomato and cucumber and the California club on a croissant! Their desserts are good as well."}
{"text":"Very good, clean and quick, busy place at lunch time but they get it right overtime and have a great salad bar, staffed to meet demand and keep it stocked. I visit once or twice a month."}
{"text":"I used their drive thru and it was fast and the order was right and the person helping me with my order was so pleasant. The sandwich (corned beef) was enormous and the brownie so decadent."}
{"text":"This Deli has everything. The service is fast and the dining room staff are so friendly and helpful.  They have a huge salad bar that is very well maintained.  Their sandwiches and soups are tasty too.  Jason's Deli does offer a free ice cream cone!  That was a very cool surprise.  Their food is well prepared and presented and it is a new go to place for me."}
{"text":"I will go as far and say that I would pick the Reuben if I only had one last meal before I died. My favorite sandwich on earth. It never gets old and the portion size is amazing."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Always consistent. Customer facing staff is very professional and courteous. However the staff in the back which is viewable from the ToGo area was flipping each other off and goofing around. Nothing too bad, but still unprofessional.

Wish the menu was a little more \"deli\" traditional. Granted I know it's not a NY deli, but the variety is a little low. Would like to see some Italian style subs."}
{"text":"Food good, decent customer service, wait was terrible.
They have a ton of kids behind the counter working and a very mild dine-in crowd. How did I just wait 20 minutes for a half a sandwich and a small pre made cup of soup?????? Beats me. Ordering online for pickup only now.

At least the cashier was nice and thanked myself and the groups of people in front of me for our patience."}
{"text":"Never disappointed!!!! They have these best sandwiches and they are far from stingy and the pollo Mexican potatoes is the hangover cure  bomb food and ordering again"}
{"text":"Jason's Deli is a place I go when I need to get out of my rut of Sweet Tomatoes or Chipotle.  I normally get the salad bar and soup.  The salad bar is pretty decent, it has all the stuff you can get at any salad bar.  The french onion soup is good.  I would like a little more onions and for it to be a tad bit hotter but all in all it is tasty."}
{"text":"Very impressed by this restaurant. We'd never been but received coupons from church. Food was above board and staff was super friendly. Great value and quality, and free soft serve cones were a special treat."}
{"text":"They seem to always forget my salad dressing whenever I get takeout. I have to remember to check the bag and it's really annoying. Attention to detail is key in a successful food business."}
{"text":"Great food.  Awesome salad bar and everything was fresh and taste.   Great place to have a nice and quick lunch or dinner.   I love the ranchero wrap, it has chicken and jalapenos, cheese, salsa, and sauce that taste great and comes with chips and salsa. The cashier was great and friendly and gave us great customer service. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone who likes good food and great staff and great atmosphere.  Great little deli with good food and great prices."}
{"text":"This was my first time here ...: my friend suggested this place it was \"blah\"

The workers were nice and friendly but didn't help that there were soooooo many tables with dirty dishes all over them kind of nasty when you walk into a place and see dirty dishes just hanging out 

I ordered half Sandwich and half salad salad bar was typical nothing super exciting 

My sandwich was kind of blah it fell apart soon as I took a bite

I'll come back I'm always willing to give places another try"}
{"text":"Came inside for a to go order, the place was messy. Looks like the lunch rush came in but there was no one to bus the tables. But the food that came out was delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always fresh and ready when you go to pick up. It never fails always on top
Of great customer service."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in based on reviews and we were not disappointed . Had the soup and salad and it was filling. Ordered the chicken chili and it was very good! Mini corn muffins made the meal even better! Clean establishment with great  service. Would definitely try them again."}
{"text":"Has really gone downhill in the last few years. Jason's use to be awesome. Food quality and service here has declined dramatically. Still has a great salad bar. Sad to see the decline of a once really good deli."}
{"text":"Great selection, quick in and out, love the free sides that come with your meal. This is one of my favorite hang out spots for WiFi and food."}
{"text":"I have been going to Jason's deli for a very long time. I originally ate there when I was in second grade in Memphis Tennessee. Yeah I know, a long time ago. I love how they are always fresh. The salad bar has crisp vegetables and is always very clean. Their food is flavorful, selling, and organic for the most part! Free frozen yogurt as well with your meal! Who can beat that! My favorite item on the menu is the spud o broc! It's a potato that is full of broccoli cheddar soup!  I had some additions. I add fresh carved roast beef provolone cheese and fresh broccoli to the mix. Holy moly it is amazing!"}
{"text":"Yum.  As far as deli sandwiches, this is pretty much as good as you can get for this price."}
{"text":"Great deli food and fresh choices for the whole family. Great news, kids eat free on Wednesdays after 4!"}
{"text":"Went at 11:30 on a weekday.  Small crowd. Ordered the turkey Reuben (not on menu) with fruit.  Sandwich was good but a little dry. Fruit came with a sweet dip and was delicious. For dessert, I partook in the free lowfat frozen yogurt and mini muffins.
It was very clean and service was excellent.  Salad bar looked delicious.  I wasn't wowed but I would definitely return and try something different next time."}
{"text":"The only thing about this place I wish is that there were more in las vegas. This location is in the middle of henderson and you kind of \"have to want to come here\" but once you do its totally worth it. I get the club royale which has turkey ham and bacon on a crossant - not sure how to spell that. But it's delicious and really worth trying - I've also had the beefeater and that come with au jus - mmmhhmmm!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty amazing sandwiches.  I get the New York Yankee and it is always great.  Big enough for two meals.  Last time my boyfriend and I split one of our sandwiches for lunch and the other for dinner.  They are huge!! They are delicious.  I have only tried a couple so I don't consider myself an expert, I haven't tried the salad bar there really...  It is always packed when I go there which I guess means a lot of people really like it but makes me feel kind of claustrophobic. :S  I would for sure advise people to give this place a chance if they have been pondering it.  I think the food is yummy and satisfying. :)"}
{"text":"Quick, friendly and competent. Decent sandwiches and a nice salad bar that has hummas as well as 6 soup options!
Not a top shelf deli, but beats fast food handily."}
{"text":"Great salad bar as usual. I also got a cup of spicy seafood gumbo soup that was awesome but not served hot(as in warm) enough. I hope I don't get sick."}
{"text":"I really do recommend this place. I would give it 5 stars if it was Carnegie Deli on 7th  Ave in NYC. 
Tonight my wife and needed some dinner. I looked up Jason's Deli menu online. I've been looking for a decent pastrami sandwich for the last 19 months we've been down here in NC. The picture looked interesting.
The first thing I did was grab some packets of brown spicy mustard out of the fridge. All these places south of the Mason Dixon Line use that fake yellow stuff. 
The variety at Jason's is pretty awesome. They have a salad bar-1/2 sandwich and soup combo- huge baked potatoes -plenty of drinks and even have a free soft ice cream machine.
The personal couldn't be more accommodating and friendly.
The system is simple. You order your food at the register. They hand you cups for drinks and a number sign. If you want the salad bar they give you a receipt. You take the receipt to the end of the counter for a plate to get an extensive salad. you get your self service  drinks and sit at a table displaying the number. Your food is delivered to you. They bus the tables after you're done. 
My 1/2 pastrami was pretty good. I must say one of the best down here in NC. It actually had a little fat that boosts the flavor. I hate the Boars Head stuff they call pastrami. The rye bread actually had the consistency of rye, not dark white bread. It was good also. My potato soup was also very good and even served hot.
They even had brown spicy mustard- hallelujah!
I'm definitely making this place a regular stop."}
{"text":"Okay I walked in and was pretty confused about what to do, this being my first time at a Jason's Deli. Thank god I my friend had been there before and directed me to the small cashier booth near the back of the place so we could place our orders. There's a pretty diverse choice of sandwiches, soups, and salads here. Also there's free soft serve ice cream. Who doesn't love free ice cream?!

Our orders came out fast, but I asked for no tomatoes and ended up picking them out of my sandwich. Also when I order a sandwich toasted I kind of expect the inside to not be cold. It kind of throws off the whole texture for me, you know? That being said their sandwiches are huge! It was almost too much meat stuffed into the slices of bread, because I had to take bites from each side so that it wouldn't slip out.

The ambiance I would describe as noisy, and corporate. That's not really an issue though when you are just grabbing a quick bite before heading to a party as I was doing, but for sitting down and enjoying the surroundings I'd recommend somewhere else."}
{"text":"With a menu this big, I haven't had a chance to try even half of what they offer. Couple that with my being a creature of habit, and I can tell you only that the turkey sammiches and broccoli and cheese soup are excellent!

The salad bar is also one of the most extensive I've ever seen in a deli-type restaurant. I generally feel guilty for not making use of such a spectacular salad bar, but the sammiches are so large I could never do both.

And plus, there is the complimentary soft-serve chocolate and vanilla ice cream station to visit before leaving! 

Just make sure you wear your Thanksgiving pants when you eat at Jason's. You will definitely leave stuffed!"}
{"text":"I bought a Reuben sandwich and the corned beef was so full of fat that I threw it away."}
{"text":"I love this Jason's deli! They always have my order correct and the quality is wonderful. I went in today and noticed their score had dropped down to an 88, very disappointed in that but the food service and quality has not seemed to change. Will always keep coming here"}
{"text":"Jason's Delis is a good lunch option. It has something for everyone. Salads, Sandwiches, Wraps, Soups, Pastas... 

Things I really like here are: Soups (French Onion & Chili are my favs), Sandwiches (NY Yankee, Amy O Turkey, Sgt Pepper), Salad Bar (lots of choices), and different flavored iced teas (unsweetened, sweetened, or fruity). I also like the different side options you can sub instead of chips. I usually get fresh fruit because I love their sweet yogurt dip that comes with it. 

Personally I really like this place for the manager special - Half a sandwich and a cup of soup for about $7. I like that you can choose any sandwich you want (the options are endless or you can even make your own) and that they have about 7 different soups to choose from daily."}
{"text":"I love the salad bar here! There are so many extras like little corn bread muffins, specialty crackers and great pickles!  Adding some of the chicken salad to the salad bar trip was a great idea and added the needed protien that is lacking on the bar itself. This is the king of salad bars!"}
{"text":"Very similar place to zupas but 10 times better 
The variety of sandwiches away larger 
They are super busy all the time so you just can come and eat fast 
The salad bar is sick , really fresh and large choices. 
You will get full for sure no meter what you order 
Honestly that was my first time and I can tell all the ppl there were happy . 
They have a nice person there that always clean the place , and the manager was always walking around to make sure everything is full and not missing anything 
The prices are fair 
Go there and give them big like"}
{"text":"Honestly not sure what is so revered about this place. Came here for a quick lunch with a friend and we were thoroughly disappointed.

I went ahead and got the salad bar for $8.29. I thought it would be the best thing to have since I was starving. Sadly there wasn't much appetizing about the salad bar. Very limited selection. For the price you'd be better off heading around the corner to Sweet Tomatoes. The majority of the produce seemed to be straight out of a jar or can. Onions were seemingly fresh and crisp though. They did offer the traditional iceberg lettuce as well as Romain and spinach. Everything else that I tried including the bean salad and the potato salad seem to have been premade and simply dumped into a serving container. The highlight of everything was definitely the cottage cheese. They did have a decent hummus but nothing really to eat it with. They don't offer pita or anything else. And they do have cornbread muffins and brownie muffins. Neither were exceptional. There's also a softserve machine for dessert with a bottle of chocolate syrup to go along with it.

My friend went ahead and ordered a combo which included a grilled cheese and the beef stew. When we were brought out the combo, the person serving us went ahead and handed my friend her spoon touching the part you put your lips too. I was quick to go up and ask for another spoon. We did notice a few other things such as the renter who was running the orders, an elderly lady bless her heart, didn't have the strength to hold the trays out so she would hold the trees close to her body and you could see the sandwiches and such touching her dirty apron. The grilled cheese was very elementary. Nothing to write home about. Beef stew also seemed like he came out of a can was simply heated up.

Honestly this seemed to be on par with hospital cafeteria food. People were somewhat friendly but that's about it. Wouldn't recommend this place for lunch, or even dinner. Plenty of other decent choices around."}
{"text":"The chef salad is amazing! The ranch dressing is soo good! Recommend! Eat here AT LEAST once a week. Staff is wonderful!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would.  I've eaten Jason's for before and it's generally good.  I've even ordered food for delivery, despite the exhorbitant delivery charge and the fact that you have to order at least $20 worth of food to get it delivered.  Tonight though, I was craving something healthy and it occurred to me to order from Jason's again.  The website is kind of difficult to navigate and I found myself having to order things I didn't really want to meet the $20 minimum (a way, I think, to make money...if you want delivery, you're going to pay!).  My delivery got delayed because it took me more than fifteen minutes to figure out how to order my $20 with of food.. And was supposed to be delivered between 7:30 and 8:00PM.  At 7:24, I get a call from the store saying they're all booked up for the rest of the night so they can't take my order... Huh?  They're booked up... For delivery?  What?  Are they Houston's or some other snooty restaurant?  So, what?  If I'd have walked on to order at the counter, would they turn me away because they were \"all booked up\"?  Their excuse was that they only have one driver on Sunday's and their orders are backed up.  And that's my fault because why?  To me, that's horrible customer service.  It's unacceptable, especially when I was forced to order $20 worth of food and they charged me a five dollar delivery fee and then, I had to tip the delivery person.  In total, a simple meal of a sandwich and some soup was going to cost me thirty dollars.  Highway robbery if you ask me...  And poor service to boot.   Not a chance in hell I will ever order from here again..."}
{"text":"I have been going to Jasons for years but the other nite something happened that so impressed me I have to say something.  We did not
want to go out so we called for delivery on 3-11 and we were placing a small order, a muffalatta (omg sooooo gooood) and I have had a bad cough and while I was placing the order the young man said \" oh mam I will be sending you some tea it sounds like you could use a hot tea\" With our order can two cups of hot water, tea packs and hone and it was the very sweetest thing any restaurant has ever done for me. I do not know if it was the manager that night or Gerry who's name is on my receipt, but that has made them my go to now forever.  It helps they have fantastic food"}
{"text":"Customer service is always great, and I love the organic options they have here!! I eat here at least twice a week, and it's consistently good!! Amazing salad bar, great soup selection, and great sandwich and salad options on the menu as well amongst other things."}
{"text":"I still love Jason's but have a couple of complaints about my recent ventures there. First, the salad bar hasn't been stocked up the last few times I have been. One time there was barely any potato salad and another, there was no lettuce. How can you have a salad bar without lettuce?
Second, the Broccoli cheese soup has been hit or miss lately. There have been times it has been delicious, creamy and warm. Other times, it has been too thick and not very hot almost like its been sitting around
Lastly, they need to make sure they are cleaning their fruit properly, namely strawberries. There have been two times now when I ordered a fruit cup and found berries with mud on them. Completely disgusting. 
I am hoping that maybe management at this location will see these complaints and work to correct them. 
Other then these issues, Jason's still remains a solid contender for lunch with me and my co workers."}
{"text":"Ordered online and paid online using gift cards with some money still left for future use left on gift card. The website says to bring gift card with you at pick up. Brought them and the cashier proceeded to take all the money left on the gift cards and then told me I owed $5 more!!!!! She was told they were prepaid online, I have the email verifying it was prepaid using gift cards. She would not return the money. Manager said we have to call the gift card office to get money back. So 27 dollars worth of food, paid 50 for it. Manager said he'd give us the meals for free but did not! Stole every dime from the gift cards. Could not reach anyone in corporate but left a message. Also, several items missing from our order, did not realize till I was already home! Food was mediocre. Extremely disappointed and angry at the foul treatment we received after being customers here for many many years!"}
{"text":"Good food, prompt delivery and good prices.  I used them for a biz lunch and everyone was happy.  I will use them again!"}
{"text":"Love every item on the menu! The staff is great and the French onion soup is a must have for me here! It's quick, healthy and very affordable. It is super close to unlv so it does get really packed during lunch time when school is in session though but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"NOT A DELI!   Its a glorified sandwich shop.   Went there for bacon and eggs one morning only to find out they don't serve it.   Had a sunrise breakfast sandwich.  same sandwich from burger king was better and cheaper.  Don't be mislead by the word \"deli\".      Order and sit down.    counter staff was not friendly and cooks were loud and didn't seem to care about the image,  but, I was the only one in the place mid-morning."}
{"text":"Good food here.  I love the fact that the line is never that bad, the salad bar is fresh, and the rueben is exactly the way it should be.  I had lunch here with a client today, and I have to say the staff at this particular Jason's deli was very helpful.  I even had a worker come up to me and ask if I wanted something to drink when he saw I'd been waiting a while for my appointment to show up.  That is the kind of service that's going to make me choose JD's over another sandwich place.  The free ice-cream definitely isn't a bad touch either."}
{"text":"I've lived in Las Vegas for 11 years and had never eaten here. My friend took me for lunch and I have to say I wasn't that impressed. The soup was good but I couldn't finish my sandwich. Some about it didn't taste right and I'm not one to return food. Maybe I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"I come to this restaurant every time I'm in Las Vegas.  The sandwiches are tasty and made to order.  The baked potatoes are soft and fluffy.  As a previous reviewer stated, the food is consistent (which in this case, is great, because the food is REALLY good)."}
{"text":"I love this place.  People are so nice.

Tried the Johnny Cashew, nothing inherently wrong with the sandwich but it is a pb and j sandwich with turkey and onions.  Not my cup of tea.  Devoured it anyway.

I keep coming here and I have started to hanker for the plane Jane potato.  Great value at this place.

Store is so clean now."}
{"text":"Not the greatest. Soup lady could care more about her job. Serves me a bowl of soup spills part of it and just hands it to me. Didn't know I ordered a half bowl of soup. 
Salad bar passable but not great, lettuce kind of old tasting.  
Person working the tables didn't walk by and take away dirty plates and no one looks to have cleaned the floor. 

Never a big fan of this wanna be deli chain but thought I would give it a try. So much for the try"}
{"text":"This particular location is literally in the same shopping center as a Panera Bread and also a new soup and Salad place called \"Zupas\". It's defiantly got a very tough competition for this location due to these other two places right by one another having way better quality soup and salads. For some reason the quality of the bread and soups and just everything seems to be cheap. Doesn't taste as well as I remember it tasting 2 years ago. I would steer away from this place honestly you could get much better food from the other two honestly."}
{"text":"It's all about the half sandwhich and salad bar. They have really good sweet tea here as well. We came in during a bit of the rush hour. There were a bunch of Boise State players in line. The staff quickly opened up another register and helped us, so the wait wasn't very long at all. I went with the turkey panini which had a nice flavor to it. The salad bar here is by far the best for lunch. They have all of the essentials including those sweet little muffins. You add the free ice cream, and that makes this place an easy 4 stars."}
{"text":"Half sandwhich and salad, plus free ice cream. The average cost of lunch is around 8  dollars and it will fill you up. The salad bar has everything you could ever want, including little muffins."}
{"text":"Never have issues here.  Always great tasting food. Love the option to get half sandwich and salad bar. Ice cream is a nice treat at the end for free. I recommend the papa Joe sandwich."}
{"text":"Yuk! Miricle Mile deli closed which forced to Jasons. Not at all impressed...

Some people LOVE this place but personally they cant touch Miracle Mile Deli..."}
{"text":"As a Jason's Deli goes, this location was fine. The food was tasty, but my soup wasn't as hot as I would have liked. My veggie wrap was great. I had forgotten to order my sandwich with spicy mustard, but the staff was quick in scooping up a good portion so I could mend my error. One of my dining mates and I did splurge on ice cream and added chocolate sauce...yum! Was a little disappointed the machine did not want to provide the vanilla and chocolate swirl of flavors in the typical half and half pattern of soft serve machines, but perhaps it is now corrected. The chocolate sauce in the pump container made up for it."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe the service at Jason's today.  I ordered a 1/4 Muffuletta and My husband wanted a 1/2 muffuletta. The cashier said are you sure, I said yes. Cashier: that's a lot of food......are you really sure? I said, yes that's what he wants. He also wants a cup of spicy gumbo. Cashier: that doesn't come with that sandwich.  I said, yes I know. This was bizarre that I was having to beg to place my order of what we wanted.  These sandwiches are usually very good but today the bread was very soggy to the point of the bread being just mush. They did make a fresh one but between the service and soggy bread, I won't be back for quite sometime, if ever!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday at lunchtime and boy was this place packed! We realized it must have been because Sunday mass must have finished. Not sure if it's usually like this on Sundays... but it was really loud and messy (I'm assuming this was only because it was busy). I would say the food was the same as every other Jason's Deli. I love their unlimited salad bar and free ice cream!"}
{"text":"Was craving a big salad, I've always had Jason's delivered,  1st time stopping in. The staff is great and super friendly and helpful. Good guest service is hard to find, but Jason's has it covered!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I had a cup of southwestern chicken chili (with cheese and onion toppings) and a fruit cup. Both were really good. Fast and friendly service and you get a good amount of food for the money. I also like that they have a lot of healthy options."}
{"text":"I don't understand why to order online with a promise time and whenever it still is 25 minutes after that could have just came in and ordered it as I was here. Customer service was below-par did not get an apology or anything from the manager herself they were not very busy"}
{"text":"This Jason's Deli used to be closer to our house.  Then all of sudden it moved.  My wife and I like Jason's deli that we make the longer trip to the new location.  The salad bar is the best.  We usually get the manager's special and try different sandwiches every time we go.  I really like the the chicago sandwich and my wife gets the reuben.  This place is great!"}
{"text":"always get the Ranchero Wrap - yummy. I also like to add a little side of thousand island at the salad bar to dip the wrap in while I eat it.  At the end...free ice cream!"}
{"text":"Disappointing.... been waiting for this place to open since I first saw the sign in the window and I've heard good reviews from friends who have gone to other Jason's Deli's. So today my sister and I decided to try it out.

First impression is this place is nice and clean with a decent size menu. We both decide to go with the manager's special which is half a sandwich with either a cup of soup OR a cup of fruit with chips and a pickle. I emphasize the \"OR\" because when we get to ordering and my sister tells the girl behind the counter that she would like fruit she tells us that its $2 extra. We point out that the \"special\" is either or and she continues to argue that we would still have to be charged extra...OK...fine...whatever, can we just get the rest of our order in???? Then she asked what kind of soup she would like and again we try to tell her that she doesn't want soup, she wants the fruit instead. Again, the girl tells us that no matter what it comes with soup and the fruit is still extra. On to my order, again I order the \"special\" with a Ruben and not wanting to stand there for another 5 minutes arguing I just order a cup of soup. She then asked me if I wanted rye bread, sour kraut and Russian dressing, at this point I'm thinking \"isn't that what makes a Ruben??\" Instead I smile and just say yes. She then informs me that it would be extra....WHAT?!? She asked if I wanted the chips and pickle to which I said yes. OK that's two strikes which I chalk up to it being newly opened and working out the kinks.

So we grab our drinks and wait for our food to arrive at the table. The food comes and I notice that neither of us got chips and/or a pickle. I looked at the ticket just in case I was wrong but no, it's there. I showed an assistant manager who happened to be close by and his response was \" did they not bring your chips out? Hold on I'll go grab some for you.\" He never came back....strike three. Not coming back EVER!"}
{"text":"It was my first visit there and came especially for their chicken pot pie soup. But they have removed this from the menu, so I chose the potato soup which was very tasty. And don't forget to have a free dessert after your meal! What a nice surprise!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Jason's Deli for the longest time now and tonight was the night we finally got to check it out!

Pros-
- Large, clean, and well lit dining area! This actually came as a pleasant surprise. In a lot of ways it reminded me of Cafe Zupas.
- Very friendly service! The young ladies working tonight were all so helpful and friendly, plus someone was always walking around the floor bussing and cleaning tables.
- An extensive menu with a ton of food options! Plenty of soup, salad, and sandwich options! Plenty of things I want to try on future visits!
- I had the Beefeater(hot roast beef sandwich)($6.99, sandwich comes with either regular chips or baked chips) which was yummy and delicious! My friend had a pastrami sandwich on wheat bread(also $6.99, including either regular or baked chips as well). We each swapped a half of our sandwiches out so that we could try each one. I actually think I liked his pastrami even more than my roast beef! Both were very solid though.
- Free ice cream after your meal! Nice touch and I'm sure I will appreciate this all the more when it is not 38 degrees out!


Cons-
- a tad bit on the pricey side for what you get. At $2.09 each plus tax for the medium sodas, I felt they were overpriced. I would never buy this if I wanted to grab something to go, only if I was going to dine in. Actually, this place seems like it would be best served as a dine in experience only.


I really enjoyed my first Jason's Deli experience and will definitely be returning in the near future to try other menu items.

4 stars.

Yay! I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"This little chain is inexpensive with good food. It features sandwiches, rich soups, salad bar and soft ice-cream that comes with the meal.
I had their beef stew and half a toasted cheese sandwich. The soup will filling though it could have used a little more meat. The sandwich was average. Others in the group said their sandwiches and salads were very good. 
The place was clean and the service was above average. The manager came to the table of a customer next to us to set up a large order for a later date and was willing to customize it for her."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in ages, nice deli sandwich selection and muffulettas. Complementary cornbread muffins, garlic toast, crackers and ice cream!!!!
Staff was extremely nice and made sure we were taken care of with normal essentials."}
{"text":"So impressed with the customer service here! Everyone went above and beyond, had a smile on their face, and was very pleasant. We also enjoyed the salad bar. Next time I'm craving a big salad this will be where we go! And who can beat free ice cream ; )"}
{"text":"What more can I say about this place? It nearly ties with Panera Bread. Great food everytime you go and grubbin' salad bar. The one thing that I was not so keen on was that the line forms where a row of booths are and then sick people lean on the wall of your booth and cough and you really notice it when you are sitting in that booth. Long story short...Don't sit at the booth when you go there to eat."}
{"text":"Good healthy food without the wait. Clean place, friendly healthy employees.  Would come here again.  Nice seating area outside and big dining area inside."}

Welcome to Jason's Deli, a restaurant that does both and is delicious!

Since I am gluten free, I find myself having to cook my own food constantly throughout the week, and I find myself yearning for the days when I could just drive up to a window and get something inexpensive and moderately healthy (or horrible) for my body within 1 minute. After finding Jason's Deli listed in the Celiac Directory in LV, I immediately went online and saw \"GLUTEN FREE BREAD\" in big, bold letters. 

JOY.

I was a bit weary at first because gluten free bread can be awful. Sometimes GF bread is dense, tasteless, pasty or dry, but Jason's bread is DELICIOUS. It tastes like normal bread - nobody would know the difference between regular and gluten bread if you didn't tell them. Their meats and ingredients are processed as little as possible and every single ingredient was fresh, not browned or wilted and just made my tummy sing. 

I purchased their GF smoked turkey sandwich with smoked red pepper and chili aioli, spinach, purple onion strings and tomatoes. Since I got the sandwich to-go, they even put the tomatoes in a plastic container separate from the sandwich so there would be no sogginess when I dug into the meal back at the office.

The turkey wasn't slimey, spinach was fresh, onions were nice and crisp and without that overwhelming red onion smell and that aioli added just the right taste to the sandwich without being too heavy and overpowering. 

The sandwich came with a bag of Baked Lays, but there were options for fruit, hummus and even guacamole and chips. I wasn't in a soup mood, but they do have a GF tortilla soup. Also, if you look on their website you can view all of the allergen information which makes me feel much more comfortable when eating out.

The restaurant is clean, service was very friendly and online order pickup was quick, easy and just what I needed it to be! I will DEFINITELY go here all the time for lunch and dinner - thank you for giving us GF people back our [healthy] fast food!"}
{"text":"I have been to Jason's Deli several times. I want to rave about their Bowl of Red Beans & Rice spiked with chunks of sausage for $3.59 that fills me up. And don't forget the free all you can eat garlic bread slices. This meal has been consistently outstanding since I have had it the last 3 times I have been there.

 A great place to have a leisurely meal. A typical meal with a drink is in the $6-$10 range. I have enjoyed their sandwiches as well on past trips. And who can forget the free soft serve ice cream to cool down your mouth after inhaling the spicy Red Beans & Rice."}
{"text":"Another great fast casual option in the North Hills. Jasons Deli has a great menu very similar to what you'd find at maybe Panera. The menu is much more extensive though and they also have a full salad bar. I've gotten a half sandwich/soup combo. My panini was great. I can't recall the name of it, but it had chicken and pesto. The broccoli and cheese soup is a little thick, but very delicious. I also love the complimentary soft serve ice cream and crackers/muffins."}
{"text":"Food is always good at Jason's. However this location was filthy. The clerk was really nice. Manager walked over and looked at dirty ice cream area and walked away. She also spilled a soup and made the clerk come and clean up after her."}
{"text":"I've driven by the place a number of times and always thought it was just a little corner deli with some tables outside.  But it's got a huge dining room - deceptively large.  If you've got a lot of people looking to eat a simple meal together, this is the place.  The tables can all be moved and put together and it looks like a common occurrence. 

I'd heard the tuna melt was good so that's what I went.  It was fine.  If you're expecting a grease-laden tuna monstrosity, you'll be sorely disappointed.  It was probably more like a tuna sandwich you might make at home.  The bread was a nicely toasted whole wheat, probably a smallish scoop of tuna, a swipe of mayo, some nicely melted jack cheese and a slice of tomato.  The tuna wasn't cold so it must have been heated up but it seemed more like it had gone through one of those giant toaster contraptions they have at Quizno's.  The Ruffles-like chips were a bit better than Ruffles out of the bag but not by much.  My friend had the same so can't really add more about his meal.  

Other people's food looked good.  The staff was nice and patient.  There was a TV tuned to sports with the sound off. The salad bar looked great: extensive and lots of fresh produce (at least it looked fresh)!  They have a lot of soups on the menu.   It looks like they have mostly Coke-products (I'm a Coke-girl) at the self-serve soda area though they had some specialty waters and sodas near the register. 

I'd meet a friend or a group of friends there for a healthy-tasting sandwich."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this location over 30 times, and have had miscellaneous problems with online orders. Today was the worst, though. Put in an online group order with coworkers. Went to pick up 15 minutes after it was due to be completed and had been confirmed nearly an hour before via email. Get there to find the order never made it to be made.  Waited 30 mins to get food, and order was still not complete as they did not turn over the paper for the rest of the order!!!  Then was told they were out of potatoes. Total wait time was 45 minutes to get orders for 5 people, which took my entire lunch hour.  They just lost a customer."}
{"text":"Sick, need the best chicken noodle soup that Mom didn't make?  Come to Jason's! Plentiful moist chicken, plump egg noodles and perfect broth are available everyday for $4 something a bowl. Sick or not I'll drive to pick up a bowl to-go!

My favorite sandwich is the pastrami & turkey on an onion roll, called  \"Bird to the wise\". Lots of pastrami and just a touch of turkey make you feel better about this indulgence.  

Large fresh salad bar, frozen yogurt and bottomless soda machine are just the bonuses. 
Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, but when my son and I went for the first time, I just couldn't.  There was no line so we walked up to the register. I asked if they had a children's menu and got nothing but attitude. I took a minute to read the menu and then attempted to placed our order. The girl at the register was having a conversation with a co-worker and would not stop to take our order. When she was finally ready to take our order, she rolled her eyes at me multiple times because I could not hear her questions over all the noise from the kitchen. 
She then handed me a card with a number on it. I didn't know if we were supposed to wait and pick up our own food. I loomed around and saw some racks on the tables, so I assumed I was just supposed to put the card in and wait for my food to be delivered.
No one mentioned a complimentary snack bar even though it was obvious we were newbies.
Food was so-so. I probably will not be driving from the other side of town just for this food."}
{"text":"I always enjoy Jasons. The salad bar is organic and always fresh. The red pepper hummus is delish. Home made dressings are great too."}
{"text":"so i went in again..just to try it one more time...
it took over 15 mins for the sandwich to be made, then when the manager was bringing it out, he stopped to converse at the table of a former employee...I was at the counter looking for it, to ask that that make it a to-go order, because i was going to be late..when the manager finally made it back with my order, the sandwich was made incorrectly. this wasn't a custom sandwich either, one of they're own creations. So...the manager offered to give me my money back and apologized. I told him of my last experience, and said he could keep his $20 gift card because i didn't want to waste any more of my time in that expensive, bland, so called \"deli\"."}
{"text":"Well, thanks for nothing, Jason. Ordered a Rueben the Great along with a large order for the rest of my office. Great it was NOT! It arrived cold. Not lukewarm. Cold. As in it felt like it was put in the refrigerator prior to being delivered. Now I get that it's going to cool down on the way here but it was seriously too cold to eat. I had to reheat it in the microwave and that just made the meat and bread chewy. Ick. 

No worries, I told myself. I'm always down for a bag of good kettle cooked potato chips. Opened the bag, took out a chip, put it in my mouth, chewed and promptly spit it out. It was stale as all get out. As in 6 months old stale. Best by FEBRUARY 10th. It's August 4th, people!!!!  No joke-I included a pic for proof. My co-workers chips expired in May - so while they may not be as stale-tastic as mine, I'm pretty sure no one wants to eat 3 month old chips. 

The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars and not 1 is that they were on time (actually a bit early which was nice) and the delivery driver seemed like a cool dude. 

Needless to say, I will never order an office lunch from them again. I suppose I may saunter in for lunch inside the restaurant - this way I can hope for a warm sandwich and I can make sure that my chips are fit for consumption. Delivery though? Naw, no way."}
{"text":"I really love the salad bar here and my husband loves the complimentary muffins and ice cream with any purchase so it's a win-win for us.

I have been to this location a few times and it has never steered us wrong. Its always clean (even the salad bar area), it never takes a long time to get food, the service is friendly, and the food is a-okay.  So, as mentioned, I love the salad bar here and 99% of the time always end up getting that option ($8) with an iced tea ($2) and my husband plays around with the sandwich options, this time he opted for the Reuben ($8.29) which comes with a bag of chips, but you can substitute potato salad and one other option for $1.29 (he went with the potato salad) and he got a fountain drink ($2). Our total was $23.81 which isn't bad for lunch, especially when you get all the complimentary goodies from the salad bar such as dill pickles, crackers, muffins, and of course the ice cream for dessert. My husband loved his sandwich and potato salad. He compared it to Chompie's, which is way bigger portioned, but its also way more expensive. 

The salad bar has a good amount of options and it's always clean! Every other salad bar I go to is a hot mess, but someone Jason's manages to keep theirs in tiptop shape. Leaf wise the offer mixed greens that are heavy in romaine, mixed greens heavy in spinach, and just pure spinach leaves. Great toppings including whole hard boiled eggs, bacon bites, cucumbers, onions, carrots, mushrooms, zucchini, tomatoes, different cheeses, and plenty of dressing options.  

This is a solid place to grab a quick bite, nothing fancy or mind-blowing, but just good food. We will be back."}
{"text":"I am absolutely horrified after watching a small black beetle type insect crawl out from the bottom of the salad I was eating, which I had made myself at the salad bar. The manager apologized and expressed that with the organic field greens, sometimes that happens. That is completely unacceptable. That means that they aren't THOROUGHLY washing the produce as they should. We didn't see anyone pull the bin of lettuce after showing them the bug and getting a refund. I'm so bummed we won't ever be coming back here."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! I wanted something decently healthy, cheap, and quick so I decided to try Jason's Deli. I got the turkey wrap and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was! I also got the broccoli cheddar soup which was delicious. The menu has a wide variety of food items to choose from which is great. Only downside - it was kind of pricey considering the amount of food I got. The wrap was realllllly small and wouldn't have satisfied me if thats all I got. However, overall, it was pretty good! Recommended!"}
{"text":"In a hurry? Load up on the salad bar and you'll make out like a bandit!

I hadn't been here in a few years so I figured I would stop by for a quick bite in between errands. I went with the salad bar option and was pleasantly surprised... 

- Fully stocked bar with fresh and crisp veggies
- Quick customer service 
- Very clean restaurant
- All the soft serve ice cream you can sneak out with! 

Plus this place fits my budget perfectly; feeding two people for under $20. I didn't order one, but the sandwiches here look like their stacked high with tastiness. I will be back to try the \"Rueben THE Great\". I mean who wouldn't like a half pound of hot meat on two pieces of bread? ;)"}
{"text":"We went to Jason\"s Deli because we heard that the sanwiches were very good.  They were hugh, and everyone enjoyed theirs.  If you are on your lunch hour, you may want to order ahead because they were very busy around noon."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli has become a weekly visit since moving to Las Vegas. I've enjoyed the California Club, the Reuben, Beefeater, pastrami sandwich, the pasta dishes, P&J sandwich, strawberry shortcake and of course the free soft serve ice cream. All were great. I haven't had any bad experiences yet and the services seems average for the par. I would totally recommend Jason's deli to any of my friends when they come into town."}
{"text":"Walking into Jason's Deli I didn't know what to expect. Is it like Paradise Bakery? Is it like Wildflower Bread Co? The concept of serving sandwiches made from quality bread and fresh ingredients is the same but they serve classic favorites like blt's, meatball, reuben, and club sandwiches. If you want a \"gourmet sandwich\"  with fancy toppings you should probably go to Paradise or Wildflower. They also offer wraps, stuffed potatoes, po boys, soups, and a salad bar but it didn't look very good.  I ended up ordering ciabatta garden sandwich because It was  one of the few vegetarian options they had there. The sandwich was really flavorful and filling . My sister ordered the Reuben sandwich and it was huge! I don't eat meat but that sandwich looked really good. My sister also suggested we try out their cheesecake and it was delish!  I was surprised it was pretty authentic not one of those to go slices that tastes like Jello cheesecake.  We were very satisfied and will be coming back for more :)"}
{"text":"Came here around 7pm on the 3rd for my birthday.  Chose this place for their gluten free friendly options.  Salad bar was severely lacking- had to keep asking for replacements, veggies weren't fresh, muffins were hard.  Ice cream machine had no cones.  So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Empty stomach+Pastrami Melt Po Boy=Full stomach=Nap time."}
{"text":"This deli is amazing good. From the food, salad bar and service are 5 stars. Just make sure you come with your stomach empty. My favorite is the chicken pasta primo and their chocolate chip cookies are some of the best I've ever tried."}
{"text":"I like Jason's Deli. I'm not real picky but I just don't understand why this place doesn't have better reviews.  I love their salad bar because it is simple yet always super fresh with a good amount of dressing options.  Their sandwichs have always impressed me and the soups are great and made fresh everyday.  They are a no trans fat place and most of their stuff is organic.  I think its great but maybe I just suck. Who knows."}
{"text":"Nice reliable spot for the uptown lunch crowd. Cashiers are friendly. Layout of the takeout spot is bad. After ordering at the cashier there is no good way to get around the the fountain for drinks without going back outside the takeout door & in the other door. To the do it back in reverse to pick up food. Favorites are: meatball sub, \"plain Jane\" (which isn't plain!) potato, & BLT. Food is prepared pretty quickly... About is quick as possible without being prefab food."}
{"text":"Craved a Corned Beef sandwich.  Well that's what I got but pretty blah. 
Not the Best. 2nd visit in the 12 years I've lived here and might be another 12 years before I try again.  But the staff was Great."}
{"text":"Food here is amazing as always no complaints there. Strolled in at 820p, shop closes at 9. Cashier Aj, states clearly that the salad bar will be shut down soon and if we we were sure we wanted to dine in. Ya, we are sure. Pokemon hunting all day takes a toll. We order our food, and with every ounce of sarcasm that one could muster up insists that we have a great rest of our day. While consuming our food, the phone rings and he says oh great, another call. Takes the order, customer walks in and he looks at the clock and is even more irritated.I've never seen the white of someone's eyes so much as I did while eating tonight. I could hear them roll each time. I get it, it's Saturday night and you want to go home. But please don't make your loyal customers feel like they are an inconvenience. Aj, please lose the tude!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in quite a while, and now I know why. It was 5 PM on a weeknight and there was only one other person in the entire restaurant. I remember the days when the line was so long it went all the way back the entire length of the restaurant. It was dirty in there. The salad bar was dirty, the soda machines had sold us Blash stop all Llover and ice comes out,, and the food was awful. I would have left based on cleanliness but I was with someone else and our children and I didn't want to make a big deal of it. I wish I had. I got half sandwich and he won a trip salad bar. The salad bar was dirty with a lot of items missing or mixed in to other containers from people dropping it and it not being cleaned up. The sandwich was so bad and it's the same one I have always ordered. The bread was completely dried out. I actually took it back up to the counter and they talked to three other workers about it before deciding to make me a new sandwich. I told them I didn't even want it, It was that bad. Why would they have to speak to someone else to replace the sandwich that had two bites taken out of it? Now I know why we were the only people in there"}
{"text":"This place is really good . But kind of pricey , but there sandwiches are awesome. I also love the free ice cream and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love this place, wrapini .... Sooo good! Please open one in orange county!!!!! Free muffins and soft serve! Oh and I left my phone at the table and the staff was nice enough to keep it for me! Xoxox!"}
{"text":"Love this place I just wish they didn't move from bell, this location is a bit far for me."}
{"text":"I haven't had anything from here that I didn't like.  The portions are huge (OMG, have you seen their baked potatoes?!?).  The muffaletta and club royale are my favs."}
{"text":"Jason's is at top of my list for delis around my house.  Jason's is nice & clean, and offers plenty of seats for the fast casual crowd.  They have a few organic stuff and really push for the healthier fare.  Depending on what you get portions are good size for the price you pay.  My favorite is the beef eater po boy with dipping au ju. Hubby gets the Great Reubon & NY Yankee both are loaded with tons of meat for $7.29.  They have a good selection of fresh brew teas and other bottle drinks. The kids menu includes the usual fare of mac & cheese, but I love the salad bar & pasta bow tie/meat ball options.  The free soft serve ice cream is a bonus!  On Wed nights, kids eat free. I have 2 kids & with 1 paid adult they both get to choose something from the kids menu...that's an awesome deal!"}
{"text":"Good spot for lunch with lots of options from a make your own salad to sandwiches, soups, and pasta.  Not to mention free soft serve ice cream at the end."}
{"text":"When getting lunch to go they aways have good food and a large portion, too large usually so I have to share. would like them to not charge for delivery since we are across the street and always tip the driver. we would go more often if there was better prices with less food for those of us who dont eat 1000 calories a meal"}
{"text":"My recent visit at Jason's Deli I ordered the chicken panini. The bread was hard and a little burned. The sandwich was very dry. Not worth the price. Tried the soup and it was cold. Will not go back there. The other two people with me said they will not return neither."}
{"text":"I've come here for lunch before and always found it pretty good. Tonight for dinner it was pretty bad. I got a soup and salad combo, really basic. I was told the soup will be at the end of the counter along with my salad plate. I get down there and wait and wait and wait. Every employee who passes by I say \"excuse me\" but they all run off. Finally I track one down and directly ask for my soup and salad plate. He apologized and was nice. I watched him pour my soup from a soup station and it did not look clean at all. Soup splatters everywhere....ok what ever. 
I park at a table and head for the salad bar. Messy and sloppy bar station. Some decent sections and a few good times (red bell peppers and beets...nice) but the rest? not so much. Spatters everywhere and some bins were empty. I make my salad and head back. I try the soup (lobster bisque) tasty but barely warm. Then I notice a hair on a mushroom. Okay, not their fault necessarily, but it def put a damper on everything at this point. After I eat the salad and head to get the free ice cream from the self serve station. Again it was messy with a tub of run off that looked like it was sitting there for hours. I also grab a mini muffin and it was totally stale. 
Maybe an off night but this place needs a good scrub down from top to bottom. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, a lot of healthy options with a decent salad bar. It's a great casual place to go. The shaved ice place nextdoor is also amazing. I wish they had outdoor eating here though, that would be nice."}
{"text":"Love the food. Tyler who took our order is so nice and made us feel welcome today!  The food was amazing. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This location of Jason's is stellar. Tucked away in the epicenter, its my \"go to\" spot for a touch of New York City in the form of a hot pastrami sandwich  complete with some spice mustard. The salad bar is well stocked with all the usual favorites and the staff does s good job of keeping it clean as well, even thru the midday lunch rush of uptown Charlotte. I am also a big fan of Jason's Spud Au Broc, a baked white potato
covered with broccoli cheese soup, cheddar,  broccoli, bacon, green onions...delicious. Note the broccoli cheddar soup is a winner also. And don't leave without your cone or cup of ice cream...as one employee there told me \"make sure your cone is at least 4\" high\""}
{"text":"Was privy to eat lunch here several times this week.  The pastrami sandwich is a golden throwback to NYC deli pastrami sandwiches,  complete with some spicy brown mustard....  And the ice cream wins you over also..."}
{"text":"Hands down for the zucchini sandwich! It's beyond delicious! I ordered with seasonal fruits and it came with a tasty vanilla yogurt dip! Loved it!"}
{"text":"How does one not love a Jason's Deli?

The sandwiches, wraps and paninis are wonderful and they have a lot of options for kids and vegetarians. Even gluten free variations.

The soups are fun and creative

The deserts are great

The salad bar has BEETS, hummus, pasta salad and 2 types of quinoa salad. Seriously.

They have the cutest little cornbread muffins

AND they have free ice cream. FREE ICE CREAM

Just stop already

I love this place and it never lets me down. No matter what I'm in the mood for. If I'm in the area, I look forward to it every single time.The food is great and the service is fast. Can't beat that with a stick.

Did I mention the thing about the ice cream?"}
{"text":"Jason's Deli ... Good place for a salad and sandwich


I have visited a few of the  Jason's Deli's around town, and have eaten at the Jason's  Deli, Metro Center location  several times. Every visit to any of Jason's Deli restaurants has always been a great experience.


I cannot seem to stop myself from ordering the fruit platter every time I visit Jason's. The fruit is always fresh and the fruit dip is delicious.   I always want to try something new but always  get caught up ordering the fruit platter. My lunch companions  ordered several different items off the menu, and there were  no complaints.

The staff at Jason's Deli is friendly, accommodating,  and the service is always quick.  Jason's Deli has a large drink selection, and you get a complimentary soft-serve ice cream cone with your meal.  Can you think of a better way to finish a meal?

If you're going to eat at Jason's, try to get there early in order to beat the lunch crowd. The Metro Center location is always busy, and draws a large crowd."}

{"text":"Been there, done that.  Fair sandwiches (better than Safeway, anyway).  Only 2 stars since I didn't know about the free soft serve, so didn't get to try that.

There's gotta be a good New York-style deli west of the 17 and north of Thunderbird.  Isn't there?  Doesn't have to be great.  Good would be wonderful."}
{"text":"This is a great little sandwich/soup/wrap shop!  They have lots of genuinely healthy options, a variety of vegetarian choices, really nice fruit, a nice salad bar, and yummy all-you-can-eat frozen yogurt.  It's definitely affordale, and the service tends to be really friendly and quick even when busy."}
{"text":"Definitely a favorite Lunch spot! My friends and I eat here often. Yummy sandwiches, soup and salad- all for a really great price. I love the newly remodeled look and open seating, specially the patio area when the weather is nice. The staff is friendly and helpful, which is always a plus for me. 

Be warned the portions are very generous! The Muffalettas are no joke! Their salad bar is a great option if you're not sure what you're in the mood for. Trying out the day's special is usually not a bad choice either. The only complaint I have is that I really like their pasta & meatballs except they no longer have spaghetti- only bow-ties and penne now. I hope they bring back spaghetti!!! 

Enjoy their complimentary mini muffins and end your meal w/ their free low-fat frozen yogurt!"}
{"text":"Great Rueben sandwich! The corned beef was great. Only thing is that it's a little pricey. $9.50 for a sandwich and chips is a little high."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location with no problems, delicious food with friendly prompt service. So I stopped in to get lunch today for two a couple bowls of soup with two sandwiches. Everything was fine but once I got to my friend's place, no chips. So I call to tell them and the woman on the phone challenged me about what I ordered, my name and other details. Like I go around to Jason's Delis cheating them out of their chip supply?? No apology and ask what did I want her to do about it? Since I am now across town can I maybe get my chips in a couple of hours? Sure. Okay well thanks for nothing. I guess basic courtesy and manners are not on their menu. Keep your chips and I'll keep my money."}
{"text":"I haven't visited this location, but I've been served two of their fine \"mini\" reuben's for lunch this week. They make a damn good reuben."}
{"text":"I came in with my boyfriend at 11:30 AM today. I ordered the 1/2 size Meatballa sandwhich ($5.99) with Glueten free bread (.29 charge for half).  He had the Manager's special 1/2 size Ham sandwhich with chips and a cup of chicken soup. His meal was $7.29 plus the fountain drink we shared for $1.99... The total came to $16.82.  Which is better than most places but I still expected more from the food I guess.

I felt bad for my boyfriend, he said the chicken soup wasn't great, but enjoyed his ham sandwhich. My sandwhich was delicious. It's an average chain sandwhich shop... But atleast the host Katherine was nice and polite. And they didn't screw up the food."}
{"text":"Jasons Deli has always been my favorite deli place to have a quick meal before returning to work or even just on certain occasions! I wish they had more locations here in Vegas! The big chef salad is usually my favorite but I went with this ranchero grilled chicken wrap! Not too bad.."}
{"text":"On a rare day off for both myself and my wife, we decided to try and find someplace we'd never been for lunch. Sandwiches are always a popular choice, but we have tried so many sandwich places, we weren't sure where to go. 

We didn't really even need to consult Yelp this time, as there are so many different eateries on every corner in Scottsdale, all we had to do was drive around until we found one that sparked our interests. On this day, it was Jason's Deli.

When we walked in, we were surprised at how big this place was. I mean, the counter alone was about as long as one of the meat counters you'd find at a supermarket deli counter. Very impressive. Under the glass, you'll find all of the available meats and vegetables, as well as the wide array of fruits they offer.

The menu is pretty typical of what you'd find at your typical deli. Different styles of sandwiches and wraps, offered with different meats and veggies, as well as fruits, salads, and drinks. But for us, what caught our eye was the \"Local Favorites\" section. If you're new to this place (like we were), and you're not one to stand in line forever and try to figure out what you want, this might be a great place for you start your search. If you don't see exactly what you want on this list, it will at least give you a nice jumping off point for something that sounds good to you.

On this day, we saw the turkey wrap on the Local Favorites board. We both agreed that it sounded delicious, and we were definitely right. For both wraps, we paid $18. The wraps came with a refillable fountain drink, fresh fruit, and a delicious yogurt dip for said fruit.

We wanted to sit on the patio, but being that it was completely shaded at mid day, there was no seating to be had. So, we ended up sitting at one of at least three dozen available seats inside. Sitting inside wasn't bad, though. There are several televisions in the background, and you're only a few steps away from the salad bar. Oh yeah...did I mention that they have a salad bar? Because they totally do."}
{"text":"We love Jason's Deli and there ice cream. It's a good place to go and get a healthy sandwich during a lunch break."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place....there is always some unknown force that drives me here to lunch frequently. The food here is great and I  have yet to try many items on the menu, but I can't stray away from my two favorite sandwiches. Don't get me wrong, I am pretty adventurous when it comes to exploring new options but I think it might just be because my addictive personality/palate always seems to be exposed when I am here. With that said, here are the two sandwiches that have caused my addiction to this place:

1. The Muffalettas: I can't seem to find a good muffaletta outside New Orleans but this one definitely makes up for that. The sandwich is enormous....fresh ham, salami, provolone cheese and a kick-ass olive spread that I wish I could bottle up and take home with me.

2. The New York Yankee: This sandwich is so good!!....but why does it have to be called a New York Yankee???

New York Yankee Sandwich = a winner in my book/ tastes great
New York Yankees = losers in my book/leaves a bad taste in my mouth

Doesn't add up....but I guess the fact that the baseball team is in second place/behind by about 20 games and this sandwich is my second fav. actually does!! Whew...thank God it's just a sandwich!!  Two of my favorite deli meats, corned beef and pastrami with swiss ( I always order extra cheese...tastes great) on rye. Because I am also addicted to sweet tea, I always order one to go with this sandwich and muffaletta. Theirs is the best way to wash the food down and drown out the fact that I actually like a Yankee....God Help Me!!"}
{"text":"I've often heard of Jason's Deli but never really had the hankering to try until my friend France R. was actually in that side of town and was looking for some healthy food for our dinner. I don't think there could have been a better choice in the area. Just options for every type of taste bud! What surprised me the most was the variety of foods that  they offered. I came in thinking \"typical sandwich place...OMG tomato soup!?\" It's definitely a place that I can keep revisiting and not get bored of because they have so much to offer."}
{"text":"Came with my Army Reserve Unit with about 30 people. They took our order very fast and our food came out very fast. Food was also really good. Awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy. Soup, salad bar, baked taters, sandwiches. Great varieties of each available daily. Get the soup & sandwich combo. Fave soup: chicken noodle. Fave sandwich: Beefeater. Staff is always friendly and helpful and restaurant is always well maintained. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Jason's deli is the best! Every thing I had was good. I only wish there was one in our town. I will be hunting them down where ever we go!"}
{"text":"Went to this to grab a quick bite to eat.    Service was quick and fast and food was great!   And there is free ice cream!"}
{"text":"I've been to this particular Jason's on multiple occasions.. It's a fantastic place to pick up a great sandwich on the fly with a super clean interior and excellent and consistent staff.. Plus the tomato basil soup is the best I have ever had anywhere.."}
{"text":"The beefeater is the sandwich of champions.  Unlike the joke you get at Subway they pile on the yummy beef!  It comes with chips but they only play a minor role.  The star of the show is the massive beef Po Boy sitting in front of you.  Paired with some amazing Au Jus this treat makes lunch a meal to remember.  
  My only disappointment with Jason's is they are not in California.  So when I am on travel I check to see if there is a Jason's nearby.  No matter what city you are in if there is a Jason's and you love delis line I do then you must give them a try.  I have tarried then at 15 different locations and have never been let down.  The Beefeater Po Boy calls my name soon as I walk in!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Jason's Deli in 10 different states.  I usually get the Beef Eater Po'Boy which is a great sandwich!  They use quality beef and the sand which comes with some great au jus.  The au jus has a rich deep taste and compliments the sandwich perfectly.  
   The wife gets the salad bar which has tons of items to choose from.  She really enjoys the tortellini pasta which has a light Italian dressing taste.  The potato salads are all very tasty.  The salad selection is very good too with red leaf and romaine lettuce available.
   The free corn and ginger mini muffins are so awesome.  Despite the very fulfilling Beef Eater Po'Boy I save room for one of each of them.  You can also get a soft serve ice cream cone to go.  I never do due to the Beef Eater filling me up.
   We have tried many of their soups and the gumbo, chicken noodle and chicken pot pie are the stand outs.  They are fresh tasting and well worth the cost.  
   I like Jason's due to the consistency of their franchises.  This franchise is well run with a friendly staff and clean dining room.  For just a couple dollars more than Subway you can have actual meat on your sandwich!"}
{"text":"DEDICATED GF menu makes it clear it is NOT for celiacs or those with lifelong autoimmune disease but fine if only gluten sensitive.  Offer GF bread too. Tasty meal."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and salad bar, a tad pricey for items."}
{"text":"Well, we gave it two more chances. The first one, mid December, was a little better. Staffing seemed to have improved and our sandwiches came out faster. However still no au jus with my sandwich until I asked for it. We decided to give it another try in the hopes that they had read the review and we're trying to improve.
Went back last Saturday, January 2nd. Regrettable decision. We waited to order as no one was at the cash register for a few minutes. Finally ordered. Even though we both know the routine, asking for our \"managers special\" with side salad, regular chips and water to drink. The order taker asked each of us to repeat everything after what type of sandwich we wanted. He obviously wasn't paying attention to our order even though no one was in line behind us. It was unusual, but he gave us a take out cup for our water. Went to the salad bar or what was left of it, remember we are always there around the same time 6:15 or so. I again had to find someone to fill the mixed greens and a couple of other items that were out that I wanted. Another customer then asked them to fill a few more items. We sat down after searching for a clean table. There were about 10 of the more popular booths that were unoccupied but had dirty dishes and leftover food items on them. Sat down next to another customer that I recognized as being a Saturday regular. While waiting for my wife I made the comment to her that the service at this location had really gone downhill in the past few months. She heartily agreed and pointed out that she had gotten take out cups for her water the last two weeks and didn't like it. She had asked the manager why and he told her that he didn't have enough staff to keep up with the dishwasher for the cups. She was wondering herself what else they were letting go.
Needless to say we're done with this place and will go to Wildflower or the new Panera in Gainey Village. It's interesting to me that no manager from this location or from corporate has ever responded to this posting. Maybe none of them care about customer service?"}
{"text":"I ate here today. I ordered a \"Mediterranean\" wrap. It was okay, except for the fact that I had to send it back and have it remade due to the 3 curly brown hairs adorning it as a garnish. That was pretty sick, but the staff was really nice and I liked the fact that they had low calorie options. All in all, it is a commercial space, nothing unique, but a decent place for a casual lunch."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch especially since my office is upstairs. Service is good, food is good, and there is always that little treat afterwards."}
{"text":"I got sent here on a tip from a friend for a good lunch/deli spot.They did not disappoint, I had a turkey reuben off the healthier side of the menu. You have the option of a few different sides all of which were delightful. The selection of menu items was very extensive and the salad bar was huge. Give it a try if you havent already."}
{"text":"I like the layout of Jason Delis. The pricing is not bad and the food is fresh and tasty 

I opted for the Muffalata Sandwich meal. Although loaded with a billion and one calories, my fat rear end enjoyed it immensely! 

The slightly toasted sesame bun and smattering of olives on my deli meats made this sandwich rock!

Chilling out right off of Scottsdale Road isn't bad either because get to see all of these women driving fine rides who think they are the bomb. When actually they crave hanging with a bad boy and shredding! Makes me chuckle inside.

Anyway, this is a great reasonable stop for lunch. Fresh, good, and many options to choose from. Check them out. Peace, love and Bobby Brown!

{"text":"i enjoy that food at jason's deli. it's nice to have an escape from all the fast food places that litter every street corner, so i will give 2 stars to the food at this establishment. BUT, the service at this jason's deli is awful. once i stood waiting to order while 2 employees ignored me to finish their conversation and then when i finally said something they acted annoyed and bothered that i wanted to order something. i would say that a good 78% of the employees usually look that they absolutely hate being there and could not give more attitude to customers if they tried."}
{"text":"I love the penne pasta and meatballs.  Best \"spaghetti\" in town when they don't microwave it which is rare.  So usually it rates a 2.5 stars with the microwave.  

Muffaletta's are awesome.  I feel in love with these in 2001.  Their rueben sandwich is also very good.  

Most of all, I love going to the salad bar here.  I've been going to this location for months now.  Good stuff.

French Onion soup is okay.

The bbq brisket spud is so sweet it tastes like cheap candy on a baked potato.  Yucky.  1-star.  On the plus side, the baked potato is huge and looked fairly fresh.  When people order bbq brisket, they expect a bbq flavor and not overwhelming cheap sugar taste.  I could not taste any real brisket in there.

The Rachel.  Decent.  3 stars.  Toast was burned and hard as rock and not that much flavor in the sandwich itself.

Update: Red Beans and Rice Soup. 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Had salad bar and Cuban sandwich. The Cuban was quite good. It met me taste expectations of what a Cuban should taste like. Salad bar was loaded with goodies. Basic greens as well as spring mix. Wide assortment of dressings like low fat ranch and balsamic vinaigrette. Whole beets, mushrooms, carrots, cucumber, antipasto, potato salad, etc. if the prices were a little cheaper I'd give 4 stars. $8 for a small sandwich and plain ruffles is a little more than I'd expect to pay. But the food is good."}
{"text":"I really like Jason's deli and especially the scottsdale location. Their customer service is outstanding!!! The staff is all very friendly and despite the high traffic that they get, their service is fast. It is also very week maintained and always clean, especially the salad bar area which sometimes can be gross and not picked up, but not here, always very clean!"}
{"text":"I like this place more than my boyfriend does. We've had them deliver a few times, and even though it seems expensive for deli food, the quality has always been decent, and I appreciate the delivery. The quantities are huge. The muffalettas are yummy and gigantic!"}
{"text":"The service is exceptional. I have been asked if I've been helped three times while waiting for my order. Matt is slinging a phenomenal job! Thanks Matt!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! I wish I would have tried this place sooner....great food and (really) friendly staff!  I had the best Muffuletta sandwich outside of the French Quarter!!! It was big and tasty and had everything that I wanted between two pieces of bread! I LOVED their olive salad.....yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Not to bad.. not to bad at all.. you know me and chain restaurants don't get along very well. So when I was invited here by a friend I had already made up my mind not to hate this place but let it suck on its own. 

I ordered the Smokey Jack Panini based on my friends recommendation. Crunch toasted bread.. smokey bacon and turkey.. guacamole and tomatoes.. what else could top this off, a slice of pepper jack cheese. It didn't fucking suck!  Now the free ice cream, that sucked! 

Might try it again for the salad bar.. looked very fresh and well stocked."}
{"text":"Really good sandwiches and food here... Great to grab office lunch for the group for meeting day treats to boost morale....

Service and prices are good. 

Worth a taste....

You will want to return for more!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but I don't understand the purpose of the Jason's deli app.  The last 4 orders I've placed haven't been ready when I give the standard 15 mins to come pick it up.  This last time I waited longer, so that it might be prepared when I arrive (off peak hours, 3pm ish).  In fact, they always have my order, but wait for me to arrive to begin making it.  Normally when a restaurant offers an app to order, it is designed as a time saver, but apparently this does not apply for this Jason's deli location.  I also use my CC online to pay, but every time they need to swipe my card and run it at their register.  Be nice if they introduced some convenience and efficiency to their online ordering system."}
{"text":"Best deal in town, fresh food. I come here 3-4 times a week and was just given a free lunch because they recognize me, not even a loyalty program, just here you go!

Managers Special is half a sandwich and either soup or salad bar. Free soft serve ice cream for every patron, they even offer nuts and chocolate syrup toppings free of charge.

Check them out if you pass one of their locations!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Jason's Deli Saturday while on vacation in South Carolina last weekend. This was a perfect lunch spot that could satisfy a lot of different appetites. A number of the menu items sounded SO good but I decided to go with the salad bar so I could try a little of everything there. 

The salad bar was clean and had lots of goodies to choose from. Loved the couscous salad they had there. You can definitely fill up on just the salad bar alone and for a good price. 

The restaurant was busy but were able to order right away and the two ladies I was with received their food quickly. As soon as we were finished a nice guy was ready to clear our plates. 

Looking forward to my next trip to SC to check out this place again!"}
{"text":"One of the only restaurant in the Metro Center area who still manage to keep really good customer service skills despite the population"}
{"text":"overall a pretty good restaurant. they don't have any specials for lunch which is kind of a bummer. I recommend getting the ranchero wrap or the plain jane potato."}
{"text":"Ok, so I am not usually the type of person to leave negative reviews (I prefer to leave suggestions for places I love rather than bagging on places) but this was just too much today. 

I have been going to different Jason's Deli locations for probably 16+ years. I love the sandwiches but mostly, I am a huge fan of their salad bar. 

Today, I brought in a friend to have lunch with me. She had never been there before and we both got the salad bar. Along with my salad, I got a few spoonfuls of banana pudding. In my second bite of banana pudding, I discovered a stink bug by BITING into it. Its nasty little bug guts exploded into my mouth (which is why I know it was a stink bug, as well as the clearly identifiable pieces of bug I spit out after.) 

I made management aware, but the poor girl really didn't seem like she knew what to do to handle the situation. So they gave me some free cookies for my \"inconvenience,\" which is a nice gesture, but it doesn't quite make up for biting into a bug. This incident made me particularly upset because this was a chain I trusted to provide a consistent and positive experience every time. Definitely wasn't a good first impression for my friend, either. 

It makes me sad, but I'm going to have to find a new salad bar to frequent. 

I have attached pictures of my little stink bug friend who crashed my pudding."}
{"text":"Their food and menu selection is pretty good; however, the reliability of their delivery is next to nothing. I have ordered delivery from them five times for a lunch meeting, and three of the five orders have been delayed or incorrect in one way or another. We actually stopped using them for our lunch meetings (because even if you placed an order at 9:30 or 10:00am, they could not guarantee a 12:00 delivery time), but today I figured I would give it another shot. Enough time had passed, surely they've worked out the kinks, right? Wrong...

I place the online order at 10:20 for lunch delivery at 12:00pm (I figure an hour and a half is enough notice to have 6 sandwiches prepared and delivered) - immediately following I get an email from the catering manager, Maggy, who tells me that they won't be able to prepare and deliver the food in time, but that it would be here between 12:30 and 12:45. No worries. I will give my team a heads up. So I step into my meeting and go about my day. At 12:20 (Mind you, a full TWO HOURS after I placed the order AND got a confirmation email from the catering manager that they had received the order and would have it delivered), they call and leave me a message saying that they do not make one of the sandwiches on the menu anymore and that they needed to know what we would like as a replacement. I get the message 10 minutes later when I step out of the meeting to check on the status of the delivery. So at 12:30 I found out that not only is our lunch not here, it's also not on the way because they need to know what we want as a replacement for the Johnny Cashew sandwich.

We've adjusted for the two hour delay, but it seems pretty ridiculous that not one single person (not even the manager who sent me the order email saying that she'd have our order delivered just a little bit later than requested) could bother to look at the order itself to confirm that they have the items in stock to make the menu items available - nor have they had them for a \"long time.\" 

So if you have the time or freedom to visit the store itself, absolutely give it a shot. But if you need to cater a lunch meeting - go somewhere else if you want to make sure the correct order is there at the correct time. Completely unreliable."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery. The food was on time but we had to order 25 dollars worth then there was a 7 dollar delivery fee.. There shouldn't be a fee if there is a max amount needed to be purchased. Also the food was also pretty bad. Won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"One of our family's favorite places to eat! Salad bar is  the best in Charlotte. Love the sandwiches."}
{"text":"I am going to have to give bipolar reviews.

On site:
Pretty good, especially for a Portillos like dine in but with much more deli options. Loved the complementary frozen yogurt! I always have room for ice cream :)

Catering....
Ok, how does putting a 1/2 lb of meat on a low quality sliced bread from a bag count as a sandwich to be proud of? What happened to lettuce, cheese, a tomato? Why do you put Jason's Deli stickers on your Lay's Potato chip bag? No matter what sticker you put, it was still Lays that did all the work.  The cookies are decent.  Veggie wraps are pretty good but would be much more awesome with some feta or goat cheese or even better if you take some of the massive amount of meat from the mediocre sandwich and put that it there. Also, why do you never check off the type of cookie on the box? I hope you are a good deal. Paradise bakery boxes put you guys to shame."}
{"text":"This place did a miraculous turnaround.   We decided to give it another chance, and I'm glad we did.  The place was SPOTLESS.   It was actually the cleanest I've ever seen a Jason's Deli.  The service was very fast, friendly and very good.   My Dad had a 1/4 Turkey Muffaletta and a salad from the salad bar.  I had a baked potato.  All of it was very, very good.  I wasn't a fan of the iced tea, which was the first time I had it there.  It just had a strange taste.  That is the only reason I give it four stars, instead of five.   But, definitely a MUCH better experience than the first time I was there.  Good job cleaning things up!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to learn that this place was opening close to my house. There is a location near my work that I just love....

Having said that .... I was disappointed upon eating at this location. It is brand new so of course everything is going to be neat and clean .... bonus! All the staff is super friendly and attentive....

But the food .... bummer!  I had my favorite turkey wrap and it was very bland and the tortilla was hard, the fruit cup was moldy and not so tasty.

They have a lot of different food options so I plan on going back .... hopefully I won't be disappointed this next time because I would hate to have to take this place off of my food rotation."}
{"text":"At home tasting food and relaxing atmosphere. We got here after the lunch rush. We definitely will come again. The salad bar was satisfying. I wish there were soups but u pay extra for soup. My husband loves the cheddar broccoli soup. It's a winner!"}
{"text":"I loooove this place! I'm surprised it has mediocre reviews - I've never had a bad dining experience here. Well, if you decide to go, order the Mediterranean Wrap... all you need to know is that it's made with HUMMUS! You also get a trip to the salad bar (which consists of tons of goodies) when you order the lunch special. The girl at the counter is sweet, too... she helped me with my mess of an order (as usual) and substituted everything I wanted. Repeat customer, most def."}
{"text":"A decent sandwich place. The pastrami sandwich was good and I like that I can get baked chips instead of normal chips with the combo."}
{"text":"My first time coming here and the food was fantastic! The only questionable thing is they don't have the full menu displayed to make ordering easier???"}
{"text":"This is one of the most accommodating places I have ever had the pleasure of dining.  The staff is fantastic... I come with my two dogs and sit outside on the patio and everyone is always checking on us, offering water right when I get there for my babies and the food is so fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"This is a great alternative to fast food. I have only had the salads. They use fresh ingredients and offer several different salads, soups and sandwiches. I tried the new salmon salad and wouldn't get it again. Only because the salmon is drier than I prefer. 

PROS: Pineapple Chicken salad
            Nutty Salad
            Fresh ingredients
            Free ice cream while you wait."}
{"text":"1st experience-  Decent sandwich; would return.

2nd experience-The salad bar was surprisingly good; would return.

3rd experience-Very un-tasty sandwich, would only return for the salad bar."}
{"text":"Out in Hendertucky, and you knew I needed to stop by this place. Too bad the ice cream is out of order!!! Ugh. Well, maybe a good thing. I need to eat less ice cream. However, the bonus was everything is always fresh and made exact to order. They have tons of options and everyone is absolutely friendly every time i come out."}
{"text":"Awesome salad bar with great selections. They have a nice computer feature if you're getting the salad bar and paying with credit or debit. Skip the long line and head to the kiosk on the right."}
{"text":"Spicy seafood gumbo = divine! I ordered a cup of that and the salad bar and I love love the salad bar, it's the best one I've ever been to. It doesn't have absolutely everything you can imagine that might be on a bar, but everything they do have is very fresh, clean, and cold. 

I've never ordered anything else besides soup and salad from here and I don't think I ever will, because I love it that much."}
{"text":"Had the pastrami on rye.Very dry no taste. Also had the salad bar, nothing to write home about. The cost $16.19 so not worth it. I'm from L.A. so I know my deli's. This was terrible!"}
{"text":"Don't go to Jason's Deli unless you want the manager to express that the bug in your food is to be expected because their vegetables are organic therefore don't need to be washed. Fucking gross."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant for salads and sandwiches!! I love everything about this place. Tonight I was unsure if I was going to make it on time to order since they close at 9:00pm, but thankfully I arrived on time. I was greeted by a  friendly staff member who took my order and offered a complimentary water for the wait since I was ordering my order to go. While my daughter and I were waiting for our order, a staff member asked if we would like to take home strawberry shortcake. We couldn't say no, of course! Lol. It was a wonderful gesture by the staff to get free dessert. Once again, the service was great and the staff was very friendly. The salads,soup, and shortcake were all very delicious!! I really recommend this place as you can't go wrong with your order and the staff knows what customer service is."}
{"text":"This place is so overrated. The food is mediocre at best. The seating is horribly packed together and feels like a elementary school cafeteria. The layout of where you order is awkward and confusing. I got the spaghetti and meatballs and the garlic bread was stale and not hot with like a finger sized stripe of garlic butter on it. I would take subway over Jasons deli. It was such a disappointment since I heard it was so good."}
{"text":"Me and my daughter love this place,  when we lived in vegas we came here a lot... which is funny because when I was pregnant their spaghetti was the only thing I could hold down.
   We like to share our meals, she gets the salad bar and I get a chicken sandwich, I love that they offer three different amounts of meat you can have on your sandwich. Love the homemade chips and sometimes they give a pickle.
 The salad bar is simple,  not a lot to offer but what they have is fresh and delicious. The offer crackers and ice cream to anyone that orders an entrée."}
{"text":"I love there soups. They have a large variety. That have a good salad bar. We usually gae it to go. The portions are good and you can get fruit instead of chips. They make this fruit dip that is so delicious. It's clean and the staff is friendly. A lil slow but not to bad. Try the Papa Joe yum"}
{"text":"Love Jason's Deli. Had the salad bar today. Love the separate self serve register for salad bar. Lots to pick from. Love the potato salad"}
{"text":"The WORST delivery service ever!!! It was 1 hour and 50 mins before our order was delivered!! And YES it was cold!"}
{"text":"This JD always aces it in the efficiency department. It's because of that, this place is a workplace favorite among myself and coworkers. When dining out with a small - medium sized group, we try to find places that serve good food and allows us to get in and out within a reasonable amount of time. This Jason's Deli delivers on both.

The salad bar happens to be favorite with frequent diners but I prefer the sandwiches (Amy's Turkey O particularly) and soups (delish broccoli and cheese). If I'm not in the mood for a full sandwich, I'll opt for the half sandwich/soup/salad combo. They have a coca cola fountain machine that also has a dasani sparkling water option (double like). 

The piece-de-resistance is the ice cream machine. Chocolate, vanilla, and/or the swirl are available to be put in a cone or bowl. I'm a cone girl and love being able to end my lunches on a sweet, creamy note."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for our first time just the other day. First thing I saw was the salad bar and I fell in love. We each got a half sandwich and a trip to the salad bar. My California club was perfect with the flaky croissant and my husband had the brisket with cheese melted and onions and was so delicious. We just moved nearby and I think this will be a new favorite for us!!"}
{"text":"So your going to Scottsdale via Paradise Valley....or your coming from Scottsdale heading east....your stomach is growling but you don't want the usual...then look no further than Jason's Deli. I was in that situation on Friday night and decided to give this locale a try....and I must say I was not disappointed. I had the Smokey Jack Panini with Smoked turkey breast....guacamole....provolone cheese....lettuce...tomato....bacon on the side which I gave to my wife....LOL...since I don't eat red meat....and Russian dressing. However sandwich was made to order and pressed perfectly on the grill....and the flavor was outstanding. They give you a pickle and homemade potato chips on the side....and I also had some lemonade which comes from a fountain with free refills. 

I almost missed out on the free Ice Cream....but I seen people walking around with cones of Ice Cream and I had my wife ask was it free. Indeed it was and we both enjoyed a nice Ice Cream cone....mine was chocolate vanilla swirl...and you can also get it in a cup as well. The service was great and the whole place had a real nice neighborhood feel to it.....I look forward to returning here very soon. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"We both had the Reuben with pastrami only. I love how crunchy the sauerkraut was, and how tender and peppery the pastrami was,  and overall not too greasy. We split the strawberry shortcake. It was a bit dry, but I won't dock em for it, since this isn't a bakery."}
{"text":"Not sure this place merits the name \"deli.\" It feels more like a chain sandwich joint. The bread was soft and squishy, and the sandwich meat pretty flavorless. (Felt like the turkey it came from had been pumped with water.) The wait was fairly long because they're busy doing enormous catering orders. I'd say \"go somewhere else\" but it's located on a strip of many other crappy restaurants."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite while my car was being worked on at a local dealership. Pleasantly surprised at the quality and portion size of my lunch. Service was great and the price was right. I will be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and the people working were friendly.  But, the food was just okay the corn beef was sliced too thick and it was tough."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and was disappointed each time unfortunately. My first experience was not great because the staff got my order wrong two times. I went back to the counter to address that it was right on the receipt but the wrong order. The staff seemed upset that I couldn't just deal with what I got. The second time they got it right and it was an ok meal. My last experience with them I again was given the wrong order again and the staff argued with me about how I had ordered the wrong item. So in the end the meals were ok but I will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My favorite deli! Can't stop going back! It's really good and there is lots to choose from! Free soft serve, and muffins with a meal! I always get the turkey wrap!"}
{"text":"Great food! I got a sandwich and gumbo. I would have give 5 stars but the rice was kind of hard but great selection and customer service!"}
{"text":"Salad bar A1
Healthy portions
Plenty of good menu choices
Very clean
Friendly service
They have take out too!
Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Okay so I'm not normally the type of person to leave reviews, especially bad ones because I work in the food industry but I cannot let this experience go. This was my second trip and it will definitely be my last! Never again. The first time I came I was with my mom and it was awesome. We talked for months about returning. Well we finally did tonight and I wish we hadn't. We walked in to a completely empty restaurant. Literally the only ones in the building. We ordered our food, two meals which included the salad bar. After the order we were handed a number but no plates for our salad bar. It had been a while since we had been here so I thought maybe it would come with the sandwiches...which doesn't really make sense but that's besides the point. I decided to go ask the people working on our food at the counter if we could get our salad plates early and start on that while we waited for the rest of our food. Not a big deal right? Wrong. I stood there in front of FIVE employees while every single one did everything in there power to not make eye contact with me. Really? I stood there for a solid 2-3 minutes before returning to my table completely irritated. A few minutes later I decide to go back and just ask instead of wait for someone to acknowledge me. I asked a gentleman \"working\" behind the counter about plates and I got a blank stare and an \"I don't know\" luckily a girl behind him heard me and pointed him in the right direction. Finally! Until he handed me an extremely gross and obviously dirty bowl and acted irritated when I asked for a clean one. All I have to say is, no wonder the restaurant was empty. Lesson learned. Your food is only as good as your customer service."}
{"text":"My experience here was meh at best haha. Would've given two stars but there was free ice cream so I had to add one on. I went here for a Junior Achievement fundraiser, and was excited to try it out because there were a few tasty sounding vegetarian sandwiches and soups. However, I wasn't all that impressed. 
There were some positives. As I mentioned before: free ice cream. A downside is the ice cream kind of sucks though haha. Also it was clean, people working there did a good job of getting us our food in a timely matter!
I ordered half a veggie wrap with a cup of tomato basil soup. If it weren't for the fact that a percentage of the money was going to charity, I would say it was kind of a waste of money. I could have made a significantly better wrap at home for cheaper. The soup was too chunky. It was just ok. Portions were tiny. The fruit they gave me was really good though, nice and fresh!
I don't think I'll be back to Jason's Deli unless someone really wanted me to go ha. But it was just mediocre for me!"}
{"text":"There's two kinds of workday restaurant lunches in my life. The first kind occurs about once a week, when everyone on the team goes, and we spend some time socializing in a real restaurant. The other kind also occurs about once a week and involves my walking out the door without my (fully packed, waiting in the fridge) lunch bag.  Jason's is a good spot for the latter type of lunch, but not the former.  The food is good and, depending on what you get, even fairly healthy.  I tend to stick to the \"lighter choice\" sandwiches, which include things like chicken salad and the Mediterranean wrap.  The salad bar is extensive and fresh.

The reason Jason's is not good for the more social kind of work lunch is that it's big, crowded, pretty atmosphere-less, and loud. Service is quick, but if you go at noon, be prepared to have many co-diners."}
{"text":"It's was ok ! My sandwich was decent but very small and pricey and they upgraded me for fruit instead of chips. The salad bar was picked over and didn't look fresh. I won't go back !"}
{"text":"This place was so pleasantly surprisingly delicious! The staff was so nice and friendly and made sure we were taken care of the entire time we were here. A great menu with tons of yummy options! AND FREE ICE CREAM"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch to meet a colleague.  It was noon and the place was super busy.  Although it was really busy I was able to go through the line quickly and have my lunch in front of me within 5 minutes.  Prices are average for a deli and the food quality is great!  If you are in a pinch for time this is a reliable stop for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. So many good options on the menu and the kid's menu is one of the best around. Salad bar is amazing and staff and service is always great. We like the patio outside and free ice cream :)"}
{"text":"THEY DELIVER!!
I can't tell you how much i love this quality.  Lets face it, there are days when you don't wanna get your lazy but up to get something to eat when you are out of groceries or sometimes you are so swamped with homework that you can't afford to take a break to step out for something- these guys are prompt.  You can order online and they never take too long.  I love getting their sandwiches or soups and they have an awesome selection of baked potatoes.  It's not too pricey either which is fantastic.  Every time I order from them my food is still hot and always delicious.  Thumbs Up!"}
{"text":"Perfect little lunch spot. Had the manager special aju dip was fantastic. I got the salad bar and everything was fresh and yummy. Great healthy lunch spot. I will definitely come back. I might even start having business meetings here. The noise is not too loud and the staff is very customer centric focused. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite salad places. Everytime I go the customer service is on point. The staff at this location is amazing. I always get the half sandwich and the salad bar. To my suprise the salad bar is always nearly kept and packed with fresh ingredients. I eat hear about 1 timer per week. The peaceful atmosphere is relaxing and easy to enjoy. Keep up the great work Jason's deli!"}
{"text":"Fantastic choice! My first time eating here was great.
 I ordered the salad bar and I didn't have to wait in line because salad bar orders are paid for with a machine in the front. 
 It was the best salad bar i have ever eaten! The dark muffins were outstanding with a touch of ginger. I loved the potato salad and the veggies were prepared better then i have ever seen.
The broccoli was cut to reduce the stems and the cucumber slices were extra thin. Attention to detail was impressive.
 The Asian salad was tasty. This whole place is tasty. Great hummus too.
 My only issue (minor) is that the Jason crackers were very hard to bite. I don't know if it is because they are extra thick, the ingredients or age. 
 Overall I love this place."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Tried it for the first time, I went in and told the lady that I'd never been there before and she explained all the menu options and even recommended a few things. I LOVED their selection I appreciated her friendliness. Everything looked great, everything I had that day tasted great! Definitely a place I'll frequent!"}
{"text":"I enjoy eating at this Jason's Deli. The staff is friendly and very attentive. Also, the restaurant is spacious, and there's plenty of seats always available. 

I usually come for their salad bar; it gives Sweet Tomatoes a run for their money. There are plenty of options to choose from, and everything is super fresh. My favorite item, which totally defeats the purpose of eating healthy, is the chocolate mouse-pudding. It's available only at the salad bar. Trust me, the smoothness of the mouse, mixed with whole chocolate chips is to die for! 

Here's a tip: if you plan on returning frequently, I'd invest in one of their Jason's Deli thermos cups which sale for $3.99. Bring it back on returning visits to pay only $.99 for refills:-)"}
{"text":"Had Jason's catered into a class we were in for two days this week and their food was so good!
So we decided to come to Jason's for breakfast / lunch with our kids and its even better in person! Manager greeted us at the door went over menu options. Great prices and portions. I ordered a Ruben 1/2 portion and it came with an option of side salad or soup, I got the salad and I was able to build it myself at the salad bar, which by the way has a wide array of options you don't see at salad bars anymore. Fresh produce! To top it off, you get free ice cream sundaes build your own!!!! Can't wait to come back, the kids loved it."}
{"text":"This is a great little cafe-like place to eat. I've tried just about everything on the menu and never had any complaints. Their new items (like the Banh Mi and quinoa shrimp salad) seem a little far fetched to what they usually serve but hey, if it's good what does it matter right? 

I've had many lunches with long distance friends, spending hours refilling our soda/tea and cooling down with the free ice cream. It's a very relaxing spot. 

Get the California Club or Plain Jane potato!"}
{"text":"One of my usual hangouts for lunch.  I'm rarely disappointed.  The quality of the sandwiches is high, the salad bar is pretty solid, and and the service is always friendly.  My favorite is the Roast Beef, which comes with chips."}
{"text":"Love this place! I recommend the Smokey jack panini and the chicken noodle soup ( especially the soup when you're sick) this is my favorite chicken noodle soup ever. Idk why but it's the absolute best.
I ordered for pickup today my usual order. Sandwich was crammed in a tiny to go container ( why? Lol) but everything was delicious.
I would like to suggest Jason's deli maybe get some flavored chips to have as a side option. 

I LOVE this place and the soup alone is worth going! 
Try it especially if you're not feeling well the chicken noodle soup is the best!"}
{"text":"First of all,
I come to Jason's often, I bring my family and recommend friends. 
However, today around 5pm, it was dead. My mom and I were the only ones in the restaurant. Yet, when I ordered my sandwich and we paid, the employee with blond hair was starting it, then a guy came in (maybe boyfriend or brother?) and started talking while I was watching her not make my sandwich that I paid for. 
It's not hard to have excellent customer service, especially when it's dead. 
I'm an assistant manager in retail and I've had food service experience. I recommend Wildflower Bakery or Paradise for the price & the great customer service you always receive there. 
Although, an older man was kind enough to clean off a table for us because- although it was slow, the tables were disgusting with crumbs. Maybe clean up your tables and give better customer service."}
{"text":"Just some regular white people cuisine.  Nothing you can't make at home.  Shows how lazy those people are."}
{"text":"JD has ready good portions and food. The staff at this location is very friendly and the offer validation for the super expensive Molasky parking garage. They can be a little pricey for some items but over all a good spot. 

I also wrote a tip with my favorite menu items listed. (But there are a lot of other great things on the menu.)

Btw its a cafeteria style place but they have runners ro bring ur food if you are dining there. Free ice cream and mini corn muffins (which are great too). Also they are super busy between 11:30am until about 1:00pm."}
{"text":"Rude and messed up the order. I placed an online order for 5 sandwich boxes for my team as a \"thank you\" for working on Saturday. The pickup time was 1-1:30 so I went around 1:25 to give them time. When I walked in there was a very long line and I simply asked the cashier, \"Is this where I pickup online orders?\" She rudely said, \"There is a line\" and gestured to the line. I clarified, \"I already paid for the order, I just need to pick it up.\" At that time a guy behind her said brashly, \"We have other customers, we'll have it ready in a minute.\" It's not intuitive where pre-paid order should be picked up and they were not helpful in directing me. Upon receiving the sandwich boxes and giving them to the team, there were no condiments or silverware included. The boxes were all mislabeled so we had to shuffle to figure out what sandwiches belonged with what dessert and who ordered what. My intention was to do something thoughtful and treat my team to lunch for their hard work but unfortunately that was ruined by a poor customer experience."}
{"text":"Someday, I'll try the other foods from the Jason's Deli menu, but usually the AYCE salad bar is what I get. Healthy and filling, the mixed greens never appear wilted and there's a variety of veggie toppings. I like how the salad bar isn't limited to just veggies and the standard salad dressings; pasta salads, couscous, and hummus are also offered.

There are a few sweet items to finish (maybe even start) off your meal, like chocolate pudding and mini gingerbread muffins. The mini gingerbread muffin was my favorite with its crunchy exterior and soft and moist inside. The pudding was OK, and the only special trait about it were the chocolate chips, but I prefer having a small cone of chocolate or vanilla yogurt from the soft-serve machine. 

Because this Jason's Deli is located in a multi-level office building, it receives plenty of customers during lunchtime. The long lines only look intimidating, but service is efficient, so you never have to wait too long."}
{"text":"I tried a salad & a turkey panini. The Turkey panini was good but way too salty, the salad on the other hand was delicious. They had a lot of options so that was definitely a plus. Customer service sucked though, you can really tell the employees don't enjoy working there and are just ready to go home."}
{"text":"First time here and I really enjoyed it! The food was not only affordable but also delicious and filling with a decent portion size. The service was great and the space was quiet and had plenty of space to sit. And of course, the free ice cream was just awesome!"}
{"text":"I attended a lunch event today that was catered by Jason's Deli. I was pleasantly surprised that they had a gluten-free lunch box for me. It had a turkey sandwich on gluten-free bread  and the bread was good! The chips and pickle were of course gluten free too. I'm pretty sure the craisin-oatmeal cookie was not gluten-free but it was good. (I'm sensitive to gluten but I don't have Celiac, and the lunch came with a warning that the deli's kitchen is not gluten-free and cross contamination is likely.)"}
{"text":"The boyfriend wanted subway but I want to try something different....so Jasons Deli it was. Everything was really good. It's got that homemade sandwich but better feel to it. Loved it.... But it's kinda pricey for the \"homemade\" sandwich.. The price is the only reason I gave it 3 stars."}
{"text":"I have ALWAYS love this place and haven't ordered from there in forever. So a coworker decided to order and we all jumped in. I received my lunch but sadly for got my ranch dressing. I called and spoke with a nice guy on the phone and put the mgr that was super sweet on the phone and because they forgot my ranch she was going to have someone bring it right over and offered me a cookie or a drink since they forgot my ranch. I said no thank you but she still sent it and the driver was super sweet with a friendly smile and made sure I was fine. You guys made my day and remember why I love this place and the staff. My only down fall was not taking names. So I hope with the time I called in my order in you can thank them all for me."}
{"text":"Place was very busy. Short wait to order a Rachel. Great sandwich. Sat and watched kitchen area at work. They were very coordinated with a catering order and preparing eat in customers food. Only draw back no location near Queen Creek. Due to distance not able to eat here as often as I would like. Thanks for the birthday discount. Awesome place to eat!!! Quality food w/o HFCS and other junk i refuse to eat."}
{"text":"Walked into Jason's with my kids and shocked at filthy dining area.  We ordered our food, got our drinks and were not able to sit at a table because all 18 tables that were not occupied had dirty dishes on them.  Finally to ask mgr if someone could clean one off so we can sit down.  If the dining area is this messy, I can only imagine how filthy the kitchen is.  Ordered chicken Caesar which came out with no dressing, California club croissant roll tasted like it was week old. I think u get the point."}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches here at Jason's Deli. Great service, cool atmosphere, helpful and nice employees.  I really enjoy the croissant club . It is my favorite sub. it has guacamole on it. that rocks. also great tomato soup. It's the best."}
{"text":"This is an awesome workday lunch spot! The sandwiches and salads are delicious, the staff is nice, and I am in an out within the hour! Perfect!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with the family to have dinner and it was my first time at this location. I had eaten at the Jason's Deli near Arrowhead Mall may times before. This location was definitely less busy, which can most likely be due to it's location at Metro Center Mall.

The set up was the same as all Jason's Deli locations. The staff was friendly and was ready to take my order right away. I ordered the deli club, which like other Jason's locations was a bit over priced at $8.

After I ordered I attempted to find a place to sit down and I was a little off put by the number of tables that hadn't been cleaned and whipped down. Then when I did find a seat it was in an area where the sun shinned through the window right on me. There were window shades but they did little to help.

When my food came to the table it was right in par with the food I've had at other Jason's Deli locations. The food was good and the free ice cream was nice.

In all the food was good, but a little over priced. The dinning area was unpleasant and dirty. I will be back to Jason's Deli but not at this location. I'll stick to one at Arrowhead Mall."}
{"text":"I ordered a half a grilled cheese sandwich. I was charged $7.29 and then told it would be another .69 cents for cheese. HUH? So you are telling me the one slice of bread costs $7.29 and then if I want cheese on my grilled cheese it will cost me .69 cents? When I inquired to the cashiers that couldn't be correct they argued right back at me. Seriously? You girls (cashiers) think that is conducting an honest practice? Charging someone 8 bucks for a half of a grilled cheese sandwich? Very shameful! Anyway, I went ahead and paid for it, thinking I was going to get thick bread with cheese oozing out the sides. When it was served there was nothing special about it. It was a slice of Wonder bread with barely any cheese in the middle. Can you say, now I felt disappointed, disgusted, and cheated!?! A manager was called over. I explained how I felt. She agreed. She said that upper management does not give them the tools they need on their registers to properly charge for a half grilled cheese. She refunded my money and I gave back the sandwich. Won't be going back. BTW, I think the girls at the register need to be coached about improvising and problem solving. (I posted a pic of the sandwich on here)"}
{"text":"Worth every $1 for lunch. When my co-workers and I sit around not being able to decide on what to get for lunch... Jason's Deli is the \"default\" option. Everyone can usually find something on their vast menu. Food is prepared fast, ingredients are pretty fresh, portions are good, and pricing points are reasonable.

Certainly, the massive line and turnover during lunch on a work-day is a testament to the well run business.

Not much more to say other than Jason's will get business at least 5 out of 20 lunches in a month."}
{"text":"The food here is so good and fresh. Whether here or in Illinois, I can always trust Jason's Deli for a healthy meal that will leave me feeling full guilt free."}
{"text":"I come here on a regular basis for the soup and to grab an ice cream cone on the way out. I have had the chicken chili, the regular chili, tortilla soup and the french onion soup. All of them are delicious! Seriously. The chili (both of them) are outstanding, the tortilla soup has a nice kick to it, and the french onion soup.. oh la la. Quick, cheap, delicious. Done!"}
{"text":"This place lived up to its reviews. Salad  bar is badass. They have kalmata olives, nice crunchy pickle spears, Israeli couscous salad, garlic toast and awesome ranch! 

I tried the delicious California club sandwich. Yesssssss.

Manager John was very nice and helpful too.

A+ would taste again."}
{"text":"Had the special. Homemade roast beef sandwich with aioli sauce,red onion and horseradish. I asked for cup of au jus and dipped my sandwich. OMG fantastic. I also got free muffins corn bread and gingerbread yum from salad bar and soft serve ice cream with meal. Great food."}
{"text":"Good quick food most of the time but avoid this place on the weekends staff is slow and take forever to clean and get you your food"}
{"text":"This place has been neglected. My club sandwich came on stale bread and my wife's salad had dry over cooked chicken.
This used to be a great place for lunch, but it's dirty and tired looking. When was the last time those windows were washed? And I know your floor is pealing up next to the salad bar, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't sweep and mop the rest of it too. There were dustbunnies floating around the entryway halfwall and the dirt build up was noticeable. 
Sorry Jason's.... Thumbs down in my book. \"free\" ice cream wasn't enough to win me over."}
{"text":"Requested a 10:30 am delivery four days ahead of time for a large group.  Order showed up 30 mins late.  Best part is I spoke with them 20 min before the requested time and there was no heads up.  Great customer service. Thanks Jason's Deli.  If you are feeding a large group and it is time sensitive this is not the place to use."}
{"text":"I got to my hotel a little after 10pm and, not wanting to order pizza, I yelped for a nearby restaurant and Jason's Deli came up. Knowing how delicious their food is, I gave them a call and the manager Tim said they had closed at 10 but since I was close he told me he'd reopen for me. Not only did he not rush me, he made recommendations and even threw in a couple extras. It was a great way to start my trip so if you're in Pineville, NC, go to Jason's Deli and ask for Tim. Incredibly nice guy and what great service!"}
{"text":"I got the veggie wrap which should have been called mostly spinach wrap.  It had absolutely no mushroom or other veggies in it. It didn't taste bad just realistically was lettuce and tortilla. It's always so crazy to me how veggie anything cost so much more than meat. I spent 9.45 for the wrap and a drink which wasn't worth it. When the girl came to serve me, she rudely and sarcastically mentioned that I need to put my number on the table ring. IVE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE! AND IM THE ONLY NEW CUSTOMER THATS WALKED THROUGH THE DOOR IN 10 MINS! I don't think I'll be coming back"}
{"text":"I just love their nutty all mixed up salad.  Every time my boss is in town, he insists that we have lunch here.  It took me about 3 or 4 visits to find what I like..  I think I had a turkey wrap once, and a couple of other dishes (sorry I don't quite remember what..) but this is, in my opinoin, by far, their best dish that i have tried!  They have some great healthy options but it also will not take much to make a 1000+ calorie meal out of their dishes.  Give it a shot if you are looking for a healthy option."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Up until last week I always thought this chain was like a Subway or Jersey Mike's clone. Turns out they've got a more extensive menu of hot and cold sandwiches, pasta, soups, salads, and a salad bar. The sandwich I tried -- the Poppa Joe -- was pretty good.Turkey, asiago, tomatoes, and a basil pesto on focaccia. Portion sizes aren't as crazy as Capriotti's or other places like that. They're more like healthy, normal sized meals. Soft serve ice cream is also complimentary."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli is just delicious!

You can even order online and pick it up if you don't want to eat inside. When you order online you earn \"deli dollars\". Currently this reward program is for online ordering only. Once you have accumulated at least 25 points, you can start to apply what deli cash you have t your total. Very cool!

I love the \"California Croissant\" it is just tasty. The baked potatoes are huge and too yummy! I decided I am going to start ordering the smaller baked potatoes because I just can't make room in my tummy for the big ones. This last visit I couldn't even eat half of it since it was so big!

If you eat inside you can help yourself to a free mini ice cream cone! Refills on drinks are free when dining inside too. They also have a salad bar.

The inside is clean and the employees are very helpful. They offer catering services and have boxed lunches."}
{"text":"Horrible! Hours on the door say 10am-10pm. So why are you closing down at 8:48? Ordered sandwiches and soup combos all 4 soups were cold they were out of most of the soups we wanted. Our bread was burnt on our sandwiches. Lady shutting down salad bar was cleaning with a cleaning product with open food nearby. I will not return to this location so disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"First timer at Jason's Deli. I had no idea of what to expect. I was surprised by the size of the place when we first walked in. I noticed the salad bar and what appeared to be a cafeteria style line, but I was soon to discover it was anything but. 
The menu was laid out well and I decided on a \"ranchero chicken wrap\". When the nice order taker asked me if I wanted the standard chips and salsa or something else I was caught off guard. I found out there are many choices but I stuck with the standard. When I was getting my drink I saw a tray of food being delivered I noticed it was a big ol French dip sandwich. I made a comment and the guy happened to be a manager. He said those are the small sizes. He offered to switch out my order but I said it will give me something to come back for. 
When our food arrived it was plated very nice. For just over $7 I was very pleased with the size of my lunch. When I took my first bite the flavor was very good and the chicken was tender. Tons of flavor and a small bit of spice from the jalapeños. 
I was impressed and will be coming back for that French dip!"}
{"text":"Wow amazing. We got the amy's with gumbo and the papa joe's. So delicious. We will be back."}
{"text":"LEGIT Reuben: choice of pastrami or CB (I always get pastrami, so I like it when places give you the choice). And then everything else was correct: generous portion of meat & swiss cheese, sauerkraut, 1000 island, and the rye bread is real rye. I hate ordering \"reubens\" from sandwich places and getting it on some dark brown sweet bread that isn't rye, getting provolone or some other generic white cheese, and cole slaw instead of sauerkraut - NOT a reuben people! I worked at a Jewish deli (Max's) for 4+ years, and the Reuben at Jason's Deli was *almost* as good as ours. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"A small group of us had sandwiches from Jason's .   I was not impressed.   My bread was stale.   I had a small piece of tomato on only half on my sandwich.  The cookie was very, very hard."}
{"text":"Got a $5 off bday email..which was nice..salad bar could use some perking up.  Otherwise fine."}
{"text":"I have seen this place many times and heard it was good. I finally had an opportunity to stop by for takeout. We were working with the cabinet designer st Lowe's and it was taking longer than I expected  (not her fault) and I really needed something to eat before I crashed! Anyway, I wanted so thing fast and somewhat healthy. I thought Jasons Deli would just be sandwiches, but I was pleasantly surprised. They have a pretty extensive menu of salads, soups, sandwiches and a few entrees and specials. It is fast casusl, again a surprise. I ordered 3 sandwiches to go and they were made quickly. They were very fresh and tasty. You place your order and then you can sit down if you are eating in. They have a very large, healthy looking salad bar!! Each of us enjoyed our meals.  I had grilled chicken and it was tender, flavorful, not dried out, and a reasonable portion. The BEST part was they also list the calories for each menu item!! That got Jasons the fifth star! I will go back!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time but we decided to see if things had improved as they are nearby and we wanted a salad bar situation.   I have to say we were happy to find things are better..it was clean, service was good and friendly. Salad bar was well stocked w fresh items.  My only complaint was the ranch dressing.  It tasted artificial like bottled cheap stuff. I think on a salad bar, you need best dressings.  We love ranch and that's not good ranch plus there was no french dressing offered.  So for that reason we would not go back for the salad bar...it's a personal preference.  Too bad cause it could be great."}
{"text":"We come to jasons all the time, we love it! My favorite is the club sandwich with the chicken pot pie soup, so so good! I like that they put a lot of meat on their sandwiches so you don't feel like you're getting jipped (like subway). Everything always tastes fresh and your food gets done quick, which is surprising considering they are usually so busy. Yum!"}
{"text":"Mediterranean wrap is so good! Great service and fresh foods for a reasonable price. Yum!"}
{"text":"All you can eat salad.  But I like my own dressing....there ranch. Just isn't right."}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite spot when I am looking for a sandwich... I tried a chicken pesto panini and a coup of soup and it was really delicious!  They have a really great looking salad bar that I will try when I dine in (both times I've been, I've called for pick up).  The place looks clean and the staff is friendly, and they gave me a coupon for a free cookie if I took a quick online survey.  They have options for every type of diet and is really good about including nutrition information for their menu.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"my review is based on the food..
honestly, I have never stepped foot inside this place. We typically have our porters grab our orders for us and bring it back to our office.

These sandwiches are amazing.
The rueben is stupid good but the New York Yankee blows my mind.
3/4 pound of insanely good pastrami and corned beef on rye bread that is toasted perfectly.  Literally 3 inches of hot meat and I can't get it into my mouth fast enough.
ugh... I'm hungry for it now.

The soups are great too.. rich and flavorful and quite filling.

This deli is doing sandwiches right.  2 thumbs up!!"}

The convenience of over the phone/online orders is not great. Great for sit down though.
Placed a pick up order over the phone.
Do not go by the estimated time they give you on the phone, add about 15 minutes. Person on the phone said my order would be ready in 15 minutes. I told him I would show in 25 min. 
Showed exactly on the time that was specified, still had to wait an extra 20 minutes.

In all fairness they had an influx of online orders come in at the same time. 

However examining the assembly line, saw some idle hands. 
Management needs to consider changing their process to put cashiers (if more than one available) on the assembly line.
3 cashiers standing waiting for no walk ins.
2 people visibly working on making orders.

The food is always good here though!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in Jason's Deli , at the time l wasn't feeling well and just wanted something easy l order the chief salad and a cup of cheddar broccoli soup omg it was the best soup lv had in along time the salad was big and so delicious l had it for 2days and all the employees there were so nice and made me feel comfortable. This place is wonderful and l will be back soon Thank you for being so kind and the great food"}
{"text":"Always love the salad bar! They also have a great California club! Staff is pretty attentive."}
{"text":"Such a huge disappointment
 I ordered a Hot Pastrami sandwich and came out cold. I also ordered regular chips and got baked chips. I wrote to Jason's Deli corporate and was told I would receive a gift card. That was over a month ago. We are writing this place off and go to Chompies."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli is a place where you a great sandwich, soup, potato with a surprisingly good salad bar.  Their salad bar has never disappointed with a lot of items, many that you only see at an exceptional buffet.  Potato salad, corn salsa, banana pudding, spicy nut mix are a few of the unexpected tasty items.

So I always get the salad when I come, but today I usually get soup and today I got the chili. I accepted the offer to add onions.  The chili is chili con carne and was terrific.

I have never had a bad meal here. Today the free ice cream machine wasn't working unfortunately."}
{"text":"Great salad bar with the option to self pay. They probably lose money with hungry salad bar patrons and the quality of items they have available. Cajun mix, hummus, fruit salad are some of the notable items.

I always get the salad bar, but I also like getting the excellent southwest chicken chili. The club is great too!

Never had anything I didn't love here."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a business trip and the place was packed. The staff was SO FRIENDLY! They were so attentive and informative to their customers even when the place was full of customers! The man at the front was awesome and super nice, made great recommendations about what we should order and was super welcoming and friendly. The salad bar looked yummy and the free ice cream and muffins were great too. The food runners were really friendly and upbeat, I really enjoyed my experience here...not only the food but the interactions with the staff too."}
{"text":"I had ordered from this store and they never delivered my food.
I called them and they said they couldn't find my office, but they never called to say they couldn't find my office! 
Then they said they'd redeliver it and refund me the fee to deliver it,  but they never did even though they faxed me a new receipt to get the refund, which I signed and  I sent it back but never got my money, horrible customer service, the delivery was an hour and a half late! 
food was cold and gross, I'll never order from Jasons deli again for the price I'm being charged and the level of service."}
{"text":"Jason's offers a nice variety of healthy or not the healthiest of selections. Nothing like options. I jump around their menu and haven't had anything bad yet. My favorites are the Rueben, a few of the club sandwiches and of coarse the broccoli cheese soup. If you want a some soup and sandwich go with the Managers Special. Half a sandwich and a cup of soup, the best of both worlds. Don't forget the complimentary self serve ice cream."}
{"text":"David Reeder Manager at Woodlawn location Charlotte, NC. Extremely rude. You would think that they would treat you with great customer service, but he put a bad face on the company with his attitude. I'll definitely be choosing another lunch place to eat at from here on out. 
Customer service means everything and if a company doesn't have that they won't dare get any coins from me."}
{"text":"I've been to many Jason's and this one is pretty nice. Staff is friendly and quick service. I love the salad bar and cheesy broccoli soup! My husband gets the Beef Eater sandwich and he loves it! However, it's very chain like and I've had better and more interesting sandwiches. It might be a tad bit overpriced"}
{"text":"Ordered the meatball sandwich and it was delicious. The service here is always great and they take care of one hour of parking.  All around good experience."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about Jason's. We were in the mood for something different and on the lighter side. I had already checked out the menu online and decided I wanted a Muffaletta. I was a bit confused about the Special which includes a 1/4 Muff, ruffled Potato Chips and a pickle. The cashier said you could have a go through the Salad Bar as the side. The Salad Bar looked very fresh and that was what I went with. Let's just say I hardly ate a light meal. I made a huge salad and added some of their Potato Salad, Tuna Penne Pasta Salad and then got a desert plate and got some of their yummy Fruit Salad and some of the best muffins I have had in awhile. The Muffaletta was huge despite being only a quarter. The Salad was very fresh and the Fruit Salad was tasty as well. The place was pretty slow, but it was an hour before close on a Sunday night. The crowd was predominantly if not exclusively Gay on my visit. I am not sure if this is typical. I will certainly be back to a Jason's Deli soon. I wish they would put one in Central Phoenix soon."}
{"text":"Love this place! Me & my family of 4 can all eat for $20! That's cheaper than fast food!!! And they have pretty healthy food . Me & my boys also have celiac's disease & they are really good with not cross contaminating & have a couple things to choose from that are gluten free."}
{"text":"Met Rand H and Mike C and Jackie C here for lunch today.  For a chain they do a pretty good job of making sandwiches, salads and soups.  And in the American tradition almost anything you order is more than you really need.  But it is good and you keep eating! :)"}
{"text":"This is the third time I have had a sandwich from here but the first time I have been in the building.  The last two times I sent somebody else to pick up a sandwich for me.  One of those times I used the internet to order which went flawlessly.

This time, Friday lunch, I had a New York Yankee and a fountain drink ($9.95 with tax).  I took advantage of he excellent weather, 95° slight breeze, to sit outside at a table in the shade.  Their sandwiches are OK and plenty filling.  It comes on a plate with potato chips and a pickle spear.  This place is a chain and while it is consistent in quality and portion size something is lost in the translation flavor wise from a Jewish deli.  While they do better than most sandwich shops I prefer Miracle Mile locally or Greenberg's in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I agree with Jason L. about avoiding this place for date night. I tried to go have grown-people time with my man, and we were overwhelmed with kids running underfoot. It was hard to talk.

The food is good, if slightly pricey. The tomato basil soup is good, and I enjoyed the garden ciabatta. 

It's a decent place for lunch when you're in the middle of the work day. The service is pretty quick, and there's always the salad bar option if you're in a hurry. It's nicer than the other chain delis, so it's good to have on hand. I get into such ruts with lunch that I need help sometimes remembering that I can go to more than the three places I always go."}
{"text":"Lunch at Jason's Deli is always enjoyable for me for some reason or another. I really want to love this place, but I just can't...I'm stuck in 'like' mode. You get a LOT of food here which is a plus, the employees are super friendly, and the location is conveniently off the I-10. I got the french dip and salad bar and the food was delicious, see? All great reasons to love this place, but... 

The bathroom was...awful. It was dirty and stinky...VERY stinky. The dining space is really cramped. There is barely enough room to shimmy between the tables and chairs when there is no one sitting in them...so it complicates things when people start sitting down to eat. The layout from ordering, to paying, to receiving is weird, the salad bar area is cramped...I just feel so claustrophobic when I'm there, which doesn't make sense because this location is basically an open room with one low wall... 

The salad bar was well stocked, clean-ish, and of course the food was good - I will keep going and enjoying the food, but I will probably always feel uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I have not been to a Jason's Deli in a long time.  The Chandler location is the first time I have been there...   Still love it!  So many things to pick from.  We went there, because my sister wanted soup.  And plus we had the 4 and 2 year old...  They can not sit still in a sit down restaurant.  

I got the daily special soup:  Chicken Pot Pie.  It was so good.  The mini puff pastry was a nice touch.  Loved it!  Then I got the New York Yankee sandwich.  The sandwich was HUGE.  And it was GOOD!  It was good food and good company from my sisters and the kids."}
{"text":"Love their chicken pot pie soup.  I had to get a BOWL of it.  And then a po-boy pastrami melt.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Went to this Jason's Deli with my parents.  It is set up the same as off the other ones.  Good food, good service, and you can't forgo the soft serve ice cream....  

It was very nice of them to split a regular sized order of French beef for my parents.  I got the half soup/half sandwich.  My favorite:  chicken pot pie soup and corn beef sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is better than I remember!

OK, so I used to work right around the corner from this place back when this location first opened and I usually helped myself to their salad bar which was OK.

Tonight I got a call from a business partner who wanted to have a dinner meeting at Jason's Deli. I wasn't to exited, about both, the food and the meeting... BUT... I was wrong (at least about the food)! I had one of their Panini Sandwiches and it was great! To top it off, the staff was friendly, helpful and actually knew the menu, what else could you want....!

I can see myself swinging by here more often, even if its for boring business meetings... the food is well worth it!"}
{"text":"I used to work here. Let me tell everybody reading this. Don't ever ever go to this location. It's not clean. They use  rags to clean the bathroom then clean tables with the same rag. I remember a kid threw up and we had to mop it up, they then used the same mop to mop the floors during closing without disinfecting it. The soups aren't handmade they come frozen inside of bags! Same with the sauces. Brownies, cakes, etc are delivered. They leave the meat and ice cream out over night. Customers don't know this but there are a few mice here as well. My experience here sucked! I was happy to leave! I will never step foot inside this or any other Jason's deli ever again! Just think about this next time you come to this location. El arroyo crossings. If you value your health don't come here smh. Save yourself and your money and go to the chilis next door"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious, I just wish the ice cream machine worked more than 1 out of every 5 visits."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Jason's Deli this evening while our adult daughter attended an event nearby. Upon entering the restaurant, we reviewed a sign about their loaded baked potatoes that are stuffed with things like pot roast, chili, etc., We walked up to the counter to read a sign with their special for the day. My husband ordered it. It was the Boston Club. It came with chips on the side and he ordered a medium fountain drink. I ordered the salad bar and a medium fountain drink and decided to try the blueberry pomegranate. The drink was very tasty and I would recommend it to those that like this type of combination. My husband had Barq's Root beer. 
The restaurant is spacious with adequate lighting and plenty of seating. It is clean and their was a bus boy who kept the tables clean. They have two flat screen T.V.s on ESPN to watch if you are a sports fan. The restaurant is clean overall and the salad bar is well stocked. When I was getting my salad a young lady was putting clean spoons in the salads and condiments. She told me they rotate the spoons out every few hours. 
Everything was fresh. They use only the freshest ingredients at Jason's Deli. I went twice to the salad bar and each time I wasn't disappointed.
The employees are friendly and helpful. I love Jason's Deli and it has been a year since we were there. We will have to come back sooner this next time.
I unfortunately did not take any pictures of our food, as we were too busy enjoying our food we ordered its that good.
We will return in the near future."}
{"text":"Summer is over and the Pot roast sandwich is back!! This is my absolute favorite sandwich here. I'm not really big on the other sandwiches because they just don't measure up to a real east coast/ New York deli. They do have free mini corn breads and pickles and for desert soft serve ice cream. The positives I give this place are its always clean and the staff is always friendly and helpful. The bathrooms are clean too. My tips for other deli sandwiches are Pastrami at Capriottis, cheesesteak at Pops, and gyro at Yassou Greek. Haven't found a French Dip I would recommend yet in Vegas"}
{"text":"Frequent slow/inaccurate orders.  This is not one of the better valley locations.  Metro center is the one to beat.  On my two of my three visits here, its taken nearly 20 minutes to get my order.  One of those two visits they did it incorrectly, and I had to switch the order to go as they burned up my lunch hour with their mistake.  Another to go order the dressing with my salad was watered down and it was caesar.  It ran like it was vinagerette.  I've mentioned the services issues to their manager.  First time they only apologized, never gave me reason to come back.  After three tries with this location, I'll stick with Metro center."}
{"text":"I've eaten here numerous times for lunch.  The staff is very friendly and the place is clean.   What keeps me coming back?  The Chicago club and the Broccoli cheese soup.  This is some of the best broccoli cheese soup I've ever had.  I'll be keeping this place on my lunch destinations"}
{"text":"First thing you will notice here is that you are noticed!  Staff is very friendly, and attentive.   I think it took one second to be acknowledged the second, and I mean the second, I walked up to the counter.  

The second thing I want to point out,  is to take your time studying the menu . There is even a nice comfy chair near the counter to sit down on while you decide your order.  Do not skim over this menu since there is so much to consider.

Try to take the time to dine in.  Dining room is very relaxing,and the food should be savored not devoured. My muffelta sandwich was nicely prepared and delicious. 

There was plenty of staff on hand  who stayed busy keeping the area clean, and orderly.

Definitely a place to visit regularly."}
{"text":"Ehhhhhh.....just like the guy I met a few summers ago....I've had better. 

Prices are pretty steep even for a salad bar. They don't have golden croutons, what gives?!"}
{"text":"I've been to other locations a few times and enjoy the food.  I don't know what was going on here last night (4/17), but I would have sworn it was a restaurant that was on the verge of closing.  It wasn't outright horribly dirty, but it was on the verge of getting that way quickly.  The ice cream machine had one flavor down and the other was a wreck.  The tea was out.  When we informed staff, they didn't seem to really be too concerned.  Staff was not rude by any means, they were quite friendly, but just didn't seem too worried about cleaning up or restocking or really much of anything.  Other patrons had food delivered to table.  Mine sat at counter with no notification. I lucked in to noticing it was there when I went up to get something.  This was well before closing time.   So on the positive side - generally friendly customer service experience and the food was good.  On the down side, just not as clean as it could or should have been."}
{"text":"I got to give them mad props to their customer service. I came to grab a nice salad here during my lunch break, and since I only ordered a salad I was hoping it'll be really quick to make. Well, I started to get worried as 15 minutes past and my salad wasn't ready. I came by to inquire about it, and as I did inquire, my salad happened to be ready to be served to me.

I was pleased, and even thought I was just being paranoid because of time. Regardless, Gerald the Manager was kind enough to comp my salad and apologize. Becca also came by to let me know that my meal was comped and apologized for the wait.

I mean really, they didn't have to comp my meal nor did I expect them to, but they did anyway for the inconvenience and gave me their sincerest apologies. Two thumbs up (or..5 stars in this case) on your customer service though!"}
{"text":"I never order out, ordered lunch today with the co-workers. Food was disgusting, over priced, and came incorrect with no cheese, although I paid extra. The bread which I also paid extra for was hard and Stale . In addition, the food came late and the coke came in a can when asked for a fountain drink. Never eating there again! Do not eat there."}
{"text":"This place is a gem the food was delicious on a busy day my order was fast, they even have fee ice cream.Dont miss the place"}
{"text":"HUGE menu. Lots of sandwiches, salad, wrap, etc. options. Desserts. Variety of drinks. Spuds! Healthy or non-healthy, they've got 'em all! I absolutely love this place! You can go for weeks and try something different everyday. Also because you can create your own sandwich or wrap too. Their spuds are pretty big and tasty. I only wish they had more than 4 spud options. Double-thumbs up."}
{"text":"Well, this could have been a bad review...but ended up very good. I stopped in for lunch kind of busy but not bad. Ordered the Ranchero Wrap. Waited...and waited...and saw others who arrived AFTER me get their food. Went to counter to ask and the guy making the food didn't see my ticket so asked what I ordered. I told him and saw him start making it. Then I waited and waited and saw others get their food...AGAIN! Went to counter and same guy saw me and showed me the plate waiting for chips/salsa that other workers overlooked. He gave me my plate and could tell I was upset. A few mins later, the manager comes over and apologizes and gives me a gift card. She was not sure why my ticket disappeared but was sincere in her apology. I thanked the guy behind the counter for informing her I was upset and thanked the manager for \"making it right\". When my food finally arrived, it was very good!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely obsessed with this place. I eat here almost everyday. I love how they have a great selection of food for vegetarians. I always get the veggie spinach wrap. So good. I also like how they offer a fruit cup as a side instead of chips and its actual chopped up fruit not canned. The people that work there are super nice and always remember my order. 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"Perfect work lunch spot!  The salad bar is extensive and has something for everyone.  The employees change out the items very regularly so you will always have the freshest veggies and won't find items that have run-out.  The kiosks in the back are ideal for skipping the line in the front.  You can process your own lunch order (I use it when I am just getting the salad bar!)  My favorite sandwich here is the Amy's Turkey - O or the Big Joe - you really get your money's worth.  It is one of the few places uptown all of my co-workers and I can agree on for lunch.  YUM!!!"}
{"text":"My first time trying Jason's Deli, everyone kept telling me they couldn't believe I had never eaten here! I ordered the California Club, it was in a delicious croissant and it was amazing! My partner ordered he beefeater and it was massive!! Wow, it looked really good.....and it apparently was really good as he destroyed the entire thing! We also decided to try the Lobster Chowder since it sounded good and we had been talking about that same soup earlier this week after seeing it on tv! It was creamy and delicious and had plenty of lobster! The staff was very friendly and helpful as well! The only reason we couldnt give it 5 stars is because Jason's no longer carries Violet Crumble candy bars! Violet Crumbles are the best candy bar and they are impossible to find in the US! We used to go to Jason's just for the candy bar....guess not anymore!!! ****PLEASE bring back the Violet Crumble!!!**"}
{"text":"A buddy of mine were driving around when we happened to see Jason's deli. \"Hey, when is last time you ate at Jason's Deli?\" Neither of us could remember. But I do remember that the food was pretty good. Upon entering, we were the only two people on the entire deli. We got really lucky, or the food was not going to be good. I ordered a pastrami sandwich and my friend ordered a roast beef sandwich. Before long, the entire restaurant was filled and there was only about three empty seats. After about 15 minutes, people started receiving their food. I found that kind of odd, since we were the first ones in there and ordered a long time ago. I went to where that sandwich pick up area was, and they quickly apologized and said our food Would be right out. After another 5 minutes, we did receive our food. I asked them why it took so long and they just apologize and asked us if we wanted a free cookie. I said sure, I'll take two! About 30 seconds later, another gentleman came by and profusely apologize for the delay in food. By then, I had already eaten a quarter of my pastrami sandwich. It was incredibly delicious. After making some small talk, I found out this gentleman was actually the district manager. Long story short he made up for the delay in the sandwiches. Getting back to my pastrami sandwich, the meat was tender, not too fatty, and very well flavored. The sauerkraut and dressing was a great addition along with the bread. I would've preferred the bread to be a little bit more toasted, however that's my personal preference, overall it was fantastic. My friend had never had a pastrami sandwich before so I offered him a bite of mine. I thought to myself, \"who has never had a pastrami sandwich?\" Anyway, he found it delicious also. 

Overall I would come back. The food was excellent. I'm not sure why I haven't been back sooner."}
{"text":"Terrible!  I ordered a HUGE order an they forgot two things. That's ok i guess but when I called to inform them that my food is missing, the manager  Cheri argued with me as if I was lying!  She kept telling me she knows its in the bag and i need to checkthe bag  i was appauled  ive been the gm of prestigious restaurants an i grew up running my dads sandwich shops (he owns 12 so i would say i know what im talking about!)The right thing to do is to live by \"the customers always right\" in that industry. The best part is, I found out that it was her fault. Yes, she put it in A bag. But she never gave that bag to the driver. She should have comped the sale because our food was ordered as an office to eat together and guess who ate alone?! ME!!  I see why they are closing locations in other cities!!!!  I do want to say thatthe driver was AMAZING!!!!  Thanks to him I am happier.

I bumped it up a star only because someone named Allison called and she apologized for the mess up. Thata nice and all, but mess ups happen thy is not a problem. Happens everyday inthe food industry. The one star and bad review was given because of the manager Cheri arguing with me as if I was making up the fact that my lunch was notbi n the bag. No one called to apologize for one her arguing rather than apologizing and getting my lunch to me asap and to apologizing because she was wrong about it being in the bag because she left it on the delivery shelf!  So Allison, thanks for trying."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli is a solid lunch spot for soup, sandwiches, salad bars and their gargantuan baked potatoes (spuds). 

Ambiance: 
This spot is a casual cafeteria style deli where you order at the counter and eat with efficiency.
It can get really busy and loud with the lunch crowd. However, you can expect the line to move fast (which is great when you're rushed).
  
Food: 
I've only visited this spot for a quick lunch a handful of times. I usually get the salad bar with my coworkers. On occasion, I order my Spud Au Broc for a cheesy guilty pleasure.

Salad Bar: 
Their salad bar is freshly stocked with chopped veggies (carrots, cucumbers, olives, mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes, red peppers, green peppers, broccoli etc.), fruit salad, beets, crackers, croutons, shredded cheese, cottage cheese, peas, pickles, hard-boiled eggs, potato salad, watermelon, artichokes, pasta salad, chocolate mousse with chocolate chips, vanilla pudding, and mini corn muffins. You also are offered soft serve ice cream (included with the salad bar).  You order and then grab your plate/fork at the 2nd station before heading to your table of choice. 

Spud Au Broc: 
Their spud is huge! It's covered with broccoli cheese soup, melted cheddar cheese, steamed broccoli, bacon bits, and green onions. This is made behind the counter and a food runner will find your table and number and deliver it to you. 

Tip: They offer this spud in half size. 

Service: 
They have a fantastic team of employees at this location. They do their jobs very well. It is always clean and everyone seems to be focused on their task. All the cashiers and food runners that I've encountered have always been outgoing and make you feel welcome. There is one older gentleman that is always walking the floor at lunch time. He busses the tables and is an exceptional employee. He asks if he can bring you anything and always has a smile. It always makes my day.  He's amazing and has a stellar work ethic. I will update this review when I find out his name. Service here has always been a 5 star experience. 

Overall, this is a solid lunch spot that I will keep it on my rotation solid 3.5/4 stars in my book.

{"text":"After a long day out and about, we online ordered sandwiches, salads, wraps, and soup, each personalized for our crew. Food definitely hit the spot and service was friendly. They got all of our orders right and it was ready for pickup within 20 minutes.  Only bummer is no free ice cream unless you dine in!"}
{"text":"Best Tuna melt in town!!! Always taste how I imagine it should taste like even when I ordered it Togo. Stapely best location! 
2/17/17 - Messed up my order but owner Very Nice, much respect. He apologized and said next ones on him!! Always a pleasure!!!"}
{"text":"Very solid deli food and incredibly nice service to top it off?   Wow, I'm impressed!

My wife and I came here to grab a quick lunch.   She opted for the Reuben and I went with some Turkey Pepperjack Panini sandwich.   Now I'm always reluctant with Turkey because it tends to be dry, but I figured worst case scenario, I'll still have a tasty panini sandwich with tomato and avocado.   Well, I needn't have worried.   The turkey was juicy and fresh and there was plenty of it.   My wife scarfed down her Reuben and said it was incredibly good.

Best part?   You get complimentary ice cream at the end of the meal!   This place is awesome for a quick and tasty lunch!"}
{"text":"I just ate the saddest grill cheese I've ever come across. They put one slice of cheese on the bread and the cheese didn't go to the ends of the bread... Sorry to be harsh but I am disappointed. The last time I was here food was great but this time it seemed like they slapped it on there. The cooks need to put more passion into making their food. :/"}
{"text":"Wow! This place was awesome! I have a manager special which was a half a sandwich and a soup. Had the corn beef sandwich on rye! Yum!! Did someone say free ice cream? My kids love this the best!"}
{"text":"Mediterranean Wrap (9 points) and Broccoli Cheese Soup (6 points).  Great lunch spot with friendly and attentive staff and the place is always spotless."}
{"text":"We had the California club and tuna melt were great. The service was fast and friendly. Will come back again."}
{"text":"The roast beef sandwich with guacamole on onion bun was delicious. The  chicken  noodle soup was great. The service was fast and friendly. Will come back again if in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is my family's favorite place to eat. The Salad bar is excellent and organic and their sandwiches are amazing.  My favorite sandwich is the muffaletta. It's a friendly atmosphere and everything is clean and orderly. For such quality food the price is very reasonable and to top it of they offer free ice cream for all."}
{"text":"I love their sandwiches but ordered a fruit plate and a salad today.  I was under the assumption that if sulfites are in food (which is against the law in many states) they should let you know...well I ordered delivery and dug into a fruit plate and a salad and within 20 minutes I had bumps all over my mouth, my lips, tounge and throat hurt.  If I order again, I will stick to sandwiches and soup.  But right now I am ready to jump on my NO ADDITIVES bandwagon!"}
{"text":"Food good. Service mediocre at best... 10 workers three customers and no greeting at all... Made me feel like I was bothering him..."}
{"text":"A HUGE disappointment with this location.  I used to love going here and we would go almost once a week for dinner.  The place now is just extremely nauseating.  Just looking around, especially when the sun shines in, would make you lose your appetite.  The chairs were nasty, the floors were gross and the windows, ole good lort, have they EVER been cleaned??  The woman's restroom is disgusting and the last time I went in there, there were 2 bugs chilling on the floor, alive, just waiting to gross someone out while they went to the bathroom.  Usually the food I order is pretty consistent but it should be since I never ordered anything difficult to make.  My boyfriend's food on the other hand was awful.  Oh the bum... the bum that gets to veg out and chill while people are EATING!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!  A disgusting, dirty, vile bum, who I shall call Large Marge, comes in there to hang out and get out of the heat .  She gets to chill there because she buys a cheap bag of chips, so clearly she is worthy to stay in an establishment where people eat.  I'm sure she hasn't bathed in like 15 years.  Gross for business?....nah, not at all!!!! Ugh!  The last time my boyfriend and I went in there, we have had enough.  \"Large Marge\" was walking around with her bare a$$ literally hanging out because the \"pants\" were 10 sizes to big for the woman who is already large.  \"Large Marge\" bent over several times and and we saw EVERYTHING and that was IT!  We had enough!  My boyfriend spoke to one of the young kids that worked there and he could care less with what had just happened.  Typical for that age generation, doesn't give a flying BEEP!  Needless to say, we will never go back and I'm pretty sure by reading this, you have multiple reasons on why that is."}
{"text":"Half and half. Half sandwich plus a trip to the salad bar. That's the ticket baby! I always come for lunch. This place can get busy around noon on a weekday. Can't go wrong with the food value here either. Sometimes the service is a little shaky, i.e., you ask for no mayo, you get mayo, you ask for a side of chips, you get fruit, those kinds of things. Otherwise, it's usually a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"Ever since I moved to Henderson four years ago, I've always loved Jason's Deli. Not once have I been disappointed with the service or the food quality. Their sandwiches are amazingly tasty and they have an excellent salad bar. They have Coke products. Their prices are extremely competitive for lunch/dinner options and they even have a soft-serve ice-cream machine for everyone to enjoy once they're done eating!
Customer service has always been excellent and never wanting.
I will definitely be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Good food at reasonable prices for the area.   Good variety of flavorful soups.  Classic deli sandwiches are what you would expect from a quality deli.  

My only reservation is the prominently displayed no gun sign.  Personally, I'm uncomfortable being in a business that handles a lot of cash but prohibits lawful customers from protecting themselves and their loved ones.  I'll respect the managements wishes and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Yummm Asiago pot roast sammich was yummy...  teas choices are great the club royal not melted cheese and no tomatoes... soo good..
Then icecream tooo yesss please."}
{"text":"As the name implies, this is the destination for deli, sandwitches and wraps. I tried Chicken Santa Fe and Chicken panini and both were delicious. They providesome free sides like crackers, muffins, and ice-cream. Staff are friendly, the place is clean and service is fast. 

Tip: Try black currant iced tea. It's very refreshing and smooth."}
{"text":"I'm honestly disappointed in this place. The portions were so small for what we paid. Yes, they have free ice cream, but that means that the price of the food is inflated to compensate for the free ice cream. There was nothing very wrong with the food itself, it was just very bland and simple. I wish I could say that I would return, but there are just so many other places where I would rather go."}
{"text":"They took away the military discount for some reason the last time I was there the soup was so so but it was very clean"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Jason's Deli.  They always get the orders right, always write the names of the order on the food, and the gluten free bread is cheap!  The only thing I ever get is the salad bar and I always get it to go.  My salad box is packed to the max, lettuce, fruit, veggies, hummus, beets, they have it all!  The staff is super awesome.  If they are running behind on an order they always through something in to compensate for the wait.  They gave me almost a loaf of bread for free, super nice considering that a loaf of gluten free bread is over $6 at the grocery store."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE sandwich fan so when my mom told me about them I was all in. I'm proud to say Subway has lost me forever!!! Jason's Deli is right up there with Jersey Mikes, only cleaner!!!!! This will now be my go to spot. The portions are adult sized!  Its a little pricey but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Jasons Deli is delicious! The sandwiches are fantastic as is the soup and the service was excellent! Very fast! Definitely would go to again!"}
{"text":"I was jonesing a sandwich today for lunch, so I tried to go to a near Swenson and Twain, but it was closed.  So I opted for a known commodity, Jason's Deli.

I ordered the New York Yankee, which is my favorite sandwich they have.  The place was moderately busy for the noon rush hour, but my food came out relatively quickly.

Will I come back?  Of course, it's one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Was going to eat here today thought after they were closed down by the health department for low score that they would have got the place cleaned up but today score was B..88..so we didn't eat there..they still must be having issues..i will not be back"}
{"text":"Time for Jason's to move toward NON-GMO's. The organic blue corn chips is a good start. Come on...do it!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in the heat of summer. The salad bar is great, all the vegetables are organic and while I've seen bigger salad bars, there is enough variety to keep it interesting. A trip to the salad bar will get you good red pepper humus (though that can sometimes separate a bit on really hot days), crackers and muffins as well. There are entrees for everyone. I love the baked potatoes (they're huge) and there are sandwiches, soups, wraps, and a variety of seasonal dishes. The staff is friendly, the food is great and every purchase gets you free soft serve icecream (not going to lie, sometimes I eat that while waiting for my food). Wait times are usually short, and they even deliver!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is amazing. Nice meaty sandwiches. I can't even finish a whole one by myself. And then, they offer free ice cream, free ice cream! Everybody, because everybody deserves ice cream. This was my first visit here, and I will absolutely come back 100%. I highly suggest this restaurant,"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices and clean with lots of seating!    I have to say this easily will be my local deli unless they give me a reason to switch!   The salad bar is awesome and I did a salad bar and half sandwich combo (yankee).  I also like the free soft serve!   
Lots of options and I'm looking forward to exploring the menu more."}
{"text":"WOOOOHOOOOOO JASON'S DELI!! Not only is this my go to restaurant for top notch deli food and jaw dropping soft serve, but its a place where i really feel like i can be myself. I walked in wearing nike shorts and horrific American Flag Chuck Taylors and only got judged twice!!! My first experience at jason's deli was a few weeks ago with my good buddy carson. I walked in, and despite the line going all the way to birkdale village, I got right in and ordered the best spud i has ever laid my eyes on. Loaded with deliciously fattening toppings, I ate that potato like it was the last potato in the galaxy. My drink of choice that evening was sweet tea..of course..followed by 11 cups of gourmet Swirl ice cream. so Id say it was a successful Girls night out. My employee that evening was a brunette southern belle named Lacey. I couldn't quite decide which toppings would tickle my fancy so she walked me through every single one without getting upset with me 1 time. I guess you could say i am now a regular:) Roll Tide my friends."}
{"text":"REALLY EXTREMELY disappointed with their service. UNLV spends hundreds on sandwiches from this store every month even multiple times a month. Jason's deli is a prime example of a business that has no regard for their customers and only on their profits. Our establishment has an agreement with Jason's deli's regional manager and still the DM and Supervisor were beyond uncooperative. Never will our college spend any money to order any lunch or catering from this restaurant and I will make sure ALL my colleges refrain as well. This store would serve well to take a how to give respect, while practicing professionalism training course -supervisor and manager especially."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I'm a fan of deli's and Jason's hits the spot. I always get the salad bar which is always well stocked. The free ice cream is always a winner for kids"}
{"text":"It was a dressed up cafeteria food! I had the beef eater and basically it was grey dry, package roast beef like you would get at a school cafeteria. My wife had to return her food and get a refund it tasted so bad. They give you ruffles for a side dish. Never eating there again."}
{"text":"Very good. I got the bird to the wise delish. Salad was great had a lot to choose from and you get free ice cream doesn't get better than that."}
{"text":"It seems we never have to wait even though we usually go during lunch time.  Their salad bar is awesome and if you don't get the salad bar, you can get as many little mini muffins and corn bread you want.  Also, how can you go wrong with some soft serve ice cream for dessert?  I have recently had to start sneaking the dessert since I am supposed to be on a better eating plan!  It's worth the scolding when the wife finds out!"}
{"text":"Jason's Deli is just a good go-to place for a fresh meal. I love their sandwiches and their fixin's and of course, the FREE softserve ice cream. Ya can't go wrong with that.

I really enjoy the salmon sandwich. So tasty. Today, though, I had the pastrami. Also tasty. Whatever Jason's I go to here in Phoenix or in Tucson, they are consistently good. Good food and good service and clean restaurants."}
{"text":"Disappointed!  This place is a half step up from a Subway.  I'm sure it's ok for those who have not had the experience of a true New York Deli.  The confusion of where to place an order was the first thing I noticed, as well as the next three unlucky customer's.  A deli that does not serve fries; what's up with that? Sorry Jason's Deli, you flunked the test."}

Sorry Jason's Deli, you flunked the test."}
{"text":"The food is always consistent and good at any Jason's but my five star rating is due to the service and kindness showed by Rod, the bus person. He came to check our table to make sure we were doing well and to see if we needed anything. He was so kind to my young son and young daughter. He has a very good heart and is a great asset to this Jason's deli. I will be back specifically to say hello to Rod even if I'm not eating. It makes me feel good to know that there are good people out in the world still."}
{"text":"Since Jason's Deli has closed in Arrowhead, Much to our disappointment, we had to drive across town as I was craving a muffuletta and Jason's is the only place I know that serves them jut like New Orleans.  We were not disappointed, I ordered a whole one knowing it would be way to much to eat but with plenty of left overs which we love.  Hubby had salad bar, fresh as it could possibly be and variety was abundant.  He was very happy and satisfied with food service and cleanliness.  Just wish it was closer. Please move back to our area!  Lake pleasant is growing keeps and bounds, good place for another deli."}
{"text":"WORST service ever and worst management! They charged me incorrectly then went on to forget BOTH of the desserts we ordered to go. They hd no drivers to deliver what they messed up on. RUDE! Lost 2 regulars for LIFE!"}
{"text":"Ordered carryout today. Plain Jane & pastrami sandwich. Staff was friendly & fast, restuarant was clean and relaxing.
Food portions and taste were standard to Jasons Deli. I like  them because they are pretty much the same across US. We enjoyed and we will be back"}
{"text":"Okay after reading all the fantastic reviews I feel I must have had a bad experience, or maybe the \"normal sandwiches\" are waaaaay better than the wraps. Put in a delivery order for multiple people.  I have to admit the salad looked good but the 4 people who got wraps????!  Firstly when I took them ou of the bag I thought they messed up and gave us half instead of wholes. But no, it w just that they cut them in half and wrap them one on top of other. The fact that each half was a meat 1/4\" thick did not help either. They were flat (like fold a tortilla into thirds flat) not round rolls filled with nummy filling. Even if 90% of the filling was veg I would have been happy but that one leaf of lettuce just did not have the oomph to hold the wrapper up.  So sad since they actually do deliver, guess I just have to go back to take away"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a fantastic experience at Jason's tonight.  We went there for the first time not knowing their menu or how it worked.  They were attentive and helpful while we ordered.  We got a couple of sandwiches, chips and drinks all for $20 or so.  We went to sit down to wait for our food to come out.  I hadn't even noticed how long it was since we weren't really in a rush, but about 15 minutes after we ordered the team member walking the floor noticed our wait, apologized and said she would go check on our food.  We were kind of surprised she was so attentive, but appreciated her response even though were we not upset in the slightest.  3-5 minutes later, the manager came out, apologized again, gave us a $10 gift card, and shortly after our food was ready.  
I've been many places with slow service and get frustrated by it and this wasn't slow to begin with, so it made an already good experience better knowing how in tune the staff was with everyone on the floor.  On top of a great meal, and a $10 gift card for the short wait, they have free soft serve ice cream!  
Overall a great experience and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've seen cleaner Jason's deli. Food is good people are nice but we ordered way before some cops did and we got our order after hmmm just because they are police should they be treated any better? No sorry that was disappointing"}
{"text":"Impressive menu, nice concept but some disappointment. I got the spinach veggie wrap which I envisioned being a yummy melty wrap with warm cooked veggies as was hinted in the menu saying it came in a toasted organic wheat wrap. However the insides were all raw. I expected cooked spinach & mushrooms.   Hubby got the Reuben lighter portion. The sour kraut to meat ratio was ridiculous and he has to remove the excess kraut. The remaining meat was still filling. 

On the plus side we enjoyed the free soft serve and will probably still be back since it's a cheaper and quicker alternative to standard sit down restaurants. Maybe something else on the menu will impress us."}
{"text":"I love this place! They make great food and sandwiches. I always order their Jane baked potato and it's wonderful. Pricing wise isn't too bad either. I brought my cousins along and for all 3 of us the total was about 35 dollars and we all included a sandwich and a drink. Of course, they also offer free soft serve ice cream which is my favorite. Customer service here is great. Will definitely come again and again."}
{"text":"Do not go here!! I think the Health Department needs to check this place out. The women's bathroom was disgusting. Plates of food left on tables with flies, food all over the floor and under the tables. The worst was the ice cream station with a pile of dried ice cream and broken cones on the floor. The salad bar....I can't even describe. No more words for this place.
Needless to say....we didn't stay.
In a word, nasty! I'll be posting pictures."}
{"text":"We've been coming to and enjoying this Jason's Deli for many years. They must have changed hands recently with new owners or something because the quality of both the food and the service have gone downhill in a major way. The staff has major attitude and the food is simply not up to par. So sad...another good business down the tubes. Completely unejoyable. Probably won't be coming back here anymore."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli is a great place to eat. This one in particular is brand new so it is busy most of the time. The atmosphere is just like a cafeteria and the food is wonderful. I love their chicken alfredo, it's delicious. To top it off they have free soft serve ice cream for you to enjoy after your meal. Worth the try!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Jason's Deli! The salad bar is just the best.....all the options make it so yummy. I have to say that this is the place I go when I want a great salad!! Service and prices are great. I really don't think there is a better self service salad bar than Jason's Deli!!!!"}
{"text":"Jason's Deli is pretty good, but not great.  The sandwiches are definitely above average, but they don't seem as big as everyone else says they are.  I personally like the turkey panini.  Bonus points for delivery service, and online ordering."}
{"text":"Food is good, buts that's pretty much all they have going for them. I've come to realize that when you create your own sandwich, it's merely a suggestion to the person making it. I don't remember the last time my sandwich actually came with everything I requested, or not half ass made. Have some pride in what you do."}
{"text":"First time ever eating at Jason's Deli. I ordered the Reuben and a cup of Cheddar Broccoli soup. I really enjoyed the soup. You can never go wrong with Cheddar Broccoli. The sandwich was alright too. My only complaint was it had WAY too much sauerkraut and not enough dressing. I had to take off some of the sauerkraut because it was too much. They let you help yourself to free ice cream while you're waiting for your order. The restaurant itself is really big and they have a salad bar for an extra fee. I may return in the future to try some of their other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite to eat, or food to take home, that is a healthier alternative to typical fast food. Jason's Deli offers sandwiches, different types of loaded baked potatoes, a select number of pasta dishes, soup and salad. The salad bar is one of my favorites, and for sandwiches I'm partial to the Turkey sandwich and chicken salad. 

Pros: Healthy fresh options, plenty of seating, drive through window for those days you just don't want to get out of the car, free soft serve ice cream! 

Cons: A little on the pricy side for salad and sandwiches you could in theory make yourself at home, indoor seating area is always cold so dress in layers, managers walk around the restaurant but rarely ask you if there is anything you need, beverage station was out of napkins during my most recent visit."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for lunch! I come here at least once a week. Great salad bar, soups and sandwiches. My favorites are the broccoli and cheese soup, and the reuben. They have great customer service and friendly staff. They even have vegetarian and gluten free options. I would definately reccomend giving them a try an trying it more than once."}
{"text":"If there was ever a sure bet, Jason's Deli would be it.  This is my go to lunch accommodations if all else fails.  This is a joint where you order what you want and they bring it out to you after you've sat down (sorta like McAllisters).  

My all time favorite sandwich here is 'Bird to the Wise'....yummy!  I don't get it that much because I don't have the capacity to eat it all anymore.  It's a pretty large undertaking for a lunch time meal, I don't know how I use to do it!

Here lately I've been hitting this location but there are others around town.  Also they cater and they have always done a fantastic job for me in that regard."}
{"text":"What an awesome place! I wish I had one by my house. Such a great value. The half sandwich and salad bar is only $8.50! You can pick any sandwich on the menu, not just the cheap ones. The baked potatoes are so huge that they are possibly radioactive. I kid you not, they are the size of a few regular sized baked potatoes. Also everyone gets free soft serve!!! Great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Third visit. Good food. Cllean. Staff polite and efficient   food quite good, economical and filling on all occasions.  Exceptional soup and sandwich shop and the no extra charge soft serve ice cream is a bonus."}
{"text":"I have a Love/Hate Relationship with Jason's.

I LOVE that:
~They have a Huge Menu of sandwiches, salads, soups, pasta etc.
~They have baked potatoes bigger than my head
~Their simple but perfect salad bar
~The ginger bread muffins at the salad bar * 1 reason alone to go*
~The assortment of wrapped crackers at the salad bar
~Everything  looks so good and is so big
~They always have some new \"special\" when I go in
~If you have room after lunch you can help your self to a soft serve ice cream cone

I HATE that:
~They are always packed liked sardines
~They aren't very clean
~They serve a pile of greasy broken ruffles with the sandwiches
~The Tuna isn't good
~There is barely room to walk between the tables
~The sandwiches aren't ever as good as I want them to be, but are OK nonetheless (see pics)

***3.5 stars"}
{"text":"3.5 stars to be precise.

The restaurant has a casual and clean look to it and the staff was professional! We ordered a Zucchini Grilini meatless sandwich and a Reuben, so complete contrasts of flavors and textures! Both the sandwiches were quite hearty. The Zucchini one had several things going on but still managed to individualize each flavor profile. The reuben had a little too much sauerkraut for my liking but the pastrami was nice and non-dry (I wouldn't go as far as saying it was juicy).

All in all, good food at good price. Will come again!!"}
{"text":"What a disillusionment. I had heard good stuff about this deli.
Ordered  Hot Pastrami  on a roll $6.99 w/chips. The bread must had been day old, the pastrami was cold and tough. 
I did tell the cashier that this was my first time here. She did not mention that there was complimentary ,condiments and free Ice cream bar. I had to hear if for the dude that brought me that dry breaded pastrami sandwich.
They do have pasta, what do you thing on that one?"}
{"text":"I had a 1/2 club sandwich and potato soup both which were amazing! Prices are great for what you get! I will be back."}
{"text":"Still really good! I had a 5.00 coupon for my birthday so I got a hot corned beef on rye. It was tasty. i also love that they have 4 kinds of fresh brewed tea..the black currant is so good and i have never seen it anywhere else.."}
{"text":"Great food , fast service, friendly staff. Worth 5 stars for being here for the first time!"}
{"text":"It's Open!!!

So I've been a frequent visitor of Jason's Deli over the years. I love the salad bar, the soups, the loaded potatoes and the chicken salad! This location is very clean, has plenty of seating and is environmentally pleasing to the eye.

Hubby and I went for a late lunch (3p) and there was a small line. I loved that at this location there is a self-serve kiosk if all you want is the salad bar which we decided to use. 

The staff was very friendly and consistently asked how we were doing. 

The salad bar here is just like at other locations. Of course, don't forget the free self serve ice cream but make sure you watch your kids! I witnessed a woman who was still ordering did not notice her kids sneaking over to the ice cream machine. Hahaha!"}
{"text":"Wife and me shared the salad and soup. 
Of course the soup was broccoli and cheese. 
And they have a lot of toppings for the salad bar.
Good bluecheese.
Very clean.
Easy parking."}
{"text":"Excellent broccoli cheese soup!  Recommend the salmon sandwich too.  The salad bar had a lot of different items on it, but was missing some of the standards, i.e. black olives.  But still worth the trip and I would go back here again."}
{"text":"Now I know why I do not come to this place. My fiancé just came home with our food and I ordered a rueben with bread to be extra toasted with an extra side of dressing. The bread was soggy, with barely any 1000 island on the sandwich, and no extra dressing. I will not be ordering from here again. This was horrible."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh fare at the salad bar. Probably my most bitter salad -  mixed dark greens and spinach with Bleu Cheese crumbles and dressing, plus some Kalamita olives - all balanced by the 1/2 sweet tea 1/2 black currant tea."}
{"text":"On my way home from work on those days when I need to pick up dinner, my mind immediately takes me to Jason's Deli.  Their food is high quality and fresh; not fast food or greasy burgers.  Their menu offers many different options from homemade soups; pastas (such as Chicken Alfredo or Penne Pasta with Meatballs); assorted salads; Po'boy sandwiches or build your own sandwich with your choice of meats, breads, various cheeses and extras such as avocado slices and oven roasted herb tomatoes, organic field greens, and organic spinach, all on a build your own sandwich of your own choosing.  They also have \"Favorite\" sandwiches.  My favorite by far is the Beefeater Sandwich (roast beef on French bread) with cup of au jus or the Club Royale - Delicious!  By the way, don't forget the extensive and wide variety Salad Bar -- not to be missed!"}
{"text":"My kiddos enjoy visiting Jason's Deli.

Con: 
 Ordered the soup once, it was chicken noodle thick and salty goo. I would suggest diluting the soup so its more watery and less salty. 

Kids chicken strips weren't warmed all the way on 2 occasions, and the portion is tiny in comparison to everything else we decided not to try again after receiving cold strips twice.

Last couple times I ordered a half sandwich and side salad the employee disappeared with the seeds and nuts for the salad bar for an hour. I've stopped ordering side salad now.

Need to ask for no butter, or light sauce on sweet potatoes. Also need to ask for light sauce on sandwiches.

The chocolate syrup has been out the last three visits with the kiddos. (Win for Mom, not for kiddos)

Pros:
Great salad bar with good options
The food usually arrives quickly
Great price on kids meals and a couple meals my kiddos will eat.. Pizza, and Bow tie pasta with meatballs
Soft serve is included
The three of us walk out spending less than $30

The air can be pretty cold in there, remember a sweater!"}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying I love Jason's Deli's salad bar and free ice cream cones. I mean who doesn't like ice cream.

This trip was my first time at the Epicentre location. It didn't disappoint.  Definitely was more crowded than what I'm used to, but they were efficient in their order taking and had bus boys turning over tables left and right.  

The locations not very ideal for a large group over 4 or so, as the space is limited. But if you want fast and good food. This is an affordable option Uptown."}
{"text":"I was a bake potato whore when I first started eating at Jason's Deli.  Now I like to try everything at least once on the menu.  

Their sandwiches are still top tier, I don't usually go for the salads though.  But they have a nice selection to choose from.  They have tons of parking spaces, you may have to park farther than you want though because of the market within the same area.  

You can ask for a to go cup, I always do.  Crackers, corn bread, garlic toast are complimentary.  And so are the ice cream and cones!  

My favorite soup:  French onion."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since I graduated college in '02.  I never ate in a deli before so this was my first experience.  Boy am I glad I went!  This place is always busy for lunch, so that's a pretty good sign the food is good.

Their menu was big, with lots of sandwiches, po'boy subs, paninins, BIG (I mean like almost foot long big) baked potatoes, soups, wraps, pasta, and even a full service salad bar with all the fixins'.  I had never been there before so I asked what suggestions they had.  The order taker told me to try the 'New York Yankee'.  It is a sandwich made with pastrami and corned beef on rye bread, with Swiss cheese and mustard.  It also came with chips and a pickle.  It was a great first choice, this bad boy was huge!  The sandwich itself was like 6 inches in height.  The pastrami and corned beef were moist and flavorful, and went great with the Swiss and rye.  Not half bad for only $7.99.

Their sweet tea is pretty bomb too, almost as good as Raising Cane's.  Cane's is better mainly because of their pellet-shaped ice.  Their salad bar is nothing to laugh at either.  Lots of fresh choices, and even whole hard-boiled eggs which were great (unlike Sweet Tomatoes where they shred it up).  They even have free Garlic Toast and mini muffins, as well as various crackers that are complimentary to all patrons.  Not just that...but they also have free soft serve ice cream!  Well, free if you buy something to eat.  On second thought, I never asked if ice cream came with everything on the menu.  I kinda just helped myself to the machine everytime I ate there.  Nonetheless, I never got busted for it.  So.....therefore, it must be free!

Not a bad place to have a great lunch with a bunch of your friends.  I would have given this place 5 stars, but I went there recently for dinner and found out the portions aren't quite what they used to be.  It was rather slow with no one in there.  Instead of my 6 inch high sandwich, this time is was maybe an inch shorter.  Boo.  This time the soft serve ice cream machine was broken too.  Double Boo.  So stick to this place for lunch, with busier crowds they tend to do better food."}
{"text":"Need a quick deli fix?  Then try Jason's!  It may be a chain, but it still serves up some great deli eats.  

I now have a new favorite.  I used to just order one of three of Jason's Deli menu items - All-You-Can-Eat Salad Bar (so much better than Sweet Tomatoes even though soup isn't included), Reuben the Great (really, it's great), and The New York Yankee (Jeter ain't got nothin' on this grand slam).  Each a great choice in its own right.  I know, I know, none of it is 'authentic' NY deli food but sometimes you don't wanna pay an arm and a leg for a sandwich (no matter how tasty).  

But now I have a new favorite.  The BEEFEATER.  Damn.  I never thought I would talk about myself.  Eating beef.  Almost sounds naughty!  I passed by this item a million times looking at the menu and finally got curious enough to get it.  Good choice!  The Beefeater is a 1/2 pound of hot roast beef, provolone cheese, and mayo all on New Orleans French bread with a side of au jus.  Yes, it is akin to a French Dip.  Though as a tip, ask for it to be TOASTED...it brings out some needed crunch and bubbly cheese.  And for another tip, ask for a side of creamy horseradish!  They will usually have to whip some up for you since it's not a common condiment.  This I believe is necessary.  It brings the sucker up a notch!  Seriously, it is one of the better sandwiches I've had in a long time.  I think about it every time now when I debate if I want some Jason's Deli.

The hot roast beef, the melty cheese, the crunchy bread, slathered in creamy horseradish...then dipped in tasty au jus!  Oh yeah...make me sing like Mariah then slap me and call me Nick Cannon.  It's yummy, and oh just a little bit messy.  But oh so delicious!  I really can't wait to have another one.

I will be back!  Hopefully sooner than later.

DELI - cious!"}
{"text":"This the wifey's and my go-to place for lunch on Sunday after church!!  Hallelujah!!!

Sure, Jason's Deli is a chain but they still make some pretty decent sandwiches at some very good value!!  My usual favorites are:

*Beefeater - 1/2 pound of roast beef, provolone, mayo (extra for me), toasted on New Orleans French bread with a cup of au jus.  Ask for a side of horseradish sauce!  Add a roasted red pepper from the salad bar too!  Trust me!

*Deli Club - ham, roasted turkey breast, bacon, cheddar, Swiss, lettuce, tomato, mayo (again, extra for me), on toasted multigrain wheat

Some tasty sandwiches done right!!  Don't forget the free sides of cornbread & pumpernickel mini-muffins, and assorted crackers from the salad bar!  Complimentary soft-serve too!!  A complete meal from start to finish, and we often leave with leftovers for later!  If you order right, you shouldn't be leaving Jason's Deli hungry!

Their salad bar and their massive baked potatoes are crowd favorites.  Their AYCE salad bar is actually cheaper than Sweet Tomatoes, with many comparable choices!  I like that Jason's Deli will sometimes serve alfalfa sprouts, even though they can be high on the bacteria.  And their salad bar serves whole boiled eggs!  Likin' their whole beets and pickle spears on the line too.  

Leave Jason's Deli light on the wallet too!  Many of their main entrees are priced at $10 or under.  Save that money for some bingo tickets!"}
{"text":"I had the Cuban panini and it was on point. It had so much flavor and pricing was fair. I've also had their soups and they are also very flavorful. The free ice cream is great as my daughters were eager to finish their dinner. They had the Mac and cheese and basically were short of licking the bowl clean."}
{"text":"I have been to Jason's Deli quite a few times since living in Vegas at 2 of their locations.  I never actually \"CRAVE\" their food nor am I ever dying to go there.  The food is fine but that's all.  The salad bar is fresh but nothing exciting.  

Their Fire tortilla chicken soup is very good as is their French Onion soup.  I can't recall which sandwiches I have had but nothing comes to mind as exceptional.  My husband usually orders Reuben or pastrami sandwiches which he has decreed as \"good\" but in no way comparable to The Bagel Cafe.  

They have wonderful fresh brewed iced tea (Black Currant is my favorite).  This is a good place for lunch if you want to try to have healthy options.  Easy to feed your kids here plus they have free ice cream."}
{"text":"This is really a review of the salad bar: peas, peppers, mushrooms, lettuce, mixed greens, spinach, two kinds of potato salad, ~6 dressings, crunchy stuff, zucchini, two pasta salads, quinoa salad, and some other things. Great salad bar (all you can eat) for like $8. Everything was fresh, clean, and the staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"I love Jason's Deli because I can have a quality sandwich on gluten free bread. There aren't many places that have sandwich offerings for GF folks like me. 

I can't speak to the salad bar or any of the soups -- but I definitely recommend the California Club sandwich. It's always good, always filling, and the price is right."}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant and I called in BLT in over the phone, so that way my order would be ready when I got there. I was excited about the energy of the staff when I walked through the door. But I was not happy since the cashier whom happened to be the manager did not have my order in the system. His name was Chris and he informed me that he probably took my order and has been so busy forgot to input in the machine. 

So I was so psyched about trying a BLT with egg and avocado, but it took the cook forever to make the sandwich. I was the only order that they did have at this particular time. The manager was busy doing paperwork at the register so could not light any kind of fire for the ladies making my sandwich. The food when I did receive it was fantastic but something is rotten in their ordering routine."}
{"text":"Great deli. Good sandwhiches, and soups, awesome salad bar."}
{"text":"Always satisfied with all the food and the service.  Great place to come. In addition to the food being top notch, all their employees as always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Chicken salad on croissant sweetened with pineapple made to perfection.  Brisket sandwich equally delish. So glad I found this place."}
{"text":"The food is decent, but their delivery fees are crazy stupid! Must spend 25$ before tax or their 9$ delivery fee? Yea way to make people not want to tip. I'll just order from Panera"}
{"text":"Great Food. Great Prices. & They Deliver!

Ordered here for lunch at work and I got a decent sized turkey and Munster on herb focasia bread, a bag of chips, a pickle, a walnut brownie and a drink all for $10.00 and some change!  

Thats a ton of food for a decent price and everything was delicious!

My co workers both got pasta dishes and they had nothing bad to say as well!

I will definitely be ordering from here at work from now on!"}
{"text":"2 stars for customer service, but the food was good so bumping them up to 3 stars... 

I had been waiting for this location to open for a while, as I work fairly close to it and we are always on the lookout for new places to get lunch. I needed to run an errand on my lunch break recently, so I called in an order to go for myself and a coworker. 

My first impression upon arriving was that the management didn't care enough about the customers waiting to order or pay. I called in my order to try to save myself some time... When it was my turn to pay, the cashier was being spoken to by both district manager and the store manager (I could tell their position by their name badges) which is fine, the place had just recently opened and it's likely there was still training occurring.

What was not fine in my opinion was that after another employee asked me if I had been helped, he tried to get the cashier to ring me up. BOTH of the managers looked over to the register, saw me waiting as well as multiple others behind me, and decided to continue their conversation with the cashier. When they finished talking, all three walked over to the register and made eye contact with me, but only the cashier apologized for the wait. 

Thankfully my food was ready by the time I was rang up so I didn't have to wait any longer. The food itself was good, I had the Club Royale which had a lot of meat which is nice, some places skimp.  would have preferred a fruit cup rather then cups for a side but the additional cost for the healthier option was a little ridiculous. 

I don't see myself going back for another try for a while, hopefully another month or two the staff of Jason's Deli will get their system figured out and hopefully management will realize the importance of respecting their customer's time."}
{"text":"My office typically orders Jason's to go, but if you feel like getting out, it's worth it.  Kind of a pain to get to but the salad bar is serious business.  For $7.99, you get unlimited trips to the small, but well-rounded offerings, fluorescent glow included free of charge.  It's not a huge salad bar, but it has everything you need to have a good lunch.  Added bonus:  Captain's Wafers!  Those crackers take me back to childhood!  I would suggest avoiding the patio though, as there is always some vagrant milling about.

If you are not looking for an excuse to be less productive, Jason's delivers ($3 charge I think) and I would recommend the turkey reuben.  Super good and under 550 calories with baked lays and a pickle."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is fresh and delicious  Always crowed I had a Reuben sandwich. Price $8.79. Hugh sandwich to share. Another favorite is seafood gumbo. I am sad they ran out of gumbo today. I think this is a good place when you are hungry because the food come out really fast. One thing I don't like is the parking. Not many spots to park there. I park across the street and walk in."}
{"text":"Oh yum I love Jasons deli. Give me that salad bar. I go nuts for the salad bar and I don't even know why! Maybes its the tiny corn muffins, or just the mix. Its nice that I can go back again (hint Field Kitchen). I always get a nice sample for me and for the baby to try. Sometimes if I am in the mood I will order some soup too but its usually just the salad bar.
I really like the option that I can jump the line and pay at the salad bar and soup line. It saves time during a busy lunch rush. I feel like a VIP when I do that.
Also, everyone gets free soft serve. Its pretty good.
The people are always friendly and clean up the tables really fast. I love this place and will return a lot for lunch."}
{"text":"I love Jason's Deli but this location is so inconsistent that it drives me mad. The food isn't something to write home about but it's decent. The salad bar is good when it's stocked. I've eaten here several times when the cherry tomatoes were wrinkled and way past their prime, the sad broccoli was floating in a tub of water, and the lettuce and other containers have been close to empty. Other times I've encountered a bountiful, fresh salad bar. 

The food can be hit or miss and the portions have been shrinking while the prices have been rising. At least they seem to understand when I ask for \"no bread\" with my sandwich (low carb style), but you'd think they'd knock off 50 cents or something since I'm not being served the bread (which is the bulk of their sandwiches, believe me). I often leave here hungry because the portions are so minuscule. I've been served strawberries that were so mushy they had thumbprints in them and chicken breast that was microwaved so long that you couldn't even chew it. I don't tend to like restaurants that have microwaves out front and center -- what kind of message does that send about the quality?

Bonus points for the fact that they always have tasty, fresh strawberries all year long. I don't know how they do that! I always sub a cup of berries for the potato chips (that will cost you $2 extra!!). Make sure you buy a big refillable soda mug and you can get 99 cent refills for the life of the mug!"}
{"text":"The Pineville store is MY Jason's. Service is always great. Several employees greeted me when I came in and they were busy too. I always feel welcome. I do love the instant salad bar line where you can jump the big line and order a salad (plus soup and proteins) on a card-only kiosk. I NEVER wait which is one of the reasons I go to Jason's. The other main reason I go to Jason's is the salad bar. It's always fresh and has some nice extras. The only negatives are that frequently the lettuce is wetter than I like and they put ice down in some of the vegetables which ends up in my salad. Also I miss the cauliflower!
Minor details. They do a good job at Jason's Pineville."}
{"text":"This is a really bad Jason's Deli location. The quality of the food has continued to deteriorate. I ate here last week and had the salad bar. The lettuce was wilted and the cherry tomatoes were so old that they tasted rancid and had wrinkly skins. The restaurant itself is in a state of disrepair and the common areas, tables and countertops were all filthy. I don't know what's going on here but hopefully somebody from corporate can swoop in and fix the issues. I won't be back here until something changes."}
{"text":"I've heard lots of great things about this deli so while in the area I figured I'd give the a try. The service was great! I went with a build your own sandwich, turkey bacon with provolone cheese on a French roll! All the pictures of sandwich and those that came out before mines had melted cheese but I get home to 2 pieces of cold cheese slapped on top on my toasted sub almost as if they forgot to add it durning its baking process and added it at the last minute. This was I huge disappointment being all the sandwiches presented so well as they came out of the cook area! As far as taste, the sandwich is pretty good. The lesson I've learned, check my food be for I leave if I'm not going to sit down and eat there!"}
{"text":"NO MORE Peanut Butter Cookies :( AND they stopped making my favorite wrap - The Maverick. No reason to go back."}
{"text":"I just returned from this deli.  YUK.  I ordered french onion soup and the salad bar.  The best part was the diet soda.  The french onion tasted like canned beef broth.  I never got to the onion part.  The cheese rather than being well done or crispy was barely melted and made the soup disgusting.  The salad bar was mostly out of cans, bottles of boxes.  The potato salad was awful, the tuna with penne salad was inedible and the salad dressings were all out of a bottle.  The place wasn't very clean either.  When I approached the manager to refund my meal, she questioned me.  I didn't like that much either although she did give me back the money.  I guess she doesn't know how many people in Las Vegas work in the F&B industry here in our hotels.  I would save your appetite for another deli."}
{"text":"I went to Jason's Deli on a recommendation from friends, knowing that I'm a soup/salad/sandwich-type food lover. But, I'd say that I'm pretty picky about which places I like, because if you're going to get me to pay $7 for a sandwich, it better be darn good. 

Jason's Deli was good. I'd definitely go again. I had a half ham & swiss on french bread and a cup of their cheddar broccoli soup. Yummy. They also have a huge salad bar that I'd like to try out on my next visit. 

Downside- all sandwiches come with a handful of potato chips. Wondering if they have any alternative for those of us not a fan of greasy chips? Will find out on the next trip

PS, outdoor seating, FTW"}
{"text":"It was fine. Not amazing food but not expensive either. It was a good value overall; the loaded potato was giant and very good, the salmon sandwich was good if a little bland."}
{"text":"I love this place, I always order the Turkey club, the combo getting chips and a pickle. The sandwiches are huge and can really fill you up. They have a soup and salad bar and plenty of drink choices. My husband and I have always had great customer service whenever we come in."}
{"text":"Spicy Gumbo really surprised me. Good stuff you gotta  try it!!! Everything thing that I have ate at Jason's is consistently good!"}
{"text":"Awesome veggie soup! Hands down one of the best vegetarian soups I have ever had. They have a ton of menu items including: sandwiches, paninis, soups, a salad bar, etc... Love this place."}
{"text":"I had a chicken panini and was more than enough! It was dinner and lunch!

They have this special bread that is like a big bun. The people is very friendly and patient to explain their different options. Nice place, and for sandwiches it was just good."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a healthy restaurant as I am working out... and wanting to trim a few more pounds... and so.. decided to check out Jason's Deli.  I was delighted to experience the atmosphere.... it is a classy, walk up and order style deli, with a large room, not a lot of people, hip music.... friendly staff....  my Salad Bar, bowl of French Onion Soup, and Nantucket Nectars Pomegranate Cherry 16 oz Juice came to about $12.62.   I could have gone to any other restaurant, but the quality of the food, the freshness, the variety etc. made this a good choice and much healthier...!  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Do not go here hoping for anything similar to a Jewish deli. Or, really, a deli. It is a sandwich shop. The food isn't bad, I enjoyed a chicken salad sandwich, but the staff seemed kinda clueless."}
{"text":"Went to Jason's Deli to try out their salad bar yesterday. It was my first experience with their salad bar and I'm sorry to say it will be my last. I was very disappointed with their offerings. On their website they said they have added organic options but there were no signs saying what was organic so who knows if anything was. Their toppings weren't salad topping as much as they were veggies. Example: whole baby carrots are not what I would consider a salad topping unless I want to cut up the carrots myself. I will say I managed to put a little more than lettuce on my plate, so fine. I also tried one of the pasta salads - yuck. It had almost a sour flavor to it. And I tried some of the fruit salad - tasted chemically - they probably spray their fruit so it doesn't brown.

Their \"famous\" mini muffins were also a major disappointment. The cornbread one was dry, the gingerbread one was just okay. Again, kinda fake tasting. 

And really, for the price I would expect some kind of meat offering - chicken or turkey would be nice.

But the worst part came later that afternoon when I got a horrible stomach ache.  

Never again."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here just for the loaded baked potatoes! The place could use a little updating. Service was a bit slow our last visit, but the cashier apologized and gave us free soft drinks."}
{"text":"The service was slow and the Muffaletta was not very good. The bread was too thick and the relish was harsh of olives and not very balanced. The meat what little there was of was ok but a real Muffaletta has mortadella, salami ham and provolone. The chili was this an kind of salty and didn't have very many onions. Will give another chance possibly but not a stellar dining experience."}
{"text":"I usually go to this Jason's location for the salad bar 3-4 times a month. We decided to stop in Saturday night around 7:30pm. The place wasn't busy. We wanted to sit in a booth, but all the tables were dirty and had not been cleared. We ordered our salads and found a seat near the back. The food at the salad bar tasted like it had been sitting out for hours. Nothing was fresh and the gingerbread and cornbread muffins were stale. When we left about 45 minutes later, we noticed all eight tables still hadn't been cleaned. The food is usually good, but we were really disappointed to the point that we don't want to return."}
{"text":"I took my order to go from Jason's deli and it was a quick non painful experience. I did see a worker named Jason go out of his way to help a family who spilled their drink on the table. It was nice to see someone caring about other people. I still think this place is over priced so I gave it 3 instead of 4 stars. The New York Yankee is pretty damn good."}
{"text":"I've been a fan since the day Jason's Deli opened Uptown. I've tried lots of their menu options as well as their fully-stocked, fresh salad bar. The restaurant is well maintained and clean. My disappointment has been the baked potatoes. I recently discovered the Texas Style Spud. It's delicious!  However, the last two times I ordered it the potato has been burned. You don't know that until you start eating it. What a disappointment. I did call and say something but I never heard from anyone."}
{"text":"The muffuletta is really good, so is the seafood gumbo. But it seems like one of their main selling points is the salad bar which is a pretty dismal affair. You don't make friends with salad, especially wilted salad"}
{"text":"We live close to this location so over the past few years we have eaten here a few times....Sadly, we have come to the conclusion that we just don't like this place. It just has to do with taste - most of the food doen't have any and if it does there's too much salt. Things I've tried: Southwestern Chicken Stuffed Baked Potato
          BBQ Brisket Stuffed Baked Potato
          Tomato Bisque soup
           Grilled Cheese
           Fettucini Pasta
           Turkey and Ham Sandwich
umm, that's all I can remember right now but even from those items I can't say I liked any one of those except for their Strawberry Shortcake!
The one positive thing they have going for them is the Strawberry shortcake - It's hellah good - I drop by here just for it- that's one item they know how to do. The place is spacious, always clean and the employees are nice.The free Icecream  sure does rock my daughthers world but the STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE rules!!!"}
{"text":"I make it a point to stop in to Jason's often because their food is really good and salad bar has some many great choices.  One of the best pastrami sandwiches I have found and the 1/2 a sandwich with 1 trip to the salad bar is total deal.  This is easily one of the best salad bars in town for the money.  The restaurant is impressive and looks upscale with the decor. I'm now a fan of Jason's Deli and always visit when I'm at my 2nd home in Vegas.  Just good food at a good price."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the past 4 years or so, I just never \"checked in\". I walked in at 2:20pm and they close at 3:00 pm so I was glad I made it and was able to eat lunch.
I had the MANAGER'S special which is half a sandwich, cup of soup and chips. I had the beefeater French onion soup, and Baked lay's chips. I can't remember ever having a bad experience at this Jason's Deli, you are greeted when you come In the door and overall a enjoyable experience.

They currently have a \"free cookie\" when you check in, I'm sure it's only a first time check in and not every time you visit.

 When your done with your meal they have the complimentary ice cream cone which you get to enjoy in your way out if you drove in for lunch.
Be sure to get your parking ticket validated and also park on the level you drive into."}
{"text":"Ah, what can I say, Jason's Deli makes a darn fine sandwich.  I ordered a Rueben today as did a few co-workers.  We ordered for delivery.  It took a while but it arrived exactly when they said it would.  I was impressed.  The corned beef was stacked high.  The cheese was well melted.  The sauerkraut was mild.  If I have any complaints it is that the bread was a little on the soggy side by the time it arrived because of the Russian dressing (which I could not taste because it was soaked in to the bread).  Other than that, a dang fine sandwich.  It was filling.  It was flavorful.  I enjoyed it.  The pickle spear and bag of chips on the side were a bonus.  All together, $7.99 for this meal was worth it.  I think next time I would like to try a baked potatoe.  I hear good things.  And I know their chili is good.  Maybe a potatoe with chili is not out of the question."}
{"text":"As far as Deli food goes this place has it going on !!!! Not an east coast /Jewish deli (which is where my heart belongs) but Jason's holds their own . They have a salad bar, and FREE ICE CREAM .. Oh happy day !! I had the 1/2 prime rib sandwich and a cup of lobster chowder . The sandwich was great ! Meat was tender , bread was fresh . Lobster chowder was ok. There are plenty more Items on the menu that need to be tackled !"}
{"text":"This is another one we found on Yelp Mobile. Sometimes you read short Yelp reviews and they don't help you at all. But Erika B.'s post on 11-5-09 couldn't have been on the money in describing Jason's Deli: \"I try to stay away from chains, but I went here with [family] and liked it ... The order line is kinda unorganized which made it a little confusing.\" That was exactly our experience here, too.

We escaped Red Rock and headed towards the Rampart-Charleston row of chain restaurants and retailers, maybe 10 blocks of regional and national eateries to choose from. Of the 30-40 choices, Jason's seemed a good lunch destination for the family.  

To add to Erika B's post, Jason's has a good selection of sandwich meat and hot lunch choices, and their French roll tasted fresh and was the right crispiness. The salad bar looked ok, and the dozen soup choices should please any palate. The half-sandwich/soup combo I ordered was a good lunch deal, with the chili I chose being slightly more watery than meaty, but still good. 

If you have the will-power to pass on the $2 drinks and sodas, you can do well here for your lunch money."}
{"text":"This is my go to place to get a fix of home (TX). Originally from Beaumont, TX and now based out of Austin, TX...this is one of my favorite chains from Texas. 

I always get the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich and a cup of their Chicken Pot Pie Soup (see picture). Their salad bar is great too because of the choices. Surprisingly this bar is smaller than what I'm used to. Everything IS bigger in Texas. 

The corn muffins and ginger muffins are so fresh. Plus they always have frozen yogurt. It's so yummy. 

This location in particular is soooo clean. They are prompt and friendly. I highly recommend this place for lunch but it was also perfect for a light dinner. Great for families and good for solo trips. Don't forget that they have specials (half sandwich, half soup/salad...Manager's specials). Price is always decent and you can choose from baked chips or Ruffles!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Jason's Deli through my co-workers as we only worked a few minutes away. We got there just after noon the first time, and to be expected, it was very busy. The lines go fast though. 

However, there's something I just don't like about this place. I've been to some really good delis in New York (and even around Las Vegas) and it's hard to really compete. I wasn't expecting much, but still, this place just seems like one of those compromises you make because you're really hungry at lunch and don't feel like arguing with your co-workers. My first trip there I ordered a pot roast sandwich and received some sort of pastrami monstrosity that I had to dissect like a pig fetus before I could fit it reasonably in my mouth. The pastrami was gristly, dry and salty and I was kind of turned off. 

The next time I went there I got some kind of California croissant with avocado and turkey that wasn't bad. But it's kind of expensive - like $8 - $10 bucks a sandwich. I could go to a lot of better places for that kind of money. After a soda it's like 12 or 13 bucks. 

Now when I go I just get the chili, which is pretty good all around. I've never been disappointed with the chili. The ambiance is loud. There are usually tons of people there at lunch (many with kids running around and screaming their heads off - like a Little Rascals episode) and usually some sort of supervisor woman yelling \"Service!\" or something to her servers every time an order needs to go out which adds to a kind of 1930s Soviet sweatshop vibe. Again, kind of a turn off, but I'll still go back if I'm really hungry. It's convenient."}
{"text":"I first learned about this place when they catered a company event and I picked a box that had a turkey ham and bacon club sandwich that was simply incredible.  The bread was toasted and the bacon was on point, one of the best club sandwiches I've had.  I went to the restaurant to get the same sandwich again but that particular sandwich is for the catered lunch boxes only.  I ordered a croissant club royale hoping for a the same experience.  It wasn't nearly as good but still decent.

If you are catering an event you should get Jason's Deli.  Those cater lunch boxes are amazing."}
{"text":"Jason's deli is a good place to grab lunch, if you're able to sit down and eat at the establishment, but not if you have a limited lunch time and order online where it's supposed to be convenient. This is the ONLY Jason's Deli that I've been to that has greatly disappointed me. Not just once but TWO times.

Since this location is closest to my work place and I don't have much time to order during work, I like to take advantage of the online ordering system they have available before I get to work. The first time I ordered from here, I placed my order (half a tuna sandwich and a cup of pot pie soup) 3 hours ahead of time and specified the time I'd be there to pick it up(5-530). I get to the location, pay for my order and wait. About 10 minutes into my wait, the manager notifies me that they had to remake my order because they somehow made it 3 hours earlier then they were suppose to. I had to wait longer than I expected to wait and was almost late going back to work. Luckily I wasn't late but I also couldn't just sit and enjoy my food like I had intended since I was short on time. 

I hadn't intended to go back but after a few months I decided to give the place a second chance since I wanted chicken pot pie soup after coming off of a 10 day cleanse. Again I played it safe and ordered my bowl of pot pie online 4 hours earlier and indicated the time(5-530) I would be in to pick it up. When I got there I payed for the order placed under my name and waited. The cashier told me my order should be ready but it wasn't when he went to check. So I sat and waited. Mind you, all I ordered was a BOWL of soup. 5 minutes, 10 minutes went by. At that point I asked how long it was going to be since apparently I was FORGOTTEN. The girl cashier went to check and informed me that it hadn't been done and was telling the kitchen to make it since I'd been waiting for a while. The manager (or that's who he seemed to be) came over and asked me how I had placed my order and I told him I placed it online. He proceeded to ask if I had received a confirmation email, which I did. He went to check on his little computer and informed me that it must not have been in their system and it was never made. But how can an order NOT be received when I received a confirmation email AND paid for it when it was under my name? I continued to wait and another 5 minutes pass and the girl cashier comes back to tell me that they were waiting on the pastry that goes with the soup to be made. At this point I am heated and wanted to just storm out but since I paid for my BOWL of soup, I waited. Finally at 5:25pm the manager is packing up the soup and handing it to me while stating \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience and I'll be sure to take care of the bill.\" That was an out right LIE. Don't sit there and say something you don't mean just to keep customers happy. The lie is what makes them more mad. There's no way that the order didn't exist in the system. I was simply forgotten about after I paid for my order. I placed the order 4 hours early online. I didn't realize a BOWL of soup take 4 hours and some change to get ready. Needless to say, I don't intend on wasting my time at Jason's again."}
{"text":"UGH. I gave you another chance, Jason, and you served me a pasta salad with more oil than the Exxon spill. Thanks for the headache."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli is one of the reasons I regret moving out of Arizona.  The food quality and value are very good, and their service is stellar.  Today as I took a \"to go\" order out, I glanced at the ice cream machine and the manager came by and said \"here let me get you a to-go cup for some ice cream.\"  Great service.

Pros:
+ Great variety of fresh food, always tasty.  I recommend the Smokey Jack Panini and the Turkey Muffalletta.
+ The sides are also very good.  3 bean salad, soups and a robust salad bar.
+ Free garlic toast, corn muffins, bran muffins and soft serve ice cream.
+ Always superior customer service here.  They make me feel like a valued customer every time I come in.

Cons:
- The french onion soup can be oily sometimes.
- The line at lunchtime can be 20+ people so try to avoid \"rush hour\" if you can.

Overall, I'd give this place six stars if Yelp let me.  A truly great deli restaurant."}
{"text":"We went last night and it was not crowded at all. It did seem to take a while to order as there's quite a selection to choose from. The food was very good and they brought it to the table after giving you a number to place on a stand. They reminded us that they offer free ice cream cones and that was actually very good. The food was clean healthy and tasty. My wife had a half sandwich and a cup of soup which was fine for her. I had a full sandwich with a bowl of soup and actually it was too much. They did get confused and did not deliver the bowl of soup as we had paid for and they apologized. They had to take it out of somewhere and heat it up it sounded like. But all in all it was an excellent place to eat off of the strip and was not crowded was clean and safe."}
{"text":"I pretty much only go here when I am craving a potato the size of my head, so maybe twice a year. I get the Plain Jane sans bacon. Check out my pic, this thing is a beast! I can never finish the whole thing, so I advise splitting it. They have a decent salad bar and they do a nice turkey reuben.  If I lived closer I would for sure put Jason's in my regular lunch rotation!"}
{"text":"I ordered from here for the first time, and had it delivered to work. The online ordering process is very easy to use, allowing you to make adjustments to the ingredients on each item. You can also make a credit card payment online, and add the tip. This was great.

The delivery was made exactly when promised. The food was packed very nicely as well. I was not happy with my choice though. It sounded so much better in writing than it actually tasted. I ordered the Mediterranean Wrap. Roasted turkey breast, roasted red pepper hummus, cucumbers, red onions, kalamata olives, Roma tomatoes, organic field greens in an organic wheat wrap. I chose no onion. There was almost no hummus on this wrap. It just tasted like turkey and cucumber with some greens. There was a lot of extra wrap, as it was not very full of ingredients. I was extremely disappointed in this wrap. I would not hesitate to order something else from here though. The online ordering and the service were great."}
{"text":"Good service, good food, I keep coming back.

Food:
Tonight I had my old standby Ranchero Wrap. I generally substitute soup for the chips, but an employee suggested the Quinoa salad, and it was great! 

Cost: 
$8.84, including tax wasn't bad at all. Good value.

Service: 
The staff was cheerful and helpful, as always. My order came out quickly.

Atmosphere:
Clean, not too noisy, nothing remarkable.

Overall:
The food is mostly very good, and this place stays on my go-to list. Next time I might try the salad bar, since they appear to have added some new and interesting items. Read less"}
{"text":"I really like this place, I love to get their soups and half sandwich in the winter months and they salad bar in the spring and summer. 
Go early or call in ur order unless u do not mind waiting. The wait could be long so I suggest unless u do not care go r 11:00.
The c.s. is great and very nice.
The have great desserts."}
{"text":"Terrible.  They stuck a small toothpick sideways hidden in sandwich. Lucky I didn't choke. Their cheese is left out so when they put in a salad its hard. The old owner ran that place like clockwork. This place is run like a broken watch. If I could give no stars I would."}
{"text":"It's a good place to eat, the price is reasonable. I think everyone knows what to expect when they go there.
I like the atmosphere. Salad bar is consistent, I really like the option of being able to eat healthy., or if you want to slam down a lot of bread and processed meat you can do that to.
I do think that some people are taking advantage of the free ice cream a little too much."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Jason's deli . The salad bar is always so good and it's always stocked . Staff is super friendly"}
{"text":"Had a group of 15, most had never been here.  They wait staff was helpful and set up a table for us as soon as we walked in.  The food was great!  I would recommend any of it.  The food came out all at once.  Will definitely come here again next time I'm in the Vegas area.  The beefeater, Cuban and Reuben were just a few of the things we ordered."}
{"text":"We have been regular customers of this Jason's Deli for the past 4 years.... but we went in, anxious for our regular orders: A trip to the Salad Bar and a bowl of French Onion Soup. We were told that Jason's no longer makes the soup. How disappointing! It was the BEST French Onion anywhere! We walked out vowing never to return, since that's the MAIN reason we always came to Jason's. I still give it 2 stars for all the great times we ate there. A shame!"}

I work a 9-5er in uptown (no I'm not calling it \"the city\" or \"city\"...Charlotte is more small town than big city to me.....even with a few skyscrapers...well, two that truly can scrape the sky so-to-speak....Sorry, I digress.

So I bumped into an old manager from my NationsBank days....yes, I'm also dating myself as does any banker that talks about banks they worked for and names you probably never even heard of....and we decided to do lunch at Jason.  This was a salad day for me...lots of meeting, so a big meal wasn't in the cards, unless I planned on falling half asleep in a meeting lasting hours and hours.  So I didn't get to experience the sandwich line, which wasn't a bad thing as it was almost out the door when we arrived around 11:40 in the morning?!?!?!

I had never been here before, so I followed the lead of my acquaintance as he seems to have been here several times.  There are 2 self serve kiosks for soup/salads, which had very small lines.  I ordered a salad with chicken...went over to my left to the counter where I was given a tray, empty white unbreakable plastic bowl and a small cup of cooked chicken.....though I've never been to prison...\"convicted....no.......never convicted\" I think I may have had a little taste of what it was liked being herded around like sheep with my prison like tray, bowl and fellow eaters all walking around in a well formed process.

The salad bar is good...though basic...nothing very creative here.  We ate, caught up on our work over the years and headed out.
The place itself sits on the second floor of the EPICENTER in the corner of College and 4th with lots of windows, so it is light and bright.  The food was fine...pricing wasn't anything special...total for lunch (with water) (was $9.26 with tax = Salad $6.99 + Chicken $1.49 + tax).

Fast....but only if you go the salad route....avg pricing, though $9 for lunch is not cheap if you eat out lunch every day.  All and all a generally good...can be quick depending....lunch spot in the center of town."}
{"text":"If you want a quiet lunch in the city, this is a place to go. Located on the second level of Epicentre, this restaurant serves typical deli food at reasonable prices. Even during the lunch hour, when the restaurant is at its busiest, the food arrives quickly, and it is easy to find a seat. The eating area is well lit, with large windows on one side for views of the city. 

There are no waiters; rather, you order at the front and your food is brought to you. The only negative experience I've ever had was when my order was marked \"to-go\" when I wanted to sit down. I sat for 20 minutes before I looked at my receipt and figured it out. In response, I received a personal apology, my food within 5 minutes, and my cash refunded."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for a bagel sandwich and it was the worst thing I've ever eaten. Plenty of staff on hand and it still took that long to make such a disgusting meal. Will never go back."}
{"text":"We go to Jason's deli about once a week. You order the food and they bring it to the table. They have a very good salad bar. I like the salmon sandwich. They also have pasta, baked potatoes and lots of other options.  They also offer complimentary ice cream which the kids love.  The staff is always very friendly."}
{"text":"I was visiting Arizona, and my friends who live there kept on taking me to places which specialised in \"heart attack on a plate\" meals, involving lots of fat, and not a lot of greens. I was really craving something healthy, when my new best friend took me to Jason's. I love this place! Lots of choices, and, more importantly, lots of *healthy* choices. It also has a relaxed, friendly atmosphere which I appreciated. It's just too bad that we don't have any Jason's in Canada."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place is always packed for lunch. I love their salad bar. Only suggestion would be if they could switch it up maybe a little as I have eaten there for lunch a couple days in a row."}
{"text":"I did like you Jason's Deli, but than my turkey wrap looked like an skinny version of what used to be my turkey wrap.  Why oh why is it so skinny? I finished the whole thing and before I could only eat half of it. For 7 dollars a pop, I would hope to get something a lil more hearty. The wrap itself was very hard to eat and the chips were so salty that I couldn't eat it. Hopefully a second chance in the future will redeem Jason's Deli to 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Jason's Deli used to be one of my favorite lunch spots. I was excited that this one opened up closer to home. We decided to come here on a Sunday afternoon for some lunch. I ordered my favorite, the turkey wrap with NO sprouts. The hubby ordered the pastrami sandwich. (Note: When you are paying, there is hardly any room to sign your credit card receipt...you would think they would have thought it out better, but whatever, I was there for the food.)

We sat down and I started drinking my $2.70 tea, not worth buying it there, but I really wanted it! Our food came and my wrap had sprouts........really? I was a bit cranky after that and the wrap was so measly (the sprout to turkey ratio was like 2:1) that it could barely make a 2 year old full. I think a manager came by and asked if they could remake it for me, but I was already 1/3 of the way done with all the sprouts taken out. The hubby enjoyed his sandwich which could definitely fill someone up. Overall, I was really disappointed in the lack of food for the cost. I probably won't be back for awhile as I don't see it as a good investment for my stomach."}
{"text":"I think Jason's Deli should start offering Himalayan Salt.The Sea Salt is good  but the Himalayan salt is better. And It would be Cozier and Elegant If they put more Plants in it. Other than that their food is really fresh. Thank you"}
{"text":"Jason's deli is the bees knees. I always get the beefeater and the broccoli soup and leave feeling like a king. The best part is the free unlimited ice cream you get while dining in, so bring the kids! Or better yet, just leave them at home and get more for you! 

As for this location itself, it's pretty solid and the food usually comes out pretty quick."}
{"text":"My wife and I both got the sandwich/salad bar combo. We were so thankful. 
It was so delicious. I made a giant, heavy salad. I barely left any on my place. So fresh. So vegan. My wife was also very impressed. This isn't our first time though. First time at this location. Which is nice, clean, and put together. The lady who took our order was kind of bleak, though. She sucked a little life out of me while I was ordering, but I quickly reenergized at that salad bar. 
We were entertained by the managers awkwardly watching and training newbiez. Kudos to them for working at such a kick a$$ place."}
{"text":"I love,love,love this place. They have organic and gluten free items. The all you can eat salad bar is my favorite. The Salmon Sandwich on gluten free bread is incredible and hits the hunger spot. I love that they are a true healthy restaurant. The staff is usually always friendly. I knew someone who worked for Jasons deli for a long time and I can attest that they take pride in making their customers happy, and the place extremely clean. I wish the environment was a little more welcoming and cozy, but since the food is delicious and at the right price, Ill let the environmental feel slide."}
{"text":"Today I ordered lunch for Jason's Deli and the food (Cowboy Sandwich) when delivered very poorly made. I called the store and instead of giving me a song and dance or making excuses the manger said, \" I am so sorry\" and \"that's not how we do thing\" - she sent a new new sandwich along with a lovely desert (strawberry short cake) that was fresh and delicious.
A business is run by people and we sometimes make mistakes.  When that happens it's the mangers/owners responsibility to  step-up and correct the problem in a friendly manner. That is just what this young lady did today. \"Snaps for Jason's Deli management staff\" 
Thanks so much and I'll order again soon."}
{"text":"I had a layover at a hotel on the strip last night, and was craving salad, so I to plan uber (about $6) out here for a fantastic dinner. I had the Manager's Special with half a turkey wrap, a bowl of veggie soup, and a trip to the salad bar. At around $10 it's by far the best deal on the menu. 

Service was attentive, and everything on the salad bar was well stocked, even during the busy dinner hour. The next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the sandwiches, not so much of the salad bar. The sandwiches are stuffed with so much meat that I sometimes have to take half of it home for later. The salad bar is good but doesn't have the variety I'd hope for the price they charge. And the Italian dressing is downright awful IMO. Service is fast and they clean your table off as fast as you finish your plate."}
{"text":"I went here the other night for the first time when I was near the mall, hungry, and wanted to try a new place. My boyfriend got the club sandwich (delicious) and I got the chicken philly melt (not so delicious). I got a soft serve cone while I was waiting (a tiny one, no judging!)

The boy had a brownie for dessert, which he said was delicious.

So overall:

Yay! Club sandwich
Boo! Chicken Philly Wrap thing
Yummy! soft serve and brownie

Oh and our sandwiches came with pickles, which were also tasty. :)

I'd probably try it again but get a different sandwich."}
{"text":"This is a chain deli so I don't expect amazing NY deli sandwiches; but even with a low bar this place struggles to be adequate. I usually judge a deli by the quality of their pastrami sandwich and here it's OK but nothing worth bragging about. This place really loses me when I order soup which are usually over thick bland and mushy. For example, their tomato soup is the texture of loose oatmeal and tastes like warm ketchup; Soup should be made fresh in a deli (even a chain deli) and here it is obvious that all their soups are prepackaged... So sad, oh they do give you free ice cream but before you get too excited know that it's actually ice milk; If you don't know the difference, go ahead and eat here cuz you probably won't know recognize the flaws in their other food offerings."}
{"text":"First time here. Surprised the whole menu isn't listed on the wall. Had to find a paper menu by the register. The menu has something for everyone. Soup, salad, pasta, wraps and sandwiches. The best part is after you finish the meal (or before for those that like dessert first) there is soft serve ice cream. They have mini cones or small cups to help yourself. The ice cream had little flavor and tasted icy. But it was free!!  My husband had the chicken Alfredo lite. Not sure what made it \"lite\". The portion size was perfect, creamy and tasty. It was served hot too!! I had the Mediterranean wrap which I felt was a little thin. They could have added more veggies. Overall not bad for a cheap little lunch for under $20."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite \"fast food\" places ... Lots of organic choices , I believe the salad bar is gluten free. Everything is fresh and pretty healthy if your looking for fast healthy lunch option. I've had a few wraps , all good. The soups are delish :) .. And love the salad bar ! 
  I always get the Manager special 1/2 sandwich with fruit instead of chips and side salad (which is full access to salad bar) and I'm absolutely stuffed ! You can also go back to salad bar as much as you want . Then you get free soft serve yogurt for dessert ! And to top that off they will give u a to go cup for your soda if u want !!"}
{"text":"This review is for on item only. When I like a reastaurant, I always have several favorites that I always order. At Jason's Deli, I go exclusively because it is papa time (cue U can't touch this, by MC Hammer).

They have a couple of potatoes on their menu, fo those that do not want to partake in soups, sanddwiches or their salad bar. Mmm starch.

I always order the spud au broc. Imagine, if you will, a potato the size of an adult's head, bathed in a broccoli cheese soup to keep it nice and moist, cheddar, broccoli bacon and green onions. Need I say more?

This is super fattening, stick to your ribs deliciousness. And I order it every time."}
{"text":"All of the times we've eaten are peak hours yet I've always gotten the order I wanted in a timely manner.   So far not found anything that sets it apart from any other deli of the time but it's consistent and good value for money"}
{"text":"The Papa Joe's is delicious. Great ratio of pesto and veggies tasted super fresh. I think I should have gotten the whole sandwich, but I did the half sandwich, half salad deal. 

The salad bar is pretty cool. Some of the spinach was wilted, so I opted for the spring mix. Good selection of dressings. The cornbread muffin is very little and tasteless. Which kind of sucked because I love cornbread. The quinoa was great, though.

Great sandwich selection and taste."}
{"text":"First time visiting Jason's Deli and we loved it.  The ingredients were quality and the basil pesto on my sandwich was yummy.  Clean store with top notch customer service!  They recognized us as 1st timers and made sure to give us a clear explanation of how things works.  We were thankful because we walked out with yummy free ice cream.

Thanks for a great meal."}
{"text":"Good salad bar, that's true...they have a full variety of salad veggies all fresh and tasty.  They also have soft serve for dessert ... I never had anything else, so I can't comment on the rest of their food."}
{"text":"So here's the breakdown: You order, they make it, you pay for it, choose your salad (good amount of choices but we don't usually get fillers, 'cause we're here for the yummy sandwiches) or soup, or other side, then choose your seat- lots of seating available (booths or tables). Afterward enjoy the free ice cream (also at the bar) -neat huh? 

Nice that there is a lighter menu listing calories (turkey reuben is pretty good at 510 calories and 13 grams of fat). Vegetarian items are denoted with a v on the regular menu. There is also a gluten-free menu (must ask). Sandwiches (specials or build your own- you choose everything), combos (choose full, half, or quarter sandwiches), wraps, soups, salads, potatoes, pasta, sides, fruit, kids menu, and dessert. For years, I've been curious about the muffaletta- meat or veggie, bread with zesty olive mix, antipasti, olive oil, & provolone cheese (featured on the Food Network). I might get it next time. 

Spacious (think tee pee), clean, casual place to get good sandwiches (pretty big too) at a reasonable price. Sometimes I bring home leftovers- eat only half the sandwich, depending on what I get. Bathrooms around the corner. 

It's been a while since we've been here, but we are fans. If the parking situation frustrates you (a complaint of my mil's), you can go to the other location in downtown, in that newer office building- you can see it off the 95 freeway."}
{"text":"We waited in the lobby for our Reuben sandwich this past saturday (it wasn't a long wait). The restaurant floor (square-shaped) is a good size but I think it is a bit smaller than the Maryland Parkway location (used to be our neighborhood one). This one is located in a corner of one of the many restaurant options at Boca Park shopping center (strip mall). If you see Tilly's nearby (juniors clothing, same side as Target), then you're in the right area. 

It is clean, the employees are nice, and there is a large yummy menu here. Most of the items pictured are exactly how you will get your food. Sandwiches are generously filled with meat (comes with chips and a pickle). (Hubby and I split one and had a side of soup at home- we took it to go.) The counter is the left side front of the restaurant. The salad bar includes ice cream (*you can get a half sandwich and the salad bar or you can opt for just the salad bar*; both options are under $9.00 a person) is more towards the right, front of the restaurant. The seating is open and expansive. 

Once inside the car, we had another stop to make, the aroma of the sandwich was very inviting. At home, this sandwich never disappoints. Usually, at casino cafes, the bread is super greasy, so your fingers are covered in grease, and the meat is so-so, or lacking. Not this one, it's meaty, but the bread still has its shape (it's firm and toasted) and it's just a great sandwich overall."}
{"text":"The salad bar is a great deal with fresh ingredients. I like the choices and the price is good. I have tried some sandwiches too and was happy. Until today. The grill cheese and tomato soup combo was nasty. the sandwich had no taste. just blah. The soup was Luke warm and nasty. it had chunks and lumps of I don't know what. I was very disappointed. I ate two bites and gave up. I got to watch my wife eat her salad..... so I guess I will just stick with that. I will have nightmares from that slop."}
{"text":"We found Jason's Deli years ago in Tucson. My wife has a ton of food allergies and somewhere she can get a fresh salad is easy and safe. We used to go to the Chandler mall location. But it closed. We moved to this one. We have been there twice and so far are depressed as heck. Both times we went despite 15 or so tables being open not one was clean. Not one. The kid that cleans moves so slow it is painful to watch. This place is just dirty. Things need wiping down. The ice cream machine was nasty. The salad bar was almost empty. When my wife asked a guy to replace a spoon that got in a milk product by mistake he had a literally eye rolling hissy fit. I miss the old location. This place needs a good cleaning and butt kicking. The employees are sad and sullen. The service is slow and unless you like bussing your own table of other people's dirty dishes good luck finding a place to eat."}
{"text":"I had a coupon and I had just done some shopping errands in that complex, so I decided to stop in for a meal to-go. 

I noticed they had a muffaletta sandwich and you do not see that New Orleans based sandwich very often in these parts so I decided to hop on it. Super friendly and fast in taking my order for to-go until a little issue came up...

While I was ordering, a cantankerous older man came up and told the cashier that he did not want his bread toasted and that his sandwich came toasted anyways. He then proceeded to curse loudly, saying things like \"I CAN'T F*ING EAT THAT TOASTED SHIT\" and grumbling about the service and effing up his order. Here is where it went wrong for me...they totally bent for this guy. A man that is losing his mind over his bread being toasted? And you don't tell him to calm down, or wait his turn, or even kick him out for being disruptive? It is not the staff's fault that this guy barged in on my ordering time and also made me feel uncomfortable but they can make a point with this guy. They stopped attending to my order to help him out. 

As far as my food, the bread was covered in sesame seeds but was slightly stale. A lot of bread to that sandwich. I also tried the tomato basil soup which I cannot complain about. For about $8, I got a quarter of a thick sandwich, some chips, a pickle, and small soup cup. With the weird way things went down the and \"mehness\" of the food, I am not sure I will be hankering to go back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"What a great joint to eat at. the salad bar is one of my favorites by far . the sandwiches and soups are delicious too.  A nice trendy spot for those who wanna eat a bit more healthy.  or sick of chipotle hah"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars*

We had Jason's Deli catered at a work luncheon and I was very impressed with the food. We had a fruit platter, a sandwich tray, and a salad. It was really good, so I decided to try Jason's Deli for lunch. I've been to the Shea location twice now. The first time, I ordered to-go at the counter. They were quick to take my order and had it out to me within 10-15 minutes. (I ordered the Zucchini Grillini - roasted zucchini, muenster, spinach, red onions, tomatoes, olives, red pepper hummus all toasted on whole grain bread. Super delicious! Sandwiches come with a side of chips, fresh fruit, or steamed veggies.) 

The second time, I called in an order for pick-up. (One chicken Caesar salad, one nutty mixed-up salad, and a Zucchini Grillini with a cup of soup.) They said it would be ready in 15 minutes, so I drove down to pick-up the meal. When I arrived, they weren't too busy but my order was not ready. I paid for my food and waited. And waited. And waited some more. Several other customers came in, ordered to go and left before my food was ready. After this happened twice, I asked one of the employees where my food was. It hadn't even been started! Finally, thirty (30!) minutes after paying they said my food should be ready shortly. I waited another 10 minutes before I finally received my food. Needless to say, I was very upset . Food was promised to be ready within 15 minutes of phone order, but wasn't actually ready until an hour later. They did give me some free cookies, and while that was nice, I really would have preferred to have my food ready when promised. (I can get very angry when I am hungry - the \"hangry\" phenomenon.)  Of the three employees I interacted with, only one of them apologized profusely (the employee actually making the sandwiches). That was appreciated as well.

While the food is delicious, I'm torn on returning. From my experience, orders that are placed at the counter to-go are made quickly but phone orders somehow get lost in the shuffle. The location isn't close enough that I can go frequently, so having to wait any extra amount of time pushes the limits of my lunch hour. 

*Food is definitely 4 star, but service/wait time is 3 stars. If I go again, this may tip the scales. We'll see!"}
{"text":"Good Food - More stars if your advertising on local delivery wasn't  (3-Xs common delivery charges). Much to Expensive for Dinner for 2. 
- Please reconsider delivery for two. $25 min order + $8 added charge makes that a $33+ order."}
{"text":"On the 10 freeway heading for Tucson, hungry, pulled into an \"in and out burger\" no room at the inn! standing room only, so we bailed and a block away passed Jason's Deli Wow,it was great, fast and delicious. I have eaten at Cantors deli in West Hollywood and several famous Jewish delis Jasons was an equal."}
{"text":"love this place its like subway on steroids but way better . I dropped by the jasons down the st from Fremont , More expensive then any other sandwich shop but way worth it went there with my bf (boyfriend) and daughter we loved it !! It was a lil loud and busy"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 8 for lunch before leaving Vegas. Although it's spacious, I was disappointed with their menu. They were out of chicken, so we couldn't order half the items. I ordered the spicy seafood gumbo ($5.99) and wasn't impressed. The rice is kind of hard and the flavor was decent. I tried my friend's turkey alfredo, which didn't have much flavor either. The only good part about Jason's Deli is their free ice cream, muffins, crackers, and garlic toast though!"}
{"text":"*****100th review!!! I think!!! LOL!!!!*****

Sooo I've been longing for a delicious deli that doesnt cost an arm and a leg!! My ex suggested here and off we went!

I got the turkey bacon and avocado and the bf got the pastrami (i think!!) we ordered, paid, got our drinks, and some little muffins and bread! We took our seat and I tried all our little goodies... oh my they were delish! My son loved the hard bread and the bf liked the gingerbread. 

The wait wasnt long and our order was already coming out! I seen them and was super pleased! His sandwich was HUGE!! My little got the regular ham sandwich and was happy with it. My sandwich looked AMAZING! I was excited to eat it!! I took a bite and I swear I creamed my panties! It was soooo yummy!!! There was enough of everything in the sandwich, it was perfect! The bread was soooooo yummy as was the spicy mayo! I took a bite of his pastrami and was floored! I never had it before but this was insanely good! I kept stealing his meat that would fall out LOL. 

The service there was super good! They were very attentive and kind, the place was very clean and I seriously had no problems! We went back and I tried another sandwich (I dont remember what) which was also super delish! I also tried the strawberry shortcake and almost melted! If you look at the photos I have one in there! FRESH strawberries, whipped cream, and the softest angel food cake I've ever tried! This dessert was totally ace!

I will totally be back and enjoy the yummies they have here, you should too!!"}
{"text":"Great spot to stop in for a quick bite for lunch or dinner. Friendly service and free ice cream!! They have an all you can eat salad bar and the roast beef sand which taste like cheese burger !! High recommend"}
{"text":"The food is healthy. The service is great!!! Can't complain about anything here except there is no grease ;(. But I you're feeling healthy.... This is the spot!"}
{"text":"This spot is one of my favorite in vegas (or henderson) super tucked away. Get the cali club - lots of good stuff on a croissant."}
{"text":"I've been eating at various Jason's Delis, including this location for years. I don't believe you can find a healthier place to eat. I get the salad bar each time and I don't know of any that can match the worst Jason's Deli salad bar. They're the best by a wide margin. 
    Jason's Deli eliminated MSG, Hydrogenated Oils, food dyes and more from everything they sell years ago or from their inception. I believe it's the place to go to be healthy. Just wish there were more of them."}
{"text":"Great Food, tried this place out on vacation. Clean nice location and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love the all you eat Salad option! Great for eating healthy and choosing what you want. Decently priced and can't go wrong free ice cream!! Lots to choose from - pasta, sandwiches, loaded sweet potato (getting that next time, salad bar, wraps and much more! Will be back for a quick and easy meal!!"}
{"text":"Not managed very well. Every time I visit there are dirty tables and staff is not very organized. Food does not seem to be fresh."}
{"text":"Another great addition to the North Hills Block area and another blast from my past in Columbus! That's right! Another one of my favorites found it's way to Pittsburgh soon after I moved here.  I'm not saying it's me, but I'm happy for whatever the reason may be.  Jason's Deli is a quick and fast eat in or take out joint that offers a number of delicious deli sandwiches ranging from traditional Paninis, Clubs, and Wraps to more specialized Muffalettas (Olive based spreads).  You can even build your own sandwich if you like. They also have a number of salads and an extensive salad bar with plenty of options and a few Pasta dishes.  And don't forget the soup. Then there is everyone's favorite...free ice cream!!!

They option I typically go for is the Manager's Special which is any half sandwich with your choice of chips along with either soup or one trip to the salad bar for about $10 after tax.  You can really load up on the salad bar and the sandwich portions are fairly large so a half will be fine for a nice lunch. I'm a fan of the Pastrami with Swiss and Spicy Mustard and the Ham/Salami Muffaletta. It's all been good so pick what fits your fancy!

The staff is very helpful and attentive. Almost too attentive though. I was greeted as I entered and the menu was explained in detail even though I had been there before. Once I sat and my food was brought out, I was asked by 3 different people if I was doing okay or needed anything.  While I appreciate it, I also just wanted to eat.  All in all, I'd say the trade off was worth it.  Oh, and if you don't want to go in, there is a drive-thru and you can order online."}
{"text":"Overall this deli gets 4 stars from me. The location for me is the only downside. It's a little tricky to get to and isn't the easiest thing you've done all day. The quality of the food and the service deserve 5 stars however. I am always greeted with a smile and the food is super tasty. The salad bar is wonderful with a lot of fresh options. I stick to the California club which has avocado on it - my favorite."}
{"text":"Oh thank god! A deli that delivers and caters. They rescued my butt for a business meeting while in Vegas and their food was very nice. Got the usual sandwiches and salads and cookies and chips.

Prompt and courteous. Exactly what I needed.

Next time, I'm going to have to ask for them to make sure to include utensils so we didn't all have to share the 2 knives and 3 forks for the salad for 10."}
{"text":"They have a limited time thing going on right now with BBQ chicken pizza (not sure how long it's going to last) but let me just say it was amazing.  Probably THE best BBQ Chicken pizza I have ever had.  I have tried other things too, like the tomato basil soup, and many of their sandwiches ... very good, very fresh - every time.  

The 5 stars is for the pizza, but if I were to rate Jason's Deli over all they would get about a 4."}
{"text":"Deli style restaurant located near Stephanie Street in Henderson.

You go up to the counter to order and the waitstaff will bring your food to you. I got the managers special which is the salad bar, half of a sandwich, and chips. The salad bar was decent but could have had more options. I had the muffuletta which was surprisingly delicious. I'm from New Orleans, the home of the muffuletta, and I was not sure this sandwich would be up to par. I loved it. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love Jason's Deli but had to stop coming here due to my order always being wrong. When they do get it right this is a fast fresh healthy alternative! The free ice cream is awesome and you get a free cookie on your next time back."}
{"text":"this place is amazing !!!! I just ordered over 100$ in food and they were awesome !!! there was a lil confusion (only bc I kept calling back to make changes)  but they were so gracious came back fast and I love that !! most places make you wit so long.  The food is absolutely so super good !! I recommend the Club Royal with the Broccoli Cheddar soup OMG !! Prices are perfect for what you get ... Cant say that about most places nowadays !"}
{"text":"First time here and the Ruben is certainly good.  I get my kraft on the side and add it myself.  I'll definately come back, thanks!"}
{"text":"It was ok. I ordered a tuna on rye and their tomato soup. The soup was lukewarm and too acidic. The tuna sandwich was good. Not much you can do to a tuna sandwich. Anyway we'll go back but I think we will wait til next winter and I will ask them to heat it up."}
{"text":"My friend recommended we stop here for our lunch date because she used to come a lot and really liked it.  The menu had lots of variety which was nice, only downside being it was hard to pick just one thing instead of all the ones that looked good.  I decided on the Club Royale because it sounded good and they had a sign up saying it was one of the top customer picks.  My friend went with the Santa Fe Chicken because she'd had it before and really liked it.  I asked if I could have fruit with the sandwich instead of chips and they told me I could but that it would be another $1.59.  That seemed kind of dumb seeing as several of the sandwiches gave the option of chips or fruit for the same price and really I don't see 4 strawberries and 5 pieces of cantaloupe costing $1.59 more than some Ruffles.

The food came out pretty quickly which was good because I was hungry.  I really liked the toasted croissant that my sandwich came on, it added a nice texture and flavor.  There was a ton of meat too, they definitely don't skimp on that which is a good thing.  Overall I liked my sandwich but I wouldn't say it was anything to write home about.  My friend's sandwich however had some issues.  According to her the sandwich used to come with just a regular chicken breast cut in half and served on the bread.  This time it was kind of cut up in chunks and had a strange taste and texture.  The best thing we could come up with was that it tasted like canned chicken.  It had the texture of canned tuna, kind of chalky, really strange.  She couldn't make it through both halves and even asked one of the workers about it to see if that was normal.  He swore it wasn't canned chicken but I've never had chicken cooked any other way that tasted or felt the way this chicken did.

I do like that you get free soft serve at the end of the meal, it was the perfect little refreshing treat on the way out.  I'll definitely try Jason's again, I just won't be ordering anything with chicken in it."}
{"text":"Great food consistently. Just a bit expensive for half orders. But you can always, always, depend on the food to taste great. And the frozen yougurt's free!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for lunch. I really like the atmosphere, and the quick service coupled with good - and huge - sandwiches. I've never tried their salad bar, but they also have really, really good ice cream free for anyone (even if you don't order anything), which is always a fun way to finish off the meal. I like to get the Beefeater, but I like almost everything they have. Occasionally the person at the register seems a little harried or rushed and doesn't stop to explain certain specials or meal deals, which has resulted in me or a friend not getting what they expected. I always try to take it slow when ordering.

The next thing I want to try is one of their baked potatoes!"}
{"text":"What a goofy LV place. Go there with your buddies--not anyone that you want to impress !"}
{"text":"The food is tasty, but if I call one more time and the person that answer messes up my order I may snap."}
{"text":"Huge and impressive. Large eating area and huge food portions!! For under $10 we got a massive baked potato the size of my face and it was quite heavy. The pastrami sandwich was flavorful right down to the pumpernickel in the bread. The salad bar was fresh, clean and even better than some casino salad buffets. Good iced tea and fountain selection.

But wait!!

There is free mini muffins, crackers and relishes.

But wait!!

Free soft serve, vanilla or chocolate or mix flavors. There is cup or cone to hold it. Chocolate syrup, too!!"}
{"text":"I just finished eating lunch at Jason's Deli. I had a Turkey Wrap with fruit and an Oatmeal Walnut cookie. This place has great food. The Turkey Wrap was fresh and delicious. Now, they accidentally gave me a number that didn't match the number on my receipt so I had to check on my order. Anthony the manager was apologetic and quickly brought out my order and gave me a $15 gift card for my next visit. They did a great job taking care of the mistake and the food was great! I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"We will return. We like this place. The food is good, large portion sizes, and reasonably priced. The parking is not so good, but huge parking lot nearby. Place is usually busy. My girlfriend loves their gumbo. I love Louisiana food.  Their muffuletta brings me back to Shreveport. BTW, it is huge. Today I had the roast beef French dip sandwich. It was good. Fresh bread with plenty of melted cheese. I dipped it in the au jus. Yum, Soggy deliciousness! The sandwiches come with a pickle spear and potato chips.  The pickle was crunchy. I don't care for the chips. French fries or salad would have been better.  My girlfriend had the Reuben sandwich. Lots of pastrami. I don't usually like thousand island dressing, sauerkraut, or rye bread. However, It worked and was fabulous. I'm guessing this is their signature sandwich.  Sandwiches cost less than $10 each. Their salad bar is awesome. Best salad bar around. Lots of variety and always fresh. Don't forget to try the muffins on the salad bar. Moist and flavorful. My mother had the French onion soup. I tried. It was okay. I've had better. My father had the club sandwich on croissant. It was okay. I would recommend the roast beef French dip instead. Don't bother with dessert, there won't be room. This is not a \"You've gotta try this\" kind of place, but I'm a fan and will return often."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday night when I had a taste for a sandwhich with some meat to it! I sure am glad I gave Jason's a try. They had a pretty wide selection on their menu from regular deli sandwiches to wraps, and a good sized salad bar. I went with the Royal Club with baked chips and a sweet tea. The club was packed with fresh quality meats, the croissant was nice and flaky, and the chips (Lays I believe) was a nice side. As for the sweet tea...perfect! I am very picky about sweet tea, and this one was just how I like it. The meal came in under $10 and came with the FREE soft serve ice cream! How can you NOT walk away happy from a meal that ends in free ice cream??? :)"}
{"text":"The cashier, Jaime, should teach a master class to others on customer service.  I'm not kidding, this guy is awesome.  The food here is always fresh and tasty, but this review is motivated by Jaime's awesome, customer focused attitude.  He truly understands how to do above and beyond to keep folks coming back. Well done sir."}
{"text":"I've been to Jason's deli twice and its become one of my favorite places to eat for lunch. My personal favorite is the Sante Fe Chicken sandwich; I love the guacamole mixed with the bacon and chicken breast. I also like how they have complimentary soft serve ice cream as well."}
{"text":"The people here are WEIRD and LAZY. I've been to this location twice. my first time visiting was Halloween. No, I was not in costume....but I wore a simple black wing and black lipstick.....Now I may not be Mila Kunis, however I'm far from ugly....This oversize heifer at the counter turned around and screamed! Says I scared her...Bish Please, I just looked at her confused. My second visit was this week....Thursday, my coworker and I went to pickup our lunch around 12PM. There were two people at the registers!!! The woman at the middle register was occupied, the guy next to her was open. This sack of crap looked at us and didn't bother to help us.....wtf! He just stood there looking stupid. He turned around ...walked a few steps, the woman next to him said something, then helped us....To be honest, the guy looked like a Broke rapper.

The food is good. However the people here are Stupid."}
{"text":"Solid place to eat. Had the royale sandwich with chips. It wasn't awesome, but it was good. Had the French onion soup, which was alright."}
{"text":"I liked this spot much more than I expected. Usually if I'm in this area it's because I'm at the Great Greek and I have a Greek craving. I'm glad I finally ventured over to Jason's Deli. 

The employees were friendly and welcoming. While we were there I noticed the employees constantly refilling and cleaning the salad bar area as well as the dining room. The cashier that took our orders was nice and explained how their ordering system worked since we were first timers.

I opted for the 1/2 a sandwich and salad bar trip as my lunch. My sandwich of choice was the Corned Beef because that is usually a good deli option. It was good and I liked the bread for the sandwich. The salad bar was great as well. In addition to a nice variety of vegetables there were many other options. The salad bar also included cottage cheese, fruit, pasta salad, potato salad, crackers, and mini muffins. I really enjoyed the mini muffins. The icing on the cake is that they offer free ice cream with every meal! How cool is that? A nice cone of soft serve always hits the spot.

My lunch choices weren't even the most exciting options offered. They have something to suit every taste. I also love when a restaurant provides nutritional information on their site and menu for easy reference."}
{"text":"We were hesitant to stop in because it never looked like anyone ever went there but decided to try it after all, I'm glad we did! Food was very good and prices were fair. Would definitely recommend people giving it a try - salad bar is always fresh. One of my fav places to go now!"}
{"text":"The kiddo got a certificate for a free meal so I took her one recent Sunday afternoon. I had not been to this location so I wasn't sure what I was in for.

Walked in and it just didn't feel welcoming. Not sure what it is - maybe the layout? Also there was some kind of construction so that didn't help matters. The kid had the mac & cheese kid's meal and I had the salad bar. Even though I gave the cashier the certificate, I had to remind her to remove it from my bill. The mac & cheese arrived and it was really soupy so I was worried. But the kid really liked it and she said it was really creamy so all was good. My salad tasted fine, but the area in and around the salad bar was a mess. There was stuff all over the floor and a few of the salad containers were empty. It just wasn't very appetizing. It was about 2 on Sunday so I'm assuming that there was some kind of lunch rush and maybe it just hadn't been cleaned thoroughly after that. If they do have a rush time, then they should be prepared for it and keep on top of it.

Nothing really makes me want to go back and I'm not sure I will."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for at least a year. We (my wife and I) were coming pretty regularly back then and it just starting going downhill. The music changed, the staff was just weird and the place was becoming progressively dirty. So adios, we were out of there.  
About a week ago, we were in the neighborhood and decided to give it another try... and we were very pleasantly surprised. The place place was very clean, music was suitable for the environment and the staff was perky, informative and attentive. It is obvious this place had some major changes happen and all for the better. I highly recommend this location and hope they can maintain the changes and momentum, because there are not a lot of places I like to eat. 
Only criticism I could provide is the pasta salads seemed to have too much oil dressing. Keep up the good work, nice to see a place stepping it up for a change."}
{"text":"This place is good in my book!!!! Nice portions on the sandwiches, and not to mention they have cheesecake that is simply AMAZING!!!!! Don't sleep on JASON'S DELI, they definitely are handling some big business over here!"}
{"text":"Excellent food at A GREAT VALUE! I love their salad bar. Every sandwich & baked potato I have tried is delicious. Straight ahead food for an excellent value makes this my go-to Deli! The fun part is the ice cream machine to add something cold & sweet after a wonderful meal. I highly recommend Jason's Deli. And the service is even better than the food!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim with the wifey, 

She has been plenty of times, however this was my first. Driving by I thought this was another Jimmy John's but it is actually a casual sit down deli with a wide variety of options. 

I had the ruben which  was very tasty, and satisfied my ruben craving without having to caugh up 15 bucks at Chompies. Wife got the salad bar which had a TON of options to satisfy ones healthy needs....plus little cornbread bites

+++++ Free soft serve with every meal! 

I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Eastside @JasonsDeliLV on Maryland Pkwy-Deli sandwiches,soups and salad bar.

A little pricy but damn good. Everything is made-to-order and they have a wide selection of vegan options to boot.

With so many sandwich options in the Valley Jasons is good but for my $ not so memorable.

I enjoyed the CHILI and the POT ROAST MELT!"}
{"text":"I have only had the salad bar with a small soup which costs about 9 bucks.   Very good deal.... very good salad bar... by the time the soup cup comes, i am almost full on very good salad bar items.... come for the salad bar!!!!!! best place!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Why has Yelp made no stars not an option yet? I am writing this review as I'm sitting in this establishment's parking lot. My mother, whom is inside because I could not even speak to their manager, is returning and getting her money back for my MOLD INVESTED turkey wrap AND the rest of our order that we didn't even touch. How could those items be fresh?! Never again will I spend my money at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Our team came here in between games for a local tournament. I know how hard it is to accommodate such a large group and they did it with ease!

Nothing we ordered was anything less than delicious. I ordered the Chicken Club Wrapini and was very surprised at how good it was.  I would order the fresh fruit as the side because nothing else seemed to go along with the meal. 

This location was very large and excellent for groups as well as a delicious and fresh salad bar was perfect to help yourself if you didn't want to wait. 

There are a lot of great and easy places around but it was my first time at Jason's and I am glad I branched out and tried something new."}
{"text":"We went to Jason's Deli Saturday evening.  The place had some customers, I'd say about 20-25% capacity.  There were 2 people ahead of us in line to order.  There was only one cashier with 3 potential registers.  Appeared to be a little short staffed.  It took about 10 minutes until our order was placed.

My wife had the salad bar and I had a chicken avocado sandwich.  It arrived at our table in good time.  The meal was good.  

The staff was friendly and checked on us.  The restaurant was clean.  Would go again if in the area."}
{"text":"Jason's deli was delicious! The fruit side was so fresh and tasty! They allowed us to bring our assistance dog inside. They were very polite and friendly. I will be coming to lunch again! The California club was great!"}
{"text":"This place is a good manager away from being the best deli in town. Sometimes you get a hot sandwich on a cold roll, sometimes you get a great sandwich on very average bread, sometimes the lettuce & tomato are after thoughts... I guess what I'm trying to say is the ingredients are top shelf but the details are missed. If the manager ate there he/she would know what I mean and correct it. Great service, very clean and free ice cream!!! :)"}
{"text":"Very fresh, love the hummus. Best banana pudding anywhere!!! The people who clear away plates are super courteous as well as the cashiers. Highly recommend Jason's deli in Henderson, NV"}
{"text":"The food was OK.  I ordered the Reuben Sandwich and one of the guys that worked there was making such a big thing about how big the sandwich was and how I would probably have to take half home.  I was so disappointed when it came out.  The sandwich was not as big as he tried to make it seem,."}
{"text":"This place has killer sandwiches.  Everyone I know who eats here, loves it.  Free soft serve ice cream cones after your sandwich?  What?  You'd have to be a player hater to think that sucked.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because they don't offer fries.  Fries would make this place addicting.  I get that it's a sandwich joint, and chips reign supreme, but it feels like so much more.  I just hit this place up in back to back days and would continue going if I was still in Vegas."}
{"text":"I work upstairs and it's a shame Jason's is not better because the entire floor talks about how bad the food is.  The bread is very dry and the sandwiches lack flavor.  Also, they always get your order wrong. If something else opened up close by, they would be out of business. I'm forced to eat here once a week and have tried everything on their menu. You think they would have to get something right, right??? Not! Too bad.  Our office caters a lot too.  Please, Jason's, step it up for the whole building's sake!!!!!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong. Clean and fresh.  It's not the most amazing sandwich or salad you ever had but for a fast food joint it is above average.  The Turkey Ruben is excellent and the fruit is fresh."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Jason's in quite some time, but usually when I do, I do the salad bar.  Pile your plate with fresh veggies to your hearts content (looks like they also have added some extras like Caprese Salad and some other pasta salads as toppings).  I usually hit the bar about two times, and then, when I have a great level of a false sense of eating healthy... hit the soft-serve machine.

This location at the EpiCenter is convenient for uptown workers to grab a salad bar lunch - just be choosy on when to head on over since it can get a little crazy.  I've seen the line LITERALLY go out the door during the peak lunch rush.

If salad is not your thang, they have soup/sandwich combos and even some pasta dishes (made to order).  They will give you a number and the nice server folks will bring it to your table.

The dining room layout has a ton of tables and booths... they are located on the corner of the EpiCenter so they have a bunch of tables next to windows (which you find out quickly that they are pretty popular) especially if you sit in a cubicle with no windows all day long.  If you can't spare a second, you can get your order to go - This location also caters a lot of lunch meetings so you will see the many carts with soft coolers on them for when they transport the goods."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's like an upgraded and WAY healthier version of a school cafeteria where the people behind the counter actually want to serve you. The food is fresh, tasted delicious and has a multitude of options. We both ordered sandwiches, I had fruit, he had chips. Both delicious and the fruit was probably one of the most delicious and fresh fruit I've ever had. We would eat here again in a heart beat."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with the food at this deli.  Coming from Los Angeles, I expected a real-deal, big, delicious corned beef sandwich. What a got was not good.  The corned beef was salty, fatty and entirely sliced way too thin. Was nothing like what I expected.  To put it into perspective, they didn't even have any cole slaw!  Not a good deli. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I love Jason's deli! I especially enjoyed the chicken, cheddar cheese, pico de gallo, stuffed potato!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! I especially like the salmon sandwich! I have always had good customer service from the employees here. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I love this deli! Even though the restaurant is a national chain, the food is always fresh, reasonably priced, and consistently delicious. 

My favs are the Nutty Mixed Up-Salad, Club Sandwich, and the Tomato Basil soup. I love ending my meals with their complimentary soft serve ice cream. Kudos to whoever came up with that idea."}
{"text":"My coworker and I come here whenever we're feeling like something lighter for lunch.  My favorite things to order are the Deli Club or the California Club.  I get the half sandwich, half soup and pair it with the tortilla soup.  So tasty.  Plus, there are free gingerbread and corn muffins in the salad bar.  We are never disappointed when we eat here.  The tables are a little close for comfort (it takes a grace I lack to navigate between the chairs).  If you're looking for a good soup/salad/sandwich, you should eat here.  Just save room for the complimentary soft serve."}
{"text":"This location seems to have solved its sticky table problem and perhaps they took my suggestion to hire more cashiers.  However they ran out of cones and cups for the free ice cream. I had to ask 3 times for cups. One person I asked suggested I use the one left that had obviously been handled and dropped on the floor by another customer. Really?  After a 10-minute wait the magic cups appeared and I was able to partake of the free ice cream.  I still recommend driving the extra miles to the location at Ray and the 10.  They are way more efficient."}
{"text":"Always a good choice when you are in a hurry! Great selection of soups, salads and sandwich's. Had the club royale and the organic vegetable soup and both were delicious!!!! And always friendly faces."}
{"text":"This is a typical corporate deli with a typical menu.  However, the staff was friendly and the place was clean.  It efficiently moved a lunch crowd and we did not stand in line very long.  The food was quick to our tables and everything was quite nice.  If you need a quick place for lunch, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go in the evening for normal eats.  They treat you like they have 5 stars.  From our greeting at the door, to the help at the register to order and information about all the nice extras they offer you we felt taken care of.  We had people come by the table several times to check on whether we needed re-fills, to clear our plates, or to just check on us.  I would say it was overkill, but I actually appreciate that the staff is requested to and pleasantly take the extra steps to make sure we're taken care of.  They are way more welcoming and seemingly genuinely interested in making your experience a good one and to appreciate your patronage.  That's way better than Flemings or any of the other restaurants in the area.  Some of them would do better to follow Jason's example in staff professionalism & courtesy."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli is a great place to go before a movie at Shea 14. They have a ton of delicious options so it's a great place to go with a group. They mostly sell a variety of sandwiches, salads, HUGE potatoes, desserts, and much more. Now back to those potatoes I think they may be chemically altered, but they taste great. If you are really hungry get one, but they are big enough to share. I stick to the Plain Jane potato which comes with butter, sour cream, bacon, and chives. Another great thing about Jason's Deli is the free frozen yogurt. Yup after your meal enjoy some fro-yo on them! What more could I ask for!"}
{"text":"Biggest baked potato I've ever seen....and it was delicious.  Turkey sandwich was extremely plain and boring but the bp made up for it.  I recommend just for that."}
{"text":"I'll start with being positive ...they make a very tasty Meatballa Po'boy! It was so good I was sorry I ordered only half of the sandwich in favor of their half sandwich deal. The Sandwich Deal that I ordered came with a cup of soup, baked chips and a pickle spear for $8.29. I tried the Spicy Seafood Gumbo which was really too salty for me. I had three bites and I couldn't continue because it was that salty! I ordered an Organic Pomegranate Melon Tea that I thought would compliment the meal but my hopes fell flat. The tea was very bland I couldn't taste the pomegranate at all and the melon taste was barely there. The ordering was a bit confusing too because in front of carry out there are registers but they had me go all the way down to the other side of the deli to be rung up. I just think they should re invent their layout and the price of the special to stay competitive. I received a similar special at Heidi's Brooklyn Deli for only 5.99 and it was delicious.  I really wanted to like this place because it's close to home but most of the choices I made for my meal didn't deliver what I was expecting."}
{"text":"Love this place! People are friendly and a ton of low carb options!! Clean, good, quick! One of my fav lunch places! Sometimes they go too fast and serve up less than perfect food. My avocado was mostly brown and the bacon was 80% fat."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli is perfectly average for a quick lunch.  They have a large menu with sandwiches, wraps, salads, and soups. The food is average quality, but the prices are reasonable. The service is friendly. I recently tried a southwest chick wrap and was underwhelmed. The chicken chunks were too large and dried out. The wrap was overpowered by jalapenos and the sauce was runny.  But I've had the Reuben here and it was pretty good.  I like to stop by Jason's for a quick lunch, but there are many, many better deli's out there."}
{"text":"amazinggggg service, great management, and now have customer for as long as i live by this location, thanks for the fresh food!"}
{"text":"I stopped into Jason's Deli for a pastrami sandwich my only complaint was I needed a much larger portion. Not that the portion was not large I just love a good pastrami sandwich. Their sandwich is outstanding, made fresh and hot. I have to stay away or I would be in there every other day. They do a good job and the prices are very reasonable. They have a number of locations around town so the rest is up to you. I had chips and salsa with a ice tea. Unlimited refills on beverages and  you can get yourself your fill of ice cream."}
{"text":"Finally found my sandwich at Jason's Deli.  I've been here a few times but always find myself comparing it to Miracle Mile but its just not.  I always like the salad bar but I am not a salad bar kind of guy unless its the side to my meal.  I ordered the Po'boys pastrami melt and it comes on a sub style roll with Russian dressing, mmmmmy mouth is watering just talking about it.  I like the fresh food here and there gluten free bread for the kids, most things here are organic and very fresh looking.  Kids can have free frozen yogurt when they are done.  I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Don't recommend the drive thru. Takes way too long! Drive thru'a are meant to be quick."}
{"text":"I gave this place an extra star because on both occasions that I went to this restaurant the cashiers were super nice. But that's about it both times I have eaten at the salad bar it was a mess and most of the items were low or had other food products in them which was pretty displeasing. I understand that any restaurant is going to get busy and need to re stock but thus was a pathetic showing both times which was sad. Then when you look at the choices on the salad bar itself it's just so plain and all of the pasta dishes that you have to choose from just don't look very pleasing in their own right they all look like they were in a bag of some sort soaking in juices then just dumped out into a canister. I like that they give a 10% military discount but it's worthless if you don't want to eat what they offer I hope they update their salad bar for at least a few more fresh items and possibly get a employee to better stock it during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Truth is that it's not a New York deli but the salad bar is really good, my friend loved her stuffed potato(plain Jane potato isn't so plain: sour cream scallions bacon and cheddar- looked great); turkey sandwich was piled high, and my corned beef sandwich was tasty. Free ice cream??? That seals the deal! I'd go back"}
{"text":"Stoked they have quinoa now!  Very clean big and friendly staff.  If they mess something up they fix it. Gotta respect good customer service.  I come here when I'm getting my tires changed or a car wash and get lunch. Always happy when I do."}
{"text":"I had to take away the 5th star.  Reasons:
1) the giant potato chunk incident.  I got potato salad with chunks larger than a golf ball, that is way too large.  Raw in the center.  Lack of consistency in preparation in a chain store violates my expectations.
2) no more soda water dispensing.  You used to get bubbles in ordinary water, now only flat water from the lemonade dispenser is available.
3) grumpy management.  The rank and file employees all smile and seem generally cheerful.  On multiple occasions I observed frowning, grimacing, and public berating of employees.  I don't want to eat somewhere when the people in charge don't look happy to be there.

\"Why do the managers always look so pissed off here?  This would never be allowed at Disney\" - my lunch date.  Came in a few days later and everybody looked much happier.

I really enjoy the soups here as much as the sandwiches, you should make sure you try plenty of both.  The cream based soups are very very rich."}
{"text":"Eh, not impressed. My family and I have been here twice now and we probably won't return....Some items we've tried:
Chicken noodle soup - SUPER concentrated. I needed to put ice cubes in it to cool AND water it down. After the ice cubes my children ate a little bit

Chili - it's like hot dog chili. Not good at all!! I took it back to the cashier and he has ask permission to switch it out. We had literally dipped 2 crackers in the bowl. Not even a spoonful worth was missing. Yuck. 

Muffeletta- I regret not taking a picture of the aftermath of this. We got the whole turkey sandwich. When it came to the table there was like a 1/4 lb of meat to 2lbs of olive tapenade!! It was down right gross. After my husband opened the top and bottom of his sandwich up to let all the olive mixture fall out his whole plate was COVERED. I understand olives, celery, and pepperocinis are cheaper than turkey but REALLY. I love olives and I still let alot fall out without eating the remnants. 

Chicken Caesar salad- Standard. Safe. If someone drags you here (by your hair) order this. The chicken was warm and the dressing was good. 

I know the lure of all you can eat salad might sound good but screw this place and it's $7.99 salad bar and pay the same at the salad buffet that has unlimited soup, pasta, potatoes, and salad! 

Please save your money and go else where."}
{"text":"This was my first time to this location and it was amazing as always.  It gets REALLY crowded at lunch time and even though the wait to order may take longer then normal the rest of the place runs better then any Jason's Deli I have been too in this city.

The workers are very friendly and helpful, they work hard and at the busiest part of the day, they keep the tables moving.  When you are finished and leave, your table is cleared and cleaned for the next person almost immediately.

I have never seen a Jason's Deli this well managed and ran.  There is not much they can do about the wait to order as they have everyone available working on taking orders and getting them out. The wait after you order for your food is FAR less then the amount of time to order but again the location of this place only allows them to do the best they can and I guarantee you they are doing the best they can and then some.

If you are in the downtown area, you cannot go wrong with this place.  The selection is varied where you can get something different if you find yourself here often.  Either way, the food is worth the trip and the friendliness of the staff is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite deli's but for this location, the third Thursday of each month there is a group of about 100 that comes in around 11:30, so be prepared for the crowd.  I don't know what the group is that meets there but they are regulars.  As for the food, AMAZING chicken soup and the sandwich you see in the picture is the type of sandwich you will find in front of you.  

I have never had a bad meal at any location and you get FREE ice cream, as much as you want, can you beat that????

Of course I had a cup of soup and a sandwich, I did not go for the ice cream this time, I know what is wrong with me.  I did take half of my sandwich home because eat was just way too much food but I was very happy with my selection.  I am a creature of habit though, I love the New York Yankee because it has corned beef and pastrami, one of the only places in town I have found that has it on the menu without having to ask them to make it for you AND there is no place in town that makes a sandwich like this place does.

I love this place and I will return some day, I just cannot tell you which day because I love to eat and there are just so many places to eat....."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Everything I've tried here has made my tummy happy.  The staff is always so nice and friendly.  I love taking friends and family to Jasons for a great meal and soft serve."}
{"text":"I don't think there's a better place for a salad bar than Jason's deli. It's located downtown so it's an easy place to go to for lunch. When you get the salad bar you get everything all the fresh veggies the Redpepper hummis the free corn muffins the chocolate mousse the free ice cream at the end of your meal seriously what could be better?"}
{"text":"I live very close to Jason's Deli. For a long time, I ate there at least once a week. Last time I visited Jason's Deli, I ordered a chicken salad wrap with tomato and found a metal staple in my food. I have not been back since..."}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick, healthy and delicious lunch. Great menu and the favorite sandwiches are made picture perfect!! The salad bar is fresh crisp and good selection of toppings.  Free soft serve is a great southern hospitality touch.  I ordered the Rubin which is as good as any Jewish deli I had yet!"}
{"text":"I stopped in after shopping to grab some food to take home.  I had no idea what I was walking into. It was nice to see a clean dining area! I walked up to the counter with trepidation. The menu board listed Local Favorites as well as manager's specials. I grabbed a paper menu and looked it over. So many more options than Panera!
I went with the Broccoli Cheddar soup and the Amy-O Turkey Sandwich.
The soup was still hot when i got home and really tasty. The sandwich was full of meat, the bun was toasted but not burnt and the veggies were fresh and crispy.
There is an app available for easy fast ordering and this location had a drive through."}
{"text":"So Far, So Good. I only come here during lunch. The first few times, I got food to go just because the eat in line was pretty long. I took several family members to this place and they really loved the sandwiches. 

After reading, other reviews of this place. I do agree with the cramped seating. There's no privacy while your eating. 

The sandwiches are really good. It's like eating at Paradise Bakery but cheaper. Kind of, anyway. The fruit is sometimes sweet, sometimes tart and not enough to finish the fruit dip that comes with it. The croissant bread is a bit to crunchy, flaky for me. 

If my lunch hour permits, I will return for the sandwiches and all you can eat ice cream.  Opps, did I not mention it? Well, if your dining in free ice cream."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Love the food and the free ice cream! I would suggest the New York Yankee, but get it on a roll! I would also say come hungry as the portions are big and for some reason it's hard to know when to stop!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Employees are so friendly! Place is clean food is good. Love the pasta salad!"}
{"text":"The food was \"okay\" at best. This was my first visit to Jason's Deli and I wasn't impressed. It's like a disappointing version of Sweet Tomatoes and had I know the deli food was going to be this plain and underwhelming I would've taken my \"deli craving\" somewhere else... Lesson learned. Won't be making a return trip here anytime soon"}
{"text":"I love sandwiches from deli style places. Soup is great as well. 

I recently tried the muffaleta and a pastrami and turkey sandwich and was delicious. Definetely going to go back and try something new. I went for lunch on a weekday and from the crowd inside had to be good food. I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"The banh mi is a lie (Cool points if you know the reference :) ). Now to be fair, should you be really expecting a true banh mi sandwich at an American style deli? No, but still, don't advertise your sandwich as an iconic staple of Vietnamese fast food if there isn't any component at all that resembles it! It's like calling a dish spaghetti and meatballs using penne pasta with alfredo sauce! The sandwich itself tasted good at least. It was a toasted round ciabatta bread sandwich with \"Asian slaw\", some pickled veggie (Onion I think), and deli turkey meat.

I primarily had the salad bar which was a little over $8. It was decent and had a lot of different toppings, dressings, and pre-made salads such as potato salad and the aforementioned \"Asian slaw\". They also offer small cornbread and gingerbread muffins currently. 

There is a fountain drink counter behind the salad bar with Coke products and a few iced teas.

Service was fast and friendly.

The bathroom was disgusting and looked like no one had cleaned it in weeks. There were a lot of unsightly stains (Stains that are only there if no one has scrubbed the toilets in some time), gray detritus on the floor, and dust on the toilets.

Mixed feelings on this one. I generally have had good experiences with other Jason's Delis, but not sure if I'd go back to this one."}
{"text":"I've never dined in here, but I have gotten takeout a few times since this location is convenient for me. I had no idea you could get the salad bar to go and went all out when I found out I could! Everything on the salad bar looks fresh and yummy. 

I stuff my to go box with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, cheese, pasta salad, bean salad, boiled eggs, cottage cheese, croutons and more. I'm not ashamed to say I have a hard time closing it! One time a rude employee was absolutely horrified by how much I stuffed in the box and loudly told me it was way too much food. There's no shame in my game when it comes to getting multiple meals out of takeout. ;) It's well worth going just for the salad bar and I should go more often. 

I got the turkey sandwich once with a side salad bar to go, and while it was still good, I prefer the full salad bar. I got the baked potato with cheese once and I was shocked at how large the portion was - it's definitely not a Wendy's baked potato!

Make sure to get some free ice cream before you leave! Yum, now I'm craving that salad bar."}
{"text":"J and I have gone to this location now twice in the last week (having usually gone to the Ray location).  Our birthing classes started last Thursday night and we decided to head to Jason's for dinner before class last week.  We decided to go back again yesterday evening before class. 

HUGE potatoes.  Big enough that we split it.  I get a 1 trip salad bowl and J got a half sandwich.  Word to the wise though on the potatoes.  Ask for the toppings, if you're getting a Plane Jane, on the side.  They load it up with butter, cheese, and sour cream.  We ordered all of our stuff on the side last night. 

Friendly and helpful staff.  Not sure if we'll be going back next Thursday or not before class again.  But I'm pretty sure that we will.  

Oh and did I mention the free yogurt?!  Add a little granola and some dried fruit on top....YUM!!   :)"}
{"text":"I needed an early breakfast catering order delivered to our office.  Mike arrived on time and with a smile  :-)  He set up all the items and made our table look so nice.  He did a great job... thanks Mike!  :-)"}
{"text":"*** I think this location does a fine job if you eat your food there or take it to go. *** 

However: if you use this location for business catering - it's a whole different story.  They usually miss at least one thing from the order and they tend to arrive late.  I'm not sure how this is actually providing \"catering\" service since getting the order * correct and on time * are the two main points to hit when you're making your money from business catering sales.  

I'm never one to want \"money off\" or \"a freebie\".  We're willing to pay for the services we use, but we do actually expect to get the service you're selling after we pay full price for it.  

So when the manager offered to comp our hour late delivery yesterday, I told him I didn't want the money back, I wanted him to tell me how I can feel confident to use them again for my office catering because in all honesty, I need to be able to use this Jason's Deli because of their wide variety and healthy options.  It's truly not about the money for me- it's about having faith that they can actually handle the business that they advertise for and that I want to give them.  When I said these words to the general manager, Josh, he just blinked at me and actually said \"I'm not sure what you mean by that...\"  I could tell by his facial expression that my words weren't at all sinking in and that he simply didn't care to the level that I did, so I accepted his offer to refund the order and asked for something in writing that showed the order had in fact been comped.  

It's a sad state when I have money to spend, I chose a place of business based on their own advertisements of what they can accomplish and I'm still left unsatisfied at the end.  Fail."}
{"text":"There food is really good but I definitely suggest dining in instead of picking up or delivery. Delivery usually takes a really long time and when you pick up they often forget the dressings, utensils, etc. would give this place a better review because they have good food but the service kind of ruins it"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches and the most irresistible muffins YET! 
Can't be beat!"}
{"text":"We came to have a quick lunch on saturday afternoon and although they were not that many people our order took over 20 minutes to come out out of the kitchen. There was only one person preparing the food and all of the other employees were just talking. There were plenty if employees to be able to provide a good service, however that was not the case. It cannot believe it takes over 20 minutes to prepare 2 sandwiches. The manager was on site, but he didn't seem to care too much! I think their is a huge management issue. If you see that you cook needs help, there should b addition staff helping each other! I dont think i'm coming back, there are plenty of good delis in here to waste your time in here!"}
{"text":"Wow!  This was the best experience I have had at a Jason's Deli.  The food was great and healthy.  And the service was very good.  It was like-\"Is this the same place I have been before?\".  I think it was quiet due to the heat and being a holiday weekend.  I highly recommend the California Club with fruit.  Even the bread was good."}
{"text":"I love how this location has the nicest staff ever! They smile and always want to talk to you! The food is pretty good, but I've had better. The sandwiches are okay but can be a little flavorless, depending what you get! I'd stick with Subway or Port of subs for the best sandwiches!"}
{"text":"On the door it stated it was open at 10 a.m. I arrived at 1010 and the doors were still locked. A clerk let me In. I was one of the first people there along with another couple. This was my first time at Jason's Deli. I saw several workers standing behind the counter but no one explained to me how it worked; I had asked how do I ordered my food. I then ordered the all you can eat salad bar Plus a cup of soup. Now remember there is really no one in the restaurant  and it was dead. It took 15 minutes to get my cup of soup while all the workers we're standing on the back preparing other food. When I got the soup, the soup was spilled all over the Bowl. Some of the lettuce was wilted. I wasn't impressed with the salad bar. None of the things in the salad bar was filled up to the top. The chocolate syrup was out. I was disappointed in the whole overall experience. This place lacked attention to detail. I wish I took pictures to prove how sloppy everything was. They need to fire the manager!!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was interesting. I ordered a pasta dish and asked for pine nuts to be added and it came out with almonds. then they tried to tell me they were pine nuts... i don't think so. It really wasn't a big deal, I'm sure it would have been fine with almonds, but the general manager, Evan, came over anyway. He said the pine nuts are only in a pesto sauce. Apparently the chick who took my order had no clue what the difference between pine nuts and almonds were and told them to put \"the sliced nuts\" in my pasta. The GM remade my pasta and even brought my boyfriend and me and some cookies on the house. My boyfriend's sandwich was really good too, it was the chicken pesto panini."}
{"text":"We are here twice this weekend because the food is so good.  A friend recommended and I checked the yelp reviews to confirm.  We especially liked the pastrami and the salad bar."}
{"text":"We used Jason's Deli for 2 days of breakfast catering for a corporate retreat held at the UNLV campus.

Not only was the ordering process online extremely easy - including making substitutions -- but the service, food and selection was awesome. 

Since our group flew in from all over the country I was extremely happy that the delivery driver Joey knew exactly where our room was on campus and was waiting for me outside the room.


He quickly set out the food and after touching base on the plan for the following morning I felt confident that Day 2 would even go smoother. 

Day 2 resulted in a last minuted classroom change but it was no problem for Jason's Deli--Joey knew exactly where to unload and delivery was super fast.

Our group of over 45 was extremely satisfied with the food selection and I was super happy that breakfast both days was so stress free.

Jason's Deli is perfect for any corporate catering event and with a delivery driver like Joey expect smooth service.

Thanks for making everything so easy and I hope to use you all again!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Jason's Deli! A friend and I were looking for a place with healthy food (hello endless salad bar), where we could sit and talk for a few hours and be left alone. We found it! The salads were good, water was cold, and outdoor patio was comfortable."}
{"text":"Went there Easter Saturday, ordered the French onion soup the bowl was only 1/2 full. This place is great, but it seem that the worker are half hearted."}
{"text":"A Coworker recommended Jason's Deli. I just happened to see one when I was by Barnes & Noble. Why not try it.

  IMO they are kind of pricey. $9 something for a BLT with potato chips and soda is a couple dollars short of a full service restaurant. For a $7 BLT, at least give a choice of fries. Nearly $8 for the salad bar is not a bargain, when you could have all you can eat salad at any buffet. Even the worst of the worst buffets cannot ruin salad (well maybe a few)

  I rate the quality of the BLT, served on a double layer of wheat bread as high. The baked Lays is the same quality of the baked Lays I eat at home.

 This Jason's Deli is enormous. I appreciated that it was easy to find a table and that there were not people on top of me.

   I will pass over boasting over Jason's Deli to coworkers. There are better restaurants. My first impression is that Jason's Deli is good, yet nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch that I wish I went to more often. Plenty of good items on the menu and you can grab some ice cream from the machine on the way out. Gets packed so need to get there early or order ahead of time to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always come here for lunch, when I'm in the area. They have a nice fresh salad bar. I come for the clubs and fresh fruit. But anything else I get is always good. Never really to crowded and love the customer service!"}
{"text":"This Jason's Deli is bomb! I come here a lot for lunch and it hasn't let me down yet. The Chicken Club salad is my favorite. Dine in and takeout are both great options here but either way make sure you grab a soft serve cone!! Unlimited ice cream?? Gets me every  time.. Love it here and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Never been to a Jason's Deli before so me and my boyfriend decided to check it out since We live pretty close. As soon as We walked in We were greeted by a girl at a register. I told her it was our first time thinking she might suggest things but instead she just threw a menu in front of us and started to talk with a coworker. What caught my eye was the half and half deal. I decided to go with the Rueben sandwich and French onion soup and my boyfriend got the chili with a turkey sandwich and we decided to share one of those potato things. The Rueben was delicious, piled high with corned beef. The French onion though was extremely disappointing, more disgusting actually. The flavor was so bland that I had to add salt, and that didn't even help. I would definitely go back for another sandwich but not the soup. My boyfriend did enjoy his meal though, but the potato on the other hand was dry, way too dry. Maybe the need to find another way to cook it or something.

Only reason I gave 2 stars was because of the Rueben sandwich and the guy who was going around busing the tables. He kept checking up on us very frequently."}
{"text":"I have been to various Jason's Deli.

I have always liked their sandwiches, salad bar, and soups.  

We are in Vegas for a wedding and decided to go to Jason's Deli for a quick bit to eat, it was getting late and we were hungry.  I am not sure what time the majority of Jason's Delis close, but this one closes at 9 PM.  We got there about 8:50.  I figure like most restaurants they will let us stay and eat even when they have \"locked\" the doors.  Which is kind of surprising they will close at 10, they aren't far off the Strip, and Vegas doesn't sleep...right?!  

We grabbed 5 bowls of soup, and a salad bar.  I chose the Seafood Gumbo.  It was ok, nothing compared to gumbo from N'awlins, but it was ok.  Not sure if it was the time or if this is how they always prepare it, but it was microwaved.  It wasn't hot(temperature), but it was sufficiently warm.  I also got the Salad bar, they were cleaning it up before 9 PM, so I had to be fast to get a few things.  I was a little disappointed, I know they want to be done with work and roll out ASAP, but at least wait until a customer is finished!  If they wanted to clean it up, they should have let me know so I wouldn't have ordered the Salad bar!    

For that reason alone I am only rating this location 3 stars.  Poor customer relations.  The food is still good, and I will visit another Jason's, just hopefully not 10 minutes before they close!"}
{"text":"This is BY FAR the best sandwich place in the faster food arena.

The California club is amazing.  I cant stray away from it.  It's 690 calories, but feels like you are eating so much more.  Bacon, turkey, Guac, cheese, on a croissant is mouth watering.  You can get a half sandwich with salad bar or soup with chips or get the full sandwich with a side.  I have had the chips, veggies, and fruit cup with delicious fruit dip.  

Did I mention they have free ice cream?! 

The prices are right and the service is great at this location!  

5 stars for price, quality, and variety."}
{"text":"A simple option when it comes to dining in the Pineville area. I don't frequent it a lot, but when I do they always are busy. I never really have any issues. They have quite the process to get food out quick.

If salads are your thing, they have a heck of a salad bar spread!

Don't forget! Free dessert on your way out... They have an ice cream machine with cups and cones. 

I don't know who Jason is, but he has a pretty good deli."}
{"text":"While Jason's has a pretty extensive menu I come here for one thing and one thing only. Muffalettas. I can't just take off for New Orleans, but thanks to Jason's I can grab a Muffaletta to go any time I start craving one and be thinking of my Bourbon Street memories in no time. 

This particular location is relatively clean, service is friendly and once you find a parking space they move you through pretty fast."}
{"text":"How hard is it to fix a veggie Muffaletta? Obviously its harder than I thought. 2x they messed up my order...not good. Compared to Jason's Deli locations in other states, this one in Henderson just doesn't seem to be up to snuff. With so many other choices of places to eat within a 5 min drive, you can do better by going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Although I wished that they had more vegan options the little options they had were just as good. All you can eat salad is never a complaint here. I'm in salad heaven and also the lean sweet potato was so delicious as well."}
{"text":"Great service and food! Cashier was very helpful and sweet. Food came out at a decent time and it was delicious. You can't forget the free ice cream!"}
{"text":"The food here is good but they can be packed! The staff has always been friendly and courteous. The salad bar has lots of options for you and there is also free ice cream!! I love getting their chicken wraps with chips and salsa. I've tried several of their soups and they have all been good. My favorite is the seafood gumbo."}
{"text":"I brought a group of people for lunch to Jason's at Arroyo Crossing location. I am only giving them 4 stars because apparently they are not used to groups coming in. I called but was told they did not take reservations so when we did arrive they were very friendly but didn't seem quite sure how to seat us. The food was fresh and plentiful. The salad bar is my favorite and always good. The sandwiches looked huge and delicious. We had several vegetarians and dieters so Jason's can fill the bill for them. The management was great. The people behind the counter were a little unfriendly. The tables are too small for groups. We were in each others plates almost but over all a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"I order from this Jason's Deli all the time, it's always good service and great food, yesterday I decided to order me and my Fiancé sown dinner and have it delivered. 
I placed my order and waited for it to arrive, the person who delivered it was extremely rude, had a very bad attitude and when I told her \"Thank You\" she replied with \"mhm\" and when I told her to have a good day she replied with \"Yep\". That is not good customer service, I was extremely disappointed with how I was treated. Normally this would've been a 5 Star review but this experience with this super unfriendly delivery driver was unacceptable to me. 

I get everyone has bad days, but there's no reason to take it to work, and take it out on customers spending their hard earned money."}
{"text":"I've never dined-in at JD, but I've had many a boxed lunch on trips where we had them cater meals for us. The trip to u of eh for the game last night is an example of such. I ordered a turkey sammy on white and what's what I got. They put SO MUCH meat on these sandwiches it should be sinful. Unfortunately, the sandwich is just meat, tomatoes, and lettuce (mayo and mustard included in the box), but the bread is so moist that it's really okay. It's probably one of the best, basic turkey sandwiches I could ask for. Plus they're chips and cookies are really good. Judging from the reviews I should probably stop in one of these days...."}
{"text":"I really loved the wheat bread my turkey sandwich came on. A friend brought me lunch while I was at the hospital with my sister and this really hit the spot. The fresh bread was the highlight but I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli is always solid. You have to try the French Onion Soup w/ their awesome salad bar. I also enjoy their \"Wrapinis\" and the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich(SO GOOD!) Everything is FRESH! 

The staff at this particular Jason's Deli is always fast and friendly and the restaurant is very clean! 

Great, quick lunch spot!!"}
{"text":"Truly impressive...Fantastic deli, classic Chicago decor, Large sandwiches, fresh ingredients, generous salad bar, good value. Will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"I was invited here for a lunch date with a friend. I ordered the Amy Turkey-O sandwich. I was intrigued by the avocado but the sandwich just did not deliver. The best option is to choose the salad bar. They have lots of options. The best part about Jason's deli is the free ice cream."}
{"text":"Good fresh salad bar. Healthy.  Good value. Crowded & noisy on Sunday. But still a good value."}
{"text":"Salad bar is fresh and really  good. Their garlic toast & hummus is awesome. So is the chocolate pudding with chocolate chips! Lots of sunflower seeds, walnuts & mixes for toppings. Like the touch screen ordering when there is a long line.  Management is super friendly."}
{"text":"After my co worker raved about this place, I made it a point to check it out. 
I honestly was a bit confused when I first went in, because there is a touchpad to order food. So I wasn't sure if was to order there only. Nonetheless, duh you can order at the touchpad station or just go right up and order at counter.
I got the salmon salad. And I must say, I loved it. The salmon was very fresh, as well as the greens. The salmon was cut in chunks--different for me because I am used to a whole salmon on top. But nonetheless was still good
I did order it to go. Also, it is a very nice portion. The person who took my order was very kind and patient with me. I was having a lot of dazed and confused  moments trying to figure out what I wanted. So I appreciate that!
I really do hope this business does very well, and does not get overlooked.
I look forward to checking it out again, and next time i think I will try a panini and soup."}
{"text":"I only came in here twice, there are ALOT of sandwich shops in this area 
I tried the chicken dumplings and had a heart attack
So many amazing options
It's a fairly large place 
Very clean 
Local clientele 
Easy to get service and a clean spot to sit in

I've taken it home the second time 
They had chili which my husband loved 

This is a good place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"This place is ok...a bit pricey for what you get...i got the pastrami which i figured it  would be great nice and leand lean like at a real deli...but was disappointed it was fatty and tough and it was cold...had better pastrami at a fast food burger joint. The vegetarian French Onion soup was real good...salads look good. Now the person who took our order not very friendly as the attitudes of some of the other staff...like i said salad and soups look good but as for me i probably wont be back"}
{"text":"Jason's Deli was very delicious. I'm amazed at how big this place was on the inside. The food was very fresh, the employees were very fast and professional, and the prices were reasonable. Yumm!"}
{"text":"Having secured a $5 off birthday coupon, I decided to try Jason's Deli and their delicious-sounding chef salad (loaded with cheddar cheese, kalamata olives, grape tomatoes, eggs, ham, and turkey). I decided not to order online because the website informed me that my order wouldn't be ready for an hour (what??) but when I called, the employee informed me that they would have my food ready in 20 minutes.

When I got there, I snacked on the free muffins at the end of the salad bar while I waited for my order (there's also soft serve ice cream available). My order was ready promptly within the 20 minute waiting period and off I went.

This is where the 2 star review comes in. The salad was DISGUSTING. All of the lettuce was half-frozen; the cheese tasted like it had been left out for a couple of hours; and all of the meat was VERY salty and inedible. After a few bites I settled on fishing out the eggs and grape tomatoes and washing it all down with lots of water. 

My only positive about this experience was the fact that I didn't pay full price."}
{"text":"Love Jason's.  I am huge on soup, salad and sandwiches, so they got me right from the get go!  Their chicken pot pit soup is so flavorful!  And, I don't even like chicken pot pie as a rule of thumb.  Free ice cream = an added bonus.  Their baked potatoes are enormous.  Favorite sandwich so far is the chicago club.  Salad bar is decent too."}
{"text":"Ordered a catered lunch today for a large meeting. 

Ordering online was quick and easy. There are a lot of different options so it was easy to find menu items which everyone would enjoy. The website was easy to navigate. 

The food showed up on time. The person who delivered set everything up nicely. 

Food was great. Everything was fresh. The veggie tray and fruit platter were both fresh. 

The group enjoyed the lunch. Great presentation on the catering trays and great tasting food."}
{"text":"Sitting here with a sad face....normally have lunch here for a change came in for dinner and it is a totally different experience. The soup is good, Pastrami is over cooked and dry...my sons chicken nuggets were meaty but dry, the cantaloupe was not ripe and was disappointed that there were just 9 small pieces of fruit included with his meal. The saving grace was the soft serve ice cream....do not think I will be back for dinner again"}
{"text":"I like this place for dinner.  Seems most come to pick up take-out so in my experience it's not usually all that busy at dinner time.  Service is generally good, although sometimes they seem to have a problem keeping tables cleared.  

Love their Nutsy Mixed-Up Salad w/ Chicken - yummmmo!  The only problem is I like it so much I almost never order anything else here.  And a full salad makes 2 meals for me.   Get a go-box and I'm ready for lunch the next day.

They have a nice salad bar that is generally well-stocked and fresh if you are a salad bar lover.  

Free soft serve ice cream is realllllly soft but such a nice cool treat to finish off your meal.

5/14/14 - Returned after a long absence, hubby was disappointed last visit to learn that the Jersey Joe sandwich has been discontinued.  Anyway, we dropped in again this week for dinner and found a pleasant remodeled surprise.  This location has been redecorated, updated and modernized.  I like the new B&W local photography, very nice changes.  Menu seems pretty much the same and consistent.  I still like topping off my meal with a free soft-serve cone - no matter how full I am.  Yes, it's still really soft so eat fast or wear it."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli is a great place for an amazing sandwich!! Highly recommended and the staff is always nice and give great descriptions of the menu."}
{"text":"I received a promotional email this morning announcing their new Salmon Salad. As I hadn't packed lunch for the day, I clicked their site and was excited to see they actually deliver uptown which is extremely helpful to those of us that want a semi-healthy lunch, but don't have the time to fight the long lines up anywhere uptown during lunchtime. I ordered the salmon salad,  a ham sandwich with chips for my boss, and a Rueben with no sides for my coworker. Nothing extravagant. I received an email at 12:36 saying to allow 30 minutes for my order to arrive, so we expected to have our lunch by 1pm, give or take a few minutes. My order did not arrive until1:40pm and every single item was super cold. Needless to say my salmon salad looked absolutely NOTHING like the wonderful picture on the email they sent me to market it. it literally had 1 cherry tomato on it. So, after waiting over an hour for our lunch to arrive, and having a Hangry Boss and coworker,  I am served ice cold (straight from the fridge) salmon on a few greens and 1 cherry tomato? My boss' ham sandwich-- cold. My coworkers Rueben- cold. $40 for a lunch that took too long without a legitimate reason(they couldn't even argue that they were cooking the salmon fresh, and I don't think it takes an hour to make a hams sandwich nor a Reuben and ride a bike a block to deliver it). Won't do this again, lesson learned."}
{"text":"It was just OK.
Nothing special.
Only gave it 3 stars because they gave my son a job.

Maybe I got the wrong sandwich.  I suppose I can try it again and see what happens."}
{"text":"Can't believe I didn't find this place sooner. On top of the great sandwiches, free ice cream and free unlimited GARLIC BREADDDDDD"}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch place. I get the all you can eat salad bar and it's delicious."}
{"text":"These little jerks have the worst online ordering system. Good luck getting orders from anyone online."}
{"text":"Why did I love this place so much?
+ Free softserve icecream
+ Loads of organic produce and bread
+ No high fructose corn syrup (unless you get a soda)
+ Excellent spicey tortilla soup
+ Quick, healthy and delicious
+ My bf got the potatoe and I couldn't believe the monster! It was 4 lbs!

It sounds like this place has improved since earlier reviews. I would go back anytime for lunch, it was great. And kids eat free on Sunday's (so avoid it like the plauge and go another day ;)"}
{"text":"My job always orders from Jason's Deli and whatever I get always ends up being good. They have healthy options which I love and a large menu. Whatever mood you're in you'll find something tasty. I look forward to trying out the location closer to home."}
{"text":"I like Jason's Deli. They have pretty chipper employees, a clean establishment, a nice array of soups, sandwiches and salads and free ice cream and muffins. Really, what's not to like? 

I try to eat healthy-ish 80-90% of the time, so I was perusing the menu looking for a tasty wrap or sandwich. The Ranchero wrap stood out in all its spicy glory: Organic wheat wrap with natural, grilled chicken breast, cheddar, jalapeños, pico de gallo, Southwest spices, ranch dressing. Served with organic blue corn tortilla chips and salsa for $6.99. 

Was this wrap tasty? Yes. Should I have, perhaps, asked for the ranch on the side? Yes...because thanks to Jason's very well put together website and easily accessible nutrition information, this wrap bombed me with 680 calories, 28 grams of fat and more than 2,000 grams of sodium. Damn Gina. 

Now, I'm not blaming this establishment for serving highly caloric items...it happens. I like Jason's. I just have to be a bit more careful of what I order!"}
{"text":"We like the food here, except don't get the Mediterranean Wrap--that was not so good; the pastrami and the club sandwiches are great; my reason for the 2 stars is that the service is less than desirable. If you eat in, you will have a better experience probably--I did on 2 occasions. However, on 3 occasions they have gotten it wrong when we did take out each time, and note that the place was not busy. One time they never let us know our food was ready--we waited quite a long time and then checked and lo and behold they said they called our name, but the place was empty, so not sure whose name they called or how loud they called it. The 2nd and 3rd time they got the order wrong, and did not really offer an apology or to make it up to us."}
{"text":"Thoroughly impressed with Jason's deli! Actually ended up there because the place we were trying to go to across the way had closed down. So glad we got to eat here instead! 

 Different feeling for a deli here. Family friendly environment without screaming children or the greasy stench of fast food! 

 I ordered the half sandwich and soup. The club royale was huge and I could hardly finish it! Being from Louisiana, I was very critical of the spicy seafood gumbo going in but it really passed the test! There wasn't much \"seafood\" in it, more like a few small shrimp but it had a great consistency and was spicy enough that it was burning this southern girls mouth! 

 All the food tasted very fresh - I didn't feel like I was at subway or the like. The service was good - had a couple of people stop by the table and check on us. 

 To top it all off - you apparently get a little cone of ice cream free with any meal purchase! Who can beat that? 

 Over all terrific experience! Left very full and happy - will absolutely be back and will be recommending Jason's Deli!"}
{"text":"I eat here for lunch about twice a week. The menu is so varied it's hard to get tired of the place. I recommend the manager's special which is a cup of soup and any half of sandwhich. My Fav is the New York Yankee but I get mine grilled. A half a yankee is more than enough, it is a robust NY deli style sandwhich packed high with pastrami and corned beef. My favorite soup is the tortilla which is awesome but on the right cold day the chili all the way works too."}
{"text":"Friendly service is just the beginning. The food is good, I have not been disappointed yet. Try the chicken chili."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the staff is ALWAYS so friendly! I love how quick I can go in and out despite it being a restaurant setting. I've tried a lot of different foods on their menu and there is not one I do not like. 

My favorite dish has got to be the Zucchini Pasta. Excellent portion sizes. If you get the sandwiches their deli meat tastes SO fresh. There's also a salad bar and an ice cream machine for dessert. I often get vanilla ice cream and pour root beer soda in it."}
{"text":"Just delt with one of your drivers @7:00 am 4845 traffic. He entered the highway crossing three lanes of traffic forcing me to brake excessively to avoid his slower vehicle."}
{"text":"First stumble on the joint when I was looking for restaurants on Yelp. We came in almost closing time and they were nice enough to take our orders of dine in. So I was help by the manager of Jason deli(forgot his name) but from San Diego said his name tag I ordered a wild salmon sandwich and chicken Alfredo and they were awsome. They also gave us free ice cream. Anyway the staffs was so nice and pleasant although it's past closing time, i'lll definitely be back here again. Thank you Jason Deli ' staffs for an awesome experience at your service."}
{"text":"Me and soup have a thing. And this place has a laundry list of yummy bowls of goodness. Don't tell the other soups, but chicken pot pie is my fav.

This location is always rocking at lunchtime. I love to get take out from here. I live just down the road, so eating lunch in my pajamas on the couch sounds way more appealing than eating in real clothes inside a restaurant.

Deal alert: you can get the salad bar to go and a bowl of soup for $10. It's enough for two meals. Ingredients and veggies are always fresh. You can add a protein for a little bit more. They give you a big plastic salad container, plus two smaller round ones. I think you're supposed to put dressing in one of them... but why would you do that when you could put pudding in it instead?!

They have do it yourself kiosks where you can place your order and pay without actually having to interact with a human. Well, unless you can't figure out why your credit card won't swipe... and a worker has to walk over to explain you're running it upside down.... face palm.

Soups, salads, sandwiches, baked potatoes... plentiful lunch options to please anyone. There's even a soft serve ice cream machine.

Nice workers. Clean restaurant. They do delivery and catering as well. Convenient option for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I loved Jason's Deli!  The one in Charlotte on David Cox Rd. and the one in Birkdale Village in Huntersville.  When I learned that a new one would be coming closer  to home, on Concord Mills Blvd, I was cautiously optimistic.  Everything on the \"Bully\" which is what my family calls Concord Mills Boulevard get mad busy, and sometimes, the quality can't  suffer.

Service was good at first.  Food was fresh, sandwiches and salads were beautifully made, soups were thick and hearty...everything was in the money.  And then the inevitable slide.  We'd place an order for pickup.  On to the convenient drive thru, which I love, because I have limited mobility, and pick up our food. The sandwiches got sloppy, the soups were thin,  and the stuffed potatoes...were empty.  Due to the fact that we'd picked up at the drive thru, I didn't want to make a big deal of it, so I just left it alone. Sadly, service just kinda hovered near the \"meh\" mark until a couple of weeks ago.  It was then that I knew neither I nor any of my friends and family would eat at Jason's Deli.

I went to the drive thru and ordered a taco salad with chicken chili and a large coke.  The meal was close to $11.00. I pulled around to pay and waited for my salad.  I can't say that it took an inordinately long time to prepare the salad, but it was longer than I expected.  Nevertheless, I got my order and drove home.

When the salad was opened, we found a bunch of what looked like iceberg lettuce butts (literally) the end of the lettuce OR strictly the rib of a very light head of romaine lettuce.  No leaves.  Not only that, there were bits of plastic, perhaps the underwear from the butts of the lettuce dispersed throughout the salad.  It was inedible. I called the store and spoke with the manager Matt and told him my issue. His response was for me to bring it back, and they'd make me another salad fresh. I knew I wouldn't be able to make the drive back, so I refused. There was no offer made of a gift card for a future return.  Nothing.  Nada.  He hurried off the phone. The end!

I called JD's corporate office and explained my experience. The representative advised that the district manger would be contacting me in a couple of days. It's been nearly two weeks, still, nothing.

It's sad how an experience with one store can sour the appeal for all of the stores in my area. But every brick and mortar is representative of the company. They don't care.  Got it.  There are plenty of Panera Breads around."}
{"text":"Always super GOOD! Salad bar and sandwiches are some of the best around! When we're staying at our Laughlin home we drive all the way to Henderson just to dine here for lunch. Then we end up staying a few days."}
{"text":"Courteous staff! Clean and well lit. Great place for a quick lunch. Good sandwiches and a nice variety of sides, as well as, complimentary soft serve ice cream and brownies."}
{"text":"Free ice cream with your meal!!

The staff here is like really nice. Very nice. I can't believe how nice they are.
It's a to-go type joint, but with quality service.
I love coming here I go at least once a month. 
The soups and sandwiches are made fresh to order which is a plus.

They also have a selection of the salad bar that consists of free munchies for entree purchases. It's like a raisin muffin and corn bread muffin. 


They have a nice menu, if you ask they will explain it to you so its simple.
They have a manager's special, which lets you select soup, salad or sandwich. You get to choose two. And it includes chips or a side of fruit. 

The soups here are so good. The price is way better than Panera. If you were to look throughout the entire arroyo plaza, this and sammys pizza wins! 

Get off your butt and go eat guy! It's amazing.


If you're in a hurry, order in advance! They have a separate entrance for to-go orders. 
Quicker to the register and quicker out that door. 

Cheddar broccoli soup.. Is a must! 



Enjoy your meal! :)"}
{"text":"They really get 4.5 stars.  I am a bit of a food snob/healthy and organic - gluten free, dairy free.. so I love the gluten free bread, organic soup, and veggie options. While some of those veggies and at the salad bar are canned, it's still better than most are offering and maybe that's best at your resonable price point... so you get points for trying and giving options to healthy eaters so i can still feel like I had an old fashioned deli sandwich in a healthier way:)  
I also like a socially conscious business and I love that you hire many great people with different capabilities - all are doing a great job!"}
{"text":"First time here and will absolutely return. I had the Royale Croissant with broccoli cheddar soup. YUM YUM!!!!!!! Salad bar is rad and they also have pasta. Fantastic service here."}
{"text":"I work uptown nearby and come here fairly frequently (usually before 11:45 since it is pretty busy for lunchtime). I can say I've never had a problem here - the staff and management are very friendly and courteous, and my food usually arrives in good time. I've never gotten a bad meal at this location here either - can't say it's ever blown my mind, but it's always been satisfying, which is par for franchises. Great location and great lunch spot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"One of my fav stops in LV. So much to order and try...I love their french onion soup. Love that you can order half a sandwich. Also, free cornbread muffins and ice cream cones!!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go from here a few weeks ago. The Irish potato soup was the most delicious item of choice, but unfortunately wasn't situated well in the bag and leaked out. The chicken panini was okay, but lacked some flavor. Still, for the decent prices and free ice cream, we decided to give it a go for a late afternoon lunch this weekend.

I'm a pretty easy-going diner, but this was choice was a mistake.

Walking in, the floor and tables were a mess. There were two children screaming (which I realize isn't the deli's fault, but didn't improve the experience).  Two of their recommended items, the Irish potato soup and baked chips, were gone. I ordered a tuna melt with French onion soup and my friend ordered the chicken sandwich. We dined in and found ourselves sitting at a frigid table under a huge vent. I went for a diet coke only to find that was also gone and only dispensing seltzer water.

Tables were sticky. The noise level was a little irritating. When our food arrived I was more than disappointed.  The tuna melt was not even close to an actual melt, it was a cold tuna sandwich with stale bread, plastic cheese, and cold meat. The soup didn't impress either - it was watery, and instead of nicely pieced bread or croutons, it had one large piece of soggy bread in the middle of stringy onions. The manager \"melted\" the sandwich again at request, only to return with the same sandwich within three minutes, seemingly just microwaved as neither the bread nor meat was properly cooked. Thankfully, she did refund the sandwich price. My boyfriend said his chicken sandwich was average enough with plenty of room for improvement.

I left easily enough to hit a different venue, but couldn't escape the smell of fry salt ALL over my coat and even in my hair. Sitting under the vent must've been an even bigger mistake than I'd anticipated. I literally went home and washed my hair.  Next time, hit Potbelly's or Panera for somewhat healthier food options and nicer dine-in experiences."}
{"text":"This place I originally found in Florida while out there for work and when I saw that they brought them to Nevada I almost immediately drove to get a sandwich. These folks make every sandwich fresh with high-quality meats and fresh potato chips. The menu has changed since I was in Florida but the Reuben that I had was absolutely off the charts. Fresh meat and sauerkraut. Glad I have another Vegas go to when I'm hungry during my visits."}
{"text":"I live about 20 mins away , but they deliver ;) .I've ordered from here about 5 or 6 times. My food is still fresh when it arrives , the drivers are friendly, and you can't beat the price.  
   I've gone To the deli twice, it's clean and they are busy ,  two good signs. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wonderful sandwiches, good soup and an amazing salad bar.

Need I write more?

Oh alright, but only because you like to read my crazy quips.

I get the Ruben but prefer mustard over thousand island dressing.  I like corned beef with thousand and pastrami with mustard (just for your knowledge).

The salad bar is amazing.  Different types of lettuce plus spinach.  The normal round of vegetables, beans and fruit. Plus, green olives, I really like green olives.  Many dressings to choose from.

I could swim in their soups, but I wont; for many reasons.  They are thick and flavorful. Hot out of the kettle, no semi-warm soup here.

Itls a sandwich place so do not expect linen table clothes and suited servers.  You pay, get a number and find you're own place to hunker down.  I'm cool with that.

And the best quip for last: FREE ice cream cone.

I don't believe there is anything more that needs to be said."}
{"text":"Solid deli.  Nice people, food is good not great."}
{"text":"Normally not a fan of delis since I'm not keen on sandwiches but this place was an exception. The variety of meals alone scored four stars and the food was mighty tasty! Pretty sure I'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"This place is headed to the PITS! On a not so busy Friday afternoon there 5 tables around me waiting to be cleaned but employees and managers are standing around the register talking and laughing..(for the past 25 minutes).  If you have time to lean you have time to clean. The guy who brought our food said he was a newly promoted manager, and I immediately thought to myself \" you won't be for long.\"  He was the main one who stood behind the counter laughing loudly and chatting it up with employees while customers ate in dirty sorrundings. 
Jason's Deli was never like this which is why my family and I enjoyed coming here.  Please get campetant employees back to your Pinevillle location."}
{"text":"My family loves the muffalettas. They are so delicious and reminds me of New Orleans. We usually get two full size for about 12.99 each (each one fills us up with some for lunches the neext day). Comes with two bags of chips and pickles. YOU GOTTA TRY IT. I always call my order in and head over, no wait and they are usually ready when i get there."}
{"text":"The best tasting food around.  Great salad bar with tons of organic choices. Perfect place to eat!!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and customer service is spot on!  Clean environment!  I enjoyed my sweet potato stuffed with beef brisket, BBQ sauce, red onion, and cheese!  Love the free ice cream also!"}
{"text":"Wild salmon-wich is the bomb..bread is some sort of crab flavored biscuit"}
{"text":"I have been to this Jason's on several occcasions in my day.  It's kind of in a weird location, and basically a pain in the butt to get too.  its immediately before the I-10, so if you miss the drive way, you have to go totally out of your way to turn around.

Anyways, I came here to eat since I was to lazy to cook anything for dinner.  They have huge deli sized portions, and one sandwich easily feeds two people.  My mom and I split a sandwich when we ate at the one on the west side, many moons ago.

Anyways, I think their menu selection is decent.  Large enough to please most peoples pallets, but from personal experience, I don't think thier menus anything to throw a stick at.

It seems that most of Jason's Deli's are set up the same.  Large self seating area, with booths and tables.  They have a carry out section, along with a dine in section.  

I studied the menu and placed my order.  The girl behind the counter did a decent job, but what frustrated me was the order delivery/pick up.  While I was waiting for my order, my mom called.  I decided to take the call at a table, and I ended up finding out that my food had been ready.  

I guess it was a little confusing since I had a number on my table that they would just walk it out.  I guess I had to pick it up myself.  I didn't like that!  I was obviously on the phone, and the guy saw this.  He called me over, and I had to manuver this heavy tray while on my cell.  Usually, I've had the food walked out!

Anyways, I ended up dining in. I had half the sandwich wrapped, and ate half at the resturant with a tasty ceaser salad.

This place is great for kids, family, friends, dates etc. Just a note, the portions here are GINORMOUS."}
{"text":"This review is solely a (Yelp) resume builder... 

Let's be honest... there is nothing unique and/or amazing about a deli food chain. Let's see, I ordered a Turkey BLT. Tasted just the same as the Turkey BLT I ordered from Panera, oh and the one I ordered from McAlisters Deli."}
{"text":"After getting rained out at the Arabian Horse show at Westworld, I was very very hungry.   I was going to eat at the horse show, but since it was so muddy and wet, I didn't stay as long as I had anticipated.

After leaving the show, I drove down scottsdale road debating what I should eat.  Something filling, not fast food, that wasn't going to drain my pocketbook.  I then spotted Jasons Deli and immediately pulled in! I've been to their locations before.  I used to frequent the location in Awatukee, but have yet to have been to this one before.

The menus for them are all the same (obviously) at all their locations.  You order at the counter, pay, and then they bring the food out to you.

I got the half sandwich with a salad.  Gigantic sanwiches, and salad was self serve from the salad bar.  I had wanted a Cesar Salad, and the guy told me I could make it myself at the bar, but when I went to the salad bar, there wasn't any Cesar Salad stuff!  BUMMER!  Thats okay, I survived with minimal crying involved.

Food here is good, ordering is a bit awkward for me though.  Prices are steep, but considering how much food you get, I guess the value is there.  I love a good deli sandwich, and this place seemed to hit the spot.

Not a true authentic deli, but good enough when you need some hearty food.  I would return again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at Jason's Deli in a few years, and I felt like doing something different this afternoon for lunch, so I swung in here.  I went with the Yankee half sandwich, French onion soup and a drink, which was quite tasty.  I also got free ice cream at the end! I don't remember them having free ice cream the last time I was here, but dang, that was good.

Overall the place is good.  It's not a traditional Jewish Deli since they don't offer a lot of Jewish foods, such as Gefilte fish, borscht or anything like that.  The sandwiches are big and tasty, plenty of items to choose from and they seem to have a decent salad bar as well.

Overall I liked it here. Not a half bad place.  I will say the staff was nice and friendly, but I got kind of annoyed after a while.  Why do you ask? Well for starters, I'm sick to death of being asked to \"fill out a survey\" when I'm placing my order to \"tell you how I'm doing  UM NO.  I yelp about it, and that's my input.  I'm not signing up for your stupid survey online to win a free cookie/gift card/dumb thing because you want my feedback.  QUIT ASKING.

Secondly, I got asked no less then 5 times by 3 different staff members how my meal was going.  Please, quit interrupting me every 5 minutes to see how the last bite of food was.  IT GETS OLD.  Once or twice?  SURE.  5 times?  STOP IT ALREADY YOUR BEING ANNOYING. I want to sit here, read my book and enjoy the simple respite of having a meal cooked by someone else.  I don't need half the staff circulating hovering over me and my food to make sure that every single bite was scrumptious. I DEDUCTED ONE STAR FOR THIS ANNOYING PESKY BEHAVIOR.  Like I said, if something's wrong, I'll tell you. But more importantly, I don't need to be asked 5+ times if it's going well.

Overall, I like it here. Standard fare deli with a decent reliable menu with good pricing."}
{"text":"This place is great i love coming here and getting the beef eater ! Best sandwhich i think. Food is pretty pricey for what you get, not to impressed with the price. Staff is pretty friendly except some of the girls talk in a real high pitch i cant understand them but good service. I wouldnt recommed this for take out unless your willing to have something wrong on your order or are willing to wait an hour for a sandwhich and have others be served before you, that came after you. But great food!"}
{"text":"Their salads are fantastic. I highly recommend the tortilla soup and French onion soup. Even their pastas are amazing for a deli. And how do you say no to the free ice cream afterwards yum yum yum"}
{"text":"An amazing spot with a great staff.

From the AYCE salad bar full of fresh foods, to the piled-high sandwiches, and lastly the free ice cream and muffins for all, Jasons has been my go-to spot since stumbling into one in Texas 15 years ago."}
{"text":"The all you can eat salad bar brought me into Jason's Deli. I was looking for a place near the cycling course that had a salad bar. Not a lot of places have salad bars during the day. Some of the supper clubs do; but that's usually during dinner. I found that the salad bar had most of the items that I normally would put on a salad. I don't feel as if I was missing anything significant on my greens. They had a selection of pasta salads, bean salad, cole slaw and potato salad too. Chocolate mousse and banana pudding were a couple of the sweet choices near the end of the salad bar. There's a separate area that included breads, crackers and numerous salad bar toppings. After hitting the salad bar, I needed to finish up my meal with their all you can eat soft serve ice cream! Your choice of chocolate, vanilla or swirl. You can eat the ice cream in a dish or cone. I went with chocolate ice cream with almond bits on top."}
{"text":"I love this place! I admit I always get the same thing but this location has never let me down-the food is always great  and the people are always beyond polite. Whether it has been to go or we eat there they're always fast and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"This is a really great and convenient place to eat, especially if you're attending UNLV. They offer a variety of items, such as baked potatoes, pasta, and sandwiches. If you dine in here, you have complimentary access to their self-serve salad bar, which also has pasta salads, garlic bread, and cornbread. This is also a great place to dine in with family members, especially if you bring your little youngsters with you since there's also a complimentary soft-serve ice cream available for them when dining in. In addition, the customer service is exceptional and they're very quick in bringing your food over (between 5-10 minutes)."}
{"text":"Wow have I missed Jason's Deli! I visited while in town visiting and had a great experience. This deli style fast food establishment has lots of delicious and fresh options to meet everyone's needs and tastes. 

There is a number of sandwich and soup options as well as my favorite, their all you can eat salad bar. The salad bar had lettuce, spring mix, and spinach as well as a number of fresh veggies, toppings, and cold salad options like pasta and bean salads. My only complaint here is that the protein options were limited to beans, eggs, and bacon, which limited what you could add. Other than that I found every other topping option great. There is also fresh bread, mini muffins, and soft serve ice cream for you to enjoy. 

Overall Jason's Deli is a solid chain option for lunch."}
{"text":"Not as good as some other locations I've been to.  Sodas were flat.  Ice cream was chalky.   But sandwiches were good"}
{"text":"I really like the concept of this place. There are an assortment of sandwiches and soups along with an extensive salad bar. Mix and match, it's all good. Prices are reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"They need to learn the difference between VEGAN VS VEGETARIAN  no dairy mean no cheese  lame that's why they get 1 star"}
{"text":"Great food with several organic options and gluten free bread!"}
{"text":"I am so glad that this Jason's Deli is so close to where we live. Our favorite lunch is a trip to Jason's for their salad bar. Lot's of choices and soft ice cream machine for a treat at the end! We also like their soups and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Jason's deli has some really delicious gems on their menu. My personal favorite is the Mediterranean wrap and the chicken pot pie soup. The staff is always friendly and helpful. If you're looking for delicious food and out of this world staff look no further than Jason's deli."}
{"text":"The food may be good, do not trust the online group ordering.  I used them in December, and called to check since it was my first time.  Despite email confirmations, the order was incorrect, but they delivered on time.  In January tried again and despite five calls, the order was two hours late.  In one of the calls, they had the wrong name and address.  Not sure if it is the software or the employees, but never again for me,"}
{"text":"I don't ask for much. When I order a sandwich, I ask for no onions or tomatoes, depending on what the item includes. 9 times out of 10, it arrives with the offending fruit/vegetable in its full glory. I politely remind the cashier of my order, get a polite apology and the food is remade, sometimes just by scraping off whatever I had originally requested not to get in the first place. Tomatoes leave \"guts\" all over the sandwich when removed, but I hate to waste food or be rude so I suffer in silence. I'm tired of this dance; the food is ok if you get what you ordered, but I never do, so I think I'm done for a while."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, nice staff and average atmosphere.  The sandwiches are good sized, although my bf got the beefeater and said the roast beef was a little bland.  The Au Jus was great though.  The salad bar looked good and fresh.  The free ice cream at the end hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Always get delicious deli food here.  Subs are excellent, lots to choose from, and fast & friendly service.  The is very affordable too.  My favorite sub here is the Italian Cruz Po' Boy.  It is not on the menu anymore, it was on there old menu, but is still available. =)"}
{"text":"The staff at Jason's Deli is, quite simply, outstanding.  I wouldn't hesitate to call them the most friendly, attentive and courteous restaurant staff ever.  They have really set themselves apart from other establishments in their cheerful level of service.  The food is also superb.  I recommend the Zucchini Grillini sandwich, which is as fun to eat as it is to say.  It is layers of zucchini with tomatoes, red onions, black olives and Russian dressing which is the perfect blend of complements on this sandwich.  Enjoy it with the blue corn tortilla chips or a side of fresh fruit.  Don't forget the ice cream machine for your free ice cream afterward.  They have recently redecorated the dining room to give it a more coffeehouse-style feel and it is nice."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment.

I wanted a real deli sandwich (not Subway).  I thought I'd give this place a try.  $10.00 got me a 6\" meatball sub on a white bun, Lay's potato chips, and a pickle spear, with a regular soda.  The sub was not one bit better than Subway.  This was a complete waste of my time and money.  I could have had the same exact thing (sans the pickle), and chosen my own chips from a variety.  
They have a lot of food on the menu; I have no idea how the soups, salads, etc. are.  All I know is that I couldn't even find a list of the types of bread they offer on the menu.  This place is hard to navigate, and the food quality is not worth the trouble.

UPDATE:  Went back for lunch (at a friend's request) on Tuesday (11/1).  I had the chicken club salad and a cup of the Southwestern Chicken Chili.  Both were quite good.  My bill:  $14.90.  I'll up the rating to 2 stars, as the food is OK (not great), but it is WAY overpriced."}
{"text":"Jason's is a good, solid lunch choice. They have a HUGE selection of sandwiches/soups/salads, and the salad bar, which has the usual stuff, and some surprising stuff as well (hummus, anyone? holla!).  Good sandwiches, decent portions, all around good pick.

That being said - if you're coming for a weekday lunch, you MUST arrive between 11:20-11:35 to avoid an out-the-door line.  I'm sure it moves pretty quickly, but if you are with a group of 3 or 4 and want to find a seat without stalking someone that is aaaaalmost finished with that last bite of pickle, you gotta get there early."}
{"text":"After an exhausting day a simple trip tp Jason's Deli David Cox Rd. would be the event that shifted the rest of my evening in a positive and less tiring way. David, aka my Late Night Food Angel, was beyond patient with me as I straddled between the doorway and the outside sidewalk in front of my car. I did not want to rouse my then sleeping 9 mos old twin granddaughters and leaving them is never an option. He made suggestions and based on my vegan needs, provided me with the perfect menu. The simplicity of ordering was greatly appreciated. David brought my food out to me and upon taking my payment brought my card back quickly and did not walk away until he was sure I had everything I needed. My food was delicious, guilt free and served with perfect customer service. Kuddos to Jason's Deli and David for making my night"}
{"text":"Our company ordered Jason's food for a lunch meeting.  The order was for about 20 people to be delivered at noon.  When the food arrived, each person correctly got what they ordered.  However, not much else went right.

First, the food arrived over a half hour late, which is a problem when you have a tight schedule.

Second, most people were either barely satisfied or unhappy with their food.  My corned beef sandwich was made with inferior meat -- great gobs of fat and stringy.  No packets of mustard or anything else were included.  Everything else I saw was very basic.  There were lots of unfinished lunches.  

Possibly Jason's does better if you go to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love that the company is adding  more organic options.  Favorite items are Muffalattas and gumbo as they are very rare at restaurants in this city.  I always see cleaning behind the counters,  and dining area before I leave.   Salad bar looks good.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.   Each time it's  clean and the staff is friendly.   Food presentation is good.  Taste is very good.  Potatoes are huge!  The decor is better than average.   One of my favorite locations in the city."}
{"text":"I ordered my sandwich to go and got home and it was not correct. I called the store and the staff and manager were so nice. They delivered the correct sandwich to my doorstep within 25 minutes! Simply the best customer service I have seen awhile. Thank you..."}
{"text":"This was my1st time @ Jason's Deli - ever. . . How could I have gone through life for so long w/out trying this place?? My bf says he tried to take me when we lived in Albuquerque but if it didnt serve alcohol he thought I wouldnt want to go?? hmmm.. that was back in my partying days so i'll dismiss it. Anyway, I had 1/4 muffaletta - I orig. ordered the 1/2 but the cashier was like... um. I order th 1/4 and its very filling.. ill take that as a compliment that he thought I was too small or finicky to finish a 1/2.. I like that.. this place is a winner already! 
He was right the 1/4 was perfect.. came with side of ruffles w/ ridges potatoe chips.. and sliver of kosher deli pickle. - so good together. the sandwhich was exactly how i pictured it. the ham & salami coupled with the olive tepanade..oooh with the crunchy yet soft inner bread. I'd def order that again. It also came with a cup of soup. They had about a dozen or so to chose from.. You'd have thought I was @ sweet tomatoes or something! I went w/ the Poblano Corn Chowder. so good - perfect actually and my bf said he was officially addicted to it. :) 
Other chose included: Texas chili, chicken chili, broc. cheese, Tomato & basil, Fire Roasted Tortilla Soup, veggie, and others i cant remember. My bf ordered the chicago.. good but small for his palate. please note we had just come from the gym and it was a weight training day =- we were there for about an hr 1/2.... so he was starving!. Perfect for a girl but a lil light for a grown man. I left my chips and shared my deli. soup. If i were to go again I'd order the salad bar and it was a beautiful fresh looking spread - also including desserts - mini muffins, etc. they even had cottage cheese.. take that sweet tomatoes!  - - ooh and my fav = frozen yogurt.. Cant' have a salad bar w/ out it. Its a must try."}
{"text":"I was walking my puppy through uptown this past Friday around lunch time when I decided to swing into Jason's deli to grab a soup and sandwich.  Sitting outside I figured the only way I could order the food and not worry about leaving the puppy for too long was to place the order online.  While I was sifting through this process the manager Jason, was continually coming in and out of the restaurant asking customers how there meal was, welcoming them into the restaurant and holding the door for them.  Shortly after he had asked me if he could assist with anything, so I explained how I was trying to order online, ex.  He generously took my order went back inside and placed it for me.  He brought my puppy some water and when my food was done brought it out and didn't charge me a thing.  This is amazing customer service, he was so super friendly, curtious, and cared about his customers - not only that but the food as expected was delish.  I have nothing but good things to say about Jason's Deli in Uptown!"}
{"text":"This is going to sound so random, but I so love the complimentary Ginger Bread muffin they offer in the salad bar. I've yet to have it anywhere else."}
{"text":"Loved my California Club Croissant with tomato basil soup with cheddar! I was able to substitute the fruit side or fresh veggie side with one of their soups. The cashier was more than happy to do it. Made my day."}
{"text":"Needed to find a lunch spot near my eye doctor as I had to come back in an hour.
The selection of good places on Maryland are very limited to say the least.So we decided to give this one a try. The interior seems to have seen better times. Ordered the mixed green salad with chicken.While there could have been more chicken it was cooked perfectly and tender. But too many croutons . My granddaughter ordered a sandwich which was made to order.
They do have a free soft serve ice  cream machine...help yourself. 
The price was a little high and a better value would be Sweet Tomatoes however there are none in the area.
All in all it was OK"}
{"text":"Jason´s Deli is one of my neighborhood favorites. The main reason I like them is due to their salad bar buffet. Sometimes I like to get back into healthy eating and do not want to prepare a healthy meal at home and for only $9 (incl. taxes) you can eat as much as you want from the salad bar. Besides the salad bar they offer great soups, sandwiches and desserts. 
The other great benefit is that they offer free ice-cream for anyone who eats there. 

The place is nice, clean, and modern. It has plenty of seating, booths and individual tables that can be place together in case a larger group would like to eat there. They also have a nice outdoor seating area located on the top patio overseeing the fountain. In the summertime it is certainly nice to eat indoors due to the heat, but we aware their AC is cranked up. Bring a hoodie/cardigan to cover yourself in case you are coming in a tank shirt. 

The staff is always friendly and helpful. And the overall price range is super affordable.
The salad bar is amazing. It includes quinoa, noodle salads, lettuce, eggs, all types of vegetables, fruits, crackers, dressings and even pudding and yogurt. This is truly unbeatable.

And last but certainly not least, Jason´s Deli focuses on healthy options. A few things are organic, and the salad bar has quality vegetables, which you can taste. 

I would highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"As an Eastsider the only problem with this place is that it is on the West Side. Any time I try to convice another Eastsider to go here it's like that Lion King meme where Simba asks about that \"dark space\" and every Eastsider replies \"that is the West Side - you must never go there.\"

I exaggerate, a little, but this place really is worth it! The salad bar is fresh and delicious. The options are ridiculous and there is always something that will tempt even the most picky of taste buds. All of the sandwiches are stacked high and there is nothing that I have seen come out of that kitchen that did not look tasty. Also - their deli pickles are amazing...it's those little touches that get a place to have 5 stars. 

To be completely open it does seem to be a dollar more than I would expect, however, there is free soft serve at the end if you dine in! Fair trade."}
{"text":"The Salad Bar after Yoga. Perfect! And yes, free ice cream (not needed bit I poured a \"swirl\"). LOL. Coming back any night I have Yoga at the Charlotte Athletic Club. Jason's Deli location is perfect! ;)"}
{"text":"The Texas Style Spud was YUGE weighing in at probably 4-pounds of potato, butter, bbq beef brisquit, and cheddar cheese. It is easily worth two meals so pace yourself when chowing down on it. Save half for the next day beakfast or lunch. Mmmmmm good."}
{"text":"The desire for Southern Sweet Tea brought me to Jason's Deli over a year and a half ago.  It was oh so good back then and I couldn't wait to have more!  I even had a chance to try their Muffalettas that time!

When I walked into Jason's Deli again, i was super excited!  I couldn't wait to get a big cup of Sweet Tea ($1.59)!  I opted for their Manager's Half Sandwich Special, which is half of any sandwich on the menu (excluding muffalettas) and your choice of one: cup of soup, read beans with sausage and rice, spicy gumbo, chili or fruit for $6.50.  I had the Grilled Portobello Panini ($6.50), 'grilled portobello mushroom marinated in leo's italian dressing, fresh avocado spread, homemade pico de gallo, fresh spinach, and asiago cheese that's pressed between olive oil basted french bread.'  This actually isn't on the menu, but it's the combination of the Chicken Panini and the Grilled Portobello Wrapini.  I had the Tomato Basil soup with my sandwich.  My panini was yummy, a bit small though, but still very good.  It also came with Jason's potato chips.  I had a few stale ones in my batch though.  And the soup was yummy as well. 

The BF had the Chicken Panini, 'marinated chicken breast with provolone cheese, basil pesto spread, sliced roma tomatoes and fresh spinach that's pressed between olive oil basted french bread' along with a cup of gumbo soup.  I just realized that I have no idea how his panini tasted because he never offered me a bite!  (Hmmff!  And you KNOW he got a bite of mine!)  I can't even comment on his gumbo either!

My friend had the California Club ($6.25), 'oven roasted turkey breast, homemade guacamole, tomato, sprouts, bacon, swiss, and mayo on a tasted all butter croissant.'  He proclaimed, \"It was the best sandwich I have ever had!\"  Unfortunately, his wife had the Chicken Pot Pie which she said was not good at all.  She barely touched it.  

The cool thing about Jason's Deli is that they offer free refills on their beverages, free soft serve, and free muffins!  Unfortunately, they ran out of the Sweet Tea!  This was maddening and they claimed they didn't have anymore for a Saturday afternoon!  The BF and I were deeply distraught about this incident.  When we asked another employee if they refilled the tea yet, she replied, \"You can go up there and check...\"  Gosh, I guess I'm used to a bit better customer service.  Oh well, what can you say?

Overall, at Jason's Deli you go up and give your order and then pay for it.  You take your number and help yourself to your own beverages.  Take a seat and wait awhile for your food. Your order is brought to you on a tray and that's the end of the customer service there.  The menu ranges from soups to salads to pasta to wraps to baked potatoes to favorite sandwiches to make your own sandwiches to muffalettas to po'boys to paninis and wrapinis and a few desserts even.  They have a pretty large menu to choose from.  Since April 15, 2005, all their restaurants became free of partially hydrogenated oils, which means \"no trans fat\"!    

Yeah...I'll be back for their Sweet Tea...but you KNOW I'll be checking to make sure they have enough for our refills!"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time today after driving by multiple times. Ordered the Italian special half sandwich, chips, potato salad and a large drink. All of this was only $11.00 and I felt like it was a great deal. Plus the meal came with a half dill pickle. The food was really great and I felt like the meat was sliced perfectly thin. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Sandwich I ever had so far! I had the \"Deli Club Sandwich\" it was so delio!  They had a salad bar to which is awesome! And free ice cream!!"}
{"text":"Good stuff. Great service every time!  Good lunch stop with soup and salad.  Love their strawberry shortcake and salad bar."}
{"text":"If you are looking for something healthy, here is the place! i always get the Cantina wrap and tomato basil they are the best! They also have a salad bar available. Did I mention that they also have soft serve ice cream? :)"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, salads, coffee and free Ice cream!!

Service is pretty good too only downside is the menu can be confusing for first timers"}
{"text":"First time here and I loved it!! The food was great and their menu is pretty big; from salads, to soups, pastas and sandwiches. Staff was friendly. Place was clean. 

The worker who brought my food to the table was outgoing and assured me to ask for anything I needed. I can't believe I haven't been to a Jason's deli before. I will be back for sure. 

(And free ice cream!!)"}
{"text":"Was just as good in person, friendly, good food, and air conditioning. A LOT of air conditioning. (Bring a sweater)."}
{"text":"I joined @rscottjones for lunch at @JasonsDeli.

I had the quarter-muff DEAL. (Quarter muffaletta, and I opted for the seafood gumbo)

If what I had constitutes a quarter of a full sandwich, I could feed my family on one muffaletta; it was HUGE! Definitely enough to satisfy me, and an especially great combination with the gumbo.

The gentleman at the counter warned me that the gumbo was very spicy. While there was a bit of a bite, it was certainly not as much as he led me to believe, which was actually a little bit of a disappointment. (I love it hot!)

A delicious, and pretty quick, lunch.

Bonus; free softserve ice cream!

I'll be back, as it's close to work."}
{"text":"What a great lunch spot! I've been here several times and it's always good. Jason's is perfect because they have something for everyone. Even the pickiest of eaters will love Jason's Deli. They have great sandwiches, soups and even a huge salad bar. 
I usually get the salad bar. It's loaded with all my favorite veggies, assorted olives and my favorite pickles! On my recent visit I ordered their Muffuletta and it came with a choice of soup or salad. Since I love their salad bar it was an easy choice. I started to load up on the veggies and found my lunch buddies for the day Dyanna and Brent. Then my sandwich was delivered to the table it was huge!! Plus, it came with chips. The olive tapenade was amazing with the ham and salami. What a great sandwich. 

Jason's deli is exactly that a deli! They have a big variety of home cooked soups. The salad bar is always fresh and stocked. They also have an ice cream machine if your in a dessert mood. If your in a hurry call in your order they will have it ready for you. Love Jason's deli! Great food, fresh ingredients and friendly staff make the perfect recipe."}
{"text":"Okay, I know this place is a chain but damn, Jason's Deli is the epitome of what a true sandwich, soup and salad resto should be!   They offer a nice variety of everything, not to mention a salad bar!

The s/o and I both ordered the Manager's Special which was half a sandwich and a cup of soup or salad.  I got the Club Royale, which was Turkey, Ham, Bacon and Swiss on a Croissant, which made a tasty sandwich.  I got it with a cup of French Onion soup, which was way delicious and surprised me 100x over as I had such low expectations for it.  But it was served correctly with the cheese melted on top and over, granted it wasn't melted to a slight brown crisp, it so fixed my craving.  The s/o ordered their Ruben the Great, which was piled on with Corned Beef and Pastrami.  At other sandwich spots,  you'd get that much meat for the whole sandwich, and this was just HALF!  The s/o opted for a side salad, which was one trip to the salad bar. The s/o came back with a huge smile saying it was the most awesome salad bar in a resto that he's ever been to, as apparently they had all these premium toppings, as well as dessert to boot.

Add two sodas, well, mine was technically their Sweet Tea which was freshly brewed and so bomb by the way; our bill came out to $20 and some change.  Not bad for a nice, quality, cafe style lunch!  The s/o was so impressed that the s/o was trying to figure out how we can come back before our flight back home!

Please Jason's Deli, open up a location in the SF Bay Area...preferrably around the Silicon Valley, thanks! :)  Show Panera how it's done!!!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy going here especially when I'm in the mood eat healthy. I really like the salad bar because they keep all the veggies and toppings fresh. The casual atmosphere and the large space makes me feel comfortable and relaxed to eat at my own pace. I must say this is a go to spot for a laid-back lunch or early dinner!"}
{"text":"Ok. Not my first time here.  Should of  got the Reuben but stuck with the salad bar. Ok. No frills.  Partner had the tomato soup and grilled cheese. The soup was like a think marinara.  Horrible and too thick."}
{"text":"Love their salad bar, so much to eat, not as much as sweet tomatoes but good nevertheless! Only suggestion would b if they can get the labels on foods, bcs for people like me who don't eat meat its very difficult to figure out that there's tuna in one of their salads without a label! I almost ate it, so I hope they take this into account! My best is the whole boiled eggs though :)"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this Jason's Deli another chance and my family and I returned recently. This time seemed to be a better experience. The service was much better this time and the people were much more friendly and helpful. The food was very good just like the previous visit. So this location has increased from 2 to 4 stars in my book. Well done Jason's Deli for turning things around in a few short months."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli has the biggest best selection of quality food.  I mostly get the Ranchero Chicken wrap, the chicken they use is absolutely delicious.  Everything I have tried here from the loaded baked potato, to the salads are excellent quality.  I normally call my order in and it is always correct & ready when I get there.  All the employees are friendly and professional.  I visit this location at least a couple times a week and always satisfied.  You can never go wrong because they have something for everyone....."}
{"text":"I just don't know what to get here I guess.  I've had the club royal, the pastrami, muffaletta, Italian sub. I look around and I see everyone really enjoying there food but it just doesn't do it for me. I think I'm doing something wrong. I hate the fact that they center load their sandwiches that make the meat portions look huge (it's hard to get the first bite in your mouth)  but by the time you get to the end of the bun it is just bread. I should just tell them to keep their chips because i never eat them.  I just don't really like potato chips. I wasn't aware the ice cream was complimentary."}
{"text":"When I want to treat myself to a lunch off the beatend path... I sometimes choose this place. So today (after walking around town for 20mins trying to find a spot that i DON'T frequent often) I stopped by Jason's. 

I usually get the salad bar. Its been a while but  i remember getting a half sandwich and salad:
(Half-Sandwich with Side Salad, chips & pickle 7.99) combo. Where they will give u a empty salad container and you fill it up as you like.. (no wieghting scale.. so pile it on. for this special)

Today I got the Club Royale 
Toasted croissant with smoked turkey breast,
ham, bacon, Swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato,
honey mustard. 6.99

Never been here and had a BAD expierence so that's A PLUS all by itself."}
{"text":"Very good food and they deliver!  Awesome place for the price. Great Value."}
{"text":"Love their salad bar, it has all the classics, my favorite is the iceburg, olives, peppers, red onions, Cheddar cheese,blue cheese dressing or ranch they are all good, boiled egg, cottage cheese, variety of crackers and pudding, jello, nuts you name it and at the end have a mini icecream all you can eat,  And their baked potatoes are the best!!!!!"}
{"text":"Soooo delicious. This location was clean and not too busy at 2pm. All the staff were friendly. Food was fast and super Fresh. Such a big menu makes it hard to choose but I had chicken salad, fruit, pasta salad and the gingerbread muffins."}
{"text":"I routinely order Jason's Deli sandwich and wrap trays for working lunches at my office.  Ordering from their online site is a cinch and delivery is always a few minutes early, or on time to the minute.  Their delivery drivers are also professional and friendly as well.  

The food is always fresh and delicious each and every time, and it always comes with all the plates, napkins, utensils, ice, cups and other accoutrements needed to serve it too.  Among my personal favorite items from Jason's are their wraps, and in particular their vegetarian wrap with mushrooms, Asiago cheese, bell peppers and Romaine lettuce).  Their Chicken Alfredo pasta is just amazing for lunch on a cold day and another favorite item for a cold day is their Tomato Basil soup which is absolutely delicious and served with a side of soft bread.  

Another big plus about catering from Jason's Deli for work lunches is that you accumulate 'Deli Dollars' with each order and over the course of a year's worth of office lunches I had accumulated enough Deli Dollars to pay for all the food for my teenage daughter's 15th birthday party.  Then by the next year I had accumulated enough Deli Dollars once again to cater the food my baby daughter's 1st birthday.  It was wonderful to be able to hold each birthday party for the girls and not have to worry at all about preparing the food.

I had Jason's Deli catered in today and the only thing wrong with today's lunch was that the pasta salad was very oily (which isn't normal for them) but aside from that I have absolutely no complaints about today's lunch delivery...

Rock on Jason's, rock on."}
{"text":"Ate here on Wednesday night and the food was not very good.  I ordered the Mediterranean Wrap with a diet soda and my boyfriend ordered the salad bar and a chicken sandwich.  I had three small pieces of olive pit that I bit down on that were in my wrap.  I did not to mention anything cause it happens...  However, the Mediterranean Wrap was nothing very special.  It was for $6.59, but I could have gotten a sub from Subway that was more for my money...  My boyfriend's sandwich was okay.. He said the salad bar was good.  The chicken meat kept falling out of his sandwich..  The people that worked there were very friendly. Food was not up to par.. 
We will not be coming back due to the disappointing food."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Jason's Deli and I am a fan.  I had lunch there twice actually.  The first time I just had the salad bar, which was very good.  The second time I had a reuben sandwich and it was amazing.  They have something here for everyone and the place was clean and the staff was friendly.  To top it off they have free soft serve ice cream :o)"}
{"text":"Lunch time .... where to go??? Jason's! Great menu for soups & sandwiches  and of course a nice salad bar. I decided it was time to get some greens into the mix so watch out salad bar, here i come. Everything is fresh and well maintained despite it constantly being picked over. plenty of booths & tables to accomodate the lunch crowd. Not a fan of the parking configuration. Jasons is kinda like sweet tomatoes but with sandwiches on the menu plus they deliver. You can also order online. One of the servers even came to the table to check on me which was nice."}
{"text":"These guys are always nice even on one occasion when the girl was being fresh but she cleaned it up and we laughed about it.."}
{"text":"Jason's deli is great.. I always order their managers half sandwich and soup special. Their half sandwich is large and I love getting baked chips. Their soups are really good and my favorite is the gumbo (broccoli and cheese is my 2nd fav)  

Everyone is always very nice. too.  Their salad bar is as fresh as you can get. They have awesome chocolate mousse avail and well they are just an all around great place to goto for lunch.  You won't be disappointed.  I've been many times and ordered different sandwiches and I've enjoyed my lunch every single time.

Their prices are really good too, and you get a great amnt of food for the price.  I never feel over charged at all."}
{"text":"Bummer! No one told me about the free soft serve ice cream here until I just read the other reviews.  Oh well, ignorance is bliss since I was aiming to eat a healthy lunch.  I chose this place because it promised it was free of artificial trans fats, MSG and HFCS.  I had the Nutty Mixed Up Salad (minus the chicken) which consisted of organic field greens, grapes, feta cheese, walnuts, dried cranberries, pumpkin seeds, raisins and organic apples, served with a balsamic vinaigrette on the side  It was a generous portion and only $6.49.  It was really delicious."}
{"text":"I came to this location for a take out order (been here before maybe twice) and wanted to have the Zucchini garden pasta. The order says that it comes with zucchini, artichokes and spinach. I asked them to add the mushrooms and their signature tomato basil soup/sauce on it as it is pretty good. However, came home to discover that the dish came with just the bowtie pasta and zucchini with a whole lot of pasta sauce!! I did not pay so much for that dish to have just pasta+sauce and no veggies as advertised. Could go across the street to have some real Italian! Will not visit this location again!"}
{"text":"Hot pastrami is always cold.  Always have to ask to warm the meat. WHYYYYYYYYY?

Salad bar and free ice cream is best thing happening.  Oh and staff is nice"}
{"text":"This place wasn't very good. .. I ordered the smokey jack panini  and it wasn't a panini. It was old, dry bread with old tomatoes. I couldn't even finish it. Paninis are hot and flattened,  but this one was cold and looked like a sub. Would not recommend at all. It looked like it was a 3 day old sandwich."}
{"text":"I loved our sandwiches and the complimentary low cal ice cream was a huge plus. We ordered takeout.  I had the california club on a new orleans french roll. It was wonderful - crispy french roll, guacamole, sprouts, tomato, turkey and swiss. Everything tasted fresh and looked prepared with love. Nothing looked pre-made. Husband had the pastrami melt - it was delish - I dare say I liked his sandwhich more than mine. I am just so happy to have found a deli near Ahwatukee that isn't full of pre-made sandwiches on nasty bread.....Jason's Deli will be our new favorite close to home."}
{"text":"A nice little deli that has great selections for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. The service was quick and the food was pretty great, however the atmosphere seemed to be disrupted by the constant yelling of some supervisor/manager who was trying to \"motivate\" her employees to work faster. That works great if the food preparing is somewhere in the back, but out in front where customers can see and hear you is annoying. Shut the hell up and let people enjoy their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Excellent deli. I recommend the beef eater. Amazing. Full of flavor. And nick with the stache awesome dude. Very  polite. Smiled the whole time. Made my visit here absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"I have been to various Jason's Deli locations throughout the U.S., and they just never seem to satisfy.  Most of the time, they mess up my order.  I can only recall one time when I've escaped Jason's Deli without some kind of incident or mistake.  And what's the deal with the gazillion tables in this place???  

Plus one star for the graham crackers you can find on the salad bar.  Their graham crackers kick butt.  I don't know what they do to them, but they're better than any other I've had.  It's everything I can do not to stuff my purse full of graham crackers and live off them for a few weeks.  Seriously.  Try the graham crackers.  Really... try them.  Really.  I mean it."}
{"text":"I visited this location to get some take out with my 9 month old baby. I was treated very respectfully before I even entered, an employee held open the door for me, offered to set up a table with a high chair for me and greeted me with a smile. I ordered our food and headed over to the drink station, while attempting to fill two cups and hold a baby I spilled my tea and an employee swooped in and cleaned up my spill and finished filling my drinks. I carried them out to the car and came back to wait for our food. Again door held another employee offered a high chair, I advised I was waiting for my take out order the manager went and located my order and brought it to me. The food was excellent but the service was outstanding!!! Thanks for going above and beyond."}
{"text":"First time and very impressed..  fabulous salad bar.  Very fresh food. Employees constantly restocking and maintaining bar.  Extremely friendly staff..  we will be back soon.."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. The food has always been very good for this type of fare. The ice cream dessert is a nice touch. I've had sandwiches, soup, salad bar and kids macaroni and cheese. We've enjoyed all of them. I wish the prices were slightly lower. The place is clean with a friendly atmosphere and wonderful customer service if you order inside. I've used the drive thru 3 times and this is their downfall and why they lost a star for me. Each time they have not taken my order for a while even though there's no line. I actually waited 5 mins once and said \"hello\" a few times and then drove away when no one took my order. It takes a while to get your order in and then it takes a while to get your food. My soup was cold by the time I got it home which was about 10 mins later and they didn't give me a spoon or any napkins or anything. Overall a good place but they need to keep working on perfecting the drive thru experience."}
{"text":"1st time here and have to say the food is good. The only real complaint I have is the portion size of the food. Most other places have bigger portion sizes then here.

The place looked nice and the staff was pretty friendly. Clean and bigger then I thought.

I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich with pickel and chips. Taste wise, it was delicious with its guacamole and bacon. There was big pieces of chicken with excellent flavor. Not really a big fan of wheat bread, but it was also pretty good. 

Overall........I'll be back with the family and try Porboy Sandwich."}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars but, because the service was lacking I'm giving 4 stars, from the time I walked in the order pick up door (I ordered ahead online) I was never greeted not even to say \"I will be with you in just a moment\" instead I stood there like I was invisible and finally an older guy comes over and says \"can I help you?\" I give him my name and then he says my food should be ready soon (I ordered 30 min prior to picking my order up) so, I sit down and then I hear the other worker saying \"I already bagged her order and it's sitting there) mind you that was a good 8 to 10 minutes SMH next time I may just have my food delivered but then again they always seem to forget something.  At least their food is good"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location several times. The staff are always friendly and helpful and the food is very good."}
{"text":"Yum Yum. the salad bar has a great selection (although I would have liked some more fruit choices). The staff is fast and courtious and a bit funny at times.  Loved the chicken salad but it might not be for everyone - it has pineapple and nut in it.  The best thing is that there is enough seating that you don't have to walk around aimlessly looking for a space to eat.  Another plus is that the to go reister is seperate."}
{"text":"We are frequent customers here at Jason's Deli and every experience has been great. The staff is very friendly, awesome food and a positive atmosphere. We wanted to say that Chad has done an exceptional job taking care of us the last two times we have been in. He even compensated for us when the deli was out of an item we wanted and we were very thankful. Keep up the great work as we will be back later this week!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a pastrami sandwich and a Podnah spud!  Delicious meal with the wife, great customer service and even the manager Ivory was very friendly!   Great food, great company!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are huge and always fresh! 
Two favorites: salmon-wich and the vegetable caprese. So good!"}
{"text":"Went for the salad bar and it was one of the best! Nice staff too. Their gingerbread muffins are to die for... And the chocolate pudding!"}
{"text":"They are always accomodating for special requests or substitutions.  The service is fast and friendly and my family likes the quick in and out.  They sent us $5 off for a birthday gift and I think that is a nice touch to show they appreciate their customers.  I LOVE the kid friendly menu that has more options than most places and organic is a plus in our book!  My daughter adores the free ice cream and she would pick Jason's deli almost every time if given the choice.  My husband loves the pastrami there and I love the flexibility."}
{"text":"First time I had been to this location,  food is always pretty good for the price. The service wasn't anything special, I waited for a few minutes before someone came to the register to take my to go order. Nothing to make me say I wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years but lately .. Oh my gosh dirty filthy bathrooms .. No bread ( rolls ) hum sandwich joint .. We found out because after a 1/2 hr we went up to check ..\" Oh sorry we don't have any kind of rolls today \" ...\" Ok fine just put it on white bread \" we waited 10 mins .. Got a reimburse & went to Panera"}
{"text":"A little confusing when you first walk in because it's so big, but the salad bar is phenomenal and the menu is huge.  Everything is fresh!"}
{"text":"So helpful! I am currently out of state and my fiance is sick and wanted soup so I called to get some delivered. Unfortunately they had already stopped delivering but I spoke with the manager, Matt, and he made an exception. I couldn't have been happier with the service!"}
{"text":"Jason's Deli never disappoints.  The salad bar is the best I've ever had, loaded with tons of fresh veggies, choices, and always kept clean.  The free ice cream is a great perk!  
I usually get one of the wraps, or the soups.  Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I started going here in college.  Then my wife and I ate together here. Now my wife, my two children and I go out and eat here. They have a great selection of food their staff is awesome and my kids go crazy for the free ice cream.  My wife loves the pot roast sandwich.  I can't get enough of the salmonwich.  If you've got kids apparently their Mac and cheese is the best.  My daughter asks me every time we go if it's kids' night.  Great family restaurant.  I will apparently be eating there for many years to come."}
{"text":"I had been to one of these in Kansas and had to see if this one was just as good.  It is!  Great salad bar and sandwiches.  I love this place!  I always get the manager's special half sandwich half salad.  The side salad you get is a good size bowl for a one time trip to the salad bar.  If you order a sandwich from the lite menu you can get a side of fruit also that comes with yummy yogurt to dip your fruit in.  So good!  I wish they had more in Southern California."}
{"text":"Whoever Jason is... he's doing something right.

I stop in here for lunch every now and then and always enjoy my meal. The variety available of soups/salads/sandwiches is sure to please any palate. The wait staff is always friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is casual and the place is consistently clean! 

I really enjoy the salad bar with its assortment of organics, veggies and dressings.  However, during the lunch rush it feels more like a pack of wolves on a 3 legged cat trying to push through the line. I'm a little ashamed to admit I've almost thrown elbows to go for the last little bit of bacon in the bottom of the bowl on occasion.

Once you stuff yourself with greens you can help yourself to a FREE ice cream cone on the way out the door. Yes, FREE! The ice cream cone puts Jason's near the top of my lunch list!"}
{"text":"I came here for a quick dinner.  The service was good and fast.  The cashier was helpful and guided me through the ordering process since it was my first time.  The food was good and the salad bar was fresh and neat.  I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Hmmm. Jasons deli.. deffinetly Not my Fave sanwich spot. Shit I even like subway better than this. But the foods Not gross . Just Not that tasty.. soo of your looking for something healthy u could come here but dont expect flavorful taste bud appeasing sanwiches. Very mediocre. I guess they have free ice crem idk tho I dont eat it."}
{"text":"I tried the New York Yankee sandwich and it was very delicious and HUGE. Half pastrami and half corned beef. I was worried because I expected the sandwich to be very salty, given the pastrami and lack of veggies - but I was wrong! Layered high with stoneground mustard (spicy mustard), mayo, and cheese - this sandwich was perfectly salted. The sandwich was so large it fed both my boyfriend and me. It also came with a pickle and your choice of regular or baked chips. I ordered for take-out this time, but next time I may eat in as I saw they have a salad bar that looked pretty good! I will be back."}
{"text":"We got two potatoes one plain Jane and on texas. The plain Jane was amazing everything you would expect in a backed potato. The Texas potato is a different story it's basically pulled pork with BBQ and cheese, in my own opinion it wasn't that good my dad and siblings think so too.  We also got spaghetti it was bowtie pasta and meatballs and WAY to much tomato sauce. They do give free self sever ice cream so that was a plus I guess. Sadly the food does take one star away. Other than that the experience and food was delicious and the staff were kind. We will come back but not a lot sadly."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, but it's overpriced - if the service was quicker it might not be a problem, but if you want a single sandwich to go, be ready to wait between 30 and 45 minutes for it even if the restaurant is dead empty for your $13 ordeal. More food than that, just give up and go to a grocery store. The employees run the gamut between understandably dead-eyed and bored teenagers to rude and unruly teenagers who need to go run on a hamster wheel for a few hours before being released safely back into society. I've been to this location a few times, thinking maybe I just hit it during a bad hour, but it's slow and headache inducing every single time. Pity, because the sandwiches aren't bad."}
{"text":"I was admonished twice in two days for whining about the lack of salad bars in Charlotte while having never been, so I came to ze old JD's last week on a powerlunch. 

Nothing like shoveling 3 pounds of greens and toppings down your throat while trying to look cool and have a business meeting. Won't be trying that again.

Onto the importante stuffs! Agree, mon freres, that this is the best SB in CLT. Is it great? Nein. Is it sufficient? Oui! There's enough legumes and veggies on offer that even my veganbud could eat her weight in a satisfyingly diverse pile of veggies, beans, and seeds. Multiple non-dairy dressings as well, plus plus.

It's a bummer that soup, bread, anything you want other than Saltines and \"organic crackers\" is extra, but hey, this isn't Sweet Tomatoes (GOD how I wish it was). Also, labeling on the varying prepared salads (Veg, vegan, GF, etc) would make it so I don't freak out when biting down on something that could very well be bacon."}
{"text":"Ate lunch there twice now, has almost like an upscale look but still affordable. I had the meatball sandwich and a bowl of fruit. Everything was nice and fresh and they also offer a salad bar and they do catering as well. I would recommend this place if you like sandwiches, they have some interesting combo's with different flavors, like this new chicken salad sandwich that has pineapple within. Nice, clean and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"ive never really been a fan of jasons deli besides the fact they do serve a healthier variety of food but the potaotes are pretty good. if you eat here the salad bar is pretty cool and of course some free dessert when you eat here some soft serve ice cream will hit the spot after."}
{"text":"Not too crazy about this place. I ordered a pastrami on rye and it was just a pile of meat on soggy bread."}
{"text":"It had been a while since we were there.  We'd go there more if they stayed open past 9.  We have always liked their salad bar and soups and had a Jones for them so we went a couple weeks back.

The Chicken Noodle Soup was salty to the point of not so good.  We ate it, but they need to change brands.

The salad bar was as good as always.  The side selections options like hummus, olives, and other salads are good.  They muffins to go along with the salad and soup are nice and fresh.

Now, if they can extend their hours to even 9:30, we'd be there more again."}
{"text":"If I could leave no stars I would. I was surprised when entering the store at 630p and literally only 2 tables were occupied.  I haven't been here in over 6 months and nothing has improved. The bread on my ssndwich was stale and contained little meat. While eating my ssndwich,  I saw a deli clerk named \"Eva\" take previously made fruit plates from the display case and disassemble them and placing the ingredients on the line. All the plates had expiration dates on them. This is a health code violation. I was absolutely discussed. Iwas taking pictures and another employee saw me and went and got her manager. Eva then brought the remaining plates into the kitchen area. After several employee stood and stared at me until I keft. The manager nevef came over to talk to me. He obviously doesn't care. I will be contacting the Southern Nevada Health district. I have no intention of evef returning to any Jason's again."}
{"text":"Can't beat the gluten free bread and many selections for gluten free options.  Nice to have when I'm traveling."}
{"text":"The service here is not even good enough to call AWFUL. No smiles,no proper greeting, and the place is highly unorganized, and unclean. The utensils were out and not stocked, and the whole fountain area was in disarray. 

They should be embarrassed, and the manager should be replaced by a detail and customer service oriented person.

The highlight is that the Pot Roast sandwich, and strawberry shortcake were fantastic."}
{"text":"The only thing I would change about Jason's Deli is the location. I want it much, much closer to where I work so I don't have to travel fifteen minutes to lunch there, indulge in an massive, awesome meal and end up trying to sneak a super extended lunch past the bosses upon my return. 

But before I get started, I'm going to throw out a disclaimer. I've only been to Jason's Deli once due to the distance.

(My internal feud over whether to admit my inexperience went like this:
We've only been once, so how do we know it wasn't a fluke?
Well it was fucking delicious. So check.
But maybe the next time we go it'll taste like rat jerky and the service will suck? 
The croissant was buttery heaven, the soup was full of flavor, the strawberries were ruby red gems of sweetness and the meal was so big we had it for lunch and dinner! I think that's check and mate, good sir.
Gah! Yeah, but we've Only. Been. Once. Is any of this getting through to you?
Uh, fine you panty-waisted pansy. Post your disclaimer. You just gave me reason to rave even harder.   ...douche.)

It's very reminiscent of Miracle Mile in the way it's arranged, with cafeteria style seating and a queue (I just wanted to use that word) where you order, file through, pay for your meal and wait for them to call your magic number or bring it to your table.  

First, the menu is massive with everything from fancy potatoes and pasta dishes to muffalettas and \"slimwiches.\" There are to-go menus hanging out by the door so you can take your time wavering between the po'boy and the panini before you even get close to the guy that takes your order, a refreshing change compared to the hustle and bustle, \"Move along cattle!\" type treatment you get at Miracle Mile. They have a ginormous all-you-can-eat salad bar off to the side with deli salads (potato, pasta, fruit, etcetera), gingerbread muffins and tons of organic veggies. I won't lie. It was tempting. The prices are also way reasonable compared to Miracle Mile, with gargantuan sandwiches, big dressed potatoes and plentiful salads between six and seven bucks. Seriously, nothing on the menu is over seven bucks except for the muffalettas (which are fun to say, but I only have a vague idea what the heck they are).

Go with the Manager's Half Sandwich Deal. Just trust me on this. It's 6.79 and is half a sandwich (muffs excluded, but they have their own quarter meal deal for 6.99) and your choice of soup, fruit or a side salad. One sneaky little surprise, if the sandwich on the menu says it comes with chips, a pickle, veggies, fruit, whatever (and most of them do), you still get that item in addition to your choice of side! It's a mountain of food, and the half sandwich resembles what a full sandwich would at regular delis (Fancy Pants Mile excluded).

I had the California Club, which came with turkey, guacamole, tomato, sprouts, bacon, swiss, and mayo on a buttery, flaky croissant. It was the things dreams are made of. The Texas chili was pretty good, but Mr. Man's tomato basil soup was rockin', and the fresh fruit was sweet and delicious.

And when you leave, feel free to wander up to the register and help yourself to to-go box (you're probably going to need it) and a super sturdy plastic to-go cup. Seriously. This is my new office cup. It's as sturdy if not sturdier as any cheap plastic ware you'd buy from Target. 

Yeah, it's official. This place is the bee's knees."}
{"text":"My first time ever here ,and it was right when they opened,so not busy at all this is why I was so surprised to see how filthy the food line was where they make sandwiches :/ The cashier was as friendly,and helpful as can be! Ok so I  ordered the reuben sandwich and it was just ok,the corn beef was a bit chewy (fatty),and chicken pot pie soup I had was tasty ,but the whole time I was eating it I was wondering if it was made in a clean pot (lol) ,on the other hand when I went up to the counter to ask for mustard,I noticed how filthy the food line was ,,yuck!!  (as I stated in the beginning of this review) It was not just messy from making sandwiches,it was not rotated,and it looked like everything was not covered at closing or any of the food containers were washed ,therefore all the meats,veggies,cheeses,etc.were dried out /old ...I have been in the food service industry for 19 years and notice/look for this type of thing...some say don't judge a book by its cover ,,but in this case you must if it's going in your body...I will not be eating here again ..."}
{"text":"Always happy with this place.  Great to order from when your on the go. Huge portions come hungry leave happy amd full :-)"}
{"text":"Staff are very friendly,food is always fresh and refilled. I wish they would have some type of customer loyalty discount or coupons. Great menu variety and great clean atmosphere.  Pricing could be more competitive.."}
{"text":"My first visit to a Jason's deli and it's wonderful! Love the little nods to southern food. Anyplace with sweet tea and gumbo are okay by me. It's clean and well maintained. 

I had the pastrami sandwich with grilled onions and au jus. It was sooo good. Also some potatoe salad and broccoli cheddar soup. The tea options are great too for a tea lover like myself. Awesome prices too. Only $15 for the two if us. 

The best part if the meal was the employees though! We were greeted by Russell upon entering with a great smile and a warm hello. Both Russell and Andrew helped my friend and I decide on our order. They were not just helpful but so sweet and came by our table several times to make sure we were taken care of. Great personalities.. Great staff! Thank you Russell and Andrew for making my first Jason's Deli experience awesome. 

I just wish they had one close to where I live in Orange County California!"}
{"text":"Good options . folks here were paitnet to get out specialized order. Nice experience."}
{"text":"Can't seem to get an order right. This used to be a decent place to order from, but in the past two weeks they screw up every order. And when you call about the screw up, they pretty much tell you to screw off."}
{"text":"We need this kind of place on the peninsula.  It is big, friendly, tasty,  and cheap.  Picture a deli that rivals the size of a local Safeway, staffed with patient people who are willing to help you navigate a gigantic menu of sandwiches, soups and salads.  

I had two different sadwiches on two different occasions.  The italian po boy was excellent.  It was too big, but otherwise perfect.  Later I had the meatball, which is good, but I the italian is better.

On top of the good sandwiches, they barrage you with free corn muffins, garlic toast, and ice cream.  People pile it sky high on plates - a great way to ensure they get full in case the 1,200 calorie sandwich does not do the trick.

Yum."}
{"text":"Four stars?  Five stars?  I had a hard time deciding.

I love a good sandwich.  I LOVE a good corned beef sandwich.  How could I not order that?  The \"manager's special\" is the way to go if you ask me.  A half sandwich plus a bowl of soup and chips.  All that for about about seven and a half bucks.  For a dollar, upgrade the soup to a trip to the salad bar.  I went with the salad bar and a half corned beef and swiss on rye.

OH MY!

Let's go back to the beginning.  We walked in and were greeted by friendly staff.  They were more than happy to let us stew over the menu for a while and answer any questions we had.  When it came time to order, they helped us figure things out (pointing out the Manager's Special).  The dining area is clean and very comfortable.  The outside dining looks inviting on these warm spring days.

The food has been ordered, now what?  We grab our salad plate and head to the well-stocked salad bar.  This itself could be a meal.  F'realz.  All the popular toppings plus some pasta salads.  No substantial meat to add on, but between crumbled bacon and boiled eggs, you can get your protein.  I made myself a meal-sized salad and it was pretty excellent.  

The sandwiches and chips arrived after we started in on our salads.  The corned beef was stacked high and looked great.  The rye bread was pretty standard - nothing horribly authentic or special, but it was sufficient to deliver the savory corned beef to my food hole.  SO GOOD!  The meat was exploding with flavor - I was half surprised, half elated.

While the salad would have been enough for my lunch meal, I didn't feel like I could leave the sandwich on the plate or banish it to a to-go container, so I finished it. Next time, I'll try to be smarter and stash that away for a mid-afternoon snack or dinner item.

Not enough you say?  Go get yourself some free ice cream!  Nothing special, but you can choose from vanilla or chocolate soft serve.  Swirl is an option as well.  There's some chocolate syrup available to dress it up if you like.  Small bowls and cones are the serving options.

So, bravo, Jason!  Your Deli as excellent!  

Why four stars and not five?  I continue to fight that.  Maybe some artisan bread to really make the sandwich pop.  Or some more authentic chips instead of whatever Lay's makes.  Don't get me wrong - I'll keep coming here to eat, and it's uh-mazing!"}
{"text":"BLT is always cold! Every single time. A deli should know how to put hot bacon on a BLT sandwich."}
{"text":"As I sit here finishing my meal about an hour from closing time, I am witnessing a fantastic team of employees doing their jobs well. The cashier that took my order is working the cashier, greeting customers, getting catering boxes prepared, and helping the other employees out. This is a fantastic showing that the manager here knows how to lead his team even when they are not busy. Occasionally somebody walks in and he goes right back to taking their orders and doing so with great efficiency. I love this place and like this location over the one off Park Rd. You will have a great experience here. I promise."}
{"text":"Having recently relocated to the area safe to say I won't be returning to this place. Terrible sandwich - poorly constructed dry bread and overpriced. Ugh."}
{"text":"Well, not impressed at all. No one barely in the place Saturday afternoon 4pm. Still took nearly 15 minutes to get our sandwiches made. I thought the prices were really reasonable at $8-9 while I was in line. The girl asked me if I wanted a full sandwich or the half. Full sandwich please. The sandwiches came out finally. A tiny little thing that I can't imagine anyone would only eat half of. In no hurry to ever return."}
{"text":"I don't know who Jason is, but his Deli is top notch!! This place is amazing.  This is definitely one of my most favourite places to go out for lunch.  Me and my coworkers been here like a bazillion times and than some.

The service here is always fast! No matter how busy they get, they are super efficient.  The staffs here..... super friendly and super attentive.  They are always smiling and always making sure we're alright.  I once was not able to try one of their bake potatoes because they sold out, and had to settle for their organic vegetable soup, which was amazing!  But out of no where a manager came and gave me a 20 dollar gift card so I could return to try the bake potato, that is a wonderful person.  That is great customer service.  BTW their bake potatoes are amazing and gigantic, you won't be able to finish it solo.  My subordinate usually do these survey things online to get a free cookie, however they stop giving out cookies, but they still gave him the cookie for doing the survey.  Totally caring staffs here.  Makes me feel bad stealing soda from them with the free water cup.  Jk I don't do that.....

Super high quality food here, organic fresh foods here.  Antibiotic free chickens and hormone free animals, and stuff like that.  Their sandwiches amazing, their chicken nuggets amazing, their soups amazing, the loo......amazing!  Their blueberry soda, amazing.....not that I would know I always got the water cup... The free ice cream and the salad bar is amazing! All those free nuts and berries and crackers of many kinds, amazing.  

Overall a super place, you'll love it here!!  I will definitely be back!  They once let my subordinate eat his sandwich in the loo because he was hungry but also needed to do a two and didn't know which to do first."}
{"text":"I sit here writing this review while suffering from the worst bout of food poisoning I've ever had in life. My family of 4 visited this location for lunch today - we've previously had terrible customer service experiences, so it's been a long time since we've been. 

My husband had the new lobster bisque chowder and it was so bland he had to snag some cheese from the salad bar just to make it through the bowl (and even then, he said it was so bad he couldn't eat anymore). 

I had the 1/2 turkey wrap and salad bar. This is where my day went to sh!t...literally. My wrap was so hard and crunchy, it poked me in my gum while I was trying to take a bite. I'm pretty certain that the illness I'm currently fighting was from the salad bar. I was the only one in my family that ate it and I'm the only one praying for the pain to stop. If I had to pinpoint the culprit, it was probably the ranch dressing. 

That being said, with the previous issues we've had and my current situation, we'll never frequent another Jason's Deli."}
{"text":"I love Jason's Deli but I haven't visited this one before (I can't believe I didn't visited this one until the last week of exams). I know the menu inside out and know how it should come out. So I was disappointed when my chicken pot pie in a bread bowl came to my table cold (not even lukewarm). It didn't even connect until half way done (studying and all).

But they're really accommadating. I didn't have to argue or plea my case. They simply took it back and just gave me a new order of my hot soup.

Verdict: I'll still come back. Great customer service and food."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great family type restaurant. Very nice selections. Had the Lobster Bisque soup which was excellent and at a very fair price. Actual pieces of lobster in it. You have to try the baked potato!  The potato is the size of a small football and very well cook. All meals come with a free mini soft ice cream cone. Going back tonight for some more soup and the salad bar."}
{"text":"This place has consistently good food on EVERY visit. Lots of choices and really fast service! Lucky to have this so close to work. Check the soup and sandwich combo. Salad bar rocks too."}
{"text":"This was my all time favorite place to go before I moved to California. I use to go to the one located in Chandler but it was a bit of a way, I was ecstatic to find out they were opening one in Gilbert near me at the time.

There are so many items to choose from, you have your standard deli selection of sandwiches along with paninis and wrapinis (sandwich wrapped in a tortilla and grilled) or the huge muffeletta(s). You can choose from a variety large salad plates or you can choose the salad bar. There's soup, pasta, plus a soft serve area. One of my go to items I get when I can't seem to choose is the Spud of Broc potato W/chicken, this isn't your average baked potato, this thing is HUGE and quite filling.  
Oh how I wish they would open one near me in the Bay Area."}
{"text":"Really enjoying this new Jason's Deli location! Food is amazing, aside usual. The atmosphere is warm and comfortable. Service is friendly. The to go service is very convenient. I ordered on the app and it worked perfectly. Highly recommend the broccoli and cheese soup!"}
{"text":"Love the salad bar. For take out you can't beat the loaded baked potatoes. Gigantic. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Dissapointed that they got ride of their military discount. Especially for those military retirees. One of my favorite sandwich places but discontinuing something that's been in place for years is a bummer."}
{"text":"Nom! My mom is obsessed with Jason's Deli and dines here on the reg [so much that a few of the employees and one of the manager's knows her face]. So naturally when she loves a place I have to check it out myself. She rarely orders a sandwich as we're salad bar lovers but enjoys them occasionally. If it's not terribly busy you can pay and start piling on the salad goods in a few minutes. Sometimes the lunch line will go outside the door, especially around 12/1p daily. 
The salad bar goods are always fresh - appears that the employees refresh low items every few minutes. I'm kind of sad they don't offer some type of proteins [chicken, pepperoni, etc], but there are lots of choice toppings [Italian tomato/mozzarella salad, olives, quinoa], as well as quality lettuce greens [more than cheap iceberg]. They also have superb softserve fo' free fo' anyone -- definitely a cherry on any great lunch there!"}
{"text":"Typical service and food from a Jason's Deli! Quick lunch option on the go. Parking can be difficult during business lunch hours."}
{"text":"To be fair, I didn't have a choice in what I ordered at Jason's Deli. I was simply handed a spinach veggie wrap for lunch (part of the perks of working in an office where luncheons are pretty frequent). If I was to walk in Jason's Deli on my own, I would've ordered the Caprese Panini, Grilled Cheese & Tomato Soup Combo, Black Bean Taco Salad, or the Zucchini Garden Pasta from the awesome Vegetarian Menu offered at Jason's. Pretty much anything BUT that wrap. So, please take my review with a grain of salt. 

SPINACH VEGGIE WRAP: The wrap just wasn't my cup of tea. Not that it was bad, but I don't really like anything with onions or guacamole on it. Besides these ingredients, there was loads of spinach, mushroom, tomatoes, and cheese. I liked that the take-out meal came with a side of salsa, a bag of organic tortilla chips, and an individually wrapped pickle. So cute.   

Worth a return visit?
My take-out lunch was my first experience at Jason's Deli. I'm definitely intrigued by the vegetarian menu, and look forward to trying Jason's on my own terms.

{"text":"If you love deli food or love great sandwich's you will love Jason's Deli. I love all the wraps the best and the fresh veggies too."}
{"text":"Im not from Arizona,  im from Texas. I was sick in my hotel so I ordered soup. Online delivery closed at 6pm so I ordered doordash. It was my first time using doordash. On the app it showed Jason Deli had my food ready, and Luis M my door dasher was there. Luis called me and said that the manager told him he could not take my order because others have no showed the meal and the company had to eat the cost. He told my driver if he pays for someone else's meal that no showed along with mine he would let me have it. That was very inappropriate. Luis cancelled my order and sincerely apologized. I contact Jason Deli and spoke with Anthony the manager I started to inform him about what happen and he cut me off saying\" we no long take door dash cause they never show up\" I tried to explain that my payment was added and that I was a guest at a resort with no car. I couldn't even tell him that I was sick. He went on, and on on how I can have someone come get it and he wasnt giving it to door dash or did he make the food yet. Which the app said he did. I informed him that I was not from here and I should have at least got a phone call about the order. He said \"hold on\" and clicked over with out my response."}
{"text":"I have has Jason's before at catered luncheons and always enjoyed it,  but never ate in. Salad bar is a five! Very well stocked with everything you could want! However, I ordered the Mediterranean Wrap and it wasn't very good. The tortilla wrap was too thick/firm and the filling seemed meager. I wouldn't order it again. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Not friendly and not welcoming at all. Very discriminatory against persons such as myself. I was turned away at the door.  It is a shame as I work very close to the store. But they don't want my business. Oh well."}
{"text":"Our first time having lunch at Jason's deil with the family. Food and service was amazing. Very kid friendly. I highly recommend Jason's deli if you're in the area. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really like the Salad Bar, everything is fresh and they are always making sure the items are well stocked. They have iceberge lettuce, mixed greens and spinach to choose from, with a lot of different sides, toppings and dressing.

The prices for their entrees are reasonable for the portion you get. I love that they also have a \"lighter\" option available, basically a smaller portion... which if perfect because I don't want to waste food and can't always take the leftovers with me.

The service is good, I am acknowledged once I step in the door."}
{"text":"I love this place for their salad bar! It has everything i want! It's easy to get up and get more plus their cleanliness of returning a dirty plate to grab seconds with a new one is comforting. The staff doesn't seem like they want to be there much, but the food is good. I've never had any issues with it, which is why i keep returning."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find a Deli with gluten free options (besides salad!). I had the GF bread and it was tasty. The kiddos got mac and cheese and pizza. The hubby had the pastrami. All very good. The FREE ice cream didn't hurt either"}
{"text":"We are the 2nd table asking for our money back. Food and service was horrible. I heard more negative comments from my fellow diners than positive. Normally not our experience at Jason's. Not sure if new management and staff, but will not be revisiting this location again."}
{"text":"Hair. Bleeeeh! The most dreaded sight while dining in a restaurant. I ordered the turkey sandwich and low and behold I go to take my first bite and there is a medium length black hair inside of it. I was so bummed. It was my first time dining there and the food looked so great. The food runner who had brought me my food came back by and asked me if I was doing okay (obviously I had quite a facial expression), I then told him of the hair. He cringed. He quickly scurried off to get a manager.

A very apologetic manager swooped in and swiftly apologized. I smiled and told her it wasn't obviously done on purpose, but pushed the plate towards her so she would \"make it go away\". She took the hint and picked it up and asked if I \"wanted something else instead\". I was starved as I hadn't eaten all day, but I was so sketched out by the h word, I just wanted to run out of there. I just politely declined, and she said she would go refund me my money and return shortly. While I waited I spotted the crowd around the salad bar. I wished I had went that route. 

All in all: very nice people, food looked great, but hairnets people- hairnets!!"}
{"text":"I ordered some food for my staff and the dates got mixed up. The manager made it right and made sure we were on track and happy. Quality is always great :)"}
{"text":"This place is a GEM!

I was meeting a high school friend from lunch.
When she said deli I originally was skeptical and unimpressed, but when I got there I was pleasantly surprised.
I had a pot roast sandwich, moist and flavorful.  With the sandwich I got chips and a loaded baked potatoes soup- all good choices.
What made my day was the free soft serve after- I mean how many places do you go and get free dessert?

It was reasonably priced, tasty, and the staff was a delight.

It isn't fine dining, but it's a comfortable school lunchroom feel kind of place.
It's like the Cheers Bar, but Deli Style- where everyone knows your name."}
{"text":"Went in and ordered a chicken panini. The staff was all very nice and helpful and explained how everything worked. They even came around to check on me while I was eating, so service was pretty top notch. I can't say I loved my sandwich, it was ok. I can't really say why though. Everything on it was good and I should have liked it more, but I didn't. I think the fault is with me though so I'm going to go back in the future and try something else and see if I like it better."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli is a reliable option when I'm looking for a quick, fairly healthy, no-fuss lunch. There's a great menu, including a variety of sandwiches, wraps, soups, salads, and their fresh, fully stocked salad bar. And you can customize these items as well - sandwich and soup, half sandwich and salad, etc. One of my favorites there is the Mediterranean wrap and I love that I can get a side of steamed veggies.The service is quick and friendly and the prices are fair. The dining room is huge with plenty of tables and booths.  Added bonus (which I try not to take advantage of too often, LOL): Free (yep, you read right, FREE) ice cream.  I'll keep coming back for a reliably delicious lunch!"}
{"text":"I ate here once so far, I thought it was pretty good.  I had the cheese sandwich and tomato soup it was good. The service was pretty quick. When we finished our meal, there was this really nice guy walking around and he took the plates for us.  The salad bar looked really good want to go back and try that, they do have a lot of different sandwiches and soups to choose from also.   Free small soft serve ice cream cones for everyone!"}
{"text":"I do not know why I haven't been here before, passed by many a time.  Glad I stopped by today.  I was very surprised of the deli setup, salad bar and all. 

I had their half sandwich and salad special.  The pastrami sandwich was delicious and the salad bowl was by far the largest side salad bowl I have ever seen.  The salad bar had all the fresh ingredients you come to expect. 

Afterward they have soft serve ice cream which was a delight.

I'll be back to try their soups and other hot sandwiches. 

Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"They know they were wrong for moving in next to Subway. 
I went over there because i glimpsed the subway sign & decided to go to Jason's instead. I can't be the only person to do this.

Service was great & I enjoy the foursquare special. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Great sandwich chain with many all-natural selections and excellent staff. I love their Cuban Panini and their Smoky Jack is to die for! Maybe a buck or two more than Subway but there is no comparison. They have never got a single thing wrong on any of my dozens of orders, and the food has always been ready ahead of schedule. Awesome place for lunch, and here's a good tip: they give free soft-serve ice cream!

Definitely worth a try if you want a great sandwich at a decent price."}
{"text":"I love this deli. It is always clean and the staff is really nice. We came in early and ordered to Reuben's, one with chips and one with a side of potato salad. We asked if the sandwich still came with pickles and the girl told us no. If we wanted pickles we would need to just take them from the salad bar. Hmm-- Okay. 

The food was served very fast and of course was very good. We did go to the salad bar to get the pickles. Kind of crazy that they would want everyone getting a sandwich that wants pickles to go to the salad bar. It seems like during the busy time this could cause a little chaos. But whatever, not my business.

I would normally give this place 5 stars but am forced to give 4 because of the employee dining situation. There were 2 other people in the restaurant eating besides us. The rest of the people were employees sitting in the booths having their break. It's fine if they don't have an employee break room, but the manager must tell the employees that if they are going to sit in the dining room, they can't sit out there and talk bad about the company and other employee's. They especially should not be sitting around using curse words. 

It just seems like common since to me. I just wanted to have a relaxing lunch with my dad and not listen to all of the problems going on at the deli."}
{"text":"Tried it again and this time they won me over. I really love their broccoli and cheddar soup along with their southwest chipotle sandwich. Although delivery is quick, its better to eat there as youll save on some cash, not deal with a minimum and apparently you get a free soft serve cone. Um, yes please lol Thank you :)"}
{"text":"Initially I thought that the UNLV area was lacking in good restaurants compared to other parts of town, but that is far from true. With so many university students around, this area caters to students who lack a large sum of money. There were three people in my party and our meal came out to roughly 17 dollars. 

They lack a menu board and once you look at the paper copy you will understand why. One of my friends almost cracked and cry under the pressure of finding what he wanted in the vast abyss of options. We had to tell two other groups to go ahead of us and then wing. He ended up getting egg salad and didn't seem too impress or disappointed. Another friend got the manager special, a half sandwich and soup combo. She also seemed satisfied. So you might ask why I gave it such a high rating. The reason, even though their sandwiches are nothing too spectacular, I love their salad bar. Although it is small, the selection of ingredients are high quality. The upkeep of vegetables are spectacular, giving the bar a vibrancy of colors. If  you are in search of a light lunch, you can order a side salad with a friend that is getting a sandwich because it only costs $4.49. Otherwise the $7.49 price is still a great deal for full reign over the whole bar.  When I want a sandwich, I will normally order the quarter turkey muff. This place is full of surprises, because a quarter is still humongous. It consists of a dense New Orleans' style muffaletta bread, topped with an olive tapenade, antipesti, and melted provolone cheese. For $6 and change, that is a steal."}
{"text":"I've finally made it to my friendly local Jason's Deli. I've been to others in the Las Vegas Valley, and I have to say in my opinion they have all rated equally in food and service. For a chain deli, its not bad. 
I always get the Fire Roasted Tortilla soup, I love it...spicy and flavorful, love when they crush extra chips on top! I even got a tip today from one of their employees, since the Fire Roasted Tortilla isn't on their menu every day, I should try the Southwest Chicken Chili. He says it's really similar.
I get their Chef Salad often too, loaded with deli ham, turkey and cheeses...good size salad for the price. I've tried many of their sandwiches...my favorite is probably the Beefeater, comes with Au Jus for dipping!
Free ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"Best salad bar in town IMO. hands down. Quality inredients, good Quinoa and quality oils and vinegars for the top. Not to mention at $7.99 its tough to beat.

All the sandwiches are pretty good too but the Salad bar is the star of the show for us."}
{"text":"If, like me, you have recurring  dreams about eating nothing but cake cones filled just to the rim with vanilla soft serve ice cream, Jason's Deli is your Mecca.  Buy a sandwich, throw it away and welcome yourself to vanilla cake cone heaven. Every meal @ Jason's Deli comes with all you can eat soft serve ice cream.  If you have no money or morals, you can just skip the buying a sandwich part and cut straight to the ice cream.

Other than the ice cream, Jason's Deli has some effing awesome tortilla soup.  I've only tried one sandwich there, and it was pretty good. Wish I could remember what it's called..."}
{"text":"Yummy food. :) Little on the pricey end but like the fact that you get unlimited free ice cream with your food and drinks."}
{"text":"This was an absolutely amazing place to bring a large group. Their service was outstanding. We had a group of 20 and food came super fast. Everyone greeted us with a smile. The managers we the friendliest and most accommodating. We had every food combination you could possibly have and they rocked it. Everything we ordered tasted amazing. They greeted us when we walked in the door. They right away brought crayons and coloring books for all of the kids. They fulfilled all the orders in record time. We are all in from out of town and they gave recommendations of where to take the kids as well. 
The one thing about Jason's deli is they are always consistent. They have food for everyone's liking.
Way to rock it Jason's Deli. Thanks for your outstanding service."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Jason's Deli before.  As I entered there is a large sign pointing where one should place a take out order, but no additional signage showing where those that are dining in should go.  After I figured it out and grabbed a menu, I ordered the penne pasta with meatballs.
The meal was brought out in a timely manner and to my pleasant surprise served on a real plate with real utensils, not disposable stuff.
This was an ample portion of pasta and meatballs.  Good taste and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I've got a history at JD's...  like the remodel.  Good deli, decent people and fairly quick service.  Lots of seating.  My visits have decreased over the years due to the decline in the meat quality of my steady ordering of thier Reuben the Great.  Salad was great this visit.  I'll be taking the Reuben out of the line up and go after the lean meats and wraps for future visits.  I've enjoyed this place enough in the past to keep it at a 4."}
{"text":"Always yummy. Always great service. Always fresh.  Love this place.  And a good value for your money. Love the seafood gumbo and salad!!!"}
{"text":"The California Club is life. I've loved Jason's Deli from afar for too long and am pretty sure it's time to come home...if only I could afford it regularly. My SO and I were blown away by how expensive this place was for the amount of food you get...it's a sandwich joint guys, not a sit down, napkin in lap, forks to the right place. Love the food but don't care much for the price to quantity of food ratio. This does not speak for the food however, it's delicious and the staff was very friendly and helpful! Will recommend to my richer friends."}
{"text":"Hubby's family is from New Orleans, so we're always on the prowl to find any place OUTSIDE of the Crescent City who can at least replicate some our fave NOLA foods. To that end, when we visited Hubby's aunt (born and raised in NOLA), she made it her mission to find a place in Scottdale/Phoenix that served something close to what they could get in the South. For some reason, she fixated on muffalettas, which Hubby LOVES...he ALWAYS stops at Central Market to get his fave there every time he visits the kin back in NOLA. But I digress...

This lunch was all about the muffaletta (which, sadly, I don't like because I don't like olives and that necessary olive mix concoction that is a key component of any muffaletta). So, Hubby, aunt, and uncle all ordered the 1/2 muffaletta and cup of spicy seafood gumbo. Happily, they all declared it a success! Yay for them (to their credit, Jason's Deli has a ton of sandwich options, and I thoroughly enjoyed my turkey/ham croissant sandwich). The 1/2 muffaletta was HUGE (a lot was boxed up to eat later!), and was a bit different because they toasted the bread, but it was still delicious, and aunt liked that the olive mix wasn't as oily as it is in NOLA. Oh, and the gumbo got the thumbs up as well (even though Hubby's mom makes some kick-ass gumbos, so it couldn't quite match up, but was deemed very close).

Sadly, there are no Jason's Delis here in Sacramento :( However, as our aunt/uncle had never been to Jason's prior to our visit, it seems like they have found themselves a new place to eat! :)"}
{"text":"Decent food. It's hard to get light healthy food around here. I do wish the salad were a bit more fresh. The blonde manager shouldn't be managing anything other than her attitude. Other than that it's good. I do like the tall heavyset guy that works here he's a sweet heart. Also, the Black tall guy, he's incredibly sweet!"}
{"text":"This is one of my families usual places for a quick dinner out.  The kids Alfredo bowtie pasta with chicken is a nice change from the staple Mac and cheese.  Not knocking it though, the Mac and cheese is extra cheesy and a favorite!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a quick lunch that wasn't fried food, and when this Jason's location popped up on the map, we were sold. I've been a fan of Jason's for years, with their extensive menu and great salad bar, I've always liked this place for a \"lighter\" lunch. 

This Jason's is located in the bottom corner of an office building, so it's clearly catering to corporate America, however if you plan on making a trip and don't work in the office building, you should know the attached parking garage is $3/half hour. I would recommend walking from another location if possible, but it sounded good so I paid to park!

The interior resembles every other Jason's I've been to, same decor and layout. You order at the counter, the salad bar and drinks are located more towards the middle and then there is plenty of seating. It was probably 1:30pm by the time we arrived on a Monday, so it was pretty dead, but I would imagine they get a lot of traffic during lunch hour from the businesses upstairs. 

Friendly staff working, and the food was on par with what I expect from Jason's. I had a tuna melt with fruit as a side, and my girlfriend ordered the penne pasta with marinara sauce and meatballs. They delivered the penne pasta with chicken and a white sauce, but upon bringing it to their attention they were apologetic, kind and replaced it very quickly. A+ customer service. 

I'd recommend this place if you are close by and want a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Love love love Jason's deli when I want a sandwich for lunch. Not only is the food great, the selection of items is vast, not to mention they have a great salad bar as well as free ice cream. The people who work here are super nice as well. From the managers to the bust boys, everyone is kind and willing to help you out in any way they can. Bathrooms are always clean when I've used them and they're quick to clean tables off even when it's busy."}
{"text":"Always good! Love the sandwiches and the salad bar!  Yum! We always come on Sunday's and have no problems... Friendly staff and clean environment! We'll be back again!!"}
{"text":"This location of Jason's offers the same deli sandwiches, soups and awesome salad bar as other Jason's.  All very good.  What sets this location apart from other Jason's and nearly every other restaurant in the country is the service.  It is incredible!  I'm giving it 5 stars because the service is that great.  You will never find this level of attention to customer service in another fast-casual restaurant, I guarantee it.   

You will really enjoy dining here.  The staff will assure it!   If only other business could be run like this Jason's."}
{"text":"Our lunch was fresh and fast! Husband ordered the Club Royale with steamed veggies, I had the Papa Joe sandwich. Both were delicious, and the free soft serve at the end was definitely a plus! We'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"There's a huge variety of healthy sandwiches, soups and salad here at Jason's Deli. I tried the Chicken Panini which comes with a side of regular or baked chips. The sandwich filled me up but it wasn't as flavorful as I hoped it would be. Maybe next time I will try a different sandwich. I enjoyed the complimentary muffins and ice cream though!"}
{"text":"How could you not like this place? You make your own salad. So I don't even have to go into detail about the salad bar. But I will say I LOVE the papa joe sandwich here. It has a lot of flavor. I was full for a good while but it doesn't take much for me. I used to love their egg salad sandwich but I think they took it off the menu. Sad day. Lol."}
{"text":"My mom introduced me to Jason's Deli as she compared it with one of NY's finest delis (Katz). 

Well I needed to see with all the hoopla was about so we ventured to Jason's for an afternoon lunch. 
To my surprise the menu was fantastic with lots of choices as well as a fresh salad bar. 
The sandwiches were freshly made right in front of you and mine was delicious! 

The sandwiches and the pickles were a little smaller than Katz but the price was a whole lot less so overall I was very satisfied with my Jason's deli lunch and in the words of the Terminator \"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"Okay, so this was one place everyone seemed to LOVE going too when I was at Euphoria. Personally, I was always under the impression that it was just another version of Panera. BORING.

Oh how wrong I was. It's not boring. At all. A million ways to slice and dice your sandwich? They make their own chips? And a salad bar too? I almost forgot this was a chain for a second. 

Now I was hoping the salad bar was free with the order of a sandwich, but nope. That's a separate meal altogether. Now personally, I find that rather counterproductive seeing that there's not much to it in the first place. The end of the salad bar is the exception. You're allowed to eat crackers and garlic crostini while you wait for your food.

Speaking of food, I decided to order the Meatball sandwich. If there's one thing I love, it's a good Meatball sandwich. Definitely goes in the top five of my comfort foods. And crazy as it sounds, I must say, the Meatball Marinara from Subway is my personal favorite, with the Meatball sandwiches they used to serve at the grill at CSN being the runner up. I must say though, the Jason's meatball sandwich definitely blows both of those out of the water. Strongly seasoned, with sauce dripping out of the bread and oozing with cheese. If it wasn't almost $9.00, I'd swear off of Subway forever. 

I'd always be down for that Meatball sandwich, but like I said previously, there's a million ways to slice and dice your sandwich here, which means there's definitely some exploring that needs to be done. 

The Final Verdict

Pros:
Menu has a large variety
Quality ingredients
Not like Panera (which was what I was expecting)

Cons:
Kind of steep
The set up of the salad bar pricing

Return Factor: 10/10, especially since I live in the area now"}

{"text":"My first visit to Jason's deli was average. But my second visit to Jason's deli was phenomenal. The employees gave great customer service, especially joseph, and the food was delicious. I would absolutely go back to this deli and plan on doing so. 
Thanks for the good service."}

{"text":"Went here with coworkers and ex coworker during the work week.
Jason's has huge sandwiches, and everything seems to be fresh. 
I had a cup of red beans and rice and salad bar. The salad bar has a large selection and was refilled when ever any items were empty.  This is my new fave place for: sandwich's, all you can eat salad bar."}
{"text":"First time visitor to restaurant, but have used catering many times from this location.  Everything is always fresh and tasty.  The order is always accurate.  I had to pick up our order today due to time, and one of the managers offered to help carry out my packages.  Many thanks for politeness and for caring."}
{"text":"Spotless restaurant; friendly faces; thanks Thomas for the great parking tips!  Salad bar contained fresh food and kept well stocked."}
{"text":"Holy Hell, I love Jason's Deli.

I try not to cover too many chain restaurants for my reviews, because it would be like writing that one Burger King is substantially different from the other 10,000 Whoppers you've eaten in your lifetime, but let me reiterate: I LOVE Jason's Deli.  So much so that if I were feeling more \"LEET\" at the moment, I would place a \"Less Than\" symbol followed by a number \"3\" after this declaration of affection, possibly adding multiple \"3\" symbols to really bring home the point that I'm steadfast in my affection for this place.

That said, I'm a soup and sandwich man.  This has a little bit of a New Orleans flair with muffalettas and gumbo, but there are all kinds of soups and sandwiches here.  Their broccoli/cheese soup is to die for, but their other soups are no slouch.

The menu changes with specials.  They have their staples, but sometimes, you can get things like Frito Pie, which hits the spot, or some other sandwich treat.  The best route in the \"Manager's Special\", which give you a cup of soup, a half sandwich, chips, a pickle and a soda for about $10.  You won't starve on this meal.  If you're not feeling the soup/sandwich route, there's always the salad bar.

The staff has always been friendly, and the service has always been good.  I've yet to be disappointed, and I view going here as a \"treat\".  It's great comfort food whether it's hot or cold outside.

If you're on the fence about a good deli, this place is the real deal."}
{"text":"..a pleasant dining experience.  My favorite? -Their hard boiled eggs. Yep.  :)"}
{"text":"the Sandwich had too much mustard on it... place was empty and service was just okay.. no more kids eat free on wednesdays which was why i went there"}
{"text":"If I were grading this place on salad bar alone, I would say five stars! 
Service didn't make sense. I ordered the salad bar and a bowl of soup. My husband ordered a sandwich. I saw maybe 8-10 different employees all over the place. We were there for a super early 5:00 dinner. We had one order ahead of us, and yet I was nearly done with my salad by the time my husband's sandwich came out. 
The salad bar is really good. Salad bars aren't common these days but this one ranks high. I had the chicken noodle soup. Wow was it salty. It was a mix between can soup and homemade. Lol. I couldn't finish it because of how much salt was in it. Having a sit facing the workers behind the counter probably wasn't the best idea. Just seeing so many employees running around doing different things and prepping. Most not wearing gloves and those that did, touched various different things never changing their gloves. Ugh. 
Overall, I will probably be back. But for the salad bar. That's about it."}
{"text":"A little expensive but good, friendly and quick. Recently remodeled. Efficient and friendly staff. Comfortable spacing between tables. Plenty of booths. Great variety of foods. And, FREE soft ice cream with every meal. Excellent salad bar . Great soups. Clean restrooms."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go when everyone wants something different. Salad, soup, sandwiches, pasta, baked potatoes, sweets, etc. My family loves the salad bar. The gingerbread mini-muffins are awesome and there is a great selection of toppings. You even get a free soft-serve ice cream at the end. Everything always looks fresh, too. It's not fancy, but it's good food."}
{"text":"Out of many reasons to eat at Jason's del, one is they are  health conscious with their ingredients. They use to be very adimate about changing to the better and would advertise that. Lately, I have not seen any table toppers or posters advertising how healthy their foods are. It makes me question weather they still vow to keep it ingredient safe or maybe it's under new ownership. I went in today to eat and wanted to check on their au jus sauce but unfortunately they did not have a book with the ingredients nor did they online. For a company to be well invested in providing healthy food you would assume they would have that readily available like the Haagen Daz ice cream shop. But that's not the only reason for the four star. The drop to a 4 star is mostly because they use the microwave for a lot of their food especially the kids meal. I mean come on,   most companies who go healthy knows microwaves are horrific! Jason's Deli, don't market healthy and then use the microwave...apple and oranges. They dont go hand in hand. You may fool the average Joe but for people who actually understand health your not fooling anyone."}
{"text":"Always loved Jason's Deli. Been visiting since 2001, frequenting the location in Summerlin in Boca Park. They never let me down with the selection of vegetarian meals.

This location is pretty nice. Love coming here for lunch. The Zucchini Grillini and Spinach Veggie Wraps are my go to meals. Always a great experience. The staff here is great and I love that they come to your table with your food and come to pick up your plates afterwards. Note, this is like a sit down restaurant experience outside of having to stand in line to order. So, I try and leave a tip at the table when possible for the table service. Also love the option of a free ice cream cone after lunch, if you so desire. 

I recommend this location. Great sandwiches and great service. Thumbs up from this guy!"}
{"text":"I would have to agree with most of the other reviews here other then the fact that I am giving 4 stars which is apparently like a unicorn to this location. I usually order the salad bar if I am eating in the restaurant and I do have to give credit to them that every time I have been there the vegetables and salad fix-ins have all been very fresh and full. 

As far as the sandwiches are concerned, they are delicious and they have a ton of healthy and unhealthy options which I feel is essential to any good restaurant. This is obviously not a place that I tell my out of town guests is a must but it is a great place for a fast lunch on the go with many many options."}
{"text":"Every time we have ordered lunch from Jasons they have come through no doubt. The wraps and sandwiches are always fresh and made with real quality ingredients and i have never had a bad experience. 

Today was no different. I did not want a large lunch and was not really that hungry so I ordered the Fresh Fruit plate, It came with the perfect amount of Cantaloupe, strawberries and pineapple. All the fruit was fresh, sweet and perfectly chilled. 

The other nice thing that Jasons offers that some other delis near my place of employment do not offer is delivery. Jasons delivered our lunch at the scheduled time with no issues.  If you want a healthy meal or a heavy burger for lunch this place is for you, they have food for everyone at a great price. 

If you pay attention to my recommendations, add this one to the list."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, the food is good, big menu selection, tells you nutrition info, and the staff are always really friendly.  My favorite lunch place."}
{"text":"My first time here. It was average I suppose nothing to brag home about. I has the salmon-which with fruit. I think it was almost $12 for a small sandwich with fruit and drink just for myself. To me it's a bit pricy definitely more bread than salmon. I would not have mind paying if the portion was bigger. If I return I will definitely get something cheaper. The employees that passed me were however friendly."}
{"text":"Kids eat free on Mondays between 4:30 to close.  Food is great.  Kids meals are awesome and healthy.  Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"This location is close to one of my work sites and we often walk the 4ish blocks to eat here.  On my last visit I decided on the Salad Bar with a small side of the Chicken Salad.  The Chicken salad was good, finely chopped chicken, pineapple and slivers of almond,  and a bit of mayo.  I enjoyed the flavor and gave me a good idea for those times I do cook at home.  The salad bar...well it was 1130 before the lunch rush and several of the veggie buckets were practically empty and the rush had not even started.  I picked at what they had, which was all fresh.  I can also never pass up these Cracker Crisps they have there, pre-packaged and topped with pumpkin seeds. I find I seek a couple in my purse for my emergency ration.  LOL"}
{"text":"I Went to Jason's to pick up some of their delicious homemade potato salad.  I had the nicest and most pleasant Manager wait on me.  
Great customer service.  Fresh food and huge sandwiches. All soups are homemade and yummy.



I am and will continue to be a loyal customer.
It is always better to talk to a manager, rather then write a negative review."}
{"text":"I love this place.  GO bread, fresh ingredients.  

CONS:  service is slow.  Last two visits we waited 20+min for our sandwiches.  Watching the kitchen, they have a, back up of sandwiches to be table delivered.

PRO:  Mgr came out to our table to discuss GF options.  Love the personal tough.

I give them 4 stars for food, but 1 star for slow service to table."}
{"text":"I love food, I love sandwiches and I'm a huge fan of Jason's Deli.   I've been going to this location since they opened liked 3 years ago.   

Today's visit did not disappoint.  I had the Beefeater, a huge mound of roast beef and provolone on a french roll with a side of Au jus.  For dessert strawberry shortcake, fresh strawberries, real whipped cream on a yellow cake.  Everything was fresh and wonderful.   As I always do I was overstuffed and regret not just getting half a sandwich.  I had their sweet tea to drink and that is always really good.

My usual favorite is the Portabello Wrapini which is over the top good.  It's a little spicy but the flavors just make you want more.  

With each sandwich you also get a choice of regular or baked chips.  

If you are ever in Mesa and want a good sandwich I recommend them for both lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"This is my first time ever posting because I don't publicly complain, but  something has to be said here. Just went through drive-thru. Kids chicken nuggets were ice cold, like they just came out of refrigerator and not heated up at all. Same with kids Mac n cheese. Side of fruit that came with the kids meal came in a large plastic cup, but literally only had 4 pieces of fruit: 2 tiny strawberries and 2 very small pieces of cantaloupe.  Very disappointed. You'd think with waiting for 5 minutes in drive-thru that hey could have taken the time to heat the food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, had one good experience and one bad experience.

First time I had the premium ham & hard salami muffaletta and I liked it a lot, except the salt in the sandwich was really overwhelming.  I'm not sure if it was the olive salad or the meat itself that made it so salty, but I still enjoyed it regardless.  Later, I had the turkey muffaletta at another location and loved it and was not salty, so I think it was the meat.

Second time I had a BBQ brisket sandwich and I really didn't like it.  The brisket was dry and the entire sandwich just had an off flavor.

This is a good place to have a quick lunch, but be mindful that their menu items are hit and miss."}
{"text":"Had lunch to go and it was ok. they made me a tuna-fish in a wrap and it was a decent lunch. They did look to have a decent salad bar and I think I woudl do that if I ever went in again"}
{"text":"This isn't there fault but I guess there's an local ordinance on big signs or signs in general. If your traveling there's no way your going to find it really your not looks like it's in a house. But once your inside it's really nice and the Reuben was really good plus it's really big. The salad bar looks good and you can get unlimited pickle Spears. I still think a Ruben with chips for$10.99 is a little pricey but it was filling"}
{"text":"I have never actually stepped into a Jason's Deli but we get it all the time at work for catered lunch.  I have actually resorted to bringing my own lunch on those days.

I think their boxed lunch is THE WORST!  First of all, how can they charge what they charge for a simple sandwhich that I could easily make myself in less than 2 minutes?  This is not 'artisan' bread like Paradise Cafe bakes.  It is simple, flat, square sandwhich bread that looks like it came out of a commercial loaf at the grocery store.  Throw on some shaved lunch meat, a tomato slice and head lettuce slice and your done.  Then throw some mustard and mayo packets into the box with a bag of chips.  To top it off, throw in a cookie that is not only flavorless, but so hard and dry that I nearly cracked a tooth on it...and then charge four times what I would pay to make this myself.  I am not sure if they have better selections or food besides this standard boxed lunch as I have never been impressed enough to check it out."}
{"text":"Jason's deli is a chain that opened its 2nd location in the Pittsburgh area. The first one is in Cranberry Twp. Upon arrival I was greeted warmly and told that all customers are entitled to free soft serve ice cream. They have on the side of the room where you can either serve yourself in a small dish or cake cone.

They have a drive through and preordering is available. I saw that if you download their app then you would get $5.00 of your check. The hostess helped me with the menu and went over pairings of soup and 1/2 sandwich or if you want to add the salad bar. The salad bar is slightly extra for one trip and you pay $1.00 more over that if you want unlimited trips.

I went over to look at it. It has two sections. One is your traditional salad bar fare and the other section offers various desserts. Everything lists calorie counts if that is important to you. They have a good selection of different wraps, sandwiches, and salads. They also serve muffalettas of which the bread is made out of an olive mix. They do catering as well. They have some vegetarian options to choose from. You can even build your own sandwich. Salad bar can be purchased on its own.

I decided to go with the spinach veggie wrap. You get a choice of chips or a selection of fruit. I chose the fruit. I ordered a small drink and was given a 24 ounce paper cup! That's pretty big for a small! Nevertheless you are given a number and then told to sit anywhere.

The place is pretty big so there's plenty of room to sit. Drinks are self serve through machines and you can get whatever you need to go with them. By the time I got my drink my food was already at my table.

My wrap was good but I noted that the edges were dry. The hostess came around to see how I was doing and I mentioned that to her. I later learned that they toast their pita bread which gives it the hard edge to it. She offered to get me another one but I declined since I was pretty full from this one. 

I would say this food is average as a whole. This deli is located near Aldi's in the block of Northway shops which is still not completed. They also have an online menu which I haven't tried."}
{"text":"Learn to wrap your food correctly. If you break the wrap and mess up, cool, make a new one. I know what this wrap is supposed to look like and this isn't what I paid for... Yet I've been charged for it. I'd like to know what your establishment is going to do to right the lazy work shown by staff members."}
{"text":"We had just gotten to phoenix and it was late so wanted something light.  Came to Jason's Deli for a salad, we chose the salad bar and wasn't disappointed.  Everything was fresh even at 8 at night.  Will return for a lettuce wrap sandwich maybe another day.  We are eating Keto and this was perfect!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Jason's. I cannot get enough of their pasta at the salad bar or that California club. Everytime I've gone the staff has always been friendly and they engage in small talk so I love that. It feels like a friendly family place. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because since I frequent the salad bar so much, I notice that the apples are not always fresh. And I love apples with a passion. Luckily though when you order the fruit cup, the fruit is always fresh and juicy."}
{"text":"If you want a quick lunch, healthy or filled with calories, this is the place for you.  Their food is always fresh, try the new pork tenderloin sandwiches.  Super tasty and healthier than some of the other meats.  The staff is always friendly and most of them recognize me after only a handful of visits.  The soups are great too and they have a larger variety than most sandwich shops including chile and chicken pot pie soup.  

They have a salad bar with fresh ingredients and even give free muffins and crunchy garlic toast out free to all customers.  The soft serve ice cream is also included in your meal if you dine in.  

The price is reasonable and the portions are just right. Goldilocks would be pleased. not to big, not to small."}
{"text":"Love this chain, they have always been consistant place to place and they have one of the largest portions of premium meats on their sammy's I had anywhere. The prices are always reasonable, the salad bar is amply suppied with the things I dig most and I have to say the final get me in there reason I go is for the free all u can eat soft serve icecream, choc van and swirl how could u go wrong here, especially if you have kids. I use this place as a carrot to get my kids to do things for.me like behave or do chores. Works like a charm!!

If you have never been u've been missing out for sure,  try it and see if it dont become a staple stop next time!"}
{"text":"What an amazing value!  Great spot for a quick lunch break. Sandwiches are very large and taste great.  NOT you ho-hum Subway.  Many times I've only had room for half my sandwich and take the rest to go and eat later. Even though it's more of a cafeteria style place several staff stopped at our table to be sure we didn't need anything more."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. There isn't much to say that already hasn't been said.

My food tasted extremely fresh and was filling. 

I didn't care for the chips and the wait time was a little on the longer side."}
{"text":"This restaurant has good food but took way too long for food to be made. Some people waited for 25 minutes even though others who ordered in front already got their food. They also ran out of chicken at 2 pm..."}
{"text":"I went into Jason's Deli for lunch and was contemplating which sandwich I was in the mood for.  The guy behind the counter (Evans) helped customize the Beef Eater and turned it into a mouth watering delicatessen.  The thing that made the best impression on me was the OUTSTANDING customer service I had received from Evans. Every now and then you find that person who is extraordinarily helpful and kind. This guy deserves major kudos. Best customer service I've received in a long time!  I will be back :) Maybe they can change the name to Evans Deli!"}
{"text":"I love Jason's and was on the way home and hungry so I figured I would stop in at this new location and pick up my favorite taco salad!  I was welcomed right when I walked in and proceeded to order.  The cashier was very nice and very upbeat.  I was taking my order to-go but the place was very clean and warm.  I think I only had to wait 5 minutes before it was brought out to me.  The girl who brought it out was also very nice and upbeat.

Once I got home and ate the taco salad, it was everything I wanted and more!  I really can't say anything bad about it.  I see from other reviews that the customer service hasn't been great but I did not have a problem with it and again my food was made right.  Definitely will be back and recommend others do the same.

Oh yah, the cashier told me I have a beautiful signature, ha-ha!"}
{"text":"So, yes. I want to up my rating, but not by much.  As mentioned in my previous review I am a fan of Jason's Deli and frequent other locations as well.  However, based on the fact I work uptown this location is my option.  I love the large menu and have been trying different soups and sandwiches and have enjoyed them all, even though some weren't right.
So, along with my original review, they still have an issue with errors on take out and call ahead orders, but have gotten better.  I have enjoyed my dine-in visits and again love the options available. I think anyone can find something on their menu!
Will continue to visit, but be sure to check my orders better so I don't end up back and my desk to only realize my order was wrong, which has happened to me."}
{"text":"I would love to give them a 3.5, here's why. On a Sunday afternoon, this place was packed! With that said the wait time was a little long, but not a major issue. However, once we were seated, we were delivered the wrong order.  Very quickly they fixed the issue and the Manager came by to ask how the meal was, that is a plus. The tuna melt was amazing. The salas bar has a lot to offer, but the broccoli cheddar soup, the soup choice of the day, was very heavy. I am still a Panera fan when it comes to broccoli cheddar soup! Overall it was good, and the ice cream at the end is a special bonus."}
{"text":"Little bit of a wait but well worth it!! I got a turkey wrap with steamed veggies. Absolutely delicious. The wrap flavorful and well dressed except for a rather tasteless guacamole. The veg was steamed to perfection, hot and tasty. I eat at Subway a lot but this will be my fast food first choice if it's available!"}
{"text":"i came sat evening they were very busy but they handled customers very well I was amazed how they can manage with the way they were jammed very happy and employee very friendly and helpful my order came with no time A++ keep pounding Jason deli E. Woodlawn"}
{"text":"Busy on a Friday but still able to get a booth table. Fast service and good sandwiches and sweet tea."}
{"text":"Love Jason's!

I wish the food tasted the same on each visit. I always order the same thing, 70% of the time no problem, but the other 30% a problem. If the food consistently stayed the same I would give this 5 stars!

On our last visit, my French Onion Soup was so salty I could barely swallow it. Now I don't understand why this happens! I love french onion because I love to dip my sandwich in it. But this time I was left very disappointed :(

The store always seems very clean and the staff does seem nice.

Another complaint at this one, is that the cleaning staff is always cleaning around the area I am eating. This is a MAJOR Pet PEEVE of mine! I am eating, please clean AFTER I walk away from the table!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Jason's, but I do think this location needs some TLC.

The food is very good, never had anything I didn't enjoy.

The decor and cleanliness need a lot of help. The floor was very dirty, almost like the tables are wiped right onto the floor. 

The beverage area was a little misplaced, maybe some more attention there would benefit.

Over all good, but not great.

Will come back and review again."}
{"text":"This might be petty, but. I worked at a store in the plaza that this deli is in, and they wouldn't give me a discount, not even on a cup of coffee. 
The way the employees are too is a little weird. They remind me of the children of the corn.
I've never been to a Jason's deli, and I'll never come back to one.
Oh yeah, I forgot they ID'd me for a $1.50 cup of coffee when I used my card to purchase it- which was pretty weird."}
{"text":"Terrible to-go service! Second time I have been here for to-go orders. Both times the orders were delayed. The first time the employees were apologetic and tried to make the best of it. This time they were rude, said there was a system error and didn't even apologize. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Great food, but took a really long time to make a child's grilled cheese during a time when they weren't busy."}
{"text":"This place is a decent fast restaurant. I went here last night to pick up dinner with the BF. After much deliberation, he got a turkey sandwich and I got the soup and sandwich combo with the chicken pot pie soup and the chicken panini. The soup was good and the chicken they use in it is white meat, which I thought was a nice touch. The sandwich was far less good. The meat tasted like it had been cooked long ago and frozen or something and the sandwich just wasn't very flavorful or fresh tasting. The BF's sandwich was alright, but he was a bit miffed that they charge 50 cents for cheese.... not so cool. The people who worked there were nice enough, however, and they gave us each a pickle, which was nice. This wouldn't be my number one place to go get a sandwich, nor would I ever crave the food from here, but it's ok. If you want to eat some ok food, this place will do."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch because the last time I was here I was very happy. 
 I ordered a Cesar salad with extra chicken and no bread or croutons.  I really couldn't tell if there was extra chicken or if it was the normal portion. Also the salad was loaded with croutons. I really hate picking stuff out of my food but this is what I had to do today. 
 
Unfortunately I can't give a better rating because I didn't get what I ordered and I wasn't really happy how the salad tasted as well. Such a shame since my last time here I was so happy."}
{"text":"We have always liked Jason's for the food and the portions, however this last time was just a bit disappointing. When asked about something on the menu, the girl taking our order simply responded with, \"I dunno\" as opposed to offering to find out or asking someone else. When I took it upon myself to ask the manager how they sweetened their sugar free cheesecake, he had no clue either. The place was a bit dirtier and unclean at the salad bar and they actually \"ran out of forks.\" This is a restaurant people and they apparently had no more clean forks and salad bar users had to \"wait.\" Kids get a free meal on Monday nights from 4-9 PM. The food is good and good size portions, but we will probably try it again next time we're in Vegas and hope this past visit was just a bad day for them."}
{"text":"I hit this place up from time to time after my workout because it is located across the parking lot from the gym. I usually order the chicken club salad with the balsamic vinegar dressing. The décor is nice with hints of Vegas and the facility is pretty clean. The food looks healthy for the most part but some of their dishes push close to over 1500 calories. I have not tried their unlimited salad bar but it looks like it has a nice variety of toppings and dressings to choose from. However, if you're not concerned with calories, it is a nice spot to eat. Lots of room to cater for groups of four or more."}
{"text":"Awesome deli spot my brother in law took us to. This place is pretty awesome with food, the first time I went here I got the pastrami sandwich and boy was that good. There as more to the menu that I wanted to get, but since the sandwich already filled me up, I decided to come back here the next day and try their humongous baked potato that was loaded with bacon, sour cream and chives. On top of that me and the wifey shared the salad bar. That was good. My son ended up getting the pizza both times we came here. He liked it so much that he didn't wanna try something different the second time around.

I will sure be coming back here when I visit Vegas again and I will try something different along with getting the baked potato again."}
{"text":"Seriously, I've been here like, 10 times and I absolutelly hate it. My parents (cough, dad) used to insist on eating here because we used to live really close by. 

Every time I've gone, I've gotten the salad bar. Back in August, (I remember this because it was the same day Arkady G. left for the Phillipines)  I went and immediately came home, ran up the stairs and threw up twice. Whatever it is I ate was just not going to stay down. As well, I've tried my younger brother and sister's kid meals before and they were pretty bland. I'm not a fan.

I don't buy their \"everything is fresh and healthy\" line when you can see the meat in the deli case has soy protein isolate, barley malt (MSG) annato (msg) and natural flavoring (MSG) listed on the labels. Yeah, I look for that kinda stuff.

For whatever reason, they have a real problem keeping the bowls for the yogurt/ice milk/ice cream stocked. 

Oh, also, this place is always empty - 10,000 tables and they're very empty every time I've come by. For whatever reason, every time I've gone, I've suddenly gotten in a crap mood. I suspect this could be from some sort of food reaction. Who knows, there is just a \"vibe\" I can't explain. 

The staff is generally friendly so that is +1 star."}
{"text":"I only get the salad bar at Jason's Deli so I can't speak about their other foods.

I'm not sure why Jason's has enough seating for a Roman Legion and a single salad bar. Has this place ever been to capacity, and if so, WHERE did they all park?

Parking is a freaking nightmare because it shares the parking lot with a Wingstop and Seafood City and a few other businesses. 

In general, their salad bar is a great deal and I can't recommend their gingerbread bites enough. They are killer.

My beef with Jason's is that they slice all of their vegetables as if they're going to go on a burger, rather than dicing them, which can make eating a salad look pretty beast-like (imagine Beast eating porridge for the first time in Beauty & the Beast) if you accidently miss cutting a slice of bell pepper or onion completely before stabbing it with your fork."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong I love me some Jason's Deli but I was hoping they got their act together since our last visit (dirty restrooms & dining area) to our surprise it is very clean/remodeled now! Yay! 

The salad bar is always awesome, fresh and a wide variety of veggies. 

Pro tip: use the self serve checkout thingy - soup and salad bar kiosk, skip the line of people getting sandwiches and such.  

Don't forget your free soft serve cone on your way out!"}
{"text":"Good place to grab a bite to eat.  If its your first time there, the cashiers preach that you get their fabulous free ice cream (that instance soft server stuff).   

Lunch can get pretty busy but they get you your food pretty fast.  They also have a nice sized salad bar if you want to try their manager special of half a sandwhich and salad bar."}
{"text":"Turns out, there are some chain restaurants I do like - and Jason's Deli sits atop that rather short but awesome list. 

I've been in twice since my office moved to the Chandler area and its been a really pleasant experience. The folks that work there are some of the happiest people on Earth - asking if you've been in before, helping you through the menu and never making you feel rushed or unwelcome. The salad bar is awesome - full of fresh ingredients that the staff ensures remain filled at all times. There is also some mini muffins, crackers and free ice cream. 

The food is great, comes out quickly and the price is right. I got a half sandwich and a trip to the salad bar for under 10 bucks, very happy with my lunch yesterday. I'll be back in again to sample some more of their menu and of course get some more of that awesome salad bar."}
{"text":"We walked in around 3:30pm on a Thursday and they were, surprisingly, pretty busy.  It was chaotic and unclear where you were supposed to order.  The person actually taking orders was doing so over a deli counter, not at a register like you would expect.  My husband ordered the zucchini grilled sandwich (see below) and I added the side salad (1 trip to the bar - $4.79) for myself.  The salad bar at Jason's is great - everything is fresh, I love the hummus, and you get unlimited crackers, pickles and pepperocinis (which makes me happy).  That is the only reason I won't give this place 1 star.  Here is the breakdown about the rest of our experience:

We paid $7 for the craptacular \"zucchini grilled\" sandwich.  Here is a break down of the MENU description vs. what we actually got:

-Grilled zucchini - the zucchini, which made up the majority of the sandwich, was steamed and soggy, not grilled whatsoever

-muenster - we asked for no cheese and the sandwich came drenched in greasy cheese, so I had to ask for it to be remade which took over 10 minutes.  There was no apology for getting the order wrong and they seemed bothered to have to do it over

-organic spinach - there were only a few small leaves, barely noticeable

-red onions - there was an excessive amount of onions

-roma tomatoes - it had tomatoes, but they were not romas

-kalamata olives - there were a few olives

-roasted red pepper hummus - their hummus is tasty, but the sandwich came with a tiny dab

-toasted on 9-grain artisan bread - the bread seemed like a wheat bread from the grocery store, not \"artisan\"

We requested baked chips and got the regular kind. When we mentioned it, they brought a small cup with some baked chips in it

Overall, the food was overpriced, service was definitely lacking.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new Jason's location, behind Chandler Mall.  Jason's features a huge menu, huge portions of quality meats, breads, cheeses, etc.  Great soups & salad bar too.  Free soft-serve ice cream (yogurt?) for dessert too.  The standard accessory with sandwiches is a handful of potato chips.. well worthwhile to upgrade to fresh fruit (and they always have VERY good fruit), or potato salad (also very good).  Food delivery can be a bit on the slow side, mysteriously even at off-hours.  But other than that, it's all good.. a solid 4+ stars on the Brak-o-meter."}
{"text":"The sandwiches we got were all great!  I've already decided on what I'm going to order next time!!  The chips are nothing special, that was a bit of a let down. I thought they'd be something they baked, not just opened.  The sandwiches are amazing though!!!  

This is a definite must go to and repeat often!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I loved the chef salad and the portion size was perfect and the blend of toppings were perfect.  I went there with a group and all 14 of us were pleasant surprised with each of our food choices.  I recommend it for work meetings as they deliver."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were almost disappointed that they stop serving the French onion soup - but, our cashier Lexi was so sweet and awesome for referring us to their new beefeater with the Au jus sauce. So yummy!"}
{"text":"We on a Sunday around lunch time, there was a long line to order and about 15 minute wait for a salad plate, one sandwich and two kids meal. They brought out our food plus tried to deliver us someone else's food. The seating was tight, a row of chairs right against the salad bar making it difficult to get through the salad bar line."}
{"text":"Today I woke up a little hungry, not with a overwhelming appetite but wanting just enough. I decided to go to the Jason's Deli as I had heard positive reviews from family and friends. I was pleasantly greeted and was glad to be presented with a big variety of options. I would recommend Jason's Deli as it's simple, tasty, and the customer service is good."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner, the place was pretty empty.
Had a tuna melt and it was hella good.  But I think they are over priced"}
{"text":"Definitely not stingy on the meat! The hot corned beef and the baked potatoes are delicious ."}
{"text":"Stop at this deli on a late Thursday night. There were two customers sitting in the dining area. No other customers in line, I Ordered a wrap w/fruit. There were two servers re-stocking. After 15 minutes of waiting and trying to get someone's attention, they proceeded to prepare my wrap! really! 25 mins for a wrap w/fruit. Never again. Next time I will go to chompies next door!"}
{"text":"We ordered lunch for delivery from here today.  I had never, ever had a reuben in my life.  Never had sauerkraut, either!  A guy at work yesterday had a reuben and I just had to try it.
Deliver took forever.  I mean FOR-EVER!  
Sandwich was ok, if a bit soggy (could be from being wrapped so long during the delivery).  I was disappointed at the flavor, though.  Not much at all!
My co-workers had salads, and I wish I had gotten one, too.
It was an OK lunch, but I probably won't eat there again."}
{"text":"I thought this restaurant was a cool concept, like an Eat n Park meets Panera Bread. Not understanding why you only get 1 trip to the salad bar.. but the food was good and the staff was friendly, fast, and so accommodating! The free ice cream is a plus. Not a huge menu but definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I've eaten in this place several times. They have a great selection on their menu and the food is always fresh. The way they played the food makes you want to just gobble it up because it looks so beautiful. The service is outstanding and it is one of my favorite places to stop in. If somebody wants some fresh food and take out this is one of my favorite places to recommend."}
{"text":"We live very near this Jason's Deli, and we like sandwiches, so we really wanted this to be a good 'sandwich joint'. Having said that, 4 of 6 of our orders have been wrong in the past three months. The management is nice when we tell them of the mistakes, but mistakes keep happening. They range from getting 1/4th of the portion size to forgetting pickles and potato chips. Subway's sandwiches are not as good, but they are much cheaper, and they make the sandwiches right in front of you, so there are never any mistakes. No more Jason's!"}
{"text":"I enjoy going to Jason's Deli for lunch, love the build your own salad bar and free ice cream. Great place to grab some lunch, sandwiches or soup."}
{"text":"Had a rueben the other day. Great sandwich!  Tons of meat and kraut. Delicious and really filled me up!"}
{"text":"We went here a few weeks ago with a gift card my wife had from work. I've passed the place plenty of times on my way to and from Birkdale but never stopped for a bite. I don't know why I waited this long because it was a decent sandwich place, and somewhere I can see myself returning to when in the need to grab lunch on the go.

The inside is huge, with a few tables also placed outside. It's one of those places where you order at the counter and wait for the server to deliver the food, which is always a bit confusing at first for me. The menu is also pretty big, at least for a deli type place, and it took awhile to read through it and decide what I wanted. 

I decided to make get a \"Manager's Special\", which is similar to Panera's \"You Pick Two.\" I got 1/2 a Beefeater sandwich and a cup of tomato basil soup. The sandwich was pretty amazing despite the fact it wasn't Boars Head cold cuts. The roast beef was warm and juicy and I was really digging the au jus dipping sauce. The bread was also a great bread that worked well for a dipping sandwich. The soup was a different experience, and was very disappointing. It pretty much tasted like super sweetened pizza sauce, not tomato soup. The soup did nothing for me, and I'd be hard pressed to try another soup again. 

My wife went with the Plain Jane Baked Potato and really loved it. She got the 1/2 size and that was still gigantic...I couldn't imagine seeing the regular serving! 

Horrible soup aside, Jason's Deli was a decent place. While cumbersome the menu offered a variety of different lunch options that I wouldn't normally expect from a deli. Next time I'm in the mood for a sandwich I will probably hit this place up again to try some other tasty sammys."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I've been to Jason's Deli and I loved it! They have a great selection of items, sandwiches, salads, pastas, soups, even baked potatoes...pretty cool. 

I was surprised to see such a short lunch time, but I'm not complaining. I ordered the manager's special half wild salmon-which and cup of vegetarian tomato basil soup and a side of fruit. Not bad for $8.50 considering all the free goodie bar. I love the pumpkin flatbread crackers, loaded with protein but not calories. Perfect snack especially for work. The meal itself was satisfying and filling. There was a good piece of nicely seasoned salmon on crunchy ciabatta. The fruit was fresh with a little cup of sweet yogurt dipping sauce, so good! The soup was creamy and rich, I doubt it will be my go to soup but it was yummy. I think I will have to go with the vegetarian soup from here on out if I don't want to gain hella weight. 

The best part, free ice cream! You will never leave Jason's Deli hungry! We will be frequent customers from here on out. The new shrimp quinoa salad sounds interesting and yummy."}
{"text":"I just love Jason's Deli in general but, I really did enjoy coming to this location. The staff was very friendly and the food was very fresh. I ordered the manager's special with a half salmon sandwich, veggie soup, and fruit, my go to meal here. If you are ravaged don't worry, I like to nibble on a little gingerbread muffin or pumpkin cracker while I wait. The food came out piping hot and looking great, the veggies and fruits were so fresh. Its the perfect sized meal complete with soup and fresh fruit. The half salmon sandwich with avocado spread was delicious and filling. 

I like to treat myself to a mini sundae cone, drizzle with chocolate syrup and add almonds from the comp bar! Yum. I always leave here so stuffed. Great bang for your buck. 

The staff was extra happy and friendly, love it."}
{"text":"Michael the manager was awesome in everyway possible. My boyfriend and I came in pretty late and we were the only ones in the restaurant. He saw that I was cold and turned down the air conditioning for me. He made sure we were happy with our meal and in general he made me happy to be here. Nothing beats quality service with an awesome attitude."}
{"text":"Salad bar half empty , rotten lettuce, sandwich I got was good but salad bar was disgusting empty and took literally 20 mins to refill during peak lunch hours , unacceptable,"}
{"text":"Our office ordered a catering order at 8AM to be delivered at 12PM for a meeting and it is now 1PM. Very disappointed and very unprofessional to be late for another company. Sadly it was expensive and we will not be utilizing them again."}
{"text":"Its been a really long time since I had been to a Jason Deli and the last location I went to years ago had a much different look so they have certainly upgraded design and styles within but with the same cool fashion of ordering.

This location, located in Arroyo shopping area, has great parking among the other business and walking in you are quickly heading to the front order window. I did notice a self ordering system for Salad Bar Only so that's a cool little feature. 
The menu still supports great sandwiches, soups, salads, deserts, and main course bigger dishes. 
After getting your order in, take your number find a seat and they will bring your food. If you have an salad options, just walk up to the prep station and they will provide you with plates and go attack the salad bar which was well stocked and fresh on this day. 

the place was clean and tables got cleared fairly quickly. 
I was satisfied with Jason Deli upgrades and will certainly add them back on my list of places to eat. Don't forget the soft serve ice cream cone you get too!

Cheers"}
{"text":"I had a California club... came on a croissant which was surprising, but tasty.  Too much mayo. Chips were just plain Ruffles."}
{"text":"The salad bar tho, really good for the price!! So here's the trick you can pay the price of side salad and you can get whatever you want 1 time at the bar, with takeout order... the box size is awesome!! 

Now for the wraps, potion size is disappointing!! The wrap is so tiny for $8 

Full size turkey wrap- to me it's like kids meal size"}
{"text":"First time customer here tonight. I wasn't sure what to expect but it exceeded my expectations. I ordered online which was easier than most other places. Good menu selection and options. I ordered three different items two different sandwiches and a salad. I was prompted a 30 minute pickup time. Showed up in 30 sharp wasn't ready yet I don't think they had actually retrieved the order off their computer yet. I was told 7 mins and it was 7 mins. The staff was polite. Place looked clean and inviting the best part was the food it was very good. Sandwiches excellent salad was fresh too. My only complaint with the salad was more dressing was needed than supplied. I'll repeat for sure"}
{"text":"Great salad bar! And their baked potatoes are so big that one can feed a family of 4! Love going here!"}
{"text":"Stopped by the other day for lunch. The young man at the counter was so polite and had such a pleasant smile. I believe his name might have been Ivan (for sure started with an I). I've never had bad customer service here and on this particular day, this cashier just made my day and lunch was delicious."}
{"text":"Very good turkey reuben and smoked turkey panini.  I tried both, preferred the reuben.  They have good quality ingredients, and they give you free ice cream.  Also, we had great service."}
{"text":"I like Jason's Deli.  I get the half sandwich/salad bar combo (I'm more of a soup person usually, but I have really not liked any of the soups I have tried here), which is nice because while I'm waiting for them to make my sandwich I can run through the salad bar.  It's usually pretty neat and presentable - and I like the little garlic toasts and variety of crackers and things at the end that are available to everyone, not just people who get the salad bar.  

Only three stars because sometimes they forget an ingredient on whatever sandwich I order."}
{"text":"Have come here on and off for many years. They do a decent representation of a New York style delicatessen. They give you a nice sized sandwich for your money. The staff is friendly and on point. They do a good lunch business and seem to always have fresh breads, meats and sides."}
{"text":"This was a nice place to eat, they have sandwiches and a salad bar, which salad bars are my favorite, it was not that expensive too."}
{"text":"Woaw!  This place is horrible.  It was my first time at Jason deli, and I probably won't come back.  First off, the cashier Domonique, was extremely rude. We asked her about the salad bar and she seemed really annoyed about having to explain how it works.  When we put in our orders, she asked us what sides we wanted.  I asked her what type of fruits and veggies were offered and she straight up rolled her eyes naming off some fruits that did not even come with my wrap.  It wasn't a big deal, if she didn't know she should've just said so.

We ordered the Mediterranean wrap and the turkey wrap.  Both were from the low cal menu.  Both were not good.  There is significantly less meat, and that's fine because its a low cal wrap, but it was really boring.  The side of vegetables it came with looked really old and was over cooked.  The hummus from the Mediterranean wrap was really grainy in texture, and to top it off there was a piece of rock in there.  I have no clue where that would even come from.  The manager was really nice about it, but didn't seem to know how to handle the situation much.  We didn't ask for a comp, and he didn't offer either, but he did offer to swap it for something else.

While I was eating, I saw a guest loading up his plate from the salad bar.  He was grabbing some hummus and used his finger to scoop it out of the spoon onto his plate.  He then licked his finger, grabbed something else, came back to the hummus and did the same thing.  Wow, that was disgusting, and one of the reasons why I avoid AYCE joints like this.  

Anyway, this whole experience left a foul taste in my mouth.  There are plenty of other places in Vegas that also specialize in sandwiches.  I'll go there before ever coming back to Jason's deli.  hah."}
{"text":"We have been to Jason's Deli in other cities and never really been impressed but this one impressed us! We had a quick light lunch on a Saturday while touring uptown Charlotte. From the minute we walked in, the staff was very friendly. We split a sandwich and they even put it on 2 plates for us. They reminded us of the complimentary muffins, crackers, pickles and ice cream and the panini sandwich was delicious!"}
{"text":"I had the potato which is a limited time item! It was delicious! They also have 3 kinds of tea, Regular, Sweet, and Black Currant.  I very much enjoy the Black Currant and Sweet! The potato with the bbq on top was delicious! The staff was all really friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Had to have my hot pastrami today with some fresh spinach inside. Also had the fresh fruit with the half a sandwich. Very filling and with a a beverage lunch was quite expensive for this day an age for $11.11 for my meal.  It was yummy as always."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant I eat at the most. I can't match the freshness at home and it ends up costing just as much if you consider what goes to waste. You can get in and out in less than thirty minutes every time. Calling in an order ahead of time can eliminate the waiting involved for to go orders. You get 3x as much meat as subway footlongs. The foccacia bread is my favorite."}
{"text":"It's all about the potatoes!  Yea, I've gotten other things - but in the end it is ALL about the baked potatoes.  Their Pollo Mexicano, with chicken cheese, pico de gallo and sour cream on a potato is SO good.  And the potato covered in pulled BBQ meat (think it's pork, but can't remember for sure, could be beef) and cheese is SO good.  Yea, these aren't as good for you as some of their other baked potato options, but MAN are they good!  And the potatoes are huge.  And most of these are less than $6 - and you can generally even make this a 2 meal lunch.  Talk about a bargain.  

Their toasted Po'Boys are pretty good too.  And they have some good \"light\" options as well.  They don't even taste TOO terribly \"light\".  And their kids menu is pretty decent too if I remember.  I haven't brought a child here to be able to get their opinion on it, but I'm guessing based on their other stuff that it has to be pretty good.  

So while I can most likely recommend anything there - to me, it's all about the 'taters."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try their soup. However to my dismay I saw that they only allow criminals to have firearms. I never set foot inside as I value my safety. As a law abiding citizen I follow laws. The sticker on the door will not stop a criminal."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. Visiting from Florida, was so excited when I found out there were Jason's delivery. Ordering online was super easy. However, our food was over an hour late and cold. The only reason I'm giving them a star is because the driver was really nice and did call to let us know he was in traffic, it still took another 40 minutes to make a 15 minute trip. This is so the most disappointing experience with a Jason's. When I called to check on the driver and to ask about the food being cold, the woman was very rude and it felt like she was talking at you instead of with you. Never going to waste my time or money at any Jason's in Vegas."}
{"text":"A good solid place for lunch. The pastrami sand is massive but the light club is always tasty too. Plus free yogurt is always a selling point mmmmm im fat"}
{"text":"I ordered from this location every day for 3 days straight for a conference and was not disappointed. The workers are so sweet and the delivery is amazing - they were never late, in fact, they were early every single time I ordered food. I had a wonderful experience with the workers at this location. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I don't usually review chain restaurants, but chain restaurants usually don't offer affordable, organic, delicious selections--especially without being too pretentious about it. 

Jason's is just that place.  One of my best friends turned me on to it a few years ago and now it is the go-to for a healthy, inexpensive lunch that feels like a taste-bud splurge.

The thing about Jason's is that while it is environmentally responsible as well as body-responsible you don't have to compromise your deli experience in the process of all this responsibility.  If I took my dad here (a usual litmus test for whether or not something is too hippy dippy) he would just think it was a normal, cool deli with good food.  

EXTRA PLUS: 
-Complimentary bran and corn muffins, crackers, garlic bread, and soft serve frozen yogurt

Order at the counter, but get served wherever you pick to sit.  It gets a little crowded at lunch time, but I'm always amazed with how smoothly and quickly the line and fresh food preparation goes.

They also deliver and cater...going to try to make myself remember that for the next work function where we order out."}
{"text":"We use Jason's Deli pretty often for business meetings and office functions. The online ordering system is very easy to use and they always follow-up with a call once the order is submitted. During the follow-up call, they go through the order and verify all is correct. I love that they have options for dietary restrictions too!

The delivery drivers are very pleasant as well! They are always happy help set up the food and make sure the order is right, prior to leaving.

Great food, great service! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about Jason's Deli.  The food is just exquisite for \"faster\" food and the employees are upbeat and friendly.  Gorgeous large dining room is always kept clean and orderly.  The drive thru and delivery options are nice too, despite delivery only being daylight.  
Be warned that the potatoes are HUGE.   Delicious, but huge!  Salad bar is maintained and neat as is the drink station. 
The best part of Jason's is the free ice cream.  Yes, I just said FREE ice cream - in cone or cup form.  What a sweet way to end a yummy meal!

Kudos to the service members up front: it was uplifting to hear positive banter between managers and coworkers while they worked on the orders.  Nice dynamic they seem to have here! 

Will definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Good Food, Great Friendly Service

I just stopped in at the store at Scottsdale Rd and Shea. I had never been to a Jason's deli before and was completely baffled and overwhelmed when I walked in and saw that it wasn't strictly a deli. Karen, who I learned as I was leaving is the GM there, immediately came over to me and explained how everything worked, including pointing out some favorites in case I found the menu overwhelming. She explained the workings of the salad bar, the specials, etc. at the moment that I was tempted to get back in my car and go someplace that I understood. She was VERY friendly and accommodating.

So, I stayed and had a wonderful experience. My muffaletta sandwich was wonderful, I enjoyed the salad bar, and the iced tea was delicious (which is not true of many places). Of course, Karen kept checking back with me, bringing me containers and a bag for the remainder of my huge sandwich, my salad, and my iced tea, and reminding me that the ice cream and the dry end of the salad bar were complimentary. 

Thanks to Karen, as much as to the food, I know that I will be returning. She personally brought such warmth and welcome to my visit. There is nothing like great customer service."}
{"text":"Food is generally good. Service here was an odd occasion on two instances I went here. The door greeter called the young lady bringing our food to us, 'retarded.' Because she forgot to take the number off our table.
Second time, they brought only half the order and I had to help the waitress figure out which food she had of ours, as she didn't know what sandwiches she was carrying."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Jason's Deli before.  But, now that I have, I must say that I agree with the overall 4-star rating this establishment currently enjoys.  Chicken Noodle Soup with tender morsels of chicken, carrots, and thick noodles was hot and with a distinctly flavored chicken broth that was more robust than most.  My Ham & Hard Salami Quarter-Muffaletta was packed with meat that melded well with the minced olives and tasted great after being squeezed together by the top and bottom of the delicious yielding, toasted, and sesame-covered New Orleans style bun.

And, Diane's Beefeater was packed in a soft French Roll with even more lean meat and a huge expanse of well-melted Provolone Cheese.  A generous amount of hot au jus stood by in a bowl for serious dunking.  It was redolent of beef, with a rich flavor of meat juices that tasted great!  Pickle spears were good, but chips just the type that had been poured out of a commercially sold bag.

The place is nothing fancy, but it is serviceable and comfortable, with plenty of table and booth seating available to accommodate a large lunchtime crowd.  Table tops were continually in the process of being cleared and cleaned by a large and efficient staff as soon as a diner got up and began to leave.  

On this occasion I found a Quarter-Muffaletta to be adequate.  But next time I am going to attack a Half-Muffaletta, and see if I can handle it in one sitting.  A Whole-Muffaletta is a beast that would be more suitable for an episode of \"Man vs. Food!\""}
{"text":"Always delicious. My husband got a southwest something sandwich and I had a panini with a trip to the salad bar.  Everything was great and the customer service was awesome."}
{"text":"40 minutes for a to go order. Great place to watch orders ahead of you leave with their food."}
{"text":"Great deli with TONS of seating.  They have a salad bar option, but no matter what you get cornbread and garlic toast and ice cream for free.  It's a quick order, and they bring the food out to you.  The muffalettas are HUUUUGE.  The sandwiches are awesome and so are the actual salads (never tried the salad bar option yet).  I've gotten the nutty salad, and the salmon caesar.  All top notch.  This is definitely a quick get in and out and good food to boot whether it's lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Fresh tasting, hot/cold depending on how it was ordered, and good accuracy with orders (even large orders).  Good location outside the mall so you don't have to deal with the mall people as much.  A little pricey but worth it for a quality sandwich."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Jason Deli's in a couple years and I feel like I have been missing out like crazy! This is definitely one of my new favorite places to get a sandwich! There menu is fantastic and the prices are impossible to beat! I loved that I was able to get some complimentary ice cream after lunch, I felt like a little kid again and I had no shame in that! I loaded that sucka with all the toppings I could find and walked back to my table with my chest up and a little swagger in my step because I had a free fully
loaded ice cream sundae in my hands! My girlfriend thought I was ridiculous, but I thought it was awesome so that's all that matters! 10/10"}
{"text":"Great variety on the menu, even lots of vegetarian options!!! The kids menu was great as well. The salad bar looked amazing. I had a spinach veggie wrap and it was nice. I didn't love that there were a lot of employees, including the manager, sitting around while most of the tables had crumbs or trash. My strawberries were a bit slimy but they did give me chips and salsa as well. Unfortunately the chips were a bit stale. My wrap was great though and my kids were happy with their soup, baked potato, and pizza. We loved the free ice cream at the end. All in all a good experience and we will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Had I not known in advance that this is a chain, I would never have been able to tell based on my experience. As you walk into Jason's Deli, you're immediately guided to the counter by a walkway. The man behind the counter was new but super friendly and able to answer most of my questions. Service at this location was top notch.

As for the food. Take note, I didn't notice the Reuben (or I would have ordered it) so I went with a Muffaletta which is a grilled sandwich coated to the edges with their olive spread. I had the quarter roasted turkey. The olive spread was divine but the sandwich itself wasn't to my liking. The cheese hadn't melted and the meats were still cold. If I order a grilled sandwich, I want it hot. I was very disappointed with the temperature. Even more so when I actually saw the Rueben that someone else had ordered. 

The service here made this whole experience standout. Especially Teddy who deserves Five-Stars. He was running circles around his coworkers, bussing tables, asking people if they were enjoying everything. He was a kind man and deserves to be celebrated. He really made me enjoy the whole experience just a little bit more."}
{"text":"My last place of residency was Omaha Ne, and I was introduced to Jason's Deli there and fell in love with the simple food/ingredients and immaculate salad bar with nice patrons sitting and conversing casually as they enjoyed their food and free soft serve ice cream. I was expecting the same type of dining experience her in Vegas but was disappointed.

Once ordered they give you a number that you set in a clamp on the table so the server knows where to bring your meal once served; I was sitting within earshot of the counter and I heard them say runner my number and after 5 mins I heard them yell runner my number again; I walked over and asked if I could take my sandwich back to my table on my own; no apology, no thank you, just yeah and they turned their back to me. 

The salad bar is good size and the food was fresh but was missing something unique to make it stand out above their competitors; I did see a sign that proclaimed \"pickle lovers rejoice\" and was expecting to find a few different choices of pickles to choose from; there was only one and they pickles were older/wilted pickles that had lost their crunch. Was very disappointed as I wanted to rejoice in pickle bliss. 

The crowd was loud but that may have a lot to do with the acoustics inside the place but was rather distracting not something I was used to from the store in Omaha; the tables are laid out so you are force to squeeze between aisles but that I'm sure is due to how popular they are and their attempt to give everyone a place to sit. 

They do have good food and I highly recommend the Chicken Pot Pie they serve it in a small size if you want to do soup and sandwich or you can order a full cup and it will surely fill you up and taste delicious. My only major recommendation is to try to go during non-peak hours so you don't get over whelemed by the crowd and your food doesn't get stuck sitting on a counter getting cold while the servers try to maneuver around the aisles and aisles of people hovering."}
{"text":"Personally nothing to write home about here.... Every time I go in, it does satisfy my need for a good sandwich that is different then your usual sandwich shops. Below is what I like:

-Large selection of soups

-Decent sandwiches

-Ice Cream

Personally, I won't go out of my way for Jason's Deli but then again, I also won't avoid it if I am passing by or meeting friends here."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Great service! Had a minor mishap and was handled professionally and everyone left happy and full of good food!!"}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices. Not the most comfortable seating and the tables are crammed together pretty tight, but again the food is worth the trip."}
{"text":"This is my favorite JD location. It's my to-go place for everyday lunch and by FAR the best  option in downtown (yes, I said it. Screw you Le Thai, Eat, and other hip places ).  You can go healthy with soup and salad or  nuts with ice cream and muffins. 

What really makes the difference is the staff. Great customer service! Everyone is super friendly. Place is clean and food quality is consistent. 

Because I go during the week, I usually get soup and salad. One of the best options for healthy eating. After a while I find it difficult not to get my greens for lunch. Honestly it is the best lunch under $10 ($9.60).  

I think I have been here more than 70 times during the last couple of years. 

Lots of bureaucrats, cops, and attorneys!!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday and was blown away by this place!! Delicious sandwich!! I ordered the Sgt. Pepper which has french dip. Yum! Ill be back this sunday, cant wait!"}
{"text":"The Reuben is my favorite sandwich and they offer it with either corned beef or pastrami. I chose pastrami, which was pretty good, and it comes with a bag of chips. I've found Jason's to have friendly employees and a nice variety of sandwiches and the like. Sandwiches come with a pickle that is oh so nicely wrapped which is a nice touch. 

This location has quite a large dining area and don't forget about free ice cream! I have yet to try it as it's not been mentioned to me yet by any employee. The salad bar is also a nice option and I'd like to try that sometime. Soup options change seasonally, so I've been told."}
{"text":"I'm attending a class close by for the week and decided to come over here for lunch! The location is great plenty of parking and the seating area is a great size your not sitting up on someone else while eating! The restaurant is very clean and well lit! The food looks amazing very fresh and great portions! I had the chicken Alfredo and the entree was probably one of the best I've ever eaten in a restaurant! The sweet tea was on point! I will definitely be back a few more times this week to try the different menu items!"}
{"text":"They have a salmon salad , it looks good on the picture, but it came out cold and fishy smell, and I asked for some chicken , it wasn't good at all, I won't be back here again, just saying !!!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what Jason's Deli was all about until a year ago.  Now it's always the place to go when looking for a great salad or some hot food.  My office gets a lot of their box lunches which make our seminars and meetings pretty fun and tasty.

It's a little hard getting in and our of the parking lot since Harris has those large islands - gotta make a U-turn to get back to the direction you want to go, but it's a small sacrifice compared to the salad and food offered here.

Free ice cream too!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch. Place was busy but staff was friendly and helpful. Ordered the Cuban press. Food was good and so was the service"}
{"text":"The food here at Jason's deli is mediocre at best and doesn't really need a place on your Vegas to-do list. This is considering that the atmosphere feels dead and service was treacherous. Trying to figure out what I wanted on the menu, the cashier lady kept harassing me, \"So have you decided? ... I got a job to do ... taking all day aren't you?\" This lady was extremely rude and was lucky I didn't just walk out. I got the \"Rachel\" and it was ok. One star."}
{"text":"My last visit to Jason's Deli was disappointing. I always opt for the salad bar and add chicken. First, this place is totally overpriced for what it is. The salad bar is $8.29 and to add a protein is $3.99. That means if you get a salad bar with chicken it's $13.29 after taxes. You can get a salad at any other restaurant for less than this. 

I went around 7PM and some of the items on the salad bar were either empty or low. They were not doing a good job of keeping it stocked. Some of the romaine lettuce was brown. GROSS. I'm assuming that they chop it up in store. I don't understand why they wouldn't remove those pieces. 

The salad bar is pretty standard. They have a couple options for lettuce - romaine, greener, and then spinach. They also have tons of vegetable options. Tons of dressing options. There is also a selection of pre-made pasta salad, potato salad, etc. One of my favorite items on the salad bar is the roasted red pepper hummus. It's delicious and goes great with the little garlic bread that they have. 

My favorite part of visiting Jason's Deli is the free ice cream. It is so creamy and delicious. They should consider changing their name to Jason's ice cream - that's how good it is. However, on this trip, the cone box was empty and there were no clean dishes available by the side of the ice cream machine. I had to go to the counter and ask for a dish. 

The staff wasn't doing a great job at keeping tables cleared when we were there. So if they're not keeping things stocked on the salad bar and at the beverage bar/ice cream, AND they're not keeping tables cleared... WHAT ARE THEY ALL DOING? I was really disappointed with this last trip. It just seems overpriced and that the quality isn't all that great."}
{"text":"I've been a Jason's Deli fan for years, having lived in their home state of Texas and enjoyed many of their different sandwiches... This location was close to my hotel on a recent trip to Vegas.

It has been almost impossible to find a Louisiana-style muffaletta in Norcal, so I was only too happy to stuff my face with one here last week. It was delicious, as always! The staff here are friendly and fast, it's clean, and it looks like it can get busy at lunchtime. The only reason I deducted a star is because if you aren't on foot or working in the building, the parking garage is expensive.

I recommend this place... The food is consistently good and with the variety they offer, you're sure to find something you will love, including their super-fresh salad bar. 

And I finally got my Muffy!"}
{"text":"Excellent Customer Service.

I actually had placed an online order but wanted to order a old favorite of the broccoli and cheese potato so I had to call that in. They assisted me fast and quickly.

Upon arrival, I was greeted by a worker, just a simple hello. But it was nice. I picked up my food and experienced wonderful service by everyone that helped me. I was able to get my to go order quickly and was in and out. 

The food was hot and fresh and well prepared. You just can't go wrong with the food. When it comes to chains, where you know the food will taste identical no matter the location you go, it is customer service that wins me over hands down and they have that perfected at this location."}
{"text":"Having heard buzz about a Jason's Deli coming to Madison, we were excited to try it!  After a bustling day of holiday shopping this past weekend we swung through their drive-thru which was handy for a dreary Wisconsin winter day!  We had the Chicken Pasta Primo (which came with garlic bread) and an order of the tomato bisque soup.  Admittedly our wait at the window was a little long, but they gave us a delicious cookie to tide us over!   But the food was great...a really nice option for drive through that isn't fries or burgers!  The chicken pasta was prepared perfectly with great chicken and tomato sauce and parmesan.  Also, the tomato soup was chunky and tasted like it was \"real\" tomatoes crushed in there!  Overall I would say it's quality food at fair prices, with no high fructose corn syrup in anything (yay) with very friendly staff and service!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Came here because I wanted to check out a salad bar.  I love salad!  I would say it is just an average salad bar place.  Got some broccoli cheddar soup that tasted good but nothing spectacular.  I don't know if I would frequent this joint but it's an okay spot for a quick average lunch!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for the first time for a quick sandwhich. The corn beef was as good as it gets and compared to NY deli's, the quantity was great!  I especially like the \"lighter portion\" offerings, just in case you aren't really THAT hungry.  Great looking salad bar, which I must try the next time I am there. My hat off to the bus boys. They were very quick and looked to keep our table clean!"}
{"text":"Always a good sandwich and the muffaletta is best best outside the big easy.  The food is fresh and often local organic.  The service is friendly and the complimentary ice cream great.  Sadly the last couple times I have been there the tea was \"off\" so the iced tea icky.  Otherwise a good sandwich joint."}
{"text":"Outside of New Orleans it is quite hard to find a good muffaletta.  That is why Jason's is so terrific.  They have the sandwich which is nearly as good as the original in the Big Easy.  Almost. . The staff is very patient as you try to make a decision.  It is always hard to decide between all the goodies there.  I usually end up with the muffaletta.  They have some nice baked chips and the food is fresh and made for you after you order.  The gumbo and other soups are good as are the various sandwiches.  Great salad bar and the yogurt/ice cream machine is a nice treat as well. The food comes out hot and fast as well.  The store is always clean and the catering part of the business is obviously doing well.  I am happy that they are here and we have a taste of NO in PHX."}
{"text":"This was one my wife and my favorite places to grab a sandwich and a salad. Our last two visits have been awful. The restaurant appeared dirty, 8 or more un bused tables and the ones that had been bused were still dirty. The salad wasn't up to par and the sandwich was only so so.
We are not going back for a third try."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli consistently has fresh, tasty, perfectly seasoned salads and sandwiches. My favorite is the. . . 
 
Nutty Mixed-Up Salad 7.79
organic field greens, grapes, chicken breast,
feta cheese, walnuts, dried cranberries,
pumpkin seeds, raisins and organic apples.
served with leo's balsamic vinaigrette.

Can't go wrong with any of those ingredients!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing little whole in the wall deli. Great food, complimentary little muffins, and ice cream cones. Plus great prices and friendly staff."}
{"text":"There are several reasons why you should stay away from this business but the top two are food pricing and customer service. The latter is why Jason's Deli will fail and file for bankruptcy within the next 3 to 5 years. #1 They did not hire a great staff. #2 Even one of the owners of this location Christopher Salen did not listen to the customer. #3 Did not take immediate action to unsatisfied customer. No matter what the situation, never tell your customers that they are wrong. Even if your customer was the one at fault, you do not want
to point fingers or make him/her feel embarrassed. The main priority is to sort out the problem and continue to ensure that your customers have an enjoyable experience in your operation. #4 Don't tell customers that \"It's your policy\" There is nothing more infuriating
for a customer than to hear than the words \"It's our policy.\" This implies that your restaurant is inflexible and unwilling to work out a solution that will ensure that your customer has an enjoyable experience. If you want a better dining experience with true competitive pricing on menu items do not go here. On a health note: I strongly believe that meat is stored improper where it fails to meet Nevada Health Code requirements so BEWARE!"}
{"text":"I love eating at Jason's Deli!! Great salad bar!! Love the Beef Eater sandwich!! You get your food in a timely manner. Great place to eat!!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are made to order, fresh and taste great! Hubby had the roast beef sandwich, looked great and tasted just as great. I had the side salad which from the selection at the salad bar,  you won't be disappointed.  Plus with any entree you buy,  there is a complementary area with mini cornbread, mini chocolate muffins, assorted crackers and soft serve ice cream that tastes amazing. 
We made it with five minutes till closing,  but the employees were still so welcoming, minus one who was rude. They made sure we got everything we needed and waited to make sure we didn't want seconds on the salad bar before breaking it down."}
{"text":"I am usually a big fan of Jason's Deli so when I found out I can cater my downtown team with my favorite chicken salad sandwich, I jumped on it. I ordered the mini croissant platter and it was a big waste of $64. The only thing that was fresh was the pre packaged pickles. I put in the order at 7:15am and told them pick up was at 9:15am and at 9:30 they were still working on the order. I asked the lady if time would be an issue, she told me no but they were still throwing together the order when I got there and it tasted like it was thrown together too. I think they would've tasted better if the bread was fresh. After everyone had the same consensus on how bland everything was, we won't be ordering with them again."}
{"text":"First time I've had Jason's in a while.  When I used to travel to San Antonio (which was a lot) our meeting always catered lunch from Jason's.  For the most part it was serviceable.

Today was a qualified serviceable.  I ordered the Ruben and Cuban sandwiches.  The Ruben was ok.  The Cuban not so much.  

The Cuban is designed to be a warm sandwich (or at least the cheese should be melted).  Weeeeeellllllll not so much.  The Cuban (which is allegedly cooked on a panini press)  pretty much tasted like it just came out of the fridge.

I'm only giving them a 3 based on the Ruben.  Otherwise the place is a 2."}
{"text":"Love the chicken pot pie and I like the fact that you can build your own sandwich"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good most of the time. The only time I avoid going here is at the end of the day because I feel like the soups they make are not fresh and the salad bar is not fresh. Overall I don't have any major complaints, I still enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I stopped by to hang out while waiting for our print job to be done at office max.  I bought a cookie, drink, and took advantage of the free soft serve ice cream. The manager Mike asked if we were good and that we should get some free ice cream (i finished my cone already so he didnt see) very nice and great customer service. I've been to Jason's Deli before in boca park and i know the food is always fantastic but today my friend and i just needed to waste 30 minutes. I will definitely be back to get some real food. Thank you"}
{"text":"I've had Jason's Deli in the past during work events that were catered, but I'd never actually been inside one of their stores. 

I have to say, I wasn't entirely impressed, but it's a decent option for lunch. One of my major turn offs with this location was that the service was spotty at best. The girl who took our order was nice but there seemed to be quite a disconnect between the ordering, pick up and rest of the service. We stood around for a little too long with our receipts to pick up our salad plates, despite having several employees walk past us knowing we were waiting. I didn't entirely understand having to take our receipts just a few feet down the line when it seemed easy enough for the cashier to hand us empty salad plates since she had already handed us empty drink cups. 

Once we were finally seated and had our food, I was happy enough with the food. The soup was perfect to soothe my sore throat and the side of fruit was surprisingly fresh and delicious. The sandwich was decent too although I'd likely ask them not to toast my croissant next time. Just too crunchy and crumbly for my taste.

When my fella wanted a clean salad plate and tried to hand over his dirty one to an employee emptying the trash, he instead directed my guy to the front counter again. I think they could definitely work on their customer service and communication skills, but otherwise it's a good option for lunch."}
{"text":"First time here. I really enjoyed my meal. It was so large I could only eat half of my sandwich. They had complimentary muffins and garlic bread on the salad bar for everyone even without purchasing the salad bar. Not sure on the pricing I did not buy. I will go back again."}
{"text":"Desperate for a quick bite this was our choice, which we sadly regret now.

First the gentleman that took our order was great. Awesome personality, asked questions to make sure our food came out right. Husband ordered a a hot corned beef on a croissant, I ordered a light portion beefeaters on New Orleans French.

After ordering and filling our drinks we took a seat and waited. Looking around the place has a dark, dinghy feel. At least to me.

When our food arrived it looked really good but both sandwiches were ice cold. Who wants a French dip ice cold with congealed cheese? Husband said his corned beef would not have had any flavor if it wasn't for the mustard slathered all over the croissant. I thought my sandwich didn't have any mayonnaise until I had eaten half way thru and a blob squirted out the side. Both of us only ate half of our sandwiches.

For $26 I expected so much more and probably won't return. McAlister's at Arrowhead has Jason's beat by a mile."}
{"text":"We go here a couple of times a month to get a light meal. The food is good. Not great but good. There is plenty of seating and it is a nice place to meet family, get a light meal and sit and talk. Another reason I like to go here is, most restaurants you get way to much to eat at a sitting, but what do you do? You eat it all or at least I do as I don't like to waste food and there is to little to take home. Here I can get a half sandwich and a cup of soup. AAAAnd You get to have a cone of frozen dairy. I usually do not get this. Have to watch my girlish figure. I Wish. For a place to go, sit down, relax, talk with friends. This place is a good place."}
{"text":"My wife and children often to to Jason's to eat. We like it because after we finish we feel welcome to just sit there for a hour and talk. This night it was just my wife and I along with a take out for my son and his wife. 
This was our first time or at least for me to visit this location. We usually go to the Arrowhead location. 
When we got there the place was very cold. a couple of tables of people had their hoodies up because of the cold. I believe it was almost colder inside than out side. The air conditioner was on because you could feel the cold air coming from the vents on your head. It was not that they did not know it was cold as everyone that came in reminded them how cold it was inside. We would of left if it had not been for the order for my son and his wife. We figured we could leave our coats on and eat quickly and leave. Which is what we did. 
My wife got the chicken pot pie soup. She usually gets this at the other Jason's. It came to the table to cold to eat. It was sent back to be heated. My sandwich was good. 

I will be back to Jason's just not this one."}
{"text":"Jason's Deli is the kind of place I want to love.  It's just the anti-Subway.  
I have been to several locations around the country and I have always been really excited... until, that is, I eat the food.

The food, while fresh, is very bland.  It was no exception this visit.

Additionally, on my recent visit, I only had about 2-3 oz of turkey on my Papa Joe sandwich (the equivalent of maybe one and a half store bought slices shredded).  That was very surprising and sad.  The bread was ginormous, so maybe they thought I couldn't use the protein.  

My daughter's turkey on white with cheese had about four times the amount of turkey as did my sandwich.  She didn't care for the American Cheese (that's not real cheese Mommy), but she gobbled down the turkey and her side of apples.  She left the white bread and cheese on the plate.

Mom got a combo with 1/2 a Papa Joe (still lacking on turkey) and a cup of their pot pie soup (which was oddly sweet).  She thought it was Meh.

So let's call this place a 3.5* joint because their salad bar and potatoes are pretty good.  We just didn't order them this time around.  

Minus a 1/2 star because not one table was properly cleaned.  It did not appear any chemicals were used to clean the tables, as they all had greasy hand prints and smudges on them.  Additionally, I watched as the busser cleared off a table.  He just used an-already moist rag and just quickly ran it over one corner of the table before walking away.  

I don't plan to come here again."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and they have delightful salad bar also. Great offerings for kids as well and I loved variety of soups and sandwiches on the menu."}
{"text":"Typical Jason's with a wide variety of sandwiches, soups and a big ole salad bar.  This location in the Epicenter does a very brisk lunch business and, based on the number of times I see their lunch spreads outside meeting rooms at work, a brisk catering business as well.

I really enjoy the chicken pot pie soup and like you can create your own sandwich should one of the menu versions don't fit your tastes quite right."}
{"text":"Always busy for lunch and has a decent salad bar selection-wise but the dressings are mass-produced meh at best.  Same really goes for the sandwiches and soups.  Just average and the quality of meats is always hit or miss.  Sometimes you get nice, lean roast beef.  Next time its full of fat and gristle.  Anytime I've ever ventured toward something like pastrami, it's been just a bunch of fat on a bun for the most part.  Ick.  Really, as I think about it, Jason's is pretty much 1 star for food but, they do a nice job of handling the crush of people and getting the average food out pretty quickly so, 1 seemed a bit too severe for a holistic rating."}
{"text":"Due to BPA concerns, I won't be getting hot sandwiches at Jason's anymore. All hot protein on sandwiches are heated in plastic bags. The club sandwiches are still awesome."}
{"text":"Just stop by for a late lunch, tried the vegetarian onion soup. Great flavor! I will definitely order it again, not a big fan of the salad bar, but I really like the baked potatoes and soups."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. Jason's deli is actually pretty decent.

I ordered the managers special 1/2 famous sandwich and salad bar. Came out to $10 and change. 

Got the great ruben and made my own salad.  

Ruben the great half Sammich was decent. Pastrami wasn't overly salty and saur kraut  wasn't too sour. It was just your run of the mill ruben sandwhich.

Salad bar definitely stole the show. Lots of premium toppings including artichoke hearts, Kalamata olives, marinated mufalata veggies and many more. There are  deserts like pudding and granola also. They also have mini cornbread muffins and brownie bites.  Salad bar is endless you exhange your plate for a clean one and you are free to go another round. 

I think I will just get salad bar next time....or most likely try another sammich.

Also, They are very proud of their FREE ice cream...LOL 3 different workers made sure to mention it to me and there are multiple signs advertising it. So, OF COURSE, I was obligated to get a cone. Not too bad, typical buffet cheapy soft serve but for free it was pretty good. 

I will definitely be coming back in the future


Enjoy...I did."}
{"text":"I love Jason's deli I just wish they had more around town it's hard to find a good salad bar."}
{"text":"I love this place! I wish there where more salad bars in Las Vegas. Can I request you open more locations preferably in 89117 near chinatown near buffalo and spring mountain? :) I often look for healthy options when I'm around town, and there are not as many healthy options as I'd like. This places salad bar is the best I have ever had anywhere and I have traveled most of the USA. Tho I wish there plate was a little deeper b.c. I need more space to mix the salad. I haven't tried anything else in this place yet, but I'm sure I will be a return customer. I'm a salad eater. I even eat salads @ home most of the time. I'm a health nut I guess, I like my veggies. They have cheeses, and nuts, best vegetarian salad @ any salad bar I have ever eaten @, and they had cut little melon ball shaped beets. I like beets in my salads. Better then souplantation."}
{"text":"We ordered our \"getting ready\" food for our wedding day from Jason's Deli because of all the rave reviews from The Knot Las Vegas message board. Well, those reviews were all correct. Jason's Deli is really awesome.

It was an easy process to place the platters order for 12 people. I called a couple days before and they took my order over the phone. They also took my credit card payment. On the day off, we had the best delivery driver ever. There was a shooting on the Las Vegas strip and they closed the whole entire strip. No cars allowed at all. Traffics were bad every direction on Las Vegas freeways. Our delivery driver called me every 15 minutes or so to update me where his location was so I wasn't panicked.

He got  there not too long after with our party platters. He was so nice, he even brought our food to our suite. The breakfast sandwiches were still warm. Fruits were fresh, and even the coffee jug was still warm. Everything were tasty and we were happy we had food while we were getting ready for our big day. It made me one less cranky bridezilla ;).

Thank you, Jason's Deli for the awesome service. We will recommend you to every single bride who's getting married in Las Vegas. Viva Jason's Deli!"}
