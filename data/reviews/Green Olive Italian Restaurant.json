{"text":"This is my favourite Italian spot in the city!!!! The pasta is fresh made! And the variety is plenty! I believe it is family owned so it is kinda small, but it adds to the effect, it's nice and low key and gives a cozy light type of atmosphere , I usually eat here once a week! It has been one of my fav spots for a while now! And it's located right in the hood baby! Ha ha NE Calgary Green Olive..   There are a variety of different pastas , but also AA quality Alberta beer burgers and mouth watering steaks ! I would recommend  you take a date or bring the family! It's a fun time . Enjoy"}
{"text":"Green Olive is a small family owned restaurant located in a strip mall. The menu is quite extensive and features mostly pasta dishes - pretty standard \"Italian fare\". I ordered a seafood dish from their \"specialty\" section, and it included mussels, shrimp, scallops, scampi, red peppers and mushrooms on fettuccine - all swimming in a thin, white wine sauce.   The pasta looked overcooked and it was all served on a shallow plate which threatened to spill over when the ungraceful waitress brought it out to me. I also noticed at this moment that the only napkin I had was a thin paper one.   Pasta: cooked right, but difficult to eat because of the shallow dish. Mussels: tasted okay. Not rubbery which is good. Shrimp: cooked as expected... Nice and fleshy. Scampi: I made a mess eating these since a small fork was not provided. Overcooked and flaky.  Our waitress was not very polite... she was very gruff. When we ordered a bottle of wine, she did confused Chardonnay with Zinfandel, and she said, \"Three glasses okay with you guys?\" instead of something like, \"How many glasses would you like?\" It was busy in the restaurant, but it doesn't matter - she should have been pleasanter than she was. Her attitude suites a burger joint diner, but not an Italian restaurant.  My partner ordered breaded veal cutlet with spaghetti in tomato sauce, and he mentioned that the veal was nice and tender but the pasta was overcooked. It was more like a big mushy pile than spaghetti.  Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Standard Italian fare. Here's the kicker, within walking distance of anyone in Monterey Park, Pineridge area near 68th St and 16th Ave NE. The prices are very reasonable and they have a Tuesday special that my family takes advantage of fairly frequently.  Had the Gnocci, it was very tasty, presented in a nice Ros√©e sauce with peas. I'm a meat eater, it's a no meat plate, didn't miss it.  Had a fettuccine alfredo on Valentine's day, presented with Proscutto, grilled chicken and peas, very tasty decent portions.  I found the Calamari tops as well, I seem to be on this calamari kick, been trying it every where, it was good here. Tasted like the type you would find as a side dish in a Chinese restaurant, but I liked the taste.  Never too busy (even on Valentine's day, without a reservation, we were sitting in 15 minutes), clean, friendly, reasonably priced and close to home, can't ask for anything more.  Used to be the old Robin's Donuts near Co-op on 68th, you can barely tell, unless you grew up around here."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is not my favourite place but it out does this place....."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both times weren't amazing. The food was good, but just good. I found it lacked pizazz, but the service was impeccable."}
{"text":"When you've got someone with a big appetite and need a reasonable price with which to feed them, Green Olive is a pretty good bet. The restaurant itself is pretty casual, complete with checkered picnic-esque table cloths. On the walls hang some Italian-style prints on canvas that you could pick up at your local home decor store, but they match the rest of the restaurant, so it's all good.  I ordered myself some linguini puntanesca-prosiutto, mushrooms and a cream sauce. I believe the dish was $10.95. It's by no means the drool-worthy plate of spaghetti I once had in Italy, but decent food nonetheless. It's the kind of place I'd probably take my parents. They grew up in small town Saskatchewan. They'd be comfortable here.  Location is pretty easy to find, just hop on Hwy 1 and exit at 68th St Northbound."}
{"text":"This place used to be great! My husband and I would eat here often because the food was cheap and the service was great! We recently moved back to Calgary from living in another province for a few years and decided to eat at our favorite restaurant, well let me tell you, this place has gone down hill! The service SUCKS! They don't come around and refill your drinks, you pretty much have to go to the bar for anyone to pay any attention to you. It took forever to get our food, which they ended up having all wrong and instead of offering to fix it they offered my husband another basket of stale bread. I'm really sad to see this place go down the shitter, I've been telling all my friends to eat here at your own risk, I'm pretty sure I lost brain cells talking to the manager! Don't eat here!!!"}
