{"text":"3-stars for the food
1-more star for the love at the register

Ordered the #1 and #3 (gyro fries and drink, steak gyro fries and drink)
A couple pieces of the steak were chewy, jaw-sore chewy. But it was loaded with steak so no complaints for only 2 off pieces.

Spent a couple pennies under $20 for the 2 combos and a pea cup of hummus and a pita for the toddler."}
{"text":"I like the gyro salad there.  Gyro meat on top of a yummy salad, with a pita and tzatziki on the side.  Eat it with a fork, of course.  I'm 48 and can get a gyro sandwich anywhere.  This is just something tasty and seems to deliver more edibles and less bread than a gyro sandwich."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite yesterday. Split the Chicken Schwarma wrap and the Hummus appetizer with my wife. It was delicious and filling, and we got out for under $15- I recommend this place over a couple of it's Tempe Marketplace neighbors if you're looking to eat quickly, but still get good food for not a lot of $$$."}
{"text":"\"The Greek Pita\" at Tempe marketplace - #10 chicken kebab (pita) with garlic sauce is the bomb schizzle"}
{"text":"I've only tried the gyro salad and it is excellent. Perfect for my diet and reasonable price."}
{"text":"Very friendly employees- I am guessing it is a family that runs it. I got the chicken pita a few times and that was good, but last time I got a chicken plate that came with a pita, rice, and salad and that was DELICIOUS! If you like Greek food, you will like this place!"}
{"text":"great food, love the shawerma sandwich, the people working there are very nice and friendly, went there with  my kids and they love it
defiantly coming back"}
{"text":"This place has excellent Greek food at a reasonable price. They have changed since things in the past year that I have bit agreed with, but overall it is a great place to eat. They also have a few things that are not on the menu that you can still get. The number 15 combo, it is a kefta kabob pita with frys and a drink. It is excellent!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here! Their Philly steak gyro and Greek fry's are my favorite. Top notch customer service to! When I'm unsure of what I want to eat, I eat here. never fails to satisfy me."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place about once a week, but the quality of the food and customer service have deteriorated to the point that I will not be returning. The last time I tried to eat there was on 7/9/17. For the third straight time they screwed up my order, which is no big deal if they are willing to fix it. However, the girl acting as the cashier wanted to argue with me about what I ordered. The employees are rude and fail to listen or pay attention to detail. Definitely not recommended if you want friendly service or accurate orders."}
{"text":"So, I had the Gyro. It was ok not great but not horrible either the meat was soft the Pita was soft witch are good things, Now as far as The Tzatziki Sauce it was one of the worst I've had. No flavor it tasted and looked watered down. Looked like a watered down Ranch Dressing. I doubt if I'll ever go back again..Unless I'm really craving a Gyro and happen to be near there most likely I wont go back."}
{"text":"The place serves amazing gyro on a bun or on a dish. Their chicken? Cooked just perfect. Their portions? After you're done eating, you'll need to take the rest to go. This place has amazing food at a great price for what's its worth. This is our regular go to place."}
{"text":"Just after a movie at the theater,  we found this amazing place ! I took the chicken Shawarma and it was awesome!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So good. I love greek food and this place has plenty of it. Great service too. The humus plater is great"}
{"text":"Although food was not bad, the price was over and above what I'd expect to pay at a similar Greek restaurant for similar food. In short, not worth the price."}
{"text":"I wanted a quick dinner to bring back home and stopped here. I got their gyro combo and substituted a side salad for fries. To start - gyro was awesome. Filled with a good mix of beef and lamb. The sauce was great on it too. Side salad - perfect sized cut up green peppers and cucumbers.  Dressing came on side and was just right. Grabbed baklava for dessert - get it. They use slightly cut up candied pistachios for part of the filling. 

I'll go back for sure. One of my favorite Greek places in town."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant couple of times , and the past two times they have burnt the gyros meat .. which I find disrespectful. Can't they see the meat is burnt before they serve it .. other than that the food is good , the atmosphere is relaxing and chill to grab quick dinner or so if your shopping at tempe marketplace .."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and the food is super yummy ! We visited this place many times and we always feel very satisfied .. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Although the gyro meat here is actually pretty good, I'm giving it a one star because of the piece of hair I found in my food. Pretty disgusted after that, so I'm never going back. Check your food everyone!!"}
{"text":"This place is alright. As the previous user described their fries are not that good at all. I've been to other Greek places and paid around the same and the food was way better quality. The only reason you would want to go to this place is due to staff they were nice and ended up bringing our food to our table when or order was done. 

I would recommend the place next door chipotle before going here."}
{"text":"Honestly nothing special. People still eat there don't ask me. Food Is Bland Theye Skimp On Hummus, man dunk the stuff on my plate it's good for me I want more of it. This place give soo little hummus, nothing really memorable. ..."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place more than a few times, and have yet to be disappointed. Main dish (I get the number 10), fries and a drink (free refills) for two and we get out under $25 bucks every time. 

And honestly, to those who say 9 or 10 bucks a head is too much to spend to eat out, I simply scratch my head, agree to disagree and point them to McDonald's. You'll get a lot less many places for a lot more.

Every item on the menu is in picture form and described on the big wall over the open-to-view cooking area, so you see what you get, figuratively and literally.  Proximity to the movie theater at Tempe Marketplace and speed of service are what brought us in, great food and a nice counter girl keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"Went to Greek Pita a couple nights ago. Very clean place and the staff was friendly. I ordered the Gyro combo and my wife got the Greek salad. I thought the Gyro and fries had good flavor and were a good portion size. My only complaint was that my pita was a little stale. My wife thought this place had one of the best greek salads that she has had in a long time. She said 5 star for the Greek Pita."}
{"text":"I love this place! I don't get the folks that are saying it's expensive. I've been twice now and each time had one of their plates - falafel and chicken shwarma. The plates come with the main dish (generous portion), a pita, a generous helping of rice and a Greek side salad, plus Tahini or garlic sauce. All of that for about $10, and it's delicious. I think the prices are fair for the quality and amount of food you get. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Greek salad and added shawarma chicken on it.  The serving was a large plate and definitely enough to fill the belly. The chicken was perfectly marinated / seasoned.  The cashier was very friendly. The restaurant was also clean and neat. They have seating both inside and outside which is nice.  I'll definitely be back here."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend if you are in Tempe Marketplace and can't decide what to eat! Everything that I have had is delicious my favorite is the falafel plate with fries. The falafel here is unique and made with fried garbanzo instead of chickpeas. They fry it well done and it taste is unbelievable. One of my favorite falafels I've ever had. 5 stars."}
{"text":"It is absolutely delicious with very generous portions. Each meal comes with your personal hummos. I love their gyro, and did I mention their French fries  ( I love fries lol) crispy outside, and soft inside , delish. House sauce awesome. Staff very friendly. It is a fast food, but inside Tempe Marketplace it's a very cool location. Highly recommend !!!"}
{"text":"I love getting the chicken shawarma sandwich here. It has rich flavor and great texture. I don't personally drink much soda but the meal goes really well with Dr. Pepper. The fries are pretty generic but they have dressings and sauces you can use for them. The service has always been really good and they have always quickly addressed any concerns I've had."}
{"text":"Today I visited The Greek Pita for the second time.  On both visits I had the souvlaki (pork loin) sandwich combo.  At just under $10 total cost I cannot give The Greek Pita higher than 3 stars.

The food is good but not great.  For the same price one can get better gyro, shawarma or kebab sandwiches from a variety of other joints in Tempe (Tasty Kebab or Cafe Istanbul for example).

If you're already out at the Tempe Marketplace, however, this is a suitable dining option.  The food is cooked fresh so do expect to wait a few minutes, especially if there is a line."}
{"text":"I sit in a cubicle for 40 hours a week. My life is miserable during those hours. The one thing to lift my spiritis is Greek Pita. I dream that one day my cubicle will turn into Pita Bread with Hummus so I can eat it. I also think it is highly beneficial to have a long beard while going to Greek Pita as I came back from lunch and found a pita crumb with Hummus on my beard, needless to say I ate it."}
{"text":"Been to Its All Greek To Me twice now and both times have been very good! Quality gyro both times I went. My gf got the falafel plate which was also very tasty! Will probably be back again some time soon!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for a while now. Love their food and the fast service. Must try it !"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night for the first time before catching a movie screening, and it was delicious!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma is so good here and the sauce that comes with it is amazing. Everyone here is very friendly and even though they give me a number for my order, they still bring the food directly to the table."}
{"text":"Expensive for the quality. Taste was just ok and bill was $13 for 1 person! There wasn't enough leftover for another full meal. At $13, plus tip, the portions better be enormous, or amazingly delicious! I was torn to give it 2 or 3 stars. Bland pita....."}
{"text":"This place is pretty rockin. They have a gyro combo for $7.50. It comes with a gigantic and fully stacked gyro, a large side of french fries and a drink. Amazing plus...THEY.HAVE.RANCH! Score! This always excites me because a lot of these places serve fries but no ranch...anyway. the place is clean and the servers are nice. I was apparently confused when I was ordering because I almost ordered some plate with a bunch of meat...thankfully they explained what I was ordering before I paid so I could change my order..situation avoided.

Fast, great price, great food!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were hungry and undecided so we went to Tempe Marketplace to find something to eat and we decided on greek.

We all got the gyro and it came out looking delicious but its a little on the salty side for me. They didn't skimp out on the meat though which is good I guess? Who doesn't like more meat [:

Erms other then that, if I truly wanted some greek food, I rather go to haji baba [:"}
{"text":"I went to Greek Pita without doing a Yelp check.  Came out of the movies, saw the place and thought that spanokopita (spinach pie) would be a great snack before going to bed.  A spinach pie.  What could be bad about that?  Took an appetizer portion to go and drove home anxiously awaiting that delicious pie.  Opened the container and saw a bed of lettuce under it--nice, I thought. Then I made one mistake.  I lifted the spinach pie.  And there is was--- a pool of grease not only on the lettuce but on the entire bottom of the spinach pie.  It was shiny from the grease and four paper towels DID NOT absorb all of the grease on this unworthy pie.   So after shocking my husband with a view of this greasy mess, he shook his head and said:  You're not going to eat that are you?  I told him that I had to take a bite in order to do an accurate Yelp review.  He watched me to make sure it was only one bite.  After all, he didn't want to have to drive me to the hospital if I got sick or on a lighter note, have to get up from bed to get me the Pepto-bismol.  So I tasted it. It was not bad, but it was not good.  Not enough feta cheese and did I taste a bit of mozzarella in there?  That's not the Greek way of making it.  I know. I make it.  So my laziness of not making a tray of spanokopita led me to craving it and ending up with something my own kitchen would not produce.  Ever.  
So I give the spanokopita one star for the price.  A total of $2.44 with the tax.  BTW, after the bite taken on behalf of Yelp, the kitchen disposal totally enjoyed it.  GRRRRRRRRRRRRR.... I heard the disposal say----Is it mad at me??????"}
{"text":"You have to try pretty hard to mess up chicken shawarma, but these guys do it in spades. Every place I've ever had chicken shawarma, its made from chicken breast that's been roasted in and sliced from a shawarma cooker. This place however, uses cut chunks of thigh meat full of grisel and connective tissue. Seriously disgusting. And don't bother with a salad unless you like it swimming in dressing."}
{"text":"First things first: Yelp says this place is only open on Saturdays - it's definitely not true and hopefully it gets fixed soon. They're open everyday.

I go here weekly to grab lunch during work - I have yet to be disappointed. The chicken is always flavorful and I've never found it to be dry. The gyro is also on point and is served extremely fast!

In terms of price, if you get a plate combo then you can expect to pay about $12-$13.... But you get A LOT of food. It comes with tons of rice, pita with dipping sauce, a side salad, and a generous amount of whatever meat option your heart desires. I always have to take leftovers home when I order a plate. IMO, definitely not expensive considering all that you get.

Alternatively, you can get a value meal which consists of a pita sandwich with fries and a drink - typically about $10. The pita sandwich is nicely stuffed so I also can't complain about the price for those. Also, their fries are awesome - nothing special, just perfectly crisp on the outside and thick and \"meaty\" inside. Mmmm.

The only thing I would probably pass on are the salad entrées, just because I feel that there's almost TOO much vinaigrette on them. I tend to like my salads dry though, so I might just be an oddball in that regard."}
{"text":"My favorite Greek food place to eat. The employees there are really nice when we decided to walk in just a little before closing. I recommend trying their food out!"}
{"text":"Not too bad. Good portion of meat, but expected since their meat combos are a bit pricey. Not sure if it's a Greek thing or this restaurant, but the meat seemed over marinated. The citrus flavor was a bit overwhelming. Nice place to sit down with plenty of tables, a patio area, and and plentiful condiments."}
{"text":"This place has become a tradition for my wife and I whenever we're heading to see a movie at Tempe Marketplace.

It is DELICIOUS.  I usually get the Steak Shawarma and share French Fries with my wife.  There's always fast, courteous service, and the food is always great.  Plus, it's not too pricey.  For about $15 you can get two entrees, fries, and drinks.  Not too shabby.

Perfect if you're shopping or heading to a movie at Tempe Marketplace.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Typical menu of items you would expect in a Greek place.

This place was good, fast and really generous portion sizes.  It was inexpensive too!  The food was made fresh and served quickly and not much to complain about.  All in all I would go back again."}
{"text":"I love it here when I am on lunch break from work I come here and grab a bite to eat. The service is just always friendly and the food is soo flavorful. I love the fact that when I eat lunch I don't get the meal and I am not heavy full but just satisfied. P.s I hate to eat during lunch hour but this place is so good it changed my mind"}
{"text":"A little pricey for an everyday work lunch, but I really liked the food... so, I guess it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Nice and friendly employees! This place is always clean and the food tastes AMAZING! 

Definitely fresh and made when ordered! 

I love the chicken schwarma! (number 9) For about $9 you get a huge plate of whatever entree you order, huge amount of fries, and a drink! (Free refills) Yum yum! The fries are SO Crispy and hot! This is the place to be!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the Thunderbird location, and am very happy that they opened a sister location here. So good."}
{"text":"We love this place! We often make a special trip just to go eat there! Love their shish kabobs and the food portions are very big. The prices are reasonable and the staff is very nice and even the owner when he is there goes out of his way to say hello. We highly recommend eating there."}
{"text":"Not bad, price was good... for 1 gyro came to $5.70ish with tax and it was a decent size, filled me up for sure.  Service for take out was quick so I would definitely try this place out again."}
{"text":"Always fantastic and the people who work there are so nice,  I love going there. Their steak Shawarma plate is the best!"}
{"text":"First time at Tempe Marketplace and they have a decent selection of faster food by the theatre. Ended up at this greek place and it was a good choice. Price was about $6.50 for a pita sandwich  (combo was $2.25 more). I chose the Chicken Kabob pita which is the best one if you prefer chicken breast like myself. It is a tasty pita stuffed with about 10 long strips of nicely marinated chicken (lemon, spices) and then onions, tomatoes and I chose Greek style which is feta and tziiki sauce. The chicken was freshly grilled as I listened and the sandwich was a quick eat, fairly healthy and good flavors as well."}
{"text":"FALAFELS!!!!!! ok seriously not as green as I am used too, but wow!!! Amazing food, and that pink garlic sauce is great... try dipping your fries in it... stole a slice of gyro from my friend- perfectly seasoned clear through. Can't wait to come back..."}
{"text":"This is the best gyro restaurant in Arizona. I love the food, staff are always nice, place is very clean, and prices are very fair. As a restaurant owner, I give this restaurant a 5 star and if you are going to have gyro, its the only place that does it right."}
{"text":"So good! We always get the meat gyro (lamb), Greek salad, and their French fries are awesome. Chicken shawarma is great too. Service is quick and staff are all friendly. Can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Really good wrap place. They have a large assortment of menus items that is pretty straight forward. The place is nice and open with lots of seating. The chair are a bit odd and not the most comfortable to sit in but the benches are nice. It's cool that they are open pretty late. I really like that. You can eat, hangout and talk with friends. 

The employees were nice and even gave us recommendations on what to get. They can answer any questions about the food. So they know their stuff.

You have to park pretty far away of course. But there is a lot to see in this area. If you are just stopping by to get some food don't let that deter you from coming by.

I would recommend this place for everyone to try out. The food is good and the environment is nice."}
{"text":"Just had my first gyros from here.  It was huge and loaded with meat.  Very flavorful. My only regret, I should have ordered extra tzatziki sauce. There wasn't nearly enough. Order extra..even if you put it on the side."}
{"text":"I simply love gyro's especially coming from New York and It's all Greek to me did not disappoint! The staff is friendly, the establishment is clean and the food is delicious! The falafel was fried to the perfect crisp with savory seasonings. Now the gyro wrap was perfection and the portions were filling and just the right amount for a nice afternoon of shopping. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. This was our first time here . Ordered chicken Gyros with fries and Greek salad. Salad was large enough to share with my husband and was also very tasty. We will be back again next time we are out near Tempe Market place."}
{"text":"Very surprised how satisfying the Greek Pita was.  First place in a long time that actually had Shawarma on the menu.  While not Middle Eastern quality, it was good.  Side of fries just average.  But got a side of very good hummus to put on sandwich.  Will go back to try the falafel."}
{"text":"Looks good and busy when you walk in...but in my opinion the quality of the food is...lacking. Fish and chips tasted and looked so generic like out of the freezer at Frys or Safeway. The Falafel was not the best at all. Left most of it on the table. sorry....."}
{"text":"Steak shawarma plate is amazing.  Garlic sauce Is unreal also.  Big fan of this place and you get a ton of food for the money!"}
{"text":"I was so surprised to find such a great little Greek restaurant in this setting after going to the movie.  I mentioned it to my friend that I was surprised to see ethnic people running an ethnic restaurant in a mall type of place.  It is pretty apparent that this little restaurant is family owned and operated and for Greek food this is the only way to go.  Everything, in my opinion was excellent.   The gyro was of a flavor that couldn't have been better and the way it was served met that.  My friend has a salad that to me met the standards a person should be looking for if they want what it was called-a Greek salad.  It would be nice if there had been a bazuki player but for a mall sort of setting, one can only ask so much, right?

This restaurant is not near my home, but I know the next time I go to see a movie, I probably will drive to Tempe just so I can eat at It's all Greek to Me afterward."}
{"text":"I used to love Thus place when it was Greek pita. Now their food isn't all that great."}
{"text":"I was here before years ago with prior owner. Service was great. Very friendly. Food was really good. Got the hummus. Yummy. Tried their fries. Different but tasty. Loved their gyros."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan. The food is overpriced for the quality. The chicken shawarma came with one very small container of garlic sauce, which was not nearly enough to cover the dry chicken. The meals don't come with hummus or any other sauces. The quantity of rice was substantial but maybe just to make it look like more food than you actually receive. The falafels were also extremely dry and bland. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I had the steak Shawarma wrap, meal. Over all good food, one of my favs!!! The food is just right for taste, best sauce when it comes to the wrap."}
{"text":"eould have given 100 stars ..
Hands Down the best Gyro I've ever had and the Greek fries are also out of this world. They also remodeled and the place looks outstanding! Staff was also friendly and efficient!
I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went here a few years ago and thought it was delicious but moved away so I wasn't able to go again till I moved back into the Tempe area. I went today again because I remembered how great the food was there and I am 100% satisfied with what I got. It was a steak gyro with a side salad and a medium drink all for 10$ it was so yummy and it was a really good size amount of food! I sure will be coming back more often, and I highly recommend going and trying it for your self"}
{"text":"Good food was pleasantly surprised!  The chicken kabob was good and the Gyro was great.  Only reason we didn't give it 5 stars is there wasn't enough lettuce in the Gyro.  Other then that great!  Good service and location!"}
{"text":"I always get the shawarma salad with chicken it is a very good portion but is a little expensive. The salad is packed with different layers of flavor. I always want to drink the dressing that is left over  The hummus Is very tasty and I always appreciate a place that offers wheat pitas. Everything here is packed with flavor ask for a side of there hot Greek sauce. It a nice spin on salsa!"}
{"text":"Foods great!

What threw me off was the people who work here. The literally sat in a booth, on their phones and awkwardly looked at you. 

Not my idea of professional but whatevs.

Rather would drive a little further to George's. Great customer service and AMAZING food."}
{"text":"Very mediocre food for the price. The portion sizes are decent but not really worth it. We had the hummus with chicken shawarma and pita bread. The pita was good (hence the 2 stars), the hummus was average but not bad. It was the shawarma that ruined it all. 
First of all it was not sliced the way shawarma should be, it was just large chunks of meat. Secondly it was thigh meat and barely cooked. It had that horrible gamey poultry flavor and that weird soft bite of undercooked meat. Maybe we just got a bad batch. I will give them the benefit of the doubt but would I ever get chicken shawarma from here again? Nope"}
{"text":"This place has the best gyros we've had since we moved to Arizona! They were huge and the meat was delicious. The Greek fries were also very good!!"}
{"text":"Chicken gyro and a regular gyro.......good as it gets. I wasn't blown away by any means, but it was good and reasonable priced. Glad we ate here before going into the movies!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite and frequent spots for lunch. You must try it out!!! If you're looking for sign if you should eat here: EAT HERE!!! I always get the chicken shawarma plate; it's Greek heaven in every bite. It comes with hummus, a side salad, pita bread and rice. Also, don't forget to request the pink garlic sauce, it's beyond amazing. The staff is really nice and welcoming, and the prices are definitely worth the value and taste! Also their Gyro pita is very delicious; feels like you're ordering one in NYC. It's also one of their lunch special items."}
{"text":"I come here often!! This place gets five stars every time, it's honestly better than Pita Jungle! My favorite order is the chicken kabob wrap with extra garlic sauce on the side for the fries. In my experience, my order has always been right, the meat is always tender, and the staff is super helpful. Portions are a good size, and there's a lot of selection in the menu. It's good for take out as well! I find that it's money always well spent to go. Not to mention it's the only location, so support local!"}
{"text":"Well, the gyro meat was tender and tasty, the rice was was flavorful and the pita was good, but the hummus was gross and somewhat runny and the salad was limp and nearly ready to be tossed. The food here is usually better than this, so I'll be back."}
{"text":"Very good.  Quick, tasty, fresh.  There are 2 reasons for the lower star review:

1) it is a bit expensive.

2) MUST leave a tip."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I've been going here for years. Get the steak kabob. I like that they updated the furniture too"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, but not the best I've had. Both rice and meat were a little dry, but full of flavor. Pita was soft and warm, which was really nice. Price wasn't terrible, but I've definitely had cheaper Greek/Mediterranean which was just as good if not better. The staff was super nice and made small talk while preparing the order, which gave more of a welcoming feel. I will definitely try this place again - I'm hoping maybe I went in on an off day and just had some food that was a little over cooked."}
{"text":"The service was great & the food was fantastic! My only complaint was that I've had better pita bread elsewhere. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love Greek, but I'm on a budget. This is definately budget food! I mean, there's no tip because it's fast food. They prepare it fresh, but serve it expendiently. They have good Tahini sauce. They have good lamb. You can get a side of falafel that tastes really good for $3 and share with everyone. Their pitas are filling. They have food that crosses over into Middle Eastern. Good variety on the menu. I used to go to the Pita Jungle or the way more expensive My Big Fat Greek restaurant three miles west, but for the food and prices, this place hits the spot. Opa!"}
{"text":"Probably more like 3 1/2 stars, but since Yelp won't recognize the half-star, this is what I have to work with.

Been here a few times when needing to go to Marketplace.  The pitas are pretty good, the staff is friendly, so no complaints.  Good alternative to a burger place!"}
{"text":"This is a great place....sooooooo much food (Large portions) The menu is clear and percise and plenty of options.  I will definitely be making a repeat visit to this establishment, I will be recommending this business to all of my Yelp Friends. 

BTW, I ordered the Gyro plate enough food for two people."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was phenomenal! I had the chicken shawarma salad and  they were able to customize my toppings with ease! The waitress/cashier was extremely accommodating and friendly! I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"One of the first places I choose to go when hungry! :) Love their chicken salad and chicken kebab"}
{"text":"Fast service and generous amount of serving! First time here and definitely coming back. I tried the chicken gyro plate and I guess I have a new favorite now!"}
{"text":"Always delicious! Food tastes great, good portions and decent price! Maybe open more locations??"}
{"text":"Came here recently. Wasn't a big fan. Their gyro was pretty basic, meat had good flavor but nothing really stood out to me as special. Greek fries....abysmal. Paid over $4 for a small children size portion of fries with some feta on top....not even any herbs? Hopefully this place can start giving bigger portions for their price point."}
{"text":"I love this place, best Greek food I've ever had and a very friendly staff. I highly recommend this place and make sure to try the Falafel sandwich!!!!!"}
{"text":"We first stumbled across the Greek Pita in a non-descript strip mall behind Best Buy on Thunderbird.  Had low expectations, but the food was great.  We then saw that they had a spot at the Tempe Marketplace, so we paid them a visit.  

The food is great - the shawerma chicken is beautifully marinated, and their salad dressing is great. The hot sauce is worth paying for too!  It's weird that they have hot dogs, burgers, and french fries on the menu, but the Greek stuff they sell is pretty darned good! We've been 3 weeks in a row!"}
{"text":"Had never tired Greek food before until now definitely recommend this place!  I tired the chicken gyro was delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"I can only handle Greek cuisine once in a while.  Is it me or do you feel heavier and a tad bit overweight after some gyros?  and fries ... and a medium coke? :)  Yeah, I know it's the voices in my head (make them stop!)  Anyways, this place is right in the food court.  I'm not a big fan of food courts in general, but I'll survive.  I thought the gyros were pretty basic.  It wasn't too bad but then again it didn't really wow my taste buds.  Order some hot dogs and hamburgers and you're in the wrong joint (it'll take a good 15 mins!)  This is just one of the 3 locations for this franchise so I gather they do pretty well.  This location is definitely for the quick (I only have 30 mins lunch break) customers.  - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"They remodeled the inside and made it look more colorful, modern, and yes, more Greek-like, and with that remodel came a name change. Still the same great food though. I've tried several things on the menu now, from the chicken and steak schwarmas to the kabob wrap to the side of gyro, and I have no complaints. Always a quality meal. The staff have been very kind thus far, and the military/veteran discount is always a nice touch. 

Keep up the good work guys, because 'it's all great to me'!"}
{"text":"The individual gyro was pretty big and delicious. Not bad for $7 and plenty of meat. I would say this is a good place for food at Tempe Marketplace. I think the other places are more expensive and not a lot of food with the exception of Chipotle. Glad it's not drenched in sauce but you can get more sauce if you want. I haven't tried the other items but the gyro gets my thumbs up."}
{"text":"Amazing food. THE most delicious meat gyro in the valley, great amount of meat not greasy, well spiced and flavored. Fresh onion and Lettuce and tomato, the sauce compliments the gyro perfectly, and the fries are just the best. But there is always the same problem the meat is not hot enough 
Thank you"}
{"text":"This is my first time here. Gyro is great. Best Ive had in a long time. Cook to order but fast. Inside and outside dining."}
{"text":"The food was expensive, and tasteless. The chicken shawarma was dry. The tables were dirty,  which surprised me as the staff clears the table. I won't return."}
{"text":"Definitely not what I was expecting. They had only one veggie option - falafel warp or falafel salad. Neither comes with hummus, talk about huge disappointment. I had to order hummus separately, and I was not impressed. It personally tasted store bought to me. The actual falafels tasted too salty, but they were definitely fresh. I love greek places because they always have a special spicy sauce, but they didn't here. They only had tabasco. 

Overall, I wouldn't come back, but tons of other people seemed to love. People were constantly in and out while I was there."}
{"text":"Great food and nice staff. We've eaten here numerous times while at the Tempe Marketplace and we like how you can sit outside if you want to. Everything we've ordered has been good but we especially like the gyros and the steak kabob pita. We highly recommend this place and look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner and was very impressed with the food and service. Everyone was polite and very welcoming. My kids enjoyed the falafel wraps. I had the shawarma it was delicious.  The place was clean and inviting (huge portions)"}
{"text":"Haven't found a Greek place that I enjoy more than this one. wish it was closer to my house cuz I have to drive pretty far but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I had been here before and wasn't that impressed.  But they have really stepped up their game.  They have remodeled the interior and their menu a bit as well. I came with my husband and 1 year old for their $1 gyro and shawarma promotion.  We were expecting crowds and a long wait but the while the line was long it was well staffed and organized.  We got our food extremely fast. It was fresh, well seasoned and delicious.  I got the chicken shawarma wrap and my husband got 2 gyros to share with the baby. She scarfed it down and asked for more.  The chicken was juicy and the sauce was flavorful. The pitas were soft and chewy. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Enter nearly every Pita joint in the world: Mykonos posters and Coca Cola ads plastering the walls, with a big spinning lamb shank in the back. This one is no different. 

I arrived about 45 minutes before they closed and was asked what I want. I ordered the #1, a gyro with fries. The cashier told me not to throw any garbage away in the garbage cans because the bags cost three dollars a piece. 'Wow, this business is getting really ripped off on garbage bags' was the first thing I thought.

The food came out quickly and the pita was okay, if a bit sloppy. The tomatoes were strangely cut as well, like huge quarter-cuts. The fries were goddamn miserable. Half of them were still frozen. I later figured out it was because they wanted us to get the hell out, as I turned around right after walking outside and they locked the door on us, and refused to let me refill my drink.

The real shame was having to walk into the new Tom Cruise snoozer 'Oblivion' with those horrific frozen fries firmly mashed into my teeth. 

Thanks for a good time Greek Pita!"}
{"text":"Ordered two gyros, it was the best meat I have ever had! The service was friendly. If I lived here it would be one of our regular spots!"}
{"text":"I ordered the gyros pita after being told it was something % lamb and something % beef and would come with a special sauce that I would love. What I got was a lot of beef in pita bread. I didn't taste ANY lamb (that's why I had ordered a gyros in the first place...for the lamb). The only distinct flavor in the sauce was dill. Oh well, it is what it is."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many different Greek restaurants, this is one of my top favorites ! Everything they serve here is cooked and seasoned perfectly from the chicken swarma to the beef kabobs.  The beef kabobs are the best I've had. The portions are enough for two meals and all the plates come with hummus and a warm pita.  The atmosphere is really quaint and very clean.  There is seating inside and out and the staff are always very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I used to really love this place... I went in today after, I guess it's just a name change, and it didn't taste as awesome as it usually does and I asked for the two meat combo chicken and steak and the chicken was not what I normally get (shawarma but what I got was not strips it was chunks) and tasted a bit tangy not really what I wanted. The steak was still good and flavorful. I always dip it into the garlic sauce. This time though I got hummus and I never got that before I guess now it comes with the meal. I took off a star because my meal with a drink was like $17 waayyy to much. So I do recommend this place however I suggest you eat there or outside while the food is fresh. The quality suffers if you wait a while to eat it."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Had the gyro (wonderful sauce) and chicken combo plate. Great, helpful service, and fresh-tasting food.  Located so conveniently right out the theaters at Tempe Marketplace."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE!!!!

The flavor is fantastic and while the chef's would likely be scalped by Gordon Ramsey for their inaccurate knife cuts, who the Hell care? My stomach sure doesn't! While it may not be pretty, it's pretty damn tasty and a definite score of 5!

Amazing find in Tempe Marketplace!"}
{"text":"Amazing Gyros! Love Love Love this Place!  Great Location - Amazing Food - Upbeat and Friendly Staff - Incredible Value!  - I've met colleagues at this location as well as my college age son - we popped in before we went to the movies.  Everyone I've taken has always commented on how great the food is and we are always stuffed when we leave!"}
{"text":"This place was great.  I love noticing the small differences between the shwarma and hummus when going to places like these.   At this place they gave us two types of pita; the normal thin warm pita I'm used to dipping into hummus and then another very thick piece that was also great.  I've never had anything like that but it was good.  I know it has a name because it came on a different plate.  The Greek salad was very Greek.  Lot's of lemon which is the way we like it.  Here was the best part for us...next to the cash register they have what appears to be home made baklava.  It was amazing.  Nice and crisp with plenty of honey.  Check it out folks, especially if you're waiting for a movie at the Tempe Marketplace."}
{"text":"This place rocked it. They were even speaking greek.. I think... (could've been Spanish). The gyro here was one of the best I have had in a long time . I haven't been to Greece but this was really tastey, huge, and cheap. The guys here were freindly , the open kitchen was cool, and it was relatively clean. Go here if you find yourself around the market place."}
{"text":"So good!  Ordered the Gyro meat plate to go, and while they forgot the extra tzatziki I paid for (honest mistake), the portions were huge and the flavors delicious!  Asked for no pita in the order and they were able to accommodate (severe gluten issue - crumbs enough to ruin a meal and my night).  Happy to say that I'm full after eating about half the meal, and have leftovers for lunch tomorrow!  I'll certainly be back - and will make sure I get that extra tzatziki!"}
{"text":"We order Two lamb gyro wraps. Really good! Staff there are very friendly too. They have a Greek desert, I want to try next time. My Greek mom used to make a similar one. Place very clean, I'm glad we were there early, for sure getting busier after we ordered. Will go back try hummus."}
{"text":"I consider myself to be somewhat of a falafel and hummus expert, so whenever I try a new greek/middle eastern place, that's where I like to start. The hummus was above average....not super creamy and quite flavorful in all the familiar ways. Now the falafel....that was different than any I have had. They tasted pretty standard (don't get me wrong, they were quite tasty), but it was the texture that surprised me.  Lightly crunchy on the outside, but fluffy and LIGHTER THAN AIR on the inside.  I can't even find words to describe beyond that.   I loooooved them and look forward to trying their shawarma next time."}
{"text":"Holy cow . This place was such a surprise being in the Tempe market place food court . The Hercules platter with steak shwarma is a game changer . Tender Steak with warm pita and excellent hummus . And it's massive . The traditional gyro is the best I've had here . We get these two dishes with sides of their delicious garlic sauce and split them every time . I drive 10 minutes atleast once a week to eat here it's that good . If you're within a 10 mile radius make the trip to Its all Greek to me . It will not disappoint !"}
{"text":"I went to this place at closing time for grabbing a quick bite. The Falafel was very bad. And the Greek Fries were sour and I didn't like the taste of either that I ordered."}
{"text":"Ok food, rude employee. Went once to meet a friend who was hungry. I had already eaten and felt that I was too full to order. The worker at the register made fun of me and passive-aggressively told me to order. I didn't think much of it and just laughed it off and told him I already ate. We sat down and I forgot about it until we got up to leave and as we were walking out, the same douchebag came out to the register again and yelled for me to order next time (jokingly HAHA.) I just left feeling annoyed and it made me not want to come back and give them my money."}
{"text":"I love this place! Super kind staff and helpful in deciding what to get as a first time customer. I got a gyro wrap, Greek fries and falafel. I feel like most places I go to have a lot of grease but everything was cooked perfectly. Not too greasy. So delicious! I'd definitely recommend this to anyone hanging out at Tempe marketplace and I will be back."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best go to places if you are looking for a good tasting pita or kebab plate. Service is fast and the place is clean."}
{"text":"I love greek food and I am middle eastern, this place is awesome! Service is here has been so friendly every single time, price is right and the food is delicious. The french fries are exactly the way I remember french fries being outside of the US. I can't explain it, they are the perfect size, the perfect amount of crunchy but soft and were cooked in the perfect amount of oil. No shoestring gross, oily fries here!!! This has become our favorite go to place to grab a quick bite before going to the movies. Try the souvlaki or shwarma combos!"}
{"text":"Great food, great price!!! The fries are really good and I recommend the Greek salad with chicken. The music goes hard too."}
{"text":"In town visiting and stopped in before a movie. Gyro Salad was great and LARGE portion. Great service. Andre is the best!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  Visited on a Friday evening.  Ordered the chicken kebab pita combo with a side of the tzaziki.  First, fries were coated with a dusting of some seasoning that leaves the fries crunchy, they were warm and soft on the inside.  The combo also came with a large drink, so I opted for the raspberry tea.  Now, the star of the show was the chicken.  Large chunks of perfectly spiced chicken.  It had lime flavors and that char on the outside.  The garlic sauce was a little runny and the onion was large but the tomatoe was fresh tasting and thin.  The pita was soft and the tzakiki sauce was not strong and had little chunks of cucumber, smooth yogurt sauce.  I will definitely come again and probably order the same thing.  I saw a few people come in and pick up, like they had ordered to go which I think would be a great idea for a weekday dinner.  Big portions and worth the $10.  I sat outside because it was a nice weather night and we like to people watch!!"}
{"text":"I love Greek Food!! So I've tried a lot of places... The prices may be. Little higher but a few more dollars aren't bad for the food food you will receive. 

This time I got the Steak Shawarma and the meat was so flavorful, didn't need sauce or anything. I usually eat it with Pita and the Tzatziki sauce. Favorite!! The Greek Fries are always good, can't really mess those up. Iran they could have been a little more crispier, but with all the ingredients in them they are bound to get soggy. 

The place seems to be fairly busy, I'm never the only one dining in. Also the staff is friendly and fun!! I mean for being a \"food court\" food establishment, it's better then most. I go often and would recommend it if asked..."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant while in Tempe and I'm glad I did.  The food was delicious! The hummus was fresh and the chicken kabob was bursting with flavor.  Friendly gal working the counter and fast service.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the prices are too high. While the nearly $9 dollars I spent on a Shawarma combo isn't too outrageous, the size of the pita is pretty small, and for a couple more dollars there are several quality Middle Eastern and Greek places close to Tempe Marketplace that are considerably better. There are also many quicker, cheaper, and better options inside The District. 

The Shawarma Pita contained well marinated and cooked chicken thighs, fresh veggies, and an awesome sauce. Disappointingly small for the price, but actually the perfect size for a filling sandwich. The fries are mediocre. I'd suggest skipping them and just going for the sandwich (this will save a little bit of coin, too). Paying a little more for quality doesn't bother me, but I can't say this was worth it.

I only decided to check out The Greek Pita because I was already at Tempe Marketplace, and had never eaten there. If you happen to be there and have a craving for Mediterranean food, then by all means give it a try. But The Greek Pita is definitely not a destination eating spot."}
{"text":"My Egyptian roommate got me into Greek/Arabic food a couple years back and I have never looked back. Whenever and wherever I can find it, I dig in. I have to say this place may just be the best. My kefta sandwich with Greek fries and that garlic sauce...truly inspirational. WOW"}
{"text":"Okay yum! I cannot believe I had never been to It's All Greek To Me after living in Tempe the past three and a half years. I got a plate with chicken kabob, rice, hummus, and pita! I really enjoyed my meal and thought the portion sizes were great. It was definitely fresh, tasty and flavorful! I will for sure keep It's All Greek To Me in mind for take out or a quick and easy lunch! Great experience :)"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! Excellent Greek food, fast service, friendly staff and clean. This is not your typical greasy Greek spot and my son and I love it! The flavors are full, bold and most importantly FRESH. I usually order grilled chicken with French fries and a chicken shawarma with hummus and fresh Greek salad. Yummy! Comfortable open atmosphere great for lunch and dinner. I love that I can shop all around Tempe Marketplace and make a quick stop here before heading home. I would recommend this place to anyone if asked.."}
{"text":"I was hungry and in Tempe Marketplace shopping. I walked around and was deciding between a noodle place and The Greek Pita. I checked out the menu and the pitas here looked legit, so I walked in to try out some pita sandwiches.

The menu is varied and the main meats they have are chicken (dark and white meat), gyro meat, kafta kabob (Ground meat kabob), battered fish, and they also have falafel as a vegetarian option. They offer plates, pita sandwiches, and combination deals which include a sandwich, drink, and fries.

I went with the #10: A marinated chicken breast pita with tomatoes, onions, and lettuce. You have your choice of garlic or Greek sauce- I went with the garlic. It was delivered in a short amount of time and looked and smelled amazing. It was served with a mountain of fries. It tasted excellent. The cool vegetables went well with the marinated, grilled chicken and the garlic sauce meshed well with the rest of the sandwich. The chicken itself was perfectly seasoned, and tender. The only slight negative was that the onions were all piled in one area of the pita, so there were a few bites were all I was biting into was pita bread and onion. 

Service was friendly, and while the restaurant is small they manage to pack quite a few booths and 2-seater tables into the area. There is also a limited amount of outdoor seating. 

While the interior smells great from all the grilled food, your clothes might smell of grilled Greek style meats for a bit if you dine in.

I'll definitely come here again for their excellent Greek food."}
{"text":"Pretty Good.  Pretty Good!

Normally Gyros, falafel, and tzatziki give me indigestion.  But this time, it did not.  

The spanakopita was alright.  But the Falafel, gyro, and fries were tasty!  And I swear, the guys behind the couner were actually Greek!"}
{"text":"Menu was easy to order, but after they entered my order, their POS (point of sale) system wanted me to enter in a tip. For what?? I tip for good service and asked the cashier if they will clean up my plates when they are done. She said no. So what is the tip for?? Chick fil'a brings my food out too without expecting a tip. What makes them think they can get a tip from me? For brining my food to the table? lol

The owners that were cooking never had a smile on their face and gave me dirty looks the entire time I was there. Like I was lucky to be in their place. Maybe this is how you act in Greece, but it's not how we like it in the USA.

The pita they serve was exactly like the store bought pita you can buy from costco. The meat was okay. Nothing that stands out about this place. There are much better fast food places to eat at right next door in the tempe marketplace."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Clean, nice decor, friendly service and they made our gyro and salad exactly how we asked."}
{"text":"The first time we ate here we did not realize we would be trying a new favorite! We have had gyro meat,wraps, hummus, Greek fries, rice, salad, and falafel ... all fantastic!  By far, the best falafel I have ever tasted. I crave it all the time now and highly recommend trying it here if you're a falafel fan!  
Most of all, I want to talk about the portions here. Every time I have eaten here I have had to leave food behind! The portions are SO generous; you will definitely feel you got your money's worth. Great place to have lunch or dinner while at Tempe Marketplace if you enjoy Greek food. 

Give it a shot, you will not leave hungry!"}
{"text":"I think this place is amazing! The staff are super friendly and cook delicious food. Every time I come in I'm welcomed by the cashier and she remembers my order which makes me feel special given hundreds of people come through here daily! Would definitely recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great place with amazing food and friendly staff. Very clean and they do care for customer service in case anything wasn't ok."}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly and helpful! But the food is even better! I ordered the chicken shawarma (highly recommend!!!) and the falafel. Their hummus is amazing too. I'm from the valley and have grown up eating Pita Jungle, but It's All Greek To Me might be better!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for fast food beef schwaramas.  Amazing because it's in a mall.  Drop in and give them a try and you will not be disappointed.  

And, yes, I'd suggest getting something besides the fries on the side.  The fries are a bit soggy, but I shouldn't be eating french fries anyway."}
{"text":"I went here for a quick bite today... Never been here so didn't know quite what to expect. You can't really see the menu from the side of the counter where you order, but as soon as I walked up to the counter a girl came out, very helpful to help me order. I got the gyro plate which comes with the original gyro meat, Pita bread, rice & a Greek salad.  My food was ready so fast, like 5 minutes!  I took my food to go since I live right around the corner.  I got home and opened my food... Wow! Definitely enough food for two!! The meat was a little salty but balanced out with lots of tyziki sauce, some of the meat seemed a little dry. The rice was light and delicious. The salad was amazing and the feta tasted very fresh. I only wish they would have included veggies (tomato, cucumber, lettuce) for the pita as the pita is basically only pita bread, meat & sauce. I would come here again!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here for the first time today through UberEats!!! Great Gyros!!!! Tons of meat and delicious! The fries were good, even though they were delivered. Next time I will just stick to ordering the Gyros and get the extra sauce too!!!"}
{"text":"Super good Mediterranean at Tempe Market Place! We got the chicken Shwarma plate that was TONS of food and so flavorful! I've had much better hummus but the Shwarma was so tender and the rice was bursting with flavor! I'd definitely come back. Great bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Ordered the chicken schawarma plate with rice. Service was timely, food was warm and amount of food was good. Taste was so so. Chicken was tasty however rice was bland, if i were to eat here again I'd order the Greek fries. I'll sum up by saying it's a typical fast food type eatery. Don't expect anything more. Thumbs up for the pink garlic sauce."}
{"text":"I tried this place a few times. 
Love the chicken kabob and the Greek salad. 
The French fries are the best. I definitely recommend it. Friendly staff and nice experience overall."}
{"text":"They had a special today for 1 dollar gyros. Arrived just as the line was cutting off, had driven 15 mins to get there. Called the store and asked if they could help a disabled vet and his family get in line. Manager was more than happy to, walked out to tell the guards to let my family in. Food was amazing, really appreciated the service. You should definitely try this place if you're in the area. Best gyro I've had in the phoenix metropolitan area. Worth full price, you'll see us again soon enough!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it two stars because the food was amazing on the way down. That is, until the food poisoning kicked in 12 hours later. I called to let them know that I had gotten sick...the girl who answered apologized. Buuuut she said a manager would get in touch...they never did...which is why I'm writing this now. I didn't want my money back I definitely didn't want free food. I just wanted to make someone in charge aware of the situation so no one else got sick. So needless to say I will never be going back there..."}
{"text":"Tasty gyros, and lots of it! They serve Kronos from Chicago, shaved right off the spit so you know it's authentic. And they really pile on the meat, too! The tsaziki sauce was freshly made, too. I could see myself coming here more often, if only I lived closer..."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now.  The service is friendly and fast.  I love how tender their steak is as well as the seasoning they marinate it in.  I had the Steak Shawarma with fries.  It was delicious.  We also ordered a side of their Falafel.  Which I am not usually a fan of but their recipe is delicious.   I also love their many choices Coke machine they have in their store.  Pick any flavor combination.  I will visit again when I'm at tempe market place.  Great place."}
{"text":"I did not expect to have such an amazing gyro at Tempe Marketplace. I was very impressed with their hummus and tzatziki sauce. I will definitely be back to try the entire menu. Also, the blue-haired checkout girl will melt your heart ;)"}
{"text":"The lettuce from the salad is frozen, even after ten minutes of not touching it. The chicken is a little dry. The rice is either over cooked or reheated leftovers. The rug in the front entrance is filthy. The chairs are full of dust. I realize this is just mall food but I'm a big believer in Yelp and telling the truth."}
{"text":"It's not often to come by such an amazing Gyro place. Truly I was BLOWN away. Food was beyond amazing and so incredibly flavorful. The service was great and very friendly informative staff. My family will make sure to stop in way more often. For our first time we were nothing short of amazed!"}
{"text":"The staff is always super friendly and polite. The food is amazing!!! If you're looking for a place to catch up with old friends and have a delicious meal as well this is the best place to go."}
{"text":"Better food for what you typically find in a mall food court-ish I'd say a top 5. I was pretty damn hungry given that I had a light breakfast. So I chose a chicken schwarmra plate. That came with rice, pita, Greek salad and garlic sauce. I also got and appetizer order of falafel. The falafel was some of the best I've had. It was nice and crispy outside and spicy and moist inside. The schwarmra was also wonderful and the salad and rice that accompanied it were good too. Prices were also really good. When I find myself in Phoenix again I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Service and prices here aren't too good, but the food is fantastic! I have come here numerous times and have always had the best food experience. The chicken kabobs are cooked to perfection and they give you a lot of food! I also like the decor as well; but the service is just BAD, every single time I come here we get ignored for a few minutes before having someone finally help and that seems to be the case with everyone else I have seen in line. I would give this place a solid 5 stars if not for the not-so-good service and high prices."}
{"text":"Only a few times have I had this quality of gyro, fresh rice and buttery soft pita.  I'm impressed and will recommend this place for its quality food.  Love their fries with the coating and crispness.  I don't always understand having fries as an option but I will get them next time.  The rice is soft, flavorful and moist.  Cannot say enough about the fresh, soft and tasty pita bread.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Went in to get a bite, not busy at all. Nobody in line. I'm standing at the counter for 60 seconds. Both guys behind the counter have noticed me standing there. My a single word. Never did they mention it would be a minute. Never did they ask how I could be helped.

I went elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food is totally not worth the price they are charging. We ordered a gyro meat wrap combo and the steak shawarma plate. The gyro meat and fries were pretty decent hence the  2 stars, however the steak shawarma was terrible!! Firstly the cut of the meat was no where close to how shawarma is cut. It was just huge chunks of steak meat overly marinated in some citrusy flavor (i'm guessing vinegar - not sure though). The hummus was salty and there was an overpowering flavor of tahini. Not sure if this is how the Greek shawarma & hummus taste but we did not enjoy it at all. We could barely get past two bites of this plate. We were just glad we had the gyro meat wrap too which was edible. There are much better places out there serving similar cuisine. I probably would not go back here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite, staff was very friendly. I ordered just a regular meat Gyro. Food came very fast barely got a chance to check all my social media! lol. If you like mediterranean/greek food this is a great spot for a lunch on the go."}
{"text":"I loved the food which is most important one of the best shwarma plates ive had since i moved here the chicken was delicious the steak so juicy and perfectly seared. Everything was great i liked the dudes were having fun in the kitchen singing and the food came out fast. It was clean inside not crazy amount of room but im not shocked the place was full because this food was fire. Overall after all these ratings i really dont need to say pero if you want the flama its here ."}
{"text":"I was on my way back from the library trying to catch some food at Tempe Market Place late at night.  I was at the door at 9:59, and they were still willing to serve me.  I give them an extra star for this.  I got the chicken kebab plate.  In all honesty, I was not paying attention to cost since I was very hungry, but I was very surprised by the final total bill.  I think the price too much for Greek plates.  I would normally pay this much if I was at a sit down Greek Restaurant like My Big Fat Greek."}
{"text":"This place is in the food court area of Tempe Marketplace close to Chipotle. I meet up with a friend here for lunch occasionally who is nuts about gyros. She says that these are not the best but they are ok but a little pricey for fast food. I got a Greek salad with chicken shawarma meat plus a regular iced tea for $13."}
{"text":"Great, simple greek food and decent sized portions and one of the best pitas I have had in the valley. The pink garlic sauce is super too. Get your grub here before a movie!"}
{"text":"The food is really really good.
The price not so much.
Pretty much plan on spending about $10 per person here (give or take).
If the price was better I'd give this place a full 5 stars because the food actually tastes fresh. Fries were crispy, their sauce they use is pink (which I thought weird)  but it's the best I've tasted and the Pita bread is nice and fluffy soft. 
I'd definitely come back to splurge."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Fresh - clean. And they play great music. I order the 2 plate combo. Absolutely worth the money .

The music is upbeat. The sauces are delicious"}
{"text":"Outstanding mediterranean food. Had the chicken and steak kabobs and was impressed. Perfectly seasoned and quickly prepared. This is my fav gyro place too."}
