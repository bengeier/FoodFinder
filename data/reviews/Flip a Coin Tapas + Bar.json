{"text":"I get what they are trying to do but no, just no.  Lo Mein: all I can taste was salty and burnt black bean sauce. No other flavour.  Slider: mediocre donggrangtang like patty with kimchi. It's okay but it's mix of flavours that just doesn't work together.   Tofu cracker: salty cracker you can buy at any asian super marker topped with tofu and bland mayo based sauce. Tofu was well cooked but not worth $1.75 a bite  Cod: after all the super salty dishes, all I can taste was fishy fat. Low quality nori had no taste and the cooking method and the sauce doesn't compliment the fish but rather amplify the fishy tasting fat too much.  The idea of this place is noble but the execution is poor at best. Food is either too salty to taste anything else or flavours just don't work together, especially for bite sized tapas."}
{"text":"If you wanna try fusion food, this is a must go place. My favourite dish is cool capellini and mini flip. Will definite come back!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food, nice service and great location.  Love this place, definitely will come back."}
{"text":"This Asian inspired fusion tapas joint is a hidden gem in Port Credit... literally. Since it is a new start-up and not at the prime location east of it, people may not even realize the establishment exists. However, good food and the passion of a group of all-girl crew would surprise everyone. I have been to many joints where portion vs value would be major turn-off, if not the selections and quality are mediocre. Flip-A-Coin menu items may sound like typical fancy Asian-Western hybrid, some are actually quite a distinctive fusion of both... Two Sides of a Duck, for example, is my favourite pick. Smoked duck breast crostini and marinated duck gizzard (try if you are into that). Though I have better smoked duck breast, it is not fair to compare with the different league of more up-scale dinning experience elsewhere, if not the more down to earth price point right there. Tang Cu Pork Ribs, Bamboo Steamed Black Cod and Singing Crispy Rice may be familiar dishes in Chinese restaurants, but the idea to turn them into tapas servings and presentation is brilliant. Lorita, the proprietor & Sage, the chef emphasized on the craft of making the dishes from scratch, without MSG but yet able to bring the taste from the more creative ingredients for the seasoning. It is evident in the Curry Shrimp Hot Pot - strong, more bitterly flavour more like the Japanese style than Thai; and The Mini-Flip - beef slider using tender home-made patties with the smoky taste of teriyaki and kimchi on the side. Finishing the meal with the desserts like Red Bean Puff and Ice Cream, I could not believe I am full without breaking my wallet- not once but all my 3 visits with my friends and family. Right now Flip-A-Coin could only serve non-alcoholic beverages / mocktail but the selections are not just limited to boring soda or coffee at all. In fact, they have got the Chinese tea that could be fancy with the traditional Kung Fu tea ceremony! Imagine the potentials when it becomes a fully licensed establishment."}
{"text":"Food court flavours and appeal.  We arrived just before 7pm on a THursday night and were the only ones in the restaurant the ENTIRE time.  The waitress was inexperience and couldn't tell us the specials or ingredients or how the food was prepared - useless except for refilling our water glass.  This place was totally overstaffed with the one waitress, hostess/manager, and kitchen staff to wait for 1 table of 2 for the entire night.  I can't see how they will stay in business long.  The food tasted like food court lunch items.  I don't understand the high ratings here - must be posted by friends and family. My husband left hungry as we just didn't care enough for the food to order more than 4 dishes.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Highly recommend Mini Flip, Bowl of Joy, Tang Cu Pork Rib and Lo Mein. One Chef to go pls......"}
{"text":"Have gone there twice with my friend. Both of us love their foods and services. I love that tang cu pork rib most."}
{"text":"We went at 1:00 on a Saturday. No one was at the restaurant so we got super special attention lol.. the poutine is DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!! Loved it! Chilli chicken was great too! Nice ambience and great service. Hope they keep it up!"}
{"text":"Newly found chic restaurant in Mississauga downtown. Highly recommend mini flip, bow of joy, lo mein and singing crispy rice."}
{"text":"You see, it is quite rare for Chinese to own a bar like this in that area. I highly recommend this bar because of the aroma and taste of everything. The owners are very friendly, and they will offer suggestions based on YOU."}
{"text":"The signature burger, Mini Flip, is fabulous! Delicious, juicy and good looking, especially it is not expensive at all!  Besides, the Singing Crispy Rice will amuse you as a work of art when the waitress pours the source onto the Guoba. This course perfectly represents the name of Flip, fun and taste. Tang Cu Pork Rib and Chicken on Fire are popular Asian Course with chef's innovation."}
{"text":"Affordable excellent food. The chef is so creative on fusion courses. I really like the owner's handmade special drink, healthy and tasty. The mini burger set impresses me a lot. You will have $1 off if you can find out the secret ingredient in burger set. And this is good place for any ceremony or event."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. When you first show up you know that the menu is gonna be fun and funky. Was a little disappointed by the lack of a Liquor license but that is coming the owner told us. However the non-alcoholic drinks (we had the Hot Cranberry Apple Cider) are delightful and creative.  We didn't know where to start so we ended up ordering about half the menu. Tang Cu Pork Ribs were a perfect blend of spice and sweet. Cool Capellini is the best value by far (this will be great in the middle of the summer when it's hot outside). The Flip'n Healthy Wrap has a nice bit of hot (spice) and really was filling. Curry Shrimp Hot Pot had me wanting more but we already ordered way to much.   To finish everything off we had cappuccinos which were great (spoon said Nespresso but the quality was excellent either way) and my wife had the tea (which comes with a fun tea ceremony).   This great place tucked in downstairs on the wrong side of the bridge (most of the new restaurants are on the east side of the bridge) is well worth a visit. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place gets extra points for thinking outside the box, and providing some much needed variety in Mississauga.   The dishes are super creative, and thoughtfully put together.  I got to try nearly everything on the menu, and nothing really disappointed. One should be careful of the \"Chicken on fire\", it is really freaking spicy.   If you happen to be in Mississauga and feel like having an adventure this place is for you. It's worth at least one visit."}
{"text":"First time here, we gave the chief a green light. We took a chance on the Chief's Choice. It turns out that the burger and the Cool Capellini are magnificent, and the Nespresso as well. We'll try other stuff on the next visit."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited this place last week.  We ordered the cold capellini and the eggplant poutine.  I couldn't try the eggplant poutine but I heard it was pretty good.    In terms of the cold capellini, this is a completely vegan dish (95% sure of that) and tasted like a noodle salad with Rice Krispies on top.  The crunch of the rice combined with the soft/tangy noodles went well together.  I believe this was $6.  For $6, I was expecting one small bowl as tapas places are pretty expensive. However, I got 3 decent size bowls which IMO, would have been a good lunch.    As for the service, the servers were very friendly and willing to answer all questions I had. They also had some mocktails which is pretty cool, but I didn't order any.    Overall, very good."}
{"text":"Overall, I loved my experience here and I would come here again.   Service was slow (but I can tell they put a lot of effort into the food here and there's obviously a process to making the food so I'm willing to wait).   Atmosphere is nice, clean and cozy. I could carry on a conversation very nicely even with four other full tables.  The two girls working were so nice and asked how each dish was (I like how they sincerely wanted our opinion!).   The tea experience was so cool. Loved it! Just a suggestion: There should also be an option for people who want tea but just want the regular pot of tea and a bigger cup.   Loved the tapas concept but wish there were two or three options for people who like hearty dishes. We spent close to $100 and still had to go to another restaurant after because we were still hungry!   Dishes my table tried:   One Bite Tofu Delight-  The textures from the tofu, cracker and bacon together was oddly satisfying. The type of bacon they used wasn't too overbearing in saltiness or fat. The one with spicy mayo was my favourite  The Mini Flip- delicious sliders. Juicy, flavourful and the fresh spinach gave it a nice \"crisp\" feel. The Crisp Chips are so yummy (they're like the outside part of a spring roll).  Chicken On Fire- I love spicy food and this dish truly delivers. The chicken was juicy and not over cooked (thank god). However, there were so many chilli flakes in the dish that more than half the dish was just chilli! Wish there was less chilli and more chicken :)   Bamboo Steamed Black Cod- melts in your mouth and tastes SO good with the seaweed salad. Perfect portions!   Seaweed salad- tastier than most places I've been to. Fresh, crisp and flavourful. Not slimy and lacking in flavour like most places.  Berry smoothie- super tasty and thick (I love it that way) but it had a few ice chunks that got in the way.  I'm really upset I didn't try the Stat Anisse flavoured Creme Brûlée! I hope they have it next time I go :)"}
{"text":"Came back cuz they had an awesome dim sum promo for thanksgiving so I brought my fam. I think they're testing out 4 homemade dimsums: har gow, siu mai, spring rolls and custard bun. All done extremely well and I don't normally order those.   I'm happy to see that they renovated the place with more wood furnishing which give it a traditional Asian modern twist  Service is as good as always and helpful with menu explanations   Tip: they have really good daily specials that you should check out"}
{"text":"Loved the one bite tofu with avocado sauce, smoked duck, shrimp curry, spicy chicken. Didn't care for the lo mein. We were the only ones there when we came, Something I attribiute to the lack of a liquor license which they are getting best month (for me alcohol and tapas go hand in hand). Service was good. I loved the playlist. Place is somewhat hidden as it's below street level."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty but pricy considering I had a handful of small bites and no alcohol with Bill adding up to $68. I live 2 minute walk away so very convenient; If they had a liquor license we would come back."}
{"text":"FLIP a few dollars. It's worth it.  The first thing to know about FLIP A COIN is that its a \"tapas\" type restaurant. This means they serve their food in smaller portions meant for sharing. The benefit is that you get to taste several types of food at one sitting. And as tapas go, it can get expensive. Two people can expect to pay about $30 each to try 4 to 5 tapas. It's located just west of the Starbucks in Port Credit. There's parking on the street or behind FLIP.  They serve tea in a traditional tea set with a cast iron pot and a selection of teas. The Pork Ribs and the Mini FLIP were excellent. You'll want to have your own Mini FLIP :-) The Curry Shrimp Hot Pot was also excellent and perfect for sharing. The Thai curry has a nice kick to it. The Bamboo steamed Black Cod was tasty and I would vote for more cod on the dish.  The interior is interesting. The walls have some nice art and the music is perfect. The seating is a little \"cold\" except for the bench seats. But the space is only 3 weeks old. In time, this place will \"season\" nicely. The service is \"enthusiastic\". You can even win a prize if you can guess the secret ingredient in the Mini FLIP. It's not necessarily a spice and red cabbage or pork belly was wrong :-) Just a tip.  We went their early around 5:30 on a Monday night and it was empty. I think they will start seeing more people as soon as it gets discovered in Port Credit. The nice part about an empty restaurant is the feeling you are the only ones being catered to. That won't last long at Flip a Coin. If the menu keeps changing they will keep bringing people back.   Well done FLIP"}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience and interestingly enough it is the closest proper restaurant to our house, and yet we took some time to try it out.  Flip a Coin will be a regular for us now.  The Tang Cu Pork Ribs (sweet and sticky) and Lo Mein (spicy and savoury) were amazing, as was the Asian Poutine (for me it tasted a lot better than I expected based on the menu description).  Everything else we tried was good but these three really stood out.  Service was exceptionally friendly and we received good recommendations.  I only hope this place gets enough business because it is a little out of the way as businesses in Port Credit go and it would be a shame if they didn't stick around."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of visiting in their first week.  Service was excellent; food was very tasty and great value.  We enjoyed the crispy rice, black cod, sliders, lo mein, spare ribs and duck. I recommend all of these dishes.  Will definitely come back.  Hope the liquor license is in place soon."}
{"text":"I went to this place after seeing multiple great reviews and seeing it was new I was super excited.  Pluses:  on the plus side the service, ambiance was great,  our waitress was super nice and kept bringing us drinks and such.  The 2 stars are mainly for the waitress   Negatives:  the food was very disappointing. Honestly over priced and terrible.  We tried the salmon tacos, poutine, ribs, clams/crab, some spicy chicken dish.  Honestly everything was over salted, needlessly spicy.  I understand that tapas are small dishes but at least make them good.. The clams/crab dish was 13$ I think and u got a large mound of imitation crab... If ur gonna put imitation crab specify it on the menu so I know not to order it.   Final note:  I wouldn't recommend this place.  The place was dead and I can see why."}
{"text":"Arrived for lunch at 12:30pm on a Friday, restaurant is very clean, food is excellent and came to the table very quickly.  Background music is very good volume and playlist was pleasant.  To reach 5 stars they need to place good quality chopsticks on the tables (we were given cheap wooden ones that broke) instead of or beside the forks. Also, remove the Christmas tree and decorations. (It's the 15th of January)"}
{"text":"Walked in, it was sorta busy... Busy enough that they didn't have menus for us. Ordered the mini burgers, low mein and the curry. Burgers lacked flavour and was messy to eat. Low mein had a weird taste to it, almost like a burnt taste, couldn't finish it. The curry was the best out of all three meals. For drinks I ordered the milk tea with tapioca; the tapioca was super bland, no sweetness to it. I also ordered this because outside there was a promotion banner, 10% off your bill when you order a drink. However, when the bill came we didn't get the 10% off, told the waitress about the promotion they were advertising outside, she told me it was over. Eventually they honoured the 10% off the bill...... One thing that bothered me was the kitchen staff, all the girls in there had no hair nets on, and many had their long hair out and they were going in and out of the kitchen. I saw some guys wearing hats though.   Food: 2/5 Service: 3.5/5 Atmosphere: 2.5/5"}
{"text":"Atmosphere Nicely decorated.   Price Okay. Average 10 bux per tapas. Cheap for tapas but way expensive for asian food.  Service Friendly servers. Odd how they serve the tapas. Took awhile for food to arrive once ordered but then all came out at once. Usually tapas you get one or two dishes at a time to enjoy then more comes otherwise they will all get cold and the tables are too small for all the dishes.   Food Not memorable. Well memorable in a negative way. The pork ribs were way too sweet but was the best dish. Crispy rice no taste. So bland.  The chicken, easy on the chili please. Chicken on fire I know. But all you taste is the chili. Wasnt cooked well. I like spicy food but this is cooked oddly. Poutine is odd with sweet potato instead of regular fries. Sweet potato fries get soggy too quickly so doesnt go in a poutine unlike regular fries.  The duck was good if you can bite through the crazy hard croutons. Also not sure how it goes with sweet and sour side dish.   For the 60 bux, I could get a way better flavorful asian meal elsewhere in the GTA. Only twist here is it is tapas style rather than big dish family style. This twist is not worth it for the odd food.   By the way stop reviewing your own restaurant. Only out a month and a small restaurant there would not be that many reviews up by now. How funny that most have only 1 review under their belt."}
