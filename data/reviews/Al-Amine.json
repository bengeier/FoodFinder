{"text":"The price is relatively low, but the taste is just so so. I think the pizza is a bit salty, the shrimp pancake is not salty but a bit too soft to me."}
{"text":"Had the shish taouk.  It was not very big, did not have a lot of the pickled veggies and the sauce tasted more like mayonnaise than yogurt.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Some of the staff who serve aren't attentive and you have to repeat yourself several times to remind them of what you asked - language in either French or English isn't their forte. I don't recommend the pita shawarmas or pita taouks- they don't have much flavour and the vegetable ingredients weren't very fresh looking either. Their full-plate menus are generous but too cooked and mushy in consistency. I really don't recommend their pizza either it's very plain and low quality. Which leaves only their baked goods to try (pita zaatar, lahmajouns... etc.) and they're ok."}
{"text":"Expensive for what it is. Still good once in a while, you can find better places to eat around."}
{"text":"This place is used to be a bakery but now offers a variety of food and Eastern pastries. The food is reasonable and tasty. Sometimes you can taste over use of oil. There are vegan and vegetarian options (essentially felafel with a mixture of vegetables and legumes). The price is affordable and set in a level for students."}
{"text":"If you want cheap and filling food then this is the place for you. I usually go for the shish taouk plater as all the components are well cooked and seasoned. I would definitely recommend this place to any student nearby."}
{"text":"Well, it ain't as great as it used to be.  Since my schedule makes it so that I mostly go here about half an hour before closing, it basically ensures that they've saved the worst for last.  It's best to go much earlier in the day while ingredients are still fresh.  But man, I've gotten some serious dirt sandwiches when ordering falafel here 15 minutes before closing.  My friends are often treated to the last morose, burnt slices of pizza at night.  Also my favourite item - zaatars - are rarely available at night for some reason, which makes me a sad vegan.  I'll still ask the staff, \"Kaifa haluka?\" when they serve me but these days - depending on if it is even daytime, anyway - I'm almost scared of the answer.  You will still fart all day if you eat anything from here.  That is still, of course, almost universally true of Lebanese food."}
{"text":"Pratique, près de l'Université de Montéal et pas cher, Al-Amine est un restaurant libanais proposant plusieurs spécialités orientales, mais aussi des pizzas défiant toute concurrence.  Quand on a pas d'argent, qu'on est encore à l'université tard le soir et qu'on veut se faire plaisir de temps en temps, pas de soucis. Vous pouvez y allez en allant déguster une pointe de pizza à 2$ seulement (reine, végétarienne, 4 fromages et j'en passe). Et la qualité est toujours au rendez-vous. Car Al-Amine est scindé en deux : - Vous avez une partie \"restauration rapide\" avec des pizzas - Vous avez une deuxième partie consacrée aux spécialités : falafels, Kafta poulet, shish taouk, etc. Bien entendu, vous avez le choix entre prendre soit le plat, soit le sandwich (qui est moins cher).  Bon après, la décoration n'est pas vraiment l'atout majeur du restaurant, mais je vous garantis qu'avec un service correct et des plats bien garnis, votre porte-monnaie pourra vous dire merci!  Et cerise sur le gâteau, il fait même la livraison à domicile (en commandant soit en ligne ou soit par téléphone)."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and affordable. It's basically a halal bakery that sells manakish and sandwiches, as well as Amir-like food and trios.  Been here a couple of times including yesterday and got 12 deliciously fresh mini pizzas (great idea for a potluck) and 2 fully loaded spicy beef kafta manakish (with olives, garlic sauce, etc) all for $13.55.   You won't get that from Altaib or Aroush! If you're near the Snowdon/Universite de MTL area, it's a must-try!!"}
{"text":"Well, I've been here twice now, and I can say a couple things. 1. Their food is cheap, doughy and plentiful. 2. Their hummus is quite weird, but not bad. 3. If you speak English, some of the staff members will demand you speak in French. Not ask, mind you - demand. I actually got so flustered by one particularly cranky guy that I started trying to speak Spanish instead. And I don't even speak Spanish. Summary: I don't think I'd go out of my way to visit this place. If I just happened to be walking by and I was hungry maybe I'd grab something. Otherwise, no."}
{"text":"Ordered their mexican pizza with my family. Was made fresh, tasty and fresh ingredients and friendly staff. They also sell many other middle eastern treats that I'll need to try out next time. A÷÷÷÷ Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"The entire middle east under one roof ! Al-Amine is a big fast food type restaurant that is located in the heart of the cote des neiges area.. You can find charcoal grillades, shish taouk/shawarma, pizza, mini pizza, breads, desserts and sweets. The staff is friendly and nice, they are open till late at nights, their grillades are tasty and meat is so juicy n tender ! We ordered one sandwich to share and after a bite we decided to order a second one because of its amazing taste .. Will definately visit again when in the area"}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised at the current 3 star rating, as I was quite impressed with a few things specifically. In fact I'm eating the rest of my incredible date puree filled galette (danish) now. Even several days past when I bought the super soft, plump and fresh bag of 5 for $3.50. I just knew by looking - these sesame seeded stuffed star shaped sweet rolls would be a treat. I ate one whole after my chicken Shish Taouk pita on the way home. I could not resist it.  OK, as for my other pre-dinner snack. Let's just say that the spinning thick chicken breasts, caught my eye on the spit. The chicken pita (4.35) was one of the best I'd ever had, fresh chopped lettuce, seasoned onions, an excellent uniquely potent garlic mayo, I tasted a hint of lemon flavour that merged perfectly with the marinated chicken. Good quality, great tasting.   One other notable, was the friendly gentleman behind the counter was stirring and shaping the stunningly fresh looking rice while chatting with a regular patron, who'd been coming for many years. Both good signs. Not to get overly excited about the rice trays, but the were full and inviting, even in the late afternoon, when you might expect them to be bare, dry and/or just overtired.   The more I recall and write, I am tempted to give a 5, but I'll refrain until I try one more time to confirm that my findings weren't just a mirage of eating pleasure...and admit to myself that there are other top notch pita sandwiches other than...well you know the one on Crescent St."}
{"text":"I am a UdeM student and this is just a right place.  They give good quantity and quality foods with a reasonable price. Specially when you are at your midterm or final and you don't have time to cook nor bring your foods. You call for a delivery for a Mixed Plat under 15$. And you will feel happy.  Recommended to try this place at least once if you study near by."}
{"text":"Un service parfois très rapide (aussi rapide qu'un Mc Donald) parfois vous pouvez patienter assez longtemps ddépendemment de ce que vous commandez. La qualité acceptable mais variable (je parle du poulet). Pour les plats complets j'ai trouvé les légumes beaucoup trop salés. Par contre vous avez de la quantité."}
