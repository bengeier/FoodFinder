{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night at around 7:30pm. It was pretty full. Only a couple tables available (one was for a large group, one 2-person table). There are a few counter seats for single diners.   1. Ma Po Tofu - $6.95 Very spicy. No ground beef like most places. Lots of chilli oil. Good but wish it had meat in it.   2. Pork intestine, hand pulled noodle  A small bowl had quite a lot of noodles. Not mushy noodles, firm texture. Pork intestine was a nice balance. Broth was flavorful but not too salty."}
{"text":"My family and I had a wonderful lunch here.   The noodles were excellent and the taste is amazing.  Every dish we ordered we loved definitely will come back very soon.    The prices are reasonable and even much lower than most food court prices, and the overall decor and atmosphere is pleasant.   I would have given a 5 stars if they could have improve on their server attitude.   Beside their lack of customer service otherwise this is a great little restaurant to visit from time to time if you like hot  spicy food."}
{"text":"Clean, good service, but very difficult to find item that is not spicy hot.  Had: Small dumplings in Chicken broth for $2.75.  This is fine. Small spicy pork noodles for $2.75.  In spite of the attendant's assurance that this was mildly spiced, it was strong. Had Mushroom gourd plate for $8.95.  Reasonalbly good, but small and greasy.  This is a restaurant only for those who like very red chili hot items.  It is not the same as a hot item created with a variety of herbs.  There are a very few cold dishes, but it is hard to choose.  Because of this lack of choice of non-hot items, I won't return."}
{"text":"Came here few weeks ago and ordered noodle with pork intestine pieces. Verdict: bland!! Will not come back at all. $10 tax and tip included not worth it. Take your money somewhere"}
{"text":"Came here twice because it's close to my house.  Tried Lan Zou hand pulled noodle and pork intestine noodles here.  The hand pulled noodle is yummy but the broth is just ok, not memorable.  They serve some tasty appetizers to go with the noodle such as sliced pork in chilli oil and garlic as well as sliced broil pork with mashed garlic.  I personally like the broil pork with mashed garlic.  The chilly oil isn't too overwhelmingly spicy and it's quite balanced.  But I did find the texture of the sliced pork a bit firm.  The portion here is quite filling, especially for the noodles.  Would have been nicer with more vegetable and meat.  Maybe next time I will try house special spare rib noodles.  The price is fair, service wise is efficient like every other Chinese joints.  This place has been opened not long ago so it's overall clean."}
{"text":"Not bad! Pretty decent looking place compared to other mom and pop shops and also its located in a ghetto plaza with most other units closed down, but hey, probably really cheap rent!!! Serves Northern Chinese. Had the spicy beef noodles w/ spicy peppers. Menu has a good selection of spicy food if you are in to that! Service was prompt and lots of customers coming in for lunch. From the quick glance I had of the menu, most dishes are under $10."}
{"text":"Ordered a shrimp egg noodles, too salty, oily and spicy.  The food at this restaurant has deteriorated so much I will not return.  Service is passable."}
{"text":"Not bad! But you have to like Chinese food the way they make it in China. Which means, lots of sodium, oil, garlic and chili peppers. How else do you get that strong flavour?! Flavour at par with other \"china\" restaurants,  but at a fraction of the price.  See attached pictures."}
{"text":"I am absolutely disgusted at this place!  I was here with my family on a Saturday evening. We  were told to sit at a table that had grease and towel marks all over it. There were left over noodles on the table and the waitress did not bother to clean it. The tea cups and bowls had minor chips on the rims. Not to mention the bathroom floor was sticky. We made our order and the food came pretty quickly. The hand pulled noodles were yummy but there were too much salt and msg in the broth!!! We also ordered spicy Sichuan sausages and egg plants in addition to the house special noodles. I was really thirsty after my meal, maybe it was from the msg?  I would not go back again mainly because of how dirty and disgusting the environment was. This place is in need for a major deep scrub and clean up!"}
{"text":"I went to this place for a quick lunch on a tuesday afternoon. with a party of 2. The decor at the place is simple, definitely not a date restaurant and one thing that is noted is that this place is clearly for a quick casual dinner or lunch.   This is not my first time here, as i've been here multiple times before. This noodle oriented restaurant, we tried two kinds this time, which was the cold noodle and a fried noodle.   The cold noodle was not exceptional but serviceable. it taste much like any pre-made pre package sauce you can buy at grocery store.   the other noodles however, the tomato beef noodle was much better, although they used to do a better job with the noodle had a more tangy sour flavour with more tomato, where as now it is more salty and taste more like regular noodles that have soy sauce. Overall for a quick lunch that is not too expensive this is good local place to be in. but don't expect to be wowed. though it does have decent portions and taste is okay.  the Service in this place is expected as a typical chinese service restaurant, which is not amazing service but they will be efficient and not have a lot of fuss"}
{"text":"Came with my parents tonight because my mom noticed this place was around. She thought it was new. Turns out it wasn't. Oh well. We were at Magic Noodle about a month and a half ago, and we wanted to do some kind of comparison.  Had:  Hand pulled noodles with spare rib ($6.99). For the price, it was alright. The ribs could have been more tender, the noodles could have had more chew (although I did like that they were thinner than most other hand pulled noodles I've seen), and the broth could have been more flavorful.  Clear noodle with chili sauce ($3.99 size small) - Not chili sauce. Chili oil. Swimming in it. But that is what it's supposed to be. I love this kind of chili oil. It's an okay portion for the price, but I've had cheaper and better elsewhere. The noodles also needed a tad more of a bite to them.  Mixed celery with peanuts ($3.99 size small) - Not bad, but once again, the portion to price is a tad off, especially for a dish made of celery, carrots, and peanuts. The peanuts could have been slightly crunchier.  Steamed chicken in spicy garlic sauce ($4.99 size small) - This looks nothing like the picture. I'm actually surprised. Usually, this dish looks almost exactly like the picture of it on the menu, because it's not that hard to recreate that picture. It's usually chicken that's been chopped up, but placed back together to resemble the part of the chicken it came from. This was pieces of chicken haphazardly stacked up. They pieces were also larger than I expected. It seems like they used all drumstick pieces, instead of the typical drumstick and thigh. Taste-wise, it was alright, but I've had better. Portion to price was decent. This one's also drowning in chili oil, for those of you wondering what spicy garlic sauce looks like. It was not particularly heavy on the garlic either.  Sauteed shredded pork with sweet bean sauce ($10.99) - The picture of this on the menu makes this look like it's serve with Chinese style crepes. We asked the waitress if this was the case, that it was served with wraps, and she said yes. She didn't know how many, but she said it was enough for the portion of meat. Upon receiving our dish, we discovered they weren't crepes at all. They were sheets of dry tofu (not to be confused with bean curd sheets). It was an interesting concept. However, they only provided about eight sheets, and each sheet could not hold much meat. We ended up having 2/3 of our meat left. There were definitely not enough wraps for it. The shredded pork is served in a sauce that tastes like hoisin. It's tasty, but it's strong. There was a smattering of shredded green onion on the meat, but I would have liked a whole lot more of it to neutralize some of that sweet sauce. That being said, out of all the dishes I had tonight, this is the one I'd be most likely to order again.  If you're in the area and craving this kind of food, then sure. Go for it. However, I wouldn't make a special trip to come again."}
{"text":"Had the beef hand pulled noodles.  ~$10  Decent portion size but not fantastc.  Not much meat, but the meat that was there was tender but blend.    The noodles are better than normal, but not as great as hand pulled noodles should be.  Lacking in chewiness."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best - but the service needs improvement STAT!   First of all, You're given a paper to order off of and a bound menu with pictures and english for most dishes. However, the paper only has Chinese, but no English, the dishes are numbered on the paper - but there's NO corresponding number in the bound menu. This makes it difficult for people to order off of if they can't read Chinese.   Food - assortment of dishes - hand pulled soup or stir-fried noodles offered. Most come in small or large sizes ranging from 7-8 dollars. They also offer a lot of spicy cold appetizer dishes - small or large those range from 4-5 dollars. Also - spicy fish soup.   Ordered the cold soy fish - terrible. Super salty, scales and bones and not a lot of meat at all. Had to leave more than half the plate because it was almost inedible.  Ordered a small bowl of Sparerib soup noodle. The spareribs were good. Nice and tender, and flavourful - there were about 5 pieces of sizable pieces in there, and maybe 2 pieces of bak choy and plenty of cilantro and green onions. noodles were ok - I've had better hand pulled noodles elsewhere, these were a bit overdone.  Ordered a plate of their house stir fried noodle dish. We marked it off the white menu, so there was no description of matching picture in the bound menu. So we asked one of the servers what the house noodles had in it. Without saying a word, she points at a card on a table beside ours and begins to walk away. We ask again before she got too far and she takes a step back and barks some of the ingredients to us. The dish is made up of thick hand pulled noodles (good texture), thinly sliced pork, thinly sliced peppers, some hot and some sweet, onions, eggs, cabbage, and some sort of tangy, almost soy vinegar sauce. Very salty dish - and the vinegar is very strong. the best bites come when you get the sweet cabbage because it helps with the vinegar taste.    We had to ask for sharing bowls at least twice before they brought some over, and gave us attitude and refused to cut our noodles when we asked for them to be cut because they were too long and bunched together and hard to share.   Some of the seating is poorly arranged, the servers were reaching over our table to service the table beside us instead of walking around while we were eating. ie: passing the cheque, or bringing food to the table beside ours. Pure laziness.   Teapot went empty, and we put the lid ontop of the teapot to indicate, we asked multiple times to refill and it never happened until we signaled to get the bill.   So their food isn't the worst, but overall way too salty. But the service left the worst taste in my mouth. Never again."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite for lunch with my Mom. I didn't even know this noodle joint existed until I \"Yelped\". It's apparently been here awhile.   I ordered the Chongqing noodles which were SUPER spicy but it was decent although I prefer Hey Noodles. But with a bowl of noodles at $5.99 I cannot complain. There was a lot of noodles but little vegetables. You can opt to order side dishes to compliment the dish but I just wanted to try out the noodles first.   Service was a typical Chinese restaurant and they offer a sheet to order your food. So in short, there was very little service. Oh there's takeout available as well. Most the dishes on the menu are spicy as it is a Northern Chinese Restaurant but there are a couple of dishes for those who cannot handle spice."}
{"text":"I came to Eight Noodles of course to eat some noodles!!   Freshly hand pulled noodle always been my favourite so I am excited to give this place a try! Even though it is a Northern Chinese Restaurant, there are still quite a few items that are not spicy or cover with chili oil!  We shared:  Lan Zhou La Mian ($7.95) Large and Pig Intestine Noodle Soup ($6.75) Small - Both noodles were cooked al dente with a great bite!  - One of my friend prefers that more subtle Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Broth, savory with a lingering beef after taste - My other friend prefers the pig intestine soup because of the more salty soy based taste  Wonton in Chili Oil ($2.75) Small and Cold Chicken in Chili Oil ($3.75) Small - Though both of them were soaked in chili oil but both has a different kind of spiciness to it! - Wonton is less spicy than the cold chicken and I enjoyed both of them!  I definitely will be back to Eight Noodles again! The option of small or large portion for noodles and appetizers is great so even if you are not in a group you can try out more different dishes!  Eight Noodles' Chinese Name means Face to Face with Noodle... I will be back for a face off soon!  FYI, there is a colourful photo menu with English and Chinese description for almost every single dish..."}
{"text":"Eight Noodles is a noodle cafeteria.  I ordered a Lan Zhou La Mian for lunch.  It was quite good, in that the noodle was al dente, the beef was too thin to be tasty, but the broth tasted bold.    The best part is that the store is next to a McDonald.  My mobile phone somehow could catch the free WIFI signal of McD, so I could surf the internet while waiting for my order.  In all, it is an okay spot for a quick noodle meal.  In and out, patrons come in fast, get full and get out."}
{"text":"Its actually 1.6....   I'm really struggling with this place.... I ordered their speciality it was OK... The meat was OK but thin..  The soup was decent.... Until the water went to the supermarket next door with his shopping cart t.t right across the restaurant and then back with veggie and supplies.... I really lost my appetite right there. I don't really want to know that my food came from the supermarket that keeps meat in stores well after the expiry date .. . *sigh* one of the female waitresses was a bit bitchy, delivered my food and just dropped it on the table making a very loud noise and left without saying a word... Moreover!!! Their rice is from the front they only have one rice cooker... All their rice is stored in the front near the counter... Not a dry cellar.... And cooked rice used in kitchen is from the same pot... Been there all day.... (Did not want to know yuck!) And moreover, waiters and waitresses have nothing to do but all gather and talk gossip loudly while customers eat... My water has been empty for 10mins they don't come refill it t.t   Poor management and service , mediocre supermarket food at best(foodymart does better meals), hand pulled noodles... I taste the doughiness but I don't taste the texture that come with real hand pulled noodles (dough made in store and then put through a noodle making machine is more accurate)   Would not come back cuz knowing they probably buy expired meat makes me sick. They also have their menu to order dully in Chinese. They treat all Asian like they know how to read and treat white people way better (take their order and ask if they want water or tea and introduce their menu), I got none of that shit just \"did you order yet, are u ready yet\" dammit let me think t.t   Only came cuz its close by my new place and I didn't want Italian or mcdonalds... Seriously regretting not eating mcd's now..."}
