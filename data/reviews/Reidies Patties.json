{"text":"This place is terrible, i have never physically had one from here but im at this store every day of the week to get a patty but its never open.  It has been open once in the summer on a sunday. Witch the hours indicate CLOSED on sundays.  Im starting to think this is either a drug location or a prostitution spot. Like wtf why isnt it ever mhmm..... thinga that make ypu wonder eh."}
{"text":"It's a shame this place is so badly managed because the patties are nice and there aren't any other places selling patties around this area, as far as I know.  Don't let the operating hours they advertise fool you, they are almost never open at the correct hour and some days not at all. They advertised a grand opening special and first opened their doors over two weeks later.  I've never tasted the veggie patty because they've never had one in stock the few times I went there and they were actually open. The beef patty is tasty, and the chicken patty is a nice curry flavour."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place today but it was closed even though their hours would indicate that they should be open today....odd."}
