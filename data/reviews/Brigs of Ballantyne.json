{"text":"Always on the lookout for a breakfast place. Had breakfast here today I ordered from the lite portion menu, one gingerbread pancake, one egg scrabble and 1 turkey sausage.  I enjoyed it very much the gingerbread pancake was flavorful with whip on it too.and maple syrup, So much for my diet I am on.   

Hubby had the traditional pancakes with home fries that had a little kick(spicy) taste. He liked his.  

Have to try the award winning Benedict's next time.."}
{"text":"We went for brunch after church. We waited for seating for five while groups of four were being seated that came in long after we arrived. I was looking forward to the monthly special of blackberry pancakes, but they had already run out. I don't plan to return anytime soon. Also, the fried egg ordered over medium were over cooked"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Food is ok. Nothing amazing, but decent. My biggest issue with this place is the old man manager. For some reason each time I've been here he has been a total dick. I don't get it. 

The first time I was there he tried to to seat my family up against a group of large individuals. There was absolutely no way we could comfortably sit there, and since there was about 20 other open tables, I asked the manager if we could sit at a different table instead. He didn't like that request at all and threw attitude about it.  It was one of the moments where I just looked at my wife with an \"is this guy serious?\" Look on my face. 

Today I came in with some out of town guests, and when I said I was a party of 7 he rolled his eyes.. Wtf? This might be my last visit. I don't care how good the food is, a place is only as good as the service."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here. Lots of food for the price. I had salmon and my wife had the gyro. Both were good. The broccoli salad side is tasty. We'll  be back. We liked Eddies that use to be at this location too. This is a good replacement."}
{"text":"\"Shrimp and grits were OK, but certainly weren't \"low country\" style. Grits were runny and needed salt. Shrimp were tiny and seemed \"canned \" I would definitely come here again but would not order this dish.\""}
{"text":"After reading some reviews and seeing all the \"best of\" awards for their Cary Raleigh and Wake Forest locations, I was excited to check it out.  (I also saw it looked pretty busy while dining at Zeitouni the other day.) 

Unfortunately, the food didn't match the hype. 

I got one of their \"famous\" benedicts, one with blue crab and asparagus.  It came out with crab and shrimp.  Ok, I'll let it slide, the server told us she was new. The problem was the egg and the hollandaise.  The egg was poached too long and the yolk not runny.  The sauce was too thick and congealed with a dried-out film over the top. 

This dish came with fruit, and as indicated by Julia M. the fruit consisted of super skinny slice of orange, pineapple, and the kicker...mine had rotten grapes!  Three were indented and brown and shriveled. How could this have left the kitchen? 

The home fries were flavorful, which is great...but mushy.  They could have been mashed potatoes, in disguise.  Wish there was a crisp on the outside. 

My husband's pumpkin pancake on special was pretty good...but we've had better. His eggs and bacon and english muffin were fine, and what you'd expect from a casual dining restaurant. 

Bottom line, I feel like I wasted my weekend morning calories here..though gave them 3 stars for being friendly and prompt, and benefit of the doubt they're just going through opening pains."}
{"text":"Everything here is good. Watch for seasonal variations on classic dishes depending on the time of the year."}
{"text":"Breakfast was great. My wife and I split the Egg Benedict plate with a side order of bacon. It came with potatoes and fruit. For $11, it was a good option. Everything was cooked right and the hollindaise sauce was clearly from scratch."}
{"text":"Don't bother.  Unfriendly managers.  Lousy food."}
{"text":"Saturday Brunch with my 2Favs is a weekly To Do (for the most part) & being still new to Charlotte we try to experience different restaurants until we find that SPECIAL place to make our weekly location.

Today I logged into Yelp to see what was near by fit brunch & Briggs as well as Cast Iron Waffle appeared. We started at Cast Iron Waffle & once we found that they only served waffles & coffees with no sides (egg whites, turkey sausage, etc..) we quickly exited & headed to Briggs.

The reviews were mixed but every restaurant deserves a try if the reviews aren't horrific. So a try is what we gave BRIGGS & our review is below.
 
I had the Shrimp & Grits minus bacon & a side of egg whites:
There was EXTREMELY TOO much cheese on this concoction plus the shrimp was those cheap nasty baby shrimp that I am not a fan of. The pita pints grilled on the side of the shrimp & grits were the highlight of the meal. The egg whites were greasy..

The Mr. had a egg white Garden Omelette with a side of turkey sausage & honey wheat English Muffin:
The omelette was average as well as the rest of the items. It was all edible & something he'd order again if we were to visit the restaurant again in the future.

My mini ME had the Chicken & Waffles: As a chicken & waffle connoisseur the waffles were soft & the chicken tenders were fatty & extremely HARD & not tasty at all. Besides that the side of eggs scrambled with cheese were extremely runny & cheesy it seemed like a pile of wet fried cheese..

Maybe we didn't get the right items but I can't promise that we will revisit this place again because we've found much better places to have brunch at in Charlotte thus far, HOWEVER if we do I will be sure to update my review if the food we try is any better.

Service:
The entire staff was pleasant & attentive, even the chef came out to speak & personally serve our table & a couple of the tables near us."}
{"text":"A friend and I ate breakfast there this past weekend and we both really liked it. We arrived around 10:00 AM on Sunday and there was no wait at all - we got seated right away; though, within 30 minutes or so there was a queue. Lots of people waiting for a table an hour later as we left. 

I ordered a Belgian waffle, a side of bacon and coffee. Coffee was okay, normal restaurant coffee. Belgian waffle was delicious, light and airy, great taste and still hot (which is always an issue when eating out, as they seem to cool down really fast). The bacon was too crispy for my taste and I would've much preferred thick-cut, but it was okay.

My friend ordered the french toast, also with a side of bacon. She orders french toast almost everytime we meet for breakfast! Let me say, it was a large plate of food, I think 5 slices of french toast and she ate almost every bite (and she's a little thing!) - she said it was fantastic.

Our server was really nice and cheerful and the interior was clean and neat; though small. Lots to choose from on the menu and I'll try something new next time -- I'll definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"Brigs is pretty good for the price.  The service is decent enough and the food comes HOT and FAST.  They are a small chain from the RDU area and seem to have more of a following in the Triangle.

This reminds me of a locally owned Denny's style brunch place."}
{"text":"Brigs is a hidden treasure in my opinion.

They have really yummy food for really great prices. During the week they have Weekday Breakfast Specials for $5.99 with several different options like omelets, breakfast sandwiches, eggs, bacon and pancakes...the list goes on and on! And the portion sizes here are enormous!  They also have a great variety of brunch options like salads, sandwiches, and even some southern favorites like chicken and waffles! 

But this review is totally dedicated to my new favorite dish here: Shrimp and Grits!

 Now normally I am not a fan of grits, but this dish is slowly making me a grits lover. This dish has delicious creamy grits with a blend of cheeses and sauteed shrimp, bacon, bell peppers and caramelized onions. Then they are served with grilled pita points as a side. 

The grits are creamy and delicious, the bell peppers add a very welcome spicy kick to the meal and with the sauteed shrimp and bacon make it complete, each bite is better than the last and the pita pits are a delicious compliment to the dish. 

Overall, this dish was heavenly, I can not wait to go and enjoy it again!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a group of coworkers (10 of us total). It is right by our office, within walking distance so most of us were familiar with the location and menu offerings. After we were the waiter took our drink order, he was a little slow because he was our only waiter with no help. 

I've been to the Brigs in Raleigh so I knew what I liked there and thought it would translate here, because it is a chain. I ordered the Count skillet expecting all of the ingredients, eggs, mushrooms, ham, bacon, onions, tomatoes to be baked together. When it came out I had 2 eggs over easy on top of all of the other ingredients. I was slightly disappointed, but I guess I should have looked at the menu more closely because that's what it said they do. The ham was also cubed here vs. sliced which between the two was the reason I didn't enjoy the skillet as much. 

The service was good, albeit slow, due to our group size. I would visit again, but maybe this time adjust my order for the location."}
{"text":"We've heard great things about Brigs, so we decided to check them out on a weekday to avoid the massive weekend crowd.  Their weekday breakfast specials are $5.99, so it was a great decision, and I have to say, best blueberry pancakes I've ever had.  They don't skimp on the size or blueberries and the pancakes are so light and fluffy.  My bacon was extra crispy (as requested) without being burnt, and the grits were creamy.  My husband had the croissant sandwich with eggs, cheese and bacon and said it was awesome.  Service was great and the food was fantastic.  We'll definitely be back to sample more of their huge breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Finally made it over to Brigs for a sit-down meal instead of just take-out.  We got there right around noon and did not have a wait. This visit exceeded expectations due to the great service we got and the fact that the food was really good today.  

David ordered the Alaskan Omelette which has blue crab, shrimp, cream cheese and is topped with Holldandise sauce. For his sides, he went with fruit and a honey wheat English muffin. The fruit side consisted of a little dish of grapes, a slice of orange, a slice of pineapple and a slice of melon. The omelette was huge and he said the flavor was very good.

I went with the seafood scramble which also has blue crab, shrimp and cream cheese.  I had home fries and a honey whole wheat English muffin.  The seafood scramble was terrific - great flavor and very creamy. The potatoes were ok - not the best I've had, but certainly not the worst either.  I would definitely order this dish again."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place to eat in Ballantyne, but it is A-OK.  The breakfast potatoes are not very good, but the eggs were great and the pancakes looked delicious!"}
{"text":"I went here for a late lunch in January. The menu has more breakfast items then lunch items. Inside, its quite nice with a upscale feel for such a local place. The lunch menu could use more items. I got a burger (An american cheeseburger isnt listed on the menu, but they can easily make it for you). Fries were good. Burger tasted great. If they can add a few more lunch options, this could be a great place. Ill def try breakfast next time. Service was fast and prompt. Try it!"}
{"text":"I was originally going to the original pancake house but I came to try this place out Briggs in spite of some of the negative reviews to see what I thought of it so the country scramble. My dish was ok, tasted like Denny's food.. So I was not that impressed..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast while staying at hotel across the street. The staff was pleasant and attentive. I ordered a short stack of pancakes. They were big, but as for taste it was eh. I ate em, but I've had better. Next time I want pancakes I'll find an IHOP."}
{"text":"Up to four stars.  I just am amazed at how complete their breakfast menu truly is.  And they have specials, to boot!

Yes, lunch is doable and just as good.  Really like to go with wife on one of those cold mornings where we are early enough to be one of only three or four other occupied tables.  Like a home kitchen, chatting with the wait staff and enjoying the hot coffee as we dither on what to order this time.  

Does get crowded, esp on weekends, so go early in any case and avoid the prime times for lunch.

Nice people there and good chow."}
{"text":"The 3 stars currently displayed as an overall average from Yelpers is accurate.  It's not bad at all, but it is also not outstanding either.  It almost makes me think that there aren't too many good breakfast joints in the RDU area for Brigs to take top honors.  It is definitely better than an IHOP, Denny's, or Awful House.  However, it is not as good as good as Original Pancake House or Flying Biscuit.

I had an omelette which was fairly standard, but the cheddar cheese was more on top of it rather than cooked in it.  The eggs were also decent - cooked well and not runny.  My wife got scrambled eggs which were about the same as well as a large pumpkin pancake,  That was also decent.  We each got sides of fruit with our orders, and it was actually very fresh,  It was few grapes, a honeydew, a slice of a pineapple, and a slice of an orange.

It wasn't too busy when we first arrived around 6pm on a Friday.  A few other tables came in as we were eating, but it was far from busy.  Our service was prompt and nice.  The chef even came out and asked how everything was which was a nice touch.  You don't usually see that in \"cheaper\" restaurants.

Would I go back to Brigs?  Yes, but it also may not be my first choice for breakfast food.  I say go, but don't expect to be wowed."}
{"text":"We made it to Brigs for a breakfast.  And I must say, I was a little bit dissapointed... So you might ask, Why 4 stars? Well I rounded up because of their service they provided.
 The food was good, but nothing that I believe I will ever crave.  
The presentation of the dishes was very nice however.  
The service was pretty good, we had a large group (19 if I am correct) and they filled the orders extremely quick and brought out all of the orders in a timely manner and at the same time, which is quite difficult to do. 
The menu seemed large.  But, upon further inspection, it was just drawn out to make it look larger than it truly was. 
The prices were reasonable, and I believe that I would choose Brigs over IHOP for the sheer fact that they most likely won't be as busy as IHOP."}
{"text":"Our waitress told us the grits at Flying Biscuit were better than the grits here, and frankly, that's how I felt about the whole scene. My omelette had plenty of fresh veggies in it, my toast was nicely buttered, my coffee was hot. But it's no Flying Biscuit.

My chief complaint: the potatoes. They were soggy and mushy, which, ew. I love potatoes, and I really have a tough time forgiving people who eff them up."}
{"text":"Brigs is your family go to for breakfast! open early and closes early since they only serve breakfast and lunch/brunch!

For a breakfast restaurant, they offer a lot. From Pancakes, to waffles, eggs, toast.. etc. 

I love the chicken mesquite basket! comes with eggs, toast or muffins, fruits or hash browns.  for a reasonable price.  My other favorite is - French Toast. They have the jewish bread, and it is huge enough for two! 

So, yes I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Ballantyne and came over to Brigs on my way home. It was well priced. My food was very good!  Malibu omelet (with avocado, tomatoes, mushrooms) was very good! Hashbrowns were good as well. My girlfriend got a light breakfast with one egg and bacon. Eggs were lukewarm but was good. Asked the manager to sit in a booth instead of a table. She was accommodating. Server was very friendly and on top of things. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Brigs is by far my favorite place to go for breakfast and brunch! My only complaint is that there aren't more locations in Charlotte. Granted-I am biased. I moved to Charlotte from the Raleigh/Durham area where EVERYONE loves Brigs so I was so excited to learn about this location in Ballantyne. The service here is consistent with the experiences I've had going to Brigs weekly back at home: friendly, fast, and yummmmy!! My personal favorite is the traditional Belgian waffle but the French toast is a close second and their omelets are delicious!!"}
{"text":"We were big fans of the restaurant that held this location before Briggs.  So we were really looking forward to the opening of this new place.  We hoped that they would become our new favorite.  Large was our disappointment.

The food was bland...really, really bland.  The atmosphere was that of a 1970s family diner.

We politely paid our bill, left the rest of our food (we only ate a few bites) and left in search of something we could actually eat."}
{"text":"I have been to Brigs for both lunch and breakfast. I'm a fan, but like others, I've had spotty service. Sometimes it is stellar and personable, and sometimes I feel like I'm inconveniencing my server. It's weird.

Anyway, I can't eat eggs OR dairy, so going out for breakfast is usually not that fun for me. But at Brigs, I was impressed with their menu options during breakfast as well as lunch. The food is freshly prepared and tasty. I really can't complain! I love their broccoli salad and sweet potato fries. And they have daily specials that change regularly, so you can always try something new. 

Brigs is easy: Easy to get to, easy to find something you want to eat. Just wish they were a little more consistent from a customer service standpoint."}
{"text":"I went to Briggs two days in a row for breakfast and I have to say I really enjoyed it.  The breakfast croissant with out the bacon was very good and not greasy!  I also indulged in 1 blueberry pancake and 1 pecan pancake, because the size of 1 is HUGE, I would recommend sharing which will help cut calories and fat. The service is really good and the ambiance is better than waffle house, IHOP & cracker barrel. I have not tried their lunch or brunch options, but I'm sure they are just as good with the portion being big.  Enjoy this one!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were regulars at Eddie's so we really wanted to love this place, but it falls short for me.  I've been there three times...two times too many, if I may be honest.  

My husband really likes the potatoes at Brigs (we're from New England and have an affinity for home fries, as oppose to hash browns...and home fries are hard to find in/around Charlotte).  For me, the potatoes aren't nearly good enough to crave going there...particularly for the breakfast fare.  As a matter of fact, the last two times that we went for breakfast, my son and I ordered Chicken Tenders and a BLT, respectively.   They make a decent BLT and my son said that the chicken tenders were \"OK\", but we really wanted to like Brigs enough to make it our go-to breakfast place.   Service is pretty good, the restaurant is clean, and the menu \"looks\" great, but it's just not my cup-of-tea.  Oh well.....the search for a good breakfast place continues...."}
{"text":"This is a good place for breakfast with a wide-ranging menu. The skillets are excellent and when I've explored other parts of the menu, the food can be a little bland. The monthly specials are usually a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Never got to try the food.  We were there on a Sunday at 11:15.  There was a wait.  We asked if we could be seated within 15 min as we had a 1:00 game.  No problem.  After 35 minutes there were still 4 tables ahead of us.  We left.  The host should have been more honest about timing, even if we couldnt wait, we would try another time.  Now I'm not sure.  Under promise and over deliver."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast this morning right around 9:30ish.  There was no line and I was seated quickly.  I had my heart set on pancakes, but I was distracted by the September special, which happened to be blueberry-orange french toast..

I placed my order for the french toast combo which was a half-order of said blueberry-orange french toast along with home fries and turkey sausage links.  I asked that the home fries be cooked well-done.  It wasn't even ten minutes before my food arrived before me.  From a presentation standpoint, the french toast could have been done better, as the blueberry topping and whipped butter was placed on the middle triangle, leaving nothing on the top triangle.  The home fries were well-done as expected and had a great flavor to them.  The turkey sausage was rather uninspiring and a little on the tough side to boot.

The service was pretty top-notch.  Even when I mentioned the tough turkey, the cashier told me he wished I would have let them know sooner and investigated my complaint as soon as I finished paying.  Everybody I came in contact with was friendly.

I'll come back again for breakfast (served all day) and to try those pancakes."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this restaurant to open because I am a breakfast lovin' fool! 

Finally today was the day. Got there at noon and was glad to hear they offer everything on their menu all day! Love it!

The hostess was polite, I think the manager or owner (older man with grey hair) was a bit stand-back-ish, but it could be just a part of his culture... not sure. But what the hell, the rest of the staff was PEACHY. 

We ordered the blackberry pancake short stake, a side of pork sausage, a bacon and cheddar omelet with salsa, and the eggs Florentine Benedict, and a single standard pancake. We all had coffee, so they bring a thermos to your table filled with coffee - nice touch.

Wow! Can I just tell you the portions were amazing! Be sure to come hungry! 

The blackberry pancakes with blackberry syrup was to die for! They bring warm maple syrup and the special syrup of the month to your table. The pancakes were de-lish with fresh blackberries! They reminded us of when we use to pick our own blackberries and my grandmother would wipe up something amazing... that's how good these babies were. 

The omelet was fluffy and full of flavor from the country bacon. And the salsa was incredible. This dish was so yummy, there was NO need for salt or pepper. Seasoned to perfection. 

The sausage side patties were moist and with a lovely taste - especially when dipped into the warm syrup! 

The Benedict was de-lish as well! The hollandaise sauce was incredible light and packed with flavor. The ham was yummy and the egg yolk runny... the way I like it as I love what it does to the hollandaise. Next I order this, I will be sure to tell them to cook the egg white a bit more as it was for my taste just a bit runny. But it didn't stop me from devouring it! 

The single pancake was worth taking a picture of it and framing it! My god, these are what the gods intended on us eating... fluffy buttery pancakes drizzled with warm maple syrup! My mouth is still watering... 

The over all experience was perfect. The staff professional, the restaurant clean and very nicely decorated, and large enough to hold a Sunday after church crowd. 

This is now my favorite place for breakfast.... A great place to dine at. 

Thanks Briggs! You had me at breakfast all day!"}
