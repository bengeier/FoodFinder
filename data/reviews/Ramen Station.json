{"text":"The broth was good.  The noodles were okay.  The meat was pathetic and nothing like the pictures.  Not rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ordered Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen and Takoyaki (Fried Octopus Balls)

Ramen - Portion decent. Came with half an egg prepared well with slightly running yolk, two fish ball pieces (pink swirls), ground meat, large piece of seaweed, and assortment of green onions. Broth was flavorful, and spice was substantial to enjoy. Felt no need to add any sauces or spices to soup. 

Takoyaki - Fried wheat based ball with green onions and cream cheese (gathered from my palate) with small pieces of octopus inside. Covered mayonnaise, a dark sweet sauce, sliced seaweed, and shavings of an unknown food - can be described as opaque, shiny, and like the shaving of quartz, if that would be possible. Fun and enjoyable to eat.

Atmosphere was great. Wait staff was generous with their time and spirits. Restaurant from the entrance to the bathroom was maintained well.

Suggestions - The Tonkotsu Ramen came with ground pork pieces, but I would have preferred to have meat slices. If that is also your preference, look out for those details!"}
{"text":"I've tried several different places over the years (including Tavernakaya, Umami, and Ramen Kid, which ranged from meh to sad) and this is the best in this Ramen-God-forsaken town.

The broth on the tonkatsu, which I consider the most important, was rich and savory. The noodles were neither undercooked nor mushy. The toppings were of an adequate amount. An extremely satisfying meal.

I took a star off for the service. It took a while for the bowls to come out, and our server didn't come to check on us at all throughout the meal.

All in all, highly recommended and I will be back. I hope that their food quality is consistent and that their service kinks will work out over time as they are brand new."}
{"text":"I traveled to Japan multiple times, eating that some of the best ramen restaurant I ever dine at, over there. This place is amazing! Perfect Tonkotsu, perfect egg, perfect chashu, PERFECT! I shall return. :-)"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic and so was the customer service. I placed and order for delivery through EatStreet. Unfortunately, the EatStreet driver never showed up to pick up and deliver the order. Someone from Ramen Station personally delivered my food and profusely apologized. This is a business that not only serves up good food but also knows how to treat their customers."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning the night after eating here for dinner... spent my whole Saturday vomiting, so it's safe to say the food wasn't worth the price of admission. Oh, and I had to miss the beer and cheese festival because of that - thanks, Ramen Station!

This was my first (and only) visit. I had the sesame Ramen along with some strange mush-filled spring rolls. And you know what I didn't have on Saturday because of this? Beer and cheese.

As some others have noted, eat here at your own risk. Or go to Umami instead. Or just heat up a 99 cent packet at home if you're really feeling adventurous."}
{"text":"Had to try this place as soon as I heard of it, and it was really good.  I will definitely return,  it's delicious and a nice change of pace from the norm."}
{"text":"The four times I have eaten here I have really enjoyed every dish I have ordered. 
I love that they serve takoyaki and that they do it well.  Very few places in Madison seem to make them and that is too bad.  
The yakitori is amazing. I have had every skewer they offer and all were tasty. Yet another thing very few restaurants in Madison offer.
The ramen is spot on and as good as any other option in Madison.  There are definitely better ramen restaurants to eat at but they are no where near Madison."}
{"text":"Service was good, but I'm not rating for service. The food was okay. We ordered lamb skewers but there was barely any lamb on the skewers. The gyoza and seaweed salad were good. The mackerel (I think) was the best appetizer we ordered. The tako yaki tasted good but for $5, I'd expect more than 4. I always thought a typical order was 6. 

I ordered the Special Spicy Tonktasu Ramen. It seems like several previous visitors also ordered the special. Might as well place it on the menu if your special is a daily option. It was okay. Not spicy. The Korean Nongshim Shin Noodle instant ramen is spicier and more flavorful (in my opinion). Similar to other diners, I prefer the sliced pork over the ground pork. The broth was okay and the noodles were not chewy and dense. 

I forget what the other diners ordered but they seemed to like their food, though no one finished the broth. One diner had so much broth left, the server thought he wasn't finished and asked if he wanted a to-go box. lol. 

For about $10/bowl, I probably won't be back. I'm not a ramen specialist, but the unhealthy instant ramen (Mama, WaiWai, Sapporo Ichiban, Nongshim Shin) taste better and are A LOT cheaper."}
{"text":"Is it bad that I went to a Ramen noodle place and liked the fried rice the best? The meat (beef and chicken) seemed a bit chewy and \"lower grade\" to me. But that rice....mmmm! I'd go back for it if I was in the area."}
{"text":"The skewers are so tasty!!!! Ramen is average but as good as you can find in Madison."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night with a group of four. The interior is spacious and clean, and we all ordered different types of ramen.  The tonkatsu ramen was delicious -- the broth was savory and substantial, and quite a few pork slices were included!  The presentation was stylish as well.  Everyone left with full tummies and no complaints.  They also have their own parking lot!"}
{"text":"Had lunch ramen Station , ordered spicy Tonkotsu , the Best ramen ever ! Server friendly . Even little away from downtown definitely worth it highly recommended !"}
{"text":"Good but not great been there twice and the spicy tonkatsu ramen was definitely my favorite."}
{"text":"I'm somewhere between 2 stars (Meh) and the 3 I'm giving them.  

I thought the gyoza were good and the vegetable skewers were fun and different and yummy.  But the main dish I ordered was not enjoyable to eat.  I got the stir fried udon with chicken.  The sauce was very oily and the chicken was quite fatty and rubbery.  Just not at all appealing.  I picked at it and probably ate a fifth of it.  The server offered to wrap it up but I declined.  (And I never say no to leftovers!)

When I expressed that I was less than excited about the food to my dining companions, they suggested I only had myself to blame for ordering something other than Ramen.  Perhaps a fair point.  So, again, giving Ramen Station the benefit of the doubt.  But I still won't be eager to return any time soon."}
{"text":"I've visited this place a couple of times. Overall food is about average; for the most recent visit I had Gyuunika ramen which was very delicious, one of the best ramen I have in town. They do have a good selection of appetizers and skewers; although the waitress forgot to tell us that the skewers we ordered were sold out until we finished our ramen. Parking is a plus. If you want ramen without all the stress of looking for park and waiting in line this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I was excited that there was a new ramen place in town. But I was disappointed in the end. 

I ordered the tonkotsu miso ramen and karaage. 
The broth was very salty, when i mentioned this to my waitress she graciously brought it back to the kitchen where they added more liquid to make it less salty. That made it edible but otherwise the general flavor was lacking. The egg didn't have much flavor but the pork belly was good. I would have appreciated more noodles since they were quickly gone.

The karaage wasn't edible. It was more rubbery than crispy and looked (and tasted) as though it had been rolled in msg and/or salt. I had two bites and couldn't eat another. My lips were caked in salt. 

Not impressed overall. Hope they can make some improvements."}
{"text":"Biggest disappointment! According to the WSJ, the chef lived in Japan for 12 years and worked for a ramen restaurant. The portion size was expensive, the bowl presentation was not attractive, and the broth was just TERRIBLE!!! If they where in Chicagoland area it won't last. I think the Chef need to go back to Japan and learn how to cook ramen. I definitely prefer Ramen Kid over Ramen Station."}
{"text":"We came in around peak lunch hours and we were surprised how empty it was, but we soon realized that this place does a lot of carry out.

We were pretty hungry and opted for one of the lunch specials: the okonomiyaki, a seafood pancake. It was super crispy on the outside and hot and gooey inside; the sauce on top wasn't too sweet either and there was the right amount of mayo too. Definitely would order that again, and great to share with a friend!

I had the gyuunika ramen, which was absolutely delicious: spicy, not too salty, a well done egg, and good noodle consistency. The value was also great; it was cheaper ramen compared to places to downtown without compromising quality. 

Service was super fast, our waitress was attentive, and I will be coming back for sure in the future to fill up on more ramen! Ramen Station is worth stopping by and fills any ramen craving you might have. No worries if you're not a huge ramen fan either, there are plenty of other non-noodle dishes on the menu too."}
{"text":"It's great to have ramen not downtown or downtown-ish. Park street seems to be on the way to or from a lot of things, as opposed to the other ramen offerings around.

This place is large, spacious, and open fairly late. Staff is nice enough and there are Asian beer options, so I can't complain. It's definitely a more relaxed, casual feel. Parking lot on site, another bonus compared to competitors.

I have tried a couple of ramens here, both very hot, rich. There were a little less noodles than I typically find, average amount of toppings. They offer a number of small grilled items, dumplings, and other goodies to try on future visits."}
{"text":"It was not what I expected. Regular Asian flavor nothing to impressed!  The kid's noodles soup was plain with noddles and one small piece of meat."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim, and kind of expected a to-go type restaurant (although I think that is an option). I was really put off by the smell, I wish I was exaggerating, but it smells like straight up sulfur, which in a food setting is extremely gross to me (honestly it could have been a weird situation that night, so don't take that seriously to heart unless you smell it too)
My boyfriend got one of the ramen bowls, but I just got chicken fried rice because I wasn't particularly too crazy about coming here. It was your typical fried rice so there was nothing too special about that. My boyfriend said his ramen was alright, he's had better."}
{"text":"Bad food, but at least you can wait for 2+ hours for delivery! Ramen station had it ready, but their delivery service Eat Street just didn't pick it up for delivery. Had to call both the restaurant and Eat Street to get this done after 1.5 hours. Food arrived cold, so you know they used the original food and didnt cook something fresh when they learned Eat Street's pick up time. Wouldn't order from them again just based on this. Bummer they chose a poor delivery service. Even worse they just make bad food."}
{"text":"I will rarely write a review after a single visit to a restaurant, cafe, or food establishment. Unless some aspect(s) of the experience is an outer body enchantment. That being said, I waited until my 4th visit/3rd check-in to write this little diddy. *Wah wah*

Ramen Station is not an outer body experience. But is is A.O.K.  

I love ramen. Who doesn't?! Ramen for breakfast, lunch, dinner, late-night snack. It's salty, comforting and an all-around slurpy yumminess that allows me to fill my tummy with while shelling out less $$$! Madison has a number of ramen, pho, and noodle-soup establishments, and to my surprise (maybe it's just me? I sure hope not!), few really make me want to come back for seconds or thirds.

The skewer appetizer offerings are fine. Nothing to rave about. Endamame is difficult to ruin. Dumplings are good (just never enough in one order...can I get an amen?!?!). The ramen bowls are run-of-the-mill. Flavor-wise, it's just nothing special. Not much for yummy veggies floating around in the salty, tantalizing broth selections but sprouts. 

Give me some julienne carrots, green onion, basil, mushrooms. Please?

The last time I dined here, I ordered the seafood ramen - the shrimp was not shelled and awful to eat. I was picking pieces shell out of my mouth the entire time. So unpleasant!

The bathrooms have been very clean each time I venture into one. That's quite appreciated, to be honest!

Service has always been quick, snappy, and responsive. 

Overall, again...nothing ravenous. Extremely mediocre."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have discovered Ramen Station. I've had the ramen at three other locations in Madison. I was disappointed in them all. Ramen Station didn't disappoint. There are a variety of ramens to choose from. The primary difference is their broths although there is some variation in proteins available also. I choose the ramen with spicy pork sausage. The broth was delicious and it was loaded with noodles, plenty of sausage, fish cake, a hard-boiled egg and various vegetables. 

Ramen Station also has a variety of skewers. My favorite is the calamari skewer which was two skewers of squid fillet. Grilled perfectly with just a hint of sauce. We also tried the bacon wrapped mushroom skewers and the mackerel pike skewer.

The building is clean and modern with plenty of off-street parking. Our server was prompt and courteous. Our food was delivered quickly. The prices were very reasonable. If you are looking for ramen in Madison, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Went on opening day for lunch. The place is beautiful!  However the ramen is just ok. If the broth had more depth it would be really good but it was just average. I've had a lot better.  Noodles were so so.
The BROTH is the key. Do this well and you will do well. Good start but needs improvement"}
{"text":"Was itching for some Japanese food so we tried this place for dinner last night. I appreciated the super fast delivery. I ordered Yakisoba with beef and hubby ordered Japanese curry with chicken. He also ordered some shumai to start. I appreciated all the veggies in my yakisoba. It was pretty decent. I have lived in Japan so it's not the best Yakisoba in the world but it was good. Hubby said the curry was good too. Not as good as mine, but he said it was decent. The shumai was good too. Overall I say it's a very decent place to get quick Japanese food."}
{"text":"Service was on par, although I did hear the waitress complain about getting a small tip from the table next to us. One of the diners wanted Sriracha sauce to add to the ramen and was told there was none. Which led to a full blown inquiry amongst her friends of whether they were at a Japanese restaurant or not and why wouldn't they have Sriracha. Our seating was too close to others and that constant complaining was getting in on our dining experience. 

The ramen was ok. The noodles didn't meld with the broth as much as I had hoped and tasted as though it had been recently boiled (which is good) but lacked that oomph. Hubs got the sesame ramen, but under the lighting, we couldn't tell what it was until we got home and poured out the leftovers. It was a white broth, not yellow (from the lighting). There wasn't much flavor to the sesame ramen, but thankfully, I ordered the more flavorful shoyu tonkatsu. The appetizers were decent. We ordered the skewered shrimp and curry chicken wings. One of my wings, which was larger than the other two, was undercooked. 

We'll try it again once things get more established..maybe."}
{"text":"Good service and pretty decor.

Food was overpriced for the poor quality. I got sick right away :("}
{"text":"Service was friendly and quite fast - that usually results in an automatic boost in my rating since this CAN be a killer if its the opposite. I tried the vegetarian ramen which I am kind of a noob in regards to so I can only really compare it to Vegetarian pho-although they are different beasts. Serving size/price was very fair with a heaping large bowl. I highly recommend adding hot sauce to the broth with this as the white broth was very neutral flavored...or maybe I just like spicy food. I'll definitely try there again after a farmer's market or something."}
{"text":"Excellent service, glasses were never empty.  This was a bit of a new experience for us as we haven't frequented similar restaurants. I had the Miso Ramen and loved it!! Hubby had a Yuko Beef and it was very yummy, they made it spicy on request.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I am glad that Madison has finally got aboard the ramen train and it is picking up speed.   But I find Ramen Station  somewhat meh and you may want to consider staying on board and moving on to the next stop.

For the uninitiated, ramen is Japanese and traditionally a bowl of soup with noodles with various condiments. There are variations on the broth such as miso, soy sauce (shoyu), pork, fish, etc., with miso and shoyu being most common.  Condiments can include fishcake, barbecued pork, shrimp, beef, green onions, seaweed, a hard-boiled egg, etc.  Though a hearty comfort food, there are many purists and getting it just right can take a lot of hard work and talent.  Some will turn up their nose at noodles not quite done right or broth which is too salty or not salty enough, etc. Me, if it tastes good, I eat it.  Not too hard to please, as my figure indicates. 

Ramen Station is a beautiful little restaurant. It is on the small side but is very well lit and has a modern feel.  They have tables, as well as a bar where you can watch the chefs prepare food.  Cool!  Also they have a smaller area for more of a private meal or meeting which looked very nice.  The tableware is also very beautiful.

We went there for lunch on a Friday and were surprised that they neither offer a lunch menu nor any particular lunch specials.  They have a sandwich board just inside the front door which lists some items. But the waitress indicated they were simply items off the menu and not particularly special that day.  

Between us, we ordered the miso tonkotsu ramen, stirfried chicken udon and the miso tonkotsu ramen with udon noodles substituted for ramen noodles.  We also had an order of panfried gyoza. 

All of the dishes came out looking very tasty and umami filled!  The pork in the tonkotsu was soft and delicate but it seemed to have been cooked or boiled so that much of its flavor had leeched out. The same concern was had for the ramen bowls in general. They looked very tasty and delicious.  But the flavors were pedestrian and not as tasty as their appearances would suggest.  I apologize Ramen Station, but I was underwhelmed.

The chicken in the stir fried udon dish was extremely fatty.  I know many like chicken fat especially when it is grilled and there is a little char and crunchiness to it. The chicken was not grilled to get any type of char or crisp on it and was unappetizing. The chicken pieces were small and difficult to separate from the noodles and vegetables so some particular extra chopstick work was needed and most of it remained on my wife's plate.  

The serving sizes were okay. But to me, the prices seem steep for the servings, particularly at lunch.

You can also order skewers of side accompaniments such as shrimp and mushrooms. We also ordered a mushroom skewer which was a few button mushrooms slightly marinated in teriyaki sauce and grilled. They were just warmed through with no char on them. Would not order again.

The gyoza was also just okay and unremarkable.  Could've been from any other fast food restaurant in town or out of a bag.  Not bad. Just not remarkable and surprisingly mediocre given the otherwise lovely upscale surroundings and placesettings.

Service was good though!  Very nice people.

I wish them the best of luck and do like a lot of the things they are doing. The decor and plateware are beautiful and there is parking!  But prices seem high for mediocre food which some would say is just a stop on the ramen fad railway.  

I may give them another go one day. Until then - - and I know it is Chinese cuisine--but I will likely stay on the train and get off at Mini Hot Pot just down the street when I have a hankering for any type of Asian noodle soup.   

Two Yelp stars for the food (meaning I would only go there if I could not politely advocate for a different spot).  For the decor, four.  On average, three stars."}
{"text":"Was on a 3day vacation in Baraboo. Went to Madison for some ramen cravings and found this place. Ramen and service was very good. We enjoyed some tasty appetizers. Fried green tea icecream is a must try! Will come back definitely! Keep up the good food and service please."}
{"text":"I might of hit during an off-day, but I simply wasn't impressed. Got the Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen (overpriced at lunch for $11.95). The broth was pretty flat and boring for ramen and I didn't find anything special about it. I actually thought Ramen Kid was much better."}
{"text":"Best place of ramen and skewer in Madison. I ordered the squid skewer and tokoyso miso ramen. Like it very much!"}
{"text":"I came in around noonish on  Sunday and wondered why the place was mostly empty.  I didn't notice people picking up so I wasn't aware of the take-out service level.

There were 3 of us in our party - the menu looked good so we sat down and quickly ordered.  We ordered 2 ramen soups, 1 Yaki Udon (chicken) and 2 appetizers.  The 2 ramen soups and 1 appetizer arrived very quickly.  The other appetizer and Udon arrived 8-10 minutes later by which time my companions were mostly done with both of their meals.  My food was dropped off without a word and the waitress quickly tried to hustle away.  I don't believe she was hiding but just trying to drop more orders off or some other task.  

I did ask why my food was so late - \"Its not late - takes longer\".  The noodles are larger but should not take much longer and why don't you try time it so you cook the food to be delivered to the table all at once - there are only 3 of us.  Appetizers usually show up before the main dish....\"

I came to the conclusion that this was standard - not an abnormal situation and neither the staff or the cooks expect the food to get to your table at the same time or any particular order.

Between the 3 of us - we also got mixed reviews on the quality/tastiness of the meals.  It ranged from \"best fried fish\" to very bland.

When I go to a venue to eat with friends or family - I'd actually like to eat with friends and family - if the food isn't going to arrive together or close together - I'd like to hear about it while ordering - it would give me a chance to make an informed decision. 

I never got an apology and when talking with the staff it was obvious that they felt this was normal and why apologize for normal.

There are too many other places that serve great food and have great service in Madison."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this review simple: Don't eat here.
A) Food not very tasty
B) Some of it (tako yaki) will actually make you sick
Too bad. The decor is beautiful and the service adequate."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to be in the area for lunch, earlier this week.  While this place has been on my radar for quite some time, I know little more about ramen than what is sold for 10 cents a pack at the grocery store. From what I have heard, Ramen Station is as close to authentic for this type of cuisine as you can get in the Madison area. Had to give it a try. 

The restaurant is clean and inviting. The service is attentive and the food is great. We 
started with gyoza, which may be some of the best I have ever had. While the filling was flavorful, the wrapper of the gyoza was delicate and without that acrid, fried after-taste. It was quite a pleasant surprise for the start of our meal. I went with the Sesame ramen that features braised pork. My wife went with the Udon noodles, adding beef for an additional two dollars.  Ramen Station has something on the menu that I have always wanted to try but never had the opportunity: Tako yaki.  Once again, I have no frame of reference but these burning hot spheres of dough are something to behold. Fishy and with the texture of a fritter, along with a hunk of octopus on the inside... it is almost difficult to describe but was definitely a welcome experience.    When it came to the ramen, the whole is definitely greater than the sum of the parts.  Every ingredient and aspect of the dish works together in harmony.  The flavor of the broth was subtle with sesame and the braised pork was incredibly tender. I will definitely make the trip back to try the Miso-ramen or the spicy Gyuunika ramen.  The Udon noodles delivered on flavor and texture.  The only disappointment came in the form of the 5 skinny pieces of beef accompanying the noodles.  Was hoping to get more beef/beef flavor along with the upcharge.  

Otherwise, this is a great place if you are looking to try something new and different, all while near an accessible location.  Parking may be an issue with the smaller lot on a busy evening, but Park Street and the neighborhood allow for other options.  
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try this, but wasn't too impressed.  The gyoza dumplings were OK.  I don't have ramen often, but I found the brown egg in my ramen a little strange.  Overall, just OK."}
{"text":"I'm being generous and giving this place 4 stars, I'm hoping they will grow and improve over time... Anywhere serving bowls of noodles and pork, I'm a fan.

It was a Sunday afternoon when we went, and I'm happy to say the service was great, food came out quickly, and there were several other tables filling the place! 

We ordered - gyoza, bacon enoki skewers,"}
{"text":"We had a few skewers to start and they were very nice.
The tonkatsu ramen was very good, as said before the egg was a little over cooked but the broth was nice and the pork slices were very good fell apart into nice little bits to eat with the noodles.

So the service was very good to.  I will be going back, and back."}
{"text":"Ramen Station has been my go to ramen restaurant in Madison for ever since they've been opened. I love the Tonkatsu Ramen. The broth is creamy but perfectly light, the flavor is perfect because it's not too salty. The noodles an enjoyable texture and size. The pork slices in the ramen is so soft that it falls apart in your mouth. I grew up noodles with meat in the broth and have never been a fan of meat in noodles until I experienced this Tonkatsu ramen bowl. Over the last couple years, they've been adding more things to their appetizers. Most of their appetizers are simple skewers coated with a delicious sauce. I would highly recommend Ramen Station if you like to keep your ramen experience simple."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!!!!  Opened by local sushi restauranteurs for the non-sushi crowd!  THIS SOUP IS GOOD!!!!  #get_at_it"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and have always enjoyed their ramen. I like their ramen but I actually prefer Ramen Kid when eating ramen in Madison. This time I got yakitori instead of ramen and it was delicious. If you come here make sure you order the squid and chicken with scallions yakitori--it's delicious."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open up!

I started off with karaage. I found the meat itself to be nice and moist, but the batter was not crispy enough. I probably wont order that again.

I got miso tonkatsu ramen. Let's break it down:

The bowl was presented nicely with noodles and bean sprouts holding the chashu under the broth (which is where i like to put it when i start eating), and menma, soft boiled marinated egg, naruto, and nori shaped like a flower (kawaii!!!).

I wish the bowl came with a little more noodle because they seemed to be gone in my tummy pretty quickly. It's also worth noting that this is the first time i found naruto at a restaurant in Madison. The menma was relatively flavorless, and the egg was slightly overcooked for being soft boiled.

The chashu retained a distinct pork flavor and still had a lot its fatty moisture well distributed in the dark meat. The slices were just a hair too thick for my preference, but it was still pretty good. It really had a melt-in-your mouth texture, but I didnt find it to be as good of broth sponge as Ramen Kid's.

Now, this broth is where the ramen shined. If Ramen Kid's miso broth is rock n roll, Ramen Station's miso tonkotsu broth is jazz. It wasnt overly salty, allowing the delicate nuances of miso to shine. It was a little sweet and nutty from the miso, meaty from the tonkotsu (although not creamy), and slightly spicy on the finish (perhaps from ginger). This balance between delicate miso and meaty tonkotsu is quite something.

Atmosphere-wise, it feels more likely a traditional asian restaurant than Ramen Kid or Umami.

If you want your bowl of ramen to be a huge amount of food, Ramen Kid and Umami do a better job with that. However, Ramen Station provides the most well-balanced ramen of the three."}
{"text":"Now with Ramen Station open, there are (at least) four ramen places available in Madison (here, Ramen Kid, Umami, and Tavernakaya). In my mission to be the foremost ramen expert in Madison, I gave this place a try during lunch.

My order was the tonkotsu ramen with pork broth, and I split some edamame with my lunch friend. They have several options of broth, including pork and miso. The ramen came with nori, soft-boiled egg, and bamboo shoots as well as beansprouts and a slice of kamaboko, which no other ramen place adds to their ramen.

All in all, this ramen is done correctly, if not spectacularly. The broth is savory and made from real meat/bones. It's not as salty as the other ramen places that I tried, so if, say, you found Ramen Kid's broth too salty, then this might be a better alternative for you. I appreciated the extra things that they threw in to the ramen, and the noodles had good texture as well. They gave a good proportion of pork, though it seems that they used a very lean cut because the meat crumbled during the course of the meal. I think you're supposed to use fattier slices of meat for ramen, and the ramen itself could use a bit more fat to make it heartier as a whole.

I think of this place as a younger brother to Ramen Kid or Tavernakaya. They've gone through the motions of making proper ramen, and they followed the rules and conventions that makes ramen good, but they're still amateurs. They're more expensive than Ramen Kid, and have fewer amenities than Tavernakaya, so it's in an awkward place when sized up to the competition. If you live near here, then it's a convenient place that you can stop by for lunch, but I'm not sure it'd be worth schlepping out to give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Super yummy ramen!  There were three of us and we each ordered three different broths.  When I tasted each, they were all different and full of unique flavor.  The ramen noodle was perfectly chewy and dense.  I felt the meats were substantial and other ingredients such as fish patty and hard boiled egg were perfectly suited.  We tried the skewers and calamari appetizers- those could've been a little more tasty.  But the ramen is what you should eat when you go here.  The space is super cute and surprisingly spacious.  There is parking too.  Excited this place is here.  A bowl of ramen runs approx. $10.99 each.  Service was efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"I went here with friends. We had two different kinds of ramen, fried rice, and yaki soba. I don't have much to say simply because there wasn't much to it.

The over all word of the night was 'bland'. Everything was under spiced. Both ramens were a bland broth with bland noodles. The fish cakes and pork in the ramen was quite good, but it's not enough to make the ramen bowl. The egg was a little small and bland for what I'm used to as well.

The fried rice was the only good dish, but I'd personally rather get a box from a random take out place like Double 10. 

The restaurant is gorgeous. The decorations and large booths are quite lovely. Apparently the place is run by the same people who run Takara. It has the same \"meh\" food, nice allure feel. For me, the owners are a deal breaker anyway as the worst dining experience I've ever had was at Takara. I also had a small miscommunication issue at Ramen Station about drinks, but not enough to cause a fuss.

I'm giving two stars as the food wasn't actively bad. I imagine it would be a fine place if you wanted to go out, but every where else was busy.

Edit: Since I received quite the rude message over this, my example of getting fried rice from Double 10 is showing that while the fried rice here was good it was not beyond what you'd expect from a take out place."}
{"text":"Made a last minute trip to Madison, and my friend told me good things about this place.

I ordered their special of the day, spicy tonkotsu ramen, and gyoza (pan fried chicken dumplings). 

The gyoza came out first, and it was pretty good. Not much to say about it.

The spicy tonkotsu ramen came after, and the broth was delicious. The broth had a great creamy pork flavor, and the spiciness adds to that. Everything was cooked well (noodles, eggs, fish cake, etc.). It also came with ground pork, which I did not know how to feel about because i really like my tonkotsu ramen with pork slabs. It was actually pretty good because each time I dipped my spoon for soup, there would also be the ground pork goodies. 

I tried my friend's regular tonkotsu ramen, and it was good but more plain because of no spiciness. However, the regular tonkotsu ramen came with pork slabs, and it was super delicious. It literally melted in my mouth.

Overall, ramen station is good with their specialty, ramen. I did not experience any flaws. I definitely knocked out on the ride home. 

Would come again when I'm back in town. I really want to try their other ramen and their skewers."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and was pretty disappointed. When we walked in, the place smelled like fish and vinegar which should have been our sign to go elsewhere. But we ordered some spring rolls, bacon wrapped mushrooms, and ramen bowls (miso and clear chicken broth). The spring rolls were delicious-which is why I'm giving them 2 stars. The mushrooms were ok but they were tiny little tentacle like things and the texture of them was not good- rubbery. Once our ramen came out they both smelled like fish (we assumed it was the seaweed and took that out immediately- (we ordered ours without the \"fish cakes\" as well). They both were not good, they were fishy and had an odd flavor that I can not put my dinner on. I felt like I was going to vomit while trying to eat them. We left without finishing."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed with this place. I really wanted it to be good, as ramen options in madison is lacking in my opinion. 

I got the shumai as an appetizer and the shoyu ramen. The shumai tasted store bought. In fact, I think I've purchased those exact shumai from Trader Joe's. It was gummy and flavorless, and for 4.50 I got 6 tiny (size of a finger tip) dumplings. 

The shoyu ramen was not great either. The egg looked old, the yolk was shriveled and discolored. The chasu was incredibly overcooked and lacking in any fat, which made it very dry. Bamboo shoots straight out of a jar. The broth didn't have much character either, I had to pour in some soy sauce to get a semblance of flavor in my soup. Noodles were cooked well, but needed seasoning. 

Service wasn't great. They seemed to have one person working as the host and server so I don't think it was really his fault. 

2 stars - food was inoffensive to the point of not having any flavor. But I know it could have been a lot worse."}
{"text":"Got excited to see a ramen place.  Left unimpressed.  Service was barely there.  I had the curry chicken katsu.  It was weird.  The taste was just okay.  The curry had mushrooms in it which was kind of strange, but the topper was when I bit into what I thought was a piece of potato and I couldn't quite figure out what it was.  And, then it hit me. It was a whole mushy clove of garlic.  There is not one Japanese person working in this place, so don't think you are getting the real deal.  The chicken katsu covered in the curry was just okay.  

My son had the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen and a Chicken Skewer.  The ramen was nothing special.  The soup was unremarkable.  The chicken skewer came out looking pretty tasty. They fooled us.  I am pretty sure they fried the chicken pieces and fried them way too much.  They were tough and crunchy.  I was seriously questioning if they were chicken or not.  He ate one bite, I ate one bite, we decided it all bites, and left it on the table.

Oh, check out the decor.  It looks like they paid to have an upholsterer take every remnant and create seating.  There is also a strange private booth with a totally different bright floral background.  It's pretty funny. Oh well, we had no drinks and for the ramen, curry katsu, and chicken skewer our bill was about $28.  Thought this was a little much for lunch of this caliber.  Oh, and service was non-existent."}
{"text":"I hate to give a less than stellar review, especially to a place just starting up, but serious meh on this one.

What I tried:
Spring rolls- These had an oddly mushy filling. Never had a spring roll like that, and not in a good way. They were relatively flavorful, but I did not like the texture of the innards.
Vegetarian Ramen w/ added soft boiled egg (+$1)- very underwhelming. Just didn't have very much flavor, so I added a healthy amount of soy sauce to the broth for some sodium. The veggies were fine (bamboo shoots, cabbage, carrot, celery, and mushrooms), but I would have liked to have seen sprouts, snap peas or tofu as some options.

The extras are not listed on the menu, you have to ask. So customizing your ramen is quite hard. Prepare yourself to ask a lot of questions.

I think it's worth a try, but I probably wont be back any time soon."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I really love it. The miso ramen is delish and fast to the table. The service could be better, but I'm hoping that will get better in time."}
{"text":"It's serviceable - not bad but not great. I though here was sort of strange odor to the place. Many of the Ramen choices game with processed fish cake. I'm just not interested in faux fish anything. The broth was OK but not rich and savory as I had expected. The service was decent and the Ramen came out quickly and hot."}
{"text":"Place is packed for dinner the first night! Food is wonderful and everyone seems pretty happy. The whole mackerel is pretty awesome. 

Come try them now before you must wait forever to get a table"}
{"text":"We are back again we  order to go food  this time wow even there to go containers are worth saving. My only complaint is I wish We lived closer. Super clean place. Friendly service"}
{"text":"For anyone looking for delicious authentic Ramen, this is the place to go! I was greeted right away by the very friendly staff, and the atmosphere is calming and very clean. 

They have so many great choices with Ramen and many other delicious items such as their seaweed salad! I ordered the Tonkotsu Miso Ramen. It has a little more kick than the traditional Tonkotsu, however, both are delicious! The soup is delicate and seasoned just right, the chasu (pork) was cooked to perfection and practically melts in your mouth. The egg was cooked perfectly as well....not too gooey and not overdone. Noodles are excellent as well. I've been to Japan, and the ramen here is right on target!!!"}
{"text":"I'm curious to go back and try their non-ramen options, because the ramen is underwhelming. The noodles are super eggy, which I like, but that's really it's only notable feature. It's pretty standard fare, so expect a decent bowl at a decent price."}
{"text":"Holy, flipping wow! To say dinner was good would be an insult. By far, the best bowl of ramen I've had in years. I absolutely must come back. The hours here are different from what I expected, but with food like this, I will wait for them to open.  I ordered a spicy ramen, the spicy level was good. I would have been happy with twice as spicy, but oh man, the flavor is there in spades! Great place. I should mention that the customer service is excellent as well. Good atmosphere. I didn't care for the music, but I'm odd so don't let that put anyone off. Did I mention the food was great?!"}
{"text":"Below average ramen shop. The skewers are nice but nothing special; the miso broth is bad ( basically water, salt, and msg); but the tonkatsu is delicious. My biggest complaint is the cuts of their pork. Normally meat slices in ramen consist of belly or shoulder cuts - the extra fat adding flavor depth to the broth. At Ramen Station, however, the cuts are thick, lean, and dry. It brings nothing to the bowl other than an unpleasant texture. As for the egg, which is another essential ingredient in the ramen, while i did like the marinate on the egg white, it was over cooked. The yolk should be extra runny so it blends into the broth for extra richness. 

As a specialty ramen shop, i was quite disappointed by the overall quality of their product. I felt it was no better than your average ramen from any japanese/asian fusion restaurant. I will stay with umami for a proper bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"Love the food here. I had the tongkatsu ramen and it was the best I have tried in madison. Also the calamari was very good and crispy. Service was also good. I will be coming back to try everything else on the menu. It's that good."}
{"text":"The ramen is alright. Noodles are cooked decently. Meat is well cooked. The egg is unfortunately not soft boiled (though it always looks like they tried). The broth is decent but lacks depth of flavor. This place is pretty on-par with some other ramen establishments in Madison and a lot better than the god-awful Umami. If you want to scratch your ramen itch but don't want to drive all the way to Chicago for the good stuff, I'd suggest going here or Morris ramen."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this place. The inside is decorated really nicely and the staff is friendly. The food was really tasty and the portions generous. The meat skewers were the highlight of my meal. I had ramen and calamari as well, both were yummy. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised by the taste of my miso ramen. I tried it as it came out of the kitchen and it had lots of flavor. I prefer to have a little heat in my food though. On the tables, they have a spicy mix that you can sprinkle on your food. This was a fantastic addition to my ramen. My dining partner did the same with his food (shoyu ramen). He liked the addition also. I'm a super fan of the soft boiled eggs in the dish too. I'm bummed that there was only one in the bowl though. MORE eggs please (at least one more in the bowl)! I could get a side order of these for every meal. We had the place pretty much to ourselves, so I didn't see other meals coming out of the kitchen. I'm excited for a return trip though."}
{"text":"So far I'm impressed! I've only ordered take out twice, but the food was done quickly and very fresh! 

I order ramen for take out usually, and always love when the broth and noodles are separated so as to keep the noodles from getting soggy. It makes me happy to see the take out is packaged well for ramen. 

My least favorite thing so far was the veggie broth, which has a weird aftertaste, sort of plastic-y. But the pork tonkatsu and broth tastes great!

I haven't ordered much else yet, but my view on take out seemed important enough to talk about! I think there's value in a restaurant's take out quality, and I liked theirs a lot."}
{"text":"I had the tonkotsu ramen here. I really liked the flavor of the ramen and the meat was pretty good. However the noodles themselves were not to my liking. The texture was kind of similar to packaged ramen, it was sort of slippery and mushy."}
{"text":"Gave it a try....May come back in a few months to see if it got better.  The up side, they have easy parking...and its free.

We all had one type of ramen.  Each was good in its own way.  Nothing really jumped out at us.  I may have walked in hopping for much more, allowing me to be disappointed easier.  They are very new, and are still woking out the kinks.  Over all they were Bland...with not much spice or flavor.  

Staff is very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I had the tonkatsu ramen, stir fry (udon) with fried chicken.
The broth for the ramen is good, not with a heavily salty flavor. The chashu was also moist and tender, but there were only two tiny pieces in the whole bowl, totally not like what they showed on the menu photos. And the marinated egg was overcooked a bit.
Everything tastes good, but I wouldn't say it's a Japanese restaurant. It's more like Chinese to me. I thought the fried chicken would be like the Japanese ones with a slight of lemon on top. But it was more like the Chinese-style chicken popcorn. 
The udon was ok, but really, it's more like Chinese style stir fry.
The service and atmosphere are both really good. But I wouldn't come back often. Will recommend the other ramen place on state st more."}
{"text":"Live on the near south side of downtown?  Looking for ramen?  Well you have to visit Ramen Station.  I have eaten there many times mostly for take out and they have never disappointed!  My goto is the Tonkotsu Miso Ramen, which is a pork broth with sliced pork tenderloin and it's so good!  If you like spicy food ask to have the Tonkotso made spicy.  They have a Spicy Tonkotsu; however it comes with ground pork, which doesn't compare to the sliced pork tenderloin.  For an app you can't go wrong with the Gyoza and I also get a side of the the Japanese fried rice."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my first time here.  I ordered the fried chicken appetizer and a spicy ramen extra extra spicy.  Well, my ramen came first and it was not spicy nor was the broth warm.  The eggs and the ramen noodles weren't bad but the braised pork was tough.  Ten minutes later my appetizer came.  It was also bland."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen in Madison! Come to Madison several times for business. This place is always my first choice for food. Great food with reasonable price. Good for group as well. Have enough parking space is another plus."}
{"text":"Tried for dinner. The waitstaff was very pleasant and the place appeared bright and clean.  But I kind of felt like the ramen was missing something. Not sure what. The jasmine hot tea was very good though. We will most likely give it another try."}
