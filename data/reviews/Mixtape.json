{"text":"Mixtape is amazing! There are so many vegan options across the board and the food and drinks are to die for! We went there for brunch on Saturday and I got The Tempeh Trap (breakfast sandwich that came with a spring mix salad with fresh cherry tomatoes and balsamic) and That Apple Pie (OMG french toast like panini w/ cinnamon cream cheeze and apples) and my girlfriend got The Tempeh-Tations and Livin' La Vida Loca (mocha coffee frapp). They were all incredibly delicious and all plant-based. The owner Katie and employee Stacey were so considerate and sweet. We played some of my favorite board games (they have a kickass selection) and they have a craft station to make ornaments! We each made really pretty ornaments (paint, glitter, gems). They have the best self-serve options for coffee add-ins. The vibe and decorations are sleek but welcoming and comfortable. There are cool paintings on the walls. I cannot recommend this place enough. I'm so excited to check out their dinner menu! They serve drinks at the bar which look very unique and tasty. There's a walk up counter for ordering and you can call in to order for pickup as well."}
{"text":"This place is the best. Great fun and comfortable vibe - comfy furniture and games - we find our corner and settle in. Katie makes the best craft cocktails around. I tasted this smokey bourbon drink from the fall menu and it was so well balanced and smooth - yum. They create really interesting drinks and are always changing up the menu. It's our #1 go to place for a great cocktail."}
{"text":"Mixtape is a wonderful little eatery and bar.  I have not tried the daytime menu, but the handful of food items they serve in the evening are tasty and very fairly priced.  This coupled with a creative drink selection from cocktails to wine to beer all at fair prices that include the tip and you have a terrific combination.  Add onto that a chic ambience and its a place to get out with friends or a SO to relax."}
{"text":"Went here for the new year eve and it was fun! People were friendly and you dont have to tip. They even had a sign saying \"please do not tip\". Wonderful! They had free tasty snacks and decent music. The 45 minutes wait outside in the cold was not fun but all sorts of cheese and salami made up for it. The drinks that i got were so so."}
{"text":"Loved this place on a Thursday night. The vibe inside is awesome...hip but strangely cozy. Music was great. The drink specials are amazing and seem to run quite late into the evening. The fall Pear Sangria was incredible. Board games and giant Jenga make for a very fun night. This place definitely has something for everyone. On top of that, the people working there were incredibly nice and welcoming. No tips allowed, but if you drop a couple of extra they send it to a local charity that you can read about at the bar."}
{"text":"Very unique.. My best friend and I checked it out on Saturday night (90s) night and we had a great time.   The venue is small but don't let that fool you.. plenty of goodness in this place!!  It was crowded but not at the point where you couldn't move..  plenty of areas to sit and it was so fun to break it down on the dance floor..  to Nelly and all the great tunes from the 90s.  I love the specialty drink menu a lot of fun and different drinks to choose from.   The basement - where the restrooms are located..  clean.     The staff was friendly and it was a nice crowd late 30's and 40's .. ..  I will definitely be back again .. thanks Mixtape."}
{"text":"A nice place if you want good drinks and conversation. Definitely would recommend for something different and a well made cocktail. They also have a decent draft list which is seasonal. Even some of your regular domestic for anyone not wanting to go out of their comfort zone."}
{"text":"90s night all the way. Such good energy, good music, and good dancing. Creative drinks with 80s/90s-music inspired names were a fun perk as well. Again, 90s night is the best. I haven't been here on a non-90s night, but I imagine it would feel low-key, chill, and welcoming."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere and vibe of this place.  Several comfy seating options - table with chairs, sleek couches, oversized bean bags.    There were all sorts of games available for play, including a jumbo Jenga!  Operation is a little harder than I remember, but then again, I did have few cocktails!   All of the staff that I encountered we very helpful and friendly.  This is a no-tipping establishment, maybe that has something to do with it?!    It was happy hour when I went, it is from 7-9 PM.  My hubby got $2 off his beer.  I tried the drink special of the day which was a Blueberry Daquri for $5.  It was delicious!  I didn't order any food, but the bartender brought popcorn around to all the patrons which hit the spot.  I really enjoyed this place, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest places I've discovered in Pittsburgh! I actually have to give credit to a friend who asked: is there any coffee cocktail bar or board game bar? Lo and behold, using the power of Google, we happened upon this place: the coffee cocktail board game bar does exist! The vibe is so cool with modern furniture and bean bags placed throughout. The menu features multiple cocktails including those that happily marry coffee and alcohol. Even better, this restaurant provides fair wages and paid sick days to their employees so it's proudly a no-tipping business; the drink prices are scaled effectively.   I tried the Breakfast at Tiffany's which is a joyful blend of Irish cream, two types of liqueur, coffee, and whipped cream. My friend ordered the Mint Condition made of peppermint mocha syrup, Kahlua, coffee, whipped cream and dark chocolate espresso beans. There's a series of questions that your barista will ask you like: do you want it caffeinated or boozy? These questions help to personalize your drink, and it's all worth it. We both thought our drinks were delicious! The flavors in my drink just worked so well together; I'm pretty sure I saw fireworks with each sip. We sat down on a spacious sectional and played a game. It was such a fun, chill time I can't wait to return with more friends!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails!!! Amazing setup to this hidden gem! I found this place on instagram and we were visiting from Chicago! Love the decor love the bartenders and staff who have a great passion for cocktails!!! I wish they have this place in Chicago in my neighborhood! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I love Mixtape. Great atmosphere during the day and at night, from juice bar to dance night! I especially love their egg muffin and granola bowl. Organic ingredients and super reasonable prices. And the drinks on their dance nights are fabulous. Along with the music. Super happy to have them as our neighbors to the dance studio."}
{"text":"Dropped by late night on Saturday (they have $5 mimosas on Saturdays, and happy hours throughout the week!). This place is a cafe/bar, with a mountain of board games, fun music, and nice staff. You can go up to the bar where you order and pay for your drinks, and grab any seat you want. Getting to watch the bartender is definitely a plus! Flipping through their menu, it seemed like they serve their own creations, classics, and cafe-related cocktails, as well as some small bites and normal cafe drinks.   I got a mimosa to start off with, but I have to say their craft cocktails I ordered from their menu were way more mind-blowing. The It's Hip to Be Pear had a fun mix of tequila and fruit flavors with a whiff of cinnamon. Really interesting, and it actually went well together! Out of their cafe-inspired menu I tried a Hot Cocoa drink which was very sweet and warm. It might be a good choice for someone who doesn't enjoy very alcoholic-tasting drinks. The Bend... and (Ginger) Snap was a lighter cocktail with a prominent gingery taste.   Apart from the amazing drinks, I really appreciated the chill vibe of the bar. There are bean bags and couches as well as normal chairs and tables, and I felt very comfortable playing the board game I picked out with my friend. Perhaps because it was later in the night, I didn't have the problems some other reviewers seemed to have. Although we weren't the only ones there, the place definitely wasn't packed and I got my drinks pretty quickly. Would love to come back again!"}
{"text":"Mixtape was made for me...or at least it feels that way.  At first glance, it's just another storefront in Garfield, but once you walk in you are met with a gorgeous interior, complete with couches and tables with hidden chairs great for seating lots of 30-something butts.  And that's exactly the crowd to which Mixtape appeals. Sure, there were younger and older patrons present, but the general vibe is \"semi-mature partier.\"    Mixtape has also joined the ranks of Bar Marco in the tip-less world. Their employees are given a fair wage and benefits, so gratuities of any kind are gracious declined.  Bonus - their late night happy hour boasts $1 off a bevy of beverages and half-off premium well liquors. In short, I was drinking Pinnacle and Diet Cokes all night long and could not have been happier.  The DJ was perfect and I thoroughly enjoyed watching him bounce to the beat. He is one of those DJs who is clearly so happy in his element. Bull Dawgs food truck was outside throughout the evening, but ran out of a few key items, so I passed on the Dawgs. Maybe next time. There will definitely be a next time since Mixtape is totally rad."}
{"text":"Excellent service.   Unique cocktails.   Always something new to try.   They support local artists, food, and drinks.   It's obvious these ladies pour their heart and soul into this place.  Check it out!   Ps love the 80's music!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband and I come here often, not just in the evenings for the great drinks and atmosphere, but it's daytime cafe as well. The Pumpkin Smoothie is amazing! They are organic and locally sourced when possible. The owners are easy talkers and make for good hosts with pride in their city and support of local artists. A great place to meet up or hang out for sure!"}
{"text":"My friends and I love this place. It's certainly our number-one go-to spot for a chill night. I'd say the most striking characteristic of Mixtape is that their environment is highly conducive to meeting new people, mixing and mingling. I have met so many new and unique people at Mixtape versus other bars in Pittsburgh. It's a staple in the Pittsburgh bar portfolio simply because of that. There's also an abundance of Pittsburgh pride here--you can tell the decor screams \"we love it here, and we know you do too\". As far as drinks go, I've never had a bad drink here. I remember distinctly their mocha stout, which they sprinkled chocolate along the rim of the glass. It was such a treat.  They do get really busy sometimes though, and they actually do go from the bar to tables to deliver and take drink orders, but they've always been prompt with my orders. Also, all the bar staff are friendly--conversations are always plentiful and engaging. I do wish they published an event calendar on their website, because I remember stumbling upon theme or event nights before. Still, this place is great. If you live in Pittsburgh, you'll need to visit."}
{"text":"Nice spot. Came here when my friend was playing a set. Like that they don't accept tips at the bar. I had a chocolate porter which they rimmed with some sort of fabulous chocolate graham cracker dust. It was on special too so I drank like 4 of them. Also had a pretzel which was yummy. I was starving and asked if they had other food too, and they graciously offered to let me bring in pizza from next door. The pretzel ended up satisfying me but I appreciated how chill they were.   Nice atmosphere, lots of seating and neon lights. Hope this place ends up filling up more. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Yes! Mixtape was a great venue for a nonprofit fundraiser I attended. The space is cozy and fun at the same time and the staff was very friendly. Who could resist giant jenga, board games, and great music. They are a very inclusive and welcoming business and I very much appreciated the signage that stated that all were welcome! We arrived in time to put in a food order and had a surprisingly good panini and a soft pretzel. (I say surprisingly, solely based on the fact that their grill is behind the bar and that usually isn't a great sign... they did this right though!)  Another plus - they pay a livable wage to employees so all tips are donated to nonprofit fundraisers... that's a straight shot to my \"love it\" list!! Responsible business practices, inclusive atmosphere, good drinks, and yummy food... yeah, I'll be back!  The only downside is things take a bit longer than other places, given the craft cocktails. There ended up being a long line at the bar. When I go back, I'll certainly get the app for ordering and paying to make it easier on everyone!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the venue - beautiful chill spot with friendly staff, great drinks and live entertainment. Definitely a chill joint. Will frequent often."}
{"text":"5 stars for so many reasons. I've been in the service industry for a long time. This is the cleanest place I've seen. The cocktails are always changing and always fresh and house made. The staff is amazing and the owners always make sure everything is on point. I can't rave enough about this establishment."}
{"text":"What a fun place!   This place took me way back, and in a good way.   We stopped in early on a Friday night, just as they were changing over from an \"all are welcome\" sign to a \"21+\" sign. The place wasn't busy yet, but I can definitely see how it could get that way quick.    For atmosphere, it's a nice little setup, with a few tables and several lounge/conversation areas decked out with sofas, love sacs, and tape deck coffee tables.  Reminded me of those video game lounges that were popular for about a minute when I was a teenager.   The music mix was awesome.     There was no table service when we went, so we ordered at the bar.  The staff were all super-friendly.  They knew their cocktails and were able to make an adjustment around an ingredient I don't love.   Oh...and this is a no tipping place, which is a concept that I love.  They brought around a little boat of popcorn after a while, which was a nice touch.     Loved it and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great for groups/games and delicious, lovingly-crafted drinks. Bartenders are extremely friendly (and get paid a good wage according to the sign that asks you not to tip). They even had a fun little crafts station set up when I went during Christmastime."}
{"text":"Rarely do I give less than 4 stars to a business, but I got a really bad taste from this place. We were visiting Pittsburgh for the weekend and were looking forward to trying Mixtape after the great reviews. We came at 8:30pm on a Saturday and it seemed like they had a good concept going on... board games, funky cocktails, 90s music playing. It was pretty empty when we got there, but we got a round of drinks to pass the time. We decided to go to Nico's bar down the street to get some cheap drinks and pass the time with the plan of coming back to mixtape when it was more poppin. We went back to mixtape around 10:30 and we were told by the bouncer that they were at maximum capacity. There were maybe 45 people in there and the place looked empty. Max capacity was 99. We saw multiple tables inside that were unoccupied.  They refused a few other people while we were standing outside also.  I just can't even believe that they would turn away customers when their bar was not even close to full.  It didn't look much more exciting than when we first went in, so maybe we were spared in the end.   If you're looking for a good, affordable time, save the hassle and go to Nico' s recovery room down the street instead of coming here."}
{"text":"These people are working very hard to make this place work for everyone, I have to say.  This is rather refreshing in a fairly young business as this.  Without a doubt, hey do try to treat their customers pretty well.   As for the \"door people\", I still find a bit crass for my liking though.  It's hard for a customer entering angry, to enjoy themselves and relax. Still something about the bar setup is confusing and unorganized.  It seems like the star of this place, wants to be the cocktails.  I don't think this is happening here.  If they had a someone who I feel, wasn't trying to single-handedly reinvent Mixology as we know it, that would help.  But I'm going to keep going back. Because something they are doing is still fresh and changing.  -S"}
{"text":"Came here last night for 90's night! It was my first time and I was really excited to check out a new place in Garfield. I'm looking forward to more things popping up in that area!! Mixtape is a smaller space with a lounge area, dance floor/DJ and a bar in the back. They have local art and overall it had a great vibe. The set up was a bit confusing with the bar in the back and lounge up front but I think I would like it more on a less busy night. They had a lot of interesting craft cocktails, but I stuck with the basics, as it was busy and I was a bit impatient. I'd love to see them do more events there, but maybe be a bit more organized in anticipation of a large crowd.  They don't accept tips here! So naturally drinks are a bit pricier but it all evens out. In fact, sometimes after a few I can be a bit too generous so it could even help me out. My favorite part is that if you do tip in cash, they donate the money to charity! Amazing! What a cool work environment. And although they were a bit scrambled at times, the staff were all super nice and helpful. I'd definitely come back--and bring cash!"}
{"text":"I received a recommendation, from a friend, to stop in this spot while I was in Pittsburgh for work and I'm so glad I did. What a great concept! I loved this option as a spot for free wifi, coffee and/or craft cocktails, and a great environment for productivity. The staff I encounter was super friendly and made an awesome cocktail for me to enjoy while cranking out a few emails. I chose the signature \"Hot and Dangerous\" cocktail because I tend to enjoy spice to my drink - great choice on the signature list! I had such a positive first visit, I'm excited to stop back in to try something else the next time I'm in town for work!"}
{"text":"Let me qualify my review by saying that we really only interacted with the hostess, but that was enough never to return. My boyfriend and I were meeting friends there this evening but the establishment was \"at capacity\" when we arrived (read: there were 19 people inside). Small crowd to cap at, but rules are rules, understandable. I had a dead cell and wanted to wish my friend a happy birthday before bailing, but alas, the hostess was unwilling to let me inside to convey that message, even with my boyfriend offered up as collateral. Eventually a friend from inside offered to swap places with me so I could pass my message along, and even so, the hostess insisted on confiscating my ID until I returned, I'm guessing for fear that I would disappear into the masses, leaving my friend to huddle in the cold rain in my place? It was pretty insulting, not to mention presumptuous. I've lived in Pittsburgh long enough to expect a kind of laid back civility from the staff at places I patronize, and there are enough bars (or in this case, glorified coffee shops?) that I don't need to frequent an establishment that lacks it."}
{"text":"90's night! The Dj does take requests and she had all the songs I requested. Cute lounge with great drinks. The bartenders don't keep tips instead they donate them to a featured nonprofit. Pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Mixtape is the best! I couldn't say enough great things about this place. I've been 10+ times since they opened and always suggest to my friends as a place to meet for a Happy Hour during the week. Currently, they have $2 off seasonal beers and $2 off signature cocktails. My opinion is that the cocktails are the better deal. ;) You can get beer anywhere, but the cocktails at Mixtape are the reason I keep returning. Well, that and I asked for a Beyonce-themed cocktail and they delivered! The bartenders are always so pleasant and careful to get your order just right. They also make an actual living wage, which means if you chose to tip, it goes to a local organization.   One of my friends described his cocktail as a \"mouth orgasm\" -- so there's also that.   The atmosphere is very chill any night during the week, especially on Wednesday game nights. During the weekends, it tends to get pretty packed.   Pro tip: order a Spak Brothers pizza on the way and you can bring it inside."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to check out Mixtape last night! What a great bar! As a music nerd, I loved the theming and the creativity the owners put into the place, down to even the names of the drinks. We enjoyed the cocktails, the free popcorn, and playing board games while listening to a great mix of music. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A new place that doesn't have it's feet yet.   THE GOODS:  * Cool décor. * Intimate space, created from the deep row house architecture. Tables, lounge areas, etc. are near the dance area. (Oh, wait. Is there a dance area? In effect, you dance wherever.) * Diverse menu with different items. * Friendly staff. They add to the warmth of the place with their smiles and willingness to chat a bit. * The music. I liked what I heard when I was there. Danceable and yet not intrusive if you are chilling with friends in the lounge area. Not sure if the music is always this way.  THE BADS: * The service. They are so busy being friendly, you can forget service. I went in twice when they were slow (maybe 10 people in the place) and eventually left each time without being served. The second time I even pointedly said to the (apparent) server, \"I want to be served by you.\" Sure!\" she responded, and I ended up with menus. 20 minutes later, no one had come to take the order.  * Drinks and food looked good by menu descriptions, but I can't tell you whether they were any good.  See point above. * If you want a discreet space for chatting with friends, forget it if there is dancing or a crowd. What can be intimate (the whole place as dance) can also be off-putting if you are looking to lounge. * The \"LOVE\" sign. It's a good fit artistically for the place, but too bright. At night it shines on the front third of the place like a spotlight. I'd suggest lower wattage bulbs that create a glow.  THE CONCLUSION: Two times with no service, a month into operations? There are lots of other places to check out. Maybe I'll check in again in a year."}
{"text":"I went to Mixtape recently after a Capoeira practice with a few of my fellow students. It's a nice and quiet place with a mixture of couches and more standard tables, as well as a bar area. The cocktails were delicious, and fairly affordable, clocking in around $5-7 each. On top of that, when I attempted to leave the remainder of my bill as a tip, I was informed that the bartenders do not take tips, as the owner pays them a living wage with health benefits. They will accept the money, but they then donate it to charitable causes."}
{"text":"There aren't enough good things to say about Mixtape. Not only do they offer quality vegan and veg bites, but their cocktails are creative and always lovely to drink AND look at.  The environment is what I appreciate most about it though. They're very relaxed about people coming in to just chill. I often play boardgames here with a bite or sip of something. It's a great venue for local sounds too.   I'm excited to see how Mixtape evolves and continues to offer quality chill space! If you haven't been, go now."}
{"text":"What a fun place to come to for a late night, ok it was 9:30, drink. Again making our way down Penn Ave because of First Fridays and Mixtape was a place we did not want to miss. The idea is cool. A bar that does coffee and board games. Sounds fun, right? They also do not allow tipping for their staff, but if you do tip it goes to a charity that they have listed on the bar. Pretty amazing right?  When we were there it was packed, but by the time we ordered our drinks we were able to find a seat on the beanbags that faced the makeshift stage. It was a perfect place to enjoy a cocktail and to listen to some music. I would like to come back to try their coffee! But the drink that I had was pretty delicious, so I was not disappointed.   ALSO, if you download the SRVD app you get a free Dos Equis on a daily basis. You can also order you drink from the app so you do not have to wait in line. I downloaded the app, and if you use my code ADELM752 you will get a $5 credit!! I referred my friend to the app in the bar and we both got a $5 credit! I had never even hear about that. Super interesting and neat!!  The art on the wall was also really beautiful. There were a few pieces that I would love to have hanging in my house. I was impressed by the art in the place because it was neat and unusual but also mixed so well with the decor.   The staff was also super nice. We were asking questions and being indecisive and our bartender was so nice. I don't care if he was growling in his head, he was just a really nice guy to work with and answered everything we needed to know. He made our decision on drinks easier.   Ok so then the drink.  Blind Melon: Faber craft gin, lillet, soda water, and fresh basil over house made basil-melon ice cubes. Yum! I will say that this drink was a bit heavy. As in, the basil was powerful and heavy in the tummy. Very fresh, very good, but it left me full.   Yes, I only had one. I mean it was 9:30! Yeah, I am a bit of a grandma, and not a cool one, a grumpy want to be in bed early one. But it was great. I was able to sit down, drink my well made cocktail and listen to some live music. It was a perfect end to my Friday and a great way to start my weekend.   I urge everyone to try them out!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a Friday evening with some friends and stayed for several hours.  I ordered their Ginger Spice mocktail.  What's Hot - Menu variety.  They have their own in-house created cocktails, traditional cocktails, beers, and mocktails (nonalcoholic drinks).  There's a small food menu, popcorn, and a little water cooler.   - Quality.  Their ginger spice mocktail was delicious.  There's even a splash of cinnamon on the top of my mocktail.  Their drinks, including mocktails, are clever and well put together. - You can bring your own food!  They have a policy that allows customers to bring their own food, which is really rare, but hella cool.  For example, we started with a group of 5 and then became a group of 9.  We ordered 2 rounds of pizza, which came out to 4 pizzas total.  The staff were accommodating and gave us paper plates and napkins.  When we finished our pizzas, they cleared away our trash, including the takeout boxes for the pizza.   - Service.  Their staff is excellent.  Nice and helpful.  They offer free popcorn and there's a small water cooler, by the bar, where you can get cups of water.  I like being able to get my own water, rather than having to always get it from the staff.  Additionally, the staff bring around and offer plates of free popcorn to their customers, which is awesome.  - Price.  I arrived at their happy hour time, which begins at 6pm.  My mocktail's original price is $6, but I was charged $4 (and some change).   - No tipping.  It's rare to find a shop that has a no tipping policy.  This place pays their staff a decent/living wage (I was told $15/hr), so they do not ask their customers to tip their staff.  I'm impressed.  Common sense and a good policy where the staff don't have to rely on tips.       Observation - Space.  It's not a bad layout and this is a decent space.  However, be aware that this place can get busy fast, which means it can be easy to run out of room.  Depends on when you come here.      Final Answer Definitely recommend the place and would come again."}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of this place!!! If you love the 90s (who doesn't), bean bag chairs, board games, creative drinks, delicious beer, and awesome staff this is your place! GAH! It's so comfy and inviting. They often work with local non profits, too, which is amazing.   The first time I went there I thought I died and went to heaven! 90s music and even 90s commercials being projected on the wall! Fantastic. It hasn't been overly crowded the two times I have been there. Which is good for me, I just don't think enough people have discovered this hidden gem yet. So I'm going to only share this with you guys for now! ;)   The prices were great as well. The last trip I got a Weyerbacher IPA (they donate some of their proceeds to animal charities) and a vegan cookie (less than $10)! YUM.  This place is tip free, they pay their staff wages, so that's pretty cool, too.   They also serve Zeke's coffee, which I discovered through a Yelp event and promptly fell in love with.   If you love the 90s you will love this place, no doubt in my mind! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great drinks. Great food. Great service. Great people. Mixtape is a gem in an up-and-coming neighborhood. I've gone there to work in the afternoon and to get a drink in the evening. The options for vegetarians and vegans are amazing. But it's the smoothies and drinks that keep me coming back for more. I love the names. I love the flavors. I love the vibe. Thank you, Mixtape!!"}
{"text":"Overall, Mixtape has a great vibe and I love that there is a decent bar and hangout place in the neighborhood. The decor is awesome, the furniture is comfortable and not overcrowded. It is definitely warm and inviting. They sometimes just hand you some free popcorn. Why not? I also like that they have a no-tipping policy.  Unfortunately, I'm just not crazy about their cocktails. They simply don't compare to many of the other amazing offerings in Pittsburgh. They're definitely trying and have *some* of the right ideas, but then often fail in some major way.  Example: Manhattan Flame Hennessy cherries - presumably pre-soaked. They spray them, ignite them in a glass, it is quite a spectacle. Take a decent rye and good vermouth. Carefully stirred to chill - pretty standard cocktail, right? And then.... DUMPED OVER CRUSHED ICE & SERVED?! What? They took all of those nice bold flavors and watered them way down, and it just tastes like a terrible, weak drink. Then you try the cherry, and its not a house-made liquor-soaked cherry, but a waxy, red food-colored in high-fructose-corn-syrup cherry and it just tastes awful.  Almost all of the drinks follow this pattern: Take some awesome ingredient and time consuming, complex preparation ideas, but then mess up the ratio or water them down way, way too much. There just aren't booze-forward drinks here where the liquor is allowed to shine. Most things are served with crushed ice, sparkling water, or some sweet soda or juice. While I appreciate that this is often what some people want, it compromises almost the entire menu and is not very diverse.  However, the Set Fire To Rain is actually delicious as-is. It was the only delicious drink we got out of 4.  I really hope they either revamp the drink menu, or at least add to it for some less entry-level concoctions."}
{"text":"DJ/Dance Floor and more! Themed nights. Drinks-alcoholic and non. Excellent cocktail menu and scrumptious glass rimming."}
{"text":"There are so many things to love about this place:  -They allow outside food if you're a paying customer, so we brought our Spak Bros. meal in and they even offered to give us plates and silverware!   -Their happy hour started at 7pm on Monday and the drinks were only $6.50 - $7. Given the quality of the drinks, that's a steal.  -Once happy hour starts, they give you a tray of free popcorn!  -This is a no-tip establishment, meaning that they actually pay their employees enough!  -The interior is lovely, with ample seating, plenty of natural light at the front, with a softer light in the back.  -The drinks are innovative (some with infused coffee) and delicious. One reviewer called their drinks watery, but I'd actually call them well-mixed, meaning that you're not getting punched in the face by the alcohol, but you can still taste it.  -The bartenders were very friendly and inviting.  -Coffee, booze, AND board games!  If you haven't checked this place out yet, I highly recommend going on a random weeknight, when it's not packed."}
{"text":"Great spot for drinks! I love how they are a no-tips establishment. The menu prices include both tax and gratuity so you pay what you see. They have a nice happy hour from 5-7: $2 off signature cocktails, which leaves you with upscale drinks for a cool $7 (including tip!)  On a Thursday evening we had no trouble finding seats and helping ourselves to the pleasant supply of board games. Our night included Exploding Kittens and several rounds of foosball - it's been a awhile since I've been somewhere with a table! They also had Bring It On playing on a projector, quite the throwback   To drink I had the Thyme After Thyme, a gin based cocktail. It was good but not quite as refreshing as I expected and not particularly strong. Still a great deal for $7 but next time I would order something else  The bartenders were are very friendly. I will definitely be back!"}
