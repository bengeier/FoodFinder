{"text":"This is a terrible place to eat.  The owner's brother runs the cash register and will look right at you when you come in and not say a word or even smile.  In fact, he has a frown on his face all the time.  They don't appreciate the business and don't even ask how everything was or thank you for coming. The owner, Chris, walks around and doesn't even talk to the people.  We went a few times, but the food was so awful and the servers very unprofessional.  I never has one thing that was good.  The menu is so big including all the specials that they should scale down and learn to cook a few good things good and hire a REAL CHEF!  The hostess doesn't smile and dresses with a see thru top with her red bra straps showing.  How unprofessional!!!  We will never, ever set food in Jimmie's Restaurant again!!!"}
{"text":"Still love the food but the blond waitresses are kinda tactless. My husband likes flirting too but me- not too much."}
{"text":"Wednesday's specials include Chicken Pot Pie, comfort food at its best!!! With your choice of two sides, that comes with it, you'd be hard pressed to clean your plate!! For $6.99, Jimmies still and will always be the best value in Mint Hill!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is OK here but other meals are pretty lame, typical cheap diner fare. I guess its a decent value for the money, works if you  are nearby and simply need to eat something but I certainly wouldn't make this a destination. Servers are friendly enough but food is just uninspiring"}
{"text":"This is a Resturant inspector dream!!!!!!!!! The star is for me for even going into this squaller"}
{"text":"I come here for the fried chicken on Sunday's, which is excellent by the way. Today I ordered the grilled chicken breast with yams. I love their yams so good! The wings and soups are also good! It's a real family style restaurant, everyone's friendly and you feel at home."}
{"text":"Jimmie's is your typical Greek/American restaurant with a standard menu, daily specials, and 4-5 actual specials placed on the board.  The restaurant is larger than most restaurants of this nature, and provides a variety of seating choices: tables, booths, and even a party room.  There is plenty of parking and access is easy.  The food is consistent and usually good.  Service depends on the waitress you get, but all are average or above.  These ladies work in a busy high volume restaurant, so I cut them some slack.  They do get busy at times and serve a variety of clients, from the hard working blue collar guy to the occasional celebrity (no I'm not talking about myself).  The place also has a good display of desserts - both a positive and a negative, mostly a negative right now for me as I am trying to lose a few pounds.  If you have not eaten here, give this place a try, and if you see Jimmie - tell him Eddie sent you by his way!"}
{"text":"Used to be a great place to eat and now its gone down hill bad. I've lived in the area for 2 years now but while visiting family I've been going for about 6 years. They seem to employ anyone that says they are a cook now as I've been told the original cook that was there when I moved down left, the food is extremely inconsistent now and so is the service. Their are a select few servers that are great but it doesn't really make up for what you get to eat. 

I'm writing this review because this will be the last time I eat here. I went to dinner with my parents and usually I will pass up eating here unless its breakfast but I decided to go with. We were seated in a pretty bad spot a door way, who wants to sit in a doorway? So as usual our order is taken and pretty uncomplicated, 1 BLT, 1 Club sandwich, 1 Cheese burger and an order of fried pickles. we get our drinks and a few minutes later we get our pickles. After we finish our appetizer we noticed that 2 families that came in 10-15 mins behind us get their food first and each of the 2 tables didn't get their food at the same time so there was about 5 minutes between each. Finally our server tells us our food is coming, Really? 5 minutes later we finally get our food everything is alright except no Club, at this point I didn't want to wait any longer so I just ate the BLT I was served. I did enjoy the 3 pieces of bacon and the whole tomato(I'm not kidding it was literally an entire tomato sliced onto this sandwich) I was served.

There are plenty of other restaurants in the same shopping area I'd recommend eating there and if all else fails a Publix is located across the street. 

Farewell Jimmies you were once great."}
{"text":"No Star at all Went for Breakfast this morning got coffee and the waitress took our order an Hour later still no food asked the Waitress how much longer She replied she didn't take our order Service at this place is absolutely the worse I've come across!!!! Will not be back, rather pay more elsewhere and get better service then none at all"}
{"text":"Great place to go for home cooked meals. They always have awesome complimentary soup before your meal. If you go, be sure to ask for Lisa to wait on you. She is the best server they have!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. I do enjoy their country style steak. But it's only available certain nights. The past few times we have been we have had this waitress that just made the whole experience  awful. She makes fun of anything we say or do. She does it so loud that other customers stare. She rushes us to order and then rushes us out the door when we are done. She may think she's joking/funny but she's very rude and embarrassing. Won't be returning for a while that's for sure"}
{"text":"Jimme's seems to be a staple in the Mint Hill area and as far as their food and service goes it is decent across the board. I usually hit this place up for breakfast if I ever do make it over but nothing has jumped out at me as good or bad either way. Can't really think of anything to say more than \"ehh\" /shrug"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick business lunch last week, and unfortunately the quick part was missing and the food, when it came wasn't worth the wait. I ordered the meatloaf, which seemed popular with all the ordered I was overhearing. Came with 2 sides and a up of soup. Soup was veggie and was pretty good, but the meatloaf was not that good. Lacked flavor and the \"gravy\" was all Ketchup...eh. The mac and cheese was average. The downer though was the service...our server just seemed off and not happy. Oh well...hope she cheered up. A one time stop for me."}
{"text":"My Wife & I have been going to Jimmie's for four years.

If you're looking for solid diner food, Jimmie's can't be beat: good food, great prices, friendly and efficient servers, and spotlessly clean.  If you're looking for a fine restaurant, go elsewhere.  But if you're looking for consistently good diner food, Jimmie's is it."}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice now...once for lunch and once for dinner and I don't think I'll go back. The best part of lunch was our waitress. She was personable and just nice, which goes a long, long way for me.  The food was just ok. I got the Ruben and my husband got the chicken and dumplings. 

We went back for breakfast on a Sunday. I'm all about the hash browns, which weren't all that good. I'm not a big fan of paying for something I can make better at home, and those fell into that category. I got the Spanish omelette and it was a hair undercooked.  My husband got the western omelette and it was plain tasting."}
{"text":"Large and cheerful restaurant, outside looks like it had been an Applebees in a past life. Greeted warmly by hostess and brought to table quickly. Booth was comfortable and also sparkly clean. The meals were all quite reasonable, I had the turkey with dressing. It came with gravy, cranberry sauce and choice of two sides. I opted for a salad and fried squash. The lettuce on the salad was wet and it made the dressing run, so I wasn't very happy with the salad. The fried squash was so good. It was lightly fried with very little breadcrumbs, the flavor was just superb. The turkey, gravy, cranberry sauce was all very good, the stand out was the dressing. What a wonderful surprise when I got to it under the turkey. It was like a hidden prize. I do not know what was in it, but it was just the right amount of spices, vegetables, and breadcrumbs. I would certainly return and get this dinner again. The service was also excellent. Hubby had pork, it looks yummy and he cleaned his plate. Other friends had something Italian which came with garlic bread.  Great job Jimmie's."}
{"text":"I pitty any person that believes this place serves a decent breakfast.  I have had breakfast here 3x and EVERY time I get COLD toast that had to be sitting out for at least 10 minutes.  My eggs are never warmer than room temperature.  The grits come up already half hardened and the omlettes....all it is is eggs with stuff in it, they do absolutely nothing special to them.  

I'm not a chef and any breakfast I cook in 10 min is far better than anything I have had at this dive.  

Bottom line:  places like this are only in business bc it is a family establishment and bc some people are too foolish to try a new place that serves decent food."}
{"text":"1.  Try the Cajun Whitefish...delicious
2.  Fried apple sticks...delicious
3.  Buffalo wings...delicious
4.  Tartar sauce is awesome


The one complaint, the salads always seem watery.

Get Jimmy's a try, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Do not eat at this Restaurant, horrible service I ordered ahead of those couple who just sat down and they got their order before me.  I waited 25 mins. They discriminate. I left and complaint at the guy who's at the cashier who doesn't care."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch after doing some Christmas shopping. Got the Chicken Souvlaki Platter. It was delicious. The Marinated Chicken was tender and cooked perfectly.  Nice portion of chicken sitting inside of a pita bread that had a toothpick in it to shape it like a bowl. Dressing was great. The salad was awesome, tziaziki sauce was on point. Deserae was my server. She did an outstanding job. Friendly and professional. I felt comfortable and not rushed. I tend to eat slow and enjoy my food. I would recommend this restaurant highly especially if you enjoy Greek cooking. The menu looks great for any taste bud. Lots of choices. All the plates that I saw going by me looked delicious as well. One plate had delicious looking gravy over Fried Chicken. Mmmmm.....When I'm in this part of town and need great food, great service in a clean and friendly establishment. You'll find me here.  2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"So this review will be straight to the point . This is a family owned business that is well deserving of the five stars . We came in not expecting much on a Friday night but walked out full and happy. Upon entry we were treated like old family friends , greeted and, seated dinner was served and my oh my it was great. Service again was spectacular and all I can say is for the price we will be back again."}
{"text":"Experience wasn't that great. Steak tasted cheap and service was iffy. I'm guessing this place is better known for Breakfast? 

Honestly, I would rather go to Chili's, less expensive and better food quality. 

Pros:
- Cornbread
- Sweet Tea
- Free lollipops at the front"}
{"text":"We've been going to Jimmy's for many years. It is a American Family style restaurant. Not fancy or pretentious. But the food & service is solid. Home cooking done proper at an affordable price. The complimentary Split Pea soup though visually unappealing was made fresh & delicious. Grilled pork chops were seasoned & cooked perfectly. This home cooking is elevated."}
{"text":"I don't know how this restaurant stays in business I've eaten there for breakfast and dinner and they both were very bland. Breakfast is better because it's a simpler meal but dinner was a disaster. They brought me the wrong food twice and when I finally got my food it was just okay."}
{"text":"There are two types of successful restaurants in this modern era-  the first are the places that understand the need to deliver superior service and food, these places embrace yelp and the like, knowing it's a great way to attract new customers.  The other are the long established places that were around long before yelp or any consumer based review and feedback technology.  These types of places trade in past glory and the simple principal that most older  people are not willing to break their routine and try the unknown.  

Jimmys is the later.  Having been long established in the area,  their average customer age is ancient.  These people keep a place like this in business long after the owners have given up on trying to be better.  Very cheap daily specials and senior discounts keep them coming in regardless of quality and service.  

No one accustomed to receiving a modern quality restaurant experience will be satisfied here.  Read the other reviews for details.  To the manager who just stands at the cash register all night rather than actually managing the restaurant/. Do us all a favor and please stop asking 'how dinner was' -  if you actually cared to know you would be on the floor managing and interacting with your customers."}
{"text":"Jimmies restaurant is a good place to get down home comfort food, the menu offers a little bit of everything including daily specials. (They are closed on Monday) I ordered the meatloaf and mushrooms gravy when it arrived it was covered in red sauce that was spicy which should be written on the menu however they did replace it for me but I did have to pay for the new dinner which is fine I guess I just think more customer friendly place would have comped my meal since I had to wait for ever for my meal to come. 


They do have very good fried chicken which is on special on Saturday along with pretty good country style steak, and the mac and cheese is yum. Their side salad is lettuce and tomatoes nothing special however their dressing is house made and tasty. The service is hit or miss depending on who you get and how busy they are. Overall it's good!"}
{"text":"This is your quintessential family style restaurant. Which is fine. :) I too have mainly been here for breakfast only but can assure the lunch and dinner is just as satisfactory. The prices are very reasonable here. The food matches the price I would say. Friendly staff and clean place. Diner style menu with not a whole lot of pizzazz. Plenty of space and accommodations for any size group. Try the Irish Benedict. Mmmmm."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast.  It is just OK.  The waitress asked my husband if he wanted his bacon crispy, doesn't everyone? And it was not crispy.  Good service."}
{"text":"This is close to the worst food I have ever eaten. Don't waste your time. The manager didn't even ask me or my partner how our meal was when we were paying."}
{"text":"The food was really good. I got the Irish Pub Fish sandwich special. Service was a little slow as it was really busy. They had a party of some kind in the room behind me and the music was too loud. I will go back, hopefully when less busy"}
{"text":"This may sound a little wacky but you can disregard my review for this for this long-running, family owned Greek restaurant if you'd like. Instead, one only has to note that their parking lot was completely full from the time we arrived at 10:45 a.m. to the time we left at noon on a Monday? The locals obviously love this place!

For what it's worth; however, here's my review... I elected to go with my old standby the chicken parm. It was a daily special and was served with a small salad and garlic bread for around $9. Their house made red sauce is very sweet but still tasty. The portion size was a bit smaller than other Greek restaurants I have reviewed. There was nothing special about the salad and the garlic bread was good but a bit greasy.

My friend was very excited about his chicken pot pie, fried okra and 3 bean salad. The pot pie was loaded with large chucks of chicken and the okra was fried perfectly.

The sanitary rating was an impressive 98 and the atmosphere very appealing. Service was fair. Overall, it was a little better than average; yet again, the full parking lot suggests its regulars think more highly. Although not a Gotta Try, I suggest giving it a try and deciding for yourself."}
{"text":"Great diner food, reliable daily specials, great staff and no rush atmosphere make Jimmie's the place to eat in Mint Hill.  Closed Mondays."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the breakfasts here but dinner can be spotty and after tonight, I won't be back.

My son and I found the original booth we were seated in to be uncomfortable; one bench too close to the table and one too far away and nothing was adjustable. I asked the hostess for another booth and she gave us one, but only after trying to convince us to stay where we were. Quite rude about it, even though there were other booths and tables available.

We ordered mozzarella sticks for an appetizer, my son got the chicken fingers and I got the nightly meatloaf special. The sticks were delivered by someone other than our waitress, who had a large serving tray with everything else going to the table behind us; she dropped down our plate of cheese sticks without a single word to us, just set it on the table and left. I find this to be unbelievably rude. Even just a simple 'enjoy!' or 'here you go' is fine.

I had to have someone send my waitress over so I could ask her if I was getting the soup and bread basket that are included with every special. She said, 'yeah, you can have the soup...it's vegetable; we don't bring out the soup and bread basket unless you ask because we don't want to waste it.'

WTF? I'm PAYING for that in the price of my dinner! Don't tell me you're not bringing it out because I didn't request it!

So you guessed it, she brought the soup and bread with the dinner, so of course, I didn't eat the soup. And it got wasted.  

Which didn't really matter, because it wasn't hot anyway. In fact, the only thing that was hot were the mozzarella sticks. Everything else was at best lukewarm.

When I left, the guy at the register asked how was dinner, so I said 'mediocre' and told him what had happened. (I had pre-warned my son that I would, so he was waiting outside!) He said the waitress shouldn't have said the soup and bread came only if you asked; that if you order the special you got them automatically. I handed him my cash, which was the exact amount and turned to go. He offered me my money back, but I didn't take it, because that wasn't the point.

The point was...your restaurant is falling apart. Rude service, sub-par food, and you're cheating your customers who pay for soup and bread but don't receive them. I hope you will take my comments to heart. 

That was the point."}
{"text":"Great place for a hearty breakfast! Coffee is really good, strong. Biscuits fresh and light. The home fried potatoes are excellent. My eggs and steak cooked to perfection. I will definitely be back and can't wait to try some of their specialty omlets."}
{"text":"Food is delicious!! Atmosphere is fun and casual. The restaurant staff is very friendly and helpful. You can tell it is a hotspot for locals and out-of-towners alike! They even feature southern food that can only be found in the Carolinas. My pancakes were so good I didn't even touch the syrup."}
{"text":"We always enjoy breakfast here.  The service is always top notch and we love the omelets.  Breakfast is very busy on weekends but you can call ahead and get your name on the list.  Attention:  Breakfast ENDS weekdays PROMPTLY at 11:00am.  PROMPTLY at noon on the weekends.

Lunch is good too.  Try the chicken salad on croissant with the homemade potato chips.  Yum.

Skip the dinner menu, ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzz......
Especially skip the deserts which seem to me, to have sat in the rotating glass display case for days on end."}
{"text":"First time to eat here... WILL NEVER BE BACK. The seating took way longer than the 30min. The extremely rude hostess quoted us.
Didn't bother looking at us at any point.
She has bad reviews here and I had hoped that it was just an every once in a while thing but no. At the end of our meal I saw a gentleman who was asking people how they enjoyed their meal. But he did not ask us since I'm sure he could tell it hadn't been a good experience. 
Now to the most important thing, the food. We ordered breakfast and our food all arrived at different times.
With some people eating while others waited.just plain mediocre food. No utensils were given. We had to ask 3 servers who all ignored us and the rude hostess. Nothing special about this place, unless you count horrible service and plain food."}
{"text":"This restaurant holds nothing special but it's still a decent option for a family restaurant.  Their food is perfectly average but the service is excellent.  The waiters are nice, friendly, and provide excellent customer service.  The price is worth the quality of food given."}
{"text":"Food is fair. I've been there several times and the food is always cold. I realize I could have it reheated, but after the third visit my breakfast was still served cold. Too many other places to choose from with better food."}
{"text":"It may be a hit or miss situation here. Had breakfast with my daughter this morning. The Irish Benedict was amazing! My daughter got sausage gravy biscuits....yum! The home fries....not so much. Cold, dry, hard, bland. 
Wouldn't be opposed to giving it another go! Nice people!"}
{"text":"I'm not very impressed with this restaurant. There are some positives, but most are negative. I believe my family will drive further in Charlotte to get our \"diner\" fix.
 
Pros:
Reuben is decent. It has a good taste, but my bread was completely soggy. Pickles tasted very old, and veggie casserole was okay- at best. 

My husband had some Cajun fish that he loved. He said it was great. 

Cons: 
Service! Service is everything when your working in the restaurant business. My husband went to pick our order up- as we had called ahead. When my husband arrived they had already given our order to someone else. The server simply said, \" someone's already picked that up\" we had to get management involved. They made our food again. They didn't offer us any discount for the mix up or the long(ER) wait. 10% off would suffice- anything would have been a good gesture. 

Salad- the salads are very watery. I don't know if it's the ranch dressing, but it's not very good. Also I asked my salad to be prepared with mixed greens. They assured me the salad came with mixed greens. I ordered the chicken salad. It came with 4 very small pieces of grilled chicken and iceberg lettuce. Not very good 

Veggie ( in my case broccoli) casserole- the taste was bland. Just tasted like broccoli with some cheese.   


Overall we will no longer be going to this restaurant. Such a shame because we love right around the corner!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the extremes of experiences at Jimmie's. Perhaps it's unavoidable in a restaurant open 17 hours a day.  I give it 5 stars not because I compare it to the Four Seasons, but because it does a great job in doing what it does; knowing what it is. I've been there a dozen times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and the food is ok. Nothing really special whether you order breakfast or lunch. It's typical diner food and a typical diner atmosphere. Service is good and prices are diner prices. Living in NY most of my life it's nice to have diner food every once and a while. I wouldnt drive several miles out of my way to come here though. If you live in the neighborhood though give it a try after church or one Sunday for breakfast with the family"}
{"text":"Diner food, avg age is 70 years old +. You can eat healthy there, or very unhealthy. Debated whether to give 3 or 4 stars but settled on 3 mainly bc the service is below avg."}
{"text":"Had the most disgusting meatloaf. They said it was in mushroom gravy but it was this kind of sweet and really salty goo. Definitely would not order it again."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Mint Hill, the wife and I are there every Sunday. Good people, good food."}
{"text":"Poor service. We had to inform the waiter that he forgot my side item after he forgot to mention the complimentary soup that came with the meal.  He didn't follow up after delivery, didn't refill our drinks, didn't deliver the bread with our meal !!! Their food however was fair. The Alaska Whitefish was spicy, a little salty but enjoyable. Green beans delicious, the mashed potatoes were creamy and smooth. Their fries were average. The broccoli was tender but bland."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, always with the same experience and always leave saying \"I don't think we'll come back here.\" So the last time I was here I asked \"Didn't I say I wasn't coming back here?\" Then I was reminded why I say that every time. 

The menu contains pretty typical American food. Prices are fine. Food is fine. The service is hit or miss. We are usually greeted (if that is what you can call it) by a young and not so happy to be there hostess, and then after a good wait, we get sat. Service is slow, but for the most part the waitresses have been kind enough. We usually wait a long time for the waitress to take our order, then wait a long time for the mediocre food, then wait a long time for the check. Then wait at the check-out counter for somebody to acknowledge us. The atmosphere leaves you with a sense of nobody really cares, and nobody has any pride in the place. I know this place gets busy and the staff is stretched, but I feel that something, anything should be GOOD. But it is just...fine, I suppose. After writing this review I will remember my words \"I don't think I will be back.\""}
{"text":"I'm going to update my opinion on Jimmie's, after having been there a couple more times.  On some weekend days - perhaps Sundays - they are the only place open if you want breakfast.  That gives them a leg up.

The problem is that their service really needs work, which cuts that leg off again.  If Jimmie - or whoever serves in Jimmie's stead if he is not around any longer - would take that advantage and run with it, then they would indeed be a great place to go, rather than just the only place to go.

They still have a good selection.  In fact, they have too much of a selection most days.  But if you go on Sundays, they have a shortened menu (I guess everyone wants to leave early so they only do certain things), and that menu does a better job all around.  But the service still stinks most of the time."}
{"text":"Great local joint with wide variety, great quality, and reasonable prices. The BBQ chicken lunch I had was great and included two vegetables (my choices: mashed potatoes and green beans) plus a cup of the soup of the day (today: vegetable soup) for only $6.75. Most entrees are less than $10. Portions are what I'd expect from a sit-down restaurant like this (comparable to Applebee's or O'Charley's portion sizes). Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The best eating anywhere always top shelf with great food great service and great prices . Just got done with another fantastic country steak dinner the soup of the day today is lentil which is the best lentil soup I have ever had which after 40 years and 44 states and 6 provinces of Canada  traveled  and a lot of meals I say it is the best. My wife  had the shrimp plate which was also spot on. Jimmies Rocks"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times for business gatherings and a couple times with the family. Breakfast on Sunday mornings have been my best experiences. The dinners are ok. There is nothing bad but nothing stands out as great! We stopped in for dinner last night, my wife had the baked chicken and stuffing. The chicken was moist and tasty but we couldn't figure out why the stuffing was sweet. This place goes down as my \"in a pinch\" stop."}
{"text":"Here 7/1/12

Had the bacon and eggs and it was delicioso! Will return here many times. Good food, service, and prices!"}
{"text":"This is another place I have been coming to for years and never reviewed.  Their breakfast is great (get the French Toast), lunch is good, (burgers, sandwiches, homemade chips) dinner is \"meh,\" (typical diner fare).  Not sure why there are so many complaints about the service.  I have had servers who were not as good as others, but never had any to complain about.  The one complaint I do have tho,  doesn't have anything to do with the wait staff, but with the restaurant itself.  Do you really need to be so Gestapo about ending breakfast at 11 / 12 weekdays / weekends? I have had servers literally run back to the kitchen with my breakfast order to beat the 11:59:59 weekend deadline.  I have also been in line at 11:30, seated at 11:55 (Sundays are VERY busy) and because my order didn't make it to the kitchen before the aforementioned deadline, I was denied my beloved French Toast Combo (2 eggs, choice of meat, 3 pieces of French Toast)  C'mon Jimmie...lighten up!"}
{"text":"The HORROR. The HORROR.
What happened? This used to be a good place to eat.
My wife and I stopped in tonight for dinner. Short wait, no big deal.
Our waitress came over and took our drink order (two glasses of water).
We both ordered the turkey with dressing. I had mashed potatoes and gravy and green beans.
My wife had mac and cheese and fried okra.
As an appetizer we ordered the fried pickles.

First, the water tasted like mold. This is usually the result of a dirty filter in the ice machine.
Second, the fried pickles where not too great. Now I have had an issue with fried pickles with many restaurants in the Charlotte area, so I did not put very much weight on this one dish.
We moved on to the entrée. This is where the nightmare begins. If they just brought me the turkey with nothing else I would have been all right. Unfortunately it came with stuffing made out of bread, cranberries, cinnamon, apples, and what I can only assume was an old inner tube. The entire concoction was drenched in a gravy that was laced with red peeper, some kind of green flecks, and more red pepper. I have never gotten heartburn from turkey and dressing before, but I guess there is first time for everything. The mashed potatoes where also slathered with this \"Death Gravy\" so they did not make the grade as well. 

The waitress wanted to get something else for me and I ordered a cheese burger as a consolation but, by the time I had gotten it the stomach pains had become unbearable, so we decided to cut our losses and pay the bill. The manager rang us up, but was very rude to us. It was if he was blaming me for not eating his crappy food."}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast and lunch.  Being a breakfast fan, I appreciated their food.... this place does get super busy on Sundays though - If you have time to burn I'd definitely check this Mint Hill spot out - not if you are in a rush though!  

I had the Popeye Salad (spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, I opted not to put the feta cheese on and put baked salmon instead with a balsamic vinaigrette).  Good size and taste... the salad was definitely more rustic in that most of the veggies were very rough chopped (if at all) so you get big slices of mushrooms and halves of roma tomatoes - I didn't mind at all.

Service was nice, but they got so busy when they had a lunch rush our server didn't come back to check on us - we weren't needing anything else but refills so we survived."}
{"text":"Breakfast like it should be!  I'm from Chicago where we have great breakfast places everywhere.  Since moving to NC I haven't found a breakfast place to love... Until now.  I went this morning with a hankering for an omelet and was not disappointed.  I had a cheddar omelet with mushrooms, tomatoes, and spinach, and paired it with a mountain of hash browns and bacon.  They did everything right.  My fiancé got a mountain, really, a mountain of French toast which he raved over.  I am so excited to have a go to spot for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place has most definitely gone down. They must have changed cooks, because the peas taste like water and the corn bread was extremely dry. They use to serve very decent collard greens, but not this visit. I noticed a older crowd gathers there(which I'm not mad about) I think I will leave them alone for about  a year, and then go back... maybe they'll have a new cook by then."}
