{"text":"First time in tonight, ordered a pizza and some bbq wings. Not bad. I like thin crust, but this was very thin (see thru) and barely any sauce. However, overall pizza and wings were tasty. Wings were not greasy or fatty, like other pizza places in the area.
We will go here again,many other menu items also."}
{"text":"Easy place to find, we had a Living Social deal and went to use it last night.  Clean inside, don't let the depressing-looking strip mall setting deter you, because the food is GREAT.  We ordered the sub sandwiches to go, a Turkey and a BLT and they were delicious and worth the drive. We'll be back again.  Well-lit, clean inside, service was prompt and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"I wanted to add to my review since I've now been able to try delivery. When I placed my order I was told there would be a half hour wait, but was surprised with a delivery that took less than 23 minutes from start to finish. Superb pizza and fast service."}
{"text":"Papa Kelsey's is fantastic! The oven toasted subs are easily one of the greatest things available on the menu. The pizza is great, and the buy one pizza get another for 99 cents on Tuesday is a fantastic deal that keeps me coming back! That deal doesn't just apply to pizza either. On Saturday you can get a crazy large 12 inch calzone, and add another for 99 cents, and calzones are delicious too. Also, you can choose what goes inside them, which is very helpful when you have friends who are picky. The people who work there are funny and friendly, especially when you're on the phone ordering for a delivery. I can't wait for their online orders to start up, it'll make ordering much more convenient."}
{"text":"They have changed the bread for the subs.  More like subway...dry and tasteless!  Go back to what you had before :)"}
{"text":"Really relaxed and chill hangout. Great food, decent prices, and awesome service. Also, they have sweet retro arcade games like Ms. Pacman and the original Metal Slug!!! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Caution: Confirm your coupon wasn't fraudulently sold to you before ordering!

Classic pizzeria.  Great manager (thanks for reaching out). Delicious pizza."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great food at a fair price Papa Kelsey's is the place.  Not only is the food absolutely Delicious, (we drive 20mi each way just to eat there) but the customer service is great as well.  Every time we come in we are greeted with a smile, and served promptly.  

I love the pizza!  I'm simple, cheese is my favorite so it's hard to mess that up.  However, I am a huge fan of the thin crust, the sauce is great, and ingredients are quality.  The boyfriend loves the subs, which says a lot because he is really picky when it comes to his sandwiches.

My boyfriend and I are also HUGE supporters of small, locally owned businesses that keep the money in our communities.  With that being said, not only is Papa Kelsey's a great locally owned business they are also a big part of the community.  
They give back to local schools by donating a portion of the daily sales and allow charities to do donation jars.   

The rewards program is great, and once you eat there you are going to want to go back again and again, so your rewards will add up quickly.  :-)  Mine do anyways.

I enjoy everything about Papa Kelsey's and hope you can venture in and fall in love with the food just like many others have."}
{"text":"We have been to Papa Kelsey's a few times and we love the pizza!  The crust is delicious and the pizza is very flavorful.  We like the atmosphere.  A very good local pizzaria.  The pizza was done in 20 minutes.  We will go back and may have to try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Have eaten lunch here many times, excellent food, great service and a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed Papa Kelsey's Pizza. Started out with a great host to order our pizza. Was helpful with suggestions. Our salad was out with in 2 minutes, and the pizza not far behind. Very good pizza. ALL of the staff was friendly and helpful. Even heard them offer to help a customer bring out a large order to their car."}
{"text":"This place has oven baked subs that are absolutely amazing! I highly suggest the Steak Sub. It is so delicious. Take the family, this place had lots of people there for lunch, so I am surprised there are no reviews. I posted their menu, so I hope you all enjoy!

I can't wait to try their pizza!"}
{"text":"They recently updated the interior, looks and feels much nicer.  Probably got an extra star from me for that.  The food is good.  The staff/service are great.  Not my favorite place, but good enough to be in our regular rotation when we are in the mood.  The Italian sub and the steak subs are good.  The pizza is good.."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!  First time customer tonight, ordered online. Got the 1-topping lg pizza + 20 wings deal. Figured the cheese pizza and hot wings would be a good introduction. YUM!! Pizza was cooked perfect, great flavor, love the crust. Hot wings are SO good! Ridiculously fast delivery too! Very happy customer."}
{"text":"I am updating my previous review. I had a pretty bad costumer service experience and didnt even end up trying the pizza!! The manager went out of his way to give me a free pizza, and even though I had moved out of my parents by the time I noticed his messages, he still let my parents take advantage of free pizza!! I am a huge believer that customer service builds the entire experience, and I am blown out of the water by the wonderful service I have received!"}
{"text":"I had seen Papa Kelsey's when looking online. I have been looking for a good pizza place for the last 11 years since coming to Arizona. I was spoiled with 2 great places where I lived in New Mexico. I finally ordered from this place tonight. I was a bit worried because when I had not seen the delivery guy in 50 mins like they quoted online. I was excited to get a phone call from them when it was 5 mins later then they had quoted. They told me if any problems with the food like it not being hot they would take care of it. That was outstanding to have great customer service.
I need to talk about the pizza it was not super hot but still a great temperature. It was great from the first bite. I am in love and would come back just for the pizza it is the best pizza place to me in the area. 
I also ordered wings. I was excited they had a option to make the wings crispy. They were not dried out like I have ate before in other places. The sauce was amazing on them.
I have to say I am excited that I have found a great place!!! I will be ordering again from this place. Definitely give this place a try you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Where do I start?  This place is FABULOUS!  We've been living permanently in AZ for five years and didn't have a good, go-to pizza place until we happened upon Papa Kelsey's.  The food is wonderful and the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating.  Very clean restaurant, including the bathrooms.  We ordered a hot sub and a large pizza.  Both came to our table piping hot in only 12 minutes.  We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Papa Kelsey's for 15 years so writing a review for this place will be like writing a review for a x girlfriend you still have feelings for. At one point Papa's was it, there wasn't anything out on this side of town but fat willy's and pizza hut(yuk on both). Now there are so many options for pizza, it makes papa's sub-par at best. But the subs, there is something in  the bread that drags me back. Not really into the 70's decor but I'm there for food, so let's not dwell! I'm going with the three stars because I think even the subs could step there game up. In the restaurant bizz the competition is huge, & you have to be willing to adapt to change. If you are going to charge 9 bucks for a footlong then I want higher quality meats & cheeses like boars head! That is where my love for papa's has changed, there are a lot of great sandwich shops and you better believe if they have the goods I'm in! So papa I still will come around every now & then but like the x, feelings will never be the same."}
{"text":"The Pizza and Subs are really good - if you're eating in - the atmosphere is a little dated - I wouldn't take you're date there - but a family atmosphere it is fine..."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Apache Junction I swing by for a quick slice or sub great service fast service and the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Yuck! I hate spending my money on bad food!!! We used to go to Papa's a lot years ago, and thought we'd give it a try, as the reviews seemed pretty decent. First, don't be fooled by the pictures online. The food doesn't look ANYTHING like them! The pizza was on a thin crust, not anything like the picture! The crust was tough and the toppings, sparse! The wings...well, the picture shows a Buffalo style wing. What I got was a breaded soggy mess! Gross! No sauce at all. They were so soggy, I just threw them out. TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"I should have tried the subs, according to the other reviews those are good. We got 4 pizzas and not one of them was even edible. They were tasteless and the toppings were blah. I would never get the pizza again. Had it not been the Tuesday night special where the 2nd pizza was 99 cents, I would have felt completely ripped off."}
{"text":"Food is awesome! Been eating there since 2000. Pizza is good but I love the sandwiches. Chill vibe"}
{"text":"Wow!  Not a huge fan of the classic sub - I was totally blown away by Papa Kelsey's Sub sandwich.  Fresh bread and crisp vegetables compliment your choice of fixings! The staff is friendly and accommodating.  We enjoyed our lunch in the nice clean cafe styled restaurant, but they offer take out as well as daily specials. YUM!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza through the app Papa Kelsey's offers. Applied a coupon that was available and placed my order. The app removed my pizza from the order and Kent who claimed to be the manager was VERY unprofessional and unhelpful. Will ever order from a rip off restaurant that will not correct the technology they put out. The app states if you have any issues call the store. I didn't realize the issue until I got a delivery of only wings NO Pizza! Shame"}
{"text":"Love the veggie pizza!  Great service...very friendly.  Super prices and specials. Hubby loves the Hawaiian pizza."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I have eaten here and I remembered it and thought I would try it again. I ordered a toasted sub, Vegetarian, and I took items off, and added items. It was just as delicious as I remembered. Their subs are delicious! Next time though I will ask for easy onions and extra lettuce, since this sub was opposite. Plus they have FRITOS! Hard to find nowadays. The reason not a 5 star is I think the employees could be a bit friendlier. Dropping off my sub and walking away without a word is kind of rude. Plus I would like to see either oil and vinegar or Italian dressing available for subs. Next time (and of course there will be one) I will try the pizza"}
{"text":"Finally a decent pizza in Mesa AZ!  We recently relocated from Southern California and have visited Barro's  and Venezia's.  Both a big fail earning 1 star reviews. There pies lack flavor and cheese.  
Papa Kelsey's  hit a home run and we killed this 14\" pie in 20 minutes flat!  Super awesome, and I highly recommend if your searching for something close to NY style pizza.   Yep , nothing in AZ will compare to Bronx Pizza in San Diego, CA or John's Brick Oven Pizza in NYC, however it gets a solid B+ for Arizona and therefore 5 well deserved Yelp stars. 
We will order again next week. Thanks Papa K's"}
{"text":"Me and my family had been ordering from here for years and had always enjoyed it. That held true until tonight. I ordered wings, as we usually do, but to my surprise when we got home to enjoy the normally savory wings there was no sauce on them. I called to try and rectify the issue as I was sure it was just an correctable oversight but the lady decided to argue with me and swear that she had \"shook\" them herself. I dunno you be the judge, either way as a customer I was no very appreciative of the service and have all intentions spending my money somewhere else from here on out. It was a good run papa Kelsey's. Since we could not come to a amicable solution through the denial of error I thought I would do the only thing I could as a consumer and post about my recent experience. Have a good day yelpers"}
{"text":"Having worked in Mesa for a year, I've begun exhausting all my local food options. The search for good eats has forced me into rural and uncharted territory like Apache Junction. 

In my desperation to find something new, I perused the local yelp listings for something, ANYTHING besides burgers and fast food to satiate my craving. My hunger pangs were crippling and I was barely able to scroll through listing after listing after listing of boring burger places and grill-type selections. I almost gave up when, suddenly, an unfamiliar name caught my eye. Papa Kelsey's. Having never heard of anyone in the Kelsey family, much less Papa himself, I decided to peruse the photos and I was not disappointed. 

I decided to take advantage of an online coupon for a large, 3-topping pizza for $8.99. I thought, \"Meh. What have I got to lose?\" So I placed my order. 

I arrived to the restaurant at exactly 11am where the smell of fresh pizza embraced me with welcoming love. Oh, this was already a promising sign. All over the restaurant were signs and hommages to the All Mighty Pizza. The layout is very open with movable tables all around. Perfect place for a party if need be. 

I went up to the counter to pick up my order but decided to add the meat ravioli because when do you ever see MEAT ravioli on a menu? Score. The cashier was super friendly and very accommodating. She seemed a little rushed (I may have spoken too slowly - I don't know) but that didn't take away from her warm presence. 

Now.....to the pizza. Oh my goodness. I don't remember what happened after I blacked out but I swear I saw pepperoni unicorns and dancing mushrooms. The crust was so delicious and crispy. The toppings and sauce were perfect. I was so excited that I shared with everyone in my clinic. Not a single person hated it. Not even that hater Amy - and she hates everything. Papa Kelsey's Pizza for the win. 

Now even though I give five-stars (well deserved), not everything was amazing. The meat ravioli was a bit of a let down. I actually had to spit out my first bite because the taste of freezer-burn was pretty strong and heavy. Unfortunately, no one else wanted it so I wound up throwing it away. Still, everything else was wonderful and I'll definitely be coming back. Just not for the ravioli. That was offensive."}
{"text":"Our first time here found the service was friendly and helpful.  The atmosphere was fine, and the restaurant is clean and inviting.  The food quality was right on - especially the warm bread on the subs.  We will definitely be back!  I had a grilled chicken sub and my husband the taco sub.  Many choices of subs and pizza."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a good pizza place in Mesa...besides Barros (the best so far)... and decided to give this place a try.  It was horrible. I could have bought a frozen pizza from the store and been completely satisfied. Even our kids were not happy. We ordered 2 Large pizzas...which from other places gives us plenty of left overs...that we're more like mediums. It was just enough to feed the kids.
We will not be ordering from their again. 
Only good thing I can say about it was that the delivery driver was very nice. 

Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I am super disappointed in this place. The medium pizza we got was first of all very small, very thin and had no flavor at all. It was like one of those pizzas you make when you are little or like a lunchable pizza. We also got the wings, very soggy as well. If you live in he Mesa area stick to bella's!"}
{"text":"Was in town visiting family, and Grandma recommended this place. Being from out of town we said ok. I had a calzone with black olives. I'll tell you in was the perfect size. Some places can make a gargantuan calzone and then you're stuck either tossing or taking home 20% of your calzone. Not this place. Just the right size, nice crispy but soft dough, not skimpy on the olives. Well done. 

Got my daughter a black olive and cheese pizza. (Liking olives is a must in my family). She killed it without even batting an eyelash. 

Good little spot that you gotta know otherwise you'll miss it. But it's on my radar now."}
{"text":"Went here on the recommendation of a friend. Not bad, but I've had a lot better. A step or two up from Pizza Hut to be sure,  I prefer Sourdough just up the road or Streets of New York on Signal Butte."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and sub to-go (Keep in mind this was my first time here)  the place looks clean plenty of people in there eating lunch , I was in line waiting to pay and I seen the cook poke his nose and wipe it on his pants he continued to prepare more subs and pizza with out washing his hands.  I ask to speak with a manager (Andy) he ends up being the manager  and I was very respectful when I asked for a refund and gave him the reason.   Stay away from this place or at least just only eat there when Andy the nose picker is not working*** but from what I understand he's been there 3 years."}
{"text":"Man is this place great! Amazing sandwiches and pizzas too! So happy this is in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I went to Papa Kelsey's because they had a promotion for my daughter's school.  They were donating 10% of the day's profits to her school.  

I had one of their calzones and it delicious!  You can ask for whatever you want in their calzones so that was a plus.  

My daughter had one of their hot subs and she thought it was really good and my husband and son had their pizza.  

I tried a slice of the cheese pizza and it was good quality...not great...just good.  
But the prices were very reasonable.  My family of 4 ate for around $35.  

The service was a little bumpy because the person behind the counter was new.  But the manager made up for it by correcting the new employee, getting us what we needed and continued to check on us to make sure we were happy.

I also signed up for their rewards points system where you get discounts for being a repeat customer of theirs."}
{"text":"Finally,  a well cooked thin pizza!  It's been my holy grail for years in the east valley.  Delicious with plenty of toppings, crisp flavourful crust and a tangy sauce ( I loath sweet sauce).  Oh,  and delivery was prompt and courteous!  I can't wait to dine in and to try the subs. My fiance is a meatball sub fanatic and I've heard great things.  My new favorite go-to pizza place.  Bye bye Venezia pizza with your soggy, nasty crust."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! Has the family owned feel to the atmosphere. Their delivery driver Brittane is so nice and really fast. Cute too! I love to get their Honey BBQ Hot boneless wings with ranch. So delicious. The pizzas and subs are all amazing and they have new really delish chicken strips. Recommend this place! Way better than a Pizza Hut or a Papa Murphies. The owner, Andy, is awesome as well. He came out and checked to make sure everything to my satisfaction On point! KEEP IT UP PAPA KELSEYS! :)"}
{"text":"Motivated by a Groupon and the fact that this place is close to my house, I tried Papa Kelsey's last night. Considering the location which is a half dead strip mall, I wasn't expecting much. What a surprise! First of all, the place is really BIG! They have lots of tables and everything looked notably squeaky clean! They have ample bench seating for people waiting for takeout orders! 
They have one style of crust and it is pretty close to being labelled as thin, which is great with me. I ordered the garlic pizza (white, olive oil) with fresh tomato slices. It was so flavorful and generously cheesy and the tomatoes gave it such a bright fresh zing.
I also ordered the meatball sub. The bread was soft and fresh, the meatballs were tender and addicting! Again, generously cheesy.
I'll be back to try more things!"}
{"text":"Have been eating at Papa Kelsey's for about 20+ years. The original owners sold it to Andy and things did change over the years, but definitely for the better. The wings he brought in are the Best! We order ours extra crispy mild, with a side of hot sauce to spice them up a bit. We love their pizza, our grandkids are huge fans of their bacon pizza. The subs are great and our favorite is the BLT on wheat with double bacon, extra crispy!! The employees are awesome and friendly. Andy the owner, Kent and Linda are great and make us feel right at home when we eat there. We took our neighbors for wings and pizza a couple of weeks ago and they are hooked. Highly recommend this family owned restaurant.  Sher and Ron"}
{"text":"It's been a couple years since I tried this place,  I loved it then and I still love it now. I don't go here for the pizza, can't say I've ever tried it, I go for the subs. The Cowboy is fantastic, but my loyalty is to the Club Sub. The family has branched out and tried other subs off the menu and not one complaint. I will continue to drive out of my way to get a sub."}
{"text":"Ordered 6 hot boneless wings, got them fairly quick and I think these were pre cooked and sat under a light because some were warm on the outside and inside. But some were warm and cold on the inside. Only 1 though so not a big deal. Pizza was nice and cooked and good in flavor. Better for pizza and not wings."}
{"text":"Talked with Andy D. he was extremely nice and helpful. Had issues with previous order and Andy worked to hard to fix them. Pizza is still good. Will come back again. Thank U Andy."}
{"text":"New owner (for a few years) has really made a difference in this place! 

The decor is much cleaner and nicer, the food is even better than it was, and now it has wings!  Our family favorite!  They are delicious also!  

Sandwich's are still fantastic, and the pizza has been upgraded in a big way! 

Love this place to come with the family and just have a great time!"}
{"text":"Pizza arrived clammy and nervous . Ended up having to try and eat it with a fork . 
Sad panda ."}
{"text":"Never had a problem until today. Gave 1 star. Order food to be picked up at 5pm. My husband was there a few moments of 5pm. They didn't give us our food till 5:30. This lady came in after my husband. She order her pizza and her food. The food I order online should of be ready at 5pm. Plus the pizza was cold. Thanks for making dinner not wonderful. Don't forget I order the food at 12:22 this afternoon for 5pm"}
{"text":"Let me just say, this was the first time ordering pizza from Papa Kelsey's and I'm sorry that I didn't, sooner.  Tonight, I ordered the Papa Kelsey's special and it was delicious!  They don't skimp on the toppings and it had a yummy crispy crust.  I loved the inside of the restaurant because it reminded me of the old school pizza places with video games and tv's.  Very clean inside and according to my receipt, the gentleman that helped me was named Cody.  He was very pleasant and so was the gentleman that brought my pizza to me.  Next time, we'll be dining in and trying other items on their very generous menu.  Thank you and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here about once a month, but haven't been here for awhile, last time I ate here they had the cowboy cut sub sandwich ,but they don't have that anymore. They used to have the best subs, but they changed the bread and the sub tastes different.  I will not go back"}
{"text":"Alright, I have been searching high and low for a cream-of-the-crop pizza joint in the East Valley. Not a fancy fufu pizza place, but a down-to-earth, hot, cheesy, greasy pizza that would leave me craving for more.

I have lived in the East Valley for 10 years and found a couple places I thought were good pies, Having moved from Cleveland, Ohio, I enjoyed some great pizzas that were super tasty. Out here all you find is NY thin or Chicago deep dish, nothing in between, and chain after chain restaurants. Not my cup of tea. I want local! However, I never lived far enough East in Mesa to venture over to check this place out. I surely regret it now.

Since recently temporarily moving in with some family in AJ, it's been a real struggle to find decent food this far out, period. It seriously is not the same as in Mesa, or Gilbert, or Chandler. I have always been on the hunt for a great pizza and I have finally found THE ONE! Just walking in the door tonight, my gut told me good things. The smell was incredible and took me back to my primo pizzeria place back in Ohio. This place is a good 15 minute drive for me but I got it back home still hot and fresh.

Ordered a large pepperoni and an Italian sub for the wife. Let me tell you, I nearly ate the entire thing! Had to push myself away from the table. You know you've have those meals where you just can't stop! Well, this was it for me tonight. The ingredients were great, you taste that it's fresh. The cheese was awesome, just the right amount of sauce (not too sweet or sour), and the buttery crust (not too thick or thin) was fantastic. Maybe I've just been deprived of great pizza for so long that it made it that much extra special. I kind of doubt it though. This place has earned a top spot in my belly to quench my pizza cravings. You owe it to yourself to try it out.

As others have said, there is nothing fancy about the place itself, but it counts where it matters most, in the actual food. Please don't change a thing Papa Kelsey! I'll be a bit heartbroken when the time comes to move on down to the SE Valley."}
{"text":"We couldn't wait to get back to Mesa.  Our first stop was at Papa Kelsey's because we spent the entire summer missing their fabulous subs and pizza.  We've been here for a week and a half and have been to Papa Kelsey's 3 times.  It was just like coming home!"}
{"text":"In the mood for a hot sub, I once again tried my hand at Papa Kelsey's. I was delighted to find that the online ordering system was working. I noticed a few things here: 1. the page 'online ordering' link didn't work. You have to use the upper menu to reach the page. 2. You can't order a smaller 16oz or similar beverage. Only a 2-liter. And 3. If you are picking up, your only option for payment is 'cash', which I found to mean that you could just pay with your card or cash upon arrival.

The hot steak sub and hot veggie subs were great. The potato spudsters are always a hit in our house. There were also some macadamia cookies in stock, so the man was super excited...those are his favorite! Soft and flavorful.

My order was ready in less time than expected, which was a nice change from previous reviews. Chris and the other man in the kitchen were very friendly and professional. I saw Chris serve a dine-in customer, and was impressed, considering what I have witnessed in the past.

I would also like to note that boss-man Andy reached out after my last review and offered a voucher to come back to the shop. I didn't make it prior to expiration, but it was a very kind gesture, and it seems that some changes may have been made in-store. I appreciate when folks take to heart the concerns, and also positive comments on their establishments. Local word of mouth is still a thing, lest some forget.

I will be back, Andy. Thanks."}
{"text":"Great food the papa kelseys specialty pizza was awesome. Chicken wings crispy just the way I like it. Server were nice even cashier Lexi was helpful. Will come back with kids."}
{"text":"Ate a medium pizza the first time and first time there and thought pizza was good!, 2nd time I ordered a large pizza!, if that is large!, i hate to see the small one!!! I think the large looks like a medium!! In any other pizza restaurant, will never go here again!!!!! Never saw a large pizza that looks like a medium!! Its a con!!!!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time. I had an Italian sub, and the hubs had a meatball bomber. Both were really tasty. Much better than the typical chain subs, and very reasonable with BOGO coupon. The place was really clean and seemed to be well run. We will definitely go back and try the pizza, wings and calzones!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm not much of a sandwich person, but this place makes the best subs I've ever had! I'm not sure what sets theirs apart, maybe the bread? Its soft in the middle with a light, crispy crust. There is always plenty of fresh, flavorful, meat/cheese/vegs, it is just so delicious! I've also had their pizza in the past, it was pretty good too. Pizza and sandwiches are reasonably priced, the fried zucchini however is not...it was tasty, but at $6 for 8 quarter sized slices, it is grossly overpriced! I will be back, but I won't be ordering the zucchini again."}
{"text":"Ok I think this place is amazing. They deliver.  Never takes them long. The kids love the food. I think there cheese sticks are to die for! And the bread?? Killer. You can tell they make it all there. Price is reasonable. Neighborhood is a little sketchy but they do deliver! Just a cute ma and Pa pizza place with pretty good food.  PS the wings are great too!"}
{"text":"Funky little joint whipping up old school real deal pizza, subs and always fresh never frozen wings since 1992! Glad I stopped by today, my sausage pepperoni pizza was off the chain! Foods cooked to order but came out rather quick. They have a sign saying this is not FAST food. And their right, you can taste that in every bite.
Staff was friendly, place was super clean, great prices, how could it get any better you might ask. How about 3 old school full size arcade games! With my favorite Ms. Pac-man! 
Can't wait to come back and try some more killer combos."}
{"text":"We recently moved from this side of town to the other side of Mesa. I miss this place. I miss it terribly. My 5 year old recently asked to have his birthday here and we gladly made the trek over. When we called and gave a heads up that we had a larger party and pre-ordered our pizzas, they set up tables for us without us asking. They have awesome specials (Tuesday is buy one pizza, get one for 99 cents; Sundays is the same deal with calzones). They recently started delivering, which is thrilling since I work at a nearby school and can now get my PK fix!

Try the pizza...they have awesome crust. Try the sub club...it's divine. 

PS- be patient. I've seen people lose their minds over the wait time. It's worth it because you know your food hasn't been sitting and dying under a heat lamp."}
{"text":"This place could be dangerous - it's right down the street from my house.

Papa Kelsey's is tucked in a strip mall off Apache Trail and Ellsworth. It doesn't look like much from the front, but it's definitely worth stopping by. It is very comfortable and clean inside.

And the food is delicious! I tried the chicken oven baked sub and my husband had the steak. He said the steak is one of the best subs he's ever had and I agree. The bread is amazing.

I signed up for their Loyalty program after getting home and got a coupon for 50% off a pizza right away. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant if you go during the day when the owner is running the kitchen. Everything, from pizza to subs and chicken wings are amazingly good. 5 stars. However, the two times we've been there at night, it's like a different restaurant. Especially the pizza and chicken wings. During the day the wings are crispy and so good. At night the skin is still soft and squishy, and for us that's not so good. 3 stars at night, hence my 4 star average!"}
{"text":"Just average. Not much more to say.  I had the meatball sub. First three bites were sauce and bread granted they were small bites.  I was afraid to take big bites cause it was mushy and kind of exploded in my hands. Resorted to fork and knife, but I found the meatballs. My husband had the Italian and he said his was fine.  Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my lightly toasted half turkey sub ($4.99). It had a generous amount of moist turkey and fresh veggies on delicious bread. The service at the counter was rather glum and mechanical, but my sandwich was ready in about five minutes. The dining area was clean, with nice background music. Plenty of specials and offers were also available to keep the price reasonable. Overall, very nice."}
{"text":"Fast, good service. I would give the calzone 4 stars, but the pizza and hot wings 3 stars. The calzone was legit, and the sauce that came with it seemed better than the sauce on the pizza. Problem is, there wasn't enough sauce on the pizza, and I don't even like a ton of sauce. The hot wings were just okay. I will be coming back for the calzones, for sure!"}
{"text":"The wings! Huge, meaty, perfectly cooked and sauced generously. My wife loves the honey bbq and the suicide is favorite! The subs are enormous and toasted. The Cowboy or the meatball sub are guaranteed to put a smile on any meatlovers face. Prices are good and they have some great specials! 
They offer delivery which is FAST!! The drivers are polite and charming. The staff from top to bottom are friendly and work their butts off to make every customer feel welcome and happy. 
I just learned that in addition to the regular 4-9 delivery hours. They deliver from 11a.m. on Friday, Saturday and Sunday! Wish I had known that during college football season! GO BIG RED!! 
I love this place. It is my neighborhood pizza joint. The fact that they have arcade style video games makes it super popular with the kids too."}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings in town! Honey BBQ Hot wings are the best, perfectly crispy and flavorful. We've even had their hot sandwiches before, also amazing! Not only do they have great food, but the staff is also very friendly every time we visit."}
{"text":"Counter ordering. Dine in or take out. Great food. Little ambience. I would come here again."}
{"text":"We have lived in this area for 4 years now and always wondered about this place. We stopped in and ordered a regular old sausage and onion pizza. We weren't very impressed. Maybe we'll go back and try a sub at some point but I wouldn't recommend the pizza."}
{"text":"The owner reached out to me after I left a 3 star review last week and complained about the lack of customer service. He told me that this wasn't the norm and said I would receive better service if I came back in the future.

He was right! I went back on a Thursday at lunch time and ordered a large sausage pizza and a regular sized calzone with sausage. The young man at the counter greeted me as soon as I walked in and provided excellent customer service. (and the owner reaching out to someone who left a mediocre review is good customer service in and of itself!)

There were a LOT of \"snow birds\" in the dining area when I walked in to pick up my order. Clearly they like Papa Kelsey's! 

Unfortunately, the calzone didn't taste as good as the one I ordered last week and it was overcooked like the first one. The pizza had TONS of sausage and just the right amount of cheese. This is where I feel bad because there is nothing wrong with the pizza here. It is just not the type of pizza I like. I grew up on pizzeria pizza which is a different style than this (see Rosati's). The sausage tastes like the kind that comes frozen in a bag. It doesn't taste like fresh Italian sausage that is broken off by hand and placed on the pizza like the pizzerias do it. 

I will say they are better than Domino's, Papa John's and Little Caesar's and the bathroom was one of the cleanest I have ever seen in a casual dining restaurant. (clean bathrooms tell me a lot about a restaurant).

You have a good thing going there, just not what I was looking for. Wish you the best Papa Kelsey's!"}
{"text":"This place partner's with my daughter's PTO and a portion of the proceeds goes to help the school which is really great. So now on PTO nights, we always order Papa Kelsey's. Their pizzas are good and their calzones are even better! The meatballs they have are excellent in the calzone with a little bit of extra marinara sauce."}
{"text":"Love this place! My boyfriend and I get takeout from them at least once a week. The pizza and pasta is always fantastic. I love that they don't have a ton of random items of their menu. Pizza, pasta, and sandwiches is the focus and they do them well!"}
{"text":"I had a Papa Kelsey's Special Pizza while my wife had a Calzones with extra toppings  like tomato, green bell pepper, olives and onion. We both ordered two Italian salad with blue cheese and ranch dressing. Can't believe I had so much root beer.
Over all the food was alright. We had a good lunch. One of their booth seats, the upholstery is torn. Not a good thing. But, Folks like what I said we have to continually support our local restaurants."}
{"text":"This place has horrible customer service I had an online coupon and had trouble using it in my phone it says on their website to call them if you need any assistance you can place order on phone the gentleman that answered the phone was very rude. I explained to him U had a online coupon and was having trouble ordering it on the phone he laughed . I didn't think it was very funny. I asked if I could order it on the phone he said it's an online coupon. I said I understand that but your website says call if I'm having trouble .What a big help he was .He acted like I was stupid . He needs a class in customer service"}
{"text":"II've only ever door dashed but the food was amazing. really greasy but I wasnt complaining! The calzones and wings are my go to! And the service was SO friendly. Definitely a new favorite for me."}
{"text":"\"When someone under promises and over delivers, it means that he or she sets the bar low and then exceeds that bar. In a simple example, a delivery company might promise that something will be dropped off by noon, setting the bar, and then tell the driver to make sure that the object is delivered by ten in the morning, thereby exceeding the expectations of the customer. The idea behind this concept is that, by keeping customer expectations low and routinely exceeding them, an individual or company will develop a good reputation.\"

I was told a simple order of 2 large 1 topping pizzas would take 20-25 minutes. Understandably the place was busier than normal as it's usually only 10-15. But having to have waited in excess of 50 minutes for my simple order.. I was rather disappointed. It's decent pizza but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"They are aweosme and love their pizza. Really good pizza for the price. They deliver and have great customer service. Good place to go with family or on a date"}
{"text":"We always order here. The pizza is amazing and so flavorful! The wings are really good too! We don't order from anywhere else now!"}
{"text":"Papa Kelseys is my favorite pizza place. Growing up my parents always ordered pizza here. I miss the soups they used to have but it's still a great place. The spudsters are a huge hit in my family. We usually have to order two or three large orders so there's enough depending on how many are eating. My 16 month old even loves the food here and my husband loves the wings. There really is something for the whole family. I've never had a problem with them throughout the years. I would definitely recommend going here at least once to try it. Plus there rewards system is awesome."}
{"text":"This a perfect neighborhood restaurant with great sub's and pizza. My favorite is the Taco Sub, it is a must have. Great for family's and good weekly specials. Also fast delivery."}
{"text":"The service was amazing and friendly. The place looks very clean and maintained. The  food was great, the bread for the subs taste homemade, very soft and flaky. I had the pizza sub and spudsters. This place is definitely Canyon State Beard Club approved!"}
{"text":"YUP! I was already a fan based on their Calzone, but after trying their Meatball Sub, I'm sold! May I buy stock? 

Big, flavorful, and the bread they use, OMG! Apparently they have it specially made for them daily and it is so fresh and soft. For a lack of a more original description, it seemingly \"Melts in Your Mouth.\"  It was REALLY good! I ordered a full, which is really large enough for two and thankfully they cut it in half, which makes it easy to take the other half home with you. However, I cannot lie, it was so good I had to take a few bites of my other half, which was supposed to go home with me. 

Now, if I'm being 100% honest here, it could have used a smidge more sauce, but now I'm just being anal! This place is where it's at!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time unless you have plenty of time to waste. Took 50 minutes to get a chicken parm sub and wasn't even busy"}
{"text":"Great service. Highly recommend the olive oil specialty pizza. Always good & so are the salads."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best pizza place around. We haven't tried the subs but the pizza is cooked perfectly and the wings are amazing!  The also have great deals like a rewards program and on Tuesday buy one get one for $2. Quick delivery."}
{"text":"These guys serve the best subs!!!  We have had subs, pizza & soup and including the chili.  We have not had a bad meal there ever.   We find the staff very friendly and ready to assist at any time you need.   Good atmosphere & good food, what more can you ask for.  The manager even goes around to make sure everything is okay with everyone in the restaurant."}
