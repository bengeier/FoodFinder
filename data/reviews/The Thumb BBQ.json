{"text":"This review is two parts. 

Part 1. I love the food and atmosphere here and they are open late and the staff is always very cheerful. A great time no matter when you go and the food is great.

Part 2. Its a great car wash. Its not the fastest service I've ever had so don't stop in if you're in a rush but overall they do a very good job. No spray wax though.... whats up with that?"}
{"text":"Holy Cow has this place become popular!! It's packed and the service is still fast and BBQ brisket is tastier than ever! Even the Girl Scouts are here selling cookies out front.  LOVE the old fashion neighborhood feel."}
{"text":"Food is great, but the service can be slow when they are busy.  One of the better BBQ places in the valley that we frequent when craving BBQ.  I get the two meats with brisket and pulled pork and my wife gets either the tacos with the same meats or the quesadilla.  Overall, we are fans."}
{"text":"Flat out the best kept secret in Scottsdale. This little marketplace and BBQ is fantastic. The food is great, the staff I s stellar and they may serve the best Grits this side of Georgia. Oh and you can get your tank gassed up and car washed while enjoying dinner on the patio."}
{"text":"This place is top notch and a very welcome addition to the area. Tom's Thumb masterfully combines a gas station (great gas prices and full service lanes), car wash (no annoying hard sell folks on commission and top quality car wash and detail shop), coffee bar, mini gourmet grocery store, restaurant, wine bar (coming, I'm told) all in one building. 

Everything I've had at their cafe, Campfire Bistro, is excellent.  Try the bbq sampler plate or any beef brisket item for lunch or dinner. The breakfast tacos, waffles and other breakfast items (including some lighter fare items) are all excellent. 

The car wash deserves additional kudos.  If you have a car that you are uncomfortable having someone wash or detail (including any classic or high-end luxury vehicle) -- take it here. You will be impressed. 

Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Besides the amazing environment and food the prices are a little bit to much but the flavor and freshness makes up for it definitely a good place for a meal once in a while"}
{"text":"Great staff and great environment.  I usually get the three meat platter with pulled chicken, pulled port and the sausage is fantastic. Baked beans and mac and cheese for the side. Best BBQ I have had in Phoenix! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"the slider trio was excellent the slaw on the sliders is a nice compliment, I would recommend the brisket slider it tastes the best out of the chix and pork, the chipotle bbq sauce is bomb as well"}
{"text":"I have heard great things about their food for months so my friend and I finally stopped in today. Let's just say...we were very disappointed!  Something must have been going on today, because I noticed the manager visiting two other tables and apologizing for something as he handed one patron a couple of gift cards.  I did not turn around to see how he rectified the other patrons situation.  

My friend and I ordered The Cuban. I used to live in Florida, so I know Cuban sandwiches but I know everyone has their own modification on it and I'm ok with that.  It was simply bland....so very bland!  Both my friend and I reached the same conclusion.....even the pickle chip only had a slight pickle taste to it.  

I consider myself a foodie so yes, I can be a little critical but we couldn't even taste the hardwood smoked flavor.  Also, typically pork is heavily salted and again, only a very slight trace of it to taste.  I will say the pork was juicy and cooked perfectly but it was as if it wasn't seasoned...at all!

So in conclusion, I would try them again just in case they were having a bad day, but only one more chance...it was very.disappointing!  Hopefully my next experience there will match what everyone I have spoken to has expressed!!"}
{"text":"While waiting for my car wash, I ordered the crispy pulled pork over creamy grits with jalapeño bacon (think it was called Pig & Grits) for a late breakfast. At any rate, the inventor of this concoction is an evil genius -- it was awesome and I *highly* recommend. My son ordered the Mac and Cheese and he loved it too. We love this place!!!

Oh yeah, they do a really good job washing your car as well... :)"}
{"text":"A unique setting with great BBQ at a great price. Pulled pork,  brisket, chicken and more. I thoroughly enjoyed the smoked chicken salad and iced tea. Very tasty."}
{"text":"Love our local bistro and car wash stop!  The food is amazing - breakfast, lunch and dinner are all great and the service is great too!  My favorite is the tacos, my husband loves the chicken platter and my kids love the cheese quesadillas!  It is smart to get your car washed while enjoying your meal.  I also frequently stop in just to get gas - so easy!  I was a fan before Guy Fieri discovered this great bbq joint!  5 Stars all the way! Don't forget all the wine and cute knick knacks they sell - great last minute hostess gifts!"}
{"text":"I think Tom's Thumb has declined over the past couple years so I'm taking it from 5 to 4 stars and I think I am being generous. The food is much more hit or miss. I still generally like it but for example, I am more hesitant to order the pulled pork because it is often fattier than it used to be. Some of the items I order used to come with sides and don't anymore. It was better when it was new."}
{"text":"What an impressive establishment!  I thought once I'd seen one car wash/gas station, I'd seen them all; however, I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in to see it was well beyond what I expected.  I originally came in for just a car wash, but ended up eating lunch as well.  I perused the items in the store while I waited for my lunch.  I think the most interesting part for me was the remarkable wine selection, something that could definitely come in handy one night!  I ended up eating the pulled pork and it was amazing.  Overall, it was a nice break in my day, especially considering I simply stopped in to get a car wash.  After my impromptu lunch, the icing on the cake was that my car came out sparkling clean. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I liked it!  Good meats.  Good sauces.  And you can get a car wash and a fill up and some cool shopping done too!"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ. Don't pass this place up. It's worth the drive. Gas up, get a full service wash and the best pulled pork sandwich west of the Mississippi.  Enjoy Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is an eclectic GEM!!! Delicious BBQ anything. Their Pigs and Grits is super tasty. This dish was actually featured on Guy Fieri's DDD. You will not be sorry! There is something for everyone, even health nuts!"}
{"text":"What a great place.   You don't even need to buy anything to feel good about being here.  Nice people and very interesting selection of local produce, beer, wine, etc...  Great music even!  Everytime I go here the music is wonderful.  Neat Dylan collage in the back too...I heard the story on it.  I think it was the owners album collection or something. 

The best part of all however is the BBQ!  Wonderful selection of breakfast stuff and lunch/dinner.  You can buy the brisket, pulled pork etc...by the pound too which would be great to take home one night for dinner.  It is heavenly BBQ.  Really just great.  

I feel like I am on vacation everytime I walk in this place and havent been disappointed yet.  Its so nice to see an independently owned gas station with an owner that takes every opportunity to share all of his passions with his patrons.  This is certainly not your ordinary gas station.  They have taken it to a whole new level and I admire anybody who \"re-invents\" something that we all thought that we knew everything there was to know about.  To call this a gas station is like calling Fashion Square a strip mall.  Its so much more and its worth the trip."}
{"text":"The best BBQ , salads and sweets. Fantastic Food and Great Gifts! 
Good prices for car services - they do your car while you eat and shop. Free WIFI"}
{"text":"I love this place! Always great service and such great food! My favorite is the Pulled Pork Sandwich with fries."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday and we had to be seated for dinner, it's a car wash!  Service was terrible, food was cold.  Seriously, waitresses are not necessary folks!  They were terrible and that's not the vibe of a car wash...  Not worth the $50 tab."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I had the brisket plate with bow baled beans and baked mac n cheese. Amazing! My wife had a half stack of the brisket stack, and had nothing but great things to say about it. If you want real BBQ and are in the Phoenix area, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food here and even the concept, but the service - not so much. Have to agree with other reviewers - the servers need a course in service and (being mostly millenials) maybe how to fake basic human interaction. And the kitchen needs to step it up also - they seem to move at a pretty leisurely pace.

Long story short, check it out for the food and ambiance but give yourself plenty of time."}
{"text":"The gas pumps and car wash you see from the road will make you think you're at the wrong place.  But head into the parking lot opposite 94th and you are ready to enter the Valhalla of barbeque goodness.  There's a country store sort of like Cracker Barrel but with better merchandise that takes up a lot of the building.  But the real reason you're here is to eat some prime 'Q.  Take time to read the menu because there is quite a selection.  The Andouille sausage sandwich on ciabatta with carmelized onions and the Mexican three-cheese mix, with shoestring fries was a feast.  The wife is more traditional and had the chopped brisket with sweet potato fries.  The brisket was perfect and the sauce superb.  And the outside seating on a warm spring evening made for a totally delightful experience.  Service was swift.  We wished we had more time to spend here because the brisket stack and Cuban with pulled pork were calling my name."}
{"text":"We had a Sunday brunch at tom's thumb.  It has unique gifts, wine & delicious food. It has a relaxed atmosphere for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I've had a hard time finding great BBQ in Arizona but this place definitely does not disappoint. The baked beans were amazing and the pulled pork was very tasty! The ambiance is also very cute and clean. I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Holy cow the BBQ here is amazing! Great place to stop by after a long hike in the mcdowells. Every time I'm in the area I stop by its sooooo good! I like the BBQ tacos and the St. Louis rib sandwich! The coleslaw and sweet potato fries are amazing too! So cool that it's a gas station, car wash, bakery and bbq all in one! If you're in the Scottsdale area want to avoid going all the way to old town you gotta stop by the thumb! You guys are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Well, appearances do not always tell the story. Nondescript from the outside, the completely transformed Tom Thumb's market is AWESOME. For two weekends in a row, we have walked (yes, walked) there for breakfast. My hubby had been raving about the caprese sandwich (at a gas station?), the cubano and the bbq. We had 'pigs and grits' for breakfast (we split it- huge serving) and it was divine. Beautiful pulled pork smothered in Low Country bbq sauce over creamy grits! Delicious. The following week we split a smoked turkey egg white omelet. It was equally good. Priced well and quite a surprise. The people are very friendly and we will be back. We were so glad this gas station and carwash re-opened. The car wash is professional. When I took my car in for a hand wash, I asked for how long it would take. They told me and hit the time on the dot with no hardsell for other things. Great experience."}
{"text":"Wow what a surprise place!  Excellent service and food!  Highly recommend the sliced Brisket sandwich. Coleslaw is terrible but everything else was really, really good!"}
{"text":"What is not to like at Tom's Thumb Market? Great food, excellent selection of beer and wine and more. Delicious BBQ. No ordinary pit stop. If there ever was a 5 star gas station, this is it."}
{"text":"Amazing food!

The line can be pretty long and seems like there is room for improvement when taking orders but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I have become a regular here - for lunch or dinner.

I called to place a order to go at 11:30AM - simple order full rack of ribs, 2 sides and texas toast - I was told 30 minutes for the ribs (fine no issue)

I get a call back in a few minutes and they tell me 1230PM pick up for the ribs - sure that is also fine

I get there at 1229 promptly and pay. I have the receipt to show what time I showed up at!!! $27 and change.... fine no issue. nice lunch for myself

I am told they will call my name... 22 minutes later @ 12:52PM. I get called - this is SILLY. the kitchen and restaurant are an operational mess. The manager must have no CLUE how to run an operation - watch, observe you can see it for yourself

I had a 1pm conference call to get on and the guy giving me the bag is showing me my food. HELL THEY FORGOT THE SIDES, NO TEXAS TOAST - what did I just pay extra for???? what a complete fustercluck this place has become.

Good food but people get your operation in check, get a good manager and learn how to take care of your customers. I rushed back to the office and got to enjoy COLD ribs at 2pm due to the conference call.

if you tell a customer 1230 then make it 1230 and goodness get the order right. Oh, someone answered the phone to take my order and she actually said, I don't know how to place an order... I am not supposed to answer the phone THEN WHY DID YOU PICK IT UP - DO YOUR JOB! I will think more than twice about a return to the Thumb"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It is a wonderful addition to our little community here. Love that you can grab a little something to eat. My kids adored the waffles. Say they were the best they ever had.  I love a gas station/local gourmet market that has a big beautiful chandelier! Coffee is great. think I'm there almost everyday. This is a great place and still has lots of potential..I'm waiting on the wine! Maybe organic fruits and vegetables would be great as well. Also, maybe more vegetarian options on the menu!
Thanks!"}
{"text":"Your food is fantastic!  Breakfast, lunch and dinner!  PLEASE keep it up!  We live about a mile away.  We LOVE telling people from out of town that we are taking them to a at wash for dinner!!!  Hahahahaha!"}
{"text":"These folks really know how to treat a Veteran . I Went there on Veterans Day and they gave me free car wash and free sandwich. Great work on both. Nice store to brouse and shop."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the Valley!  Out of the way and in a gas station. The brisket is spot on and the pulled pork outstanding!  Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"They do a great job here. They do take a long time but it's worth it. They have good costumer service too. The time I thought something didn't look right they washed it again. It was in the paint. Oh well and not to bad of a price."}
{"text":"It was great because while I was waiting for my car to be washed and detailed, I was able to look around and snack. This place has it all. It's like a high-end gas station and inexpensive prices. I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I gave them my keys to wash and detail my car, but I must say that they not only exceeding my expectations, but I will continually use them when I am in that area. I was able to try some of their brisket and it was delicious. I will definitely be returning to Tom's Thumb!!"}
{"text":"Very simple: BEST bbq in AZ. Period. Worth the drive and adventure to find: kind of hidden away in a gas station but very cool inside. Nice gift shop with unique things to explore. Admittedly enjoyed looking around the shop (they also had some unique freezer and beer selections- example: they had bone broth in the freezer section, kind of cool). As far as food goes EVERYTHING WAS GREAT. Tried the beef brisket and the turkey. Both excellent. Okra was beautiful. Bean rocked. Will definitely make the trek up to the hidden gem of a bbq joint."}
{"text":"This place will amaze you. Great food and service from the grill. Friendly staff.  Far exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Once again I took my car here and they did a great job cleaning my car. Also had lunch and again it was great. The employees are friendly and helpful as always"}
{"text":"Great place. They do a good job of cleaning your car and have friendly service.  I was allowed to come back within 7 days to get the exterior cleaned. I had lost my receipt but had record of it on my bank statement and they made an exception."}
{"text":"Very delicious food, and great service as well! We really enjoyed our ribs, chili, french fries, cole slaw, and pecan pie! It was great to sit outside on the patio. The prices were good too. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I tried the new hamburger with pulled pork.... AMAZING. And the sauces are the cherry on top. They've converted me"}
{"text":"Frickin rich people have all the good stuff! A carwash in Scottsdale is better than the best restaurant in all of Peoria/Glendale (except for Spinatos)(wich Scottsdale also has). \"The Thumb\" as it's called is a hidden gem, well at least it was until \"DDD\" showed up. I had the brisket sandwich and shoe-string fries. It was excellent!  I will definitely swing by whenever I'm on this side of town. I kind of wish I lived near this place so I could drop by all the time. Then again my waist is probably glad I don't. Anyway this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Wow!! My tastebuds are smiling after this wonderful lunch. My husband ordered the brisket sandwich and I enjoyed the Cuban. We both kept \"helping\" out our toddler with his baked Mac n Cheese. Everything is fantastic. can't wait to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. I eat here several times a week. This is the second time they have been out of brisket in a week. Staff cleans plates off tables, however it takes awhile for them to be wiped clean. They serve a few flavors of ice tea, however always seem to be out of at least two. Price is reasonable for quality. Large number of staff, however that is not reflected in the dining room."}
{"text":"This place meets & exceeds expectations!
Free decent wifi, Great quality food, comfortable seating, great beverage options, and a coffee/latte counter, with homemade sweets! 

I drink a lot of coffee and their roast is a bit acidic, but for those who enjoy that bite to their espresso this is perfect!  Carmel lattes, black teas, cold-brew coffee, selection is great for what this spot is! 

Staff are always around but not bothersome.  I often take my laptop and eat and work for a few hours!  Wifi is good, plugs around the room, soda machine is self-serve!  Male manager is always very attentive and friendly, and the gift shop is just adorable!   I've never gotten a car wash here, but otherwise I really enjoy this spot."}
{"text":"This place has the best BBQ in all of the valley. They also have an amazing breakfast menu and is a must visit if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Needs work alot of work  Wine and Beer selection is crap!!  veggies is old not fresh at all and everything is over priced. I will take my money elsewhere and you should too!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, i expected so much more. Bad food and servers that didn't know what they were serving. One of the people with me said it was the worse chicken she had ever had.

Too bad, cute place and great fries, but that isn't enough."}
{"text":"Best bath my car ever had! And I had a great time with the very swell indoor market and the cute new outdoor Saturday market...then I had truly terrific BBQ.  Nice people."}
{"text":"Slipped over the last year. When it first opened, it was fantastic. Since then, its been downhill. People aren't as friendly and the food has become average. Portions seem smaller and quality is not quite there. Still, not awful."}
{"text":"Ok so I ate here a few months ago and I haven't since because of a food issue I had, I don't even want to explain it in detail but when I got my order home I couldn't even eat it I was too grossed out. I decided to give them another chance tonight since its on my way home. I ordered the bbq pulled pork sandwich. When I got home I noticed there was no bbq sauce on the sandwich. I mean that's like the best part! So now I'm eating a dry sandwich and after working 11 Hours all i wanted to do was enjoy my dinner. I will not be going back. Which is sad cause they could be amazing if they paid more attention to the details :("}
{"text":"I'm so impressed with this place!  What a great change up from the norm!  Everything is done so well.  Friendly staff and an awesome carwash!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch!!  Had the cheeseburger sliders, hubby had the BBQ tacos. All were awesome in a very clean gas station restaurant with plenty of seating!!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican Corn in the 85255! Good food and an interesting experience, eating a good quality BBQ or Sandwich at a Gas station!? A must do at least once. BTW the desserts are pretty darn good too."}
{"text":"3 stars for the BBQ (go to Bryan's BMBBQ instead), but 4 stars for just the crazy idea of a carwash BBQ and tons of places to sit and hangout. You should go here once."}
{"text":"The Carolina style sauce for the pulled pork is my favorite I've found in PHX. I'm from GA, and it is very good. Lots of meat served with your meal. They do not short you at all!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. Brisket was awesome very moist and tender. The atmosphere is neat with a gas station country store feel and the staff was very friendly. Corn on the cob with the butter and spices was an interesting combination. Desserts are also good with some interesting choices. Even some made with crushed Girl Scout cookies. Manager talked to us for a long time and had a great time."}
{"text":"The variety and quality of the food is simply amazing.  Service can be a bit slow during peak times But it's a really awesome gas station café!"}
{"text":"I just had the ribs and beans from the Campfire Bistro inside the Market. They were one of the best I've had. The service was great, Ribs were juicy and fall off the bone. The Baked Beans were sweet and tasty!  If you are in North Scottsdale, this is you new BBQ place."}
{"text":"Great place to have your car washed and eat.   The barbecue pulled pork and brisket so delicious.  Definitely be back and don't forget to check out the fish tank, awesome."}
{"text":"We were excited to try  Tom Thumb's especially since we love triple D.  So disappointed - we had the brisket sandwich which was very dry, the aioli sauce was just simple mayo and Texas toast was simply toasted white bread.  Although they did have many kinds of BBQ sauce to try I would have liked the brisket to be more flavorful."}
{"text":"To start, the concept is unique and generates a solid resource for the area. That being said the current kitchen staff needs to needs to be retrained,managed better or a house cleaning may be in order. Quite  a sad sight tonight with bad communication between staff internally. Its always bad when employees dont work together and that visibly spills over into the customers visit. Many people seemed displeased with an assortment of issue's as me and my girlfriend waited for our food. Naturally, when we got home, 5 min later I could  understand why. The quality of pulled pork was far from the par of previous orders, potato salad room temp (danger zone for bacterial growth) and the hold the slaw and pickle didn't deter it from my plate. My girl had a burger with fries, fries cold is a bummer and I know have to deal with her unpleasant self for the rest of the night. Big bummer over all tonight, hopefully things change"}
{"text":"Such a cool place, never knew it was here!  Highly recommend and cant' wait to go back and try breakfast.

Had the BBQ, its was fantastic, and we loved the fact that they have so many sauce choices so that each of us could have it the way we want it!

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The bread was stale and not edible. When I mentioned it to the server she said they were thinking about changing bread vendors because of complaints they were receiving. That did not help me. The barbecue itself was fine, nothing spectacular. The potato salad was very good. My husband ordered the Cuban sandwich and was disappointed by the size of the sandwich for $10.00 it was very small 2 small pieces of ham and a small amount of pork. His bun was also stale and dry. All in all very disappointing, I was going to try the bakery but felt I had given them enough of my money and did not want to be disappointed again"}
{"text":"Tom's Thumb has become our favorite for breakfast, lunch, & dinner! Great coffee bar, quality food, and superior service! Exceeds expectations! Friendly staff...this is one restaurant that is an asset to the community. BTW, we patronize the full-service automotive services, too:)"}
{"text":"This place is top notch and a great addition to the area for a number of reasons.

The gas is cheaper than the nearby Shell and other gas stations. They also have full service too.

The car wash/detail service is excellent -- especially in comparison to everywhere else in the area. My black car looks great after the wash and the hand sprayed polish wax (part of one of the wash packages) keeps the car finish shiny and protected for weeks and through multiple washes. If you have a high end vehicle or just want your car to look great, take it here. A refreshing plus is that nobody here will attack you with high pressure \"deals\" you neither want nor need. 

The food is also excellent. I never expected to be eating regularly at a gas station, but I get food here every few days. They serve all three meals daily. The brisket (best I have ever had), chicken tacos and breakfast tacos (the bacon and egg one is my favorite) are top notch. My kids like the chicken skewers and my wife favors all of their salads. This place has tasty food and is a good value with large portions."}
{"text":"I was excited about the possibility of good BBQ in NoSco.  My excitement was immediately tamed.  The meat? eh, almost tasted like liquid smoke.  The sauce? watered down, the regional stuff(carolina, texas, etc.) didnt even come close.  The price? $30 for 2 sandwiches, sides, and tea?  no thank you.  wont be back."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ, but a little overpriced compared to other places with similar quality."}
{"text":"After buying their smoked meat in a quarter pound for a year, to give my kids, they now refuse to sell a quarter pound.  Manager refused to sell less than a half pound.  My kids don't eat that much.  What trouble is it to this business to sell a quarter pound vs a half?  Poor customer service.  They wouldn't even do it as a one time courtesy. 

Also I noticed on this recent visit that the back entrance has smelly food grease stains all over the sidewalk.  It stinks! And it stinks so bad that the outdoor seating area smells bad too.  Yuck!! Makes me question the cleanliness of the kitchen to see that mess right outside the back entrance. 

Otherwise the food is usually pretty good. But customer service now seems to lacking."}
{"text":"Pigs and grits are awesome, but the toast is ALWAYS cold!  Third visit in a row where we requested hot toast and got cold - food runner even asked this time how the toast was, and when we said it was cold again, she just walked away.  Saw her speaking with the manager, but no response.  Why ask if you're not going to do something about it?  How hard is it to serve warm toast for breakfast with only a few customers there?"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I refer to this place as the fancy gas station. I love the pulled pork sandwich. You can also get your car washed while you have lunch which is nice."}
{"text":"This is one our family's favorite places for so many reasons!!!  They have the best BBQ in town.  Our son plays hockey, so when he has hockey games in Scottsdale, we love heading in to grab a bite to eat in between games.  Their convenience store is stocked up with anything you could ever need and they have the BEST made-from-scratch hot chocolate...which is a necessity at the hockey rink!  Their market is filled with the most personal, unique and fun gifts which make browsing the store for birthdays, anniversaries or the holidays a great experience.  They also have quiet, comfy sitting areas and you can catch us with a beverage on the bench tables up front or in the back on the couches with a good book and relaxing waiting for our next game to start.  We had the pleasure of enjoying Tom's Thumb BBQ at our daughter's high school softball banquet last week.  Their staff is amazing from delivery, set-up, serving to wrap-up and the food was just as good at our banquet as it is in the market.  I highly recommend their catering services.  They are flexible and eager to make any event memorable and delicious!!!  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be so good many months ago but now it has come really inconsistent.  Brisket is often over cooked,and stringy.  The mexicali corn is gross and has little flavor.  The baked mac and cheese has little taste.  Way too expensive for the awful food they are serving now-such a shame."}
{"text":"The Tom's Brisket Stack is delicious! The customer service is great! Because of this, the place gets busy around lunch hour so be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes to get your food. It's well worth it though!"}
{"text":"Oh toms thumb how u disappoint. As a fan of your yummy food, it is sad to see you cutting corners to save a buck. I loved the pulled chicken sandwich until you ruined it by mixing dark and white meat so it costs you less. Not to mention buying cheap cuts of meat that are full of fat and gristle. I had to send my sandwich back because it was so layered in oil I thought it was soup. 

What seemed most strange is your willingness to overstaff. During my meal I watched a seven employees stood around the seating area chit chatting for almost 15 minutes. Then as son as some guy, who I am guessing is the owner, comes in everybody scrambles like cockroaches. 

Anywhoo the food was less than good and I was annoyed by the onslaught of teenagers gossiping instead of doing their job. Not to mention they screwed up my order in the first place and then later took everything from the table when I got up to get more drink despite my stuff sitting inconspicuously on the table. 

All in all I am not real motivated to drive over here anymore. And that sucks."}
{"text":"OK you all made me do it. With all the rave reviews I thought wow so I went.  Maybe because it was a Monday night I should have known better. I ordered the brisket platter and the meat was barely room temp and dry. The really terrific waitress apologized and brought me another portion and it was the same!  Not her fault but I guess you get leftovers on Mondays. I may give the place another try and diffinately on a different day. No excuse for not having hot food. The sides were good and the service great so I gave it 2 stars."}
{"text":"Oh my oh my!  You want your carnivore fix you come here! Very flavorful BBQ! sometimes I'll eat it without the sauce so I can taste the smokey woody flavor.  Can't decide what I like best, the pulled pork or chicken or beef. Just get it all. Of course the sauces are all very interesting too. My kids are actually quiet through our meals here becuz they're busy shovelling the scrumptious mac and cheese into their mouths. Also the little restaurant corner actually has ambience and it's nice to stroll thru the market afterwards."}
{"text":"I'm new to Scottsdale. It is a complete shock to me that one of the best places I keep on returning to since moving here is at a gas station. The food is excellent, the desserts devine! Service is also great, specially the manager. 

Another great thing about this \"gas station\" is the merchandise. It's out of this world!! I can find unusual trinkets & gifts. I also found a scented candle that reminded me of Paris! I'm telling you, this place is a keeper in my books!"}
{"text":"Very over hyped by the national food channel visit. Uncomfortable very crowded seating. Nothing special about the bar b cue, but the prices are high."}
{"text":"Food is AWESOME!!!!!
Great casual Atmosphere
Breakfast Tacos today
Pulled Pork Sandwich the last visit
Also Dee-lish-ous deserts too!"}
{"text":"This is an obscure gas station, BBQ joint, wine bar, bakery, vintage store, and car wash. Whew! 

Food is some of the best of its kind I have had; the Mac and cheese was done really simply. No tomatoes, chicken, jalapeños, truffle oil, bacon on bacon, or anything else that a chef could dream up. Simply, clean, suprisingly light and not over bearing in its flavor. I assume white cheddar and some type of sheets milk white on perfectly cooked pasta. Also indulged in a fruit tart with some of the freshest fri to have tasted at a rest in Arizona. So do yourself a favor, drop the old town scottsdale foodie scene and come up and explore what this place has to offer. 




Gas tends to be more expensive than other place, but I imagine the premium is for the north scottsdale location.


I will be annoying and make this one complaint. This place gets overly crowded even at half capacity. Outside is fine, but while inside you have to meander between tight space of country chic decor being sold and the main lunch counter. Tables are extremely close together and there are an in ordinate amount of bussers (I am counting 6 for a place that has less then 8 people in it now). It can be tough to  navigate between so many bussers, the manager, people paying for gas, and all the patrons. Two people almost collided three times right behind me."}
{"text":"Great food, outstanding service, and a shiny car?  Sign me up.  I have been looking for a quality full service car wash since we moved to Arizona, and am overjoyed by what I found at Tom's Thumb.  After dropping the car off, my daughter raced to watch the fish in the aquarium while I ordered breakfast.  The countless Nemos and Dorys swimming around entertained my toddler while we waited the short wait for the French Toast breakfast sandwich.  We both enjoyed our breakfast and loved the peach cobbler, with a perfect peach to cake ratio.  After breakfast, we enjoyed perusing the many treasures in the boutique.  Lots of cute stuff, and more like a gift shop than a car wash store.  Once we walked out, our car was done, and we drove off in a shiny car inside and out.  I am looking forward to bringing the whole family here.  It is so nice to complete a chore while having a great meal and great service."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and the ratings and we made the trip to Toms'.  Food was tasty well presented and we enjoyed the atmosphere.   We have teenage daughters and rowdy son so the family really enjoyed the opportunity to try something unique and yummy. I heard a lot of locals say it is a big secret.  Tom I highly suggest you advertise a little stronger ....this place is unique and food friendly."}
{"text":"By far, the best barbeque in the Valley!  Kudos on the tomato soup and bistro salad.  They have some real talent in the kitchen.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My first visit was last week with my girlfriends and we had a great meal (pulled pork...awesome).  All of us enjoyed the food, the service and the eclectic atmosphere.  It exceeded my expectations.  As after hearing we were going to lunch place that was attached to a car wash and gas station...well let's say i did not have high hopes.  Boy was i surprised it was great.  I liked it so much went back on Sunday with my husband.  Another great experience.  Great prices and great food.  Try it!!!!"}
{"text":"Would have loved to try the bbq but was sent away from the staff at 6:00 saying they we closing since it was slow. An establishment should always be true to their hours posted.  Especially when you are in a secluded area."}
{"text":"Food here is generally very good... However, the last 2 times I have been here and wanted ribs for dinner they were sold out... A barbecue place sold out of ribs two times in a row? Why even have ribs on the menu if you are not going to make enough?"}
{"text":"I'm so sad because I wanted to love this place so much. We ordered the Pig and Grits. The grits were the consistency of mush and were flavorless. They obviously don't salt or season them when cooking, which is a must. The pork was poor quality. I had a couple of bites that were only fat. My creamy coleslaw wasn't fresh, which was evident by its mushiness. The Mexican corn was charred black to the point it was burned. It was also cold when it came out. The service was very slow and they had not bussed the tables in what looked like a very long time as there were dirty dishes everywhere. The \"sweet\" tea had no sweetness to it. I will say that the sauces were amazing and the Carolina sauce was right on par for authenticity. However, the food just wasn't good enough to go back and for the price, it was a joke.  After checking out the photos, it appears we didn't get the normal quality they offer. My food looked nothing like other pics. Just not sure I can go back though."}
{"text":"Definitely a Jewel in the desert! BBQ is amazing..Loved the Brisket Stack! Unique shopping, amazing food & desserts and detailed Car Wash. To top it it out..a must see Aquarium from the show \"Tanked\". Quite the experience!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!

 Pulled pork and brisket are amazing, whether its on a sandwich or a plate. Great selection of sauces. Fast, friendly service.

Oh, and we got a great car wash too."}
{"text":"First time here and the food is great, pulled pork is my favorite. All the other meats are very good also, had a hard time deciding. Good selection of sauces, liked the extra extra hot. Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"We came here because we saw the reviews and it didn't disappoint. The staff was incredibly friendly and the food was incredible. We were here on vacation and this was by far the best food we had."}
{"text":"Either this restaurant has lost some of the quality I experienced last time I was here, or takeout is not their forte. 

Ordered takeout for 5 pm at 4:15 pm. I ordered off of the menu posted online, which turned out to be fairly outdated from the menu they are now serving. Showed up at 5 pm. Counter staff asked the kitchen to get the  5 pm order ready, and she some type of joshing around response from the kitchen.  End result was order wasn't ready until 5:17 pm. 15 minutes isn't a big deal in and of itself, but a) order was placed well in time, it's just that b) kitchen staff apparently doesn't care about or respect their customers' timeline. The dynamics b/n the counter staff and the kitchen seemed a little off..the woman at the counter was very friendly and trying to provide good customer service, but she seemed to have to play along with a power trip from the kitchen staff.

I ordered a chopped salad, what I got was a green salad, and noticed that chopped salad isn't on the in-house menu anymore.  Ordered pork lolly entree, again, doesn't appear to be on the in house, dinner entree menu anymore and what we got made a pretty sad little meal for the person that ordered it.

The food quality was meh to great. The restaurant appears to be coasting off of its laurels, and maybe the novelty of fine food at a gas station/car wash. My $60+ order was for dinner for folks that newly moved to the area and had never had the food. After the dinner, I didn't recommend the restaurant to them, had to apologize for some of the food, and wouldn't likely go back myself."}
{"text":"As a southerner, it's always hard to find good BBQ out here. A lotta places seem to grill (!?) the meat and throw sauce on it and call it BBQ. Like a lot of the other southerners who wrote a review on this place, I can confirm this is how it's supposed to be done.

First off- yea it's a restaurant/gas station hybrid. This is actually a positive, the enthusiasts will tell you some of the best BBQ you can get is out of shacks/gas stations/ what have you. So yea, reminded me of home. Makes it kinda hard to convince ppl to try until they step inside and see how nice the interior is. There's even a little patio so you can eat outside.

The brisket is my favorite and is def in my top 5. You can see the smoke ring and they top it with onion, pickle, and aioli. I know the aioli is a little untraditional, but hey it's 2014. Personally, I think the brisket is the star of the menu.

Pulled pork is also excellent when I can make myself try something else. So good you don't have to use sauce, which is my preference, but they do provide a selection from all the different BBQ regions (mustard, vinegar, tomato based, etc.) I come here on a regular basis and love introducing ppl to the place, they're always happy I brought them."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here every time I'm in town to wash our truck. Place is great and a must visit for lunch gas and a little shopping"}
{"text":"This place was an absolute gem! You certainly do not expect to find the most delicious food inside a gas station/car wash.  

I ordered the beef brisket and slow-cooked pork platter and was not disappointed. The meat was all very tender and juicy replete with an amazing selection of BBQ sauce to drown your meat in.  Personally, I do not like it when any dish comes out of the kitchen drenched in sauce, so this setup was definitely a plus in my book!  

Come here if you like BBQ and good meat!"}
{"text":"I am extremely dissatisfied with the recent service and food quality at this establishment!

I've been a BBQ customer since they opened a few years ago and while their prices have always been on the expensive side it was worth treating myself to it every now and then. I work nearby and usually recommended this to friends, colleagues, customers, etc. for a great BBQ experience. 

Their food  used to be spectacular when their original chef (Tudie...Trudie...something like that) was in charge, but it has quickly taken a turn for the worst. The \"Brown Bag Special\" has jumped from $8 to $10 and now has a fraction of the pulled pork on each sandwich. What meat was on my sandwich today was dry and burnt to a crisp. Hardly edible. 

Honestly, I never write reviews and hardly ever feel the need to complain about a place. Before writing this review I called and asked to speak to a manager about my visit, the employee told me they were busy but would be with me shortly. After waiting on hold for 5 min, someone picked up the phone and hung up on me- hence this lovely review. 

It's unfortunate, but I don't see another visit to Tom's Thumb happening unless they make some much needed changes. 

TL;DR- The juice isn't worth the squeeze."}
{"text":"The pastries at Tom's Thumb are seriously delicious!  Just looking in the case at all the sweets my mouth was watering.  So of course we ended up getting a big assortment of goodies.  I cannot stress enough, the cinnamon rolls are AMAZING!!  Buttery and delicious!  I also tried the lemon poppyseed muffin and a chocolate chip cookie and both were fabulous.  I would recommend that anyone in the area stop by and stock up on the sweets.  And if I lived closer I'd definitely see chef Kelly about ordering a cake or cupcakes for my next party, all her decorated desserts were just beautiful!"}
{"text":"Grabbed some BBQ here after hiking toms thumb so we were very hungry! Had the beef brisket and potato salad and it's real home cooked BBQ! The gas station setting is unique and inviting !"}
{"text":"Good BBQ
Nice little place to pick up dinner
A little expensive for the food but worth it once in a while.  
The Pulled pork is great. 
Lots of good BBQ sauces"}
{"text":"I tried this place out because it was on DDD. The place is pretty cool and they have a really friendly staff. The reason for the loss of 2 stars is because I thought the food was just okay. It wasn't anything special. I had tomato soup, half a sandwich, and potato salad...the sandwich was good however the soup was cold and the potato salad was very bland. That was a disappointment. The deserts are great though! I do recommend this place just for the deserts."}
{"text":"Wish I could be more enthusiastic - it's a great concept.  

We came for the car wash and decided to have lunch while we waited.  The food was good (BLT w/ egg, sliders, potato salad, etc.) and I thought I had been really clever combining lunch with an hour-long car wash.  My expectation, however, was that after 1.5 hours the car would be at least cleaned competently.  It's brand new, so it really doesn't take much to make it look good.  We got the hand wash ($34.99) just to be on the safe side.  

Unfortunately, after all the wait, it took only an initial glance to realize that our car would have been better off at a high school fundraiser car wash:  bug spots on the hood and bumper, footprints on the door rails, smudge marks on the leather - all things that are easily dealt with - were obviously unattended to.  I pointed them out to the guy with our keys, he swiped his terry cloth over a few spots and then shrugged and said it \"must be one of those days\".  I thought this was funny ... he must mean one of those days when someone gets their car washed at Tom's Thumb and never comes back :)"}
{"text":"The best, friendliest place ever!  Only in Scottsdale can we do car wash, gas, and have an incredible breakfast, lunch or dinner!  And, not just a hamburger, but outstanding food!  If you have not tried their pastries, you are missing a wonderful experience.  Walk in to a clean yummy smelling \"gas station\" and reflect how wonderful our life really is!  Thank you Tom Thumb, you are the best ever!"}
{"text":"Save room for dessert.  I met a friend at The Thumb for lunch last week and the pulled pork and brisket sandwiches were outstanding, the service was friendly, and the remodeled dining area was much more comfortable.  The surprise, however, is in the desserts.  Everything looked good, so we had a difficult time choosing which dessert.  We finally decided to share the apple crisp, which was fantastic, and I took home a single-serving cake with Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies sprinkled in.  It was wonderful."}
{"text":"I ordered the brisket sandwich and a drink.  My attitude about barbecue is that the meat has to have a contributing taste quality without reliance on the sauce.  The meat was cooked properly and had a good texture but lacked sufficient smokiness or depth of taste (If you go light on the smoke, then enhance with a complementary rub).  Once my taste buds got through the sauce the taste was flat.  Good selection of mostly interesting sauces though, but would normally figure this sandwich at a couple of dollars too high considering the level of quality (house-made roll or more complex taste).

Cool menu that has variety in price and tastes.  Nice drink setup with million-flavor Coke machines and a variety of ice teas.  Coffee bar, gift shop, and a car wash...what else could you wish for?

All-in-all it seems popular and interesting, but barbeque is everywhere and to stand out you have to step up and away to be special."}
{"text":"Wait a minute! Gas station, car wash, and restaurant? You've never seen anything like it. Not your father's fillin' station. Quality and class to make this an eclectic oasis. Super selection of wines and beer to enjoy with your food or to take home. (They are happy to accommodate your custom wine order at very affordable and fair prices.) Cool merchandise for you shoppers. Okay...get your car babied while you enjoy some great BBQ (homemade sauces galore on the side), or your favorite coffee done in a Parisian style with a freshly baked good done on premise. Come to Tom Thumb for the experience and stay for the show. Unsurpassed service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great brisket but even yummier sauces, from XXX hot, habanero to multiple kinds of house blend barbecues. I enjoyed my briskets smokiness which was a controlled balance with a super tender outside bark that I enjoyed as much as the meat. Depending on the cut the moist level of the meat can be slightly different however no negative surprises just well crafted southwestern goodness. 

It's been too long and hubby himself being a BBQ virgin, was also quite impressed. He had the cheeseburger but ended up partaking in over half of my dish. Like I told him no risk no reward, so he's learned to at least venture beyond his familiar menu zone, especially when dining in a well documented establishment as Tom's.

As some of you know from my previous posts, being a self-proclaimed potato connoisseur I'm afraid I cant vouch well for Tom's fried shoestrings. Perhaps they spent too much time outside the fryer than in, as the oiliness level and al dente texture wasn't up to par for moi. Thus I'd deduct 0.5 stars for the undercooked spud accompaniment. 

All in all, a good spot to come for casual yet white butcher paper tabletop BBQ cuisine and a car wash/full detail if you so desire."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Wanted to try this place for lunch because it was on DDD. Food was just average and arrived cold. Baked mac n cheese had absolutely no flavor--had to add barbecue sauce for my 6-yr-old to eat it. Lettuce and tomatoes were wilted. The meat on the beef tacos were cold and so were the sweet potato fries. The place was packed, but a lot of people were still eating breakfast. I know I'm not Guy Fieri, but can they serve warm meat at a bar-b-q place? If they keep this up, the next Foodnetwork star that walks through their doors will be Robert Irvine with Restaurant Impossible."}
{"text":"I recently won a gift certificate for Tom's at a charity auction they donated to. I must say I really had no idea what this place was. However, I am now going to be a lifer as it is seriously some top notch BBQ. I tasted everything and the pulled pork comes just simply cooked in it own juices and is extremely moist. The pulled chicken has a sauce blended with it and when I ate it I let it sit in my mouth for a few seconds because my taste buds were setting off firework it was so good. The house made sausage was also some of the best I have ever had. Now I do consider myself a foodie and search out the best in restaurants and I can tell you I have definitely found my new go to BBQ! Thanks Tom's for creating this delicious food!!! There is also a great gift shop and some excellent wine choices with great prices. If you are anywhere near here or passing by it is a must stop!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food! I also love the decoration and ambiance.  The grits and their BBQ are amazing
!!
The employees are very nice.  I also find a great wine selection and the car wash service is great!

5 Stars! Bravo!"}
{"text":"Who'd have thought you could get the best bbq in a gas station? What a yummy surprise! The pulled pork melts in your mouth, the sweet potatoes fries are awesome, possibly the best bbq in the valley! If you haven't tried it yet, your really missing out!"}
{"text":"Love this place for both the car wash and gourmet food as well as unique gifts you can shop for while waiting to get your car back. Highly recommend the burgers!"}
{"text":"Amazing pulled pork sliders & chili. The staff is fantastic. I got a perfect car wash & lunch all in one stop!"}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast and biggest surprise in the trade area.  The flavor profiles, the plate presentations, etc make it worth the trip.  Don't let the fact that it is part gas station, part car wash, part convenience store, that just adds to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a great surprise when we rented bikes and rode past this BBQ!  Had a fabulous lunch with the meat combo, sweet potato fries and Mexican corn!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today, excellent pulled pork sandwich. Also tried the beef brisket, absolutely awesome meal. I would recommend either of those sandwiches. Looking forward to conquer the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"Definitely not the type of food you expect at a gas station. Amazing and delicious food!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Awesome Food and Service. Don't miss this place is awesome. We love coming here. You wait and you can clean your car. Awesome place we love it!"}
{"text":"I brought my daughters here based on other Yelp reviews. We were looking for something different from the regular breakfast place we've been eating at for the last few days during our vacation here; we were very glad we decided to give Tom's Thumb a try! My older daughter got the yogurt and granola (parfait); it was beautiful and came loaded with blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, and raspberries. There was loads of granola and Greek style yogurt layers in a wide parfait dish with a small pitcher of agave syrup on the side. My younger daughter got the side of Mac & cheese (they serve lunch all day!) and it was more than she could eat! Very creamy and cheesy. I ordered the breakfast tacos (with beef brisket for $2 additional charge). I got two VERY full small flour tortillas filled with scrambled eggs, potatoes, cheese, and of course pieces of brisket; there was some pico de gallo, shredded lettuce, and 2 small cups with sour cream and salsa on the plate as well. Everything was fresh and delicious, the staff was awesome, and we're going back this afternoon for some pastries! Try it you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"What a cool place!  BBQ/Country Store/Gas station... had the soup and sandwich combo for lunch and it was great.  It was busy, so expect the food to come out slowly.  We didn't have a ton of time to stick around and explore the shop but I will be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I was so confused at first, but this place was great.  We just moved to Scottsdale from Cleveland, OH and our cars got in last night.  After a week on the car transporter, they were disgusting to say the least.  We asked around for the best place to get a car wash (my car is my baby) and the consensus was here.  My wife and I both get our cars done around lunch and go in to pay.  

So we get inside and we see a bakery and a full-on BBQ joint?? Not a normal car wash. We are starving so we decide to eat while our cars are being washed.  I'm from TN and very particular about my BBQ and this was pretty good 'que. Sauces were good overall but the BBQ mustard was by far the best!  That rivals many places in Memphis. 

Overall a great experience and we will definitely be regulars!"}
{"text":"Five star restrant ! I came here after going to the pool . The food was delicious . It felt like six things in one . AMAZING DELICIOUS PERFECT"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Definitely will return. Ribs were great! Having moved to the valley a little over two years ago from Chicago I have been searching for ribs and quality barbecue. I think I've been everywhere. But I was nowhere until I found the Thumb. The ribs were outstanding as were some of the sides. However for taking home the shoestring potatoes really didn't make it. I would definitely go back and especially eat on site."}
{"text":"I have been eating and getting my car washed at Tom's Thumb since they opened. Their fresh BBQ dishes are to die for not to mention the fresh and tasty BBQ sauces which make your food pop. The customer service in the restaurant and car wash line are First Class."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! The brisket salad was amazing, although I think I'd do smoked chicken next time, brisket is too fatty for me, but I think that's how brisket is supposed to be. Smoked flavor was fantastic! Baked Mac n cheese is creamy and delicious! Casual  atmosphere with fun shopping. Loved this place!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT! This was our first time here and I must say it was a great experience. While waiting in line to order, the GM Mike introduced himself and offered us samples of the meats they make. All were exceptional which made it easy to order because we knew we couldn't go wrong. Service was great and our pulled pork sandwiches along with their sweet potato fries were delicious. We will definitely return for more (can't wait to try more items from the menu) and recommend Tom's Thumb Fresh Market to anyone who wants to experience exceptional barbecue!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!!! So far, I have tried ribs, tacos, sliders, sweet potato fries, shoestring fries. Everything tastes great! Friendly staff. A little tricky to find it for the first time, since it is a part of a gas station, and the sign was not much visible for me. But despite the fact, the great food keeps me coming back there."}
{"text":"I've been to Tennessee and Texas where bbq is outstanding. This place was rated low because it didn't have any flavor. Yes, it was tender but it just didn't do it for me. I have to say the bbq sauce was very good but you shouldn't have to drench your meal in bbq sauce to make it flavorful. Also ordered the mac n cheese . . . Again it was lacking something. I loved the atmosphere of the place but this was not the place for me."}
{"text":"It's never much fun to go to the orthopedic doctor unless his office is next door to Tom's Thumb, a fun, casual place for good food.  I only wish they would serve breakfast all day."}
{"text":"Terrific ribs, mediocre cole slaw.  Good service and it was a beautiful evening last Friday night when we ate there, outdoors.  I'm a Minnesotan and eating outside in mid-October was a treat.  Really, how many places can you have a nice meal while you get your car washed?  I ask you.   I would go back in a heartbeat but don't know that I'll ever go to Scottsdale again (my family member there died and we were in for a funeral service.  :-(

BEST part:  I swear on all that holy and pure that our waiter was either Mark Bittman or his long lost twin!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Slow. Average quality. Unhealthy. Nuff said."}
{"text":"An experience in itself and well worth the stop over to browse and eat while waiting for your car wash.  I had a delicious BLT with egg. And the detail on the car wash was fantastic. Five dollar coupon in yelp to top it off for the car wash!"}
{"text":"I've had several items here and they're all fantastic. Haven't been able to find a tomato bisque yet that compares with theirs. Must stop if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Tom's Thumb is delicious! I'm from the southeast and I love BBQ. Tom's Thumb has great food and several sauces to choose from, so you can change your flavor somewhat, depending on your mood. Their flavors are on the stronger side and zesty. If you prefer a lighter flavor, you're in luck because most of the meats are served without sauce and you can dress them yourself - the Sweet Baby James sauce is a more light and liquid sauce. The ribs are fall-off-the-bone, cooked just right. They run out of ribs early, so you have to keep that in mind if you go there at night. Their collard greens are my favorite. Also keep in mind that some websites say that they close at 9pm on weekends, but we experienced that they really close at 8 (I'm not sure about weeknights). The car wash and gift shops are added bonuses. They have a really great selection of greeting cards, too. They also have bakery sweets and pre-made sandwiches, if you're just filling up with gas and in a hurry. The manager chatted with us while we ate BBQ once and showed us that they really have the small town friendliness that we value. All in all, I would highly suggest a visit!"}
{"text":"Today I tried the brisket stack for breakfast and it was so beyond awesome I'm still thinking about it hours later.  Smoky brisket on a crispy potato pancake topped with chipotle aioli, probably the best breakfast ever.  We also tried the stuffed french toast which was outstanding.

Please please please add the brisket stack to the regular breakfast menu!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite meals. Had the brisket stack which was fantastic. The brisket was amongst the best smoked brisket I have had, fresh perfectly cooked eggs, and great sauce. Service was super friendly."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, I used to order from the food counter quite a bit but my same old order seemed to keep changing how it was made (Bistro Salad). I've had some of the barbeque before, being that I'm from Texas I have pretty high standards but it was still okay! My deductions are for the issue with continuity, slow service, and the not so friendly staff. The manager there (tall guy with glasses) is always super nice! But everyone behind the counters seems like they are always in a terrible mood, and that I'm bothering them by being there. I'm going to give it some time before I go back..."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about this place. It's a cozy, neat little spot. The staff here are courteous, professional and attentive. They provide a clean environment to eat in and good customer service. The food here is outstanding. After the first time I came here, I had to come back a day later just because I couldn't stop thinking about the food I had! I'm usually very timid to try new foods, but I don't feel so nervous here because I trust and know myself that this place has good food. I've recommended this place to friends and family and they've also become repeat customers to this place. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We placed a catering order for 50 guests. The pulled pork and brisket were amazing. The corn on the cob and beans were very good. We ordered creamy coleslaw which was extremely salty, as if someone accidentally dumped cups of salt in it. Overall very good."}
{"text":"I needed to top my oil off. They don't sell motor oil here. At a gas station? Really?"}
{"text":"I get a chuckle every time I walk into this place, but the food is great.  We've had the convenience store in a car wash with a comfortable waiting area here in the Valley before.  But this place brings it to a whole new level.  Excellent Smoked Brisket, Pulled Pork, and Pulled Chicken, The Sauces are excellent, but my favorites are the Hickory, the Chipotle, and the North Carolina mopping sauce... You can even buy some Hickory wood to bring home that Hickory smoked flavor. I brought along my friend from Texas who thinks all BBQ in the valley is terrible, and only Texas can do it right... He even gave this place his Texas stamp of approval.  So, Bring your hot rod, fill it up with 100 Octane Race Fuel out of a regular pump, get your car washed by guys who look like they belong on a Pit Crew, browse the store for a craft beer, or bottle of wine and enjoy a very excellent Pulled Pork Sandwich (Bring your dog too when it's nice outside as they even have that covered) You too will walk away with a chuckle and smile on your face."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. Despite being in a gas station with a car wash the eating area inside and out is relatively nice. Service was a little slow, not a quick in and out."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner tonight and got the Bleu Brisket Saled... I'm mean come on the grilled chicken salad is the bomb so I don't even know what to call Bleu Brisket salad but even better!!! I added craisins to it with the balsamic dressing and oh my gosh. Ryan was in the kitchen tonight and made it RIGHT YO!!!... And our waitress CATHY who we've only had 1 time before remembered exactly what we got the one time before. Now that's good customer service. Give them a raise Michael L.  Lol..."}
{"text":"The Thumb,  as seen in Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives (DDD) was crowded, even at a later lunch hour.   This place is touristy, but the barbeque is very tasty.   We ordered pulled pork sandwiches, and an Andouille sausage sandwich,  with additional sides of potato salad and vinaigrette slaw. The sides both had hints of dill.  The BBQ Bar has a selection of sauces,  from Kansas City style to spicy Habanero.  There is seating inside and outside.  Like places in Texas,  this location has gas pumps to fill up your car, or wash it!

Dessert is available from Thumb Bakery.   If you have forgotten something on your road trip, you may likely find it in their market."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the car wash is excellent and the shopping in the little market is super fun to explore. It's a gem hidden in what looks like just a gas station."}
{"text":"The BBQ brisket and pulled chicken platters were very tasty. My wife got the slaw and fries as sides and I had the BBQ baked beans and slaw. What I like about this food is the unique flavors. It's good BBQ but they use other seasonings. I think I picked up an apple flavor in the beans and they were awesome. The slaw was more of a vinegar base, not mayo and it was very crisp with more cucumbers, peppers and sweet onions than cabbage. The brisket was tender and not too dry. I added some Memphis and Chipotle sauces to mine. Service for carryout was done quickly and with a smile. 

Now, the only reason I can't give 5 stars is ordering from my phone was more cumbersome than other sites. For example: ribs don't show up on the carryout menu -- so I didn't think they had them as I had never visited the store before. They'd sell much more if the mobile menu was more complete. My wife couldn't even view the menu on her iPhone 5s. If you're coming down the 101 and you're looking for something different in town - exit and try Tom's Thumb. Gas up, get the car in suds and enjoy some smoked meats."}
{"text":"Offers a nice cozy atmosphere. I've been here a handful of times and have never been disappointed. Food is always exceptional!"}
{"text":"Great food and experience.  General Mgr (Mike) was front and center asking people if he could help them decide what to order so when they got to the counter they knew what to order.  

While we waited, he chatted with us, gave us the history and a sample!  Terrific all around. Highly recommend a visit.  The smoked chicken was a tasty surprise!"}
{"text":"This place has a great environment and excellent food!! The staff and manager are really good as well. Just be prepared to wait for your food. Small kitchen and it takes 25 mins + to get food. Other than that great choice."}
{"text":"Great brisket sandwich as claimed. Weird that it's a gas station/ hipster bbq lunch spot/ hallmark store carwash."}
{"text":"If you love BBQ, pulled pork,  or brisket then this is the place for you.  I have tried several items on the menu; cuban sandwiches, the three piggies (pulled pork slider) and the chicken tacos.  All were amazing.  They have a variety of BBQ sauces which add a ton of flavor to any dish.  The menu is pretty extensive and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Just driving by you would never know that this gem is inside.  Tom's Thumb bbq is one of my favorites!  I crave it frequently.  The brisket stack it to die for, the pigs n grits are another favorite - will usually get that for breakfast.  My son loves the pulled pork sliders.  Over the summer they were only open until 8.  Now it's 9 so I get a little more time on my way home from work."}
{"text":"I work near this establishment and have been a patron for several years.
I had hoped that the recent renovations would make this place much more conducive to lunch time meals for me and my coworkers.  Unfortunately, that's not the case.
While they may have improved several aspects of the seating arrangement, I still stood in line for 15 minutes last Friday trying to place my order.
They appeared to only be running two cash registers at a time on a sporadic basis and unless you're a Scottsdale stay-at-home mom who has time wait in between yoga and your massage, this place isn't a good fit for lunch time meals.
The food is still good, but who has time to enjoy it when you have to inhale it for fear of being late for work."}
{"text":"Great little gift shop within the gas station. 

BBQ seems very popular but as a vegetarian I did not try it. They also have a bakery with cupcakes which I have yet to try.

Gas prices are around a dime higher than most other places."}
{"text":"The outside of this place gives no indication of the surprising eclectic inside. We enjoyed the most fantastic delicious BBQ. I absolutely could not get enough of the brisket. There are plenty of sauces to choose from but I didn't even need any. And there is even shopping and bakery treats. You have to check this place out."}
{"text":"Holy cow this place is good! I'm on my DDD tour, and this BBQ did not disappoint! I had the brisket sandwich. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is the third time in 2 months when our meat platters were very dry. We arrived at approx 5:30 pm each time including tonight and had hoped for the original melt in your mouth meat.  Disappointed once again."}
{"text":"Just had the pig & grits there and it was very tasty. They have a large menu to chose from. This place is a one of a kind, and a must try."}
{"text":"My friend saw this on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives and insisted we go.  She's a big foodie & never wrong so I knew it would be amazing.  I Loved it!  

My friend had a brisket egg breakfast thing (with the extra fatty option) - she said the taste was to die for.  I'm more of a healthy choice kinda girl so I stuck with the bbq shredded chicken sandwich - that was super juicy & delicious.  Definitely healthier than the brisket and I still was able to try some of their famous bbq sauce.  Yum!

They have a drink machines that offers anything you could want.  Love the green tea brew.  

The interior is a cool vibe.  (Inside a gas station) but it's totally fun!  Lots of seating.  Killer must see fish tank!

People are cool, friendly."}
{"text":"Mike and Bill made it right. 
I came back to Tom's Thumb last night and wasn't disappointed.
I already wrote about the super nice staff and excellent attentive service. 
This time the food was great too. 
The hamburger was good, their new bisque soup was to die for. It's not on their menu yet, but I bet you can ask for it. 
The best part was the beef brisket blue cheese salad. great flavors and a very generous portion. 
I will be coming back."}
{"text":"We loved it and we'll definitely be back! Mike was so kind and helpful on what to have and the food was amazing! We loved it all! The store has everything you could imagine! From furniture and art to soaps, lotions and throw pillows! You can also gas up and get a carwash! Great place to bring guests from out of town. We highly recommend The Thumb!"}
{"text":"This confirms what most of you prolly already know: YOU DON'T GET SERVED THE SAME FOOD AS (fat)GUY FIERI!!  Another failed attempt to find quality BBQ anywhere other than my grill or smoker.  For $21 you get cold pulled pork (1/2 fat), and two slabs of brisket that might have been good in it's prime, plain Jane sides, and cornbread that tastes like canned, creamed corn.  To top it off, you have your choice of sweet & flavorless \"Memphis Mop\", or spicier, but equally flavorless \"Sweet Baby James\" BBQ sauces.  You done  ol' James Taylor wrong on that one folks!  Fine song, turned liquid diahrrea, masquerading as  BBQ sauce.
Pulled pork has minimal smoke penetration, while the brisket goes the other direction, and pushes the limits of tasteful smoke.
Tater salad and coleslaw are cafateria grade, at best.  Love the pickle chips with the \"authentic\" stem end(?!?!).  Do people really eat this stuff?
If you can look past the BBQ, you can also enjoy some thoroughly milquetoast bottled beers.  Oh boy.  
If all of this isn't enough to lure you in, you can sit outside in the parking lot cum \"patio\", while some aging hair metal band from the 90's belts out \"Cherry Pie\" at some nearby festival.  Goes great with the house speakers playing Hotel California, all the while.
This is if you still have any hearing left, after the hordes of ear-busting, Harley-riding, yuppies, flog their throttles endlessly, 10 feet away (prolly to keep the POS's running).

Ignore DDD, and anything Guy has sold his soul to endorse (including his OWN restaurants!), and get some local input, before taking the \"dive\".

What a bummer.  Place is kinda cool/offbeat, and you can gas up  and wash the G-ride when to finally decide to throw down your napkin, and leave a pile of uneaten food on the table.

Like Glenn said \"We are all just prisoners here ... of our own device\" ...."}
{"text":"I had never been here before for a carwash...probably won't go back. Most probably go for the food. Car wash didn't even get off the bugs off the front of the car even after the employee took a brush to it. Confusing for first time users, not clear where to pull up and pay. Employee had to run my $ into the store. But I guess they like it that way so you are forced to eat or shop!"}
{"text":"Yummmy is an understatement!!! 
Brisket sandwich was amazing!! The Mac and cheese , cole slaw, pulled pork and the staff were great!! I love the store, and the bakery attached!! Definitely Christmas shopped! It was crowded even at 2pm on a Saturday !!! 

Definitely worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"Love coming to this place for a car wash! Dave at the front check in is always nice and professional. He educated me on all the different types of car washes and was very patient. This place can get busy but luckily they have an amazing barbecue restaurant inside. The food is amazing and is worth the wait at times! 

With great service and food, This is the best carwash in town!

Thanks again Dave! 

-Leo"}
{"text":"Wow, what took us so long to try this place. Sometimes with places that have been on DDD the experience can be a let down. Not the case with The Thumb. We ordered takeout and sampled a wide variety of options. We loved the different cuts of meats, tacos didn't transfer well to go just as an FYI. Definitely coming back here soon though!"}
{"text":"Tom's Thumb rocks!   The food is consistently delicious.  I frequent quite a bit and they have the most amazing ribs, sliders, fries and baked mac n'cheese.  They offer quite an array of BBQ sauces to satisfy any taste.  I also love the breakfast sandwich...egg BLT...fabulous combo!  You may have to wait a little bit because they make the food to order but it's fresh that way and worth it.  The atmosphere is very eclectic and not what you would expect given it has a carwash and gas station.  The entire staff is super friendly and make you feel so welcome.  The gift shop has such fun and unique items.  You could spend an hour easy browsing around.  I'd be remiss not to mention the bakery and all the decadent treats they have from donuts to cookies and cupcakes to cinnamon rolls and macaroons.  Try their snickerdoodle cookies.  They are the best!  

Tom's Thumb is also is a big supporter of Girl Scouts!  They participate in the annual GS cookie challenge and support local troops to host booths.  

I really can't say enough about this local gem.  Check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"We arrived 20 minutes before it was supposed to close and they were already cleaning up and unwelcome.  The unfriendly young woman at the front was not impressed with us showing up. She rattled off everything that was not available like ribs and brisket of all kinds as she rolled her eyes. My kids ordered something then when they didn't have my umpteenth selection, I said cancel our order, we are not staying. They were unapologetic, rude, and uncaring. If you say you are open to 8, then you should be open to 8. We will never go again. I will tell our concierge about the bad service as well."}
{"text":"What a total disappointment this place was. We travel a lot and try to visit the places featured by Guy On DDD. The service was horrible, just about had to ask for everything, including silverware  and the food was barely average. For B B Que I have actually had better from chain restaurants IE Lucielles, Famous Daves etc. Save your money and time, head elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. I was in the area attending a conference, and read great reviews on this restaurant. Also learned that it was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives, so decided to check it out. The owner is awesome, personally explaining the menu and taking care of us like royalty. After selecting what turned out to be some of the best BBQ I've had, they even sent samples to our table. While it is funny to say you are going to dinner at a combination gas station/car wash/ restaurant, you will not regret it. \"Thumbs Up\"!!!"}
{"text":"The Thumb has great food it is definitely one of my favorite places for breakfast. Yet this morning my sever Koleen was very unpleasant. She didn't seem to care at all about being kind or welcoming to guests and to me that is a very big deal. Now I am very hesitant about returning just because I feel like I should go somewhere that deserves my business."}
{"text":"Best Pulled Pork sandwich in scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while traveling thru area and having heard about the Thumb :  after stuffing menu for a while decided on chili , brisket stack and Mexican corn. First will say from someone in bbq joints all over America this is the funkiest you can image .. fish tanks, 50's diner, carwash, bakery, gift shop, gas station, coffee shop, etc.(somehow it works)
The food.. chili is all meat no beans and probably the best I have tasted. Brisket by itself would have been a little better than average but in the stack was a top notch dish and while I would not return for just the brisket will definitely return if in the area for the dish.. the Mexican corn was good but I would not say the best I  have had. There are so many choices it is hard to decide so can't wait  to stop in again.."}
{"text":"It is the best BBQ in Phoenix!  Amazing food - awesome atmosphere - friendly service!  My favorites - you would never think to order catfish at a BBQ but it is the bomb!  The Cuban is by far extra yummy and the brisket is always delicious.  Oh and the fries are the best!  We always take guests who come into town and we say hey well eat at the gas station and of course you get that look until they experience the deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Omg the brisket does not disappoint. Amazing food amazing service. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"The food is good but not sure if it is all that great for how long you have to wait to get it.  I been ordered there more than once and each time the service is slow."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  My son recommended this from a TV show (Dive, Dines & Drive-Ins) so we tried it tonight.  Outrageous prices, tasteless Bar-B-Q and side dishes.  My brisket was very fatty and had little taste, especially no smoke flavor at all.  The pulled pork was very fatty and not much taste. The prices were higher than most 4 star places I've been.  I guess we paid for the \"fame and name\".  Definitely would NOT recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Words cannot begin to describe how much I LOVE the corn on the cob! Wow! Came here once for a car wash/detail and was starving so tried some BBQ. Smoked meat is fantastic and the Mac n cheese is a must!"}
{"text":"I am always in a rush when I come here but they have awesome food and super cool items to buy!! We found this place before it was super busy and loved that this find was close to our office.

Favorites: pulled pork sandwich, black & blue burger and the blue brisket salad.  Love all of these!! 

Sorry so short gotta go back to the office!!"}
{"text":"OK, can I just say that this place actually exceeded all the hype I had heard? You may have driven by this gas station/ car wash/ market/ restaurant if you were in the WestWorld area, and not even know you were missing out on the best tacos ever.  Trust me, I'm Mexican, and my family ran a restaurant growing up so I KNOW GOOD TACOS. While BBQ tacos are not typical at your average taco stand, they are truly delicious. I mean juicy, and the perfect combination of sweet, salty, and spicy.  

I had heard it was really nice inside, and I was still pretty taken back when I walked in.  The dining area had a chandelier and linen tablecloths!  Who knew a gas station eatery could be romantic and classy? Such a pleasant surprise to come across this place, y'all seriously gotta check it out."}
{"text":"Great food but the service is so bad it's almost funny. ALMOST. I don't know of it's worth waiting for my food and having to ask constantly for refills. I would try it once but I don't recommend coming back for seconds."}
{"text":"Great barbeque!  I really enjoy the variety of barbeque sauces that are available.   A little pricey, but, if you want to treat yourself, well worth it.  Pulled pork is excellent.   Juicy, charred, very tasty.  I am going back!"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ!!! Went there around 3pm there was no line. Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"First of all - I am new to this social media thing. I stumbled across this gas station in Scottsdale on the way to the Good Guys Car Show.  Let me tell you - give this place a try. The BBQ is first rate. The bakery - made fresh daily. I went back the next day for the cinnamon rolls. Gifts, wine, car wash - they have it all!

They are extremely busy, it seems all the time. Get there early if you want ribs as they ran out on Friday night. Clean place, nice staff, oh yes homemade BBQ sauces...my favorite is the Mean Mr. Mustard. 

Anyway - I am rambling, just give them a try, you'll be pleasantly surprised all this is in a gas station!

Ken."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Portions were rather skimpy on the brisket sandwich. Good meat pile but it was small. Although it's great tasting and nice atmosphere. Wine selection is pretty impressive!"}
{"text":"Go here often for the car wash but decided to have lunch today.  We asked for the 'moist' brisket when given the option between lean and moist.  Turned out that moist was mostly fat, thin, pieces and not very much meat - so that was a bit disappointing.  The person I was with complained that he couldn't eat his, so they swapped it out with lean - which was dry.  We wished there was something in between.

The sauces were awesome, corn bread was nice and fluffy and a bit sweat, and Mexican corn was very flavorful, sweet, and moist.

Overall a low 4 stars because of the brisket."}
{"text":"After seeing this on ddd we decided to check it out.  We came at 11am on a Sunday. It was busy but not to bad. They were out of waffles, grits and yogurt though.  We tried the 14dollar brisket stack.  It was ok. The brisket was bland as it was reheated.  The egg wasn't runny but stiff.  The potato was oily.  The sauce was great.  Overall it was just ok."}
{"text":"Delish! Fun shopping also. Great service every time. Plus they have RACING FUEL,,,,, go. here. now. :)"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised when we entered.  We had heard about Tom's Thumb, found ourself in the area and thought we would try it for lunch.
The pulled pork sandwich is very good, tender meat and plenty of it.
if you order fries ask for them to be made fresh.
Many articles had mentioned their baked mac and cheese so we tried it.  I would give it a three out of five only because it had a little too commercial taste to the cheese, but it came in a cast iron skillet with a nice crust on the top.
Service was good, individuals behind the register were knowledgable about their products.  
Two ways to eat - order and take out to eat \"wherever\" or outside the fresh market, or sit down and get served.  We elected to be served.  The sit down area is small, but adequate for the number of people who select that option."}
{"text":"Awesome hidden gem bbq! Great menu items, prices and fun spot to check out. Pissed they stop selling their macaroons on a daily basis because they make everything fresh daily and I guess they weren't profitable enough to keep doing that (bring them back anyway !)"}
{"text":"This Is a great lunch spot for a meeting that would benefit from other atmosphere conversation stimuli and topics.. Lots of great unique things to look at inside.. The brisket is what tops this place off, I get the brisket on a bun with fries and the assortment of different sauces to put on everything is fantastic! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This is our go to most weekends. My husband is not a big breakfast person, I am and we both win here!

I rotate between the 2 egg breakfast and the breakfast tacos. He is just there for one thing, The Stack!!"}
{"text":"Saw this place for the first time on \"Diner's, Drive-Ins and Dives\".  It LOOKED marvelous, so our next trip to Phoenix, we made a determined effort to eat there.  Well,  Guy, not sure what happened, but it wasn't the best we have had.  The pulled pork and beef was good, had true smoky, barbecue flavor.  What WAS NOT good was the cole slaw.  It was warm, oily, and no flavor.  Plus, you only received chips with your $8.99 sandwich???  We did love the different barbecue sauces, and I loved the fact that they served sliced onions and pickles chips with the sandwich.  Would I return???  No.  The store is fun to shop in and there are great desserts offered on the way out.  Friendly staff, lots of mannequins that look like customers, and genuinely \"fun\".  Fix the cole slaw...please.  Also, for $3.00...the quantity of French fries could be larger."}
{"text":"I've probably eaten at Tom's Thumb about 10 times now and every time is absolutely bomb! They must raise and kill the animals in the back I swear the food is so fresh. The staff is always friendly and organized. They've got a wide variety of food on their menu that is all very good. Their breakfast menu is awesome. You can't go wrong with going here!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and it was delicious. Had the chicken tacos, as I am not a fan of pork. They were very good. Also stole a few fries from my friends plate and loved them. :) my only complaint was that the tortillas did get a bit mushy while consuming.. But that wasn't completely unexpected. Also tried the chipotle barbecue and a couple others and liked them. All had a little something different to offer. Had the Nutella cupcake tonight--as i was too stuffed to cobsider after lunch and I was definitely a fan. Will return!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews we decided to try out this place last week. While the presentation of the restaurant is great when you walk in, it's def nicely decorated and kitschy since it's adjacent to a gas station, I'm not sure what everyone is raving about as far as the food.

Unsure of the portions we decided to split the cheeseburger and brisket sandwich. There wasn't really anything special about it as we found the brisket tough to chew and the cheeseburger just ordinary and nothing to write home about. If you order the brisket even sliced I felt I had to saw the brisket into small easy pieces to swallow and this is a task as you only have plastic utensils to do it and in a small basket. While there was a little BBQ sauce bar by the drink section, I believe that good BBQ and brisket doesn't need to be smothered in sauce to taste good. The only thing we didn't try and maybe it could of upgraded our experience was something from the dessert case. Nice and clean establishment but I've had much better."}
{"text":"After reading the glowing reviews and then recommended by a friend, we decided to get takeout on a Monday evening.   We had high hopes for a tasty dinner.  We were underwhelmed and very disappointed with the food. I ordered pulled pork with vinegar slaw and baked beans.  The pork was dry, tasteless and loaded with big chunks of fat, the vinegar slaw didn't  have a trace of vinegar and wasn't fresh, the only saving grace were with the beans which I poured over the pork to make it palatable.  The pulled chicken had some flavor and was a little better than the pork but not by much.  Maybe it was a different chef, maybe it was the wrong night of the week, maybe we ordered the wrong thing but we definitely won't be back.  There are much better bbq restaurants around town that leave this place in the dust."}
{"text":"We finally gave this place a try and we are glad we did.  We ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries, slaw and baked mac and cheese.  The fries, oh em gee they were so good!  It is my favorite of all fries so far.  The sandwich was very good with the hickory sauce which is their mildest sauce.  I also tried the ToTo sauce but it was too spicy for me which is not saying much because I prefer my spice level at zero.  The slaw and mac n cheese were decent but nowhere near as good as the fries.  The people were very friendly.  We will be going back to dine in.  They have a great selection of wine and beer."}
{"text":"I have gone to a few places for car washes and it is never good. The thumb was perfect and so was the price. Not only that, you can grab delicious BBQ while you wait. We will be definitely going back for the car wash and the food! Great service as well. We had to wait for a little bit, due to the amount of customers, but it was totally worth it!!! And that goes to show you what a great place this is!"}
{"text":"I try to make it to Arizona twice a year (if I am lucky), and every time I go Tom's Thumb Fresh Market is always a priority to stop by! I found Tom's Thumb because I always go to locations shown on DDD (Diners, Drive In, and Dives) during my travels. 

My first visit I had to have the special that Guy made (the brisket sandwich) but a normal Jenna meal would have been their mac and cheese entree. It was actually very hard making the decision the first time, but I could not stray away from my DDD. So before even leaving New Jersey, I knew what I would be ordering when I got to Tom's Thumb... the mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was AH-MA-ZING! The perfect blend of cheese in a cask iron dish and I was able to add a meat, so I added chorizo which was the perfect pairing of spice to this traditional dish that I love.

I brought my entire family this time (party of 9) and everyone was raving (as I knew they would) about their meal. My father is still talking about their famous brisket sandwich. To finish our meal, we split two cupcakes from their bakery. It was the perfect sweet treat to a delicious meal; you could tell they were freshly made.

Tom's Thumb Fresh Market is a must try in the Scottsdale area. It is quaint, surprising (who would think GREAT food at a car wash/gas station) feel-good barbecue joint. Mike and his team have something great going on and they won't diappoint. If only they could deliver to Jersey?!"}
{"text":"Wait... This is a gas station. Wait... This is a car wash. Wait... This is a restaurant? No way! I had a client request a business meeting and she recommended this place. I hadn't been here before, so I went to Facebook to see if my friends had experienced it. Apparently their BBQ pork sandwich is amazing. It. IS! I ordered that, had a few sides of BBQ sauce, some fries and was set. It was an amazing dining experience and I can't wait to go back. Oh, and the place was packed. Talk about a hidden gem!!!"}
{"text":"They sell out of the ribs fast and the service is slow, but if you are willing to wait... the food is VERY VERY good."}
{"text":"Excellent! 

Discovered this place right after they opened and was thrilled with all the BBQ options. I've been about 15 times now and haven't had any issues with service or food quality. I brought some BBQ back to work and now my whole office goes at least once a week too. I usually get the BBQ Tacos or BBQ Brisket. Their Corn is great as well! If you feel like eating there, they have a great patio and you can get your car gassed and washed while you eat. 

Any Midwest BBQ fans out there, try Toms Thumb!"}
{"text":"Just around the corner from our place and we love it! BBQ and 100 octane for a good time. Get the Mexicorn and thank me later. Great Staff and very clean. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Took the whole family yesterday for supper. This place has awesome food. BBQ taco's were good, brisket was great. We kept ordering & ordering. My dad kept getting side dishes from menu. Everything was great. What a great family place. On a side note, they have a nice selection of craft beer's to take home w/you. We'll definitely be back to this place so I can hear my wife say \"are we eating at the gas station again?\""}
{"text":"The evening we arrived in Phoenix, we turned on our TV to find some blonde idiot in sunglasses stuffing his face with what looked like pretty good barbecue. We were passing by on the 101 so we thought we'd call in and try it.

Between us we had a Cuban, a pulled pork sandwich, a brisket sandwich, pigs and grits and a bowl of chilli.

The meats were great and the accompaniments were great - really complimented the main features. The choice of sauces is great too.

The kids were overwhelmed by the computerized touch screen soft drink machines, and managed to find some truly unpleasant combinations such as raspberry root beer and orange ice tea coke.

The atmosphere is pleasant too with comfortable, casual seating.

All in all a great place that I'm sure we'd frequent regularly if we lived nearby."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the concept! High end car wash, detail center, but it does not stop there. As others mentioned, the BBQ is very good, but to have 5 homemade BBQ sauces that are all unique? Get OUT! We have been here 3  Sundays over the past month since finding out about this place through YELP! 

Get the pulled pork. It is awesome!
I have also had the Eggs Benedict and it was also wonderful.

The deserts are also VERY GOOD and VERY FRESH! I love the lemon bar. It is a standout favorite for me. 

When my folks come in to visit in December, Tom's thumb will be on the docket!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  We enjoyed the \" Toms Brisket Stack\" and the \" Pulled Pork Sandwich\".  For sides we had vinegar slaw, and the mexicorn.  Everything was absolutely delicious and was served up quickly.  The only exception was the mexicorn which I felt was overlooked.  It appears they boil the corn and then put it on the grill.  It was just a little old to me.
The general manager came over and ask if everything was good, and so did 2 other ladies.  Very friendly and a great experience from beginning to end."}
{"text":"Great breakfast with a mimosa! 
Highly recommend this place.
In my best Schwarzenegger voice...\"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"The food is excellent, but we seemed to arrive on a discombobulated Saturday night. Apparently their printer was out of order; one customer arrived for her take-out order only to find it never went through. The staff person was slow to find a resolution, and the customer left angry. Our order, which we placed in person, was also lost. They offered us a free dessert to compensate, and we accepted. After waiting a few more minutes, our order arrived, and I will say I think it was worth the (long) wait. A few other inconsistencies: I got one piece of cornbread and a couple pickle slices with mine; my companion got several pieces of bread and a lot of pickles. They didn't provide any BBQ sauce so we missed tasting theirs. Seems like they haven't fully got their act together--maybe they were understaffed or undertrained--but the place has delicious, fresh-cooked food and I will go back--and I hope I can give it a rave review next time. Despite the problems, an authentic, independent barbecue place here is North Scottsdale is definitely something worth supporting."}
{"text":"I am willing to proclaim after only one visit that this place has the best brisket in Arizona. Oh, and their other food is good too."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Tom's Thumb at a Yelp Elite Event awhile back.  Since then, I've been back twice, once for dinner and another time for breakfast.  I've gotta say, this place is legit.  I've enjoyed everything I've had and thoroughly appreciate the casual atmosphere.  The food is always prompt and the staff has been nothing but friendly and helpful.

For dinner I've had the brisket platter.  The brisket is smoked to perfection, tender, and very flavorful.  There is a plethora of sauces to choose from, but you really don't NEED any of them.  The meat alone is very good.  The toast and beans as well as the corn it came with were all good.  My only criticism would be the corn was a bit hard... it could have been cooked a little longer.  Otherwise it was all great.  For breakfast I had the commuter special... basically an egg mcmuffin.  It was cooked to order, warm, and just what I wanted.  The other people in my party also enjoyed their food, and raved so much I know we will be back.

Oh, we also got a car wash while we were at Tom's Thumb recently.  It came out great, especially the inside.  This local, unique spot is worth a visit.  There were plenty of people there when we came, which was good to see.  I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The BBQ brisket stack was stick to your ribs good. The half order consists of 3-4 slices of fall apart brisket and one egg stacked over crispy golden cheese hash brown. A spicy aioli accompanies the dish and adds just the right amount of heat. I don't have the appetite I once did and thought the half portion wasn't enough, nope I was wrong.  If you're not into the hash brown you still owe it to yourself to eat the brisket. 

Don't stray from the BBQ, the cinnamon roll looked good but was cold, crusty and dry.  I should have gone with a cookie instead."}
{"text":"The BBQ here is so good! I was in town for a business trip & my coworker recommended The Thumb. I am very happy we went to The Thumb & tried their BBQ. The store is also really cool. You can get gas, your car detailed & shop for goodies in the gift shop. Its a real one stop shop!"}
{"text":"Hip Hip Hooray for the Tom's Thumb Car Wash and dining experience.  Yes 5 big ones for a company with a lame name and less than favorable location.  We've lived in the area for years and unfortunately never ventured into this wonderful little bistro.  Food is simply outstanding hands down some of the best BBQ in this town.  Excellent Fresh Pulled Pork and brisket.  Ive been here 10 times since we found out about them a month ago.  Great Service and staff very nice market with some of the finer selections you might only find at AJ's.  My wife and I have had our cars through the wash every week and each time its a job well done.  Great excuse for me to sit and eat.  Oh did I mention they also have a coffee bar with amazing cupcakes.  Breakfast Lunch or Dinner make time for this place you will be glad you did.  Special thanks to the owner for putting together such a nice establishment.  Additional thanks to the chef for her outstanding approach to a variety of dishes recently voted one of the top 25 new restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"BBQ and Car Wash??  Don't let that deter you!!! It was a hard sell to my fellow travelers, but they certainly changed their mind when we got there.  Wife and I split the Chicken Chopped Salad, and the Pork/Brisket plate.  The meat was really good, rubbed and smoked well.  The sauce bar was fun, too.  I preferred the Hickory and the Old timer, or down home or something like that.  I cannot remember the name, but it was good.  The hot ones...they're hot, I do 3-4 star Chinese food and these were not quite there, but still had some kick.  If I go back, I might go with a sandwich or revisit the chicken chopped salad.  The chicken was really well cooked, the dressing was delicious, and while I thought they skimped on the chicken, at first, I realized later that they actually just had it really well integrated into the salad, and the chunks were not shredded or dry, it was really great, large, smoked chicken pieces.  Loved it... and I am typically a rack of ribs kind of guy."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here. Ordered the chopped salad and substituted pulled pork for smoked chicken. Excellent food! Service a little slow likely cuz we had a big group of 14. Recommend smaller group. Everyone was happy with their meal. Great little grocery and nice wine selection, too."}
{"text":"I've purposely waited on providing a review for Tom's Thumb Fresh Market. I'm glad I have, too, because there's just too much going on here to take in on a single visit. Tom's Thumb is a gas station meets car wash meets BBQ restaurant meets bakery meets market. The styling is unique and clean and engaging.

CAR WASH

Tom's Thumb offers, in my personal opinion, the best car wash in the area. Not only does the team do a consistently wonderful job, it's also a really great value. Order \"The Thumb\" for an all-around cleaning including a basic interior detail and you even get a 7-Day Guarantee, meaning you can come back for a Full Service Wash within 7 days if the car gets dirty or it rains, etc.!

The crew is quick and professional, resulting in a car wash that really is a head above the rest. Hard workers and attentive management make for a highly effective team.

BBQ RESTAURANT

The food here is really delicious. I can't speak highly enough about the menu. Most items are priced around the $10-15 mark, which may be a bit high, but well worth it considering flavor and serving size.

The service is also truly outstanding. Servers here treat guests with an old-school level of politeness and respect. It really feels like stepping back into another time altogether. I've always been very impressed with the service here.

Also can't help but LOVE all the different kinds of BBQ sauce! Oh man! So much fun. I always bring a bunch of little tasters back to the table with me so I can experience several flavors in a single sitting. Very unique and very YUMMM!

***As a result of Tom's Thumb's popularity, you may want to expect a pretty long wait in line when it comes to ordering your food. It seems like there's only ever one register open for a long line of guests waiting, which means that it may not be the best choice for a \"quick lunch stop\".

BAKERY

I have yet to order anything from the bakery, but everything I've ever seen here looks utterly delicious and my coworkers speak very highly of it as well. I'll be sure to make a point of ordering some tasty pastries here soon!

MARKET

Littered with all sorts of cutesy gift items as well as basic foodstuffs and even a pretty solid beer/wine section, the market at Tom's Thumb is nothing to be overlooked. Since it's right down the street from where I work, I could definitely see myself swinging by for a quick six-pack on my way home from work some time. Convenient, clean, and well-stocked. Can't go wrong!

CONCLUSION

If you've never been to Tom's Thumb Fresh Market, you're missing out. Plan to make a thing of it: drop your car off for a wash while you step inside to order delicious food and shop the market. Your car will be shiny clean and waiting for you by the time you're ready to leave. **Bring some cash because those car wash guys deserve a good tip, too!

Thanks, Tom's Thumb, for being awesome! I'm really impressed with your entire setup and will be sure to recommend you every chance I get!  :)"}
{"text":"My 9 year old is a fan of Diners Drive-ins and Dives, and requested we try this place because \"OMG Mom, it looks so cool!\" We have to give in to him occasionally as he sits through all of our \"great finds\". 

We talked my mother in law into going here, which was not an easy sell..\"A gas station!?\" We had to explain that it was much much more. So after some pep talks we finally had her interested.

We arrived a little late, 8ish? And the place was pretty busy, it is so beautiful...how often do you hear a gas station described that way? I loved that they had indoor and outdoor seating. My mother in law loved the patio and the fact that they have people who pump your gas for you...she commented on that several times.

So on to the food! I ordered the grits with pulled pork and they were fantastic, super creamy and exactly what I was looking for. The pork was a little dried out, but we were here pretty late in the day so I give them a pass on that. 

Mother in law and son had ribs, both really liked them. Husband had a pulled pork sandwich which he really enjoyed as well. My mother in law has reminded me several times since we have been there, that they have gas attendants! This place really blows her mind lol."}
{"text":"I have noticed a steady decline in the quality of both the food and the service. Still OK but certainly not the Tom's of yesterday"}
{"text":"I placed a catering order with less than an hour to pickup. I show up to Tom's Thumb and thought \"oh crap, no way I will get my food in 10 minutes\" -- The line was starting to be long!

Guess what? Literally as I walk up to the counter (5 minutes till pickup) they are finishing my order. Now that's impressive.

For myself personally, I love the taco trio (try all three and fall in love with the one you like the most)"}
{"text":"Do you like Taste? Do you like BBQ? Do you ever find yourself licking your fingertips while eating your food!? Well Tom's Thumb has tasty BBQ! I love the pulled pork or smoked chicken sandwich while getting gas and or a car wash!"}
{"text":"We choose this place because of Yelp's ratings. Very tasty food at a reasonable price. The smoked meats were delicious! The fire roasted corn appetizer, yummy! Only minor issue was our server who apparently had a rough night before was forgetful, charged wrong but apologetic.  Otherwise worth the trip!!!"}
{"text":"OMG...We decided to take a walk on the wild side...a barbecue joint at a carwash? It was FANTASTIC! Everything we had was amazing! The ribs were succulent,  the coleslaw was dressed perfectly and the shredded pork tacos were spot on. My favorite taste of the afternoon was definitely the Mexicorn...wow! Any time we are in the North Scottsdale area, you can be sure that we we be there!"}
{"text":"The Thumb was recommended by a local for breakfast or lunch and we were really happy we stopped in.  My daughter had the pulled pork sandwich with vinegar slaw and baked Mac. The pork was tender, juicy and great smoke flavor. Mac was delicious and the slaw was perfect for the sandwich side. My wife had the smoked chicken and it was amazing. Juicy, fall apart perfection with enough smoke flavor to compliment, not overpower the chicken flavor. Her cornbread was homemade and the baked beans were sweet and rich. 

The star of the show was the Brisket Stack. Tender, juicy lean brisket with a gorgeous smoke ring, over homemade hash browns topped with 2 fried eggs and a chili aolli. Bring your appetite because this thing is one of the best bbq combos I have ever had. The multiple dining areas are very nice and clean and the folks here are very friendly. 

On top of all that, you can fill up your car, get it washed and detailed, get baked goods, beer, wine and chatchkies out the wazoo.  

The Thumb is absolutely one of kind and worth the trip. If we come back to Scottsdale, it will be on our places to visit again."}
{"text":"I would give the bakery separately 5 stars if I could. We are die hard sweet fanatics so we did try the pastries before leaving. The girl behind that counter was very sweet and seemed to care. The snickerdoodles and peanut butter chocolate cake were to die for. 

We  had high hopes for this place after seeing it on Check Please Arizona. We made the 30 minute drive to scottsdale at 4:45 in the afternoon. They were already out of brisket, ribs and sausage. We had already made the drive out there so decided to try pulled pork which wouldn't be in our top 3 choices. I can see running out of items an hour or two before closing but before a Saturday evening rush, I don't think that's acceptable. The people behind us walked out after seeing the sign as did at least 10 customers. 

We were the first in line when we arrived so our order was taken right away. However the person behind counter seemed to be doing us a favor by taking it. As we were in the restaurant the line grew long and only one person was taking orders. We saw multiple people working but kind of in slow motion again as if they were doing a favor for the customers. 

The sauces were almost empty, one tea was empty, there were no more knives left and one coke machine was out of coke. 

As for the food the pulled pork was good, the Mac and cheese was good and the beans were good."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday, and, the food, once again was great! I had a couple of if-ey experiences before, but, they are back. When I wrote about them, the manager (Michael) asked me to give them another try. So, I did. I did not let him know I was the one who expressed disappointment in recent visits. I was pleasantly surprised how good everything was. The are back to their old self, which is Great. Any restaurant can have an off day, but, it is how they handle criticism that is important in getting back to their old self. Would definitely recommend this great BBQ again."}
{"text":"We office in their neighborhood and honestly, I can not say enough about how awesome the team here is!! We had a last minute company gathering during Barrett Jackson (one of their busiest weeks of the year) and asked them to accommodate 30 people for lunch. Not only did they do it on very short notice, their team made us (and our kids) feel welcome and every one of our employees had rave reviews of the service. We had a mix of the brown bag lunch specials, and racks of ribs. They took our call ahead order, and everything was ready when we arrived. Bill, Brenda, and their staff were wonderfully helpful. We will give all our catering business to them from now forward! Two weeks later and our employees still can't stop talking about the ribs!!! A HUGE \"THANK YOU\" from Mustang Steel Erectors!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. The staff really friendly along with the manager Mike. Love this place!  I highly recommend this place. Also the best car wash."}
{"text":"Amazing concept. Works for dads, moms and kids. Food is tasty and affordable. I loved the no sco burrito and husband has the 2 eggs breakfast. Both delicious and best coffee we've had in Arizona so far. We'll be back next time we visit!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It sure is different. The food is excellent. The whole counter experience sucks and it's why I'm giving it 3 stars. First of all, the cashiers seem to go MIA and when they do appear, they seem confused about what's going on and why you'd be placing an order. It's completely off putting to stand in line 20 minutes to be told there is a 30 minute wait once you get to the counter. I get it, it's an artisan market. But it's also lunch time and you are a counter service establishment and most people are going out of their way to grab this sandwich or salad. 

:("}
{"text":"Tom's Thumb was an unexpected delight! I'm upset with myself for waiting so long to try it. 

I work just a couple of miles away and took a quick jaunt over on my lunch break earlier this week. It is not one of those places that you would just stumble upon as you're driving past - it is situated within a large gas station and car wash, so you either need to be looking for it or have a serendipitous discovery while waiting for your car's besparkling to conclude. 

That said, it is really surprising little treat. There seem to be a few ways into the building - I happened to park near a doorway by the outdoor restaurant seating and ducked in through there. I ended up in the midst of their little \"dining room\" and found my way to the counter on the right to order lunch (there is another counter on the opposite side which is where you can order desserts or coffee) 

I was greeted by a friendly employee as I entered and the employee I ordered from was proactive and helpful as well! I got their Tom's Choice Brown Bag special - $10 includes a pulled pork sandwich, a bag of chips, and a fountain drink. While I feel that overall their pricing is a little bit steep for what it is, I think that this is a very good value. The sandwich is generously sized on a delicious, soft bun and comes with a small cup of fresh slaw (dressed in vinegar, not mayo) along with some garnish (pickles and onions, I think) The slaw was delicious!! 

The Pulled Pork was awesome - nice smoked flavor, moist without being soggy and not too dry/hard. The portion was huge - I ate the sandwich and still had pork left over to enjoy with a fork and knife.

They have a wide selection of barbecue sauces - I tried 4 on my visit: The Hickory, which is a pretty straightforward sweet/smoky barbecue sauce that was quite yummy, the Low Country, which has bacon in it and was very flavorful and savory, the Habanero, which they describe as \"3 Alarm\" - it was the perfect level of spiciness, with a kick but not enough to burn your mouth off, and my favorite, the Carolina, which is an almost-clear brown liquid that is really delicious and makes the already amazing pulled pork all the more flavorful and moist - it is amazing!

The chips and soda are your standard gas station/sandwich place fare - the soda is from one of the large fountains where you can select your type of soda and then add all sorts of flavorings to it. The one on the left was a little annoying as the touch screen didn't work super well. The chips were of the bagged variety - I think they were Ms. Vickers or similar. I did enjoy using the chips to dip into the remaining barbecue sauce - very yummy!

I also stopped over and got a chocolate-chip toffee cookie to go - it was great! A bit crispy, which I like, and chock full of toffee/chocolate pieces. They had a variety of other desserts that did tempt me - a bourbon pecan tart, a s'mores bar, along with various macaroons and additional cookies (some of which looked to be gluten free!) 

The \"restaurant\" counter and dining room are so cutely decorated! It is a bit surreal to have lunch while sitting amidst a gas station, but they do a nice job of visually separating the space without actually partitioning between the areas. The décor is rustic/southwestern with a kick - I love the huge crystal chandelier, the chalkboard signs, and pallet-wood benches for the banquette-style tables. I would normally worry that a restaurant set within a busy gas station/car wash/market would feel a bit overwhelming and chaotic, but my dining experience was serene and quiet, with no real disruptions. Additionally, it was very clean. There were employees circulating continuously to clear the tables and check to see if guests needed anything. 

If you find yourself in North Scottsdale or are in search of delicious BBQ here in the valley, I would highly encourage you to check out Tom's Thumb for a wonderful meal! Go in with your expectations in the right place (This is not a fine dining restaurant but it is also unlike any other place I've been) and you will likely be blown away!"}
{"text":"Ive been here twice now, once for breakfast and once for dinner.  Everything has been completely amazing.  Don't let the \"it looks like a gas station\" fool you.  The food served here is incredible.  Ive had the pulled pork sandwich, the breakfast tacos (1 chicken 1 brisket) and the country benedict.  I would highly recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"This is in a gas station. And it's the coolest damn gas station you'll ever go to! You walk in and are hit with a wall of the best smelling BBQ. 

Whoever was in charge of the decor deserves a medal. Fish tank? Yep. Neon lights? Sure thing. Chandelier? Got that too. Maintaining a southwest, down home BBQ feel? Check that box too. I have no idea how they managed to blend modern with cowboy, but they figured it out. 

And I haven't even gotten to the food yet....

Oh. My. Stars. First of all they have breakfast all day, second their BBQ is heavenly (with a million different sauces to choose from), but if BBQ isn't your thing they have salads, sandwiches, Mexicorn, and pretty much anything else that will make you slobber all over the table. 

This is a hidden gem that you need to go to. I've taken many clients to lunches here and it's perfect, but also perfect for the family. 

Word to the wise, avoid visiting at 1230 because there will be no parking and the line will be out the door.

Finally, check out the drink selection and little shopping area in the back, but be careful because you'll want to by everything in sight."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a pleasant surprise!

As a KCBS certified BBQ judge, I am very picky about my BBQ.  Campfire Bistro has it figured out.  This place is a must.  Just opened @ Tom Thumb's gas station @ 9393 E. Bell Road in Scottsdale.  Haven't even had their grand opening yet (weekend of 4/28-4/29).  Got the 2 meat platter of with pork and brisket.  Both were perfectly tender and a nice punch of smoke flavor.  For the side I had the shoestring fries.  Warning: They are highly addictive.  They have a counter with a wide variety of sauces.  I didn't put any on the meat because when the meat is that good, sauce can only ruin it in my mind.  However, I did use them to dip the fries in and they really had some interesting unique flavors.  Try the Low Country, the Texas, and regular sauces.

TWO HUGE THUMBS UP HERE!"}
{"text":"Our family of four came for lunch and each had something different and all were wonderful. So good, my husband and I decided to come back again for our breakfast - again, amazing! Food was amazing. Staff were amazing. We got our SUV detailed while we ate, amazing as well. Great shopping too. Love this place will be back again and again! 

Don't miss the bakery, dessert is to die for!"}
{"text":"The barbecue is yummy and there are several barbecue sauce options. They've got a cute little store with little trinkets, goodies, and home decor items. Overpriced, but still cute. The carwash and cleaning is the best around and they always do a great job. I definitely recommend coming to Toms Thumb!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to this place. Used to love it. Meat was moist and perfectly cooked and the sides like the beans were fresh and full of flavor. Recently came in and got a three meat platter. The meat was terrible and obviously reheated, not freshly carved or pulled. The turkey was dry as a board. The brisket was Fatty, which is good, but the far was hard and rubbery not melted. The pork lacked smiley flavor and was under seasoned. The sides were terrible and flavorless. 

Bring back the old ownership or chef or ingredients or whatever about this place used to make it awesome. Will not return until you do!!"}
{"text":"My friend told me about this place this past weekend. We went Sunday morning and was pleasantly surprised!!

If you drive up and think that this is just a gas station and drive on, you are missing out!  Yes its a Gas Station/Car Wash (They do an Awesome job according to my friend!)/Convenience store/Gift Shop/Coffee Shop and a Restaurant!! Oh, they have Wine there too!

The only reason I did not give that fifth star was for the customer service. We walked in the front and passed 3 employees, not one said anything to us. We got by a total of 5 employees and not a peep out of them. No welcome, nothing. 

I had the No'Sco' Breakfast Burrito - $8.00
Scrambled eggs, grilled peppers & onions, jalapeño bacon & local cheddar stuffed in a whole grain tortilla & served with chipotle salsa and sour cream.

Loved it but you will probably want to order a side or two. For me this was not enough, but remember I'm a big eater.

Next visit I will be ordering the Pig's and Grits along with Biscuits and Gravy.

You can not go wrong here. Check out this place!!"}
{"text":"First time today. Car wash and lunch. Pretty busy but customer service was great. Need to explore the menu a bit more. Shared the 3 meat and 2 sides with my husband.  Brisket was good as was the pulled pork. Surprisingly I preferred the chicken! Coleslaw was the mayo based but was watery and not creamy. Potato salad was better. Only tried 3 of the sauces. Not a favorite yet. Need to try the other 6 next time."}
{"text":"I love this place! I stop here after my rides with friends for breakfast (breakfast tacos are delicious). I love to meet people here for meetings over coffee because it's not Starbucks... Have had many items from the menu and can't say I've had anything bad. The Mac & Cheese was especially good! The staff is friendly and the manager is great! Try this place, if you haven't already."}
{"text":"This review was based more on the service then the food. If the service was up to par and I didn't dell like we were not wanted there it would probabaly be a 4. Food was great! But the service. First when we got there the \"greeter\" did not seemed to be thrilled we were there when seating us but she was great compared to our waitress. She took forever to come and take oure order and when she did she has a smile on her face but seemed disapointed when she had to serve us. When we got our food and asked for BBQ sauce she looked at us like we were idiots and pointed to the bottles. Once we were done eating again ti took a good 10-15 minutes for her to get us our check, had to ask the bus boy to get her for us. I thought I may have been sensitive but both of my sons's that were with me commented on how rude she was. Oh well one place I won't be back to."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick breakfast today. Upon walking in, you can't help but notice that the place had been soiled by the presence of Guy Fieri. Any time I notice that ass clown has been someplace I'm at, I am immediately skeptical since the places that dumbass goes to have to pay Food Network for the appearance. 
Anyways, I ordered the Breakfast Tacos with Brisket. I mean really, you can't go wrong with steak and eggs, right? Upon receiving my tacos, I was pleasantly surprised. The plate looked great. After that, it was mediocre at best. It was just....'meh'. Since it was over priced for what is essentially breakfast comfort food ($6.50 plus a $2 charge for the Brisket) and they managed to make what should have been fantastic into a disappointment, I can't see why I would go back.
Seriously, what is up with you lemmings that think that this place is great. All you are paying for is a dressed up gas station that serves very average food. Way to promote another loser, N. Snobbsdale."}
{"text":"To start, we saw this place in Diners, Drive-in's and Dives. That being said, it was an over-all great experience. Really the only reason for a 4 vs 5 star review is the number of times I heard 'we're out' while visiting. How can a BBQ joint run out of its own sauce?! 

The food is great. No dry meats here. And the sauces I did have were classic flavors. Their XXX isn't too hit but does have a sneaky kick over time. The Memphis Mop was tasty as well, and the Sweet Baby James (formerly Carolina) is very nice with a solid vinegar tang. All in all, a great food experience. I had the tacos, my wife had the meat platter. Smiles all around. 

Long story short, go check out the tasty grub at this unexpected gas station eatery."}
{"text":"Sooo good! Our go to BBQ place! Never had a bad experience and everything I have tried is amazing!  Save room for the baked goods too!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept and tasty food! Large menu offering breakfast lunch and dinner options! Clean inside and they even have a bakery/ coffee bar! While you wait check out all the cute Knick knacks they have! 

I ordered the pulled chicken tacos with a side of the Mac and cheese! Pulled tacos were flavorful and juicy! I didn't really care for the salsa they give on the side since the chicken is already season well! 

Mac and cheese was prob THE CHEESIEST I've ever had!Didn't disappoint 

BF got the pulled pork Sammie and it was tasty!

We both got two beers on tap, the dragoon IPA and the orang blossom.  We sat outside and enjoyed the patio space with the sun shining on us!

Don't overlook this spot, the gas station idea can be a little odd but once you step inside you'll forget where you are :)"}
{"text":"OMG... can you say fantastic?  We were so blown away by all the things we ordered... I'm at a loss of words and where to begin... let's start with what we ordered:

So, they were out of brisket by the time we got there but no biggie we had plenty of other options to try.

Tacos - 2 Pulled Chicken + 1 Pulled Pork - 5/5
Cuban Sandwich - 5/5
Sliders (combo-fied) - 5/5
1/2 LB Smoked Sausage Links - 4.5/5
Chili Bowl - 4/5
Mexicorn - 3/5
Potato Salad - 5/5

So tacos... amazing mouthgasm.  Get it.  It had such depth of flavor and the portions were huge.  Meat to tortilla ratio was very worth.  I had originally cringed at the 10 buck price tag (that's the Asian in me), but I would pay more for these babies after eating them.  Comes with Pico, a Roja sauce, and some lettuce.  Bomb diggity.

Next is the cubano... it had their smoked pulled pork and I must say it was delicious.  The price to portion ratio was a little bit not as worth but flavor wise it was on point.

Sliders were amazing with the nice thick, can I even call it mini patties.  Add on the in house pickles were so tasty and I'm not even a pickle fan.  This was extremely worth and the shoestring fries were so tasty it was awesome.

Now the smoked sausage links were really yummy and for 1/2 a pound it seemed like we got more than we were expecting.  I would suggest to get 1/2 lb for a family of 3-4.  The price per pound was on the pricier side and really I felt like this was a nice side to all the other things we ordered, thus the rating.  It was a nice sidekick, not really the star of this review (see tacos).

Chili Bowl was good and hearty but maybe it was because I just made some bomb Texas chili the other day, but I felt like I did a better job or maybe I was chilied out but yes, solid chili... not amazing I gotta get this again chili.

Now yelpers I really have to call you guys out on the Mexicorn.  It looked like the pictures, but tasted just okay to me.  It needed more sauce/creamy/cheesiness, but just more.  I was disappointed by this side more so because I was so hyped up on it by y'all.

My babe is really into potato salad so we got some.  It was good, and I personally would not have gotten it if he wasn't there with me.  But yea it was yummy and the baby liked it too.

I gotta put in a word about the different BBQ sauces.  I must say every one of them was solid A++ especially Toto's and the Memphis one (I can't recall the exact name) I would buy the sauce by itself if they sold it.

Next time we will have to try the brisket stack and come back soon.  I'm craving it just writing this review haha.  Tom's thumb is doing something right folks... it's definitely worth the drive for."}
{"text":"A little weird to dine at a gas station but it's really good! The french fries are addictive."}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM!  Very good BBQ, sides and sauces.  Almost everything there is homemade down to the salad dressings :)  Haven't tried their breakfast menu yet, but I can't wait to!  Sounds just as delish!  If you're looking for some tasty BBQ, do yourself a favor and head over there."}
{"text":"when i first went to this car wash i thought it was outstanding. i told neighbors that it was worth the cost. since then they car wash has broke the windshield wiper (on back window) they didnt even tell me. just put the wiper on the seat. next time they broke the lever on the car seat. the manager looked at me like i was making things up. the last 4 times i have taken my car into the place they have done a terrible job on the cleaning of the car-especially the windows. i will never go back to this place. 
very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Everyone in this place is friendly, and it's very clean.   Having lived in the South you never know what you're going to get from a restaurant in a gas station.   This place is nice.   

The Kids had sliders and chicken skewers and they loved them.  They can't wait to go back.  I had the 2 meat platter with brisket and pulled pork.  The meat was smokey and tender, but dry.  We did stop in towards closing so I probably got the scraps from the day.  Their homemade sauces were good and they have plenty to suit varied palates.  

We ordered 2 kids meals, 2 adult meals, shoestring fries and waters and spent over 50 bucks, so it ain't cheap.  I smoke pork and beef in my green egg at home so I'm a bit picky when it comes to BBQ, and while this place has potential I'm not sure its worth $50 for 4.  But if you're not a BBQ connoisseur but enjoy BBQ, I'd recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Excellent bbq! The brisket was very flavorful and the macaroni and cheese was very cheesy. The atmosphere was pretty sweet as well. The large fish tank and chandeliers were very nice. There is also a very nice gift store with wine and other gifts to look around after having some bbq. Highly recommend for a quick delicious dinner."}
{"text":"Great meats.  Fries are a must.  The building has lots of places to buy specialty food and beer items. Plus you can get gas and a car wash. But the main reason to make this your destination is the barbecue. The ribs are crazy good"}
{"text":"Place is a darn Freak Show! Car wash, gas station, gourmet BBQ restaurant, and high end gift shop. Sounds crazy, doesn't it? Yet it seems to work on some level. 

But, this place just isn't for me. They have a killer soda fountain, one of those with 15,000 different flavors. Other than that, the food prices are really expensive, for a gas station, anyways. And the boutique-se gift shop has some neat stuff, but again, mega overpriced for my tastes.

I guess it's unique enough to visit once, but after that, I can get anything they have there a helluva' lot cheaper at nearby stores, and gas stations."}
{"text":"We're new to town and looking for a place to eat with my 14-month old son and my in-laws. We needed fast, close to home, afforable, and good food that's not too fancy for my in-laws who like to keep things pretty basic. I chose Tom's Thumb Fresh Market after reading the rave reviews on Yelp and they delivered on all fronts.  When I told my husband we were going to eat at a BBQ restaurant in a car wash he thought I was nuts. Now he can't wait to go back. 

You'd never expect that kind of quality to come from a car wash restaurant, but the ambiance was casually nice, the service was great, and the food was excellent! I loved my pulled pork sandwich and the rest of the fam thoroughly enjoyed their dinner as well. We also shared the creme brule cheesecake and peach cobbler for dessert and loved it!

 Since it's so close to home, I can definitely see this place becoming a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"First off, thanks to GM Michael for taking the time to read my review (and others) and act on the complaints/suggestions. Many owners/managers have written me, but few have gone to this extent to make sure I was satisfied (including texting me). Not going to recap my old review, but the side dishes were much improved and the brisket sandwich was stacked with that same excellent brisket from my previous visit. I would even suggest to get the sandwich over the platter due to more meat. They even added a new cole slaw which is mayo based and that was my favorite. The vinegar slaw was much improved with celery salt and the mac and cheese has returned to the original recipe and now includes Ritz cracker crumbs instead of panko. The staff is very friendly and for me - finding Mello Yellow Zero in the freestyle machine was a plus. Once again, thanks for bringing me back from the dark side."}
{"text":"Great food, fun store and a gas station all in one and right off the 101 Freeway. Walking distance for us yessss :)"}
{"text":"Love that I can get my car washed and have lunch with the kids while we wait. Car wash service is great. The service inside is a little slow, but the people are not unpleasant. They are never too friendly, but kind nonetheless."}
{"text":"This unexpected gem (located inside a gas station!) serves the best brisket Ever.... Can't wait to go back!  :-D"}
{"text":"Husband saw The Thumb on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives on Sat and Sunday we went, Wow we loved the Thumb , Super cool and food was very tasty and great. I got the smoked chicken salad Super Fresh , Husband got Blackend Catfish sandwich he loved it so much we returned 2 days later and brought our friends . Fantastic food and great friendly staff . Special shot out to Miguel   who was awesome  friendly and curtious  Miguel even gave us the run down about the fish tank from tanked.  We had a great time and will be back over and over again.

{"text":"Freaking amazing pulled pork sandwich!!! Can't wait to try more of their other stuff on their menu. Definitely bringing the family to check this place out. Recommend them highly!"}
{"text":"I took my Jeep Rubicon in for a detail service prior to Christmas.  It was super busy and they only had 3 detailers working, and  I suspect they were overwhelmed.  I went to Tom Thumbs Fresh market (which has wireless freely available) to wait it out.  It took about  5 hours, and they were unable to finish the job in time for a party I had to attend.

Get this - they allowed me to come back the next day and they finished the job and spectacularly!  A lot of places I've been to do a poor job of detailing.  However, They spent 10 hours on a $150 detail, and my jeep was cleaner then when I bought it (I don't even know how that is possible but its true).

I'll be taking my Panamera there next for their $300 detail (it needs it:).

As an aside, the food is fantastic - BLTs are the best I've had - even better then when I make them at home.  They tend to cook bacon on the undercooked side, so recommend asking for well done if you like your bacon well done.

Grats peeps, you earned my business forever."}
{"text":"@quinterogolf
We are so happy to have Tom's Thumb in the neighborhood of our corporate office.  It is the best place for BBQ.  The wonderful part is your car is cleaned while you eat!"}
{"text":"So, we had a not so great experience here earlier this year, and when I posted my not so good review, I received a message from Michael Lawson, the General Manager of The Thumb, asking me to please give him and the restaurant a chance for a do-over - which we were able to do last week during a pop-in lunch while visiting our childhood \"home\" - AZ.  

Words can't fully expresses how impressed I am by Michael's passion and respect for his staff and restaurant, and the value he places on satisfying his customers.  This level of excellence is far too rare in the service industry today, and I commend him for his outreach and professionalism.  

Our meal, the service, the genuine care shown to us (my wife, son, daughter-in-law, and grandkids) by the staff was, across the board, exceptional.  

We had a full rack of ribs, a pulled chicken sand, pork sliders, chile, BBQ tacos, soft drinks and beers, and several orders of fries.

Perfectly prepared, promptly served, and as we had children with us, very very kid \"smart.\"

We will be back and I highly recommend that if you love BBQ, love good food, that you and yours visit The Thumb at your earliest opportunity,

Puns be darned... The Thumb gets enthusiastic THUMBS UP!

Thank you Michael."}
{"text":"Oh yeah the BBQ goes hard!  This place has the best BBQ in area...really great market with lots of cheese and meats and really cool decor."}
{"text":"So I've been going to school in Arizona for the past couple weeks and some classmates recommended the thumb . Their ribs , mac & cheese and corn are so amazingly delicious ... i left nothing on the plate . The ribs were so soft and you could taste the smoke . So if you are ever in the Scottsdale are definitely pay Toms Thumb a visit . You won't regret it  ( they were also on Diners , drive ins & dives )"}
{"text":"Guy Fiere DDD is right on! This place is legit! I eat bbq at the most infamous joints in Central TX and this compares favorably. I will find excuses to drive 30 minutes to eat at The Thumb again. So little time, so many items to try! Great staff and service. Good tunes and AZ craft brews! What else do you need?"}
{"text":"My brother and I picked this place because it was on DDDs. At first you pull up and think it's kind of odd but in the end it was all worth the quarkyness of the stop. Great food, definitely recommend the Mac n cheese, and sit by the fish tank. I loved the huge sauce board and station. A lot of variety and stuff for the whole family to enjoy."}
{"text":"Heard about it on Check Please and went there.  We thoroughly like BBQ but didn't think this was nearly as good as other places.  Actually, the ribs were a 4 but  the sides were quite weak. The mac and cheese was the worst, and the sweet potato fries were ok, but cole slaw was not very tasty. Room for improvement"}
{"text":"Cute place. Loved the beef brisket sandwich and the beans. Would like to see the barbecue sauces on the table."}
{"text":"Just relocated and our cars were in dire need of a bath. A realtor suggested this place to us. I was really confused at first. A car wash and good BBQ? I wasn't sure what to expect, so we went. And it was great! 

Our cars were thoroughly washed and my husband's was hand waxed. Both came out looking fantastic! While we waited, we had some BBQ for lunch. Having lived in the South, was this the best BBQ ever? No. But my plate was clean and I was pretty surprised at how good it was! 

Inside you will also find a bakery, great wine selection, beer, and an extensive gift shop ranging from kitchen decor to kids books. There was literally a little bit of everything!

I might not always go for lunch, but this is our new car wash spot. For anyone from the Midwest or Denver, think Waterway on steroids."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come to for BBQ and odds and ends. This place has a great family yet stylish feel. The staff is extremely kind and helpful. Specifically, I would like to thank Mike and Steven for their help!  I would definitely recommend this place for a great environment and fabulous food !!"}
{"text":"I was distracted when i made my order, so I wound up getting an andouille sausage sandwich: it was smoked nicely, but I will admit I could have ordered better. When I actually had a chance to read the menu in full I could have identified 20 meals I'd rather have had, all of which looked quite good. So my main advice is: Check out the menu online before you arrive and know what you want. It's a popular place and the menu is long and detailed!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Everyone was very nice and the food was great...they have everything in this place! We had bbq pork sliders..They have so many different flavors of bbq sauce..It was so delicious. Thank you for a great meal. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"We watched toms thumb on triple D. Tried it,and I have to say best BBQ in town. In a month we have been back 5 times. brisket sandwich, ribs, mac and cheese, collard greens are all Five star. The potato salad is the only one we have tried and didn't love.  I was a huge Bobby Q's fan. And after Tom's thumb I don't care to return to Bobby Q's again."}
{"text":"Holy BBQ this place is off the chain for BBQ and anything food its amazing. On top of that get a car wash or gas. And say what's up to the owner Mike and his family the are the nicest people very hospitable they will definitely take care of you."}
{"text":"Cool vibe, great food and friendly staff. They recently changed their BBQ sauce recipe which isn't as good as it used to be and the last 2 times my food was brought out cold, but overall their pulled pork and brisket is some of the best in the Valley."}
{"text":"I was there for lunch Sunday, no fish tank. Today, fish tank!  Try the Cuban Sandwich. It's  excellent...."}
{"text":"OK, to be fair, my fellow Yelpers must know that the Manager of Tom's Thumb has attempted to remedy my last review by asking me to come again.  I LOVE that gesture, and it was very much appreciated!  I am only sorry that it took me so long to 1) return, and 2) to update my review.

I returned in November to an updated menu and better service, which was a most pleasant surprise!  I would like to say my breakfast experience was different, and it was a bit better, but not markedly so.  Like I said earlier, please don't let me taint you, as I don't really think that breakfast is their specialty.  Go for lunch or dinner.

But please also remember that the Manager did try to do the right thing.  We're simply not getting it JUST right (Mama Bear).  :-)"}
{"text":"Great pulled pork sandwich and fries. Clean atmosphere. BBQ sauces are really good. Nice place to dine for lunch or dinner. Haven't tried breakfast yet, but hear good things."}
{"text":"The food was good but not for the price we paid. It's good for a gas station as well. The corn was under cooked for sure. I did like the BBQ beans a lot. I do feel for the amount you spend it should knock your socks off or taste like you cooked it at home. I do it a 3.5 but it wouldn't let me do that on the stars."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is Awesome... including the fact that its also a gas station
...lol. 
I had the brisket, pulled pork, Mac n cheese and bbq beans.  (Took me 2 days to eat it all  )
The Mac n. Cheese is so rich and creamy! The beans are unique and have a kick I like. They compliment the smoky brisket well. The cornbread was dry and not sweet like I'm used to but with everything else so good I wasn't that disappointed.  
I'm looking forward to going back and trying more before I leave AZ to head back home"}
{"text":"So good.  Everything smoked onsite.  Their mustard sauce is amazing.  Their chipotle even better."}
{"text":"BEST CAR WASH EVER! I can even eat a pulled pork sandwich while I wait to have my car cleaned to perfection. 

No wonder they won AZFOOTHILLS BEST OF OUR VALLEY contest! Check them out asap-"}
{"text":"Heard about this place a while ago and was looking forward to trying it.  I was pretty hungry after a long hike in the McDowells and wanted to go somewhere quick with good eats.  This was it.  Located at a gas station and car wash I had to double check the address to make sure I was at the correct place.   I had the pulled pork sandwich.  Amazing.  Tender and tasty.  So good, I can eat just the pork without any sauce.  If you do want sauce, they have a number to choose from.  Can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu.  Great service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Damn it! Those collards greens are so good... I know I'm going to be craving this place now all the time.  I had the brisket, mexicorn, and collard greens. The cornbread was great too. This place is a 5 star yumfest. I can't wait to come back and try something else!"}
{"text":"Best place to get a car wash, and buy wine, and a cool hostess gift, and sit down for some eclectic cuisine, or a delicious bakery goodie, or play a game of chess...only bad thing is my car wash winds up being $100 :)"}
{"text":"My friend was staying at a fancy schmancy hotel in North Scottsdale so it was the perfect opportunity to hit up this spot.  It was worth the drive! We had the 3 piglets and taco trio.  Meats were generous and full of flavor. Different BBQ sauces for you to mix-and-match. Prices are reasonable for the food and atmosphere. Not outrageously expensive. I will definitely be coming back here. Tom's Thumb will join Oklahoma Joe's on my list of awesome gas-station-bbq joints."}
{"text":"Good concept....poor performance. I love me some BBQ....especially while waiting for my car.  However theirs was dry.  I was excited to try the pulled pork omelet with mozzarella.   People must be deprived of good bbq in NorSco because this was weak.  Now I will try again because I have to have some brisket.  But never again with the pork or eggs.  BOO."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly the best damn BBQ joint in Arizona.  It is in the middle of a gas station and car wash.  It is very casual.  It is very comfortable.  The brisket is to die for.  I went there because I was told it was featured on Diners Drive ins and Dives.  I can't wait to go back and try some of the other items available."}
{"text":"Delicious!! these ribs melt off the bone. Quick, easy, friendly service. I live just up the road, this place is impressive. Was not expecting this quality. I Highly recommend Tombs Thumb BBQ."}
{"text":"Best barbecue this side of the Mississippi!!!! Come here your car washed and detailed pick up some Petroleum, and slap your lips around the best barbecue you've had in Arizona!!! Hot diggity !!!"}
{"text":"My husband works by Tom's Thumb and insisted that I try it. Has taken me to lunch a few times and we always get our little guy a cookie. I absolutely love it, it is the best establishment I have been to! It is cozy and the customer service is OUTSTANDING!!! I love the country feel it had and of course....allll the amazing items to buy.
Thanks"}
{"text":"Went on a friends recommendation, was not disappointed one bit.  So many choices and I couldn't decide.  Went with the Cubano sandwich & roasted Mexican corn.  The sandwich was so great, the only downside, it wasn't the traditional bread (more of a ciabatta roll), the fries were the shoestring potatoes, were very good, selection of BBQ sauces, were available. The roasted corn was good, was a little cold though.  Will definitely be back to try some BBQ (even though the drive is a little far from Central Phoenix)."}
{"text":"Great place to take out of town visitors.. They freak when you say your taking them to a gas station and then are pleasingly surprised, by the high quality food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in scottsdale and at a gas station!  Seriously brisket was amazing. And the mustard BBQ sauce - yum!  Can purchase sauce by the pint!  Fun place to shop while waiting for friends or food."}
{"text":"Great Food, Service and a car wash without pressure up sells!   Priceless... :) great place to hang out while waiting for your car."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place.  Great BBQ, breakfast, lunch and dinner!  My favorite is the pig and grits.... crispy pork, bacon, and cheesy grits with option of adding an egg.  Superb!  Everything on the menus is delicious!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Phoenix Metro.  Do not miss the brisket and mexicorn.  After eating check out the cool stuff all around the shop.  

The Thumb rocks!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, but seriously the best part about this place is the staff! Literally blown away by the attitude of these kids. Give these girls a raise!"}
{"text":"There have been a great deal of changes at this place recently...and unfortunately.  I don't understand why you would try to fix something that isn't broken.  Food is still decent but I can't say I am happy about the so called \"improvements.\""}
{"text":"DDD has definitely chosen some amazing spots! We're vacationing in Scottsdale and had to check out The Thumb! We ordered the brisket sandwich and the three little pigs with pulled pork & brisket. Absolutely the best BBQ I've ever had. They have many different kinds of BBQ sauces choose from and the flavor and seasoning of the meat was unreal! Sooo good!! The wait was not long & food was fabulous. I never would have stopped at a gas station/car wash for BBQ but I'm so glad we watch DDD and got a chance to experience this hot spot!!! You definitely must eat here if you're in Scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"Their Cubano is excellent!  Looks like a gas station on the outside, but go inside and get lunch at the grill.  You'll be amazed at how good their Cubano (or the pulled pork, ribs) sandwich is."}
{"text":"I'm all about convenience and Tom's Thumb is the epitome of that. As I pulled into work today my gas light came on, and after all this rain we had my car was in desperate need of a wash. I prefer not to do these things after work to avoid the rush. Also, a lot of the car washes I've gone to lately haven't been cutting it. Tom's Thumb gave me the convenience of being able to fill up my tank, get my car washed and grab some delicious lunch in under an hour. 

Not only is this place time-saving, the things that they do, they do very well. My car was sparkling clean when I went to pick it up. They did a better job than I've seen in a very long time. So well, that I'm pretty sure I will only exclusively get it washed here. Off I went in my freshly cleaned car with my to-go sandwich and salad in hand. I ordered the half sandwich-half salad combo with smoked chicken salad. The chicken was delicious, flavorful and not disguised by a massive amount of mayo. The cranberry bread added some sweet to the savory chicken. My salad had fresh tomatoes, cojita cheese and a delicious balsamic vinaigrette. I really love this concept and it's great when they get everything right! After my great experience today, I'll be adding this into my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Not really sure it is a \"hidden gem\" anymore and surprised not more people now about this place. Had the taco's trios with all three of the meats: smoked chicken, pulled pork, and brisket. All three were very good but my favorite was the brisket. Great smoke flavor and super tender. For someone eating their for the first time, this is a great way to sample the different meats that are offered. 

If you find yourself there for lunch (weekdays only) the brown bag special is a great deal as it includes a large pulled pork sandwich, chips, and drink for like $8. The pulled pork is some of the better pulled pork in town and the pickled veggies that come on the side are a nice addition. Another good sandwich is their  version of the Cuban which they used their pulled pork in place of ham.

If you drink yourself up in the area, definitely check out \"the thumb\"."}
{"text":"This is a hard review to write.  If you are asking me about the restaurant and store, I would give them five stars.  If you are asking about the car wash, I would give them one star.  Hence, my rating.  We go to the BBQ as often as possible as it is just down the street and oh so good! The store is fun and has just about anything you need in a pinch...and then some! We often take guests to our favorite gas station for lunch...and they always love it.

As to the car wash, save your money.  I have given them multiple chances.  The $26 Thumb wash isn't worth $2. You can get a better wash at Costco at about a third of the price.  While fancy, the last several times I have been, they are in such a hurry that they do a lousy job.  The interior windows weren't even done, there were water spots all over the car and they forget to put in air freshener. It used to be much better but it is no longer worth the premium.  Save your money and go to Costco or one of the other sub-$10 places and vacuum the car yourself."}
{"text":"Well, well, well!  Well done!  This hidden gem is now my favorite bbq joint in the US (I've never been outside the north American continent)!  Best brisket I've ever had!  So, I was traveling from Indiana out to Scottsdale to visit my daughter and I didn't go once, I had to go back for seconds!  And, because of the 1st time, in which they were out of their baked mac and cheese ( which simply melts in your mouth), manager Mike came to our table and made us feel like we were special, not just another customer.  From the brisket, to the pulled pork, to their awesome mexicorn, this place does not disappoint!   Very evident also when you hear the other patrons oohing and ahhing over their meal.  DON'T LET THE GAS STATION/DETAIL SHOP FACADE FOOL YOU!  The reviews are real!  A must try for the bbq enthusiast.  Oh, and the baked beans are AUHMAZING too!"}
{"text":"Like most everyone else, we saw this on the food network and had to finally check it out.  Wow!  What a great place.   The kitschy side of the store/gas station aside, the BBQ is outstanding.  The brisket was tender and tasty and the pulled pork is among the best I've had.  My next stop will be at breakfast for the pig and grits."}
{"text":"Who puts a BBQ grill in the middle of a car wash? Who cares -- it works!!

I've had the brisket and the pulled pork sandwiches for lunch. Both are excellent. Throw on some hickory BBQ sauce (one of a half dozen options), add a side of potato salad, and a Cherry Pepsi  and brother, you're eatin' good! 

Don't like BBQ? What are you nuts? OK, then go for the Portabella mushroom sandwich or Cheeseburger sliders with chipotle aioli. They got you covered, friend.

Prices are reasonable. The staff is patient with first timers so don't feel intimated and ask all the questions you want. Food comes out quick, I didn't even have time to take my number to a table before my meal was ready. There are two large seating areas, both are quiet and relaxing. I don't know what else to say about this place other than \"It's good, go there!\".

Someday I hope to have my car washed here. In the meantime, Let's EAT!"}
{"text":"I have had my car washed at Toms Thumb many times  and I am very happy with their work...the staff is pleasant and the food is great...I have a crab cake salad which is one of my my favorites...cant ask for anything better..."}
{"text":"Soooo good. Hash browns are my favorite. This whole concept is really nice sitting and having amazing BBQ or a rockstar breakfast while you wait for your car to get washed. Their baked goods are always fresh too."}
{"text":"Love the food and staff, great place for fast barbecue food but my kids dint Carr for it so it's a place my hubby and I will go to alone. We enjoyed breakfast and lunch items here, the brisket is th e best."}
{"text":"How much fun is this place?  The metro area needs more of these.  A car wash, gas station, convenience store, wine shop, gift shop, and BBQ café?!?!  What the heck?  Pinch me!  We picked up some great gifts for upcoming birthdays and some funny things for my husband's fishing trip, and a few beverages for the road.  The food I saw looked excellent.  If we weren't on a mission to Cave Creek, we would have lingered longer.  Now I'm looking for a reason to go back.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Had a fabulous lunch at The Thumb today.  The food was great (as always), atmosphere was awesome...the new fish tank was a hit for my 2 and 4 year olds.  Highly recommend this place for any meal and bring the family.  It's the only place that we regularly take our kids b/c they love seeing all the cool things for sale.  And most importantly...the staff are great: friendly and super helpful.  Kudos to the GM Mike for making this place a big success."}
{"text":"I have tried the BBQ twice and I will not be back. Waited in line over 10 minutes to order then waited 25 minutes for my food. The food was average and over priced.  But if you are looking for a quick bite just grab the a bag of chips."}
{"text":"I had been told great things about this place from several people and with a dirty truck needing to be cleaned, stopped in and tried it out.  

I ordered the sliders with brisket and wow they were good.  Plenty of sauces to choose from and the staff was extremely nice.  

I will say that the time it takes to get the truck clean is on the longer side but they do a very good job, especially when compared to other washes in the area.  

Overall I will be back."}
{"text":"Tom Thumb's Campfire Bistro tacos were the best thing at Yelp's Western Adventure!  Other than the Tequila Bus :-)  I've been to Tom Thumb and eaten at Campfire many times.  Their Yelp event was great fun too.  This morning we took the kids for gingerbread house building event they had.  Terrific as always."}
{"text":"It was good but I didn't think it was great.  I haven't enjoyed a single spot featured on Diners, Drive ins, and Dives. Either Guy Fieri has no taste buds or he just wants every restaurant to love him."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with a very down home atmosphere. I've been twice but only because I live in south Phoenix and it's quite a drive away. I must say the corn is forever on my mine...and the pork and brisket (juicy and tender) is to die for. I can not praise the waitstaff, nor can I complain (just basic service). I truly can't wait for the opportunity to go back!"}
{"text":"This place has the absolute worst service. I thought it was just a fluke the first time I came, but both times I was treated horribly my the girl behind the counter (different girls each time). I can't imagine what they must be going through back there to make them such miserable human beings. It's a shame because the food is actually pretty good. If you try this place, I sincerely hope you don't have Carli ringing you up that day. If so, expect to be blown away by the negativity you receive. So unfortunate."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food-Who knew you can dine in and have outstanding food at the Gas Station ! Eat while you gas up and get a car wash."}
{"text":"OMG SO HAPPY WITH THOSE MEN. I use my jeep. It had so much mud. Those men cleaned and cared for the jeep. I will be seeing them again. Thank you for the service. 
Sincerely Dragg inn Ranch"}
{"text":"Best Mac & Cheese Ever!  Came for breakfast but was late for that.  Decided to have the portobello sandwich, which was awesome.  Needed a side and chose the Mac and cheese.  It was the best I have had  and will surely come back for more."}
{"text":"What an amazing foody paradise. While others are hustling off to big expensive, overly priced restaurants, we filled our bellies with extremely inexpensive but phenomenal BBQ. 

Tonight I had the Pulled Pork platter, with Mexican corn on the Cobb and baked Mac & Cheese. I think I about wet my pants it was so good! Everything from the sauces, the heat profiles, the cold soda, the Texas toast and even the pickles. All done to perfection. 

Oh and they have the cleanest tropical fish tank I've ever seen! LOL 

I almost feel bad recommending this place, because I don't want others to discover this little gem, but alas, i must share. If you haven't tried The Thumb you're missing out. 

My first learned about it from watching diners drive-ins and dives on food TV. Had no idea a little gas station in Scottsdale held the key to my happiness."}
{"text":"I feel like I've worn out my barbecue disclaimer at this point, but as today was my first trip to the The Thumb, its nevertheless important for me to put this out there.  Little Miss BBQ has likely ruined me for most (if not all) other barbecue joints in the valley metro area.  There are plenty of decent serviceable barbecue spots all over town.  But in terms of meat quality Little Miss is still king by a landslide.  Now, that doesn't mean other barbecue in the valley isn't worth exploring, nor does it mean all joints have the same personality.  And The Thumb most definitely has a personality all its own.  A gas station, a car wash, a gift shop, a wine cellar, a bakery, & oh yeah, a barbecue restaurant.  I had heard of (but hadn't seen) their Diners Drive-Ins & Dives appearance awhile back & had read mostly positive reviews, so Saturday at lunch seemed as good a time as any to make my first appearance.

You'll find this multifaceted business located on the southwest corner of 94th Street & Bell in north Scottsdale.  From the outside, the place looks like your standard gas station & car wash.  Inside, its a whole different story.  Walk in through the north building entrance & you're immediately greeted by a neon sign, a big barbecue & bakery counter, segmented restaurant & picnic style seating, a travel station style gift shop & a surprisingly impressive collection of fine wines for sale.  Including seating on the patio outside, I'd guess they can pack in at least 100 at full capacity.

For me, the visit today was all about the barbecue.  To my surprise however, The Thumb is the first barbecue joint I've been to that has barbecue breakfast items.  As they only serve those until 11am I just missed last call on that, but perhaps next time I might explore that further.  For my first go around, I was looking for something of a sampler platter so as to try as much of The Thumb's menu as possible.  The 3 Meat Platter seemed to fit the billing.  Three meats, cornbread, pickles, onions, & your choice of two sides.  For my three meats I went brisket, pulled pork, & pulled chicken.  For the two sides, it was their BBQ beans, & baked mac & cheese.  Here you order at the register & grab a number for your table.  As they were pretty busy, they warned me in advance my food would take about 15 minutes to come out.  So I grabbed a spot & waited.  The Thumb's general manager Mike Lawson actually came by my table while I waited & kindly asked if he could help make my experience 5 star that day.  I thanked him for asking but told him I'd let the product speak for itself once it arrived.

Once the food arrived, I was ready to dig in.  For the record, I ordered the fatty brisket versus the lean (because are we really counting calories here?).  Honestly, the brisket was so-so.  I know, its pretty much impossible to top Little Miss & the meat was okay, but it came out a bit too dry.  It needed some sauce to give it some life.  Fortunately The Thumb does have an excellent house BBQ sauce with just a little heat to give the meat a pick me up.  The pulled pork was juicer & did a better job standing on its own, but was also largely improved by the sauce.  The pulled chicken on the other hand was quite impressive.  Great chunks of juicy smoked meat that didn't need sauce at all to make for a satisfying dish.  I was also very impressed with my two side dishes.  The beans in particular were bursting with different flavors & their baked mac & cheese was super rich & creamy.  Both made for a great smoothing contrast with the meats.  The cornbread on the other hand was pretty forgetful.  I like cornbread to have a bit of a moist texture to go with its crumbly disposition.  This one was really dry & had the texture of raw cornmeal moreso than bread.

I noticed the restaurant was also offering a special dessert for Girl Scout Cookie season called a S'mores Pop.  It was a dark chocolate cube on a stick.  Inside said cube were layers of fudge brownie, chocolate marshmallow, and s'mores cookie crust.  So I walked up to the bakery counter and grabbed one of those for dessert.  A pretty satisfying finish if you're a chocolate fan (and I am) with four different types of chocolate influences working in harmony.  And proceeds from the sale benefited the local Girl Scouts, so that's always a plus.

Total cost for the food, glass of water, and tax came to about $27.  The traditional barbecue mainstays like brisket & pulled pork left much to me desired for me.  But the sides, the pulled chicken, and dessert were solid.  No compliants about the service I received here as the staff is super friendly.  I will give this place another try at some point during breakfast as that has my curiosity.  But in the big picture, Scott Holmes still rules the barbecue genre in this town.  Kipp Lassetter has an intriguing thing going here at the The Thumb, but there's room to improve & hopefully someday earn that 5 star rating they kindly asked of me."}
{"text":"I had my car cleaned and ate lunch.  My car was cleaned well however it was missing the cover to the charging unit in the center console when I was retuned to me.  I did not notice this until later in the day and called.  A younger girl answered my call and told me she would get a manager.  Then she returned to take a message and assured me someone would get back to me that evening or the next morning.  I have yet to receive a call.  I am now left with trying to replace this part for myself.  I asked the girl for the car vacuum debris to be gone through to see if it got sucked up in there- and she said she couldn't make any promises.  So- my loss I suppose- but I don't enjoy now having to replace the part myself, and having paid them to lose a car part.  Additionally- my lunch was OK- it has been better before and my fries were lukewarm/cold.  All said and done I spent about $35 for lunch, a clean car, and now a missing part."}
{"text":"I got to try out the brisket sandwich that was featured on the show \"Dinners, Drive-ins, and Dives\". And it was great. The meat was juicy and I had some good tea to go with it. When I come back the the Scottsdale area in the future, I will know who call when I'm in need of a good BBQ."}
{"text":"Food is great, service was super friendly and the best part, they catered to my German Shepherd! My new favorite spot!!!"}
{"text":"We came to the Gingerbread house decorating event with the twins.  What a great time.  It was nicely organized.  They set the tables in the back and the smaller children had the houses ready to decorate, while the older ones could build them from scratch.  Then they had a table set up with different candies and pretzels and a sample house so you can decide what to do with your house.  The event was amazingly cheap, it was only $10 per child and it included breakfast of eggs, bacon, toast and fruit.  The twins had a blast and enough candy to keep them wired for the rest of the day.  Thank goodness the nanny is coming later."}
{"text":"Bistro? Car Wash? BOTH!  Went here only because the Yelp community said this was the place to go. I thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast sandwich and then watched four detailers attack my truck inside and out until sparkling clean. Very pleased and will return."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! Who would ever think good food could come from a gas station? This is definitely not your ordinary gas station. They have earned their delicious BBQ reputation. Even the shop inside is really cool, different out of the box items."}
{"text":"At the Tom's Thumb Fresh Market 'Diners Drive-ins and Dives' viewing party. Outstanding food. Fantastic crowd."}
{"text":"Had a delicious brisket sandwich with sweet potato fries.  I can't wait to try to Cuban or pulled pork sandwiches next."}
{"text":"This truly IS a one-stop shop!!! From good food, to great wine, to shopping, getting gas, or a car wash!"}
{"text":"Every time we come to Scottsdale, which is often because my daughter, son-in-law and granddaughters live here, We always make it a point to eat lunch and/or dinner and ALWAYS get our cars washed at Tom Thumb for the following reasons:
service fabulous, 
barbecue/food fabulous 
gift shop fabulous 
ambience fabulous 
And the car wash is always far beyond our expectations! BEST CAR WASH IN SOCAL AND ARIZONA!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you.  Some of the best bbq in town.  Get the brisket breakfast."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit here. This place is pretty awesome. Really good food except I'm not into the french fries they have. They are really small and skinny and crispy. Some people probably like this kind of french fries, but not me. 

Anyways, I wish it wasn't raining today because I would have been really into getting my car washed while I munched on a burger.

So yeah, I'm really full right now, time for a nap."}
{"text":"I can't say anything other than amazing!! You just have to eat there to know. It sounds strange at first, but it has the most amazing food ever. I know fries are so-so at most places, but they have the best fries ever. I recommend the brisket sandwich with fries. The best brisket in AZ (that I have had so far)."}
{"text":"Just had my truck wash there and paid for the premium package. My 2 year old could of done a better job washing it. I have gone to many places and by far this is the worst. Also they stole a powerball ticket and when I returned to ask if they have seen it, of course they knew nothing about it. They move all your paperwork inside your car and pretend like they didn't touch a thing. I was my first time there, but also my last time. I only live about a 1/2 mile from here. But will drive farther for better service!!!"}
{"text":"First time at Tom's Thumb. Perhaps last.  I arrived at 5 PM on a Monday and was the only customer aside from the cashiers kids doing their homework. The cashier joked twice about the place being empty. Perhaps a sign?

I ordered the Two-meat Platter that came with two sides. I got brisket and sausage plus Mac N Cheese and Sweet Potato Fries for the sides. I added a small drink for $16.51 plus tip. Not pricey for good BBQ but they were very small portions. I just got hit for a $17 car wash (before tip) outside, which was a couple bucks more than everyone else. Ouch. 

Service in the restaurant was great, other than the wisecracking about being empty. The service at the car wash was 10-minutes slow. Too bad there. 

The link was good. Good flavor, good snap (a must) but a bit small. The brisket was VERY dry. I got two really small strips (like 1\" wide strips) that were so lean and dry I could barely eat them. Perhaps yesterday's batch?  Fortunately a customer came in and I heard the cashier tell him that the BBQ sauce was 'around the corner'. Thank goodness or I would've tossed most of the brisket. 

The fries were very tasty. Good flavor, crunchy exterior yet fluffy inside. The Mac was off. It was way undercooked, plus had an off taste. I had three bites. 

Even my little $1.29 drink came with no refills according to the sign, unless you want to pay more!

I drove 15 miles from work, in the opposite direction of home, only to be majorly disappointed. 

Prob no revisit, sadly, cuz I love BBQ."}
{"text":"Our party of 10 went for lunch. We are all seniors and our server Sara bent over backwards to accommodate us at a low seated table. The food was delicious.  Especially the pork and brisket. The highlight was our server Sarah who was kind, engaging and so accommodating we look forward to returning. The gift shop was unique, quirky and a great end to our visit!"}
{"text":"The food is decent. However, if you are coming to grab a quick bite after a long day... Don't. The staff is not friendly and lack common courtesy. Very disappointed in the customer service."}
{"text":"Sometimes places featured on tv don't live up to the hype but Thumbs does. Wow! BBQ for breakfast that rivals Kansas City bbq. Pigs and grits... Creamy grits that are peppery and delicious. Juicy pork, amazing flavors! Accommodated my need for baked beans in the morning. Did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today and had a great chat with Mike about my last visit. A true class act. Ventured outside my usual box today and tried the smoked sausage. WOW. I may have a new go-to. A must try for all!"}
{"text":"Updated review due to mike the GM contacting us and doing his best to make it right. 85% of the time the experiences have been good the other 15 not so much but he's done a good job trying to right the ship.the food has always been excellent"}
{"text":"Excellent place to get a bit to eat. I had salad and half brisket sandwich. The salad was delicious, it had more than your regular house salad. The sandwich had brisket falling off, that's how much brisket was in it. Would make a trip to go there."}
{"text":"Great BBQ while you wait for your car to get washed.  Plus they give a 5 day rain check that is nice in case your car gets dumped on."}
{"text":"Ordered the 3 meat plate, thinking the plate was big enough for 2 but the portions were small and the food was cold for the amount of wait time that we waited for our food. The sides were also cold. Will pick Famous Daves any time.... Sorry, Guy I think you got this one wrong. Will not be returning and will not recommend."}
{"text":"The brisket stacker was the bomb!   Spoke with the boss Michael tonight who was a great host and listened to any comments we had.  I def recommend this joint for the smoked bbq and great car wash.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town...and a great carwash..I drive out of my way every week to come here mostly for the carwash and occasionally will treat myself to the BBQ especially the BBQ tacos (get one of each meat)

I wish they sold bottles of their BBQ sauces instead of in the styrofoam containers.

In short ..everything here is excellent!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! This place rocks!!! I love getting the 3 little pigs- 3 different sliders: brisket, pork and beef. That way I get a little bit of everything. All their different barbecue sauces are incredible too. I especially like the habanero, North Carolina and the xxx varieties. And the shoestring fries? They are so additive! The service is top notch and drink refills are always prompt. This is the beat BBQ I've had in a long time and who'd have guessed I'd find it in a gas station??"}
{"text":"Ms. Tudie has done it again. Awesome food. You may not find it on the menu, but ask for the gumbo. Best you will find anywhere. 

Loved the atmosphere. It has a kitchen table comfortable feel. Excellent service. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Yummy! This is my new go to for great BBQ. The pulled pork and brisket platter is fantastic. The only thing I wasn't a fan of is the coleslaw and not because it isn't good but because I like a cream based coleslaw to go with my pulled pork and this one is more of a light salad style.

Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I regret the fact that I've lived like a mile from this place for almost two years and only recently finally got around to giving it a shot.  I had always heard of it as \"a gas station with really good BBQ\" and I think the gas station part just kept me thinking of roller dogs and crusty nacho cheese.  Once you walk in, this place is more like a BBQ joint merged with an antique store than anything that would resemble the inside of a Shell.  Maybe there actually is the typical inside part to the gas station through another door?  I honestly wasn't really looking.

The menu has a lot to choose from.  I tried the 3 Little Pigs, which is essentially three sliders.  You can choose from chicken, pork, & brisket, and mix & match however you want.  Since it was my first visit, I thought what better way to try all three.  Each one was really, really good, to the point where I will likely just continue to order this every time I go.  My wife got the pulled pork sandwich and also gave it a big thumbs up.  For sides, we tried the sweet potato fries and the baked mac & cheese, both of which were also really good.  I was kind of in a rush and was getting my order to-go, so instead of exploring all their BBQ sauce options I just grabbed a bunch of the regular and left.  There must have been at least five or six kinds to choose from.  Anyway, the regular sauce was delicious.

I'm pretty happy that I feel like I found my new go-to BBQ place, and even better, it's so close by.  Definitely give it a shot, and check out all their random stuff for sale while you wait."}
{"text":"Not only is the bbq close to me but I can also get gas and a car wash at the same location lol. The food is really good but the sauce is just so so and thats the only reason it's not getting a 5 star."}
{"text":"What a truly pleasant surprise...good food in a car wash/convenience store...who would have thought?  The service was AMAZING...very helpful and right there when you needed it!  Nice, relaxing atmosphere that honestly didn't feel like you were eating in a car wash/convenience store.  The BBQ platter with a 1/4 chicken, macaroni salad and potato salad was quite tasty,  but way too big of a portion for me!  They recommended a few different sauces for me and they were both delicious.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Most excellent breakfast lunch or dinner fare ! I challenge you to find a meal you won't love."}
{"text":"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!
I've had the pleasure to visit this oasis tonight for a Yelp event I was lucky enough to be invited by an Elite.  
First of all, let me start off by saying my car wash was great my car smells of vanilla (total chick scent).
This place is AMAZING.  I am disappointed in myself that I had not been here sooner.  This place is crazy cool.  It has a coffee bar, a bakery, a restaurant with great BBQ, a convenience store, plenty of fancy market items like this homemade butter that one of my friends raves about.  It's a gift store as well.  There were plenty of items I wanted for myself.  Tons of greeting cards for all occasions and for all types of personalities. They've got the sweet birthday cards with pictures of beautiful flowers on them and then they've got the crazy humor birthday cards with 2 old ladies on the front of them talking about the slut in the nursing home, which is my kind of cards I love to give.  
They sell wine by the bottle. This is not like the wine selection you see in Circle K. This is the selection you'd see in Cost Plus or AJ's. 
The bakery, ohhh the bakery.... Was yummy. They had beautiful cakes you could have custom made. Take a look at the pics I posted. These ladies are talented.  They made cupcakes, cookies, beautiful cakes, chocolates and cinnamon rolls. My friend and I got excited about the cupcakes and she talked to these incredible ladies about custom cupcakes for the Breaking Bad finale.  We encouraged them to sell these cupcakes for the finale.  I will post a picture when we get them. For all you Heisenberg fans, lets just say these cupcakes will be blue.   Looking forward to ordering more themed cupcakes in the future. 
Toms Thumb Fresh Market has many areas for you to sit and hang while waiting for your car to get washed or to have a bite or a drink.  I'm looking forward in sitting in the Avaition Chairs that I had seen at Restoration Hardware the week before.... Yeah, the chairs are over $1,500 each!
There is nothing bad I can say about this GEM.  I know I' missing tons of other things about this place.  My mind is blown over everything in Tom's Thumb Fresh Market.  I'm just looking forward to go back."}
{"text":"Update: Michael went out of his way to make things right and earned a customer for life as a result. It must've just been an off day the previous time as this time around everything was simply phenomenal. The brisket was super tender and juicy and paired perfectly with the sauces. Mac and cheese rivaled that of home. A whole world of improvement and so many more menu items to try. I will definitely be back and will bring people back with me whenever they're in the area."}
{"text":"We didn't try out the car wash but we came for lunch.  I was craving BBQ & this place looked really neat from the reviews.  The little shopping area inside was really cute, tons of different things that would make great gifts for people.  It's like the fancy version of the store in Cracker Barrel ;)

I ordered the BBQ Brisket sandwich without the aioli & hubby ordered the Cuban.  The few tables that were in the area were dirty & still had plates on them.  We found a worker & asked if they could clean it off for us.  She was very sweet & super apologetic.  No big deal.  Our food finally came out & my sandwich had TONS of the aioli.  I brought it up & asked for a new one, they were once again very apologetic.  My new sandwich came out quickly but I noticed it was so fatty with actual chunks of fat in the sandwich. Now I know brisket isn't always the leanest but this was just beyond normal.  I took out the pieces that were just pure fat & was left with a few pieces of brisket.  The brisket itself was very flavorful & the sauces you can choose from were great but for the price I can't say that I will be rushing here again.  Maybe it was just an off day? Everyone seemed to love their BBQ sandwiches. My husband raved about his sandwich, he didn't have any fatty pieces in his that he noticed."}
{"text":"Great concept in a car wash/gas station!  The food is fantastic you will love it.  The desserts are great too!"}
{"text":"I just had an amazing pulled pork sandwich at Tom Thumb. Tryed this unique place after reading a review in Phoenix Magazine. Just delicious. You can get your car washed, gas, shop, and buy fine wine. It is being featured on Dives, Dinners and Drive- ins tonight."}
{"text":"Great BBQ in a unique setting.  Will be a regular from now on! Food is great service is good and location is convenient.  Brisket is amazing.  They have some very unique dishes that eventually I plan on trying all of them."}
{"text":"I've stood in line at Franklin's in Austin, TX and at Little Miss BBQ in Phoenix. The Thumb is my next choice when I don't wanna stand in line for hours for Great BBQ. The sauces are great, XXX is super spicy but AWSOME on the brisket which was moist and not dry. The Habanero sauce is spicy and sweet and perfect with the pulled pork. The baked Mac-n-Cheese is perfectly awesome!! I'm from South Mississippi so I know good greens and the collards are right there with Granny's! Stop here, wash your car, fill up your tank and grab some AWESOME BBQ. I'll bet you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Did we go to a different place than everyone else writing a review here?

We went for the BBQ and really really really wanted to like this place. We give it one-half star for better than average pulled pork, another half for the wonderfully weird environment (including a rather nice wine and beer selection...in a car wash no less),  and another whole star for an array of truly delicious BBQ sauces. 

As to the rest...not so good. The ribs were a huge disappointment. The online menu says \"St. Louis ribs\"; the in-house menu doesn't say. In fact they were baby backs which we don't care for. Much, much worse: THEY DON'T SMOKE THEM AT ALL! We were told the ribs are \"baked\" (we thought they'd been boiled, but what's the difference after all), had little or no seasoning or rub on them, and came out slightly mushy and totally tasteless.
 
The brisket was rather dry and had little flavor. On the other hand, the sweet potato fries were great. The mac and cheese was decent as were the baked beans. The vinegar cole slaw could have been great but wasn't.

The peach cobbler (which they gave us for free because we voiced that we didn't care for the ribs) was inedible: a few of the erratically sized slices of fruit were cooked perfectly while many others were rock hard and raw. We tasted only sugar. 

It seemed to us that whoever was in the kitchen simply didn't care."}
{"text":"This is pretty easy. They nailed it! Looks like an ordinary gas station and car wash facility from the outside, but they offer so much more. We were really impressed with all of the BBQ offerings, the diversity of general merchandise items in the store and the decent service. No car wash or coffee shop items on our visits so far, but we'll come back again to clean the rides and enjoy more goodies. Definitely had my eye on some cupcakes. Well done. Great concept executed perfectly."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ at a very unlikely spot. Most people don't expect to have a gas station with such an outstanding menu. What I love best is as you wait in line there are adorable items for sale in the shop they have. Awesome gifts!!!"}
{"text":"Killer BBQ at the thumb. Had the 3 meat platter -brisket, sausage, pulled pork -. Brisket was amazing. Sausage was very good. Pulled pork was very good. Sides of beans and creamy coleslaw were popping. Service was first class all the way, but they werent slammed. No less than 3 employees including the manager asked how my meal was and if they could get me anything else. When I finished my meal the manager asked if I was full? I said no and then he brought out a mini crock of Mac n Cheese on him! This is a must go to place when I'm in the Tempe - Phoenix area. You might not think this is the best BBQ you ever had if your a BBQ snob, but it will definitely be in your top 5! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food here is good! Great BBQ. I usually order the brisket salad, yummy!!! If you get this salad ask them to cut up the brisket for you as it's a pain to do it yourself. Brisket is good, not the best I've eaten but worth the price of the salad. Cuban sandwich is bomb.com - IT IS AMAZING!!!! 

Prices are a little high but if you're in the mood for some BBQ you gotta stop here and try it out."}
{"text":"The first time I heard about Tom Thumb was in mid August 2016 when I was flying home from a vacation. My seat mate and I were chatting and he told me about Tom Thumb and how great the food and just the atmosphere was; a fun place to go. Didn't think much more about it until my BABS group mentioned a lunch get together at Tom Thumb! We went today and it was wonderful in all aspects. We were a group of 17, they suggested we come early 10:30am for lunch as they get busy; wise choice. We ordered at the counter and were served promptly with no errors. When I first walked in, the BBQ smell was tantalizing! I had the chopped brisket and it was one of the best I've ever had. I tried a friends pulled pork and it was to die for. You could tell everything was fresh. They had great BBQ sauces for every taste: Texas spicy, Kansas City sweet and smoky, vinegar based, and more. In addition, the Caprese Sandwich, another friend had, looked awesome, you could tell it was fresh made mozzarella. And the desserts... The lemon torte was perfect, not too sweet, perfectly tart with a very freshly made crust. The double/triple chocolate brownie was so wonderfully dense, it was hard to get a fork through it!
Not just a foodie place, they have a wonderful gift shop with very interesting and unique items to browse and buy. I got the platter to go for my dinner and probably tomorrows lunch: 2 meats(chopped brisket, pulled pork), 2 sides (coleslaw, potato salad), cornbread... only $15, enough for 2-3 meals for me. I'm definitely going back :)"}
{"text":"I wish I'd had visited sooner! I've lived about 5 min north of here for over a year and never stopped by. Went this morning and purchase \"the thumb\" wash. Waiting about 20-30 minutes with the level of care and attention the spent was just fine with me. The only complaint I can think of is that it isn't touch less. Other than that, awesome store, good service. A true one stop shop!

Update 2-20-2016

So I paid to have the $199.99 exterior detail done, have to admit I'm slightly disappointed. I understand it's a Saturday morning and they're busy, but I dropped the car off at 8:00am and when I got home there were definitely some \"oversights\" on the cleanup (see photos) I wax my car at home typically but I was lazy and had his done. I can't recommend the detail services. The carwash is great, though. Wax on the rubber trim, dirt on the wheel wells.. Oh well. I cleaned it up when I got home (1 mile drive). The tire gel wasn't even on the tires or rubber dressing. Anyways I digress

Update:

Mike went out of his way to make things right. I now can say without a doubt the detail services at Tom's are the best in the valley! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend any of their services to friends or family! What are waiting for!? Stop by and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Living off of 94th St and Legacy, this was my go-to place for many things.. Beer, smokes and food."}
{"text":"This place is our favorite locally owned business! It's a North Scottsdale gem where you are likely to run into neighbors, guaranteed delicious food, and can leave with an expertly detailed car. The staff is friendly and engaging and the gift shop always carries quirky and unique items. Do not pass by and be deceived by the gas station facade... inside is a local hub of activity and enjoyment. We LOVE \"The Thumb\" Also, this business gives back to the local community generously, and we love them for that!"}
{"text":"Gas. Car Wash. Home Decor. Gift Shop. Convenience Store. Bakery. BBQ. 
Yes to all above.

We came for the BBQ and after a couple of missteps we ended up having a very nice meal.  I ordered a smoked chicken sandwich and my husband ordered a 2 meat platter. We both had the baked mac & cheese as a side and my husband also added some sweet potato fries. 

I had a few pieces of bone/cartilage in my sandwich, but the chicken was moist and flavorful. Initially my husband wasn't quite as lucky as his sliced brisket was extraordinarily dry despite his being able to douse it in one of their many different homemade bbq sauces. To Tom Thumb's credit, after my husband brought it to their attention they immediately replaced it with a generous portion of some chopped brisket which was far moister. His pulled pork was never a problem and was really good. 

The sides were decent - not the best that I have ever had but I still didn't leave a bite! My husband's fries were a little under and could have been crisped up a wee bit. 

Overall, a 3.5 with the potential for more."}
{"text":"The food is good y'all!... This is original BBQ so it is only fitting I dust my Texan lingo. In all seriousness the food is seriously good. They got a great menu and then, it comes out of the kitchen, and back it up. Taste, presentation and portions are all good. And don't let the gas station facade fool ya'... They're cooking in here. Just be careful with baby James. You'll find it in the BBQ sauce section. Thinking it is a full grown BBQ sauce you may drop more than needed on your plate if you're not paying attention, because it's almost watery, but it may not be a bad thing because is delicious. My fave actually. They have a lot of people working at this place. I always see different faces. Overall I enjoyed my last couple of visits, so this time around this place gets a yeehahh."}
{"text":"This is an interesting and unique place to eat. The employees tend to be polite. The music is always too loud.

The food is good. The pancakes are among the best I have ever had. However, customers eat with plastic knives and forks. The pancake syrup served is cheap-quality store-bought syrup. In a restaurant this expensive, it should include real silverware, and real maple.

There is a good variety of barbeque sauces available, but they are served room temperature. I would rather have fewer choices, but have them available in crock-pots kept warm. I have found the meats and sandwiches are typically good, but the side dishes are rather bland."}
{"text":"Gas Station with a legit restaurant.  Being from Texas, I'm pretty critical of BBQ.  This place passes the test.  The breakfast taco's are my favorite.  Really impressed with the habanero sauce.  ."}
{"text":"Great food with friendly service.  The BBQ sauces are exceptional, the cornbread is unbelievably moist, and the corn on the is cob beyond delicious.  The line can be a bit long, but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Odd and amazing combination of things. Stopped into get my car wash and there is wine, beer on draft, desserts, pastries, coffee, bbq, great patio and the cutest gift shop...and gas station of course. I was in no rush waiting for my car. Getting my car washed is a treat now! And none of it is mediocre \"gas station\" quality. The food or the gift shop is definitely worth dropping in by itself! Thank you to the genius person for thinking outside the box. Brilliant concept!"}
{"text":"Went today, food is amazing!!! We love bbq been to all the local places and this is definitely the best. The meat is quality and not over seasoned, you can enjoy the smokey flavor or add some of a variety of bbq sauces. The sides are really great too, delicious collard greens with andouille sausage and the baked mac is ungodly.  Now on to the service, got a car wash, guys were awesome and really thorough. Inside, It's fast casual, you order at the counter and they bring the food to your table but no actual servers. The design is a little overwhelming, there is a lot to see, so friendly people at the cash register would be nice to feel welcome."}
{"text":"A surprising stop for lunch. This gas station/ market is located off of the freeway in a semi remote area next to the airpark. Don't let the gas station appeal steer you away from giving the awesome food a shot.

I would compare this deli/ restaurant to something found at a high class resort."}
{"text":"I've always drove past this place when going to the Ice Den, but never went in for some reason. Then I heard that it was on DDD and being the foodie I am, I had to go. Guy loved the brisket, and let me tell you so did I!!! It was fantastic I got the brisket hash for breakfast while my girlfriend got the Breakfast Tacos! We plan on coming back. 

The store is a little pricey but there are SUPER CUTE things in their to buy. So beware you might blow your bank account if you start shopping while waiting for your food or coffee."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal!

Had the three tacos- 2 brisket, 1 chicken. The brisket is moist but not too flavorful, but the chicken was awesome. Also got baked Mac and cheese side which was simply incredible.

Girlfriend got the bleu brisket salad which was huge and had plenty of brisket on top.

Also kudos to the sweet potato fries.

I definitely won't be missing this place next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Such good barbecue, and the gas station had a really cool shop full of little gifts, a lot of which were Arizona-specific.  
I got the brisket platter with mac and cheese, which was amazing.  There was so much food that I have enough for another full meal of left overs. 
The decor was really nice, and they have a giant fishtanks decorated with license plates."}
{"text":"I'm not exactly what you'd call motivated when it comes to cleaning my own car. I'd rather pay someone to wash and vacuum it while I sit back and read a magazine. So places like this are right up my alley. My last visit was unfortunate, I left unimpressed and decided I wouldn't be back. But, since my car needed some TLC, I was torn on where to go. 
Michael, the general manager had contacted me on Yelp asking for a second chance, although, I usually don't jump at second chances, even if they're free. My Yelp reviews can't be bought. I don't care how much free food and service you throw at me, if it's not good, I'm not going to say it is. 
I decided I'd take Michael up on his deal because it's one of the few places I wanted to give a second chance to and boy am I glad we did. 
We came in Saturday for an interior and exterior wash. I dropped my car off and let the cashier know I was looking for Michael. He promptly greeted us, apologized for my previous visit and assured me this time would be different. He told us to order breakfast or lunch and it would be on him. 
I ordered the breakfast tacos with chicken, it's not on the menu but since I don't eat the suggested meat options, I went rogue. OH. MY. GOD. Those were the best tacos I've ever had in my life. At this point, I didn't care if my car looked like they went off-roading instead of cleaning it. I was hooked. 
Michael stopped by to check on our breakfast and suggested we grab some sauces. It's very rare I don't douse whatever I'm eating in sauce, but there was NO need for any flavor, I actually thought it might ruin my breakfast. On my second taco I did try some of the salsa that came with my breakfast and it was fantastic. 
My fiancé ordered pulled pork and eggs. I didn't pay much attention to what he was eating since I dove into those tacos like a fat kid who hadn't ate in a week (it wasn't a pretty sight). But, he definitely made a point to say he would order that same breakfast again in a heartbeat. 
When our plates were empty, Michael stopped back by to offer us desert. There is no way I'm fitting anything else inside of my belly. But, sure why not? So he brought us a banana cupcake that was to-die-for. I knew we were receiving \"special treatment\" but he went above and beyond. While we were eating our cupcake, I noticed he took another table one to try on the house. He wasn't just treating us like royalty, he was treating others that way too. 
Michael went above and beyond to make sure we were pleased. 
Now it was time for the car reveal, it was spotless, my car looked brand new all over again. It would have been nice if they had vacuumed out the random cookie crumbs from the cup holder, but overall, the job they did was just like my first few visits. I was impressed. 

Needless to say, we will be back. Even if it's not to get my car washed, just for those tacos."}
{"text":"The best gas station barbecue west of the Mississippi. Also they have amazing pancakes"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food. Nice patio. Long line at lunch but if your getting your car washed. It's about the same wait. Wish they severed breakfast later then 11 - especially on the weekends. Here's a suggestion. Please wipe off the outside tables after you clear. Just witnessed 2 employees clear 4 tables and did not wipe one of them. That explains the dirt on the bottoms of my plate."}
{"text":"Wow.  Disappointing.  There is a chain of BBQ places in Texas called bill millers.  Their food is mediocre by texas standards but their BBQ beats the heck out of Tom Thumb.

This place is so overrated.  Pricing is stupid.  $11 for a brisket sandwich!  No by the pound sales.

Ate at little miss BBQ yesterday and it was kick ass.  This place pretty much sucks.

Cannot recommend.  Generously 1.5*."}
{"text":"High prices, small portions and flavorless food all served with just the right amount of attitude. Just another typical overpriced Scottsdale snack shop. 

I came here with some friends who said it was on DDD. I was pretty excited since I have eaten at a few different places that have been on that show and they were all great. The place wasn't busy on a Saturday. This is unusual for ANY good restaurant but even more unusual for a place that has been on DDD. 

I ordered the BBQ tacos. I got one of each pulled chicken, pulled pork and brisket. 10 minutes later one person in the group gets their food. Another 10 minutes goes by and I get my food. 10 minutes later a waitress comes by to take the number holder away and asked us if everyone got their food. Two of the people in the group had not. Another 5 minutes goes by and here comes their food which wasn't what they ordered. Instead of just fixing the problem the waitress wanted to argue with us about how it was ordered. No apologies but she finally fixed the order. We all ordered at the same time. How hard is it to get everyone's order out all at once? 

On to the the food review. The 3 tacos I ordered were probably the smallest tacos I have ever seen. They were the size of small street tacos in Mexico. The ones you pay $2 for 3 tacos. This was $13 with a small drink. OK better ingredients the more they cost right? I'm good with that. To begin with the tacos were cold. I waited 20 minutes for 3 cold tacos. They are BBQ so in theory the meat is already cooked so I should have waited 5 minutes to get them. The slaw on top was so dried out it was basically cabbage. The chicken and pork were flavorless. I couldn't tell the difference between the them. One was very greasy so I assume that was the pork but I'm still not sure. The brisket was just average. At least I could tell it apart from the other two. I had to give them some flavor so I smothered them in BBQ sauce. They have a lot of different BBQ sauces to choose from..... now I know why.

Give another place a try unless you are not that hungry and want some gas station food. It's not worth the money."}
{"text":"Cute place and great bbq! The service is also always on point! They also have catering options and delicious desserts."}
{"text":"I loved every bite! The environment was clean, fun and all the employees were extremely friendly. The restrooms are clean."}
{"text":"I love Tom's Thumb and go frequently on my lunch break with my friends from work. However, today when we went for lunch, there was a short, curly black hair in my coleslaw. It was disgusting and I definitely lost my appetite. When I brought it to the attention of the waiter the response was \"Oh my.\" He took the side of coleslaw away but neglected to apologize or even bring out a new side of coleslaw. At that point I wasn't very hungry anymore but it seems like the situation should have been handled much differently! Terrific food but I was very disappointed with today's experience."}
{"text":"This is a really neat spot. The barbecue is fantastic, there's all sorts of neat gifts and nice  wine's to purchase. The bakery is absolutely unbelievable. Kelly made the best birthday cake I have ever eaten and I can't thank her enough for the wonderful job she did.

 Now on to the car wash. I have gone to Cobblestone many times and left disappointed with a below average job on my car but a significantly above average price. Every single staff member is fantastic to deal with. No one has ever been rude to me and they go out of their way to ensure that the job is done perfectly.

There is no high-pressure to purchase additional services or any washes above what you ask for. There is no one looking to fix scratches on your windshield and asking for your insurance information to pay for the services. I know two employees by name who recognize me every time I come in. If you have a chance asked to speak with Jason or Billy, they are remarkable employees and the owner of this business should feel blessed that he has them at his store.

As far as some of the other reviews go, the barbecue is excellent. I am from Texas and I smoke my own meat at home. Their food is consistently aboveboard and is fairly priced. If you're looking for a great lunch spot while getting your car washed this is the only place in north Scottsdale to go."}
{"text":"The food is always excellent. I enjoy the atmosphere. I don't recommend the car wash services as the 2 times I've used them I've had to go back with miscellaneous complaints. But the food and gas is great. Would be a 5 star, but the last couple of times I've ordered for pick up I ended up waiting even though I ordered 30 minutes ago. There's a big bald guy and whenever he's around things always seem to be running more smoothly, but when he's not around it's long wait times and chaos."}
{"text":"Food is great but service is going down hill ... They asked me what kind of dressing I wanted tonight and then put nothing on?  Had to drive back up and was not treated as expected ... Disappointing"}
{"text":"This is a very neat and trendy gas station eatery with lovely atmosphere.  The food is tasty and the decor is warm and inviting.  They have a wide beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Learned about Tom's from a friend and went there for dinner.  I had the smoked half chicken, my wife had the pulled pork sliders and a friend had the smoked \"two meat\" plate.  Overall I would rate it as very good.  The barbecue sauces (7 or 8 choices) were excellent as were the meals.  The service was attentive and quick.  Don't expect ambiance, it is a gas station after all (although it's a few hours later and I still don't have gas). I think the only \"ding\" I would give is that the french fries were not hot enough to my liking.  But other then that expect a nice menu and really fine food.

I would like to update my review just for consistancy.  It is now July 2016 and I've continued to enjoy Tom's many times.  The french fries have been better, the staff is still great, and I have had their collard greens, and if you're a fan of greens these are as good or better then any I've ever had (and I've travelled extensively in the south).  They've gone from menu service to ordering yourself but they still deliver your order to your table.  Still a wonderful place to enjoy a meal with friends."}
{"text":"Toms Thumb is out standing food is hot and fresh with outstanding taste. It goes to show you the pride they take making sure there food is the best. It does not just stop at the food the customer service is some of the best that I have ever had. They really care about there customers and thrive to make your you are happy and feel welcomed. When you want to have great barbecue and want to be treated like family head over to Toms Thumb and give them a try. They will not let you down."}
{"text":"Well, a Southern girl looking for BBQ got a few recommendations for this place. I ordered the brisket stack. She asked if I wanted lean or moist. I asked for moist, not realizing that I was going to get a plate full of fat. I ate what little meat there was and left behind a plate full of \"food\" that I just couldn't stomach. My boyfriend's pulled pork was quite tasty. The sauces are amazing.  I particularly liked the mustard version. I went home and got sick, but I just can't handle that much fat. The little meat I had was smoky and flavorful. My experience wasn't great, but I'd try it again with a different meat."}
{"text":"We've been here three times and we like it so we keep going back, but today we went for lunch and my husband and I both got the chopped salad.  They were VERY small with not much chicken either.  definitely not worth the $10. Total disappointment."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite BBQ I've had since moving to Arizona 4 years ago. I come from the south, so BBQ is important to me, and The Thumb never disappoints with their quality and flavor. Loves the BBQ sauces as well! I always find myself browsing the gift shop in the gas station with a BBQ smile on my face after eating here."}
{"text":"Well, now that the remodeled barbeque section has reopened we finally got a chance to try out their food and it was great!  The pulled chicken, brisket and pulled pork were all very tasty.  I would have given 5 stars, but the not so great part was having to wait almost a half hour for our order.  Despite the wait we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I found this place a while back while working up in the area. I was super excited to find out it was featured on triple D. I tell EVERYONE about this place. The food is awesome! They have a bunch of cool little trinkets to shop through while you wait. They have a car wash, I've never used it but it's nice to have all these amenities in one spot. One of the coolest things I just found out is that they have RACING FUEL at the palms. 95 and 100 octane!!!! they just redid the restaurant portion so there's way more room to handle the crazy crowds that this place brings my favorite is the full stack and the pig grits. Good luck!"}
{"text":"What a cool and fun place.  Lots of eclectic weird stuff everywhere, so you can always browse for amusement while waiting.  And some cool nice products, like a really fantastic hand lotion I've never seen anywhere else, and candles with unique scents.

The food is stunningly good, prepared every day starting at 4am."}
{"text":"Let me tell you a story about a place formerly named \"Tom's Thumb\"

If nothing more, ya gotta try it to say you had lunch or dinner in a Car Wash/Gas Station.  The kind of place that makes you want to pass the vittles across the green felted dining table with pool cues.  And if that's what it takes to get you there, then I've provided a good service today.  You're welcome.

Hopefully all I really need to do is tell you I've had fantastic pork and brisket meals here - every time I wonder why I don't come more often.  I'm fixing that now.  

I took a friend last time, and I was totally impressed with my lunch, and gained many MANY friend points with a new Phoenix resident.  No skimping ANYWHERE.  I had the Brown Bag Special. It's their pulled pork sandwich with chips and a regular drink.  I upgraded to fries.  The bun was fresh and perfect.  Large by lunch standards.  A very large scoop (a Heaping Helping?) of pulled pork - moist and delicious ... and an ample amount of perfectly cooked fries served hot.  Their varied sauces (on their sauce bar) are fantastic - I felt a little disloyal as I tried to sample every one of them - and even though I loved one, I'd move on to the next one, just to love it as well.  

Anyway - the menu is very good, priced appropriately.  Service - fantastic.  Our server appeared to truly enjoy his job, and checked back to see if we needed anything - great hospitality.  Awesome!  

There are a ton of things in the store for folks to check out - reminds me of \"Cracker Barrel\" without the \"made in china\" feeling (no - I'm sure it's all made in the good ol' US of A, but it always looks mass produced there).  Here - the perfect place to find that \"one of a kind\" gift for your mom, grandma, or anyone with a sense of humor or has a country feel to their home.  Lots of seasonal decor items as well.

This summer - I think for my annual pool party - I'm going to save myself some work - and put in an order at The Thumb for catering.  I'm salivating thinking of the great food - and the ability to spend more time with my friends, and less in the kitchen!

All summed up - I'm thinking the Ballad of Jed Clampett (Modified) is appropriate here... 

Well, now it's time to say goodbye to TOM and all his kin
They would like to thank you folks for kindly dropping in
You're all invited back again to this locality (9393 East Bell Rd, Scottsdale, AZ 85260)
To have a heaping helping of their hospitality
(Scottsdale Hillbillies, that's what they call 'em now
Nice folks, Y'all come back now, hear?)"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food, atmosphere and staff are all exceptional. I really love the breakfast tacos! And, they have the best car wash in town."}
{"text":"The brisket stack was phenomenal, Mike the GM came to check on our table and had a great conversation with my wife and I. It is refreshing to get both exceptional food and service. My wife loves the pork and grits. Special kudos go out to Charles in the kitchen !!!   We will be back - open a Peoria location !!!! 

Visited on April 29.  Have previously given this place five stars... While the brisket stack today was again excellent - they changed the portion on their other signature dish - the pigs and grits as shown on DDD.   Tonight's dish was all grits and very little pig, the pig that it did have contained some bone, and overall it was extremely dry no sauce

Tonight I give it a 2 star and this was about our eighth trip overall and we are very disappointed

May 2 update -  As noted in the above reviews, I have been to the Thumb many times before and it has been beyond excellent on every occasion except the last. My intent on the review of last week was not to be overly critical but only to let Mike know of my experience. Mike as an owner, visits the tables, checks on his customers, and is known for his friendliness and follow up. Well -- Mike saw my review, contacted me personally and offered to send me a gift card to make up for the one less than perfect experience that I had. I could not be more impressed with Mike following up and caring about me and his customer base, you see far too little of that in today's society

I will head back to Tom Thumb as soon as possible -- I highly recommend it, the menu items as seen on DDD are exceptional.  Thank you Mike for reaching out, thank you for caring about your customer base, thank you for caring about your establishment and the product that you present, you are indeed a class act sir

Mike - May 5th.   A DAMN INCREDIBLE meal at the THUMB.   Anyone who has not eaten here and sampled the pork or the brisket is missing out !!!"}
{"text":"We were really excited to try their BBQ after seeing it highlighted on DDD. I'm originally from Kansas City and have a love for great BBQ. The drive from Gilbert took about 40 minutes and I was not disappointed. Mike and Bill took care of me and recommended the chopped beef and collard greens. Both were delicious! I've not had collard greens before and really liked them. Looking forward to the next time I visit this excellent restaurant. Thank you for taking care of me."}
{"text":"DDD got this right! We frequent this gas station but never dreamt of eating there. I always thought eating at a gas station was, well, gross but decided to try this place after seeing it DDD. Tom's food is actually really good food! The BBQ is tender, the Mac and Cheese is ON POINT and NOT DRY, and although we can't stand Cole slaw, theirs is darn good! Sampling most, or all, the barbecue sauces at the bbq bar is a must if you are trying any of the meats for the first time and like variety. 

The sweets in the glass case, although I don't think it's necessarily part of Tom's Thumb (the beautiful display case as you walk out), are all prepared a real pastry chef! She is AMAZING! About $5 per piece per dessert, and although small if you aren't stuffed, it's all WELL worth every single penny."}
{"text":"Cute store, good food but employees need a course in how to provide good customer service. Everyone we encountered was business like. Not one of the employees we dealt with would look us in the eye and gave us only begrudging answers. Will comeback on a different day to see if it's just the Sunday crew or if it's company policy."}
{"text":"Pulled up to a car wash and thought I was being punked by friends.  Turns out this place has quite the charm.  The BBQ isn't bad either.  I love that there is a bunch of BBQ styles to choose from, so I can pick what suits my mood."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING!! The service is great and always super friendly! We eat here at least once a week, my husband loves the 3 little pigs, I love the tacos and bistro salad with grilled chicken. They have great options for our 3 kids that they all love! We just had them cater our last party. Tons of delicious brisket, pulled pork and chicken to make sandwiches and sliders!  Everyone absolutely loved it! Definitely will be catering again!!"}
{"text":"My 2nd time stopping here. Tried the brisket sandwich the first time back in the Spring. Was pleasantly surprised as to how good it was at a gas station and car wash that serves food. I guess I should say this is really a great BBQ joint that also sells gas and washes cars. BTW they do that really well too. 
Today I tried the Tom's Brisket Stack as featured on Diners Drive Ins and Dives. It was excellent. Has just the right seasoning and cooked to perfection. The egg really adds a nice touch. Also tried a cup of the chili. They use shredded and chunks of beef. No hamburger here. Has a nice amount of heat, but not over powering. Really good on those cold Phoenix days. Lol."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The gift shop has really fun things - the baked items are Delish and the smoked meat is amazing. I'm in AZ for a hockey tournament and went here twice.. Want to go again before we leave."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. I especially like the blacken catfish. Also the bbq tacos are really good. All this at a freaking has station"}
{"text":"We are in Scottsdale for a week at a friends timeshare.  When we checked in the staff told us about the supermarkets and big chain restaurants that were close... they didn't mention this place.  I don't know why and I am going to ask! It was right down the street from the Links.  I was Google-ing BBQ in Scottsdale and this DDD spot came up.  We went early afternoon on Monday.  I pick odd times to eat whenever I can as the Guy Feiri review ruined my favorite burger place in Sacramento and now it is overrun whenever it is open. Anyway, I asked what Guy had and the waitress showed us the brisket stack.  I split it with my daughter.  It was seriously the bomb!  I would have like a tad more aioli on the hash browns... but I was so busy keeping my mouth full I didn't ask before it was all gone.  My daughter loves hash browns... these were perfect.  Crispy but not burned on the outside, moist inside.  The brisket was wonderful... perfect...the smoke taste just barely there. Then we topped it off with the salted caramel chocolate torte.  It was wonderful, albeit one of the only deserts that did not have pumpkin or apple in it (seriously, not everyone wants pumpkin or apples in October). I didn't get the car washed as it will just be re-caked with bugs on the way back to San Diego... The gift store was fun, bathrooms spotless, and overall just a great place to visit in Scottsdale.  I think we are returning for an early dinner today. Great place."}
{"text":"More of a local institution than a restaurant.  The BBQ is great.  Love the setup, definitely unique."}
{"text":"Outstanding find in the middle of nowhere. The brisket and brisket tacos are outstanding. My favorite was the chili out of everything... you can even get your car washed!!!"}
{"text":"I find myself going here a lot, and for good reason. 

Car Wash 
 I used to think that getting a car wash in the metro Phoenix area required up selling and buying detailing services or getting your wind shield repaired, etc. At Tom's they just ask you what service you want. What a novel concept, no commissioned sales people.  They have comfortable sitting areas both inside and outside. The dudes drying and spiffing up the car are diligent and do a great job. 

Gas
What else can be said. The gas is about 10 cents cheaper than the surrounding gas stations.

Store
This place has everything that a convenience store would have and more (sorry if that sounded like a TV Pitchman). They have a lot of gourmet type items, dog food, magazines, beer, ice cream, chips, car accessories, etc. You get the idea, something for everyone. The restrooms are always clean.

Bistro
You're not going to believe this, but they have a bistro that always seems to be packed during the lunch and dinner hours. I have had their BBQ, and I definitely can say it's the best in Scottsdale. They have a pretty diverse menu such as tacos, soup, bbq pork sandwich, cubano sandwich, breakfast stuff, etc.

Summary
Don't take my word for it. Try this place out for yourself and you'll realize that I have just scratched the surface with this review of all that Tom's Thumb has to offer."}
{"text":"This place is a BBQ Bistro, Gift Shop, Wine Store, Bake Shop, Gas Station, Car Wash and MORE located very close to West World.

We didn't try out the car wash yet but stopped in to try some BBQ.

An Enthusiastic Cashier took our order, handed us a number, and we sat ourselves in the interesting Gift Shop surrounded by all kinds of trinkets, antiques and other goods.

Almost as soon as I sit down our platters got ran to us.

I received my half Brisket Sandwich with my half Bistro Salad. The first thing I sample is a piece of the Brisket. It was delicious in flavor but was barely warm and very dry. I break off a piece for my husband to try and he said wow is that dry. I never had brisket this  dry before. My salad was fresh but the blue cheese dressing was very thin without chunks of cheese in it. I do note cheese was on the salad.

By the reviews I'm certain they are usually better.

 Unless most people like dry Brisket?"}
{"text":"Came here for the car wash and ended up having one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I've had in Arizona. This place really is one of the \"Yelpiest\" businesses in the Scottsdale area due to its unusual combination of offerings.

It's a massive convenience market in a sense, everything from a gas station/car wash to a BBQ bistro and convenience store inside. 

The sandwich was nothing short of delicious, and I tried 3 of their home made sauces which were all very good.  All of the staff were great, especially since I was a first timer and Tom's can be a bit overwhelming when you first arrive. I'm 100% sold on this place now, and I'll definitely be returning to try the brisket - and maybe a car wash too."}
{"text":"After leaving the home show, we discovered we had a flat tire. We pulled into this establishment and to our dismay, we discovered that we were going to have problems getting our tire off to change it. A sweetheart of a guy loaned us his jack and it still didn't want to come off. As Michael Lawson was leaving to go home, he saw our struggle and went out of his way to assist us. He not only tried to help change the tire but brought us some water to drink while we were waiting. THIS is one place I will be coming to again!"}
{"text":"It was New Years Day, and bf and I were driving back from Flagstaff craving BBQ. We managed to miss the exit off the I-17 to go to one of the bbq joints up in Anthem, and when we tried to go to another nearby bbq place (Pork on a Fork) they were closed. Finally, we found one more option that wasn't too out of the way, Campfire Bistro! It's close to the Ice Den where I spent many a Friday night in middle school, so it brought back fond memories of singing to Smash Mouth and Backstreet Boys while ice skating with friends. 

When I realized this place was in a gas station, I was skeptical but hopeful. When I walked in I was surprised to see what basically looks and feels like La Grande Orange-it's in a market with upscale cool things to buy like wines, cheeses, meats, and fun tchatchkies to look at and play with. There's a register counter near the front when you walk in, and Campfire is on the righthand side of the shop further down from the entrance. It's easy to find once you're in.

They have a seating area near the soda fountains (COKE PRODUCTS, SCORE! they even have cherry coke from the fountain!), and there is a wonderful display of BBQ sauces with pretty dead-on descriptions of the flavor profiles of each. There's to-go ramekins for you to squeeze the bbq sauces into, and of course bf and I took at LEAST one of each. They let us borrow a sharpie to label the sauces so we would remember which was which, that was way helpful!

I was immediately attracted to the BBQ tacos-they came with a choice of pulled chicken, pulled pork, and brisket, and they come in an order of 3 and are served on flour tortillas (YES!). When I saw that there were 3 meat options and you get 3 tacos in the order, of course I asked if I could get one of each taco, which the cashier happily obliged. Bf ordered the same thing, plus a pulled chicken sandwich to have for later which came with chips. Tacos didn't come with a drink or chips, but they were under $10 for three of them, and they were all very tasty! Tender, juicy meat on a soft, fresh tortilla with salsa and some other goodies sprinkled on top.

Bf agreed that all of them were delicious, and I think we both decided the chicken is the winner here. All of the bbq sauces were good, though the spicy ones were VERY spicy! 

Cheap, delicious, creative...I will be back!


P.S. I noticed after I ordered that on the menu board, in VERY small print, that they offer BACON WAFFLES. Um, why is this not the main attraction?! Why not put it in bold letters and let the world know you offer this?! I definitely need to try these!!!"}
{"text":"I am a regular customer who comes in DAILY and supports the gas station, the car wash, and the restaurant. I'm appalled at the lack of concern and assistance  by the manager who watched me wait for 45 minutes for my breakfast and did NOTHING. I'm not one to make a scene so I waited until I left to call him and discuss his lack of customer focus. He never called me back.  That interaction speaks volumes to me. You've been warned."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's a gas station, a car wash, and a restaurant with a bakery. That's pretty awesome. They have different kinds of barbecue sauce. They're pretty yummy. My favorite it the hickory and the chipotle tasting one. The hot one is pretty dang spicy. And I can handle spice really well. The beef brisket sandwich is the bomb. Smells good. And definitely great service. I hope to go back again soon. :)"}
{"text":"On vacation and had to check out The Thumb since it was on DDD. Guy Feiri approved and I see why! Everything here is absolutely delicious. I highly recommend the baked Mac and cheese (one of the best I've had) and the homemade strawberry pop tart. SO. GOOD. Staff is also very friendly and helpful when ordering. We came two days in a row and I'm sure we will be back again before we leave!"}
{"text":"First I wanna say the food was absolutely amazing.  I had the Brisket Stack and that brisket melted in my mouth.  I had my food delivered so I can only imagine it would taste even better had I eaten there.  My only complaint is that the portion seemed a bit small and I don't really feel full.  But again in their defense, I did order it without the egg so maybe with that it would have been fine.  Either way, I plan on eating there again, next time I need to actually make my way there so I can dine-in."}
{"text":"One visit, one extremely satisfied couple who will be back for more.   My wife and I stopped by Tom Thumb's Fresh Market after reading some reviews and seeing it mentioned in a magazine.   Going in I was cautiously optimistic.   Coming out I was extremely happy to have found some of the best BBQ I have ever had!    Fantastic pulled pork with some of the best sauces around.   That sandwich on top of an unbelievable Mexican corn on the cob was so beyond delicious.   Throw on top of this a great store with all kinds of cool stuff to browse and delicious fresh baked goods! Hands down a must to try for everyone.   Going back today to check out their breakfast options which looked divine too!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on triple Ds website while traveling.  Pulled up to a Car Wash and Gas Station and thought I had the address wrong. Nope this is it. Best brisket I ever had. Everything was outstanding."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Loved everything about it. 

We had the pulled pork sandwich and BBQ beef brisket tacos, both of which were great, but it was the baked mac & cheese that stole the show! It was the best we've ever had. Don't miss their mexicorn, it's awesome too. And the slaw was perfect. 

Fun ambience and good tunes. Kudos to the owner!

We'll definitely be back next time we're in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Might give it 5 stars when I try more dishes. Unique, cool atmosphere. Friendly staff. Good food! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'll give it a 4-star now, manager reached out to me and we've been back several times without letting him know, and we've had a good experience overall each time. Not happy that the crab cake salad is not there anymore, permanently. Brisket platter is almost always great. Maybe just not consistent with cut but flavor is good. We miss the seating in the back, now it's full of merch."}
{"text":"We came here to get salad for dinner.  Really cool shop inside the gas station. Lots of fun things to buy. The restaurant itself is very casual. They offer seating inside or outside. Outside had nice lights strung from above. 

We got a chicken salad with cranberries, cheese, and nuts. It was big and tasted great!! 

My only complaint is that I didn't feel like we got much for our money. Paying $14 or more for a salad is a lot for just a salad and not much ambiance. I'd rather go eat at a restaurant that's an actual nice restaurant with a romantic setting for that price. I expected their prices to be cheaper since it's a casual place connected to a gas station. 

Food was great though. Don't get me wrong. Just nothing special."}
{"text":"I have been told many times, when I am near Scottsdale that I had to the \"The Thumb\"

Well, yesterday I was about a half hour away, and hadn't had lunch, so I shot over to give it a try.  I was blown away!  It is a restaurant, gas station, car wash, convenience store, general merchandise store, and more I am sure I am missing.  

I dropped my car off for a wash, and went inside to order some lunch.  As mentioned earlier, there is a lot more to this place then I could have ever imagined.  I ordered \"The Cuban\" came out quickly, and was amazing!  It can be ordered with fries or chips.  I went fries.  I couldn't finish my meal, as it was so filling and the portions were very generous.

Mike, the Manager that runs this place was very personable, and has a great staff around him.  

As I left, I collected my car, and their car wash is far superior to the ones I use use all the time in Tucson.

So, if you are ever anywhere near \"The Thumb\" make sure to stop by, fill up your tank, get a carwash, enjoy a meal, and spend a lot of time browsing their merchandise!"}
{"text":"Great bbq, wasn't led astray by Guy Fieri on this one. REAL smoked bbq, brisket was phenomenal with a half inch of bark. Super tender. Very friendly staff helped out even though hadn't been here before and very busy line. Great food, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to dine! You will, for sure, think you have the wrong place, when you drive up to a gas station! Turns out there is also a car wash at the back. But in that fabulous space in between, there is an awesome diner with delicious breakfast and lunch/dinner items, including great BBQ choices. You'll find counter dining, table dining, a huge aquarium to sit near...and a cute, quirky and LARGE gift shop area to browse through after stuffing yourself! Have been twice now, and it is an experience to share with the unsuspecting friend and loved one! Just pull off the freeway and tell them you need to get gas!"}
{"text":"Two pounds of brisket-to-go with three sides - the bill was around $60 plus bucks.
We agreed, never again - the food just isn't that good.

Fast forward six months when we get the brainstorm to only get their sides, we would bbq our own steaks and have a fast, inexpensive dinner, or so we thought.

Three sides; each a pint, the bill came to almost $30 bucks.
If you look at their menu, the sides are displayed for $2.00 each. This threw me off.
I'm guessing 2 dollars gets you a micro-side, not a real side.

Think this through for a second; a pint of beans was almost 10 bucks and they weren't even that tasty. I believe you can get four cans of S&W Chili beans (tasty) for about the same price, and with half the liquid smoke and salt content.

Collards had chunks of unrecognizable meat and were too salty to eat, not without having your own personal desalination facility with which to run them through first.

I'm not sure how the sides prices jump from $2 to $9 plus, but I'll never have to deal with it again. As I said, the food just isn't that good and the sides were way too salty.

TT; if you're going to charge Franklin's (Austin) prices, then serve up Franklin's type food.

On the bright side, it's a good place to sit and drink a beer while they wash your vehicle."}
{"text":"We thought it was a odd place to eat because it's a gas station, but as soon as you walk in the wood smoked/bbq'd aroma pulls you right in. Great food, possibly the best BBQ pulled pork I've had, but probably more of a $7 meal, not $9. They had multiple varieties of sauce to try on our pulled pork sandwiches, all of which were phenomenal, hickory being the best. I wouldn't get their green tea, it was definitely not tastey, and I wouldn't get one of the location's car washes, way too pricey guys! I Would return however!  I only wish they secluded the dining area a little more from the gas station section, but not bad... Not bad!"}
{"text":"It's BBQ meets Pygmalion!  They've taken the venerable Southern country store concept, think Rudy's in Austin, and dressed it up a notch or two.  I got the tacos so that I sample three meats.  I wound up discarding the tortillas so I could focus on the flavor.  All three had a great smoky char that was moist and tender without being too fatty or gristlly.  I haven't fully penetrated the sauce bar but I'm pretty sure that I will explore its depths on future visits."}
{"text":"This is by far in the way the worst barbecue in Scottsdale, asked for a wet piece of brisket sandwich and got nothing at all but fat unfortunately it was grotesquely undercut which made it chewy and no flavor. I am from Texas and I know barbecue and this is the worst. Do yourself a favor and drive up the streets of Scottsdale to Bryan's. The sad fact is I have had good barbecue here unfortunately inconsistency is the deathknell of most barbecue places. Fortunately for them there is very little competition that is not 20 minutes away."}
{"text":"Average at best. Went last evening and ordered two meals. I had the half rack ribs with collard greens and Mexican corn. Portion of 4 ribs was microscopic, corn was exceedingly charred, collard greens tasty, but not overly flavorful. My wife had the 2 meat platter of pulled pork and brisket. The pork was wet, not moist and the brisket was dry. Don't think we will be returning any time quickly. There is indeed better bbq to be found in the greater Phoenix area."}
{"text":"The first time I went to the thumb, was actually to just get gas. My friend ordered sliders and tried to talk me into getting something, I would not because I didn't buy food from a gas station. 
   She talked me into it, eventually and I've gone ever since. The ribs, brisket sandwich, blackened catfish, sausage sandwich are a few of the items I have tried all incredible. I would have had tried more of the menu but, the blackened catfish  is so good I've gotten it at least a half dozen. All of the food cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Met the owner Mike today who heard me out on their specials and prices. He was kind enough to sit down with us during lunch and even provided us with some b.o.g.o free sandwich coupons. Also, some car wash coupons. Thanks for making our day Mike!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the 30+ mile drive! 

Saw this place on DDD, and finally made it here!

The Pulled Pork Sandwich was great! 

The staff was friendly, chairs, tables, and bathroom were clean!

Will definitely be a repeat customer and will be a must on bringing any family and friends from out of town to enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"Upon walking in I was excited since I've heard so much about this place. Took a 45 minute drive just to try it out. Upon getting the register to order I felt like I was bothering them by ordering my food. The guy at the front clearly didn't want to be there. After spending almost $50 for two meals, I was disappointed with what we got. Ordered a platter with pork and brisket with Mac and cheese and potato salad. The pulled pork was amazing and the sauces were a nice compliment. The brisket was very dry and the coleslaw had little to no flavor. The Mac and cheese was good at the top, but after that it lacked flavor. The cornbread was ok but was very dry. The other meal we ordered also had dry and touch brisket and the Mexicorn was burnt and tasted of char. Not sure if I'll be back again."}
{"text":"I don't get all the hype about the food? I came for a car wash and some breakfast. I had the breakfast burrito and it was less than impressive. The coffee tasted like mud, no matter the amount of sugar and cream I loaded into my cup and I wound up tossing it after 2 sips. The staff wasn't exactly friendly either. At 8am on a Saturday, the place wasn't exactly busy yet everyone did their  best to avoid eye contact or offer assistance of any kind.

The car wash was great though. Make sure to check in on Yelp and get $5 off."}
{"text":"This gas station/cafe/shop/car wash seems just ok, with prices that are a little steep for the atmosphere and service.  

I had been wanting to come here for ages, and I left a little disappointed.  We stopped in for a brief, fun meet-up with friends at this gas station/cafe/store.  

I had a chocolate chip banana muffin, which was overly dry/crumbly and not very tasty.  I also ordered a hot chocolate (which wasn't impressive, either).  Our group mostly seemed to enjoy their breakfasts, but the prices seemed pretty steep for the atmosphere (and quality, judging from our order).

The servers seemed indifferent and not overly competent.

The place is kind of cute, I guess, but I think their attempt to cross LGO with a Danny's car wash falls short of comfortable or cool.  For example, we came on a winter day and every time someone opened the front door, the entire dining room was cold.  And it still has a strong gas station vibe.

Perhaps if I'd ordered a meat dish, it might have been a better experience."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ!   Wait is pretty long at lunch, but other times it quick!    Inside a gas station of all places.   I recommend the brisket sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how big the niche is for gourmet southern food while waiting for your car to be detailed, but apparently there is a large enough demographic to develop in one in North Scottsdale.  

The best way to describe it would be to imagine a QT where every aspect of the traditional gas station/convenience store concept was redesigned by the shopkeepers at \"La Grande Orange.\"   

While I didn't have my car shined, I can attest that the southern-ish cafe inside serves up some of the tastiest southern food I've had in the Valley.  They absolutely nail their pulled pork, grits, bacon, eggs, etc - and good lord their Carolina BBQ sauce would fit right at home in Gastonia.  I'll be back with friends - and maybe a dirty car."}
{"text":"Great food but had to wait awhile for our food.  The line was very one so understandably the kitchen was backed up"}
{"text":"I don't know what some of these people are talking about.  The gas prices and car washes are in line with the rest of N. Scottsdale and the food from the cafe is excellent.  I have tried the pulled pork, brisket and pulled chicken and the sauces they have available to compliment make the BBQ complete.  Salads are huge.  Craft beer selection is excellent.  A little pricey on some items, but seems about right for the convenience.  Oh, and the old school full-service at the pump, who else does that anymore?  Check your tire pressure, clean your windshield, worth a few extra bucks from time to time."}
{"text":"One stop shop!  Everyone in the family likes coming here.  Love the atmosphere, service, food, and the cute items for sale.  Even if we don't need a carwash or gas, we still come in for a latte and chai."}
{"text":"Hate to be the Debbie Downer here, but it just wasn't great.

We both ordered pulled pork plates.  The pork was on the dry side and cold.  Not refrigerator cold, but room temperature cold.  We were there for dinner, so maybe it had been smoked quite a bit earlier in the day.  Regardless, it was not great.  The Texas toast was really just thick sliced bread.  But the plus side of dry, cold pork was that the bread didn't get soggy in the box.  I had beans which were still a hair underdone.  I also tried the slaw which I  didn't like at all.  I expected mayo based or at least vinegar based, but it tasted like it was dressed with nothing but oil.  Why my husband opted for the Kraft mac 'n cheese rather than trying their baked version, I'll never know.  But even that is much better when you make it at home. 

On the plus side...excellent potato salad.  Mayo dressing with just a hint of mustard, not like the overly sweet crap you get at the deli.  Smore dessert was yummy.  Staff was awesome.  All very polite, and they pack to go orders in front of you, so no surprises when you get home.

Based on all the other positive reviews, I would like to try going again sometime. Maybe lunch would be better.  And maybe I can get my car washed, too.  God knows it needs it."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's quirky, but consistently good BBQ. And, they do gluten free, which is awesome."}
{"text":"Wowzers! It doesn't get much better than The Thumb BBQ. Pig & Grits was sooooooooo good and the epicness of the cheesy pull on the Mac-n-Cheese was ridiculous! We didn't get a chance to try the car wash, but if they wash cars as good as they cook food then I'm sure it's great! Add in the super quirky gift shop to peruse and this is must stop place in the Valley for both locals and visitors alike."}
{"text":"I love following the advice of my fellow YELPER's. Tried this place after a brutal workout ..Amazing! Who would of thought good bbq at a gas station?! I m a big dessert lover but did not try any there, the cupcakes looked dangerous (in a good way)."}
{"text":"2 stars for mediocre BBQ, and the overabundance of private school kids in there after school gets out. This establishment REALLY needs to put a cap on the amount of kids in there after school because they take up nearly every table, and are loud. I don't really want to be around 100 blabbing teenaged kids on their cellphones, while trying to enjoy a subpar BBQ meal. Ill drive out of my way to Honey Bears, Rudy's, or Bobby Q's from now on."}
{"text":"Hands down this is the best BBQ joint in the state. They have always been consistent with their quality and service. The brisket tacos are out of this world along with all of the classics they serve. Definitely DDD approved!!"}
{"text":"I just love this place... It's something different and fun... Great space and fun atmosphere... It's like a 21st century general store style market and eatery!!!!! Great gifts, wine, baked goods and BBQ... What else could you ask for. This is my first review and I have been an avid yelper for months now... That's how great this place is!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful quality. Being a big BBQ fan I am picky with where I eat. This place surpasses them. Excellent brisket. Wonderful sides. Plethora of sauces. Chill atmosphere. Such a good find!"}
{"text":"This is such a funky and fun gas station, yes I said gas station! This is a gas station, meets a high end car wash, meets a general store with local finds, meets a bakery with homemade treats, meets a delicious BBQ restaurant with award winning BBQ...all in one stop! 

I've visited several times and enjoyed their BBQ, bakery, car wash and shopping at their general store. The BBQ is really good and has a variety of homemade BBQ sauce to choose from. I enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich which was tender and delicious with every bite. It's a smaller sandwich so if you have a huge appetite, you might want to get something on the side to share. But, it's an amazing sandwich. I especially like their BBQ sauce! 

The general store is stocked with gifts, knick knacks and more. It's really fun to browse through the aisles while you wait for your food or for your car wash to be complete. The bakery has an in-house pastry chef who whips up sweet treats on a daily basis!

This is definitely a fun gas station to visit, especially if you are in need of gas or a car wash and want to distract your kids (or yourself!) while you wait!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Arrived about 30 minutes before close with a million kids and the staff handled it like champs!! Thank you for the great food and good service"}
{"text":"I like this place. It's close to the Ice Den and after a game of hockey I like to come here for a barbecue sandwich. While it looks like only a gas station, inside you will find a counter to order a sandwich and tables to sit at, both inside and out. The brisket is tender and they have a number of different barbecue sauces to meet all tastes."}
{"text":"Decided to try something everyone wasn't raving about since everyone was saying their food was so good. Apparently no one tried the Mac and cheese. It was bland and could probably feed about 3 people. Way too huge for lunch. There were bread crumbs on top that could've been omitted and I think it could've used some salt. Will probably not be coming here again.  Plus who likes eating in a corner store/ car wash with limited seating."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, fairly priced. Try their seven BBQ sauces!
We had the brisket and the BBQ chicken, both of which were juicy and flavorful even without the amazing BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"I'll admit to being a bit caught up in the hype. Everyone has heard of \"the BBQ place inside of the gas station\" and I was excited to experience it for myself. The staff was very kind and the place has an interesting vibe, but my pulled pork sandwich was on the dry side. It's a little overpriced and I can't say it lived up to my expectations. At least I can say I've been there."}
{"text":"Awesome place... a bit on the expensive side but all the food is very good and so are the sweets."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here and were pleased with the food but not the service! After ordering our food we waited a long time to be served. When the food arrived we did not get what we ordered. The waitress either forgot to write it down or wasn't paying attention to our request. We asked for no lettuce and add cheese to our breakfast BLT and neither requests were done. She seemed frustrated and agitated when we asked her politely to take it back to correct the mistake. We noticed several other tables had the same problem with her. She delivered food to the table next to us and after placing down on the table in front of the customers she had to pick it back up and deliver it to another table. It didn't seem right. Also she apologized to them saying \" I'm a little upset and confused because someone at another table was mean to me.\". We heard her loud and clear. Finally after our food arrived we ate and were satisfied with the taste of the food. It took way to long to get served and she was really not to suited to be a good waitress. I don't think the food was that good to return for service that bad."}
{"text":"This is about the fourth time I have been to this place and every single time it's the worst service. When you try to do too many things you're never good at all of them. Bad customer service. I won't be going back"}
{"text":"Great bbq, cool experience.  Took some persuading to convince my wife that dinner at a gas station was a good idea, but now we've been back a few times.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Add this place to the top of Elite events!!! This is the place to come for a car wash and the best BBQ I have ever had! Try the beans, they are out of this world!!! Wish we didn't live so far I would be weekly!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner without a car wash. Full rack of ribs slathered in sauce with two sides (I chose coleslaw and fries). The meat was moist and came easily off the bone. It was certainly not the best ribs I've ever had, but solid nonetheless. The sides were average.

It's an interesting little eating space on the inside. Certainly not charming, but not without its own eclectic character.

Our servers were attentive and nice, although I felt a bit rushed by them at the end of the meal.

We did a quick walkthrough after the meal and scanned high end gas station fare with plenty of kitschiness and some Restoration Hardware furniture for lounging. Not your average place whether you are getting gas, a car wash, leopard print steering wheel covers, a beverage to go, a brisket, etc., etc."}
{"text":"Came here for a second time after coming last year.  The portions on the brisket sandwich were a lot smaller this year. My daughter order a half brisket sandwich and salad, it was more like a quarter sandwich.  Although the brisket is delicious, the sandwiches are not cheap and only come with a tiny bit of coleslaw and a bag of chips."}
{"text":"This place was awesome - get past the fact that it is a \"Gas Station\" (I say that a little tongue in cheek because to call this place a gas station is like calling Disneyland a Carnival) because once you go inside, it has a great dining area.  I had the Brisket which was awesome and I dipped it in each homemade BBQ sauce available - the North Carolina brought me right back to my South Carolina roots with an awesome vinegar-based sauce.  The fries were perfect and my buddy also enjoyed his burger topped with pulled pork topped with fried jalapeños - he was apparently the first one to try it and it was a hit.  Go - i will probably be there tomorrow, and the next day and..."}
{"text":"Came here for a car wash and was pleasantly surprised at everything they have to offer inside.  When I first pulled up, the guy was polite and guided me through the process of selecting what j wanted to get.  It was his first day but he called over a guy to help answer a few questions, no biggie.  He was professional. I went inside the store front and got some bbq while I waited. The food was ok but was overpriced for what you got. There were a lot of cool nick knacks in the shop ranging from cards, to signs, to glassware, to books to clothing.  It seemed a little overwhelmed up front where the main cashier is also the one making the coffee drinks. The back seating area where I waited for my car was nice. I watched my car go through the tunnel on a video screen.  Overall, a cool vibe to the whole place.  Unlike any other car wash or gas station I've ever been to. I was also definitely pleased with the quality of the car wash I got."}
{"text":"Such a great concept!
A gas station, a car wash, a restaurant, and a lil shop!

We had the smoked pull pork sandwich and the chicken salad sandwich.
The pull pork sandwich was pretty good. Lots of meat and you get to choose the kind of bbq sauce you want to use from their variety of sauces.
The chicken salad sandwich was okay too.  But I would prefer the pulled pork sandwich over the chicken salad.

This place is kind of far for me, but hey, if im ever in the area, hungry, and needing a car wash, I'd definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious but service is always lacking. Your best bet is get it to go or cater your event."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place since we moved out here a year ago, I finally decided to check it out. Was disappointed. Got the 2 meat platter, both meats were on the cold side. Beans were really good and mac and cheese was decent. I will give it one more shot."}
{"text":"When traveling we often are on the hunt for a Triple D restaurant. Found Tom's Thumb Fresh Market. If you're in the neighbor, need gas, car washed & something to eat we've found the perfect spot. Definitely worth it. Great BBQ with fun & tasty sides. A peach cobbler is a great way to finish off a great meal served by a friendly & helpful staff. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did!"}
{"text":"Great car wash, fabulous service. Amazing restaurant inside with the best bbq and the selection of retail gift items is awesome.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I am from NY and traveled to the Valley area twice in 2015.However, I blame Tom's Thumb for getting me into REAL barbecue, which in turned caused me to buy a smoker, hundreds of dollars worth of meat, and then gain an extra 10 pounds within months. 

I went here twice as the ribs were superb, both times around. It's just that damn good."}
{"text":"Don't give them the 5 stars cause took them 23 MINUTES to get my food. Other than that? Loved it!
Ordered (as suggested by Guy Fieri): 
the crab cake salad ... Super fresh and delicious
Three piggies in a blanket (one pulled pork, one chicken and one brisket) ... Liked the three, I added hickory BBQ sauce too!
Side of mac and cheese... Creamy and al dente'
Definitely coming back my next trip to AZ!!"}
{"text":"Normally you'd think going to a gas station/car wash wouldn't be the most desirable place to grab lunch, but those who think that, obviously have not been to Tom's Thumb!

I work in the area and make a point to go in every few weeks or so. They have a wide variety of things to order for breakfast and lunch. Staff is always friendly and accommodating. During lunch there can be quite a wait for pick up as this place is so busy, but it's definitely worth it. Plan accordingly. 

Their Mac and Cheese is to die for! It's my go to cheat meal and worth every single cheesy bite and guilt!

If you're a BBQ fan, they have awesome sandwiches and a variety of barbecue sauces to choose from. As for the facility itself, it's very clean and more upscale. They have many bottles of wine, beer, snack and cute decor and knick-knacks that would make for a nice gift.

A one stop shop! Eat, grab a gift, get your car vacuumed, boom!"}
{"text":"This was a nice little gas station restaurant! Was excited to try it after hearing it was on Diners Drive -ins and dives. I am a vegetarian, but my friend loves good barbecue, so we got take out from Tom's Thumb this week. Even though we have totally different taste in food, we were both pleased!
First we tried to order online, but it did not work. We tried on our phones and a laptop and ended up having to call. I ordered a caprese sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries, and my friend got a platter.
The food was ready right when I got there, which was nice. I also liked the interior of the restaurant, reminded me a bit of the General Store. The outdoor eating area was nice as well.
Everything on my sandwich tasted really fresh, the pesto on there was excellent! I think I would have preferred it as a panini, but I still enjoyed it. Sweet potato fries were incredible as well. I liked how they had an array of different bbq sauces to choose from, got a few different ones for my friend to have with his platter and he liked them! He said he really liked all of his meal, except the pork and beans. Overall I was impressed with Toms Thumb, would like to return for the portobello sandwich!"}
{"text":"We had friends take us here for lunch. They live across the street so we walked. At first all I could see was a car wash. Granted, all the cars were high end BMWs, Caddies and Lexus but still. We went inside and had a short wait in line to order at the counter. Mike, the general manager (found out later) took our orders. I mentioned we were guests of friends who were Regulars and that we were celebrating a birthday. Mike arranged and delivered a complementary peach cobbler with 2 large servings of ice cream and we all sang happy Birthday. The food was excellent. I had beef brisket sandwich. Moist style which included fat. I enjoyed it but probably not for people who like lean style. Great service and Mike visited with us after our meal. Definitely be back even though we only drive a Hyundai!"}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy BBQ! Ate it at a wedding reception. Tried the pulled pork, chicken and brisket with 3 BBQ sauces (Kansas City, Hickory & Habanero), rolls, cole slaw, salad, and cowboy beans. All were scrumptious! Caterers, were a little late, but called to say they were a bit delayed. Very professional and pleasant. Would definitely have them again."}
{"text":"Extremely rude and off putting staff in a weird gas station/restaurant/car wash... Thing that can't seem to make up its mind on what it wants to be."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Such a random combinations (at least for me!) car wash, gas station and BBQ spot. I've never actually gotten a car wash here, but it's on my list. Lately I've been coming here during my lunch break. It's a little of a drive, but it's with it. They are fast and friendly. 

I've tried several dishes, but the Brisket Sandwich is my favorite. It's so good that I crave it! The meat is cook to perfection and the bread is just toasted enough. Must try!!"}
{"text":"This was a great find! Where else can you stop in for a tasty lunch, and turn over your keys to get your car wash and gas tank filled up?? Nice service inside...you must try the 3 pigs as well as the Cuban sandwich, it was really authentic Cubano style the way I like it. Bill, the manager was very helpful. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a gas station, car wash, knick knack store and BBQ joint all rolled into one. They have been featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and recently remodeled. 
In the local area there is a lot of hype about this place so I decided to check it out since it had been a while (read a couple of years) that I had been to this place. 
Let me start with the food. The brisket is top notch. The ribs are not bad. Other stuff, comme ci, comme ca!
My experience last evening was a mixed bag.
We arrived at 6 pm and they were already sold out of the ribs and sliced brisket. We ordered a pound and a half of the chopped brisket and we were not disappointed. 
What we were very disappointed in was the service. It was like watching the grass grow. Not only was it slow (like molasses) but it was sort of un-engaging. Perhaps a sign of complacency as they are quite popular. 
Additionally, to be out of sliced brisket, ribs and Mac n Cheese at 6 pm is akin to a grocery store running out of milk and eggs. 
For the food, 4 Stars. For menu management ZERO stars. For service 2 Stars. 
There you have it."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but the service was non-existent.  It took several minutes for anyone to greet us after being seated.  The waiter didn't seem too knowledgeable or friendly, and it took waaaayy too long to get our food.

The food runner had no clue where the food was supposed to go (for everyone in the restaurant).  It became comical.

And to get the check?  At least fifteen minutes after we had asked."}
{"text":"Not only is their car wash the best in Scottsdale, their BBQ is top notch as well. Bring your car in for a wash and eat lunch while it gets pampered. This is a North Scottsdale gem for sure!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Aerosmith - Janie's Got A Gun)

Yum, Yum, Yum, Tommy what have you done?
Yum, Yum, Yum, it's the Stack I want
Yum, Yum, Yum, Tommy what have you done?
Yum, Yum, Yum, It's for Yelp....

Tommy's got a thumb
Tommy's got a thumb
The Yelp world's gonna come
Yelping from the valley of the sun
Spice meat rubbing too!
Cinnamon bun rolling through!
They said when Bo Bites was a coming they asked him write a song with some fun!
But man, a car wash a comin'
Now that Tom's Thumb gotta Stack, I'm never gonna eat the same.....!

I've always came here for a Yelp event, but finally got my chance for lunch one fine day!  Who'd ever guess there would be good food at a car wash....yeah a car wash! 

I had to order the Tom's Thumb Stack; made to order only!  Definitely a recommend from this happy patron!  The stack comes with a bed of crispy hash browns, topped with a beef brisket, over easy egg, and drizzled with a chipotle mayo aioli.  I love the crunch of the hash browns while the smokiness of the brisket provides a welcoming aroma!  Also, what doesn't go well with an over easy egg a topped!?  I usually add the habanero bbq sauce to give this awesome dish and extra kick to finish my meal!  

In the end, Tom's Thumb is a must visit, whether for a car wash, good eats, or just checking out it's knicks and knacks they have displayed.  They also have a fine bakery, which they make fresh cinnamon rolls every morning!  I guess you can say it's like an all in one stop shop for your belly! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Giving them a 2-star rating is generous. It was great a few years ago. Ate there for breakfast this morning and it was underwhelming to say the least. Hashbrowns were burnt, bacon was soggy and the fruit must have been sitting in a container for a few days. I had to spit it out.  I hope they turn it around."}
{"text":"I had no idea you could get awesome barbecue and tasty bakery items at a gas station/car wash joint in Scottsdale Arizona. Now I know why this place was featured on Diners, Drive-in & Dives."}
{"text":"I feel badly giving this place only 3 stars because the food was really good.  We were there on a Saturday night and the service was unbelievably awful. There are 5 employees standing around not really sure of what they're doing. Needs some management to guide these people.  Anyways, I highly recommend the brisket tacos and pork tacos. My sons comment about the ribs was they were some of the best he's had. The sauces were great. Definitely worth going but maybe go for take out."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying if I had to choose my perfect meal BBQ would be last on my list, but if I had to choose a favorite lunch spot Tom's Thumb would be at the top.  

Usually when I go to places that have been on diners drive ins and dives I am disappointed but that is not the case here. I had the catfish on my first visit, which was great, but on my second trip I had the pigs and grits and that was phenomenal. I never thought I would like grits with pulled pork but when you get that creamy texture with the tangy-ness of the BBQ sauce, it's unlike anything I have ever tasted.  

There is always a long line when you go around lunch time so that's a bit of a bummer, but also means they are probably doing something right!! Definitely a great place to take visitors from out of town, or just for a casual local breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed. The gas is expensive, the food inside is expensive and not fresh. The employees are very friendly but that doesn't make up for it. 

I've stopped in a few times to pick up some veggies/ fruit as a snack at work and they have never been fresh or even ripe. I have been disappointed each time. 

 The first time I stopped in, I bought a container of sliced cucumber. Later at work I ate one and it was so sour and clearly had gone bad. I tried to call them to let them know to remove the product from the shelf and could not for the life of me find the phone number. It is not listed ANYWHERE. 

When I went in to return the product they were very appologetic and sincere but at this point I doubt I'll come in again.  Maybe they just need time to settle in, so I might come back in a few months."}
{"text":"When someone asked to meet us here for lunch, I thought \"We are eating at a gas station?Really?\" Yes we were. And it was good. The BBQ was good, the tacos better. Service was spot on, and it's a comfortable place to have lunch in the sun. We enjoyed our visit here a great deal."}
{"text":"Brisket sandwich with sweet potato fries hit the spot the other day when I came in for lunch.
I heard of this place about several years ago but never got around to stop by until the other day. Only other place I went for BBQ inside a gas station was in Kansas City, Kansas. (which wasn't the cleanest place), I was pleasantly surprised how clean and inviting this place was when I walked in. As expected, a long line to order but it wasn't too bad for the first timer as it gave me time to read through the entire menu.  

I couldn't decide either brisket sandwich or pigs and grits, so I ordered both. Just so you know, one order is enough to satisfy an appetite, and no I didn't eat both on my own, I eat a lot but not that much. I shared. 

Brisket sandwich, it wasn't the best I had but still very good that I would definitely come back to order more.  Substituting to sweet potato fries was the right choice.  I finished eating sweet potato french fries before my sandwich.

Pigs and grits... First bite, it was so fat but so tasty... I could get used to having this for breakfast (or lunch).  It really sat heavy in my stomach. I stayed full for a long time.

I saw several other customers called ahead for pick up order. They didn't wait in line, they just came in and paid to pick up their food.  Since this place is sort of on my way home from work, I thought I could do the same on my way home for dinner someday.

I don't know why I waited so long to try here. Perhaps I just had a bad experience from another BBQ place inside a gas station where I was stared by fellow customers as if I don't belong there.  This place is clean, bright, plenty of seating inside and outside, friendly staff, good food,....I sure will be back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely yummy.
I try to go at least once a month especially for the beef brisket. It is cooked perfect. One of the best french fries. The mexican corn is not authentic but is as close as You get."}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ joints joints in the Valley! Fill up on race fuel for your vehicle and brisket in your belly! Two huge Thumb's UP!"}
{"text":"My husband likes this place so well, he made it a \"destination\" for us this Sunday to have a breakfast he said \"even you will like\" and get our cars washed. He was right! I had sourdough waffles with bacon. They have great food; even a pastry chef is on staff. The service was outstanding. 
The kicker is I left my I-phone and they searched the store to find successfully it for me. 
We will definitely be back again. I can't wait to try more tasty dishes."}
{"text":"Love his place... they need a spot in PhX but whatever. People were super cool even when they were busy. The food is bomb.com, great for leftovers and big groups. I love the food and the options. Took my boss from KC and even his leg was shaking. Everything  has been awesome. 

Couple of frustrating things that took me a few visits to understand. The upgrade on fatty meat is weak and cheap of them to even ask. Cut the brisket and serve it... don't airline the fuck out of your customers. Cheap move ?... just saying. The menu needs work because they leave a lot out. For example, platters have no sausage listed and the paper menus doesn't have the same set up or items the overhead menu has. They need better to go options...bags/carriers and sauce packs. I'd even pay extra to not have 60 sauce things & a flimsy ass bag (only one size and the boxes don't even complement the bags so i don't get it) and no drink holders... which is weird cause they have a coffee bar, tea and a huge selection of drinks in general. That's just feedback for the owners. 

Never had a bad experience and the food is better than excellent."}
{"text":"Plenty of brisket and potato salad for two meals!"}
{"text":"This is only for the food:

Ordered the crispy fried pulled pork with bbq sauce over grits with shredded cheddar cheese and bacon. Nothing else is needed to be said. ::drops the mic::"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  I go to Tom's Thumb often for car washes as they always do an impeccable job!  My car is perfectly cleaned and I know that when I'm there, that its in good hands (can't unfortunately say the same for ANY other Scottsdale car wash!) The staff is always friendly, I never feel like they are trying to upsell me for anything I do not want/need and the atmosphere is clean and enjoyable!  The inside is adorable with the best BBQ pork in town-- (we go often for lunch!) and the deli area has the cutest cupcakes you have ever seen!  Planning to go back soon to snag one!  I also love the shop that is full of lots of knick-knacks and eclectic artwork, home décor, quaint gifts and more!  And, my kids just adore the wooden chess set.  The waiting area comes equipped with water (so you aren't dying in this 100++ degree summer heat!) and is chock full of local magazines and newspapers to peruse.   Definitely give this place a thumbs up!  Love Tom's Thumb and will be back very soon!  PS- my husband says this is the only place he trusts me to go and get my car washed ;) I recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Great brisket, great staff and friendly service. Huge selection and it's all good. Plenty of selection for the kids too."}
{"text":"We frequent Tom's Thumb, and enjoy the barbecue. The General manager truly cares about the each customer's experience."}
{"text":"One of the finest places to have Breakfast Linch or dinner. People are friendly and just can't say enough good things about this wonderful place. Everyone needs to find out for themselves. I travel all over and by far, the food and atmosphere here is among the finest I have seen anywhere in the US. I would give them 10 stars if I could"}
{"text":"Unbelievable place for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! You just have to go there...you'll see! Casual hangout for latte/pastries or go for a huge fresh breakfast better than any fancy place you've tried! Carry home lunch or dinner or eat there. Great fun cute gifts for friends - like shopping at Cracker Barrel  but better!!! ;)"}
{"text":"The concept of a car wash/boutique/restaurant was completely unique and unexpected as I arrived for a Yelp event. We dropped off my car, walked inside and were greeted with nice smells, smiling employees and tons of merchandise! We were able to sample a couple brews, wines, food and dessert during our duration, all while getting a free car wash! The food was tasty, I especially liked the brisket tacos and coleslaw. The desserts were also very good...I tried the oreo cupcake and a cookie. Employees were quick to take your empty plates away and refill your drinks almost instantaneously, 5 star service for sure! 

As we walked around the market, we noticed kitchy items, wines, car products, beverages galore, clothes, scarves...the list goes ON AND ON! Of course, everything was completely overpriced but that is to be expected in Scottsdale. The cute coasters I wanted were almost $40 for 4...yeah right! We didn't catch the demos and after wandering around the store, we walked out to get the car. The car wasn't there so we walked to the front to ask someone where it was then were told to walk to the back (again) to get the car, where were told it was parked in the front. That was confusing...good thing my car was left in a garage type area next to an incredible Lambo! Keys were left inside my car after the car wash, which made me a little uncomfortable because who knows who could have hopped a wall and drove off with my car. 

We ended up getting gas at another store (gas here is at least 20 cents more a gallon than most) and upon further inspection, noticed the car wash wasn't very good. I noticed lots of white spots on my black car and had to wipe down areas that the attendants should have...at least it was a free car wash. I don't live anywhere close to here so it was a nice surprise to come here and enjoy a different experience. I think this place would do really well out in a rural area or be a great stop on a long road trip for good food and merchandise.  Maybe an idea for expansion?

Thank you Tom's Thumb and Yelp for a overall good time."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place for lunch. Beef brisket is the best I have ever eaten including at southern barbecue restaurants. Pork is excellent. Soup is hearty and home made. It also has an excellent gift shop. Wine selection. Service is friendly and efficient"}
{"text":"OK, seriously, I have driven by what I thought was a gas station and car wash more times than I can remember. Then I am watching Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and Tom's Thumb is on.. the restaurant. You see this is a car wash, gas station, gift shop, bakery and restaurant all in one. We went today at 2Pm to avoid the crowds but it was still busy. You order your food, get a number to put on your table and wait. We were told 20 minute wait but it was only 10. WOW! I had the brisket platter, 3 large strips of brisket with 2 side dishes. I ordered fruit and coleslaw, good, made with vinegar, not mayo. My husband had Three Pigs...3 small sandwiches, he had pulled pork, chicken and brisket. He said it was delicious. I had ice tea with my meal, they have 4 kinds of fresh brewed tea. SOOOOO good, will be back. YUM. There is no server, they just deliver your food when ready, Good prices, good portions you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Thumb is my happy place. Love the vibe, the food and especially the unique 'wares' for sale. From unique home decor items to special toys and true AZ gifts and collectibles, I love browsing while the food is being cooked. Great baked goods (all made on site - watch the bakery team create through the special interior window), yummy coffee drinks and cold beer on tap - all topped off with an amazing array of bbq sauces for the delicious smoked meats, sandwiches, salads, burgers etc etc. If you haven't been- GO- and join Guy Fiery in raving about The Thumb!"}
{"text":"I'd have to say I'm disappointed in the quality of the brisket. I had the sliced brisket sandwich featured on \"DDD\" and paid for the upcharge for the fatty side.  It was very chewy and the fat hadn't rendered out. You couldn't even pull apart the meat. Ended up tossing the sandwich and eating my kids fries.  

The lean chopped brisket on the sliders was more tender.   For the premium prices they charge, my expectations were a bit higher."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome BBQ in N Scottsdale at a quaint, unassuming venue (it's inside a gas station). Beef Brisket and Pulled Pork are my 2 favorite dishes. I'm not a huge fan of their shredded chicken. Sweet potato fries and Mac N Cheese are their 2 best sides. Also, huge smorgasbord of BBQ sauces. I come here at least 2x per month."}
{"text":"What an amazing gas station. Most unusual, unique, clean, special gas station I've ever been in. Found it by accident while at the Arizona Bike Week. It is well worth a visit.I would pay more just to go there but no need because their prices are in line, their food is delicious the items that they have in the store for sale are unique and special and no I don't work for Tom Thumbs I just want to say it is an amazing place."}
{"text":"Wow.  Not worth the drive. We ordered our food only to be treated badly by the lady behind the counter. She appeared to be having a bad day or was just extremely rude. She was very snappy and not very nice. The food was horribly over priced and not very good. We ended up getting it to go to avoid dealing with cranky staff.  I saw the DDD show and thought it would be a  neat place to go. I went out of my way to take out of town family and I'm sorry I did."}
{"text":"This was completely unexpected.

If you are reading this review, please grab your car keys and head over here.  This place is a gem.  Yes it a gas station.  Its not like any other gas station.  It's a gas station that has full-service pumps, high octane racing fuel and a wonderful restaurant inside that has won \"Best of Phoenix\" awards.

Inside the \"gas station\" are two different seating areas.  There is also a patio.  Since the weather is still nice, we ate on the patio.  After you order they bring the food to you.

I did have a mistake made on my order and it was corrected very quickly.

How would I summarize this place?  It's really cool.  I wish it was closer to my house."}
{"text":"This was my third time coming here. The first time was nothing out of the ordinary. Second time was bad on all levels but since there was an event taking place, everyone might've been overwhelmed which is understandable.
The third time truly great. Service was fantastic, all servers, cashiers were smiling and handling everything in a timely fashion.
I met with Michael the GM and we chatted for a bit about the business and how the services are performed. He mentioned I order the \"Chopped Brisket\" since it wasn't on the menu. I'm glad he did cause it was the best brisket I've had in years. Strongly recommend everyone to order it with a side of sweet frys.

While eating Kara my gf had her car detailed.
When the detail was finished the car looked fantastic. She kept raving about how flawless her paint and interior was. I wanted to have my Bmw washed except I was too embarrassed since I traveled a lot that thus my car being dirty. Michael covered our meal plus wash which we are truly thankful for. 

We will be coming back in the upcoming week for breakfast."}
{"text":"I bookmarked Tom's Thumb on Yelp years ago, so it took awhile, but I finally made my way there to check it out first hand last week... 

I wanted the full experience, so I filled my car up with gas, left it with Ivan to get the signature wash, and headed inside to check out the general store and enjoy some breakfast.  I admired the bakery treats to my left as I entered, but I'd already had a cup of coffee that morning, so I kept on walking toward the restaurant counter... 

I ended up with a delicious 2 egg breakfast.  I asked for my eggs over medium and for my sides, I chose the creamy grits and sliced tomatoes.  For toast, I asked for a whole wheat tortilla.  I love that option.  I enjoyed it all!

I found the service to be friendly and the seating options comfortable.  While I didn't make any purchases from the store beyond my breakfast, I enjoyed looking around as they have a variety of gifts and convenience items.  It's an awesome one-stop shop!  Clean bathrooms to boot!

I left with a full belly, fueled up for the day and feeling great.  My car did too!

Tom's Thumb is a unique gem of a business that is absolutely worth a visit, even if you have to drive out of your way to check it out.  I'd be a regular if I lived closer, but I'll absolutely return... maybe even with the kids in tow next time!"}
{"text":"Great customer service perhaps the very best! On a very busy day the GM came to our table and answered a question on our $5 discount on car wash and gave me a $5 bill with a smile. Thanks we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Tom's was closed for a while while they renovated. it is back open and as good as ever.  The service is great.  You can tell that they are really trying to kick it up a notch, even though they were already very good.  The half Brisket Stack is enough for me, but I could eat ribs and brisket here until I exploded."}
{"text":"As I sit here munching on the so-called 'Chopped Salad' I'd ordered for lunch, I contemplate the kind of review I'll give this place. What will I say? Will I mention that they don't know the definition of a CHOPPED salad? The salad I was served was not a CHOPPED salad. Will I mention that when I said something about it to the server she mumbled something incoherently and promptly walked away, not giving a crap about my concerns? Should I mention the kitchen forgot two key ingredients in my $11 salad? Should I write that when I brought it back to the server she yelled back to the kitchen that my salad was made 'all wrong?' Maybe I should mention that the staff didn't know how to handle a dissatisfied customer? Should i put down that the 'manager,' a kid barely out of high school, who could not articulate who he was to me, scrawled on a business card for me to get a free 'chopped' salad on my next visit? No, I won't write any of that.... Here's what I WILL write... 

Tom's Thumb is an eatery that needs to get a clue. The food was bland (except for the BBQ sauce that I dumped on my salad. Good stuff!) and the help was clueless, evidenced by the lack of friendliness, helpfulness and complete absence of any customer service skills, whatsoever. The staff is poorly trained both on the the register and the kitchen. My all around experience at Tom's was very disappointing. 

So, if you want good food at a great price and friendly service... Go to In and Out Burger. 

I'll let you know if the free chopped salad tastes any better..."}
{"text":"Tom Thumb is my Favorite BBQ in town. The service is always fast and courteous and the remodel looks amazing, also not to forget the BBQ is the best I have had. All the sauces are amazing. 

I had the pleasure of speaking with Mark. The owners are very in touch with the clients, and value our feedback in continuing the customer experience they deliver so well, that has put Tom Thumb on the map.

I appreciated Marks words and will most definitely continue my twice a month visits. Tom Thumb will be my go to for BBQ as well as marketing for them by word of mouth in the future. Thank you Tom Thumb and staff!"}
{"text":"Run. Don't walk. I have never had a bad meal here, breakfast, lunch or dinner. The blueberry muffins are so good. The BBQ is delicious."}
{"text":"Save your money and avoid this place!  For $15.24, I ordered the two meat platter with the beef brisket and pulled pork, which was lacking a side dish and some of the beef brisket that was very dry. The pulled pork was delicious and the down low barbecue sauce was very good, but that's about all that was good about this meal. I got my order to go and gave them a call once I got home and realized that it was missing a good portion of the meal. Was extremely disappointed! The lady that I spoke with told me to come in at my convenience and she would give me a compt'd meat platter. When I went to collect, a very rude guy told me that he had no idea what I was talking about and that they could not help me. This place is absolutely ridiculous and I would never recommend this to anyone! Very over priced bbq with horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. No joke. I cannot believe I'm saying this about a restaurant that is basically a gas station, but I am. The food is bomb. They have a pretty large selection and my food, as well as my friend's, was excellent. It's totally worth potentially being seen eating here. No, seriously, it is."}
{"text":"Oh yeah, it lived up to the hype! I had the brisket salad and it was perfect! I added some BBQ sauce and with the blue cheese, oh heavens! I also tasted my Mom-in-laws pulled pork sandwich and it was SOOOOO good! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We came here because we saw it on the food network, it wasn't great. I've definitely had some better bbq. We sat in they're little dinning room and the waitresses were super awkward, kinda of rude. I gave three stars because the store was super cute!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am a master BBQ kcbs judge. I had heard this place was good so off we go.
No parking spaces open so looked around and finally parked by the car wash. Long line with one register open. When I got up to order the lady informed me she was fairly new. She took my order and had to re enter it six, yes six times. Two brisket sandwiches and side with drinks 36 bucks.
Went to table and stopped off for sauces. Took 4 kinds and tasted them before food came. They were either to hot or to bland. Food comes and did not do sweet fries did regular one. They were good though. Mac was very plain the metal bowl was the best part, no cheese or flavor. Beans were watery and no flavor. Slaw was plain. Brisket with pickles and onions on toasted bread it in half. Tried without sauce but found way over cooked and totally dry. No wood smoke or flavor. Put some sauce on but really could not help this poor excuse of BBQ. Place if it was good at one tine has lost its way.
Real BBQ can be found at miss Peggy's BBQ or Brian's black mt. BBQ.
I would tell you if you want real BBQ and not car wash food go to one of these I promise you you'll be easily able to tell the difference. Maybe a good car wash but certainly not a BBQ pit."}
{"text":"I've been a handful of times now and have yet to be let down. The brisket breakfast tacos are unbelievable. The B.E.L.T  is my favorite! 

The remodel is happy as well! Honestly, my favorite thing about this joint is the look on peoples faces when I tell them we're going to lunch/breakfast at the gas station."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is wonderful...from the moment you walk in the door where you are warmly greeted, to the second you leave where you say your goodbyes. While we were debating on what to get for my kids, the Assistant Manager Bill Cagle kindly and without any prompting, gave us a sample of the pulled chicken, pulled pork, and chopped brisket. What a kind gesture! The lovely woman taking our order was kind and knowledgable and really helped us decide which one of these lovely dishes we wanted. When we got our food, (which did not take that long) the food was fresh, and delicious. Definitely the best BBQ I've ever had. The chopped brisket sandwich was out of This world and the kids thoroughly enjoyed the Pulled Pork sliders. According to my wife and her friend, the Catfish sandwich was also commanding and delightful. I cannot say enough about Tom's thumb and their team. Guy Fieri may have brought us here, but it's the food, the staff, the management and the entire experience that will bring us back for years to come. Bravo!

{"text":"Oh is this place amazing!! Follow the cafe lights, it is a diamond in the rough and hidden. Beef Brisket and Pulled Pork sandwiches are yummy!!! I was in FL. On vacation and saw this on Diners, Drivein and Dives. And live 3 miles away and never knew!! AMAZING!! Can't go wrong!! Also have wonderful breakfasts served all day and a fun gift shop!! YEAH!!! Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"What a great concept. Very large restaurant space inside this enormous gas station / car wash. Unlike anything you would imagine in a gas station. Very clean and large space. TV's and outdoor seating. Gets pretty busy at lunch, but seems to always be seating available. Walk up and order off of their pretty large menu. Mostly barbecue, but a few other items. Also beer on tap. Food takes a few minutes to get out after ordering, but nothing terrible. Their barbecue is very good - especially for the southwest. Nothing that will blow you away, though. I'm a little biased because I've had the luxury of living in places where barbecue is a specialty. Great place to grab lunch if you're looking for something outside of the usual sandwich / mexican / fast food."}
{"text":"Recently I had a late lunch at Tom'sThumb
In Scottsdale. I asked some folks if there  was a Barbecue place nearby. And was directed here 
Inside I could tell by the fragrance of smoked meats and beans and sauces, that I was in the right place. 
My three meat platter was more than enough for me. But I sure wanted to try their cobbler. 
Lots of room inside fast service, and AWESOME. Food . 
Along with their homemade sauces and wonderful cornbread I would have to give them a big FIVE STAR. For everything there.  

When I first got there I did not realize it was inside the gas station. The decor is pretty neat. Similar to a  truck stop of the 60's. 
Big fish tank in the dining area kept a number of people occupied .
A GREAT PLACE TO EAT
I look forward to doing that the next time I come back through the area."}
{"text":"The only good car wash in Scottsdale and the food is ridiculously good.  So funny that this is a gas station, because sometimes I come here just to eat,  its that good"}
{"text":"What about the carwash you ask???  They do a great job.  Fairly priced and better then Dannys for sure.  Less busy too.  I had the mini detail done and it was under 1:30 and a great job.  So the food is pretty bomb.  Not much BBQ in these parts other then dickeys and the Baby back ribs at White Chocolate(Amazing).  For what they offer it is spot on with exception of the sides.  Oh they are tasty but WAY overpriced and WAY undersized which is unfortunate for a GAS STATION. The pulled pork, beans, slaw and brisket are perfect.  With the latter being spotty sometimes by being over smoked.  The salads were great and everything else we have had has been favorable.  I just can't get over the portion size and cost ratio even for North Scottsdale.  If that changed we would eat here more. One last thing is the service.  There is an older grouchy guy who works the counter at the restaurant.  Each time he is a DB.  Just saying.  Mean people suck.  Everyone else is cool but this guy is a grouch.  If you see him tell him to smile and not be grouchy.  It seems to piss him off more."}
{"text":"Disappointing. :/  drove the half an hour from Scottsdale.  They were apologizing as we approached the hostess for the long wait, even though we were seated right away and there were many open tables.  Then we were told that they were out of brisket and chicken...so only options were pork and non-brisket sandwiches.  I wanted the brisket, settled for a burger. Burger was very good, but not what I made the trip for.  Service was slow.  Drinks were slow to arrive.  Food took even longer, considering we only had a burger and pulled pork.  BBQ sauce station is poorly setup.  There is a sign describing the sauces, but its a hodgepodge of different size containers with dynotype labels on them.  Difficult to move quickly and select your sauce.

Visit again?  Not sure..there are better options closer to Scottsdale. :/"}
{"text":"I drive by this place everyday on my home from work.  So naturally, I grow curious about their \"award winning BBQ\" because the BBQ offerings in Phoenix are lacking and I'm in search of something....ANYTHING to help satisfy my cravings when I can't cook it myself.

Stopped in on the way home one night and ordered a BBQ plate with pulled pork, brisket, beans and Texas toast to-go.  There was a reasonable crowd inside, but they weren't \"slammed\".  I waited 30-45 minutes for my order to be ready.  This was not acceptable.  Real BBQ is not cooked to order since real BBQ takes hours to make so I could not understand why it took so long to assemble my order.

I get home and finally dig into the food and was highly disappointed.  The meat was dry, lacked seasoning and smoke flavor.  The beans were undercooked and also lacked flavor.  The Texas toast was quite simply a joke.  It was cheap quality white bread, was not buttered and certainly was not toasted.

I will end on a positive note by saying that the market was clean, had a lot of variety in wines, spirits, snacks, etc.  The atmosphere had a unique character, but it's just too bad that did not transfer over to their BBQ.  I guess my search continues for a decent plate of good BBQ."}
{"text":"I have been going to \"Tom's Thumb\" now called \"The Thumb\" for many years, the food here is excellent and I can't say that I have had anything that wasn't of top quality. My only complaint would be that pricing can be really expensive, especially for the casual style eatery it is. But you get what you pay for and that is especially true when eating at The Thumb. A must stop for anybody visiting in the north Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Food quality a 10. Had the pulled pork with chipotle sauce. A fun spot!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I live nearby and often get takeout from here. I personally love the pulled pork sandwich with fries and can't leave without the homemade ranch. As far as my fiancé goes he loves the variety of BBQ sauces and how tender the meat is. Best BBQ in north Scottsdale! If only they had a drive-thru."}
{"text":"Such great food! My daughter goes to school nearby, and after school she usually says she starving, so I gladly take her there for a quick bite. They recently remodeled and it looks amazing! My other kids love it too, this fish tank is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Racing fuel, car wash, and great BBQ! They do everything just right here! Really great customer service as well. I can go on about how great this place is but you'll have to experience it for yourself ;)"}
{"text":"Who would expect to find a great BBQ restaurant in a gas station/car wash?  Well, there is one on Bell Road in Scottsdale. A cute little venue inside the store with a lot of fun shopping items to browse while waiting for your food. The service was a bit sketchy and definitely slow, but the food was terrific! I tried the sliders and ordered one of each. They were equally delicious with creamy cole slaw to slip inside the bun. The variety and quality of sauces to try was top notch and I was a fan of several.

They did warn us that it was busy so I wasn't put off by the wait, however I noticed several tables returning food that was either incorrect or had some issue.  My suggestion would be to call your order ahead (think that's why it was so busy - due to a multitude of phone orders). 

Certainly worth a visit if you're looking for some nice smokey and tender BBQ meat!"}
{"text":"This is such a quirky place. It's a gas station and a restaurant and a bakery and a gift shop. Our family goes there at least a few times a year because the bbq is delicious and the mac and cheese is yummy. Very casual atmosphere. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"One of 4 Diner, Drives and Dives I visited this long weekend while taking in some Spring Training baseball. Don't miss this place! The service was very good. Wait staff, other than our server, stopped by our table to see if we needed anything a few times. The food was very good and portions were big! The Brisket sandwich was really awesome. I had some of the Pulled Pork and it was also very good! If your in the area, a must!"}
{"text":"I've been here two times. The first time was pretty good. I enjoyed the food and ambience. They have multiple tv's that usually play the big game if there is one. Easy to find seating and just a comfortable experience overall. It definitely wasn't the BEST BBQ I've ever had, but it worked. At that time, we just ordered from the counter and they would bring out our food. Simple, no?
The second time I come here (about a month ago), I am greeted by the first staff person who asks me if I am dining in, in which I reply yes. She then asks me if I want to be waited on.... which confuses me because this is not the way they operated the first time I came here. I ask her if I am allowed to just order normally and she says yes but then seems annoyed that I don't want a waitress. No offense, but if I have the choice to order my own food from the counter and NOT pay tip, then that's what I'm going to choose. I'm eating at a gas station not a 5 star restaurant. 
Then, we start looking at the menu to figure out what to order and another staff person comes up and asks the SAME QUESTIONS. We have to awkwardly tell her the same thing we told the other girl. Then, we go up to the counter to order, and then even the cash register once again asks us the SAME QUESTIONS. So if you've been paying attention, we were asked THREE different times to be waited on and every time we said no thank you, it was very obvious they were annoyed.
I wish it ended there but this experience gets much worse. When I receive my meal, I figure out that this is not what I ordered. No biggie... everyone makes mistakes right? So I take it up to the front to politely let them know and the person who took my order claims that I DID order that. Like I can't remember my own order? So I am standing there, awkwardly, waiting for her to fix her mistake and then the manager asks what's wrong. I tell him that \"I'm sorry but this is not what I ordered.\" I even hand him the plate so that he knows I'm not trying to scam them into getting multiple orders for free. He says that it's going to take 20 min for them to make what I ordered. I say that's fine, trying to be reasonable. He then asks if I want to just take the incorrect meal to-go and I say no thanks because I am going out of town the next day. Then, he tries to convince me to pack it up for my friend. At this point, I just want to go back to my seat so I'm like sure why not, I really just want to leave this conversation. Then, he makes a smarmy comment saying \"Well there's nothing we can really do with this sandwich besides throw it away if you don't take it.\" His tone was not light-hearted and VERY rude and made me feel super uncomfortable even though I wasn't the one who even made the mistake. If this is coming from the management here, then I understand why the rest of the staff is the way they are. 
In summary, I will not be coming back, mainly because of the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"You won't believe this, but the best bbq in North Scottsdale is at a gas station. They have a large menu with innovative choices. The kicker is that you also get to choose your bbq flavor! My personal menu favorite is the BBQ Pulled Pork tacos, but my favorite bbq sauce is still undecided. The Low Country is a sauce with bacon, bell peppers, and worcheshire. The Texas Chipotle is a sweet and spicy sauce. Both are friggin' fantastic, so you can't lose!"}
{"text":"Being a Southerner and an amateur smoke master living out West, finding decent BBQ, much less GREAT BBQ, has been a challenge.  That is until I stumbled into my neighborhood car wash a few years ago and smelled the sweet smell of hardwoods smoking meat.  Don't let the fact that they've built a car wash, gas station or convenience store AROUND a delicious restaurant scare you off...  The Thumb is the best BBQ this side of the Mississippi!  

I've never had a meal (whether it was breakfast, lunch or dinner) that wasn't literally finger licking good (sorry Col. Sanders).  Regardless of what your main course is, I highly recommend both the baked Mac & cheese and their Mexican corn as side dishes. Personally, I love the basics: ribs, brisket and pulled pork.  My wife is a huge fan of their BBQ tacos.

The Thumb is one of those hidden gems that I love taking guests to, as the idea of eating at a car wash seems odd until you walk through the doors to be met by the smell of smoke and the sound of happy people enjoying one of their awesome BBQ meals.  The Thumb was featured on the Food Network and once you taste their food you'll know why.  You can see Guy Fieri's pictures from his \"Diner's and Dives\" visit decorate throughout the restaurant and some of the show is on replay for your viewing pleasure.

They're recently poured a ton of money into a complete renovation of the inside and it is gorgeous.  Their carwash is pretty legit too. 

The Thumb is conveniently located next door to The Ice Den on Bell Road.  They have ample parking and the idea of getting your car based up and washed while eating a hearty and delicious meal is super appealing for those of us attempting to multi-task in today's fast paced world."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss.  I've had the brisket many times in the past. It was awesome almost every time.  Went today and the brisket was super DRY!  Come on guys..... QUALITY CONTROL!"}
{"text":"First time there for lunch with my son who is an expert!!  starting out his own catering business and has had expert training, been in contests and has done catering on the side!  Split lunch $25.00 plus tip in jar --- we split and if I had not paid that much would not have eaten any of it!!  Pulled pork very very dry, served ribs where most of it was cartilage, brisket very very thin cut and DRY!!!  We agreed the water and coke were ok---staff not friendly but hey they are doing ok We will not be going back!  My first review ever I think but I could not not review this place!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite for breakfast and lunch. My go to breakfast is the brisket tacos., and if you have a sweet tooth, pick up something from the bakery. This is a great place for shopping, car detailing, and gasoline."}
{"text":"This place is delicious, but I don't think it's a hidden gem anymore when the wait is 30+ minutes on Thursday at 2 PM. 

A great spot to have lunch/brunch though after a nice hike with the Arizona sun"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in town for BBQ!  Amazing food with plenty of choices on the menu.  My kids just loved the aquarium in the middle of the restaurant, too!  Can't go wrong looking at a beautiful aquarium while enjoying a wonderful meal.  I loved the store connected to the restaurant...it was such a pleasant surprise!  I will definitely be back to have lunch and my kids can't wait to see the aquarium again.  This place is a must see and dine!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a phenomenal experience! The French toast Sammy with eggs and bacon was so delicious! Mike and Newton took exceptional care of me during my time there and I LOVED all of the fun trinkets, paintings, photos and goods for sale."}
{"text":"This is good BBQ.  I rarely find pork that's as tasty as what I smoke but this is it.  That along with a car wash, gas station and gourmet food market....How can you beat it?"}
{"text":"Wanted to come here for lunch on my trip to Scottsdale this week, but my business schedule forced it to be a breakfast trip.  Had the Pigs and Grits and it was very good, but smaller than I expected based on the hype and pricing.

I do think lunch would be better as you would have more of an opportunity to try out all the sauces.  Service at the early hour was good despite them not really having the full staff organized yet.  They had the menu boards down and were working on them off to the side and not all the lights were on in the place."}
{"text":"How can I put this into words?  The thumb is an experience, not just a BBQ spot. Fun atmosphere, and cool things for sale!  The brisket entree was so amazing, it literally melts in your mouth. And the fries are so tasty, I couldn't get enough!  The blackened catfish is also delicious, the aoli on top is heavenly. Also, the mac and cheese is so creamy and yummy!  I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I just can't rave enough about this place.
First time getting my car wash detailed here, and the guys at the wash were so sweet, straight-forward, NOT pushy - a miracle!
Now I am sitting in their air conditioned restaurant/shop on their wi-fi and enjoying a delicious pulled pork sandwich. I mean it doesn't get any better.
Their shop is super cute and has lots of fun, unique things to browse and buy.

Thank you Tom's Thumb for everything you offer being top notch, clean, nice, welcoming. I will be back many times over!"}
{"text":"Tom's Thumb has one of the best pulled sandwiches pork I've ever had. The dining area is cute and usually not too busy. If you are looking for smaller portions, order off the kids menu!"}
{"text":"The car wash was fabulous. They got all the bugs from our trip from IL to AZ off of the car. I did ask for the tire pressure to be checked but they must have forgot to do it. The woman at the bakery counter where I paid for my wash was very nice. I tried the Smoked House Chicken Salad. The chicken had good flavor but I thought the salad was very cold. The salad was missing a crunch factor. Most of the yummy ingredients were at the very bottom of the bowl. The bowl tips over easily if you don't eat for the middle of the bowl. BEWARE! lol I really like the dining tables.
I will return and try something else while getting the car washed."}
{"text":"My friends kept suggesting that we go to Tom Thumb and I finally have in.  I was so mad at myself for waiting so long! The Pig and Grits is incredible! Make sure you get it with an egg on top:). I am a southern girl so it is pretty hard to impress me with a Grits dish... Blown away! You have to go, the gift shop has the most unique gifts as well."}
{"text":"Amazing. Not just because it was in DDD, but also because it's actually amazing. Everything on the menu knocks your socks off. Great brisket. Amazing BBQ, all in a gas station. Really funky concept and well executed here. Pro tip: if you want the BBQ, they often run out towards the end of the evening, as they legitimately smoke in house every day fresh. If you go an hour before close, they might not have brisket."}
{"text":"Wanted to follow up / expand on my initial review to say that we LOVE the food at Tom's - the BBQ is delish and it's definitely an easy stop off to grab a bite.  They have a really large selection of food items, both at the counter and throughout the store (there are even some organic / local items in the back fridge door - check 'em out!).  

The gas statement made in the first review was only in comparison to the area we live in, which is cheaper than most of the Phoenix central and Scottsdale areas since we are close-ish to Cave Creek gas prices in general seem to be cheaper in that area.  (Thanks Scott D. for pointing out any confusion that may have caused!)

Overall, their gas prices for N. Scottsdale are in the middle.  The Chevron around the corner is about $0.09 cheaper for a gallon at this moment, but let me tell you it's worth the extra $1.00 in gas to be able to get good food in a clean and friendly place!  I do fill up at this location on occassion when I am headed home and don't have enough gas to get there (I totally run the car down to \"E\" and live on the edge) and I'll always go in for snacks, candy or a drink.

Overall: gonna upgrade to an A-
The food is good.  Staff is friendly.  Gas is overpriced ONLY when compared to my home area - not in comparison to the surrounding area and it's worth the few extra cents to get some yummy food!"}
{"text":"In Scottsdale for a getaway weekend, I read about Tom's on yelp. As a lover of good BBQ the hubs and I were really looking forward to giving it a try. I would have to say it was good but not great. 
We had the stack which was a has brown patties with sliced brisket and topped with a fried egg. The has brown was a little mushy. We should have went with our first choice the sandwich but ended up changing our mind at the last minute and went with the triple D recommended item. Which I should have questioned since Guy doesn't even like eggs. My cousin ordered a half chicken salad sandwich and green salad. She made a better choice. Her salad was yummy with sunflower seeds, homemade croutons and dressed just right. 
Aside from the food they also have a fairly good size gift shop which I truly enjoyed looking through. If I were a local I would shop here for gift items."}
{"text":"Great BBQ very good selection of dishes for lunch and dinner We particularly like the combination meals that have smoked brisket,chicken and pulled pork
There are so many menu items and their vast selection of mild through hot sauces are excellent 
I would highly recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"This place is a gem!  At first, I was thinking, \"Seriously?  A gas station?  There's no way that they will have good food.\"  Prime example to not judge a book by it's cover.  When you go inside, it's like you are in a different place.  I've never seen a gas station as spruced up as this one.  Even the restrooms were clean and trendy.  The food wasn't bad at all.  Definitely worth a trip especially if you just hiked Tom's Thumb!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here for breakfast a few times now. Always made fresh to order, which in turn does take some time, but they will customize as much as possible (ie egg whites, double hash browns, bacon instead of chorizo). Amazing food. Decent wine selection for lunch/dinner options. And they ALWAYS have their smoker going = fresh delicious pork!"}
{"text":"We just had to visit this place after seeing it on DDD and we're still talking about the food and it was three days ago!!

I opted for the chopped salad as I felt I needed some greens given we'd be on vacation for almost a week and the hubs ordered the Platter with Beans and Baked Mac-n-Cheese. Much to my delight, the salad was hardy and quite filling.  The chicken was pulled and had just the right amount of smoke on it that paired perfectly with BBQ ranch dressing. I honestly didn't feel I was not throughly enjoying my vacation by ordering a salad with this baby, it was delicious.  The hubs didn't say two words from the moment he sat down to eat and basically all but licked the plate clean.  Needless to say, his meal was just as great.  He did let me have a spoonful of his mac-n-cheese and holy cow I'm happy he waited until he only had two bites left to offer me a bit, otherwise I would have commendared it from him!

And don't forget to walk around the rest of the store, there is such a great mix of fun gifts and trinkets....and one hell of a wine selection as well."}
{"text":"Ever been to The Thumb?  It is a truly unique location in North Scottsdale.  Right next to the Ice Den, it looks (from the outside) like a gas station and car wash, but inside is a wonderful restaurant, a from-scratch bakery, a wine shop, a gift shop, and a very cool aquarium.   This place has some of the best BBQ in town - great pulled pork, pulled chicken and brisket.  They also serve a wide variety of breakfast items - including some they serve all day.  The bakery is the best in North Scottsdale, with seasonal tarts, house made pastries, cookies (including some gluten free), brownies and morning coffee cake and the best cinnamon rolls in town.  Kids seem to love the aquarium - when was the last time you saw an aquarium with coyotes, rattlesnakes and cactus.  This is just a very fun, very relaxed (outside eating for dogs and people) and delicious spot for excellent food and meetings/conversations.  Oh yes, the car wash is also excellent."}
{"text":"Met friends at The Thumb for dinner after seeing it on television. It did not disappoint! The brisket was tender, the pulled pork had just the right amount of smoke flavor, and the baked macaroni and cheese was creamy and delicious. Miguel took our order and was super helpful in advising our choices. Walking around the store area was interesting, with all of the random items for sale. The fish tank is also amazing! I would recommend a stop for anyone who needs barbecue, gas, or a car wash!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ you can get from a gas station in Scottsdale or Phoenix.  The pulled pork sandwhich is just delicious.  The sauces are also pretty good."}
{"text":"We saw The Thumb on Check Please AZ and had to try it out. The food was excellent and service outstanding. We had a full rack of ribs, brisket, slaw, sweet potato fries, cheesy mac, beans, and corn bread. As advertised, all the food was delicious, and the sauce not to sweet. They hit every note perfectly. Great food, service, music, ambiance, and a gas station, car wash and extremely different and intriguing gift shop. We cannot day enough good about The Thumb, as it is beyond words. We will be back frequently."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  Found it on a list of DDD restaurants.  Get a pint of the Scottsdale Brewing Company beer with whatever you order."}
{"text":"We ordered the pork & grits and brisket platter.  I was expecting good food, but the I did not expect the FANTASTIC BBQ SAUCE.  The spicy BBQ sauce is deceptively spicy.  

This hole-in-the-wall disguised as gas station has a great brisket platter because it is layered with more than meat: 1. eggs, 2. brisket, 3. large has hash-brown."}
{"text":"This is an unbelievable restaurant in a gas station. Of course you've heard that already. The brisket is incredible.  Pulled pork, not bad either. Drink prices are good with a good selection. Strongly recommend this joint, and if they had silverware it would be even better!"}
{"text":"The Campfire Grille just doesn't seem the same as when the restaurant first opened or when I was there about six months ago.  They no longer have roasted chicken on the menu. The cashier seemed to have a major attitude or was having a bad day. The chili was more watery than in the past. Did the original chef/owner of the restaurant sell it?"}
{"text":"Being a bit skeptical about the concept of what I thought this place was (kinda like a Danny's Car wash plus food) , Peg and I checked it out for breakfast this am. I was so pleasantly surprised!  The full service breakfast (and Janelle could not have been more cheerful or helpful)  was legit. It's not just a \"let's order coffee and a danish at the counter\" venue, although that is a possibility if you don't have the time to sit down. The pulled pork was good, the grit cakes were yummy (beneath a couple of nicely over easy eggs), and the coffee was at least above average. When 18 degrees blows hot and cold, and Over Easy isn't at times, this place is a nice addition to the neighborhood.  When we browsed and saw Tracy Dempsey products on the shelves...it tells you what you need to know!  Dr. B"}
{"text":"If you crave BBQ smoked deliciousness, Tom Thumb is a MUST! The slow-cooked ribs were \"fall off the bone\" tender. The choice of sauces is impressive, and do yourself (and your tastebuds) a favor and get the Mexicorn side dish. Finally, the waitstaff (Morgan and Hanna) are super friendly and attentive! What are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! By the location,  I didn't know what to expect..but we were so surprised when we walked in to find such a cool place! Eclectic decor, casual and stylish, but most importantly,  the food is amazing! I had the pulled pork tacos and my friends, the pulled pork sandwich and the Cuban. So delicious and very friendly,  attentive staff.  We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Drove 5 hours away from home to eat here and man their food is amazing!!!It is definitely worth our drive...Try their Pigs and Grits and beef brisket stack...Great staff too!!! GM is very welcoming #tomsthumb #2thumbsupforyou"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and the inside is decorated so nice. I love the different seating arrangements, the fish tank and bakery kitchen off to the side. My meal was the blackened catfish sandwich. It was very good and came with  red onion, lettuce, pickles and a little spicy sauce on the side. Friends had pulled pork and stated it was also delicious. My sandwich came with only chips and it was $11.33 with tax. I'm thinking a tad high for a sandwich on the small side. Staff is great. Will be back to try something else."}
{"text":"This place is a great Saturday morning stop. We love everything on the menu but our favorites are the stack, the brisket tacos, baked Mac n cheese and the cornbread. It's a cool eclectic place with drinks, souvenirs and knock-knacks, fish tank and all around good family friendly vibe. There are an array of special BBQ sauces to try on your meats as well. We like the To-To and the Memphis mop!!! This place is definitely a must try in Scottsdale and it was on Diners Drive-ins and Dives as well! It's clean and the staff is friendly. Prices are a bit high but portions are good and the food is fresh and homemade!!!!"}
{"text":"....back again all the way from good old Blighty and everything's as great as it was last year.  Well done Colonials and keep up the good work ;)
Ta tah!?"}
{"text":"Found a new place to go to lunch & a great place to wash the car. Their gas station has good food that is decently priced. Pulled pork sandwich & chips for 9 bucks! 

I've been looking for a good place to wash my car because I wasn't satisfied with the service from Jackson's. I found this place on Yelp and read the amazing reviews about the car washes so I thought I'd give it a try. The washes are expensive, but the Yelp discount makes the price somewhat average. I got my exterior washed for $6.99. In the waiting room, they have TV's that allow you to see where your car is going at all times. I waited 15 minutes for my car & it was finished. I asked them how much it would cost to buff my scratches out and they told me they'd do it for free. They buffed everything out within 10 minutes. Ask for Brandon, Dustin, or terry and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Phenomenal BBQ!  Gas station, car wash, collectibles and mouth watering, perfectly smoked BBQ!  Gotta love this place!  Get your car washed and topped off with petro all while you stuff your mouth with the best BBQ west of the Mississippi!"}
{"text":"Can't rave about this place enough!  BEST carwash in Scottsdale - hands down!  Consistently do an awesome job - and I love the 7 day guarantee!!!  While you get your car washed - you can grab a drink or enjoy a meal!  I've had breakfast, lunch, and dinner there.  Food has always been fantastic and fresh!  Bonus - the patio that you can eat outside.  Want to do a little shopping?  Neat items inside to buy.  If you haven't checked it out - it's a MUST!!!"}
{"text":"Appreciate that Michael reached out to listen to the feedback.  I will absolutely give Tom's Thumb another chance and then will update my review.  Great when a business wants to hear from all customers for continuous improvement."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! From the car wash to the BBQ!! Man O man it has changed my life for the better!! The manager and the staff were so helpful and courteous. I wish I was there right now!!"}
{"text":"Tom-
Just had my best wash ever! Been coming for over a year and you always have done a great job/value, but today you hit it out of the ballpark! Hard to please me because I drive a black hard-top convertible with many  crevasses for water/streaks.  Newton and his team went the extra mile and made sure I was happy with the wash.  So nice I can be eating an amazing breakfast while I wait. Love to multitask-Win/Win! Thanks Tom.

{"text":"Took the kids here after swimming.  Disappointed in the food.  I ordered the brisket platter and over 50% of the meat was fat (see photo).  Bus boy came by to ask how the food was and gestures so-so.  He walked away without acknowledging.  The corn bread was very dry.  Almost $30 for three of us to eat lunch (two meals) and the kids are leaving hungry."}
{"text":"My first car wash didn't go so well.  The general manager, Mike had me come back for a complimentary wash. They did a much better job but they do need to spray and wipe the windshield since there was still a dead bug left again. I will continue to come here with my new car to avoid scratches that you get from Cobblestone! But won't expect my car to come out completely clean!

We had lunch at the newly remodeled cafe today and it was busy! Food was decent. Brenda, manager quickly replaced my bbq sandwich bun that came out soggy. 

Unfortunately, they don't sell smoked meat by a quarter pound anymore. Manager said owner took it off and wasn't accommodating. It was the right amount for my kids. Not happy. We come here at least twice a month. Will have to find another place for lunch."}
{"text":"This BBQ was so good!! I am not a huge bbq fan but my husband is. I had the tacos and got one of each (chicken, pork, brisket). The chicken and pork were outstanding!! My hubby ate the brisket and enjoyed it as well. I had the Mexicali corn and it was also delicious!! We will very likely become regulars!!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal with the family after ice skating.  The crew was hungry & BBQ was amazing from the brisket platter which was super tasty, the BBQ ribs were finger licking good, and the chicken sandwich was delicious....along with the sides of french fries very yummy, corn was amazing & mac & cheese was a hit with the kids.

Plus roaming through the store great assortment of cards & gifts that are eclectic for that hard to buy person...will definitely be back.

Overall great experience with the kids!"}
{"text":"This place is off the charts awesome!  Adorable and surprising setting -in a gas station, no less!!  Everything from the barbecue, to the sides, to even the ranch dressing was beyond excellent!  We will definitely be back very soon!!!!"}
{"text":"True barbecue in scottsdale is hard to find but Tom's Thumb knows how to do it.
Everything is good. Brisket is up there with the best."}
{"text":"The service is exceptional. Great place to have lunch while your car is being detailed. Free WiFi and wall sockets let you work, and eat at the same time. I had the brisket and loved it!

I even picked up a few things for dinner that night. All in one place!"}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be. Definitely has gone down hill since its special on diners drives and dives.

Some of the new bbq sauces aren't as good as the old ones 

Two meet plate: Pork and beef brisket was delicious 
Shoe string fries and mexicorn"}
{"text":"Very cleaver concept of car wash and fancy/casual eating place. Definitely this place is not the usual car wash for sure. It's is very unique and cute.

I'm not red meat eater but I still can find something that I like. I had chicken sandwich and it was delicious!

The gift shop section has cute stuff and everyone seems friendly here.

The only negative about this place is the  sweet tea wasn't my favorite at all, way to sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"The owner has apologized and I'm sure appropriate actions will take place."}
{"text":"We went to Tom's Thumb Market early on a Friday night and it was pretty busy. We proceeded to ask the waitress a few questions about the food including if there was any dairy in the BBQ sauce and she appeared less than enthused about finding out. For some reason she thought it was a good idea to make fun of my guest about having food allergies. Despite the waitress, the food was great and for that we might return."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese was great, I'd also recommend the brisket sandwich. Great environment and friendly staff!! Food prices are a bit high but I would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The place has southern big Tex BBQ dialed in.  Great lil stop, super friendly staff and family operated.  You will not find better BBQ in Arizona!  The pricing is affordable as well.  I wish they had more locations in AZ..."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood and this place was recommended and, when it was featured Diners,Drive-ins, and Dives it looked pretty tasty! The meat platter was recommended so, I got that and my Son got the Taco's. My Son liked the Taco's but, the meat platter was bad! Maybe because we got there around 3 the food had been held for a long time. The biscuit was dry, the pulled pork dry and, the chicken was dry! Had a side of the Mac and cheese. Was cheesy but not much flavor. Just a salt would have made a world of difference! Had Mexican corn. It was good. Boxed up the leftovers. Nobody at home would ear it. Tossed it.
Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Tom's Thumb for breakfast tacos and they did not disappoint. Since I had never been before I asked if I could try one pork and one brisket and they happily accommodated me. They gave us a number and said it would be about 15 minutes but the food came out in less time. 

The tacos are pretty large - definitely big enough for a full meal. They were stuffed with eggs, potatoes, cheese and the meat. They were served with salsa or you can add one of the BBQ sauces that are on the table. The salsa was actually really tasty so I opted for that over the BBQ sauce.

The brisket was the clear winner. The pork was just okay. Honestly it was a little dry. It wasn't bad all mixed up with the other stuff in the taco, but on it's own it was a little lackluster. The brisket was more flavorful and juicy.

This place is no typical gas station restaurant for sure. The atmosphere is great and the people working there were very friendly. I'm looking forward to going back and trying dinner."}
{"text":"We had breakfast and everything tasted fine. Everything else about this place ok. Nice people, cute decor and concept."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town.  The pork lolly pops are outstanding.  We always bring guests from out of town here.  It's great seeing people's reaction to gas station food.  Forget it being a gas station as it's better than most restaurants.  It can be packed at lunch but is worth the wait and the line moves fairly quick."}
{"text":"Went there because it was on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives, as well as having an aquarium featured on TANKED. The GM approached my girlfriend and I while we were looking at the menu, overwhelmed with hunger and the many delicious choices and gave us free samples of their pulled pork, pulled chicken, and lean brisket to help decide. Very informative and surprisingly great service. Will definitely stop by next time."}
{"text":"Yes, yes and yes. The food is amazing. You can pick up your next gift you need to but, get gas, get your car washed... so good. I laughed when my friend invited me to go eat at a gas station. I was delightfully surprised by how amazing the food was. I've gone back so many times with out of towners. 

Casual dining, plenty of things to explore and enjoy (especially the giant fish tank). Love it. Check it out!!

Also.. get the brisket and the macaroni and cheese. Work on your cholesterol another day! :)"}
{"text":"Best BBQ. Great breakfast burrito. Fun stuff to buy for the wife. The coolest coke machine. Oh yeah, the best car wash in town.  Yeah I think this place is a consistent winner."}
{"text":"What a unique place!  The food was great, the customer service exceptional and the ambience a kick.  Very clean and fun.  There was a line when we left!"}
{"text":"For a gas station / car wash this place was very nice, had great atmosphere, the pulled pork barbecue sandwich n sauce was moderately priced and service was ok.  Cashier was lacking interest his job and the patrons.  The waiters appeared focused on doing there side work after lunch rush.  The portions appear to be nice sized.  Cleanliness of cafe was very good.  I would highly recommend this place to all my family and friends who are looking for a quick breakfast or lunch.  They have free wifi as well! The urban farm meets modern decor is entertaining and nice."}
{"text":"My family and I took a trip to Scottsdale last month. We were told about The Thumb from the concierge at our hotel. My boyfriend LOVES BBQ and housemade sauces so we knew we had to try it. We went for lunch one day and was blown away! After lunch we spent another 30 minutes walking around the store! We loved it so much that we all went back the following night for dinner and bought 3 of their housemade sauces. We are already running out of them and wondering how to get more! We love The Thumb & will be back!"}
{"text":"The only car wash I take my cars to.  While I'm waiting for my car I'll sit and have an awesome breakfast.  Try the bakery for the best cupcakes."}
{"text":"It's been several months since my last trip to AZ, but I knew that once I returned, I'd have to make the trek over to this place to try some more of their delish food items. I can only say that BOY they did not disappoint!!! I ordered the brisket stack and was so glad I did. Homemade cheesy hash brown cakes topped with sliced brisket, chipotle aioli and a fried egg -- seriously? What food genius came up with that one???? I only know it works, and brilliantly. Also can't say enough good stuff about the fabulous staff. Always efficient and wonderfully friendly. This is a place I will go to time and time again whenever I find myself in the Scottsdale area. Kudos to the Thumb!!"}
{"text":"So glad to have a gas station & car wash close to my office again! They have fresh lunch options too which is a huge plus."}
{"text":"Who has ever heard of a gas station/car wash where you look forward to going? This is the one!
Not only do they reduce the cost of your fuel if you choose to get a wash, but they do a FINE job of car washing. Their people are professional, very kind, articulate and generous. Forgot extra cash? Tip NEXT time.
Now, here is the thing: while you wait for your car, you can eat some of the best BBQ you will have, or shop for the cutest gifts, cards, cool home items, wine, holiday items...It's ridiculous! I never leave without seeing something I MUST have - for me, or a friend/friends.
There are also numerous coolers, in case you just need milk or some small item.
They have a coffee bar, with wonderful looking muffins, etc. And, there is a full restaurant, with seating areas all over the store.
Several times I have been there, I have seen groups of women, playing cards or Mah Jong! And no one is irritated that they are taking up seats! It feels like a good old-fashioned neighborhood spot, where you meet old friends and new!
This happens to be the closest place for me to fill up my car and get it washed, but I would go anyway! 
Oh - did I mention that the restaurant (BBQ) CATERS and does take-out?
You absolutely MUST see this for yourself.
Try it. I KNOW you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ you'll have! Amazing car wash service and reasonably priced gas prices. The staff is always friendly and creates an atmosphere that influences future visits! They even have a free air station!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, waitress messed up two orders and couldn't even come out and apologize. Food is decent but the kitchen and staff need to step up their game and not act like timid children when they get things wrong."}
{"text":"This is one of my new fav places to eat. I'm addicted to the brisket and fries. I haven't had brisket this good since \"back home\" in Louisiana. While they do have homemade sauces, you don't need it! I'm not big on bbq sauce...so, I look for brisket that has enough of its own flavor to stand alone. And, the fries are so, so good. The pulled pork is really good, too. 
For those of you who know Bryan's in Cave Creek, this place is better! I really want to try breakfast one day."}
{"text":"Only thing was the food was cold but other wise food was awesome and a lot of food friendly staff and best part was the fish tank from tanked on animal plant we had the platter the chicken sandwich  I would go back but I will request to make sure the food is hot"}
{"text":"Wow. This was unexpected. It's a full service gas station. It's got a beautifully decorated restaurant and gift shop inside. Lots of patio seating as well. 

What a fabulous menu!  We came for brunch. I ordered the Pigs and Grits. Creamy, cheesy grits piled with spicy bacon and crispy pulled pork. Lovely presentation in a small iron skillet on a metal baking sheet. The hubs had Toms Brisket Stack - sliced brisket and eggs over crispy potatoes cakes.  We are in a food coma!! 

I want to try their bean-less chili made with pork.  And they have apple crisp and peach cobbler!  

I've been watching the food come out of the kitchen and everything looks great. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is eclectic and delishious.  It is a gas station, car wash, BBQ place and eclectic store all in one.   Everything in the place is for sale, even the seats you sit on to eat!  So fun.  Best mac and cheese. Supposedly the best BBQ too. I don't eat meat so I can't rate it, but my family and friends love it!!!"}
{"text":"Flew into town and needed to find a quick meal. For some reason i was thinking \"BBQ would be awesome!\" so started googling and searching Yelp only to find this Tom's very highly rated. So I drove on over and  was pleasantly surprised by 1) how easy it was to get to 2) how clean and interesting the place is 3) the folks working there were super helpful and 4) the food was great! 

I've had better all around meals but I went ahead and gave 5 stars because the brisket was great, the selection of sauces was excellent (I'm not usually a sauce person and just go for the brisket) and everything was exactly what I wanted on a Sunday afternoon in Scottsdale!

Now I'm just plotting for how to get the guys from work over to this place some afternoon."}
{"text":"Food was good, pricing ok, process from taking the order to delivering the food is awful. The process takes twice as long as it needs to. They were crowded so people must not care. I do not plan to go back"}
{"text":"Oh so yummy.   The breakfast actually turned to lunch.   3 outstanding tacos Pulled Chicken & Pork and Brisket.   I didn't get my car washed as rain was in the forecast.    My spouse had the 2 meat plate and didn't share.   He was highly impressed, service was stellar and refills on drinks never stopped.   

The menu has a nice variety for every appetite.   Do try the corn, it was a nice treat and they even cut it in half for sharing.    Don't stop there, make sure to finish it off with a nice tasty desert.    The cupcake was just the right bite to finish a very nice morning."}
{"text":"Had the pigs and grits. Ordered quickly but it took them a while to bring the food out. Like 20 mins. Dont go if you are in a hurry unless you are ordering take out. They have a ton of bbq sauces. All real great. Prices are good. Food is great. In the mood for bbq or breakfast try it."}
{"text":"Wonderful BBQ place with a huge menu selection to choose from.  They even offered to give me a couple of samples so I could decide what to order.    We ordered lean beef brisket and their awesome ribs.  Both were wonderful and tasty.  They have a huge array of side choices to choose from.  Definitely recommend this BBQ!"}
{"text":"So delicious!  This feels like a real country gas station with great brisket.  I got the brisket sandwich with baked Mac & Cheese.  Sandwich was really flavorful.  If you like some spice, mix the hickory sauce with the habanero.  Next time I am getting the corn; saw another table with it and looked fantastic."}
{"text":"Good food in a gas station? It's true.

My husband stopped by here for lunch last week and brought back this amazing barbeque pork sandwich with some of the best shoestring fries I've ever had. One bite and I was hooked. Since then we have been here 2 times and both times the service has been fast and the food delicious. The food is fresh and tasty - for both breakfast and lunch. My husband and I split a breakfast wrap and this was no ordinary wrap. Whole wheat tortilla stuffed with scrambled eggs, grilled peppers and onions, jalapeno bacon and cheddar cheese - definitely enough food for two. The second time we went for lunch my husband got the special of the day, Fried Catfish. My husband devoured it. I tried a bite and it was really good - it wasn't fishy tasting and the plating looked really nice. I got the pulled pork sandwich with shoestring fries which came in a basket. I'd prefer a plate, but this didn't affect the taste! All their meats are slow smoked and have this great \"campfire\" taste.  All items come sans barbeque because they have their own barbeque bar! You can pick and choose which sauces you want to use. I recommend the Low Country BBQ (has BACON and peppers) and the Texas Chipotle. Both are a little sweet but super addictive. 

Even the decor inside is nice and simple. I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area or just want to try some new BBQ."}
{"text":"Good but a bit overrated on Yelp.  Yes, the bbq is smokey and tender, but you have to season the food, too, and too much smoke doesn't taste good.  I think they are on the right track, but they need to tweak it a bit. Frankly, this place just confirms for me that all of Guy Fieri's taste is in his hindquarters."}
{"text":"I work right next door to Tom Thumb Fresh Market - It's my go to spot for lattes, gummy bears for an afternoon snack and when the boss isn't keeping me tied to my desk I love to come here for lunch and enjoy some delicious BBQ. 
Toms Market is a neat place in North Scottsdale, Not only do they offer car washes, gas and good bbq but it's also a neat spot to stop by for a cool gift for someone"}
{"text":"AMAZING BRISKET!! There is a casual order at the counter REAL BBQ restaurant... AT THE GAS STATION!?!?!?!?   I do have my own smoker & know good BBQ.  This stuff melts in your mouth and is not over smoky (amazing considering their 14 hr Hickory wood smoking time) I only had the brisket sandwich so far. Pink smoke ring, 4 sauces to choose from, served on proper Texas toast & the shoestring fries, ya know, normal gas station fare;)

I know it seems weird \"honey I'm off to the gas station to pick up dinner\" but actually... best bbq brisket i have had between here & Joe's real BBQ in Gilbert. I'll update when I try the pork, but Brisket is much tougher to smoke & keep moist so I always try that first at a new BBQ joint. The sell meat by the LB to go as well. Let's support this amazing concept.

UPDATE-Tried the takeout brisket by the lb and half chicken, see my new photos. Even the chicken wing was moist!  That's no easy feat. Brisket was as great as I remember, that's why i bought a pound!!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch with the family here. Two hamburger combos, two pulled pork sandwiches, and a Cuban. All very tasty including perfectly crispy shoestring fries, along with flowing variety flavored soda machine. Acknowledging  and friendly service except for the girl initially at register closing one register down. One bit of advice if you're going to be at the front working in a service oriented industry: acknowledging the customers is first and foremost even if you're 'busy' counting $, at least say 'someone will be right with you' instead of left ignoring the customers and left wondering if someone else will be helping us. Either that or go in the back where no one can see your snobby self."}
{"text":"They are not a full blown restaurant so expect service to be poor. The food is good but expect to wait because they are not efficient in filling orders. My husband order literally came a good 10min after the rest of the group had gotten their food. 

However, their food was good esp for a restaurant in a gas station. I love the jalapeño bacon if only they cooked it crispy as ordered. I had the pulled pork & scramble egg dish with grits. BBQ sauce was a bit on the sweet side for me. But they have a side station where you can get 4-5 other sauces. I enjoyed the South Carolina sauce more so than the BBQ sauce. Grits was tasteless and definitely needed the salt and butter.

The bakery looks decent with limited selection. We sampled their cinnamon roll and didn't really care for it. It was rather dry and tough but maybe it was because they were the mini version? 

They sell really nice and cute home, kids and girl's stuffs. But be warned, they were overpriced."}
{"text":"Stopped in once again for a car wash at this amazing place.  Not really at a meal time so we just had local beer and pretzels.  We go out of our way when in the Phoenix area to get the superior inside and outside car cleaning this place gives, and we always enjoy shopping and marveling over the unique art objects and gifts they have assembled for sale."}
{"text":"The place is a gas station with a car wash, but, if you go inside you see a restaurant as well.  It's a BBQ joint with a real smoker and rotating racks with pork shoulders, butts, rib racks and large beef briskets roasted 12 hours to a dark bark.  We went twice and had the best BBQ brisket sandwiches with grilled onions and sauce.  Generous portions of meat.  The best sweet potato fries.  Two kinds of cole slaw, the regular one with cream and mayo and the other vinegar based.  The sauce for the ribs is a sweet molasses based sauce, possibly too sweet for some peoples taste.  The ribs are made like competition ribs, with a chew, not falling off the bone.  Good flavor to the ribs.  A MUST VISIT is the pastry case.  Seems this little gas station & car wash happened to corral a pastry chef from a luxury hotel who fills the case with great pastries at reasonable prices.  We will come back when we return to Scottsdale.  it's on Bell just to the East of the 101."}
{"text":"Service is awful. They forgot my food, I asked for it 3 times and they kept saying it was coming. After everyone else was done eating I finally asked for a refund. The manager sucks, gave me a refund, didn't say sorry or offer anything else. Never coming here again"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat!! The chicken sandwich is fresh and is a very large portion of a chicken breast. They also sell their pulled pork and pulled chicken by the pound. Fun things sold there...great card selection! Oh and you can also get gas and your car washed!"}
{"text":"Went out of the way to Tom's Thumb for supper to see if we agreed with Guy's DDD review.   No so much.  The pulled pork was average.   Sadly, it needed sauce and they were out.  Seriously?   The only ones available were the\"XXX\" hot sauce and the very-liquid, sweet Carolina sauce. Mercifully,  a waitress found some marked \"hickory\" that was just grocery store sauce, but better than nothing!   

My husband got the blackened catfish fillet which, he said, was quite tasty.   It had a spicy kick that he liked.   

Sadly,  we waited for 45 minutes for our food and watched the wait staff struggling to do their jobs.  

For the price of our meals, I suppose it was a good value.  It was just nothing that wonderful.   Sorry to disagree with Guy! 

This place has a cute gift shop,  wine,  pastries,  coffees and a car wash and gas station.  I would suggest that they train the staff and order some sauces (or make some) and get their act together. I would suggest that they choose one thing on which to focus and do it well,  but that's the novelty.    We'll stop by again and see if they do--- if we're in the area.  I would suggest others wait a while."}
{"text":"I heard it was at a gas station.  I was leery about the recommendation to go here.  But I'm so glad I did.  I was impressed with the flavors.  Baked Mac m cheese was delish.  I liked it so much, I went back a second time in the same week."}
{"text":"Gas station, car wash, BBQ, bakery, cafe, convenience store, and gift shop. This place is unique for sure. The BBQ is surprisingly good for what you'd expect. Just moved from Atlanta and this place can settle my bbq cravings."}
{"text":"I had the privilege of attending an Elite event here and I got to meet Chef Kelly. I cannot be grateful enough because she just made us some amazing custom cupcakes for a Breaking Bad finale party I went to at a friend's house.  I gave her some slight instruction and had an idea in my head. 

She went above and beyond.

Hello, she custom made the 'blue meth' rock candy to sprinkle on our blue velvet cupcakes. She also made two small cookies with the Br/Ba adornment. 

We were sooo beyond pleased with how these turned out.  And of course, they were delicious too!  My friends and I love a theme party and I will for sure be using Chef Kelly for custom cupcakes, cakes, etc."}
{"text":"Little gem hidden as a front for a gas station. High end looking BBQ place. 

Just plain good BBQ.  I hate my meat drowning in sauce. That's not real BBQ.  Their smoked pork and chicken is just that - smoked. They've got several sauces for you to try out which aren't too bad either considering I don't usually like sauces.  Chipotle being the favorite for me and my friends. Brisket is good too from what friends tell me. 

Prices are about right for BBQ. Love that it's down the street too. Highly recommend you check it out. They've got a great little gift shop too."}
{"text":"Get the Pig & Grits with an egg sunny side up. Yes. Just do it. 

The Brisket Stack left something to be desired, but the mac and cheese has the perfect amount of flavor and crunch. 

I know everyone says it, but I still think it's so bizarre how such good food is served in a gas station. We enjoyed walking around seeing all the farmer-chic tables throughout the gift shop area available to sit at. But it was pretty cluttered otherwise, so we sat on the super quaint and adorably lit patio."}
{"text":"I love this place! the food is really fresh and delicious. i've had the grilled chicken salad a few times, and it's always delicious - the honey chipotle vinaigrette is wonderful! i've also had the bacon eggs benedict for breakfast, which was also really good. my grandma's bleu cheese burger was excellent! i highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome staff, great breakfast burrito and taco options! Very clean and neat atmosphere in an old gas station."}
{"text":"Best pulled pork west of Texas in my opinion! You can't go wrong with their pulled pork sandwich. The BBQ sauces they offer are a tasty addition to the sandwich - I loved the chipotle and habanero sauces. The atmosphere is great. Reminds me of a BBQ spot I would find in my home state of Texas with the adorable country store and gas station attached. Happy to have found a spot to grab a delicious pulled pork sandwich in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I'll give management at The Thumb some big props. Michael reached out to me in a private message, and as a response to my review, not long after it was posted. We even spoke on the phone for a little more than 10 minutes today. He addressed the situation that led to my poor review, took my concerns to heart, and even come up with some potential solutions.

As you can see from other reviews, he takes the time to respond whether it's good or bad. I greatly appreciate any business where management takes the time to interact with its customers, and legitimately listen to their complaints and compliments.

I will definitely give The Thumb another try in the near future."}
{"text":"favorite bbq place in scottsdale with the best car wash and small gift shop attached!  can't beat the convenience of getting your car washed while enjoying the best bbq pulled pork sandwich and great fries in a cute little store!  Pretty good wine selection as well with cute gifts!"}
{"text":"I had the Mac and cheese along with the pulled pork sandwich and the spicy BBQ sauce. The pulled porks flavor was delicious and had an authentic smoke flavor. The BBQ sauce was really good. It's not spicy at first but kicks in a little later. The MAC and cheese flavor was good, it's very cheesy, almost too much cheese (I can't believe I'm saying that). Great flavor though. The only downfall was the pork had a lot of fat in it. But overall great place for some pork!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Went there to get a Tom's hand wash for my car and had lunch while I waited.  Got the pulled BBQ chicken sandwich with chips and a soda.....really good! They did a great job on my car....I will be returning very soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place as their food is delicious. The stuff they put on the corn is to die for. Definitely a spot to go to. It's also a store that sells fun Arizona trinkets. Well worth the stop. Would have given it 5 stars but every time I go, their tea is always out. Other than that, it's pretty legit!"}
{"text":"Husband and I saw this on DD&D so had to try it on our recent trip to Scottsdale. Beef brisket was great, pulled pork sliders were good also. Very unique experience. Car wash, bakery, BBQ and great gift shop. Try it!!"}
{"text":"We're in town for the weekend. My son told us we need to go to Tom's Thumb. We pulled into the gas station/car wash. I started thinking what is my son thinking?  Came in to an incredibly fun atmosphere. Just had the pulled smoked chicken sandwich.  I have never had such an incredibly tasty sandwich. I recommend this place to EVERYONE. They also have a bakery. Of course we had to try something there. Again, the best!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try out Tom's Thumb for a while.  Sadly I missed the Yelp event here a few months ago.  Lucky for me I had a carshow at near by westworld and finally had an excuse to stop on by.  

This place is cool, it's an all in one carwash, BBQ, bakery, and convenice store.  I really liked the idea.  Reminds me of an upsale Rudy's in Texas.   Ordered the pulled pork sandwich and brisket sandwich and shared with my friend,  I liked them booth but the pulled pork was my favorite.  

I also ordered a cupcake which was yummy as well.  I enjoyed my lunch and would come back."}
{"text":"Really good brisket sandwich!!! I am extremely satisfied after eating the sliced brisket sandwich!"}
{"text":"Love this place. 
You drive up thinking, what the heck. I'm at a gas station/car wash? 
Just walk inside... This place is amazing. They have the best food, bbq, salads, sandwiches. 
Came here with a group of 9 and they were so nice and accommodating. Bill was super friendly along with all of the staff. 
Even their bakery is awesome!
Basically, come in and order some food, get gas and a car wash, and enjoy some of the best food around!"}
{"text":"I am not sure I understand what the hype is all about. I had a pulled chicken platter with baked beans and vinegar slaw and everything was mediocre at best. The pulled chicken was greasy and bland, and was covered in a tasteless sauce (Why even bother putting BBQ sauce on the table?). The slaw had no flavor, and the beans were adequate, but a bit mushy. I have had good bbq all over the country, but this makes Tony Roma's or Dickies look excellent in comparison."}
{"text":"Just paid $20 for exterior wash, interior vacuum, interior windows and wipe down. Took 55 mins. Still bits of grass on driver's floor mat, kids hand prints inside back window, did not clean out cup holder, gear shift leather or inside door wells. Watched two different people wash the same exterior window 5 mins apart. Absolutely no hustle, ambivalent attitude, zero organization and overall poor work. My car is brand new. This was the first ever wash and will be  the last at this establishment."}
{"text":"This is one stop shopping at its finest! You can do it all ! Fill up your gas tank , get a car wash , grab a few bottles of wine , gourmet presents & chocolate & sit under a beautiful chandelier while enjoying mouth watering BBQ! \"Shut your mouth good ! \" We fell in love with some of the decor & rustic bar stools & they are for sale as well! This eclectic spot also has an in house bakery with mouth watering treats ! We were all impressed at how many fun items we kept finding ! Can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"Great BBQ! I am not a BBQ food fan but wow this restaurant is amazing :-) I would highly recommend this place to any and everyone!!"}
{"text":"AH-MAZE-BALLS!!!
This is the best BBQ in Phoenix. I had the brisket sandwich. It was very tender with a nice smoke ring. I enjoyed it with the hickory sauce.
Fast service. Clean establishment... it is even better with the new renovations. If you have not been here, you need to go."}
{"text":"After my 1st visit, that manager contacted me to say that my experience wasn't up to their standards and would I like to come in and give them another shot, on the house?  Hell, yes I would!!  It means alot to even have a manager respond positively to a customer's poor experience and I told him so.  Nice service recovery (and I need to speak up faster when things aren't up to snuff.  My bad.)  Anyway, went in for breakfast on a Friday.  I ordered the Chorizo and eggs breakfast tacos and a vanilla latte.  The tacos came out pretty quickly; about the same wait time as other diners' around me, so it didn't seem like they put me on a stat order or anything.  The order has two soft tacos on flour tortillas, with a side of salsa.  They were full, but not stuffed.  The eggs were fluffy and hot, the chorizo was not greasy AT ALL (an accomplishment in itself) and the salsa tasted homemade with a nice balance of cilantro and tomato.  The tortillas were fresh and the portions was great.  I struggled to eat the second one; couldn't finish in fact.  This was the experience I wish my 1st one had been.  It was great.  I'll be back now!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick BBQ bite and a car wash you can trust to get a quality clean!"}
{"text":"My first impression was that it was a little over priced for my tastes. However, after tasting the food, I got to meet with the chef and Tonya is a master on the grill!! I see why the food is priced the way it is!! My dad and I were coming back from the casino and were delighted to have such a great meal to end our day together!! Thank you for the great food Tonya!! We'll be looking forward to more soon!!"}
{"text":"Some of my best sandwiches in Europe were at gas stations. Never thought I'd have a same experience in the states but this is the place! Even better is the car wash best ever! I can even have a glass of wine! The logistics are a bit confusing at first."}
{"text":"We've been going here for 3 years. Their food is delicious. They have all kinds of knick knacks for sale. You can get your car washed while you eat or just go there to eat! That's usually what we do."}
{"text":"This is a late post. Took the family out for BBQ dinner last week Wednesday. Ordered the Smokehouse Tour with pulled pork, sliced brisket and shredded chicken. Everything was fantastic - except we couldn't find any butter or honey for the cornbread. The shredded chicken had some real wonderful flavor! The brisket was juicy and tender. It may have been a tad overdone. Was looking for the \"smoked ring\" around the brisket and didn't see it but it was still good. For $53 (Smokehouse tour and 2 small & 1 lg drink) it was something we would have paid for in a regular restaurant for the 4 of us-maybe a little more. For sides we got the beans, mayo coleslaw and shoestring fries. Didn't have very long to wait for our dinner since we got there about 5:45 - so before the dinner crowd. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My husband is from Texas and knows his BBQ. This place is one of his favorite spots in the valley. It is a little pricey but you won't be disappointed, especially the breakfast!"}
{"text":"I love the breakfast here! We always make a morning of coming here after hiking. You can't go wrong with meat and eggs... I mean seriously... life's greatest foods. It's not JUST meat though. They smoke the brisket and they have an option for wet or dry. Dry is little to no fat and wet has a lot of fat on it. My husband ate all the fat with the meat but that is not for me. The whole jiggly chewy fat (in my opinion) is to flavor the meat while it cooks and that's all. But obviously people like it - my husband included - so I can not judge. Anyways! They have bacon, sausage and pork as well! They have many bbq sauces to choose from, ranging from sweet to habanero. We took a little cup of each to try with our meal. 

The breakfast tacos are very good! Recently I had the half stack dry with potatoes instead of the hash browns because I'm allergic to cheese. But my dad and husband got the full stack how it is intended to be eaten, hash brown cakes, hollandaise, beef, and eggs. It looked very yummy and they were both raving over it. There is also a full coffee bar and bakery. The bakery includes some gluten free cookies, but not dairy free. The treats all looked really good and fresh. Cinnamon rolls, cookies, brownies, muffins... yum!

They have a little store full of cute decor and a lot of wine! There is also a wall of refrigerators full of beer. The fish tank is really cool and you can sit around it and eat. I highly recommend The Thumb for any meal! You can get the breakfast stack all day! So after you hike, you deserve a yummy meal that will fill you up. We will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"As you approach The Thumb (otherwise known as Tom's Thumb) along a bit of barren highway, there is the facade of a gas station and a carwash with a bit of retail in the back building.  Parking is plentiful and you walk across the typical gas station and then into the Restaurant/Store/Carwash.  That's where average ends and the magic bustling of the BBQ restaurant begins. Even during the middle of the week, at lunch time, there was a good sized line for ordering at the counter.  I didn't mind waiting too much as I perused the walls and saw \"Triple D\" memorabilia; a big poster signed by Guy Fieri and some cheezy T-shirts.  Whimsical, decor aligned along the walls and on post corners, kept me preoccupied while I waited to order.  The line did seem to move a bit slow, but I really didn't mind, since I was happy snapping souvenir pictures.

I found the eating areas to be a bit disjointed and scattered, but we were fortunate enough to find a table for our group of 5.  The order arrived quickly, although I was served up without any eating utensils.  I found a friendly server and she immediately provided the missing utensils with a smile and apology.

The sliced brisket sandwich that I ordered did not disappoint.  Large portions of brisket cooked just the way I like it; a little dark on the outside and moist on the inside.  Accompanied with some of the hickory BBQ sauce from the sauce counter, the sandwich was exactly what I hoped it would be.  The BBQ sauce counter offered up many varieties of sauces, of which I chose Carolina and Hickory flavors.  The Carolina sauce was a little \"watery\" to my liking.  The sandwich also came with a small sample size side of coleslaw, which was creamy with a little vinegary taste.  It was a great side dish which complemented the BBQ brisket.

I've been anxious to try The Thumb ever since I saw it on \"Triple D.\"  The show was definitely great advertisement for the restaurant, witnessed by the lunch patrons, decor and shirts.  

I'm glad I experienced it and recommend it to anyone that wants great BBQ in an out of the way place in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I had tried their tacos at a yelp event a few month ago and since I was in the area, treated a friend to lunch here. I was torn between the tacos and a sandwich, but I opted for the beef brisket sandwich with fries. They are full service on the weekend and our server was very friendly and attentive. The sandwiches come with no sauce and they have a sauce bar for you to. Everything was fresh and tasty. Weird thing - I went to pour ketchup on my fries and there apparently was water in the cap that spilled into my basket, narrowly avoiding my food. This place is near my office so I will definitely be back to try something new."}
{"text":"So when you think of lunch in a gas station, what comes to my mind are shriveled up hot dogs on rollers, thin, dry hamburgers under a heat lamp or maybe a microwave burrito, not at Tom's Thumb Gas Station.  Campfire Bistro is located inside the gas station and this place has real smoked BBQ.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was very, very good.  It wasn't the best BBQ I have ever eaten, but it was extremely good.  It was very flavorful and not dry at all.  They had a wide assortment of sauces available from North Carolina vinegars to Texas sweets to KC mustards.  I tried a Chipotle sauce...very good, some bite without a lot heat."}
{"text":"Was lucky enough to be invited to the Yelp Western Adventure last night and definitely one of the highlights was the pulled pork taco from Tom's Thumb Fresh Market. Not sure what type of tortilla/flat bread they use, but it was delicious, chewy and toasty. It held up well to all the pulled pork, spicy/tangy sauce and cabbage. Next time I'm in north Scottsdale I'll make sure to stop for a fillup for my car and for me!."}
{"text":"Update: business reached out and said that in response to the review they are now offering a discount of $2 on the cobbler if you don't get ice cream. And said they have addressed the need for consistency in the quality/size with the chef. That's all very welcome and hopefully we will see this played out on future Yelp reviews/pics.


A mashup of pricey tchotchke and a large menu of counter-ordered food. The problem?? The VERY small peach cobbler is $9.72!!! Even without ice cream (we requested no ice cream - they said same price, which would be fine if it was decent/normal size and tasted great). See pic. It's about 3\" in diameter and 1/2\" high. On top of that. It was forgettable in flavor. I don't get the disproportionate pricing. They sell other equally sized deserts that are less than half price.

Fish tank is neat though. I guess they are just trying to do too much and not doing everything well."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute treat. Amazing food and wonderful ambiance. Not to mention, you can fill up your vehicle and get it washed while you feast on amazing BBQ. This place is a must!"}
{"text":"I first saw this place featured on the show \"Tanked.\" The aquarium they had custom made, the reported award winning BBQ and my being in the area recently warranted a lunchtime visit.

It was a car wash, with a lot of cool knick knacks for sale.  But the smell of the BBQ hits you as soon as you walk in.  I ordered the half Brisket Stack and my wife got the chopped brisket sandwich.  I'm glad I got the half order because it left me just right and not too miserable from overeating.  It was well worth the visit!!  Delicious!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a rub and a pulled pork this is the place. The Campfire Bistro in the Tom Thumb Market is a hidden gem you would never think of stopping at since it is located in a car wash. The food is outstanding!
The brisket tacos are excellent and very filling. Three soft shells with 3 health cut strips of brisket each, a side of salsa and onion/tomato/lettuce makes this a yummy and filling lunch. The caprase sandwich is a lite lunch and very tasty as well. 
The bistro is very busy right at noon, best to get there a little early are a little later. Pulled pork is also popular and they have daily specials. Prices are reasonable with meals ranging from about $7-10. Highly recommended.

I've also tried the bistro for breakfast and although good, I was less impressed than I have been at lunch. I had a pulled pork and cheese omelet. The pork was dry and bland. There was little taste to the omelet, it might have been better with a salsa or sauce. Waffles are small. Breakfast potatoes are ho-hum ordinary."}
{"text":"Fun and homey.  Good food. Great gift items. A luxury convenience store. Service is sometimes inconsistent."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place as I love BBQ and it came highly recommended by a friend.  
Pros.  Pulled pork was up there with the best I've ever eaten.  The sauces and sides were amazing.  Loved the cornbread.
Cons.  Incredibly slow service.  We were told 20 minutes when we ordered.  Four of us ordered separately one after the other.  The first order came out in 35 minutes.  The fourth was 50 minutes.  They said there was some sort of mix-up but did not do anything to make it right.  The moist brisket was bad.  Chewy and almost impossible to eat.  Such a disappointment given the pork was so good.

So decent BBQ but cool environment.  You can do better."}
{"text":"The best pulled pork ever!!!  Also love their corn on n the cob. They should serve a whole cob instead of a smaller size."}
{"text":"Have I lost my mind? Did I really order a brisket salad.....in....a gas station? YES! And did it completely blow my mind? YES! The Campfire Bistro is the dining portion of Tom's Thumb Fresh Market. And it is unbelievable. You can come here for breakfast (yes, they serve brisket at 7:30 am), lunch or dinner. The old gas station had closed down and a very enterprising man opened the new and vastly improved full service gas station, food counter and gourmet market. They have fresh and delicious baked goods and a (mostly) full coffee shop. It was a real treat to come in and experience the wonder that a gas station can offer. In fact, I would say that you should come here for the food, and get your car filled up with gas while you're at it, instead of the other way around."}
{"text":"Awesome food and a great BBQ. Just heard they won Sonoran Living's best BBQ in there challenge! Way to go!"}
{"text":"What a find.  A delightful restaurant inside a car wash and the shopping is really fascinating.  Our waitress Sarah took care of our group as we figured out how to enjoy the ribs and the barbecue plate.  Be sure to try the sauces they are great."}
{"text":"Update! The breakfast tacos are LIFE!!! (Service still takes a lil while though...but it's worth it)"}
{"text":"Hopefully you have seen this place on Triple D or more recently on Tanked(fish tank show).  But let's get to the important stuff, the food?  BBQ that is wood smoked is incredible.  I ordered the 3 meat platter so I could taste a few different meats.  I had sliced brisket, pulled pork, and chicken.  It came with two sides, I ordered Mac and cheese(get ready the serving it's huge and tastes amazing) and BBQ beans(talk about super nerdy, they put brisket in their beans and it tastes awesome).  I am a huge fan and will without a doubt be back!"}
{"text":"Who came up with this idea anyway? A car wash, gas station, gift shop, bistro all in one! Unbelievable that they make all the food and pastries onsite! They have a great selection of food and drinks and the car wash is top notch. This place is a bit out of my way, but I'll be back to check out some more BBQ!"}
{"text":"Great find and fun for a family. Wait staff is attentive and nice. Good BBQ."}
{"text":"This was a neat place to eat!  I loved the gas station, car wash, boutique shop, and restaurant all combined!  They had a lot of BBQ sauces to try.  I had pulled pork BBQ tacos.  My daughter had a pulled pork sandwich.  The food was great, but the portions weren't very big.  The soda station was fun for the kids."}
{"text":"Such a funny idea for a bbq place. Happened to be  driving down Bell Road today and ran right into this GAS STATION/CAR WASH! From the outside, it looks like a convenience store but when you walk in, there's a full coffee shop and bbq restaurant with a patio!! Pretty eclectic place with a lot to look at. I chose the Pigs and Grits from the All Day item menu and it was BOMBBBBB!!! It's bbq pulled pork and bacon served over grits and everything was delicious! I tried a handful of the bbq sauces, including the mustard and chipotle ones. Sooooo good and I'll definitely trek back up there for more bbq soon!"}
{"text":"So far I have only been here for carry out, and so far so good. The food is incredible, never had to wait too long, and they have a great section of different Bbq sauces."}
{"text":"Great car wash! Food is really good inside however pretty pricey. Great place overall though."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it 3 stars for the ambiance inside the market. I may have not ordered the right thing however I got the smoked chicken salad and for $11 im expecting something good/and how can you make a salad wrong? Right? The smoked chicken was all fat and gross. I didn't even feel comfortable feeding it to my dog so it went right in the garbage!! I may have to try something else but I'm just not sure since that chicken was so bad"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here Saturday for a late lunch.  I'm a fan of Guy's and like to check out the restaurants he's featured on DDD.  The concept of this place is cool--gas station, car wash, restaurant, bakery and gift shop--one stop shopping.  The food is only OK as far as I'm concerned.

I had the turkey melt and my friend had the brisket sandwich which came with coleslaw.  My turkey melt was deli turkey--definitely NOT smoked turkey--the turkey was sliced like one would buy at the deli--nice, even slices of deli meat--not turkey that had just been smoked or even baked in the oven.  That was disappointing since we were at a bbq place and the turkey is described as being \"smoked in house\".  Maybe they take a slab of deli turkey and put it in the smoker and then slice it?

My friend's brisket sandwich was dry and she had to keep drinking water to get it down.  She didn't eat the bread, so it was just the meat.  I tasted it--yep, very dry.  I put bbq sauce on it.  Her coleslaw that came with it had absolutely NO taste.  It tasted like oil--no vinegar, no salt, no nothing--just bland.

Maybe Saturday was a bad day.  I live 30 miles away, so it was a drive....a drive that I won't make again."}
{"text":"My mom went with me to my little guy's swim class yesterday and afterwards we went to Tom's Thumb to give it another try.  Everyone was friendly and the food was much better this time around.  Actually I would say the quality of the food was the same but the portion was much better/bigger.  I look forward to going at night to try the BBQ."}
{"text":"You know, I was very close to giving this place 4 stars, only because of the unusual environment. A BBQ joint in a gas station? It's not like this is Alabama. But the food is so good, I can give no less than 5 stars. Pretty much anything you order that is BBQ is great, but my favorites are the pork ribs & the pulled pork. Tons of sauce options! It is strange to sit in a convenience store eating a $30.00 dish, but at the end of the day it's unique. And I love unique. A little too pricey, but in the end worth it. Wait staff not needed and makes me uncomfortable."}
{"text":"This place boasts some amazing BBQ!  The flavors are all there. I never think of a gas station having great food but this is my one exception. Pure greatness!  I'm glad it is so close and will b back multiple times in the coming future."}
{"text":"Well, I've been looking forward to trying this place for a while... But the excitement was short lived.

The grocery store area is very charming. The service wasn't bad, but not personable or memorable. 

We got the platter with chicken, pulled pork, and brisket with macaroni and cheese and baked beans for the sides. We also tried the crab cake salad. 

The iced tea was really tasty! They have multiple sauces so we found 2 we thought were good.

First of all, the meat platter was really small for 16 dollars. The brisket was so dry it looked beyond dead and it was chewy like it was recooked from the day before. The pork was also very dry and pretty flavorless. The chicken was surprisingly pretty decent although nothing to write home about. The crab cakes were okay, but mostly tasted like fried breadcrumbs. Salad was just a bed of spring mix with tomatoes and nothing much else to speak of.

As for the sides.... The macaroni had a good flavor but had completely separated and all the grease was laying on top.. Pretty much seemed to be microwaved from another day.  The beans were lackluster just like everything else, but also really provided no texture. 

Overall, it was a cute place with good iced tea, but my advice is try little miss BBQ instead."}
{"text":"Amazing gas station. They have a bistro and full service car wash. This bistro is the real deal! I recommend the beef brisket."}
{"text":"I came to have my car washed and had dinner while I waited. I had the pulled pork platter with BBQ beans and macaroni & cheese. There was also corn bread. All were delicious! The pulled pork was so tender and flavorful. The beans and macaroni and cheese were amazing! Corn bread was great too! And they did a great job on my car! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Overrated. I got the two meat plate (pork and brisket). The meat was average bbq but I enjoyed it. The vinegar slaw was totally flavorless and bad. Where is the vinegar??  It tasted like chopped cabbage tossed with a little oil. Not sure what the draw to this place is.  Cornbread was not that good."}
{"text":"Breakfast - Overpriced and Overcooked

I have been a long time fan of this restaurant for its BBQ so I decided to try their breakfast.  The even with a steep $9 price tag, the 100 year old sourdough starter pancakes caught my eye.  I added the bacon and two eggs scrambled.  $14.50 without tip.

After the typical Tom's Thumb wait the breakfast arrived.  I was a bit surprised.  My breakfast consisted of 2 six or seven inch pancakes, charred, 2 strips of bacon, and a mound of browned eggs.  Hoping the taste would justify the deficit in the servings appearance and portion, I dug in.  No...  The eggs were as they appeared, overcooked an rubbery.  The pancakes were ordinary and disappointing.  The bacon was however, well prepared.

Will I go back?  Yes, but I will stick with the BBQ for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"My daughter needed a car wash and we decided to make it an outing and have lunch there too. Little did I realize it would be some outing. At this point I'm torn on my rating. So I was pretty mad and pretty happy but here it goes.....

Came here to get a car wash and love it cause I can check-in and get $5 off. What a deal. I would call this place a surprise when you walk inside. Half is a dining area which really looks like a BBQ joint. Then you have the other half which is a store with drinks, beer, and other stuff. 

I ordered the brisket sandwich with fatty brisket and chopped brisket. Requested moist brisket. It also comes with a bag of chips or you can upgrade. I just got a bag of chips. My wife and daughter wanted to split a sandwich. They ordered a Turkey Melt and a bag of chips. What happens is you get a number and put it on the table and they bring your food to the table. They even told me there will be a 15-20 minute wait cause they were so busy. 

So we found an inside table. Sat down. Got our water cups and picked out our BBQ sauce. They have so many different sauces. We were so hungry we ate our bag of chips before our food came. So we waited and waited. Got so late that we thought our car would be finished. My wife saved our table while we checked on our car. We figured that the food will be there when we get back. 

Got our car back, tipped, parked our car, got back to the table and lo and behold NO FOOD. Wasn't a happy camper. Everyone around came later and got their food. We still didn't get our food. I complained to the head cashier and I guess she talked to the general manager. The head cashier apologized to us and said it was an honest mistake. The general manager also apologized too. He gave us about five baby back ribs and they were really good. Very juicy. Very tender. Really good. 

The general manager came over to see how we were doing. Apologizing again. So while he was talking to us the head cashier apologized again and gave us a $25 gift card for our troubles. She then gave us three large snicker doodles cookies. They were so moist. So good

So the kitchen was trying to get our order out and while we were still waiting the general manager made up a mini tour Platter for us. Fatty brisket, chopped brisket, beans, collared greens with sausage, and coleslaw. Everything was so good. Loved the fatty brisket. Chopped brisket was a little dry but nothing that the BBQ sauce couldn't resolve. The collared greens with sausage was so good and had a nice kick to it. My wife loved the coleslaw. The beans were pretty good too. 

So we finally got our food and took it home. Spent too much time there. We came home and the brisket sandwich was so good. Very tender. Very moist. I thought it was on Texas toast. Very good. The turkey Melt was a little cold by the time we got home. My daughter scarfed it down and had not complaints but my wife wasn't that thrilled with the sandwich. Just remember that they are know for their BBQ. Baby back ribs and brisket. 

So overall, I have mixed feelings for this place. Love the car wash. Love the BBQ. Probably some of the best on the North side of town. Food is really good. Good sides. Just didn't get my food on time but the management really stepped up and took care of us. Gift card, cookies, baby back ribs, and mini tour. Management really cares and apologized many times. So I'm willing to give them another try. Hopefully the service will be better next time."}
{"text":"I love The Thumb BBQ. Best Cuban sandwich in the area, hands-down. The flavor are overwhelming and it is for sure a shareable sandwich. It can get a little busy so be patient. Prices a little high but if you have to drive anywhere else for BBQ, you're paying that in gas.

If you haven't had a chance to stop here, DO! It's great.

Don't let a BBQ restaurant at a gas station/car wash fool you. This is the real deal.

Awesome sauces too!"}
{"text":"Visited again, the wife loved the bbq. I was less than impressed as my meat was on the dry side. Still good nonetheless. Bonus for the desserts now."}
{"text":"Well I've been here 3 times recently the last month to get a few small items and noticed my first time that customer service wasn't there specialty that's for sure. This lady Kathy at the counter never said thank you or hello or nothing. Nothing ! At least acknowledge and say thanks after buying in your store that you represent. The last time I go in there the same thing from the same lady named Kathy. Are you kidding me. Cannot stand people like that and if you are representing a store you need to be a little more courteous and at least say thank you to the customer. Ill never spend another dime in this place. Ever!"}
{"text":"Just ate here today. It was pretty good. I got the Cuban sand which. It was good. I also got the brisk it chili. It also was good. I love good bbq, and bbq at home all the time. I like trying bbq around the valley. The reason for 4 stars is I have had better and without the sauces it was rather bland. With the sauces it was really good. I'm a dry rub person, but really like good sauce..."}
{"text":"A brilliant concept! Fresh tasty food and drinks (and a yummy looking pastry bar) all while you get the best car wash of your cars life! The wait for the car wash was well worth it and I happily passed the time while having a delicious lunch (crap cakes on mixed greens) and browsing the stores cute little market section. I just moved to the neighborhood and this will be my regular spot!"}
{"text":"My boss asked me if I wanted to go to lunch one day. \"Yeah, I want to take you to this gas station. They have the best barbecue.\" I was a little skeptical about eating at a gas station, but I am certainly not going to turn down a free lunch.

Calling this place a gas station is really a misnomer. Yes, there are gas pumps and a car wash outside, but the market itself could easily function as a standalone restaurant. When was the last time you saw a chandelier in a gas station? And they serve beer and wine (and not in a brown paper bag).

On to the food...it was amazing! I got the brisket tacos and the brisket was perfectly cooked. They don't put any sauce on the meat, but they have about 6 different BBQ sauces for you to choose from, including traditional ones like Memphis style to spicy ones like  Habanero. 

They also have breakfast. The bacon waffles are pretty good and have a cinnamon taste to them, but not very bacony. The campfire wrap is essentially a giant breakfast burrito with eggs, bacon, and tons of veggies. You definitely won't be hungry the rest of the day.

If you live/work in the Scottsdale area, you definitely need to add this place to your rotation!"}
{"text":"I have such high expectations for the food here that I have tried it several time.  Never satisfied the flavoring is always over powering and not good."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to hitting this place up after seeing it on DDD....... sadly I was let down. The brisket was fatty (and not in the good way), the pulled chicken was dry, and the turkey melt was just ok.
The sauces are pretty good, the breakfast burrito was good as well. But if you're looking for BBQ, I am sorry to say that this is not the place."}
{"text":"Word's clearly gotten out about this place as it's impossible to get in and out for lunch inside of an hour.  You're usually waiting in line for a good 10 minutes, and then you're waiting another 15-20 for your food... BUT IT'S SO WORTH IT!!!!!!!  They are currently remodeling the place, so it's a little tough to get around.  I can't wait to see the final product.  Their food is so good, I can't even think of words to describe it.  The meat is expertly seasoned, smoked, and prepared.  Their menu is extensive, even featuring all day breakfast.  They offer a great selection of sauces to meet every BBQ aficionado's desires.  I was here on 10/05 with a friend from work, and the general manager spent time chatting us up about the upcoming changes.  SUPER nice guy; I was impressed at how he seemed genuinely interested in hearing what we had to say, not to mention the passion with which he talked about his business.  He even poked into the kitchen to grab me a sample of one of the meats that was being prepared.  Good BBQ can be found just about anywhere, but this stuff is exceptional."}
{"text":"Such a cool, quirky place to get gas, wash your car, eat some delicious bbq and top it off with very, very yummy homemade desserts!

Staff is fabulous, very attentive and friendly, did I mention the food is delish?  They have a good assortment of wine and beer available with a small corking fee and a cute little gift shop with real unusual and fun items.

Definitely worth a stop, and a dog friendly patio outside as well!

Didn't try breakfast but it sounded good too."}
{"text":"I'll be perfectly honest and tell you that I didn't want to like this place because of the Diners Drive in and Dives thing. Signs everywhere! That show is obnoxious. BUT the food is good. Real good. Especially after a Tom's Thumb hike. I even like the kitsch crap all over the place. Out of 6 people in our group at least 3 said they were bringing their family next time. 

I had a half order of the stack and it was annoyingly good. Why does Guy soandso have to be right? Ugh! Crisp cheesy hashbrown , melt in your mouth brisket, and perfect fried egg on top. 

This is a cute place and you can forget about roller dog hotdogs and heat lamp pizza. This BBQ is legit."}
{"text":"Definitely lives up to all the great reviews.  I wish all gas stations and truck stops could provide this kind of delicious regional cuisine, a comfortable and attractive space and a few tempting doo dads to peruse while waiting for food. 

I really thought I had perfected breakfast to the point where eating out was superfluous. Tom' s Thumb has renewed my faith in extra fluffy pancakes, super delicious breakfast tacos and other dishes.  You get the sense that the chefs really care about the food- the look
 and flavors.  

I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Much improved since the last time I visited. Haven't tried the car wash out yet but the food was good. It's a really neat concept if you haven't been there before."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the restaurant portion of Tom's...  

This was my first visit to Tom's tonight as I stopped in for carry out on my way back into town.  I ordered 3 sandwiches (pulled pork, cuban, and brisket) and some potato salad.  I asked for an upgrade to my side since I didn't want the chips that came with my meal.  The girl was confused and said she could only do it if I ordered all of my sandwiches as \"lunch combos\" and then the chips would become fries.  I agreed to the deal and asked for sweet potato fries.  I did get sticker shock when the bill came to $48 since it didn't seem like much more than a fast food operation. 

The girl helping me told me she only worked there for a week and a half.  Although she did seem nice, she needed more training.  The other two girls behind the counter seemed very occupied socializing with each other.  Maybe they could have helped double check the order and shadow the new girl a little closer.   

As I was driving home I realized I didn't receive the three drinks that should have come with the \"lunch combo\".  I was too far to return for the drinks.

When I got home and opened the fries, they were all regular and not sweet potato.

It also seemed weird that my cold, non-insulated potato salad was put in the same bag as all of my hot BBQ.  Maybe I'm just being picky but seems like common sense.  The potato salad wasn't bad but seemed to be lacking something that would make it stand out from other average potato salads.   

ALL of the meat was VERY dry.  I had to really sauce it up to get it down.  Even my kids who were starving wouldn't eat the sandwiches.  Thank god for fries even if they weren't the right ones.  It's a shame because the brisket seasoning was tasty.  

On a positive note, the sauce was very good.  I tried about 4 different kinds and they were all above average.   

I'm giving this place a 2 star rating instead of a 1 because I think there is potential to have a good meal and good service here.  Obviously they are having consistency issues or a bad weekend chef based on all the good reviews here."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and couldn't resist visiting a BBQ in the middle of car wash. In fact, the BBQ was great. There were great choices, reasonably priced, plus a wonderful set of sauces, including South Carolina's mustard-based and North Carolina's more fluid vinegar-based one. Plus aioli - how can one resist? The manager stopped by to chat about BBQ around the country. Arthur Bryant's of Kansas City came up, the Gold Standard,  but this is definitely in the same league!"}
{"text":"Good food and staff. I had the Brisket & Pulled pork with a side of Fries & fruit. Also came with some sliced pickles and texas toast. Good experience and it lived up to my friends recommendation. I'm not always on that side of town, but I could see making it a frequent place to visit as the food and BBQ sauce options were all good."}
{"text":"Was definitely disappointed by the 3 little pigs. Which I ordered because I figured I'd be able to try their pulled pork pulled chicken and beef brisket. Definitely wasn't as good as I expected, brisket was dry and their sauces weren't anything impressive. Not to mention it was pretty pricey for what you get. The place itself had a nice atmosphere though. I don't ever see myself going back...unless I need gas."}
{"text":"Food was really good. The place was nicely decorated considering it was inside a Gas Station. It has a really nice, big fish tank I ate beside too. Line was super long but they got your order out in a timely manner. 
I gave it 4 stars not because of the food but because it was overpriced considering the portion  they gave you. I came here because I saw it on a TV show but I wont be coming back. Really good though."}
{"text":"I go here frequently and always get the pulled pork platter, baked Mac and cheese, and BBQ beans....always delicious and the best dish at the Thumb....clean environment and the service is always good"}
{"text":"Love it here!  Chopped salad with smoked chicken was delicious.   Great fries and bbq..... at the car wash!!!  Love to browse the great wines and gift items too."}
{"text":"It's unusual to find good food in a gas station, but Tom Thumb has good food.

The problem is that the prices totally defeat the purpose of trying to find good food in a gas station. You may as well go eat the food at a restaurant. Great food, with corresponding prices, therefor you get what you give."}
{"text":"I initially tried this place because of the reviews and was disappointed when I did. But thankfully they have awesome management that saw my disappoint, reached out to me and made things right! And the food was actually good. My coworker is from Detroit and loved the ribs and said for sure she will be back. Totally turn around from my first experience."}
{"text":"Been hear a few times and was not overly impressed. Finally had time brisket stack and realized what I have been missing. Well done sir"}
{"text":"I would have never thought there would be any worthwhile food to be had at a gas station aside from the Oreo's.  Boy was I wrong!  This little food shop is hiding inside one and I've gone to lunch here a few times now with great results.

You'll order your food at the counter and they'll bring it to you in the dining area.  I'm a big fan of the baked macaroni and cheese and it is again what I got on my most recent trip.  Coming with a slice of Texas toast it is deliciously cheesy, I just wish they gave you more!

They also have a variety of BBQ options here, which is the real draw of the place.  I've sampled a few options such as the pulled pork and they were all quite good.  Sweet potato fries are also excellent.

Service was decent, although as with most places, Friday lunch hour will get pretty busy.  My meal came out quick, but if you're getting one of the meat options, you may be waiting a little longer while they process the rush.

I'll definitely be back for more, I'm especially interested in trying their breakfast options.  One of these days I'll have to wake up in time to do so, as it's only until 11am."}
{"text":"Super good food.  Not that friendly.  Cash register has sign \"Let's assume I'm right, it will save time\".  That kind of explains it.  But did I mention the food is great?  The best BBQ, etc you will ever find at a gas station, or anywhere."}
{"text":"Very impressed, the Stack was amazing!   Never had anything like it, the lean brisket was still moist and the crunchiness of the potato cake really made it tasty!  Their sauce was great too.  The mop sauce was my favorite, great sweetness with a little kick."}
{"text":"Awesome  & unique  place. Me and my two granddaughters spent over an hour looking at the unique gifts they have and all reasonable priced. Plus they sell wine! Yup and beer a must stop place. Oh the tarts are excellent we will try the BBQ next time when we are a the Ice Den."}

Outstanding Bar-B-Q in North Scottsdale. With a neat little Country store besides located inside a Shell Gas station. Mind you, its a bit more than Dickey's but as much as I like Dickey's I like this place a lot too. Great portions and oh-so-tasty.

Outstanding Brisket platter. . .going to try the sandwich next time I'm in, and that stack (minus cheese though).

And definitely do try the snickerdoodle cookie. Light, airy and great!
Been there three times in the past month - and will be back there this week too!"}
{"text":"This is actually coming from a guy who does not like BBQ. This place has completely defined what great BBQ is. The meats are cooked to perfection. I had the Brisket Stack. I loved the combination of egg and the perfectly textured/seasoned hash brown underneath. I also hate grits with a passion. My mother ordered the Pig and Grits. Now I love grits or at least their rendition of it! I recommend this place to anyone who is traveling to Arizona!"}
{"text":"Oh my lord, amazing BBQ! 

Just like Jeff P, I was quite surprised to find amazing food at a random gas station/convenience store/car wash. But Guy Fieri knows no wrong (for the most part). The wait is worth it if you have time, especially during the lunch rush. Both times I've been here recently, the line hadn't been terribly long, just enough to barely make a decision on what to order (both times the pulled pork and sweet potato fries). When you order, they're upfront with the wait time, and I appreciate that. 

Mostly everything BBQ-related comes plain so you can choose your BBQ sauce(s) and douse or lightly dress it to your liking. I'm a huge fan of the original, the Texas (a bit spicy), and one of the southern q's. Also major fan of using them for dipping in the sweet potato fries (both times have come out fresh from the kitchen!). I like that they give us all the BBQ options at the toppings counter and a description of each. 

Plus up for their fresh teas (that don't come out of the Coke Freestyle), and the Coke Freestyle machine that has the best crushed ice ever! 

If you have some time to kill, peruse thru the convenience store part and you're bound to find something interesting to play with or buy or both."}
{"text":"Being from Oklahoma I crave BBQ. It's one of my favorite things, yet I Have found it really hard to find good BBQ in Phoenix. When I heard about Tom thumbs market I was excited to try it hoping that my passion for pork would be met. Sadly, I had a bad experience with the food. My brisket was so dry that it was turning grey.....

I had some pulled pork as well and it was not quite as dry as the brisket but still not juicy or smokey and lacked flavor. The sauces were good, really enjoyed the Carolina sauce and they had a real good chocolate chip cookie. When it came to the sides I would recommend the cole slaw. It was a lighter vinegar based slaw with lots of flavor. 

With all the positive reviews and from what I heard from other friends it seems as though I maybe was there on a bad day. Maybe I will try again some other time down the road but for now I just couldn't recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"This is my favorite BBQ in Scottsdale!! We are barbecue snobs after growing up in Texas with excellent barbecue. It's got the smoked flavor... and it's real. Good quality products and great side dishes and cobblers. Great breakfast too. Clean and pleasant place to eat and it's fun watching the salt water fish swim there too. It's a beautiful place ... thumbs up for The Thumb!!"}
{"text":"That was a straight up bomb brisket sandwich! Had a nice mellow smokey flavor, nice bark and was moist, this place knows what to do with brisket, will be back Fo sure!"}
{"text":"Today I had one of the best experiences I've ever had at a restaurant while with my family.  I have been going to the thumb for a long time. It is my favorite place to get bbq in the valley.  There is no doubt that in our commercially driven community that this is a true gem.  Back to today though, it was extra special.  I was there with my 1 and 4 year old nieces, and not only did they enjoy their chicken tenders, but they got to enjoy the fish tank to in a very special way (got to see how the fish got fed by a member of The Thumbs team).  The food was excellent as always, and we brought all the leftovers home!  I'll be back soon for bbq!"}
{"text":"Seriously thee best chicken breast salad.  Fresh delicious mixed greens & tender perfectly cooked chicken breast.  It's strange to find a great restaurant inside of a car station/car wash, but it quite a pleasant surprise!  Hubby LOVES the ribs & scrumptious selections of BBQ sauces."}
{"text":"I eat here as much a possible due to the amazing bbq.  Everything from the catfish to the pulled pork is amazing and I have never had a bad meal here.  A little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Dependable neighborhood BBQ.  Great for quick takeout."}
{"text":"Love this unique place.  Who would think that while you fill up your gas tank, obtain a fine car wash, you can also get some fine artisan food and BBQ inside, as well a coffee house, sit-down dining, and additional room for browsing fine Arizona spices, sauces, and, crafts.  My wife and I love stopping by for all of the above.  Great place to take friends from out of town to visit.  The food has always been excellent"}
{"text":"Chopped Brisket is awesome! Slap it on a Tortilla with their Hickory BBQ sauce and there you go! The pulled pork is average and the baked mac and cheese is not very cheesy. The baked beans and smoked brisket are very good as well. The ambiance is a cross between hipster, cracker barrel and QT. Yes, I just crossed those three things. I had my car wash there and they did an excellent job, inside and out."}
{"text":"Hands Down Tom Thumbs has the best Car wash in North Scottsdale, they offer amazing food for Breakfast, lunch and dinner. Great place to get desert as well with it's own full-time desert chef and chef cooks.

Tom Thumbs was also feature on Food Network Channel Diners- Drive-in Dives which feature the BEST FOOD in the valley.

For all those who needs the High Octane gas this north side of Scottsdale.

Anyone needs gifts cards, and Great Beers and many stationary items best place in town is Tom Thumb.

They have the Best Staff and car washer in town very friendly and professional.

{"text":"Don't miss this spot. It was well worth the drive from the west side of Phoenix.
Wandering around, trying to figure out how the place works, I was approached by an employee who was so thoughtful and helpful. Based on some of his suggestions we ordered a sampler and it was fantastic. The brisket is a Do Not Miss. We were able to thank him when he stopped by our table --- over and above attention to detail and customer service.
There are seven or eight sauces arrayed on the tables.
Speaking of details.... If you love cars it's also worth checking out what's happening in the bay out back. While we were there final polishing was in process on a Roush Mustang. Dinner with a view."}
{"text":"I tried the brisket, tacos, ribs, grits, mexicorn, pulled chicken.  Now eveyrhing was great. My favorite things out of all of it was the grits and mexicorn. For me it was satisfying. The grits was rich and savory. The mexicorn was fun and flavorful. Service was great. The frontline was happy and attentive. Highly recommend this is place even though it's a gas station!!! LOL!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Fast, friendly and efficient service. Had the pulled pork with scrambled eggs, grits and toast. The food was hot, fresh and delicious!
The store sells an array of items from birthday cards to memorabilia, to espresso and baked goods. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The carwash is one of the best around! They're very detail oriented and do a great job. I've paid more for upgrades at other car washes and they don't do near as good a job. They have a little bit of a wait but it's worth it. Plus you can shop around their cute market or get coffee or awesome food/BBQ at the restaurant while you wait"}
{"text":"This was my third time at the Thumb and every time I love it!! Mmmmmm.... I have to say that this place is amazingly friendly too... we got there at 758 and they closed at 8. The staff was just as friendly to us at 758 as if we were their first customers...and one of the ladies even remembered me as \"the traveler from CA!\""}
{"text":"I did not expect it to be this awesome! When someone told be it was inside a gas station, I was a little reluctant, but once I got there it was awesome, they have a nice farmhouse modern theme, the food is all prepared fresh and it is very good for the prices they charge! It is a great place to stop after a soccer game!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite BBQ places. Tried the 3 meat sampler with brisket, pulled pork and hot links. The brisket was cooked to perfection. The links were full of flavor and not too spicy. Perfect for a spice wimp like me. The pulled pork was just OK. The kicker was the BBQ beans. Knock your socks off flavor. A piece of corn bread and a bowl of beans will get you through the day. Be sure to try them regardless of the protein you choose."}
{"text":"We order lunch for our staff several times a month and everyone e raves about the BBQ but my go to favorite for lunch is the Capresse sandwich- so fresh!!!  Out of towners live this place, love the concept, quality and vibe.  Mike and his staff do a great job ensuring a great customer experience."}
{"text":"I always like trying BBQ joints to see how they match up. It's hard to be beat good barbecue. They do have good bbq.  They also have other things, like burgers, but bbq is the main star here. They also have a car wash in a gas station as well as a convenience store that reminds me of an Old Country Store. Good selection of beer and wine by the way.

 I ordered a brisket salad and Cuban sandwich which is made with their pulled pork. The brisket was very good but the rest of the salad I thought was a little bland despite generous amounts of blue cheese crumbles. The Cuban sandwich was pretty good but I think that the name is misleading because it's not really like an authentic Cuban sandwich. I was kind of surprised on how small it was to be honest. Instead of serving it on toasted bread it is served on a very soft roll. The sandwich was still pretty good because of the great pulled pork but it really didn't taste like a Cuban sandwich. 

Overall worth checking out if you like barbecue."}
{"text":"Went back to Tom's Thumb to try it again.  Food was prepared much better, and staff actually seemed to care about doing a good job this time around.  I ordered the \"brisket stack\" again, but this time with lean brisket."}
{"text":"I saw your restaurant on diners.drive n and diners...congrats....im heading your way soon."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a hike and the food was amazing. Fresh and delicious with many innovative options, I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"The food here is so good! The brisket is delicious and they have good sides too like fries and Mexican corn that you don't often see at a bbq restaurant. The inside it super cute and you almost forget you are at a gas station/car wash!"}
{"text":"First of all being from TX I know what good BBQ is.  We were extremely disappointed to hear they were out of all meats by 6:30 on. a Friday night.  I could understand if it was busy but there were plenty of open tables."}
{"text":"I've only eaten a few things here, most I can't remember so they must not have been too good. What I did have here that was pretty good was their breakfast which consisted of bacon, eggs and pancake. I'm a pancake aficionado and this place passes the test! A [surprisingly] big disappointment was their coffee - it's flavorless yet bitter. With all the great coffee roasters in town you'd think they would do better."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I am born and raised in Texas so I have very high expectations of BBQ. These expectations have not been met anywhere in Arizona until I tried Tom's Thumb. This is a great little spot inside of the car wash. 

I did have one bad experience where the plastic wrap that they keep the meat in was actually INSIDE of my pulled pork sandwich. This was very disturbing to me and left a bad taste in my mouth. I was even more surprised that they did not do anything for me in this situation. This could have been a serious choking hazard and made someone sick if not kill them. 

Never the less, the food is usually always great and they just had one mess up. I won't hold that against them forever because mistakes happen. 

If you want some good BBQ this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Very fun place......dine, shop and get your car washed all in one place!  The BEST brisket since my last visit to Texas!  Check it out.....fun and definitely!!"}
{"text":"Funny story. 

I was trying to find an actual fresh market and went to this place for the reviews. Well to my surprise it's an all meat and potatoes kind of place. My mom loved it. The smells in this place alone get you hooked but the people and the funny shirts \"I like pig butts and I can not lie\" made this place all the more memorable. 

I had the catfish sandwich. It was ok the sauce was great but the fish was soggy.  (Aka why the 4 stars)

My mother had the pulled pork sandwich. She gave it a  and wants to go back again just for that sandwich. 

Great view of the mountains."}
{"text":"I would like to sublet a plot of land on Tom's Thumb. 

The availability of things inside this CAR WASH is so expansive, yet specific, that I'm almost certain I just made it up. 

Exceptional pulled pork, sleek leather purses that convert into backpacks, southern biscuits and grits, southwestern themed wine corkscrews, Quest bars, half a dozen kinds of BBQ sauce, old fashioned doughnuts... Everything one would see in a bizarre dream? Nope, just everything I bought. 

If that's not everything on your list, there's also an impressive cat paraphernalia department, as well as imported soaps, and summer campy throwback ice cream novelties. 

If you're just looking to go out to eat... at a car wash... that's also a nice restaurant with a patio.... and a coffee bar... and a bakery, then boy, is this the spot for you!

At lunch, go for the pulled pork sandwich. The classic hickory BBQ sauce leaves nothing to be desired. Put the mayo-less cole slaw on top. Skip the brisket, which is drier and tougher, and don't order a side of fruit unless you want just pineapple and apple. 

Breakfast is down home phenomenal - the pig 'n' grits offers you not one, but two kinds of frighteningly delicious pig items - bacon and crispy pulled pork atop creamy grits. Covered in cheddar cheese. Add an egg. You are welcome. The biscuits are scone-y and delightful, and the coffee is great (but for all y'all frappé wimps, rather intense.) 

Tl;dr - Tom's Thumb is le shiznit. Get anything pulled pork. Bummer that it's so conceptually redonkulous it probably doesn't exist, save for in my head... great idea, though, right?"}
{"text":"Don't be in a hurry!!  They are really slow.   Aren't in mid-afternoon and they said it would take at least half hour for sandwich.  Workers standing around while we waited to pay for packaged sandwich.   Turkey was good, but ham was fair at best.  Condiments were partially empty, and couldn't get employee to help.  Poor service!!"}
{"text":"Four stars for America! this is american as it gets. Roll in, Gas Up, buy a car wash, sit down and eat dinner, grab some misc snacks and items, all in a gas station. 

Who'dve thought? BBQ in a Gas station? This is a big win for FREEDOM! Would you like gas, a car wash, or some BBQ ribs with that? Heck yeah! Then im back to fire up my oversized lifted flatbed truck and get on with tailgating the little eco cars ..."}
{"text":"Cuban sandwich omg and from a gas station! This is NOT your normal station - the food is out of this world!! So happy we live down the street I get everything here. Gifts, car washes, lunch, and even vino. What a selection!"}
{"text":"The brisket sandwich is amazing, and the house sauce is some of the tastiest I've ever had."}
{"text":"First class carwash and excellent lunch. Management seems to know the secret formula to keep people happy."}
{"text":"Super cool gas station that you wouldn't know is a world-class number one Bbq stop. They don't have wings or mac & cheese which was sad because I am Southern and wanted that from the barbecue place. They have tons of cool knickknacks, toys and great beer selection and great iced coffee ! From what I saw they seem to have a pretty decent car wash and pretty economic price."}
{"text":"Good BBQ and a fun location. Be prepared to wait in line to order if you're coming at a normal meal time. Something they have that some fellow Canadians may appreciate is Kraft Mac n Cheese! (They also do homemade macaroni and cheese). Deducting a star b/c it's real good but not like... OMG good. It's 4 star good."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a car wash and decided to pick up a late lunch to take home. I ended up getting the brisket and pulled pork sandwiches. Both are delish! I highly recommend stopping in for a car wash and getting lunch or breakfast. They also have great peanut butter cookies."}
{"text":"A gas station with a restaurant or a restaurant that happens to have some gas pumps? 

Super impressed by their pull pork and massive amounts of barbecue sauce options from hickory to North Carolina (vinegar based). 

In addition to a bakery and grill, you can also find cute niknaks and stationary. If there was ever a North Scottsdale gas station, this is it!"}
{"text":"Holy cow.  Literally.  This is some of the best brisket I have ever had.  Melts in your mouth, which if you know about BBQing, this is hard to do with brikset.  Also had some pulled pork that was delicious.  I think it was called the platter?  Something like that.  Allows you to try both meats.  If you don't mind the ambience of a carwash, this place has some great food."}
{"text":"This review is for the food only. I have never washed my car here or even filed up with gas at this location. I'm talking about the bbq which is easily some of the best in town. The brisket and ribs are amazingly well done and they have a lot of very tempting sauces to choose from. We've only had breakfast here once but it was pretty great as well. This is easily my favorite bbq joint in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"I have returned many times and given this place more chances. I still find it to be overrated and overpriced. It is a really fun convenient store with the largest selection anywhere of drinks. It's also fun to browse the trinkets while you wait. I'm still just not impressed with the food and wouldn't go
out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. It's at a gas station so I didn't have very high expectations. I was way off. The food is amazing."}
{"text":"Ddd came here and featured the pig n grits which I ordered. The pulled pork was slightly spicy, a nice touch. I ordered 2 over easy eggs on top of it. The grits weren't the best but they were creamy. 
  BUT my husband ordered the fatty brisket sandwich! Now that's what you should order. I was so jealous. Luckily he shared his with me. You first taste the smokiness then the juicy perfectly cooked brisket.  I'm telling you it was so tasty. Every bite I took I couldn't believe how good it was. They serve it on buttered toast with strips of onions and pickles. The combination is a hit!!  They offer a bunch off different sauces but even my sauce loving husband didn't use any. 
  The beans were one of the best I've ever had. The flavor was perfect and had chunks of meat in it. Can't get better than that.
  Eat here and get the brisket!!!! I'm from Los Angeles so sadly probably will not eat here for a very long time."}
{"text":"It's a cute concept.  A car wash/gas station/convenience store/gift shop/BBQ joint.

We went for the BBQ.  It was OK-really not bad at all.  I had the brisket with cole slaw and sweet potato fries.
My friends had the ribs, and the brisket.
However,
Portions were uneven, some of the sides were cold, the brisket was a bit tough, and they were seriously chintzy on the pickles and onions that go with the meal.

To top everything off, I was the only one in my group that added a tip to my pre-pay, and I was completely forgotten.  My friends were well into their plates, and I was sitting there staring at the ceiling.  They never did remember my food, I had to tell them.

For dessert, they have the most GORGEOUS cupcakes you've ever seen,  They have glitter, and are seriously just beautiful.  We tried the boston cream, the double chocolate and the red velvet.  The boston cream was OK--the other two were TERRIBLE.  Without a doubt the most terrible tasting cupcake or cake-type ever!

I went home and ate again."}
{"text":"Terrific barbecue, outstanding fries, great bread. All around amazing food in a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"There isn't't much that Tom's Thumb doesn't have except for  rock @ roll music.  When we walked in Credence was playing with John Fogerty in the lead.  Loved that for sure! We ordered the brisket sandwich from Carly and a bag of chips.  Sure wish she told me we could add fries for a nominal amount. Anyway the brisket and BBQ sauce were not unlike what I get in Austin, TX After lunch we took a look at the wines, bears cute gift shop. For sure I will visit Tom's Thumb in the near future. I have some shopping and eating to do!"}
{"text":"cool place! it's a gas station/gift shop/restaurant/car wash/bakery! crazy! 

Don't be fooled by all the rich people fancy crap everywhere. It is upscale and over priced for just about everything.  It has a bakery with fresh coffee and small baked goods! met with my wife here, we grubbed the pulled pork sandwiches. was not impressed at all. They must of been having a bad day or somthin cause from all the good reviews you would think this place is spot on with all things cause how expensive everything is. there were hard bits and chunks in our sandwiches and it just wasn't very tasty, meat was over cooked and really chewy. They have better pulled pork at honey bear, sadly. I'm sure the other food is great, but if you can't master pulled pork at a BBQ place, something I'd definitely wrong. I'll come try it out another time just to be sure."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The food is generally consistent. I love the pork barbecue. The baked mac and cheese is delicious. The atmosphere is welcoming. There is outdoor dining available. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"didn't actually eat there, but wished we had!  We had a groupon to  a restaurant in the next area across the street.  We heard about this place from DDD/guy fieri.  So we went in to take a look at the gift shop and items in the restaurant area.  Prices were good, bakery products looked very nice and the coffee smelled fantastic!  If we didn't have the expiring groupon to the mediocre place-we would have enjoyed eating here.  The gift store had some very unique items that we're going to go back and pick up for the grandkids and this time have breakfast THERE!"}
{"text":"I have never been a fan of BBQ sandwiches and have always leaned more towards BBQ platters. Trust me on this one, go for the platter. While my husbands brisket sandwich was delicious, my 2 meat platter with brisket and pulled pork stole the show. Both meats and my chosen sides were executed perfectly. 

We loved their list of choices for sides (I recommend mexican corn and sweet potato fries) and also all of their sauces. 

My husband is from Kansas City and is very particular about his BBQ and Tom's Thumb didn't disappoint- we will be back! 

Also, the atmosphere is casual and comfy but still nice, don't be put off by the fact that it's in a gas station (this is North Scottsdale and the fanciest gas station I've ever been in - almost felt boutique-ish)."}
{"text":"Tom's Thumb has decent bbq and other menu options. The restaurant is housed in a gas station, which is odd but not overly distracting. I like their fries (both shoestring and sweet potato) and the aioli sauce is tasty. Take a minute to check out the store area. It's full of interesting gifts and specialty food and wine."}
{"text":"Delish BBQ!

Got to try their catering at a recent event. 
Brisket was fabulous. Smoky with great favor. Coleslaw is not mayonnaise based...more of a vinegar dressing with tri-colored peppers. The mac-n-cheese was a bit bland but the cobbler......YUM! Both the peach and apple were delicious!!!!

I heard it's a cool gas station, car wash a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Good food and lots to look at. The new fish tank is great. Had the brisket and pulled chicken plate with slaw and collard greens. Several sauces to choose from."}
{"text":"Have been here three times, twice for lunch and once for dinner.  Had a great experience all around. The BBQ is fabulous (6 sauces to choose from) and the pulled pork just melts in your mouth!  The 3 tacos selection is  great as well.  Service is top notch.  This is a great local go-to place and is on the top of my and my husband's list.  Go for the food!"}
{"text":"Cool little gas station with a barbecue restaurant inside. Food is actually quite good. Their gas is overpriced though but they do also offer race fuel which is nice to find."}
{"text":"We order the 3 meat platter to share. Meat was very tender but everything was cold. The only thing warm was the BBQ beans and the Mac n cheese. Don't know if I will give it another try."}
{"text":"Awesome food at a gas station? Absolutely! Toms Thumb has never disappointed, the food is amazing!  Love the pulled pork, chopped salad, BBQ tacos, chili, and pigs n grits. Great kids menu too! Staff very friendly and attentive. No surprise DD&D made a visit recently. Very cute decor inside and a nice patio outside. So lucky to have this yummy neighborhood establishment close by!"}
{"text":"Cool place. Great atmosphere. Excellent \"grocery\" selection. They stock a lot of local items like pickles from that pickling guy at the farmers markets. Queen Creek Olive company items. I didn't think anything from the market was overpriced. The produce selection seemed quite reasonable. And the beer selection was great. I tried the BBQ as well, and I thought it was pretty damn good. I got the BBQ tacos not knowing what to expect but bbq + taco = awesome! What is nice about the bbq is that it is not swimming in sauce already. You choose your sauce and slather it on appropriately. I thought the bbq was a tad expensive but that is because my view is anchored to a little bbq shack in the middle of georgia where a sandwich would be 4. Drop that shack in N Scottsdale and I understand a 8 price. The 3 tacos were $10 and I'm full from eating 3/4 of it. So, figure 3.33 a taco, that is pretty reasonable considering the quality. And looking at other bbq joints around here, the price is comparable. Add the atmosphere, awesome sauces (low country may go down as my favorite), and great staff I think they have a winning combo. The hard part will be getting customers to that location. Its convenient from the 101 but not many folks travel on Bell Rd. I hope they kick ass."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was okay. Lunch with a side = $16 per person.
Gave this place an extra star on the review edit because the manager reached out."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Heard great reviews from friends so we went despite  reading some of the Yelp reviewers that weren't pleased. My husband and I split the 1/2 rack of ribs. Very small portion and nothing to rave about. Bryan's BBQ is much better.  We also split the truffle Mac and cheese which came out in an iron skillet whick you would expect to be steaming hot and it was just warm and very bland. The baked beans came out of a can!  The women's room was being cleaned during the height  of the dinner hour and they wouldn't let you in even to wash your hands and no extra napkins were given or wet naps. Definitely not worth the trip."}
{"text":"Truck stop, Scottsdale style!  This place is a gem. The BBQ bistro inside is just a great find I feel like I shouldn't promote this place or I won't be able to get a table when I go back. I had the ribs, and they don't prepare many each day, but boy were they great. Meaty, juicy, perfect! Only thing missing was a BBQ sauce I would have liked. They have a selection of four and I'm sure most folks will find one they like, but I was hoping for a bourbon based dark sauce and the closest was a too-think smoky tomato sauce. Still, it didn't overpower the ribs and , frankly, I couldn't finish the half rack I got. Coleslaw was a bit uninteresting but a good pairing. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"We spent a few days near TPC Scottsdale and couldn't resist the fact that Thumb BBQ was just down the street.  The brisket stack and pig over grits make for awesome brunch fare. For lighter brunch fare, the fresh baked coffee cake and espresso drinks were yummy too.  Can you tell I missed the lunch & dinner lines and enjoyed the smell of BBQ smoke in the morning?  There is nothing like the sight and smell of smoked pork shoulders in the morning, finished with fresh baked coffee cake to get me on my way.  Thank you to the pit master and Susan the Baker for some great eats!"}
{"text":"What I love: their bakery (awesome gluten-free muffins & chocolate chunk cookies in addition to other baked goodies); their funky, Americana decor & gift shop; outdoor patio seating; full-service car wash. 

The location is convenient for my family so we've eaten here A LOT. Everyone seems to rave about the food but I haven't found any main dish that is crave-worthy. The smoked chicken sandwich is pretty good, as is the sausage with peppers, and the chicken salad sandwich. Shoestring fries are good and crispy, as are the BBQ beans and ranch dressing. Lots of barbecue sauces to choose from. Beers and wine available. 

Kitschy decor and shop (I almost always buying some little trinket!) and convenience keeps me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  The best BBQ in town and we moved from NC!!  The customer service is fantastic and second to none!!"}
{"text":"Wow, the place is amazing in many ways. First of all the gift shop is incredible. Secondly the bakery items are yummy. Most of all the food was delicious and I can recommend it to kids young and old like me, I'm 61 years old!"}
{"text":"Straight from the plane we made a beeline to this place. Not to be disappointed we arrived at lunch and ordered the D,D,D, recommendations. It was delicious and satisfying. Get them!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Great atmosphere.  Highly recommend this restaurant. Very tender brisket and pulled pork.  Saw this restaurant on DDD, would definitely go back and probably will."}
{"text":"I love this place. My business is 10 minutes away and I come for breakfast 3 days per week. I'm never disappointed. In fact, it's always great. The grits are simply the best. The fruit in the fruit cup is always ripe and fresh, not just cut up fruit. The sourdough pancakes are perfectly light in texture, moist and delicious. The eggs when ordered over medium, come over medium. 
Service is A1. They do get very crowded, but they are efficient.  Employees are positive, friendly and good workers.
The atmosphere is soothing and relaxing. 
Great, freshly brewed tea with agave. 
This place is worth trying."}
{"text":"At first I LOVED this location... the food was awesome & I've been there a dozen times in just a few weeks since I discovered it but today's experience grabbing lunch irritated me enough that I may not go back.  Two weeks ago when they misplaced my order and I had to wait a while I wrote it off as just a one time accident, but it happened again today.  First let me say that I served for 5 years, I still work in the food industry today in a different capacity, but I know the difference between a good server who's just swamped and needs to be cut a break and somebody who does not know how to do their job.  In any food industry the ticket time is the most important things you put the orders in and you fill the orders based on the order in which they were put in your system.  We ordered our food at 1 p.m. there was a huge group of people behind us and as we Sat at the front counter watching them fill orders wondered why 40 minutes later passes & we still don't have our take out order.  Everybody behind us in line that ordered way later than we had, already had their food in front of them and were almost finished eating... We notice that they ordered similar items to what was on our order.  In the 40+ minutes we were standing there waiting for our to-go order (which consisted of three sandwiches and two bowls of chili), we watched the expeditor pull out food from to-go containers and put them on plates to ship them out to the floor... so I'm pretty sure that they had our order ready when we first put it in and she ended up filling other people's orders with our food.  When we brought it to their attention that our order still hadn't been filled, the expdeitor gave us a look and a snippy reply that it was the second ticket up and it would probably be another 10 more minutes, no apology and she came back so quick with that response I know she didn't even look for our tickets because another lady came up right behind us asking the same question about where her food was and they gave the exact same canned response to her.  There was a really nice young gentleman there and he was very nice to us but when he told me it was going to be an additional 15 minutes in order for them to get one more bowl of chili ... I had to ask them to just credit me back the Chili as I didn't want to wait another 15 minutes on top of the 40 plus we had already waited. (I have receipt proof... initial charge time & credit time).  The lady who originally took our order was very nice and she took the issue to her supervisor to start the credit. The supervisor issued the credit back to my card, did not apologize for the delay or the fact that they probably lost our ticket in general, she said nothing to acknowledge that they had any fault in the matter at all, didnt look at the order time stamp, etc.  After I signed the new copy of my receipt, less the bowl of chili, the only thing the supervisor said to me was \"do you want my card\" to which I replied \"no I don't\". If you know that your staff has missed a ticket and its at 40 + minutes not being filled with food that doesn't even have to be cooked from scratch because its barbecue and you're not even going to offer an apology to the customer that has been sitting there watching you fill everybody else's orders ahead of yours.... SUPER irritating!  Ruined my whole Friday."}
{"text":"Our second visit while vacationing in the area, and we never want to miss this place.  From the delicioius bakery items at the cash register to some of the most unique and different gifts I have ever seen, this place really fills all of your senses, from the smell of the barbecue to the taste of the pastries, and the look of all of these enticing works of art on display for sale!  On top of all that, the car wash is tops in the area, so come for the wash, plan to eat, and bring lots of cash because you won't be able to resist the treats for sale!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend told me we should try this place because of the Yelp reviews - I was thinking she was nuts no way am I ever going to eat at a car wash. This place is unbelievable - great! We got there after 5 so it was sit down dinner only and they had the best service, great food, interesting decor and clean. Definitely well deserved 5 stars - must see to believe."}
{"text":"Can't beat the service, friendliness and food at The Thumb. Even got my car hand washed while I waited. A must eat/visit in the VOS."}
{"text":"I went into The Thumb last week with my family, really looking forward to the delicious bbq they are widely known for. However, upon getting our drinks at the fountain, my sister seemed to be in the way of one of the Thumb employees with dark brown hair, glasses and a very professional looking nose ring. The worker was carrying an ice tray commented under her breath \"Move, Brat,\" in a tone obviously loud enough given a fellow employee standing next to her felt the need to call her out and tell her she shouldn't talk to costumers like such. I was gravely disappointed given she did not even proceed to saying or showing the slightest bit of apology. Instead, the girl scoffed to her coworker and replied \"Whatever.\" We have always been pleased with the food and the ambiance of The Thumb, and it is very sad to think that we will not be visiting there again for awhile now. \"Thumbs\" up on costumer service."}
{"text":"This is the most bizarrely great place!   I stopped for a car wash, but then walked into a wine store, gourmet BBQ Cafe and vintage shopping store.   The food is really good, the atmosphere is relaxing and homey.   Not sure I'll ever get my car washed at a mainstream wash again!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great neighborhood spot for breakfast and lunch! Simple and super fresh menu."}
{"text":"Cute concept and food was good but not spectacular. I got the 2 meat platter with pulled pork and sliced brisket with 2 sides - mexicorn and macaroni and cheese. The meat could have been more flavorful, juicy, and tender. The sides were ok but again not amazing. The macaroni and cheese came in a skillet but was a little runny, and the mexicorn wasn't super flavorful. Overall, I'm not sure I need to return but it's a cool place to checkout with the attached bakery and car wash."}
{"text":"A very unique place. I had tried their yummy BBQ at the Elite yearly event at Ft. McDowell and I heard other Elites raving about the newer event they sponsored there in September 2013. So when on the way to Westworld and I noticed I needed gas, coincidentally this is the place we ended up. 

The place is a boutique, coffee bar, restaurant, convenient store, and gas station all in one. Sounds strange huh? It is, but wonderful. Got gas on the way to Westworld last night and then tried to stop on the way back for eats and browsing but they were already closed.

The staff let us in anyway to use the bathroom even though they were closed. We were very grateful for that. It was a long drive home. lol-- On the way out the door we were delighted to chat for a few minutes with some of the staff and they were beyond gracious and wonderful. The items I saw were darling and the coffee bar items looked fantastic. 

Thank you for your kind help Tom Thumb. How about a store on the west side?"}
{"text":"Best barbecue place in Arizona.. Great portions, amazing sides & the selection is also fantastic. The atmosphere is mellow, service is quick, the cashiers are very friendly too!"}
{"text":"It's a gas station, grocery store, craft store, bakery which has a BBQ Restaurant also.

The BBQ Restaurant is top notch with an array of bbq sauces. I liked the hickory flavor.

We ordered the half rack of St Louis Ribs with Mac and Cheese with French Fries. Also shared the BBQ Platter with Brisket answer Pulled Pork and BBQ Beans and Potato Salad.

The St Louis Ribs were the best item we ordered, the meat fell off the bones but were small portions (4 ribs). Great tender meat well marinated. Did not need any bbq sauce it was tasty by itself.

The Pulled Pork was also very good and tender, was good with the hickory sauce and Texas Toast.

The brisket was the least best of the meat, a little on the dry side for me.

Very much liked the mac and cheese, the beans and Potato Salad were Ok to good. The French Fries were prepared - crispy but not over cooked.

Was like the bbq store of le grande orangey with a gas station :)

Was very good and will come back again."}
{"text":"This is truly one interesting store/carwash/restaurant. s, I said STORE, CAR WASH and Restaurant.   I stopped in here to have breakfast with a group of Yelpers after an early morning hike in the Sonoran Preserve. 

I wanted to like this place, but the servers were really awful.  I ordered a cup of coffee that never came.  So I went to the counter and bought myself a self serve cup of coffee.  The server still tried to charge me for my coffee as if she brought the coffee.  No way.  

The saving grace was that amazing breakfast!  OH man, bring out the fork and the spoon because it is time to EAT!  I had their Pulled Pork and Eggs over medium with cheese grits and it was all topped with jalapeno bacon!.  An amazingly delicious pulled pork that was tender and flavorful.  The spicy bacon was also a bonus touch to the meal.  To my surprise, even the cheese grits were cooked the way that I like them!  I grabbed a few of their BBQ sauces for dipping and enjoyed all of the sauces that I tried.  I could have licked my plate clean the food was so amazing.  

It didn't occur to me when I arrived that I should have dropped my car off to be washed.  I will have to do that the next time.

I would not recommend this place for a group meetup.  there were about 15 of us and there wasn't enough room AND the service was rather poor. 

My return factor is about 45%."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Tom's Thumb Fresh Market re-washed my vehicle with the same service I had used before (The Thumb), and my car came out looking better than it has in over half a decade! Shining tires, no perceivable dust or grime in the interior and they even cleaned off under the steering column and the little cup holders. A really fantastic service, well-worth the price. This time in, I wasn't able to enjoy their restaurant fare, as that section was closed due to some exciting new additions being added (like a full bar). I did get a really nice iced americano from the coffee bar & bakery which tasted a lot better than the Starbucks version and for a better price! Definitely worth the five-star rating now for the food, as well as the wash."}
