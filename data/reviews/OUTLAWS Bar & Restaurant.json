{"text":"I didn't see the buffalo abuse mentioned in the other review, but that's certainly cause for calling this place out. My experience/review has to do with the bar service/servers. The two young women working the bars when I was there provided horrible service. I stood at first one bar, then the other, for a extremely long time being completely ignored. The \"bartenders\" served men who came up to the bar after me while I continued to be ignored...even after I spoke up. I guess they figured they'd get a better tip from the men. When one bartender finally answered when I called out, she served me a thimble-sized amount of liquor for $7. Even the guy next to me commented on that ridiculous drink. When I complained, she said \"Ok I'll top it off.\" I got a small additional amount. The others in the group of women I was with experienced the same thing, so they were deliberately ignoring them too. Kind of a self fulfilling prophecy -- when you provide poor service to anyone, you aren't going to get a good tip. We're locals, so we would have been regular, generous-tipping customers had we been treated better."}
{"text":"DESERVES A NEGATIVE !  Such a sad bar this has gone to.  I come around during \"season\" every year. Use to frequent buffalo chip but came across this bar last year as it was called \"Outlaw Annies.\" We went up to the roof top where we were greeted by a friendly gal named Maggie. She was slammed with business but wasn't long until we saw why! She greeted us, took my order along with multiple others, and came back promptly with our drinks. We had planned on a quick drink or two but ended up staying all day & coming back! Found out the rooftop was her little bar called \"Maggie's Sky Bar\" and it was well deserved! She was personable and you could tell she loved that bar and her job. Which is always a good site to see in any worker. She kicked ass!  However back to the present day.  We came back to see Maggie and how the bar was doing - saw it was changed to \"Outlaws\". We stopped in anyway.  It was sad to see Maggie's sky Bar closed...  the two bartenders downstairs were HORRIBLE. With social skills and bartending skills. Seemed like they could care less about their job - but with a manager like this place has, I believe his name was Matt?, I can see why the staff is this bad. Horrible staff, horrible management, all around horrible atmosphere.  I will not be visiting this place again unless I hear the old bartenders are back. I don't see this bar staying open. I will take my business elsewhere in Cave Creek.  If anyone knows where Maggie, April, or Jess are working - give me a shout please!"}
{"text":"Literally sitting in the parking lot writing this reviews. What a freaking joke this place is. Waited almost 3 hours for food that never came. The manager didn't even know how to handle the situation. If an establishment has a problem adding an item to an order that causes a 90 minutes delay there is a serious problem. Our waiter couldn't even take the order. He had to come back 3 times to confirm and we still didn't get our food. When we asked for the manager he was unapologetic and argued with us and said he had never seen so many unhappy people. He accused us of ordering than everyone of is changing our orders and that's why we didn't get our food on time.  Maybe next time we see a place that has no cars in the parking lot while every other restaurant is full we should take that as a sign. We came here for a bachelorette/bacherlor vacation. If you can't accommodate a party of 16 how are you even in business. We literally sat here for 3 hours and some people hadn't even received their drinks when we left. Then the manager has the audacity that say everything is our fault because we are unhappy? No duh we're unhappy we waited 3 hours for food and drinks"}
{"text":"I recently visited Outlaws for the first time and had a great time. The live band was playing a wide variety of music all night. The Bartender Phil did a fantastic job and made sure our drinks were never empty. The manager Matt was very friendly and came by to check on us a few times during our visit. Overall great experience and will definitely be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely appalled at the treatment of their buffalo. There is a fine line between rodeo tricks and flat out abuse. My idea of entertainment isn't watching an animal forced into flame while it's fur is catching fire. Gross ! If I could rate zero stars I would."}
{"text":"So this place is a bar with a microwave. DO NOT order food here. We came early during bike week and they were so understaffed. A lot of the waitresses were drunk and 90% naked before we even got our drink orders in. The live band is the only thing they get a star for. The food was cold, when it was sent back they put it under a heating lamp and it was disgusting. Save your money and go someplace else."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere.  They had a live band playing inside, roping competition outside and a large patio with plenty of gas fire pits."}
{"text":"Should be 0. Not only have I seen lemonade stands run better, but this place was 0 stars all around.  I don't care that your cook quit yesterday, forcing you to tell customers you couldn't take food order or mozzarella sticks would take 1 hr.  Your disgusting bathrooms, overflow of trash cans and your inept bartenders are additional telling signs of how this might be the most poorly run establishment I have ever seen. Words can't describe how bad this place is...and it's too bad because the decor and setup are not horrible.  And this was not our 1st time (similar last couple times) but guaranteed last.  Done."}
{"text":"Could be a fabulous spot but stopped here about 4 pm (today) and with only 6 folks at the outside bar it seemed confusing to the couple of staff members as to who should serve us...and when asked about the happy hour she was perplexed. Not sure of the time or the drink prices.  The couple we walked in with (not friends just another couple looking to try a new bar) didn't get served until 10 min after us. Excellent spot in the edge of a corral with cows \"with horns\" (bulls) and views of the surrounding hills.  Service is a mystery and why isn't someone correcting this?  I suspect the \"new Management\" sign out front will be replace with \"new management again\".  Give it a try and hope for the best."}
