{"text":"If you're a true shawarma lover, then you will like this place. They use the right sauces, and will add the perfect soft fries to your shawarma. If you're like me, you know all the fakers around town that stare at you blankly when you ask for fries in the shawarma, but this place satisfies that craving. They are delicious, as is their shawarma meat. Get it with fries and pickled turnips for that authentic taste, trust me. A bit high on price but on par with other food trucks."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for good straight up versions of middle eastern street food. The chicken tawouk (yoghurt spice marinated) with its tasty Toom (garlic) sauce was moist and satisfying, stuffed in a pita with turnip, lettuce, fries etc. as the daily special it came with a free pop, a nice touch that makes parting with a $10 bill easier. The 25 minute wait was the only big downside. If they were able to pump these out faster given the three staff, I might bump it up to four stars."}
{"text":"This food truck gets a solid 3 stars. The Shawarmas have lots of herbs and spice.  The shawarm I got was huge and I made 2 meals out of it.  I have attached a picture of Tawook wrap (which is basically a shawarma with white chicken meat) & Falafel veggie wrap. My co-worker Carmel was kind enough to be the hand model for the photo. The other photo is the price list."}
{"text":"looks good but tastes bland.  needs to change oil. undercooked or just result of freezing  store bought falafels from a bag,  why cant you just mix up your own? what a waste, steer cleer of this truck.  kind of ridiculous to be  doing what u can do at home for free,  shawarma looks raw"}
{"text":"Food trucks are awesome, so why not have a shawarma?  An hour and a half ago I called my buddy and asked if he wanted to go for lunch and he suggested we hit up a food truck. Shawarma In Motion was right near our buildings, so we walked over and luckily got there right before the line developed. I ordered a beef shawarma ($9) and then attempted to check in on Yelp and realized no one had put it up yet! Having never tried shawarma before, I was expecting more of a donair style of sandwich but was pleasantly surprised when it was quite different instead. The sandwich I was provided was very delicious and very filling. The beef was cooked to a light crisp on some of the edges and served with some fresh veges in a grilled pita. All in all a great lunch for quite cheap.  If you want to find out where the Shawarma in Motion truck is, you should check out one of the food truck apps that're available in your phone's app store.
