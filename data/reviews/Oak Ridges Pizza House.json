{"text":"We ordered a pizza from this place last night, the pizza was quite good, fresh toppings and overall friendly staff. The only reason they are not getting 5 stars is because the delivery guy was running a bit late"}
{"text":"Absolutely great pies come out of this little gem in Oak Ridges. The team running things are super nice and very pleasant. Slice choices are limited but if you're just in the mood for simple, I recommend you give them a chance."}
{"text":"Have to say, this place had fast service with a delicious gluten free selection. I'm usually a little hesitant because most gluten free pizza offered by restaurants is pretty bland and dry, but this place had a great one at a very reasonable price. The toppings were very fresh as well and it wasn't overly greasy which for me was a bonus. Now that I live in RH, this will definitely be my go to for pizza!"}
{"text":"I usually grab there walk in special if I'm in the mood for pizza. Great taste and solid amount of toppings. Today I had the fried panzerotto which was quite delicious and filling."}
{"text":"Had ordered their large pizza with chicken wings .. Not too great, all right pizza .. Thought their crust or the cheese was too heavy .. Chicken wings weren't great and too greasy .. Thought it was expensive as well compared to pizza pizza or pizzaville"}
{"text":"I used to live in that area and regularly went for the walk in cheese special.  Which was always good.

This time, I ventured out of the comfort zone and tried a meat pizza.  The salt load was overpowering and we could not even finish the slices we had.

Overall not a good experience.

Will stick with the standard going forward as it is a seriously good deal."}
{"text":"Fast delivery, arrived hot, polite driver and good pizza. Fresh ingredients and tasty..Thanks"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Good pizza and love the panzerotti there.  The prices are very good and the order-to-ready time is always quick.  My only complaint is that the food is a bit too greasy for my preference, so I'll sop up the grease with paper towel before eating.  Other than that, go for it!"}
{"text":"Take out special is great. Lots of topping options and free toppings. If you haven't tried: Get their potato wedges as a pizza topping."}
{"text":"This was the worst pizza I've had in a long time.  I ordered a \"Margherita\" pizza.  It was so bland!  Plus i'm fairly certain they used spinach and not basil.  I would not order from here again."}
{"text":"I really like the pizza here. I usually get a slice or 2 of the Canadian and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service. Pizza was bomb! Everything was perfect except potatoes wedges, too salty."}
{"text":"Best 'za I've ordered in the area.  Second only to Dantes in my opinion, but Pizza House is way cheaper."}
{"text":"Amazing local pizza place! True local Italian pizza taste. I'm always coming back for their $10 Large Pizza deal."}
{"text":"Everyone has a different preference when it comes to pizza.  Some prefer crust, some lots of cheese, some like tomato sauce...I love a nice tomato sauce with strong sauces.  Pizza House makes the best sauce in the Oak Ridges area.  Add some onions, red peppers and hot sausage."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza places in oakridges. Its fast fresh and most importantly better then its competitors pizza pizza and dominoes. I reccomend stopping in a md getting a slice."}
{"text":"Oak Ridges lost its best pizza place years ago  when Pepinos's closed its doors due to unfortunate circumstances. There was a brief time when we had to resort to mediocre chain pizza. It was a bleak time. A time we don't speak of lightly here in the Oaks. Thankfully, Pizza House is here and it is amazing pizza. The quality of the ingredients, the perfect consistency of the crust, and, if you try hard enough, you can also taste the love they put into it. I ordered an extra large pizza a few days ago and have happily eaten pizza for the last three days. It's good hot, it's good cold. It's good is what I'm saying. Really really good. The golden era of pizza has returned to Oak Ridges."}
{"text":"No frills, no bull: just good pizza."}
