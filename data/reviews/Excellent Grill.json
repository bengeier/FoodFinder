{"text":"As someone who loves breakfest, I'm always looking for a good spot in Newmarket. I stopped in to Excellent Grill to try it out. I ordered the steak and eggs, and man was it great. The steak was cooked perfectly and the eggs and home fries were nice and crispy. We were also very pleased with the friendly and diligent service we received from Nellie, our server. Our overall experience was really good, and will be back soon to try some other delicious items on their menu."}
{"text":"Didn't know know this place existed, but it's been around for a year. This could be the best breakfast in Newmarket. My girlfriend and I had the traditional breakfast which consisted of three large eggs, 4 pieces of sausage/bacon, home fries and toast. The portions were huge. The taste was delicious. The bacon and sausage were cooked to perfection. The home fries were home made. Nice atmosphere and the server was friendly and helpful. Great price too. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent service
Food are below average, Sunset Grill in Aurora has better taste by far
Grease still left over inside fries.
Portion is smaller than Sunset
Price higher than Sunset for sure
Sunset Aurora much better environment"}
{"text":"Great service ... excellent food  the breakfast was just as good as your sunset grill ... the price was good for two people breakfest or will cost $24.00 with tax. The owner is really nice and friendly .. definitely recommend coming here for all day breakfest"}
{"text":"This wonderful new breakfast spot recently opened in the east end of Newmarket. I've tried it a few times. I tried their pancakes during my first visit. It was a HUGE portion and quite good, very filling and comforting. During my second trip, I had a mix of things: eggs, bacon, sausage and toast with some French toast on the side. Most recently, I stopped in for a quick breakfast first thing in the morning before heading off to work (I was famished and had a headache following little sleep after a late night). I had a western omelette with toast and coffee. When I told the server that I was in a rush to get to work and wanted to pay while I was waiting, both she and the cook were quick to accommodate me. I was more than happy to leave them both a generous tip as my thanks. The food, service and prices are all great. I quite like their coffee too. If you go on their Facebook page, you'll read their specials and interactions with their friends and customers. It's a nice, down-home, cozy feel and ambiance. I don't get over there as often as I would like but will try to do better because I'm missing out! A must-try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Can't beat a 3 egg brekky with bacon, home fries and toast for under $5 (currently a special, I don't know if it will continue forever).  Under new management, this is a non-chain operated restaurant that is fighting it out with the likes of Sunset Grill and Daybreak.  I only tried the breakfast so far, but the prices are good, the food was good, and I see no reason not to go back.

It's definitely in the race!"}
{"text":"Awesome service as soon as we walked in!! Three other tables were full but the waitress was very attentive to all tables. She was always busy cleaning, making sure all was in order and She filled our coffees up quite frequently which was awesome and just the right timing! Lots of options for breakfast! The breakfast was very very good.  We will definitely be back. I can't say enough about this place!! Wonderful to be able to leave a great review!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a new place to have breakfast and she saw this restaurant as we were driving by on Leslie street. She has an intolerance to eggs, so her choices at breakfast are very limited. Well just looking at the menu posted in the window, I knew that she was going to really love this place. She had at least 5 choices for a breakfast meal that did not include eggs, a very rare thing. We both had the bagel with cream cheese, smoked salmon, capers and onion. It was served on a platter, open faced with a surprising amount of salmon. We were expecting only a small portion, but this place really delivered. The coffee was also very good. Our server Nellie was very attentive and answered our inquiries expertly.
The prices are very reasonable and portions are large, (we saw others plates with bacon, eggs and home fries, and they were quite full).
This will be our new breakfast place.
The restaurant is under new management and we wish the owners the best of luck."}
{"text":"It's called Excellent Grill and it really is. Went for brunch with my dad and everything was delicious. The fresh squeezed OJ, salmon eggs benny and my dad's steak was super good too. I got a little greedy and ordered a pancake too but didn't finish it because I was so full from the benny. Nice staff too, clean and comfy and excellent value for
Money. Definitely my new Newmarket brunch spot."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our breakfast here. The coffee is very good, the portions are large, the restaurant is bright and clean, the menu is varied and the staff is very friendly. Our food arrived very quickly as well. We shared a spicy chicken omelette with the intention to share pancakes but we were too full to get them. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great mom and pop breakfast and lunch place. Amazing value for your money and everything is fresh and cooked to order. What I love about it is that it is not a franchise but privately owned and I believe in supporting local business.  It's fast, not fancy and you know you will have a great consistent meal.  Love their egg breakfasts and their coffee is so good!"}
