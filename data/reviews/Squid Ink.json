{"text":"This place is ok.  Cool atmosphere and the dishes taste pretty good.  Just a bit expensive for the portion size compared to other favorite places."}
{"text":"Squid Ink is one of my favorite sushi places for a few reasons. happy hour til 7? YES...it's the only one I ever make it to on time, (even if it is 6:51 when I arrive haha) They have simple options, but also some unique and more complex dishes.  Love the ambience-the bar is outdoor and indoor, so you can sit outside but still feel like you are inside.The artwork is very unique and clearly not purchased at iKea or Target... :)"}
{"text":"Great happy hour congenial staff awesome ambiance especially for one hell of a buzz for prefacing !!!"}
{"text":"I love sushi so I'm totally biased. Not really great prices. Service was ok. The restaurant was nice and clean and food was great."}
{"text":"The food at the Squid Ink is great but the service is slow and the noise level is almost intolerable. The music is terrible and distracts from the experience being a great ont."}
{"text":"Went in on a pretty busy night, was seated and served quickly with a smile.  The food was awesome, and the service was attentive.  Good place to take a date, or just go out for drinks."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, excellent if you like spicy food. Delicious seaweed salad, refreshing yummy green tea. Yum!"}
{"text":"Really had my hopes up for this place and was super disappointed. Went with my wife and got seated at the bar area; sat there for at least 10 mins before anyone even acknowledged our existence. After placing just a drink order for two beers waited another 15 minutes to get those. The sushi was very mediocre and have had much better. After getting about halfway through our first roll another waitress came over with menus and place settings asking us what we would like to order for drinks somehow she missed we had already been there an hour and was trying to reserve us...That was a first in my book. Just poor poor service at this place."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch today. I had the sushi lunch sampler. Now I am throwing up and my stomach is churning. I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, and will continue to do so. If I'm by myself, I like to just sit at the sushi bar and read a book or chat up the sushi chefs. I've always had great food and service here. I've come here for lunch, casual dining, birthday parties, to pick up food before work when I'm running late, you name it. All of the house rolls are amazing, especially the surf n turf, and the miso soup is very delicious. They have a lunch special and happy hour, so make sure you check it out! They also provide an industry discount, which is pretty dang awesome, if you ask me."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, with a ton of options and great appetizers. Never disappoints. Even if you're not a sushi person there some great options on the menu. Always great service here as well, favorite place to come in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour! Their Scottsdale location went out of business, but my friend lives on the west side so we tried this out on a Sunday night when I had a sushi craving. Their crag rangoons have solid chunks of crab and the best dipping sauce I've ever had. Try their Buffalo Chicken roll- it's kind of odd but if you like buffalo sauce- tasty! Their patio is really nice and our server was friendly. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had the best time with some buddies yesterday afternoon.  Amy was the bartender and she was awesome, not once did I have to wait for a drink and she had great recommendations for food.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm not the type to leave a review but the service was horrible today. I got there with 3 friends at around 12:20 and we put in our order immediately for our entrees and an appetizer. We didn't get our appetizer for about 20 minutes and then our waitress told us that the kitchen was substituting brown rice with white rice so we said that was fine. We waited for one hour for her to bring out vegetables and 4 pieces of shrimp, we asked where our rice was and she said they ran out so we wouldn't be getting some.. We told her we weren't going to eat there because first of all she told us we would be getting white rice and then for her to not bring us any rice, we didn't even get a full meal. She asked if we wanted to speak to the manager and we waited for 5 minutes for the manager to never show. We needed up just getting up and leaving... Safe to say me nor my friends will ever go here again and you shouldn't either. Worst customer service ever."}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked grilled salmon with vegetables.  Really loved the hamachi kama and  varailety of appetizers. Great happy hours specials as well."}
{"text":"Just horrid food  We had two rolls, one a surf and turf that was virtually inedible. Another spicy roll that was acceptable.   Bartender was good, made a special drink for my wife that she enjoyed.  Still, the food was simply terrible"}
{"text":"Went to Squid Ink last weekend. My total I'll was 89.19 and I tipped the waitress with cash. Looked at my debit card statement and someone added a tip to my receipt. Disputed the charge and will never go back!"}
{"text":"Not great you don't get what you pay for. I was expecting the sushi rolls to be bigger for the price. Not satisfied. 2 rolls were $30 and so small!!! I'm sticking to my favorite spot in Tempe! We only went here because we were on a time crunch and live near by."}
{"text":"Tuna was not good, sushi either, with dry extremities. Staff very friendly though. Good if you choose the rools. Hand rool was good with salmon, but not the sashimi. Will come back, but will avoid sashimi."}
{"text":"I live downtown and there aren't many good places for happy hour. Squid Ink to me, is one of the best. The service is always above par, the staff is consistently friendly. The music is always rockin.  The food has never disappointed.  It is always fresh and hot. I could go on, it's just refreshing to go somewhere and get consistency and great customer service."}
{"text":"Started with a white wine recommendation from the server, which didn't disappoint. Custard Chardonnay complimented the rest of our happy hour meal.   I ordered my usual green bean tempura, a healthier alternative to fries. Always perfectly cooked. Spicy salmon and shrimp tempura rolls are great choices for happy hour.   FYI all appetizers are half off for happy hour and Tuesdays are half off wine bottles from 7 pm to close. It's a great place to take your friends. And it's in the heart of downtown. The patio is a great place for people watching...  I gave it 4 stars because there were a couple of opprtunistic flies hovering which was annoying. But they were gone after a few minutes. No big."}
{"text":"Amazing. Went for restaurant week and was thoroughly impressed. Had the crag rangoon, flying phoenix roll, coconut curry shrimp, miso cod and Hawaiian bread pudding. Everything was wonderful. It did not disappoint. Had $5 cocktails during happy hour too.  This is a can't miss. Already making plans to go back again."}
{"text":"Great food! Great people and staff! Great view!! Amazing memories!    The food is original and interesting while still capturing what an out of towner or sushi buff would expect from a downtown Sushi place!  Specialty cocktails are fun and well poured! Full bar of course and the usual bartender is waaaay cool and not bad to look at. Lol.    So easily accessible from downtown bars and hotels. Definitely worth the occasional drive in to the city even for Glendale and further like us.    My mother is a world class traveler and has eaten at some pretty top notch places. When she visits she eats here several times during her stay. She loves the black cod appetizer!!"}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw this place open up since my GF lives in the area.  We went for HH and the decor and ambiance was nice.   We did get seated at a table and I noticed one fly, then another fly, and I looked back at the window to see around eight flies hovering by the window.   We asked to move and got seated again promptly.  Our server was nice and prompt with everything.  Since is was HH we decided to order some apps & sushi at HH prices.   The sushi was ok (I wasn't expecting Hana quality sushi.  I would equate to RA quality sushi)  with the scallop roll being the best of the bunch.   My GF got the squid and Nancy which was ok with the jalapeño sauce being very good but it was nothing like the calamari at Zen 32.  The best item I had was the wings which seems odd at a sushi bar but they were some of the best wings I had in awhile.  I would go back to try some different stuff.   I am a big fan of locally owned establishments and I hope this one makes it.   Hopefully next time I go I will steer clear of sake so I can enjoy me meal a little better.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Arizona seems to have an abundance of kind and knowledgable servers at their establishments and Kyle at Squid Ink is no exception. He was attentive and took time to explain anything we had a question about. Happy hour prices are amazing and the price doesn't affect the quality in the least."}
{"text":"This was our third visit.  The absolute BEST sushi in town.  Tonight was our first opportunity with Happy Hour.   Great value pointed out by Jade, our wonderful server.  We tasted grilled squid, miso black cod ( the definition of Unctuous) and the edamame for the kids.  Fabulous.  Then had the Blind Phoenix for hubby ( I am allergic to tuna) and he loved it.  We asked for tagaroshi on the side and Jade totally got it.  Brendan did a great job running the food.  Our 17 year old son loved the ramen and our 9 year old daughter ate the chicken with ramen noodles. She loved it.  We had salmon and cream cheese and many other roles.  The spider was my favorite.  Josh, the manager spoke to us and appreciated our comments.  A great experience!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment this place is becoming.  Employees especially the hostesses never smile or make you feel wecome. The high employee turnover has become evident. They can't even successfully execute a California roll that doesn't fall apart. This was our favorite hang out,  but after our dinner yesterday,  will not be back."}
{"text":"Sushi was mediocre and our waitress was incredibly rude. It was a Saturday night and they had a guy singing on guitar that was so loud no one in our party could talk to each other. Would not come back here or recomend this restaraunt."}
{"text":"So....  Kaci..  Sweetest and most attentive server ever.  Made sure I had everything I needed, while being unobtrusive.  Poured my sake (nice aware touch), and a totally personable woman... Highly recommended restaurant AND server !!"}
{"text":"I would give them 4 stars if not for our previous visit. I've only been to Squid Ink a couple of times, and will likely try it again, however the most recent visit left myself (and others in the party) conflicted about this establishment.   The first time we tried it, the service was good - friendly, attentive, helpful and also very knowledgable. The food was also good. I wouldn't venture to say spectacular, as I am a bit of a sushi snob, but for this part of town, it's as fresh as I've had. And it was executed attractively, and the flavors were great. There was one roll that we regretted ordering (I believe it was the Yellowtail Scallion roll), as it was completely bland - read - had no flavor whatsoever. However, the other rolls really made up for it. The Nigiri was also fresh and flavorful - which is my favorite part of going out for sushi! I was also delighted by the Basil Grapefruit Martini...reasonably priced compared to what you would pay elsewhere. Many of the reviews rave about the Cougar roll - it is good, indeed. It's refreshing and light. I'm not a huge fan of tempura rolls, but I really enjoyed the Jibs roll, as well. And the Spicy Yellowtail was delicious - nice and spicy, yet you could still taste the fish! And don't miss out on the Garlic Edamame...you won't be able to stop eating it until it's gone.   Now...the second visit. After a lovely visit the first time, a family member decided to have her birthday dinner there. Granted, we had a large party - 10 patrons. This restaurant isn't huge, but it isn't a hole in the wall, either. We had to wait for space (which is completely understandable), but the wait was reasonable and they accommodated us without any problems. However, we watched them wipe down the tables that we would be sitting at, and it was done so poorly that one of the people in the party literally had to get a bar rag THEMSELVES to clean the tables - because when he asked an employee for help, they did nothing. Also, they did not have enough small plates or sauce dishes for our table. Which wasn't a huge deal, but, you would think they would be more proactive about doing dishes on a Saturday night? They also ran out of water glasses, so most of the party didn't have any water until about 25 minutes after being seated.   Once again, the food was good - nothing to complain about there, which is good, otherwise I wouldn't even give them 3 stars. The problem was really with the service. The first thing said to us by the server was, \"It's going to be fine to put this all on one check, right?\" As someone who has spent most of their life in the service industry, I was dumbfounded. Moving on...she really did try hard. A 10-top is a lot of work, as anyone in the restaurant industry knows. Overwhelming? Probably shouldn't be...but it really was on this night. When we first came in, all the tables in the dining room were occupied, and they had several servers handling it. Once we were sat, there were a few other tables and us - but they cut the other servers (or so it seemed - our server was the only one left working the dining room). Why did they leave it to one server to handle 3 tables and a large party? Pitiful planning and it showed.   Almost all of the food was correct. Between all of us, we ordered 7 Yellowtail Nigiris. NOBODY at the table ordered yellowtail sashimi. When the orders were read back to us, \"Yellowtail Nigiri\" is what was read. However, when the first 5 came out - we were given FIVE orders of Yellowtail Sashimi. WOW. That was a lot of food that we didn't order. We pointed out to the server that we had all ordered Nigiri, and she quickly said, \"Oh, I'm sorry, it must have gotten mixed up.\" Then we asked her to make sure that the next two came out as Nigiri, NOT Sashimi. At that point, we hadn't even gotten to the point of being concerned about being well overcharged for something we didn't order. We decided as a group to just eat it and pay for what came out. Until the next two came out as Sashimi, as well. At this time, she then apologized again and stated that we wouldn't be charged for the Sashimi as it was a mixup. Okay, fine - we will deal with it.   When the bill came...was the issue rectified at all as promised? Absolutely not. We were charged for 7 orders of Sashimi, when Nigiri is what we ordered.  I think it was roughly a $35-ish difference. On a bill of over $500, I guess it's not that substantial, but it should have been fixed.   If only one, or even two negetive things would have happened that night, it definitely wouldn't have been so bad. But between the table, dish & server issues, the off-putting greeting, the order/kitchen mixup, the failure to rectify it, and the disregard for doing so, it was disappointing."}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite sushi spot. The ambiance is vibrant, the sushi is the freshest I've had and I live on the Oregon coast! The staff were extremely welcoming, tentative and extremely attractive (don't tell my wife ;)). We had a great time! Well done!"}
{"text":"Went here with a large group for a birthday and the service was HORRIBLE!  It took us forever to get our food and half the orders were wrong.  Some of the food was delicious; other food was just okay.  It might be better on a weekday but horrible on a Sat night."}
{"text":"This is  (was) my son's favorite place for sushi.  He got to pick where we ate tonight and of course chose Squid Ink!  He had 2 orders of salmon sashimi,one spicy salmon roll and one spicy tuna roll.  He has eaten a lot of sushi and knows what he likes.  He first started off with the sashimi. A bone poked him in the tongue.  It wasn't bad but it startled him.  We just kind of laughed and he kept eating.  He had never had a bone in his sushi, and he has eaten a lot of sushi over the years.  When he got to the spicy tuna roll he put it in his mouth and immediately spit it out.  He said it tasted bad and he was really grossed out!  We told the waitress and she offered him something else.  They were nice enough to take the tuna roll off of our bill.  He ordered another spicy salmon roll.  As luck would have it there was another bone!!  This one was over an inch long and if he bit into the sushi the wrong way could have really hurt him.  At this point, I took a picture of the bone, paid the bill and left.  Probably won't  go back."}
{"text":"Went to Squid Ink last night for my birthday dinner and I can honestly say I'm always impressed with not only the quality of the food, but the service as well. The hostess and waitresses were so kind! I would recommend the potstickers and, if you like spicy, the \"dirty rockstar\" sushi roll. The mussels were so good, but then again I've never had anything I didn't like at Squid Ink. Go for happy hour and all of the best rolls are half off... How can pass that up?! Delicious."}
{"text":"Pricey for portion size. My fiancé and I had a $124 tab. A similar meal last night at a nearby sushi place was $58. Great waitress! I enjoyed the outside eating area, too."}
{"text":"While squid ink is hidden among the scaffolding and progress in downtown phoenix,  we found the service and food to be very good. The menu offered a limited number of specialty rolls, however all o the ones we tried were flavorful and unique. We were in the mood for sushi and didn't try any of the other items on the menu, but there were several other options. The feature appetizer was stuffed jalapeños with crab and cheese- good and not too hot. Over all, a good sushi experience."}
{"text":"Squid Ink is a sushi bar located on Central Avenue in downtown Phoenix (most central/southern-most edge of the downtown area). There is a fee for the parking garage, which is located in the same building. It is very convenient.  The hostess who seated us looked rather unkempt, and she had pimply shoulders, which were exposed in a stringy tank top and kinda gross, but she was friendly. At first, the service was slow. We didn't know when the server would come and take our order--granted the restaurant was full, which is actually a good sign.  Once we got our drink order in it took a few minutes longer than we would have liked, but then things got rolling. We ordered several courses, and quite a lot of sushi. All of our food came out rather quickly. Way faster than I would have imagined for any restaurant, much less a sushi bar (which typically takes more time).  The miso is excellent. The seared beef dish was incredible--the meat was tender, like butter. Amazing! The cooked salmon with the kale salad was \"the best ever\" according to our table guest. The sashimi platter and suhi roll platters were just a scosh sparser than we would have liked, but the fish was impeccable. Really. Wow!  House chardonnay was buttery, not metallic. Water and tea were refilled with regularity, and as the food arrived we realized the whole staff worked very well together as a team. More than five different people came and went from our table, making sure we were taken care of. Everyone was friendly and professional.  Over all the value was very good. The prices were good. We loved our meal and we are definitely going back there!  If you sit outside there is a misting system, so you stay cool. Plus, the people watching is really fun.  Happy hour is all throughout the week--half price \"starters\", so that's always a good deal.  We recommend!"}
{"text":"I went here for happy hour and had a blast. Happy Hour was from 3-7 and the prices were very cheap on the HH menu. We started off with the sweet potatoes fries, which were very tasty. We had the chicken wings and the 3 different sushi rolls and 3 dollar well drinks. The service was good and the bathrooms were clean and overall a great experience. I would defiantly go back for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with a coworker on opening day...good food that was way over-priced...  $11 to $14 for a roll.  They offered no lunch specials.   Won't go back for lunch unless they start some good deals.  Might be a fun place on a night before a game."}
{"text":"OMG! This is my new favorite Sushi spot in phoenix, I've been a huge fan of Ra Sushi for quite sometime but I can now say Squid Ink is on top!  I walked in & decided to sit at the bar where you have a nice view of the city of phoenix ( taxis rolling by along with traffic noise) took me away to NYC!! Just for sec lol atmosphere is perfect for those long days you want to be taken away, maybe the drink \"Tune in Tokyo\" brought everything together just perfectly!!!  Dish: Coconut Curry Shrimp!! Amazing!!! ITS SO GOOD- I will probably have a hard time not ordering it when I go there!!!  Service was great! Definitely will be back many times to come! Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"This was the second time we've been here and frankly we were disappointed. The miso soup was tasteless, just warm water with a few bland mushrooms floating on the top and a couple small pieces of tofu. The Manhattan I ordered was mostly sweet vermouth, undrinkable.    After the miso we had ordered the crab rangoon.  Normally I love these things but they were just mediocre here with cream cheese with a few random pieces of left over crab (or maybe it was krab) stuffed into a chewy doughy pouch.    Next we had the Surf n Turf Roll with was basically a roll that cost a lot, sounds good, with expensive ingredients that is drowned in mayo they call aioli.     For the main course we had order the Beef Yakisoba, and the Tuna Tataki.  The yakisoba, which was the good the first time we went, was a ball of overcooked noodles, matted into a doughy mass.  It was uneatable.  The Tuna we ordered came out 10 minutes after my meal, and turned out to be salmon.  Since the waiter never came back my date just decided to eat it.  It was overcooked too,l with a generic sauce that masked any taste the salmon might have had.  This place might be good to grab a quick lunch to take back to your cubicle but this is not a place for a business lunch or a sit down dinner. I guess the fact they have a fast food take out window should have been a good indicator of quality.  This is a place for office worker to get a generic alternative to a sandwich, but not a place I would go back to."}
{"text":"This place is SO GOOD. My favorites are the Surf + Turf roll + the Coconut Curry Shrimp. Amazing!   The staff is also super nice + usually pretty fast. This place is a sure thing."}
{"text":"This is our third time here and their hot dishes are definitely on point. We can't get enough of the miso black cod app. Ramen and beef short ribs are good as well. Nice generous portions and good flavors. My fiancé ordered sashimi platter and they were super thin so when Dan the owner asked how our food was, we expressed our disappointment and just like that, he got us a brand new platter with large thick pieces of sashimi! That's how you do good business."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the pleasure of dining at Squid Ink on their Grand Opening Day. We ordered the Flying Phoenix Roll and the Cougar Roll. Both Rolls were amazing.  The Sushi chefs were very pleasant and accommodating when it came to making our sushi.  We don't like mayo so they substituted it with something else, which shows me they have great customer service. Overall great tasting sushi and great dining experience."}
{"text":"Yums: Roasted garlic edamame           Cougar roll  Not so yums: Tea is mediocre at best  Service is good and very attentive. I am thrilled to have a good sushi restaurant so close. Their rolls are good and inventive and their fish is very fresh."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and it was amazing. The service was great and they made us whatever rolls we wanted. We will be returning soon"}
{"text":"First timer at Squid ink and the vibe was great since I walked in. We had an amazing server named Harlen! The sushi was so fresh and delicious Definitely will be back soon."}
{"text":"This place has an inviting ambiance and a cool feel. The service is good and quick.  The food is not that great... I ordered the ramen and it had absolutely no flavor. It tasted like noodles in water which was pretty disappointing. We also started with garlic edamame which was good but a little too buttery. I can say the coconut milk rice pudding was mmmm!"}
{"text":"The ultimate philly roll was amazing! The wonton dumpling soup was excellent also! Nice outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"Service is not great. It took us 1 hour and 20 minutes to get our food and we are still waiting on our last roll. The server seemed disconnected from her customers and only visiting us drop each roll off, never staying for more than two seconds."}
{"text":"The downtown Phoenix location of Squid Ink Sushi gave me one of the most memorable dining experiences. I attempted to eat the worst ramen I have EVER had. Though the presentation was very nice with Krab meat, pork belly, scallions, and egg - the taste was a massive disappointment.  The broth was bland and actually bitter. It tasted of diluted burnt meat. The noodles, which looked like they came out of a Top Ramen package, shaped in a block with wavy noodles, were overcooked. They were too soft and lacked any bite. I'm surprised this is still on the menu.   An odd side note, when the waitress retrieved my uneaten bowl, she actually asked if I wanted a box to take it home - instead of asking if there was anything wrong."}
{"text":"Came here before a show and it was worth it as usual. Great sushi and delicious desserts. The bread pudding and tempura rolls are highly recommended."}
{"text":"Pros: Really great service, good vibe, you don't have to yell to be heard even in a full house, good food presentation, good drinks (strawberry lemonade isn't on the menu but is exceptional)  Prices overall are in a decent spot; right about the average for legit dine-in sushi places.  Cons: Unfortunately, the sushi was bland. We had a variety of both standard rolls and house rolls and everyone unanimously agreed that the sushi simply didn't have much of a taste at all. Personally, the only hint of flavor I tasted was was in a fried jalapeno.  Overall, I enjoyed being there, just not because of the food."}
{"text":"Visited this place because it was close to my hotel and it had Beef Negamaki on the menu. It is definitely a trendy place for sushi, meaning its a bit pricey and pretentious. I got the impression they get a large late night crowd that doesn't care if it's bad or not, it's food and sake. They sat me outside at a table on the rail that was so close to the sidewalk, people were walking right by the table.  I only thing I liked was Sapporro on draft. What I didn't like was the dirty spoon they served with my Miso soup. When the waiter brought me a regular silver spoon and said, \"here you go\" without an apology, I knew it would be the last time I'd be here. The food was just ok, but if you go, bring your own silverware."}
{"text":"Dirty rock star ... That's just the 'bomb'   great bartenders/ staff and easy to park and clean too"}
{"text":"Great sushi pretty girls awsome service. Great date nite to dine in. Very couzy place"}
{"text":"I am from San Francisco, CA and every corner has sushi. Not a fan, that is until Squid Ink. Delicious is not a strong enough adjective to describe the food and cocktails,(try their Mojito,had 4) Everything was yummy. New favorite, the Vegas Rolls. Dipped in Tempura baste and fried. OMG! Next trip screw the diet and it Mojitos and Vegas Rolls. The server was so adorably delightful and patient. Best nights to go is when live music is playing, Fridays I believe. Unless you prefer Happy Hour, (who doesn't need a drink after work?) Bring your Sushi-phobic friends, they'll thank you."}
{"text":"From my experience, and the experience of the four other people I dined with, the sushi here is really, really good. Delicious, good sized, and the variety of rolls we can try is excellent.  The only off-putting thing about my vegetarian roll was that it included tempura asparagus and cream cheese. I'm under the general assumption that, if I'm ordering something with strictly vegetables, it won't have anything fried in it, and it will mention if it includes a dairy product. So I was a bit disappointed by this. However, I ate it, and it was good - just not what I expected, or wanted at that moment."}
{"text":"This is in a great location in the heart of downtown.  The decor is very nice and the staff is friendly and attentive.  The drink menu was nice and varied with attention to not only specialty cocktails but also having a decent selection of more pedestrian fare.  However, this is a sushi bar and it all relies on the fish and rice.  And here is where it swings downhill quickly.  The fish used for nigiri was dry.  Even when it came out you could see that it was lacking a sheen of freshness.  The rice used complimented the dry fish.  It was typically a lump of poorly formed rice that seemed to have all the life sucked out of it.  I cannot recommend this place for sushi.  Rolls were good and we did not try any of the non-fish fare."}
{"text":"Great place fit sushi at a great deal. Bartender Brooke was super helpful and knew the menu well. Loved the garlic edamame. Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots downtown. I love the green bean tempura, the crab ragoons are tasty and I really like the chicken and rice bowl. You get the right amount of chicken, veggies and rice. Very tasty and the servers are really nice. The atmosphere is pretty cool also. On a nice day it is nice to sit out on the patio."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food and atmosphere here! My first time coming in so I was a little intimidated, but the staff is very friendly and the food is delicious. One of the sushi chefs behind the bar struck up a small conversation with me.  I had the miso soup and spicy tuna rolls - both were very tasty! If never quite had proper sushi before, just a California roll, but I have to say I'm addicted now! The miso soup was also my first taste of tofu and I enjoyed that as well.  The restaurant overall is very clean and nicely decorated, and the bar is lovely, with all of the fish up for display. It's nice and light and airy inside, with a cool modern scheme. I'll definitely be coming back sometime soon, and I've been thinking of making it a weekly trip! Highly re conned this place for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I'd recommend you check you credit card statements and all transactions with this merchant.  I was charged $113 tip on a bill of $97.58.  I wrote $110.58 in the total and after I left, they added $113 to the tip line and changed the 1 to a 2, so the total would be $210.58, instead of $110.58.  The owner, Schuyler is not willing to accept the fact, his staff **might** do something unethical like this and insists I left this tip.  He also told me it is common for his staff to get large, gracious tips like this.  It is very disappointing now I have to protect myself by working through the police on fraudulent activity, which costs all of us in the end."}
{"text":"The sushi is really good! Its a lil pricey but ive seen worse. The staff always looks like they want to shoot themeselves though! There never super friendly or welcoming which is ashame because this place could have such good potential."}
{"text":"Squid Ink Sushi Bar.. WOW!! I have not been to a sushi bar like this in a while. The atmosphere is very pleasant and welcoming, much like the workers :) I have eaten there twice already and each time has been absolute satisfaction! My favorites are the cougar roll, the surf n turf roll, as well as the perfectly grilled teriyaki chicken. I noticed the most famous appetizers were the edamame, (which also can be ordered with garlic) and the chicken wings. Many people I talked to felt the same way as I did about this wonderful restaurant. Another cool thing is that they have 2 happy hours!! Normal happy hour is from 3pm-6pm and their reverse happy hour is from 10pm-12pm. They also have a double sided bar so you are welcome to sit inside or outside, and with the summer heat finally starting to die down, I think that is a very smart and original idea. Overall, Squid Ink Sushi Bar is and will be a big hit for a long time due to their helpful and kind employees, the AMAZING and versatile menu, and the warmth of the atmosphere :) Keep it up guys!!"}
{"text":"This sushi place is a total ripoff. What they call a poke salad is a total joke consisting of 3 pieces of tuna. I'm an experienced sushi consumer. It angers me this place is charging so much for so little product. Please avoid them!!!"}
{"text":"Brian was a pleasure ! It's nice to know great service is not extinct! He was courteous , efficient and made my friends bachelorette party a hit! Glad we stopped in here and got to meet this amazing gent ! Did I mention he is Joey Lawrence's clone :) We will  definitely be back ! Thank you Brian our Angel behind the bar! Please keep this man around please!"}
{"text":"Always a get place to eat, socialize and have fun. It's consistently excellent. The staff is attentive and friendly. Always there with a smile and quick service."}
{"text":"Went in tonight fully planning on having dinner there, and received some of the worst service I've ever experienced. I sat at the bar, and if I didn't ask specifically for something I wouldn't have received it. Not once was I asked if I was okay, or if I wanted anything else. It was really a joke. I've never not left a tip for service, but today was as close as I've ever got. I will not go back to this establishment again, that was it. I ended up having dinner at 71 Diner, and was pleased I made that choice."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for two years now and I don't know why. I know why but I can't say....The food is average at best.  Happy hour is a decent deal if you don't mind how loud the bar can get with all the regulars yelling across the bee from the outside. I always get the sashimi and the freshness or the quality of cuts are NEVER consistent. Must be\"grumpy face\" from another review. Thank God I'm moving from this area and won't have to rely on this place."}
{"text":"I went for the surf n turf roll and I was not disappointed. The service was awesome (thank you Victor), the food was delicious, and the wine was perfection. Overall a great place to dine! We will be returning."}
{"text":"I chose to come on Monday 3/14/'16 around 6:00 pm. The female bartender was not friendly, had her excuse was that she was very busy. The sushi rolls that I ordered were not made with fresh fish!  I definitely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is overrated. Nice ambient although the hard core house music makes it hard to talk. But more than anything their sushi is very bland. The rice is disgusting, the fish is average. It's not creative and they don't use any sauce. There is no flavor whatsoever. I would never go back."}
{"text":"The sake bombers are a tad overpriced, especially compared to Moira a few streets up. We tend to go later in the night and the bartenders usually seem disinterested and just ready to close up."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and really enjoy it! Love the happy hour too! We really liked the sushi! A lot of great creative rolls. They even have a decent kids menu which is hard to find a sushi joints."}
{"text":"The service is usually pretty awesome. Sushi is alright but it's so damn expensive for what you get sometimes. There's better sushi, but I'm going to be soft because the service was  just that nice."}
{"text":"My wife and I make a point to have a Sushi date nite at least once a month. We decided to come here because of our friends recommendations. Boy, we should get new friends! I mean, would a true friend wait to tell you of a great Sushi place? We had a few rolls along with some fresh, (I do mean fresh), fish. I drank my usual unfiltered variety and she indulged in a few Apple martinis. All in all, everyone was friendly and the food better than normal."}
{"text":"Fabulous sushi!! We love sushi and travel a lot, had sushi in multiple states and very much enjoyed the sushi here. We had the Philly Roll and the Flying Phoenix as well as miso soup and the fried rice. Everything was excellent and very fresh."}
{"text":"Love this place. The kobe burger is amazing. Happy hour is a great deal, ends at 7pm. Only time its not been amazing is when they are super packed from a concert or something but thats understandable."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere.  A nice place for special times or just a casual time.  The food is very creative and there is an abundance of flavors.  The service was very friendly. However,  the only negative was the service was slow and inattentive at times.  Overall, a really good place."}
{"text":"The food was great as always. Cudos to Jacque for her smile and service! Outstanding! It's a great feeling when I don't have to ask for a refill. She was on top of everything and even had some great suggestions. Thanks again! See you again soon!"}
{"text":"It serves its purpose as a trendy, upscale sushi joint. If you're in the mood for that type of environment, it fills the void for that immediate area. It's a social type place that is good for groups, in fact, it was almost entirely filled with other large groups around happy hour.  The HH selection is pretty decent and eclectic (which includes select rolls, starters, and alcohol) and I always appreciate restaurants that have happy hour until 7. One gripe is the small size of the cocktails, ug!  What I tried was not life changing and you're paying for the environment. However, anything in that location (including the now closed Taco Haus), is better than the sub-par Mexican restaurant that operated there for a couple of decades. Everyone in my group was pleased overall. The shopping center is a bit \"hit or miss\" and spotty so time will tell if this will be here to stay. I'd rather be eating at Pure Sushi, but due to its proximity, I'm sure I'll return for happy hour and further explore the menu.  Side Note for my gluten-free homies: They had gluten free soy sauce, which has pretty much become the norm, and the menu indicated which items were gluten free. There were quite a few options!"}
{"text":"Are there for lunch, and was definitely disappointed and left wanting more. Both items we ordered -- the ramen and tuna bowl -- were lacking in flavor and were just bland. Didn't try the sushi, and perhaps that's better, but their cooked items we tried were not good at all. Sushi in Phoenix isn't amazing by any stretch, but this place wasn't nearly as good as I was hoping it would be. To make it worse, our server was really aloof and not around at all, and that's coming from somebody who likes waiters who don't linger around. She didn't really seem to care that I barely touched the ramen, and didn't ask why. Overall I'd avoid this place in favor of the less pretentious options nearby."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Friendly staff! FANTASTIC SUSHI! The Hory Fook was my FAVORITE AND AMAZE-BALLS! The other wraps where great too! The drinks where great! You have to get the Deep Water or the Tune in Tokyo!  It's a pricy place but what sushi place isn't. The bathroom is cool and kinda funny. It's co-ed with separate stalled rooms.. the look on a guys face when he walks in and sees a chic at the sink is funny! Great ladies night out or after work drink place located downtown."}
{"text":"Sushi was eh.... I like to think I am an adventurous sushi eater...but I wasn't even impressed with just the basic spicy tuna roll. I've had better sushi, let's just say that. Establishment was cool, loved the downtown ambiance.   I visited today, on Veterans Day...and being a Veteran, I playfully asked the bartender if there was a free shot for Veterans today, and she simply said No. That may be true...but at least a lil recognition would have been awesome, maybe with a simple cheap lil shot to say Thank you for your service. I could have gone many other places for Veteran treatment but I got None here. #fail."}
{"text":"I absolutely love sushi now because of this place. ASU students who show their Id get free edamame which is awesome because it is delicious. There crab Rangoon are also amazing along with the sauce it is served with. I go to squid ink weekly with ma h different people and no one is ever dissapointed. The sushi is made fresh to order and is DELCIOUS."}
{"text":"Great! Went there for takeout and they lost my order. 5 min later it was perfectly prepared with a 30 percent discount for the short wait. Great edamame and the Dirty Rockstar Roll was delicious. Nice atmosphere on the misted patio for my daughter and I with our Golden Retriever. So glad to have them downtown!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi. I ordered the Ultimate Philly roll and it was everything I could've dreamed of in a roll. Loved it. Plus the Deep Ocean drink was great.  Hit it up for Happy Hour...good selection and prices"}
{"text":"Cool vibe and spot in general. Service was great and friendly. Sushi was just ok though. Shishito peppers were just ok also. Happy hour prices are pretty great. Really can't complain just not excited about the food."}
{"text":"My taste buds are thanking me. I just love the fact that the fish is ordered fresh on a daily basis. As a waitress my standards are very high because I know what some places do to cut-corners. I am extremely impressed with the sushi rolls, the Flying Phoenix Roll and the Tahoe Roll are mind-blowing. Another thing to appreciate is the sushi chefs, Nick was awesome and engaged in conversation with me and my cousin's. He made our food with unsurpassed passion, which to me, makes the food so much better. If you get Nick as your sushi chef, ask him about the dressed-up green tea ice cream, it's to die for."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times during Happy Hour or early dinner hours.. Food was good as was service. Have now gone twice at \"late\" lunch hour and both times service was BAD.. Today it was so bad I walked out without even ordering and they didn't seem to care. Waitress brought my iced tea and menu and then proceeded to join her coworkers behind the sushi bar to hang Christmas stockings. Fifteen minutes later she still hadn't even looked up, let alone come back to refill the tea or take my order. When I got up to leave and said \"you'd think with an empty restaurant you'd find time to wait on customers\" they all looked at me like I was crazy and not one even offered an apology.. just went back to hanging stockings. Hope Santa leaves coal... that's what they've earned. This is my Grand Daughter's favorite place, but I'm not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"Where do I start? We were excited to try the sushi, and we started off by ordering the California rolls, spicy tuna, and Thai chicken rice bowl. As we waited, my dad forgot he wanted a soup, when the waiter comes back, he orders his soup. Then, I hear a song come on the radio and clear as day, \"p***y and f**k come across, there's children all over the restaurant. The music starts to go up in volume, quite loud, and others even start to look around, then it quiets down; this went on throughout our time there. On to the food, my dad starts eating his soup and about two minutes in, A FLY appears, not a fresh, just fallen fly, but a soggy, long drowned fly. The waiter comes, apologizes, removes the soup and gets the manager. The manager doesn't even apologize and says the best she can do is remove the soup from the tab and leaves. We stay in silence.. Shocked. We call her back over, with the same uninterested, rude manner, says nothing; we tell her what we planned on paying for and left. We will never be back to Squid Ink, I can assure you."}
{"text":"After the basketball game we walked into this place without knowing anything about it. We got tuna bowl, chicken teriyaki bowl, spicy tuna roll, avocado roll and miso soup. Everything was very good. The bowls had so many fresh vegetables. Everything was excellent. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here it was delicious. The fried green beans was my fav!! The waitress made the experience so fun."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was a little slow. Seemed a bit overpriced compared to other sushi places. We tried this place out for the first time and will probably stick to our normal spots."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. My friend and I sat at the bar and it was a very nice ambiance. Server was friendly with out being too obnoxious.  A little pricey. I had two house special rolls and a spicy yellowtail and the bill was over forty bucks. Great food though, left happy and stuffed."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! First time I tried Sushi was here, it was their spicy Dirty Rockstar Roll and it was such a treat I order it often. The service here is phenomenal and the bartenders end up being pals by the end of the night. Fast service, I can't believe how quickly my drinks are refilled and love the many choices during Happy Hour. My husband and I go at least twice a week, sometimes more and we will continue to visit. Love Squid!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick bite at lunchtime. The server was fast, friendly, and very professional! My squid & seaweed salads came out fast. I highly recommend this place. Only downside was parking but that's to be expected downtown."}
{"text":"Squid Ink completely surpassed my expectations. The atmosphere  was incredible. The Food was fresh and delicious. A must go when  going downtown and looking for great food in the best location! One of the most epic places downtown!!"}
{"text":"This place is so chill!  Thanks to Ian Ballard, my friend.  He works there and he is bomb chef."}
{"text":"sushi rolls were so small, had 3 and not even a little full. More like an appetiser.  No sapporo,they ran out. Disappointed. won't be coming here again! Oh and service sucked."}
{"text":"Wow what a great place, don't leave without trying the Cougar Roll. This place has a cool vibe and I am sure this place will be hopping for a long time to come."}
{"text":"We frequent this establishment. Always have good service and food. This time however was amazing. Our server was very friendly and outgoing and always ensured we had something to drink. We tried the cougar roll due to others recommending it on yelp - it was the best roll I've had yet. We will be ordering it again as it was quite original and refreshing as well."}
{"text":"In from Illinois and Squid Ink happened to be close to my hotel. I came at the right time given the amazing happy hour specials. Great outdoor seating, lovely bartender, and overall fantastic experience."}
{"text":"Best damn Kobe burger anywhere. Best food, best staff, best location, sky you rock.. Need my fix on those wings also with a side of yellow tail"}
{"text":"Loves this place staff is attentive and sushi was awesome. We eat all sorts of suhi and it was all delicious."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for work and it was hot, hot, hot! We thought some good sushi would be a great idea. It was but unfortunately the A/C was not working properly in the restaurant. The happy hour specials offered good deals and the food was good. We had appetizers, rolls, and sashimi. The service was a little over chatty but I guess some people like that. A descent sushi option in downtown."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  I've been coming here for 5 yrs., usually hang at the bar, and always have a good experience.  Good food + Good service = Good experience."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Arizona from California and have been very disappointed with the sushi quality here. However, this place did not disappoint whatsoever. I may even have to say it's the best sushi I have had EVER!!!! Gasp!   The seafood dynamite roll was aaaaaamazing! They did not skimp on the salmon placed on top or drown it in sauces. And the Pokemon was also delightful. My boyfriend said this place was almost as good as when he was stationed in Japan or Alaska (and that's saying a lot because he is hard to impress when it comes to fish). The crab rangoon was also delish, the sauce with it was the best part.   The wait staff was very pleasant. They even gave us a water to-go because it was hot out.   It is a little pricey but not extremely so consider the quality of the food. Definitely worth the money spent."}
{"text":"First of all it is exciting to have more restaurants in the Lake Pleasant  area. It was 6 o'clock on a Sunday night and I walked in and saw that it was very busy but there were a lot of waiters and waitresses which was a plus! We immediately got two chairs at the bar and served drinks immediately. We ordered the grilled chicken wings for an appetizer... which were absolutely delicious! And they served 12 of them and they had lots of meat on them. I ordered the chicken teriyaki plate with rice. Which was good. To top of our dinner we had some sushi. We had the Philly roll. The sushi was pretty good and big enough to share with two people! During our dinner they opened the TWO BIG windows behind the bar which was nice to have the openness of the summer breeze! The service was friendly and fast.. :)  This place has a great HAPPY HOUR! Daily 3p-6p and nightly after 10p  Specials on well drinks, Saki, and beer 1/2 price appetizers Specials on select sushi rolls  This place is great for families and a place to hang out with friends!  There is indoor and patio seating!"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi! The staff is extremely nice and the manager was very friendly. The restaurant is very clean as well. The caterpillar and rainbow rolls are really good. All taste fresh.  Great location downtown and very spacious."}
{"text":"Awesome place for sushi with a friendly wait staff! Thank you Ashley for your great service and Awesome personality."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi restaurant! Taylor was great on the phone as I made a reservation. Very friendly and courteous. She also happened to be our waitress and was great at making suggestions! Our drinks never went empty as she was always there to refill them. Sushi selection is fresh and the rolls very creative but delicious. Amazing happy hour as well. You can't leave without trying their delicious Hawaiian Bread Pudding. Amazing! Great food, staff, and ambiance. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We use to love this place The service has gone  downhill, quality of the food, and dirty dishes makes for a poor experience. If your just looking to have a beer than your ok"}
{"text":"Happy hour with some friends this evening. Pretty busy for a Thursday night. I waitressed years ago, so not much of a complainer when it comes to service since I'm empathetic to busy waitresses/waiters. However, this was exceptionally slow. After 40 mins of not seeing her, we had to find her to ask her for our checks and 15 mins later, asked another waitress to get her so that she could cash us out. The food was pretty good but the waitress, Sweet Baby (sigh) was a bit clueless."}
{"text":"Great sushi bar. Love the service. We are in there three to four times a month. The service is awesome. My wife left a book there and when we came back in a week or so, the server remembered her and retrieved the book. The server loved the book so much, we let her keep it to read. My kids also love this place too."}
{"text":"One of our first trips out with our new twin boys!  Service and food was excellent.  Went off with out a hitch.  Found a great table away from most of the diners as we had a stroller on the patio.  Super friendly, fast service.  We will be back for sure.  Good menu and happy hour too!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! The location is wonderful and welcoming for business folks from out of town."}
{"text":"Soooo delicious!!!!  We live downtown Phoenix so we decided to stop at squid ink and we're sooooo happy we did! Amazing service, (ask for Molly great waitress and sushi was great and the freshness of the sushi makes this worth the visit.   We had The Agedashi Tofu, Seaweed Salad, The Tahoe, Thai Tofu Fried Rice (tofu for chicken) and THE HAWAII BREAD PUDDING with vanilla bean ice cream THE BEST DESSERT sooooo tasting.  Now remember ask for Molly!!!!!!! Ed & Susan"}
{"text":"We finally tried Squid Ink after wanting to get there for the past few weeks.  I just wish we didn't try it on the night of the Tosh.0 concert... When we got there it was pretty crowded and the hostess told us it would be about 30 minutes.  We told her we'd be at the bar to get a drink while we waited.  After about 5 minutes, one of the bartenders finally acknowledged us and we ordered 2 Hendricks and tonics.  After about another 5 minutes, I asked a different bartender about our drinks and she says, \"oh the Hendricks and tonics, yes coming right up.\"  We got them in pint glasses which I thought was odd because we didn't request tall drinks.  Then she hands us our tab without asking if we'd like to keep it open.  I would give this experience a D and only not an F because we did eventually get a drink. About this time everyone starts leaving for Tosh, so the restaurant and a few open tables.  We waited a few minutes and then went to ask the hostess if our table was ready.  She said she called our name already, but we weren't there so she moved to the next.  Well the waiting area is quite small and we told her we'd be at the bar, so I didn't really understand that. We got seated and ordered.  The server seemed to not really to know the menu, but the food was really great.  Had another miscommunication with a different server about our drink order, but that was okay.  I really want Squid Ink's service to redeem itself because the food is quite good!  I will try again in a few months, but for now will stick with Moira for downtown sushi."}
{"text":"I love this place! The sushi and drinks are amazing and you can't beat the half off sushi and certain drinks during happy hour! Only thing I don't like is they don't serve sushi after midnight......"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! sushi in not usually my cup of tea so it has to be great for me to indulge in it! Squid Ink is one of the best I've ever had!!  Cougar roll, Tahoe Roll, Vegas Roll, Tempura Asparagus Roll, Seaweed Salad, and the chicken wings were all amazing!! the Beignets were a bit hard but still good and hey we didn't come here for fried dough!!  I think i will even get some Squid Ink to go for lunch today!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It should come as no surprise because I am there probably every other week! Squid Ink is not your typical hole-in-the-wall sushi place, it has some serious class.  Hands down, the best sushi I have ever tasted. And I'm not alone in my thoughts on this, I have taken many a friend and the consensus is that this place rocks! Their salmon nigiri - dear god - it's heaven. And a really nice cut, too. Ask them for some fresh wasabi leaves (it's actually pickled but whatever) to put on top instead of the paste you usually get. Way spicier. Way tastier.   Their specialty rolls are fantastic as well - the Tahoe is my personal fav with all sorts of crab stuffed inside and on top too! For something a little lighter I also dig the smoked salmon and jicama. That jicama gives it JUST the right texture. Mmm crispy, crunchy, fresh... holy geez I want one right now!  As far as their other food goes - I always order sushi. But I have had bites of other things and it has all pretty much blown me away. Wait wait, I lied. For brunch one day I did indeed get one of their specials - some little fried rice and kimchi number with an egg on top. The flavors sent my brain spinning!  The bartenders are super attentive and the drinks are good... they have a vanilla and jalapeno martini that I have a hard time resisting. But what can I say, I'm a freak about anything spicy.   The staff here has always been excellent - quick, friendly and might I say rather attractive? Is that allowed here on yelp? And the atmosphere and décor are awesome - all the art is original paintings and it has a rather trendy, chill vibe. They also have these big garage doors that open up to the patio that makes it kind of feel like you're near the beach. Oh and on Tuesday nights they have live music and LIVE PAINTING on the patio!  Live painting? At a restaurant? Sweet! Finally a little culture in Peoria. It's about time."}
{"text":"My girlfriend was in town and we had just gone to a Suns game and I know she loves sushi so I thought lets try Squid Ink.  It was crowded for a Sunday night, but the hostess said it was only a 10-15 minute wait.  I gave her my phone number and she said make sure you answer they only call once.  Understood.  about 20 minutes go by and still no phone call.  I go back to talk to the hostess and meanwhile people who I had not seen waiting around got seated right away.  A woman in front of me mentioned that to the hostess and they gave her some run around how the bar was not open but now it is.  It was then my turn and I asked if my name had been called and she thoughtlessly just said umm.. yes we called you... *pointed to her sheet* see it says \"called.\"  Obviously i see it says called, but I told her that i did not actually receive a phone call.  The hostess just said oh well, we only call once.  Again I understood her, but there was such a lack of customer service and even a lack of offering to say that you'll be next on the list or even an apology.  She then took my number down again and childishly said to make sure i said the number slowly.  After finally getting seated the food was just sub-par.  We started the night with the garlic edamame which was actually pretty good.  But as the rolls came out i was far from impressed.  We ordered the Flying Phoenix and the Zushi \"box roll.\"  The Flying Phoenix had Tuna Tataki which i was looking forward to trying.  Unfortunately the sauce that was on it was way too overpowering and the Tuna was way too peppery.  Call me a snob, but if you can't even taste the true flavor a raw fish then there's something wrong.  2nd was the Zushi \"box roll\" which was supposed to have yellowtail on it.  The \"box\" of rice was quite large underneath what appeared to be a non-existent piece of yellowtail.  The yellowtail was not nearly half the size of the block of rice it was sitting on and having to pay $14 for that was just frustrating and disappointing after the lack of service from the get go.  Needless to say I will not be going back.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to the Squid Ink in Peoria. On the first visit no one in the group (4) ordered sushi and the food verdict was nothing special but worth returning to try some of the other dishes. Hot dishes get  3 stars.  My return to Squid Ink was solo and specifically for the sushi. Patience is required as it took more than 10 minutes for a waitress to show up at the sushi bar and the sushi chefs? were busy visiting with one another.  I ordered hot tea (we are out of hot tea!)(really?), miso soup (tasteless, lukewarm but consumable), seaweed salad (fresh, tasty and and plentiful), octopus (not fresh, dry but  edible, tuna (maguro,fresh, moist and good portion) and squid (strangely served wrapped around carrot slivers and cilantro)(upon request replaced second serving with traditional rice ball). There are no trained sushi chefs at Squid Ink.  No other patrons were at at the sushi bar throughout the 55 minute lunch. None of the \"sushi chefs\" was asian and were visibly uncomfortable discussing the food. This is not a place to experience anything like a traditional Japanese sushi outing."}
{"text":"I lived in Japan & like what they're doing here, a small space used very well w/ fresh fish & solid rice that holds firm... What a great addition to this corner of Scottsdale. The food is spot-on & the patio is perfect for lazy afternoons, yet the walls open to the outside so you can sit at the bar and feel like you're outside anyway.   I ordered the Grilled Squid, Spicy Tuna & Spicy Crab rolls. To my surprise the squid was not breaded at all, but grilled and served w/ a spicy aoili type sauce that is plate-licking good!  The Flying Phoenix is amazing!  Tempura shrimp, spicy crab, avacado, tuna tataki w/ black pepper sauce. Our of this world and like that is named after the staple of this valley. The Spicy Tuna & Spicy Crab rolls or what you would expect from a mixed role but delicious nonetheless.  As a bonus a full, top 100 of 1970's disco flows from the sound system. Bring it!"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I went here when we were in town and they had a great deal on a bottle of wine and sushi for a set price that was very reasonable.  Atmosphere was great, I liked it a lot.  Service was great too.  I honestly can't say anything negative about our experience there.  Will definitely go again next time we r in town"}
{"text":"Very Classy for an Alabama Fan. Roll Tide Very attentive staff. Seaweed salad was great. Citrus yellowtail was yummy"}
{"text":"I rarely if ever eat sushi outside of New York or Los Angeles. I just wanted a light dinner. This was some of the most bland uninspired sushi I have ever had. 0 flavor. I ordered all straight sushi. Maybe my problem was not ordering a f#%* of sauce and bs on my food. A joke outside of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great sushi in Phoenix! Shishito peppers, very fresh yellowtail and tender short ribs. Excellent service in a cool setting. Highly recommend especially for the price!"}
{"text":"Very average experience in regard to actual sushi, and extremely poor experience trying to keep my gluten free fiancé who has celiac from getting poisoned. I will say that our waiter was phenomenal. We went here specifically because they had gluten free options, but what really ended up happening was that our waiter (over and over and over again) had to tell us that basically all of the things labeled gluten free weren't actually gluten free. I'm telling you it happened over 4x that what we ordered we couldn't have. Thank god our waiter was extremely knowledgeable.   Sushi was pretty lame as well. Very very very average. Highly recommend the cocktails though! They were delish!"}
{"text":"Just an update on my experience.   I was contacted right away by someone on yelp with an apology and to contact the GM at a certain email address,  and they would send me a $25 gift certificate.    I sent the first email and never got a reply.  I sent one more follow email 2 weeks later and did receive a reply with about 1 sentence asking for my address.   I sent him my address and nothing was ever sent.   Like I said he before I'm not looking for a hand out so I do not really care that they did not send me anything.  Its still the way it was handled all the way to very end.  Really just got the feeling they wanted to sweep it under the rug and forget about it.   I really enjoy the food squid ink,  but I will not go back to the downtown location again,  I like an aluminum free diet."}
{"text":"Very friendly service! Taylor was fantastic & knew how to sell the specials! Happy Hour options are plentiful & yummy!! Will definitely come back again! Highly recommend the sweet potato fries & flying phoenix roll!"}
{"text":"We stopped by squid inc. during happy hour.  The evening was chilly but the inviting flaming heat lamps were great.  We were also treated to outstanding service by Josie. She recommended a cod appetizer we would not have ordered but were so happy we took her advice. It was melt in your mouth delicious. She also provided recommendations for two great glasses of wine.  Great spot either before or after a movie (Harkin's 14 nearby)."}
{"text":"Honestly the food is great tasting and fresh. I would come back here just for a to go order. Where they lack is in their customer service. The Arizona bs Green Bay football game was playing the evening I visited, they have about two TVs that can be seen from the patio seating outside, in front of those TVs a retractable door, only one door was up while the other was down obstructing the view. Upon arrival I was told moving the door to have a clear view of the TV was not a problem by two different people. However time went and came by and our server who apologize to us stated he could raise the door because someone who works there like the bar tender would get cold. The football finals are here and yes this may not be a sports bar but it use to be a cool hangout place to grab sushi and drinks while watching a game."}
{"text":"The food at Squid Ink is consistently outstanding. But the service has progressively been getting worse and worse. Not too long ago we were eating outside, out of drinks, waiting to order more. The waitress was a few tables away, looking at guests pictures that they were showing her for a good 10 minutes. When my boyfriend expressed that he was a bit upset that she took so long she replied that those people were regulars so she could not just leave.  The time after that, service was a bit slow but the waitress was very nice. When we notifies her that the garlic edamame (our favorite that we order every time)  was so salty that we can't eat it, she offered to \"rinse\" it off for us. I'm not sure how good edamame would taste once it's\"rinsed\" so we declined, still finding the dish on our bill. Yesterday we planned dinner there with friends. We were seated after only 10 minutes. An older couple next to us got up from their table, told the waiter that they are leaving because the waited over 20 minutes, had 2 drinks finished  and still no food. Instead of apologizing the waiter argued with them and made excuses so they left, very upset.  I figured after that scene they would surely take care of us to avoid more upset guests. The waiter walked past us several times, ignored us trying to get his attention and looked away as soon as we made eye contact. Mind you, at this point, there were several empty tables and the restaurant was not as busy as I've experienced before. After 15 minutes of not even putting in a drink order, we also got up and walked out. The hostess tried to avoid conflict, apologized but did nothing to make the situation better. So we went across the street to Doraku were they were so friendly and on top of everything that they made up 100% for the bad experience at Squid Ink. We are torn because the food at Squid Ink is so delicious, but we don't know if we can deal with the lack of service again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. Location is nice. I stopped in last week in late afternoon. I love spicy tuna (usually) so I ordered the Hory Fook Roll to start off with. It was lumpy, loose and completely flavorless. The tempura jalapeños were soggy and really just icky. I ate two of them and the waiter said, \"oh eyes bigger than your stomach, huh !?\" I said no I didn't like it and he just landed the check in front of me and walked away.  Poor execution and poor service.  I will probably try again but they're going to really have to raise the bar."}
{"text":"We ate here on a wed night.  The ramen is HORRIBLE!  The service is HORRIBLE.  The vegetables undercooked , the broth is watery and when told that it was not good the bartender simply walked away.  The bartender provides horrible service if eating in the bar area.  Would most definitely not recommend this restaurant.  Or at least sit on the restaurant side for better service."}
{"text":"I have to say I liked this place overall. I am always skeptical trying new sushi places for fear that I am not going to like anything I order and then pay a fortune for it. A friend and I tried to make the happy hour, but showed up a little late. The menu doesn't have many items on it and there aren't a lot of rolls either, which is a slight disappointment since I like a little variety. But we finally ordered a couple of rolls and some nigiri. We tried the tahoe roll, which I highly recommend and the cougar roll (an odd twist to sushi because it doesn't have any rice in/on it).  The prices were decent, but I wish we would have made it to happy hour. Oh well, maybe next time..."}
{"text":"My husband & I ate at Squid Ink a few weeks ago, and a few times since.  We were very impressed.  The sushi was fresh & delicious.  The service is spot on.  Prices were very reasonable, we highly recommend it. And plan on going back regularly."}
{"text":"Food was good. Atmosphere was good. Live music which was fun. Service was not very good. One of our guests in our party had to wait 30+ mins for her meal-after we all had ours. We waited to start with her but our food was getting cold. Restaurant manager never offered to comp her meal. Young waitress who wasn't very good at accommodating us. She kept saying \"So sorry, your meal will be out soon.\" 30-40 mins later her sushi roll came. They obviously had forgotten."}
{"text":"AWESOME PLACE! Great staff and food. They have an amazing variety of liquor. The fish is on point. The manager karry came by to greet us, and was very chill!  Thanks again, will  be back soon  for sure!"}
{"text":"Luke warm. I ordered take out and got there 5 minutes before the ready time. I immediately paid. The girl asked if I wanted EXACT change back. Too 5 minutes to bring change back and during this whole process I saw a To-go bag on the counter. And of course, a total of 15 minutes being there she picks that Same bag up and hangs it to me. My soup was like warm, rice was cold, and pot stickers were Luke warm as well. Clearly they don't do take out."}
{"text":"I can say without a doubt my favorite sushi place in all of Phoenix and topped off with great service. Has a beautiful woman behind the bar (alicea) that really makes this place shine and keeps me coming back. I highly recommend this place so please come in and see alicea and see what its all about!"}
{"text":"Taylor is awesome! Great service. Great prices. Great food. We got the eel cucumber, California and spicy crab sushi rolls and potstickers. All were delicious!"}
{"text":"Very nice. In for lunch and Roslyn took very good care of me. Sushi was excellent and garlic roasted edamame is an added treat. Very hard working and friendly staff!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Have been a regular at Squid ink in Scottsdale since they opened. Food good service fine but they just raised happy hour prices. Bottle beer domestic used to be $4 $3 on happy hour now $5 all the time. I am local here all year like those slow summer months . Goodbye there are plenty of restaurants in complex who don't rip you off for a bottle of beer."}
{"text":"Small portion for taking out.  I won't come here again if Yogis Grill 2 min away is open."}
{"text":"I need to update this because originally, I was going to come back and downgrade to a 2.   The service seemed to fall by the wayside for the last few months, and we came here out of desperate convenience. Bartenders later at night were too consumed with joking with/flirting with their co-workers and forgetting about us; the food service was slow or often just incorrect; and the fish became less than mediocre (chewy or fishy sometimes).   The last couple of times we noticed that the service is significantly better with certain crews- Friday evenings and week nights. They're prompt, polite, and the quality of fish is now fresh again. I'm docking from a 5 because 1) there's still better sushi out there, and 2) the Saturday afternoon and Sunday evening crew need to step it up. They still seem to allow themselves to get distracted. In comparison, the PV Squid Ink location is better."}
{"text":"Here for lunch with group of 6. Waitress brought 2 miso soups, took a bit of time and brought 2 more, and several minutes later brought the last one. Same with the entrees. Brought out 5, and most of us were half finished before final order arrived. We even asked about it. Waitress very confused and said The last item had just gone in. No apologies, no nothing. Terrible service. So-so food."}
{"text":"So we tried out Squid Inks new Paradise Valley/Scottsdale Location and was not impressed at all. The sushi was extremely poor in quality and taste. Spicy Tuna Roll was nasty, now when a Sushi restaurant can't master Spicy Tuna then they don't deserve to call themselves a Sushi Restaurant IMHO! Another issue is when you order a Shrimp Tempura Roll you expect the Shrimp to be hot Not Cold!! Also whoever came up with the back to back booth setup that they claim will seat 4 really needs to have their Interior Decorator title taken away!!! The only way 4 people could sit there is if they were 4 five year olds. Ooh and when you go to get up the whole table turns and moves soo dumb. The only thing that they have going for them is the service is really good and the food comes out in a timely manner. Also it's a perfect location, the only down fall to the location is the space is small with a big patio and when summer hits that will be an issue. But for me next time I'll just spend my money at a better place until I hear that they have improved their Sushi skills and taste."}
{"text":"Really good and unique sushi. The citrus yellowtail was amazing. The service was a little slow though."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday for Happy Hour on a non-sporting (quiet) downtown evening. Drinks were sub-par; draft Sapporo tasted stale and Manhattan was half-full and weak. Appetizers were not much better; Japanese Fried Chicken tasted strange and Tempura Shrimp was very average. We would have liked to try a few House Rolls as the table next to us ordered them and they looked decent. Friendly service as well, but overall a disappointing HH experience."}
{"text":"Finally, a great Sushi place downtown. Along with the cool trendy atmosphere, Squid Ink provides superb sushi with impeccable service. My favorite item on their menu is definitely the Kobe Burger. Wait, what? A Sushi place known for having a great burger? That's right. Perfectly cooked and placed between Cibatta bread, this burger does wonders for your palate. Very friendly environment and the management is always willing to interact with their guests. Try this place ASAP!"}
{"text":"The sushi is good. the atmosphere is more for younger folks.. 20-30 year olds.  They have a full bar as well."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. In the 6 times I have been here we have only have had 1 mix up with our order and the manager as well as our waitress were quick to make sure they fixed it and made it right. Very friendly waitresses, waiters and the management staff are super friendly, so if you have a complaint do not be scared to speak up because the staff here really do care about your experience. By the way, love the outdoor music as well."}
{"text":"Delicous! Very unique rolls and loved the fresh wasabi.  Prices were high, but if you order off the happy hour menu, than is the usual for sushi around town.  Obviously hip crowd comes later but we were on the early side so no wait. Would go back."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Honestly we have been coming here for a long time. Love the food love the atmosphere but the past few times we have come here it's been the same thing. We waited 20mins for our drinks both times we ordered! Food came before the drinks. One bartender but place wasn't that busy. We noticed her sitting with a group of friends looking at their phone while we were waiting for our drinks. I want to say great things because we do love the food here but I'm tired of the lack of personality of the entire staff and zero sense of customer service. Completely disappointed yet again."}
{"text":"While the location and atmosphere are great, I was generally unimpressed.  The wait was over an hour, and when we were finally seated the service left much to be desired.  The quality of sushi was sub-par, with many of our sashimi pieces tasting a bit questionable.  The drinks were on par, (in regards to both quality and pricing), with other mid to upscale restaurants in the area.   Bottom line: this is your typical Asian-fusion sushi restaurant, enjoy if you're in the area but don't go out of your way to try it out or you may be disappointed."}
{"text":"Let me say it up front... I am not a sushi lover. I tried this place because my husband loves sushi and we live right around the corner. I was thinking I would be filling up on rice, veggies and soy sauce, but I was pleasantly surprised. The Curry shrimp dish with rice was amazing and so satisfying. I have also developed a love for the buffalo roll \"sushi\". I seriously crave it haha! Perfect place for a date night. The cocktail offering is pretty good too. One of the \"classier-night out vibe\" type of places in the area. I also really like being able to see what is going on in the kitchen and the sushi bar seating area offers just that.   Children are welcome, but I personally like to come here kid-free. Again, I can't rate the actual sushi, but my experiences here have always been more than satisfying and I am looking forward to returning again very soon."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Loved the location and all the energy around the restaurant. We were a large group and had great happy hour snacks first. Highly recommend the spicy tuna roles and edamame. The sashimi and speciality roles were lovely. The dirty rockstar role was spicy and had a great kick. Will come back here next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Recommend pot stickers and/or tempura as a starter, and as for sushi- Pokémon and Ravenous rolls seem to be the best (in my opinion). Love this place!"}
{"text":"sushi is ok.  but just ok.  service is bad.  bartender made reference to two girls, one cup loud enough for the whole bar to hear.  waited 40 minutes for togo food.  go right across the street to fresh wasabi."}
{"text":"Really great food and wonderful, friendly, fast service. The filet mignon was flavorful and a wide variety of sushi was fun to choose from!"}
{"text":"Visited Phoenix for a 3 day business trip and had sushi here all 3 days. Food was fresh, service was incredible and the environment was great. Say hello to Amy at the outdoor bar, awesome attitude!"}
{"text":"I went their Sunday 5/29/16 after the comedy show across the street. I got to Squid Ink at 9:30 am and I only ordered one sushi roll and a sashimi plater and one drink. I was left waiting for 50 minutes and only once the water came by and said 30 minutes into my order that my food was on the way. He still did not bring my drink and their were two tables in my section that were seated after me and they got their drinks and food before I got anything. I've been working in the Food and Beverage and Restaurant Industry for over 25 years and the service here was terrible. I will never recommend anyone to go eat at Squid Ink and don't know how this place stays in business with such terrible customer service. And for those looking for good service I recommend the comedy club, my waitress had a full section the entire place was packed and it only took one minute after I was seated for the waitress to come by and take my order; and my drinks showed up a few minutes later. I highly recommend the staff at Squid Ink go over to the Comedy Club and see what real customer service really is. Thanks Comedy Club for a great night and two thumbs down for Squid Ink for their lousy service."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and have some pretty good deals! We had 2 appetizers, green bean tempura and the beef negimaki. Green beans were good the beef was not good I am glad it was half off because it is a $12 app. You get 6 very small pieces of beef with no flavor, very bland! We ordered 3 happy hour rolls! Spicy tuna, buffalo chicken and the hory fook. All just average. We also ordered Thai chicken fried rice and ramen. Both very bland and not a lot of flavor! I would probably not order from the kitchen menu again! I will stick to rolls.   The atmosphere was good. Thursday night was super busy! Drinks were good but pricy after happy hour. The best part was the entertainment. Marty and Natalie performed and they were fantastic. I hope they bring them back because they were great! It was so pretty outside and good music! I give the performers a 5!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place while looking for a place to eat before going to a D-backs game.  After eating here, I'm not sure why anyone settles for the so-so looking pub food offered at the eateries that are closer to the stadium.  If I can walk three blocks in 106 degree heat, anyone can!  So, I got there in time for Happy Hour.  Because of this, the seats at the bar inside were all taken, so they rolled up a window and offered me an outdoor spot.  I wasn't sure I'd be comfortable there (did I mention the temperature was 106 degrees?) but the area was in the shade, so it was quite pleasant and I stayed.  And I am so glad I did: for about $22 (including tip), I got fourteen pieces of delicious sushi (California rolls and spicy salmon rolls) and three tasty drinks.  If my travels take me back in Phoenix, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time after reading decent reviews here. It was average. I wouldn't drive far to go there but the rolls were fine and the atmosphere was nice. Our service was sub-par as she never checked in with us and forgot that we ordered the garlic edamame which is the only thing I heard great reviews about.  We had the special Indulgence roll, Vegas roll, Cougar, Philly Roll and the Phoenix. All were pretty good."}
{"text":"Lunch downtown... Sushi took 45 minutes to arrive, didn't taste fresh at all. My friend's order never arrived because apparently she ordered a summer sushi that's only available at dinner but the sign at the door didn't indicate this nor did the waitress tell her. My friend ordered another sushi plate which was slow to arrive.  They were not busy...   Our server was nice and apologized; however, another server was rude. We asked for a manager; however, there was not one onsite.   We work downtown and have a lot of options. Definitely not returning."}
{"text":"Service is great! Food not so great!  Sashimi looks a lot smaller than the picture! Customer service is great!"}
{"text":"Number one they use crab stick instead of chopping up crab stick to make it look somewhat authentic. Number two when they serve wrong order they try to give it to the right order after someone else has already touched it. Let's expand on that when there's only 4 people at a bar and you can't even remember what one person orders, there's a problem. The best thing on their menu is the chicken wings, for a sushi restaurant that's a problem. Please Peoria, get a better sushi restaurant in town"}
{"text":"Great sushi after a Suns game - dollar beer promotions for Stellas!  Wonderful, interesting rolls presented artistically.  They also serve teriyaki bowls which were good as well."}
{"text":"Amazing !!! Especially the happy hour and sake!! Great servers also!! Only place I found in the valley that has PEI mussels."}
{"text":"This place is a GREAT place to go for sushi! Now, I'm not usually a sushi fan, but I came here because my boyfriend is an avid sushi lover, and I thought that it would be a great place for a date night.  He was blown away by the unique rolls, the quality of fish, and the great prices as well! We had such a fun time and enjoyed it all - especially the surf and turf roll! I also loved the Tahoe roll. It has crush macadamia nuts on top.  The service is just as great as the food. We enjoyed everyone working there, and especially enjoyed speaking with the manager, Carrie. She was very professional, laid back, and easy to talk to.   Not only will we be back to stuff our faces with sushi again, but we'll be back for the service as well!"}
{"text":"On a Sunday night after the Saboten Con. Some friends and I went to Squid Ink for some sushi. There was a 15 min wait for a table and while waiting we looked through the menu and everything looks good. When we were seated it took awhile for our waiter to get to use to get our drink orders. After getting our drink order it took him awhile to get us our drinks. Seeing that service was pretty slow we decided to put our order in right away. I ordered the seaweed salad, chef special ramen and the spicy tuna. My friends ordered the assorted sushi platter and spicy vegetable udon. I got my seaweed salad and it tasted like every other seaweed salad I've had. When I got my ramen I was excited to try it but I was disappointed. The broth had no flavor at all. I had to keep adding soy sauce but it was lacking salt. The noodles tasted like they came from a Shin ramyun packet. When I got my spicy tuna the same tasteless theme continued. The rice was very plain lacking of flavor and the tune was just spicy with no flavor. My friends didn't like there dishes either. My friend didn't like his platter saying it was flavorless. My other friends udon said it was very sweet and not spicy at all.   Overall our experience was pretty bad. The slow service and lack of flavor in the food we will probably go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Me and my friend came in from Washington and we're looking for some sushi. We came across this place by looking on Yelp! and decided to try it. We ended up sitting in the bar and lucky for us it was happy hour. I loved the fact they had 6 dollar 40 oz. sake bombers. Can we say Awesome!  For food we ordered the Dirty Rockstar Roll, the Hory Fook Roll, and split a dessert of Hawaiin Bread Pudding.  The service was amazing and the atmosphere was a lot of fun yet classy.  If I am ever in Arizona I will for sure be back again."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a million stars! This is my favorite spot in downtown Phoenix. Kate and Brian are the best bartenders I've ever encountered. The food here is awesome! My favorite thing on the menu is the chicken n' veggies. My boyfriend says that the wings here are his favorite from anywhere! You can really tell they love their customers. We both highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Always eat at the bar here with the Mrs. We love it. Amanda and Pete never steer us wrong . Freshest sushi in the desert and the spicy garlic edamame cannot be replicated. We've tried at home and with other restaurants it seems simple enough but we guess not ! So happy to finally leave these guys a review."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar..overall setting was nice. Price was decent...$25 or so for big plate of sashimi chef's choice. Quality and taste was average thus the 3 stars. Not bad if u need a sushi fix like we that night."}
{"text":"In town for a convention from Boston.  Came here last not for drinks and sushi and it was so delicious! Decided to come again today for lunch with friends! Highly recommend if you're in phoenix!"}
{"text":"For Arizona it does not get better than this sushi place. Staff is great and so is the fish. Awesome atmosphere and great job"}
{"text":"i was reluctant, to put up any stars but after EEK Methinks not, I couldn't resist the star.  It was like a box of crayons, plenty of color but everything tasted the same.  I was ok with the service and atmosphere, but the sushi was NOT SUSHI.  We had a  soft shell crab hand roll with softshell crab & glop of imitation crab to the side of it.  YUCK!!! Who would do this.  The seafood dynamite roll was a roll of imitation.  Tuna roll, was ground tuna.  Everything very bland...........no mention on menu that that the fish would be fake.  There was a warning for people with compromised immune system or pregnancy.  It should just say if Human you won't like.  Sorry to say but EEEEEk Methinks not well of this place.  $72.00 lunch was bowl of miso, seaweed salad two crab hand rolls one dynamite roll, one tuna roll and 1 order nigiri yellow tail. Ouch to the wallet and ouch to the belly."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from where i was staying at the palomar.  I liked how the bar was basically just walk up from the sidewalk.  I kept is pretty basic with an order of seaweed salad, shasihmi, and rockstar roll.   Make sure you ask how hot the jalapeños are.  Apparently the slices on my roll were hotter than usual.   I saw a lot of yelpers complain about the service but I had no issues but it was a slower Monday night."}
{"text":"Great Food... Stopped for lunch at Squid Ink for sushi. The service and food was great."}
{"text":"Nice place...we usually eat at the sushi bar.  Great sushi....We come here quite a bit and have always had great service. The regular bar area is always crowded.  A big happy hour crowd.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place has average sushi,  although the Cougar Rolls are very different and delicious. The service here is always just okay.   Make sure you don't sit by the windows here - you will be pestered by fruit flies your entire meal. This place has tons of them and it is disgusting. They are the worst in the corner window seats. I wish this place would do something about them..."}
{"text":"Place was awesome. Extremely friendly staff. Our waitress took a lot of time explaining the menu, asking questions and making suggestions. The sushi was excellent. The ingredients were high quality and fresh. The atmosphere was great. Great music and decor. Highly suggest the Tsunami roll. If you like heat, the Rock Star roll is a must. This is our new go to sushi place."}
{"text":"Oh my,  first off let me start by saying how much it saddens me to write this review!  I really wanted to love this place.  Maybe it was an off night when we went last weekend, but man were lots of things \"off\".  All of the tables outside on the south side (behind the bar) are sitting on slanted slab.  So when anyone orders any food (especially with sauces) it all leans up to the very edge of the plate it's on.  Staff in a hurry will pick these plates up haphazardly and then the sauce spills onto the table, chairs and then eventually you.  Honest mistake and not a big deal in our case, but how many times does this happen??    Now the food.  I'm sorry to say but our sushi was NOT good.  Some of the rolls had potential but they were ruined (for my taste) with cucumber wraps or weak ingredient combos.   The uni was not fresh.  Luckily the market price was only $4, so I was relieved I wasn't charged and arm and a leg for it.  Also, we had to ask for wasabi and ginger twice. Our sushi plates did not have any.  Now for the highlights:  The garlic edamame, pot stickers and miso cod were great!  Perfectly prepared - especially the cod!   The service was great, too!  Lots of nice people walking around making sure we were doing ok.  Really appreciated their positive spirit here.  Makes for a pleasant evening for sure.    Again, I'm really hoping it was an off night, but it was really hard spending over $100 for two people (no drinks) on low grade food and nerve wracking outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great happy hour. Great bartenders. All starters half off during happy hour! Try the chicken wings and the grilled squid, both delicious. Great atmosphere and beautiful bar."}
{"text":"The management here needs to have a serious talk with the hostesses about their customer service.. I have ordered take out here 3 times and every time the hostesses are rude and act like they don't want to be there. They never have a smile, act like it's an inconvenience to help you, and never even bother to say goodbye when you leave. For a high-end sushi restaurant the service is worse than a McDonald's. Today when we went to the host stand to pick up our food they told us coldly to go over to the bar to get it which was completely crowded and loud. I didn't really want to holler across the bar to get my order.. We told them we would prefer to sit and wait for our food. We sat down for 2 minutes and the hostess then stomped over with our food and didn't say a word as we signed our bill, clearly irritated. The food may be great but unfortunately the service makes me not want to come back, especially since it isn't cheap."}
{"text":"The fish is good but the rice is subpar.  Price/value wise you're paying a bit of a premium for the location.  For sushi in downtown Phoenix, Harumi is still the best."}
{"text":"Great Sushi Bar! The customer service is second to none. They have rice dishes and inexpensive happy hour prices with a diverse happy hour menu. Its downtown right in the thick of things! Not going to find anything close with a similar price point."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I stopped in for some sushi. They had a fun happy hour menu which included discounts on food as well as drinks. FYI, Happy? Hour runs until 7 PM. We ordered a California Roll, a Spicy Tuna Roll, and some Pork Pot Stickers. The rolls were spot on and the Pot Stickers were some of the best I've ever had. We enjoyed everything so much that we ordered one of their specialty rolls - I think it was call the dynamite seafood roll, but don't hold me to that. When it came out it was a roll covered in chunks of different seafood including squid, salmon, and a few other things. Then the whole thing was covered in some special sauce they created. It was really yummy. Honestly, I would have given this 5 stars, but our server was beyond slow. Everything took forever! I know sushi normally takes time, but we really thought he had forgotten us. Our drinks sat empty, we had to flag him down for water, and I literally had to wave to him to get a bill. Hopefully, he was just having a distracted night."}
{"text":"Terrible service... our waitress was practically ignoring us and she only had 3 tables! One star might be harsh yeah but I wont be spending that kind of money on a place this this again."}
{"text":"Yum! I had delicious sushi, nice atmosphere and friendly server. We will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Happy hour deals are good. Atmosphere is good, especially when they have live music. Both the inside and patio seating are good. The food is good, but nothing amazing to the point that I HAVE to go back asap. Great restaurant for switching up your dining out options."}
{"text":"We sat outside in the bar as the heat lamps were perfect with the weather. I ordered the special drink for the night the ginger tini and it was crisp and refreshing. I ordered the Ramen and my friend ordered the curry chicken. We both enjoyed our meals as they were cooked perfect, portioned perfect and tasted wonderful. We enjoyed the atmosphere and the bartenders were friendly and helpful with suggestions on what would be good to order. I  recommend this place and enjoyed my time here."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this location better than the west valley location.  Sushi was great at both places!  I would recommend squid ink.  We love the dragon roll and salmon nigiri."}
{"text":"Tried their chef sushi plate and Uni sushi.  Reasonably priced considering everything must be jetted in.  Sushi was actually good and the service quite friendly.  I was worried the sushi plate may not be enough for dinner.  But the sushi plate came with a bunch of filler california roll in addition to 7 Nigiri pieces so it can definitely fill a hungry person up.  The Uni was very fresh and tasted sweet.  In general, a good place for sushi in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Brian the bartender is great go with his suggestions sit at the outside bar have happy hour and chill He will do all the work Great beer on draft"}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices and a wide selection of sushi.  Highly recommend as long as you go on happy hour otherwise it can be pricey."}
{"text":"I love the buffalo chicken and surf and turf rolls here. However, because of the poor customer service I think I will have to stop giving Squid Ink my business. Eating in is all always poor service and when I try to call in an order for pick up no-one answers the phone! I just called the dtphx location at 6:41pm and no-one answered. This has happened before. I guess I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"We have been a few times and food is usually decent. I love the tempura green beans! However, the service has always been really bad. They take a while to take the order then they don't come back to the table to check if anything is needed. Not very busy when we can see the servers just talking and hanging out. Service can really make or break a place so hopefully management can get a better handle on it."}
{"text":"OH DID I WALKED INTO HOOTERS!! The food is great here, DESPICABLE I had to witness the CLICKY group at the bar having personal time and getting their hair into the food, waitresses showing their boobs...is so degrading to use it as part of your business model...Specially bringing my kids!! Will not come back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Good rolls and excellent service.  Nicole maintained her upbeat and charming service for as long as we remained. Live music Thursday made it a perfect find."}
{"text":"The server was new but he made sure everything was perfect for us! The food was really good and was delivered to us reasonably fast! I would definately go here again for sushi."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a very busy pre Jimmy Buffet party there at Phx Cityscape. We sat at the bar and had a few drinks and food and watched the Parrotheads parading about. Great location. They have Happy Hour Pricing on multiple drinks and food items.   We tried the spicy yellowtail roll and were pleasantly surprised how good it was. The next item was a pan seared butterfish that was amazing. It was moist and delicious and served on a bed of roasted asparagus with a light sauce.  We were impressed with how they handled a large raucuous crowd with aplomb and kept it festive. We will definitely return. Love the late night hours too!"}
{"text":"The food is great and all day happy hour on Sunday is great during football season! The only reason they don't get 5 stars is that the service is hit or miss. However the food is worth it. Kobe burger and sweet potato fries are the best!"}
{"text":"Squid Ink has fresh, quality fish and unique rolls.  As someone who prefers more simple sushi (mainly nigiri and not a lot of special sauces), I thought the taste and texture of the salmon and tuna was very good overall.  The special rolls are not what you typically find at sushi restaurants out here and (thankfully) not so huge that you can hardly eat them.  While not my favorite restaurant, it's definitely a nice addition to the Peoria area.  The service is great and the drink selection is also a bit out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Strolled in for a later lunch,  great food,  soooo service.  Kinda bummed for a first timer.  Maybe it was the heat warning."}
{"text":"Good Asian Fusion concepts! But executed in a way that doesn't allow for fish to be the focal point of the dish. Heavy grease, over kill spice & sappy sweet detracted from a clean sushi experience. Great contemporary decor & nice service! But not my choice for sushi in this town."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. After we were seated took almost 10 minutes to get serviced by our waiter. He never brought us any waters, worse part was the table next to us got seated after us and had waters and apps before we got anything.  Our appetizer was forgotten, which happens but because the waiter never came to our table, so we didn't end up getting it until we were done with it whole meal.   At one point we had been sitting for almost 20 minutes so ignored that another waitress came and told that we would be helped soon."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. The sushi and appetizers were better than I expected. Great atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place and was disappointed.  The service and sushi were mediocre. The rice was hard so it made the entire roll not so good. I ordered the tootsie roll and the vegas roll. I think if the rice wasn't hard the tootsie roll would of been perfect. The vegas roll was just okay, I've had it better at other places. Luckily it was happy hour and the tootsie roll was $7 and the vegas was $9. We also ordered pot stickers and they were soggy because they automatically put the sauce on it. They should put the sauce on the side and you can decide whether or not you want to dip it. This will make the potsticker not soggy. The service wasn't that good. Took over 5 min for someone just to ask for our drink order and it was DEAD. There were literally 5 people on the entire restaurant.  Overall, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Expensive but nothing special. Sushi tempura was cold. Ordered the hory fook roll which was supposed to have crispy tempura jalapeño and shrimp. It was soggy and cold"}
{"text":"Cool vibe. I got a couple of rolls to go and they were both very fresh and tasty... I've had better but had much worse..."}
{"text":"We really like this place. Amazing happy hour prices, nice atmosphere and good tasting sushi that has never been anything but fresh for us. They have everything from the regular California rolls all the way to the decked out rolls and everyone we have tried has been really good. Service has been a little iffy a few times we have gone but this is my only complaint."}
{"text":"This review is for the ramen. I should have known better than to order ramen in Phoenix, especially being accustomed to world class ramen in SF, Japan, and Hawaii.   But I thought, how bad could it be? I'll tell you that package ramen, a cup of noodles, anything was better than what they served.  They said today's ramen was pork brisket, I said alright. But that ramen was confused! The broth was blegh, salty with this egginess from the noodles. Three HUGE pork brisket cuts... I was expecting something like tonkatsu, but sadly no. Then, there was spinach leaves, way too much, as if I were gonna have a ramen salad. The eggs weren't even tea boiled, and to top it all off there were several logs of imitation crab. What?! Just... what?!  I couldn't finish it.  My server was friendly and nice, but that ramen was by the far the worst ramen I've had in my entire life."}
{"text":"I have been to Squid Ink several times for lunch & I've always been ultra satisfied. The food is excellent, service remarkable, atmosphere perfect. Indoor/outdoor bar is great even in hotter temps is a fun place, craft beers & a Kobe burger to die for!"}
{"text":"The sushi wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. The waitress was really friendly, but outside of that - we were not impressed. Even the beer wasn't ice cold. The atmosphere was okay, but trendy. This is a sushi bar for those who visit sushi, but not those who live it."}
{"text":"I've been several more times since my first review and just had their grilled chicken wings for the first time.  At happy hour (daily until 7) they are half off so only 4 or 5 bucks for a dozen.  They were EXCELLENT.  Still stand by Sakana being by far the go-to spot on the west side for sushi."}
{"text":"I know this place is new so I will give them another chance but I have been twice and had not great service.  The first time we went for dinner and received our meals before our starters and the waiter did not even realize we never received them.  He did take one off the bill which was nice.  They then charged by boyfriends card double which took about a week to get the charges reversed.    My second visit was for lunch with a group of girlfriends and the experience was worse.  We all received our food at different times and the lost my order and one other girls order.  They did not even serve our soups at the same time, when we asked why they waitress said they were washing more bowl.  We found this very odd being that it was a weekday lunch with about 10 people in the entire place.    The food was good.  The tuna lunch bowl was really good.  Be careful if you don't like spicy because the food is spicy.  For me thats a good thing.  I love close and I am excited about the place so I hope they get the kinks worked out.  The dumplings were Yum!   Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"In town for weekend conference and not particularly expecting much. The pork belly udon was amazing and the service was great from all staff. Brian and Tristan are an engaging and friendly duo."}
{"text":"Sushi and beer tasted fine - happy hour prices weren't honored. We were charged $36 on a meal that should have been $25.  After showing the price difference to the staff, and agreeing that we were over charged by $10, we were given $5 back. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Lives here for three years before trying it and now I'm a regular! The edamame, pot stickers and rangoons are divine. SO much more than just sushi!"}
{"text":"Dirty rock star roll is the BOMB! sushi is extremely fresh. Highly recommend. During our 7 day vacation...we went 3 times!"}
{"text":"A great late night option for those who don't want to take the car out of the pre-paid parking lot near their hotel/convention center, downtown Phoenix.  I'll admit we went there just to get the Yelp deal (50% off draught beer), but it turned out to be an awesome dining experience. Out for drinks morphed into full-fledged late-night meal.   The service was great). Very attentive, friendly (but not pushy), and knowledgeable  (in spite of our server being new there).  The food was wonderful. We had a party of 4 and ordered a variety dishes and rolls, none of which disappointed. Dragon Roll is especially delicious. And we HAD to try the Tootsie roll (just because) and it turned out to be surprisingly yummy and not just a cute name!  Their selections of cold sake are come sable too (tho I can't possibly remember which ones we had)... The details are fuzzy now... But that is a GOOD sign when it comes to the quality of the alcoholic beverages, doesn't it?!  Overall, I highly recommend this place ANY time of the day, but for SURE as a fantastic late option."}
{"text":"It's a pretty great place overall, but I'll break it down and review specific areas.  First, the rolls.  They're not only really good, but they have some really unique combinations that I haven't seen elsewhere; I'm always up for something new, so that's a huge bonus for me.  Second, the sashimi.  This is the primary reason that I rated them as low as I did.  I usually go to Sakana for sashimi, and it's so fresh there that all but one of my kids eat it with me.  None of them would eat it here; they spit it out on their plates, and even I had to use wasabi and soy sauce when I usually scarf mine down plain.  Third, and related to the second, is the price.  You're definitely paying for the atmosphere, because the quality (especially the fish as I pointed out) isn't worth paying twice what some other places charge.  Speaking of atmosphere, it's great.  Very modern and trendy, lots of great art and very sleek decor.  Also, the location is good for me because I live in the middle of nowhere, but if you don't live out here, it's quite a hike for many of you, way up in north Peoria.  Finally, ending on another high note, the green tea ice cream is great.  It's a huge portion, capable of being shared, and has sweet wonton crunchies.  Only one of my boys usually eats it elsewhere, but at Squid Ink, all three jumped in and it was gone in less than a minute.  And if your kids don't like sushi, they have some fun non-fish options, including a rolled piece of bread with peanut butter they can dip in raspberry sauce, so it makes them feel like they're eating a grown-up roll but it's actually just a nouveau PB&J."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite, was taken care of very well by the entire staff, clean and tasty, and just what I needed. Great happy hour worth checking out- everyone from the host to the chef was super nice- thank you"}
{"text":"This review is for lunch. I know it looks like a hip place for happy hour, so maybe that's their niche, because lunch isn't it.   I had the lunch platter. It was $12 for a bowl of miso dumpling soup, which I enjoyed, and a basic roll and four pieces of assorted nigiri. It just wasn't a good value. $12 for that much sushi would be cool if it was better than pre-packaged grocery store rolls, but it wasn't. It was incredibly ordinary."}
{"text":"So I've always, always been lucky & got seats at the bar which at this location I like because it looks over the street. So there's lots of foot traffic to be entertained with. Which is always fun on the weekends. No telling who's going to walk by doing what. The bar staff has never been the same staff & the last guy that was working the bar the weekend of 1/9 during the Broncos/Steelers championship was a TOTAL douche. Made a big diff with his \"buddies\" than the rest of us at the bar. It was so bad that the next time my hubs wanted sushi in downtown the following Sat before 5 I didn't want to go here because of him. But our choices were limited to one so there you go. I was just hoping he wasn't going to be there & true to form the staff tending the bar was diff. YAY! The girl was from the now defunct Scottsdale location & was fun, personable & couldn't have been further from a douche. But that goes to show you no matter how yummy just one bad personal experience can turn you off. Just saying.... We got a new roll to us, the Seafood Dynamite & weren't fans because we don't dig warm anything on our cool sushi roll but the taste was very good. Just us. If you don't mind warm cooked fish as sushi go for it. It was very good. We are just  more sashimi folks. We keep coming back because all of the sushi, Nigiri & Sashimi is very fresh, tasty & delish. The Spicy Tuna is usually heavy handed on the spice which I REALLY like. But beware if you don't.  Also yum-my is the: tuna sashimi, octopus sashimi, caterpillar roll, shrimp tempura roll, cougar rolls but the roasted squid & roasted garlic edamame app are both divine. So good must get. :)"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The restaurant decor and atmosphere was relaxed and hip. I liked the different painting shown by a local artist. The sushi was great, we had happy hour rolls and a house roll called \"dirty rockstar\" and it was amazing! Great flavors, not as spicy as I was hoping for since it has habanero peppers in it. Our waitress was fantastic. She made sure we had sake and beer for our sake bombs and snacks when we needed them. Highly recommend Squid Ink!"}
{"text":"Tried Squid Ink today for the first time.  The interior and atmosphere was nice - hip, modern, fresh feeling.  Service was a bit iffy (though I think they may have had some new staff there still learning the ropes).  No one up front to seat me when I walked in so I seated myself.  When the sushi arrived we didn't have chopsticks, plates, napkins - I had to walk up front and get them myself.  The food was...ok.  Nothing really stood out about it.  I tried 3 different rolls and they were all pretty good...not bad, but not GREAT either.  Pricing wasn't too bad...3 rolls and edamame for like $45.  I would try it again as it seemed like kind of a cool, swanky place to hang out, but I'll be going in with tempered expectations."}
{"text":"Really good Happy Hour specials.  The garlic edemame is delicious!  Sushi was good too.  We've only been during happy hour."}
{"text":"The food here is good. The waitstaff....look. I get it. You are trying to be hip and cool with the hot chicks. This is fine. But every time Ive been in, Ive been served by some chick who looks rode hard and dressed a step above streetwalker, in amount and class of clothing. For a place that is trying to be slick and trendy, you think they would want their waitstaff dressing with some class...not faded, too small black leggings and a ratty, faded, worn out tank top with gym shoes that look like they could walk themselves. It is really off putting."}
{"text":"Solid sushi establishment. Good sushi, good service, awesome Sunday happy hour specials, and a unique atmosphere.  I've definitely had better sushi before, but this place definitely deserves credit for fresh and tasty sushi. The two rolls I tried (Philly Roll & Spicy Salmon Roll) were good and totally worth what I paid. Philly Roll was a little heavy on the cream cheese, but they both tasted really fresh, which is always a definite plus at sushi restaurants. I also tried the pot stickers. Presentation was a five - they looked amazing - but, again, they weren't the best I've had and they had much thicker dough than what I prefer.  A negative I had with this place was that the seating outside is actually right next to all of the people walking on the sidewalk, and the table heights put you directly at the height of the people waking by. Weirdly, three guys came up to our table while we were talking & eating and stopped to talk about their beliefs for what was probably five minutes. It was uncomfortable and a weird situation, and the waiter didn't come to distract us so they'd stop talking. (Not sure if he should have or what could have been done to prevent this, but it was uncomfortable and didn't really leave me in a good spot with the layout of the place and ability to be in a private, date-night setting.)  Still overall great service and good sushi. Would likely return if I was in the area, but would probably try to sit inside."}
{"text":"Miso soup is loaded with mushrooms and tofu, it has a peppery taste. It was very good. Sushi was good! We had the Pokemon roll and a lunch combo."}
{"text":"To say that the food was mediocre would be generous with my syllables.  The location is great and the service was good but if you going here for the food turn around and throw a dart and I can promise you will hit a place that will be better for both your stomach and your wallet.   I am more than happy to pay for great, even good sushi but good is my cutoff.  Not a good sign when the bread pudding is your best offering. Btw, the bread pudding is yummy!!"}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been here and the second time they forgot my order and my party all received there food while I waited. So dissapointing as both those times I asked and they blatantly didn't make the food so I just canceled and was not comped any type of service to my party. Just two bad experiences out of three. Disappointing because the food that I had was good but doesn't seem worth it."}
{"text":"great sushi and great service! highly recommend the buffalo chicken roll and the tootsie roll"}
{"text":"All day Happy Hour on Sundays.  Sunday Funday?  Hello!  Why yes!  I hardly ever hang out in Downtown Phoenix, hardly ever but when I do it's to visit Squid Ink on a Sunday for happy hour or Stand Up Live.  The prices are awesome and the Happy Hour prices are even better.  When it's nice outside, be sure to sit outside and people watch while enjoying Happy Hour.  Trust me!"}
{"text":"Such a treat to have awesome variety of cocktails AND sushi. We popped in here on a whim after reading the Yelp reviews and were thrilled. Hip decor. Happy, personal staff. Absolutely will come back when I'm in town next."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite to eat the other night and bellied up at the bar. I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir, dumplings, black cod and some tempura fried green beans, all very good.   Server was good and the atmosphere with the open air bar was comfortable and relaxing."}
{"text":"Its not bad but I've had better. This place is definitely pricey the minimum you will spent is $8 and that is just an appetizer. The sushi tasted really fresh but my issue is that they use way too much rice on both the nigiri style and the rolls. Service was decent the waiter was decent, he was quick but never asked if we wanted refills on water. The cleaning service was even quicker, some friends had gotten up to for a smoke and before we even noticed they had cleaned up their unfinished beers and sake. Happened once and almost happened a second time."}
{"text":"What an excellent sushi joint. From the great service and decor to the amazingly fresh and top-quality sushi, SquidInk does not disappoint. There are very few sushi places where everything comes together like it does at SquidInk, so I will be back time and time again. Great bar atmosphere too!  Try the rockstar roll and thank me later."}
{"text":"As much as I really love the food...disappointed in the service the past couple of visits. I appreciate that people who work together get along well & the people are friendly ..however, more importantly & the whole reason you are there is to serve the customer. We are the reason. Please pay attention. It matters.  Upon being seated by our host...that was it. As three employees were standing at the front chit chatting I had to get up & request water. YES i had to ask for water. We ordered our food which was delicious. Dirty Rockstar was perfectly  spicy.  But again service lacking. Part of the problem is the style of how employees are  catagorized.  servers only serve. Bussers only buss. Host only seats. When it's busy...everyone needs to step in & help out.  It's just the nature of the  business. This seems to be a management issue. As I always say.. my whole reason to go out is to get good service along with good food. Otherwise I can stay home & eat. Sorry to take a star awsy."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty descent. It's pretty hard to mess up a California roll. However, my friend mentioned several times to the waiter that she was vegan and she still ended up with cream cheese in her food. The server disappeared for a long time and not even the hostess could find him. Average sushi, with crap service."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our first experience here. The waiter was super friendly and helpful. He made sure to let us know that Happy hour was about to end and if we knew what we wanted he could put it in so we could get happy hour pricing.   We got the Buffalo Chicken Roll and the Surf and Turf Roll. I wanted to try the Buffalo Chicken roll just because it sounded different- It was good. But the Surf and Turf Roll-OMG it was delicious.  All the specialty rolls sounded so good i'm excited to go back and try some more."}
{"text":"Very good sushi. I had tai (lightly sauced by the chef), and maguro nigiri. The negihama roll was also very good. I wanted saba but was told the chef didn't like today's fish so instead I had sea scallops (which should ne hotate but turned they out to be bay scallops).  The egg in the tonkatsu ramen was probably the best part of the dish. The broth was almost inky; very unusual. Even though it was dark it didn't have the typical rich, deep flavor. The pork, of which there was a generous amount, was either grilled or pan fried. Different but good."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite sushi place I have gone to in Phoenix. The sushi rolls are the right size. So many places make them way too big. Their happy hour menu is amazing. I highly suggest trying to go during their happy hour. They have great deals on food and drinks. If you don't go during happy hour it can get a bit spendy. This place usually requires a reservation if you are coming for dinner hours and I can see why. Space is limited. They did a good job with what they have. If you don't have a reservation expect to wait. The only con in my opinion is that the menu had no description of what the rolls were. I had to ask the waiter. That's a minor inconvenience though."}
{"text":"My visit might be biased because I just had a great time here. 3-7pm happy hour 1/2 off starters, drinks, and certain shusi rolls. The place was empty the service was amazing and the char broiled squid was fantastic even though I'm not a fan of squid."}
{"text":"Wow, impressive Cityscape!! What a nice sushi joint in downtown! The layout is very nice, super urban. We started with a seared beef appetizer with a mustard sauce that was pretty good. We also split a crazy Philly roll that was out of this world, and another roll with black cod and strawberry. I thought the fish was very fresh, well prepared and very well priced. they even had kids sushi rolls on the menu for the little ones, awesome!  Now the service was clunky, but it's new so I'll give them a bit of a break. The server didn't really have much of a handle on when the food was coming out, was confused about some of the drink ordering (we ordered a large beer and a hot sake and got a small beer and a half filled little sake container..with no sake glasses).   We also  ordered the beignets, which I found heavy but they were okay. All in all, i'll for sure be back. Solid 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Great service!! Gotta love the industry perks! Monday's and Tuesday's are the best nights!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for some sashimi last night, and when I read that Squid Ink is open until midnight during the week, we decided to give it a try right that second! Upon entering, my husband and I were warmly greeted and we took our seats at the bar. The bartender, Asia, was helpful in explaining the menu and the drink options to us. We settled on the tuna sashimi, salmon sashimi, and the spicy tuna roll. Everything we had was really delicious, and we were pleasantly surprised by the sashimi portions....6 LARGE pieces of the most succulent sashimi I've ever had for about $11. I felt like it was pretty reasonably priced for what you got. The spicy tuna roll was like no other spicy tuna I've ever had. It was actually REALLY spicy, and tasted like it was made in-house and not store-bought like many other places' spicy tuna. The decor is modern, and we learned that the painting on the walls is done by a local Phoenix artist, which I thought was really cool, because the murals are amazing and I love seeing local talent proudly showcased. It is conveniently located in the lower level of Cityscape and is unfortunately still a little obscured by some scaffolding all around it, so don't miss it! I am happy to have another late-night food option in downtown Phoenix, and since they have happy hour and TVs for sports, I can see me and my husband making quite a few return trips here."}
{"text":"We went here after a concert last night and ordered two sakes,  a salad and a lot of their top teir sushi.  Unfortunately,  we our waiter a total of 3 times. The restaurant was far from busy abs he had plenty of time to chat with his buddies but no time to ask how the meal even was. I have never thought about walking out of a place before bit he wouldn't even come to us with the check!   We sat there for two hours worth empty waters."}
{"text":"I'd give it a 5, except the last two times my wine glasses have been filmy - to the point the server should have felt it on the outside. Both times it took 3 tries to get a clean one. Not sure what changed, but please change it back. I really like this place.   That said, the place has a cool vibe, good sized outdoor patio, pricing is very reasonable and the food has been great. The potstickers are done perfectly - crispy outside, delicious inside and they sit in a ginger-soy sauce. The buffalo chicken house rolls are amazing too. Can't speak for the sushi because we don't eat that, but friends love it. Actually came here because of friends. Always thought it was just sushi but pleasantly surprised by the menu.   Only complaint is the metal outdoor seating inside. Hella uncomfortable. They used to have clear plastic mod chairs that were actually comfortable. Maybe they broke at a certain weight. I'm sure there's a better solution than the metal chairs."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour.   Drinks were decent.   Sushi good.   Reasonable prices.  Beef short rib skewers were delicious.    Pot stickers very good.      Did not like the Kobe burger.   Greasy and without flavor.   Service was OK but bland atmosphere.   Waiters and waitresses did not seem happy.    Need to smile.  Need to be lively and be enthused about the food and working there."}
{"text":"Love the place!  Great food and an even greater atmosphere.  From the moment we walk in, the staff are amazingly friendly and welcoming.  This is how a restaurant should be."}
{"text":"5 star so far after a salmon sashimi, but before the bill. This place is very popular and lively. They play good music and the wait staff will get to you quickly even during peak hours. I'm impressed!"}
{"text":"Took fifteen minutes went by with no greeting. Unbelievable considering there were only three other tables that were seated in the place. Waited an additional 10 and decided to walk out. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Nice environment to eat. I would love to come back and try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Originally we were on the waitlist for Bitter & Twisted so we stopped at Squid Ink for a quick drink but the hospitality here roped us in. Greg and his bar staff made it a point to make us feel more than welcome and had great personalities to top it off. This is more of a thank you than a review :)"}
{"text":"My little sister is visiting me for the weekend to tour ASU's downtown campus (she is 17 and a senior in high school). We decided to go to Squid Ink with some of my friends tonight to celebrate her being in town. My friends were excited because in the past, they have received a free order of edamame at Squid Ink for showing their student IDs. One of my friends, K, asked our server if there was still a deal for the edamame. He said he would ask the manager. When he came back, she asked again, \"Just to confirm, the edamame is free, right?\" He said yes. (My friend K is quite literally the sweetest person I know, so this was all said in a really nice tone.)  When the waiter brought our bill, we realized we had been charged for the edamame. K was mildly upset because she hadn't been planning on ordering anything--she only bought sushi because she thought the edamame was free.  K asked us if we thought she should say something, and we agreed that yes, we probably should, just so they knew about the mixed messages with the student discount. K told the server: \"Hey, I thought the edamame is free or I wouldn't have gotten it, just wanted to know what the deal was.\" The server went and brought his manager back. His manager was instantly confrontational. He said, \"Are you calling my server a liar? Because he told me he did not tell you that it was free.\" The manager, Greg, then went to grab the server. I went to the bathroom because I did not want to be there during the confrontation.  When I came back, K was crying. It was really awful because, like I said, she is the sweetest person I know, and always goes out of her way to be polite. Apparently, the manager had told them, \"I will take care of your meal, but you need to get out now.\" My sister and I paid for our meal and left a tip to be polite. On our way out, K told the hostess politely, \"Could you please let Greg know that we will not be coming back?\"  The hostess replied snarkily, \"From what I heard, that's what he wanted.\"  K began crying again after we left. It was just a really sad experience for us because we were trying to celebrate my sister being home, and instead the manager was instantly confrontational when we were asking about a DISCREPANCY with the student discount policy for a $5 item--we were not even asking for our money back, and we asked very politely. My friends have been going there regularly for years and love the food but none of us will be going back.  What is most shocking to me is that I have worked in fast food service and at a grocery store, and the most important tenet of customer service is that the customer is always right. When a customer cursed at us, yelled at us, etc. we were told to give the customer free food. Here we are at a very nice sushi restaurant, four girls in our teens and early 20s, and when we ask about a discrepancy with a discount, we are kicked out."}
{"text":"Have been here about 10 or so times and food is good.  Would give 4 stars but service tends to be very inconsistent which is a an important part of the experience.  Would say overall just seems the service staff could be a little more friendly and welcoming.  And sometimes a little more knowledgeable about the wine and beer as well as the food menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I love the wings here. DEFINITELY try them. The sushi is amazing too, but you don't think to get wings at a sushi bar."}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment!!! I have been waiting for this place to open for months, I usually eat at Tokyo Lobby but was looking forward to having a great sushi place closer to the house. The place was busy especially for a Monday night but that is no excuse for them to take over 30 minutes for the first 2 rolls of the 3 we ordered to arrive. The rice was like glue, I know it should be sticky but not like this. The fish on the rainbow roll was ok, lacked real flavor. The rolls were half the diameter of Tokyo's and almost twice the price $11 Vegas roll, $13 Rainbow roll and I believe the Surf and Turf was $17. The 3rd roll we ordered did not arrive for another 15 minutes, it was the Surf and Turf roll, this one had great flavor but again the rice sucked. I made the mistake of ordering one more roll (i know stupid) but the 2 of us were still hungry after the first 3 small rolls. The Vegas roll arrived, (how could you screw up something as simple as that?) but they managed, I think I could have done better at a grocery store with that one. The final and most disturbing thing was the flies!!! Some genius designed a sushi bar to have 2 huge garage doors that open so they can have an open air bar. So lets see raw fish+open walls+no fly fans = a very disgusting fly filled dinning experience. The food gets 2 stars but overall a 1 star because of what I am sure can't be a healthy mix of raw fish and flies everywhere.  What a shame!!!"}
{"text":"Service alone here deserves 5 stars!  We happened to wander in here because the original restaurant we wanted to try closed on Sundays.   I don't know what's going on but it was so hot in there, we commented it to our hostess and she goes I'll seat you by the open door so yo can get a better breeze?   Apparently Sunday is happy hour all day, thank goodness because this place isn't cheap.   Pros: - our waiter is the best!  - food came out pretty fast  - spicy tuna was seasoned well, not too spicy   Cons: - roasted garlic edamame was overly salted and no garlic flavor except a few pieces of roasted garlic thrown in  - the menus had no description of the rolls whatsoever  - the restaurant was extremely hot - the cooked rolls as in vegas and soft shell crabs tasted like the rice was mushy and overwhelming"}
{"text":"Squid Ink is a trendier, slightly more upscale sushi bar located in downtown Phoenix.  It is decorated in frosty cool blue tones and features a large bar to the right as you walk in the door.  You will pay more for the sushi here and get less for your money than you would at some other places, however, the quality and taste of the sushi is good.  I would say if you are looking for quality and value, go elsewhere.  However, if you are more in the mood for a night out downtown, don't mind paying a little more, and and are craving sushi, this place is a good bet.  I had the octopus sashimi, california roll, and miso soup.  All were good."}
{"text":"I had been to this place a few times before!    Usually the service is good, but this time I experienced an awful time with Chelsea our waiter.    The Teriyaki Chicken here is great, but anything else is mediocre!  On my last visit to this place, I ordered the Fried Thai Rice, and that was the most disgusting pile of rice I have seen! The rice, was lumpy and flavorless, after not bearing to force myself to eat this gunk, I flagged our waitress down, Chelsea, and told her that as much as I tried liking that plate it was horrible and not Fried Thai rice!!! That it was steamed not fried, she argued back claiming that it's made that way, and then walked away shaking her head!! Talk about rude! Then the Chef came out to apologies, which was truly nice. He claimed that a trainee prepared my dish, and that it was made incorrectly, then brought over a plate he claimed to have prepared himself, it was just as flavorless, but without the funky balls of steamed rice and without water chestnuts, (they probably thought I didn't notice!).    Very neglecting and rude experience! I will never ever, come back to this place! Non-deserving of bringing in a lunch crowd, as I did before!!!"}
{"text":"Yum food was amazing and extremely fresh. Only downside is they have the patio doors open so a few nats and flys get in. Other than that it was a nice place for a quick drink and some sushi."}
{"text":"Thanks for a great happy hour to kick off the holiday week! We needed it and they definitely hooked it up. Love the GF options on happy hour and that it goes until 7. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Showed up for a friends birthday in mid January. There were problems with our reservation, so 16 of us were standing around wondering what will happen next.. Staff was courteous and very helpful after waiting 30-40 mins past our reservation time. Management offered us a good \"we're sorry\".  Our main server was awesome! I wish I could remember his name to give him some props!  Food was excellent! Way better than the Happy Valley location.  Restrooms are hipster and unisex. Could have an attendant or someone attending it more often.  Restaurant is large but skinny. Felt as if they are trying to pack to many patrons in the space allotted.  I would return to this establishment. Overall food=excellent, staff=good/excellent, cleanliness=good. Way better than Happy Valley location in NW Peoria.  Time to check out the new Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Service has gone way down. Most employees put off a pompous hipster attitude. I got a dirty glass from the bar, server didn't come back, so I walked inside to get a different one and that one was also dirty and bar tender didn't care and was more interested in talking with some guys sitting at the bar.  I have been there 3 times since their first year open and their food is consistently mediocre. I think the full bar is keeping this place alive because the area is lacking in such adult activities.  Based on quality of food, poor service, higher that average prices and dirty food and drink vessels I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing service we loved the Flying Phoenix roll. Our waitress was attentive and sweet, we had Kaci and she was top notch. We will be back here soon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour.  The biggest edamame plate I've ever seen.  For $2, it was plenty for two people.  It came with sea salt and garlic.  Very tasty, and I couldn't stop myself from grabbing more.  Very good.  On top of that heaping amount of edamame, my friend and I also split two rolls, two beers...  The total was about $25.  Service was very good.  They kept checking on us, but weren't pushy.  Exactly what I wanted."}
{"text":"Hello Downtown Sushi favorite!!!  Meeting with a friend from out of town that was staying in downtown. I have seen this location but not been here before.  It is located in the Cityscape area. Behind Tilted Kilt. Next to Ice Arena for anyone trying to figure out where it is at.   I was extremely impressed with service and food. Had too many rolls to remember. The sashimi platter had several different cuts of great fish.   Pricing was very comparable to what I have experienced at many other locations.   The bottled beer choices were a little disappointing. I enjoy the Japanese Beers and they had limited.  Would love to see them expand this part of menu.   Got so involved, so quickly, we forgot to take photos.   This will be a regular for downtown.  Looking forward to my next trip downtown to return.  Would also be a great place to sit outside before baseball game and watch light rail go by.."}
{"text":"I have been a sushi fanatic for years and not only was the food amazing, but the customer service was amazing! I was first greeted by a pretty lady at the front who greeted me and said there would be a short wait. Only a few minutes went by before I saw her cleaning off the table quickly to get us seated. It looked like they were hit with a rush and we didn't get taken care of by a waitress...the waitress noticed and quickly came over to address the issue. She came back with waters and said the waitress would be with us quickly. She was very sweet!!! The service was surprisingly quick despite the dinner rush.  I also loved the vibe and music. The unisex bathroom was interesting. Art they had was cool. Overall a cool downtown spot.  I would definitely recommend this to friends and family and I will be back!!"}
{"text":"So glad that Squid Ink opened a location downtown, The food was amazing, I had the Kobe Beef burger and it was delicious and perfectly cooked. Great atmosphere with really cool art. Looking forward to eating there again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here while on vacation from the frozen midwest and exploring downtown Phoenix.   I'm sure it's something to be taken for granted in sunny AZ, but I loved being able to sit at a bar out in the sunshine while it was snowing back home. Yes, I realize that makes me sound like a rube coming to the big city for the first time in his life, but it's true (well... gooooooooollllllly!).  It's a little light on vegetarian options, but the noodle bowl was tasty and large.  The age dashi tofu was unlike any I had before, but that wasn't really a good thing.  HUGE blocks of tofu with a slightly sweet breading and lightly drizzled with a topping. I liked it a lot on the first bite, but after the first one it was so heavy I couldn't eat much.  Prices were decent and the beer was cold.  I can't say I would make a special trip if I was back in town, but the food was decent, the service was friendly, and ambiance was pleasant.  Actually, I really liked the bathroom.  That's a big plus."}
{"text":"Stopped by and sat at the bar with a co-worker. The bartenders were great - we didn't order alcohol but they kept our waters filled the whole time, including when we stayed to talk for a while after we ate. The sashimi platter was decent sized and the fish was all fresh and tasty. Colleague had green tea ice cream and liked it too. The rolls looked really good and unique but we didn't try any."}
{"text":"This was recommended by my friend fame and cuz he's a health but now he doesn't come no more. Ill keep it alive for him."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and managers with decent food.  I have been to the Squid Ink on two separate occasions. Each time I went I have had a pleasurable time chatting with the employees and waitstaff and other patrons. I enjoy the wide variety of cocktails they serve and the beer they have on tap. This is a great place to go and grab a drink and a bite to eat. I am only rating this location 3-stars because I have not tried any dish that I really loved. They do offer a wide variety of foods on their menu. I had some very basic sushi here that just didn't taste very fresh. This really put me off since this is a sushi house. I have also tried the kobe burger which I enjoyed. I hate to say it but maybe sushi is not the way to go when you are dining out at this location."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Squid Ink. They have a friendly staff and a lot of shapes.   Great for large groups! great bright patio vibes with a sports bar.  I got the Tuna Galore (some roll called something like that), Mackerel Nigiri, and the sushi lunch special that came with Spicy Crab roll, and Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail and Shrimp Nigiri. The fish was good! standard fish but they give you really thick generous cuts. The Tuna Galore was awesome and they use cucumber to wrap it so no other flavors overpower the tuna.   This place is a westernized modern restaurant that serves good sushi. It's not your traditional chef sushi bar restaurant so if you are looking for that go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Tried it after they had been open for a week...and it was delicious!  I can only imagine they will get better and better :)"}
{"text":"Most incredible staff we've encountered and, by far, the best happy hour in Phoenix. Oh, and all of the food is amazing. Order the potstickers fried with sweet chile sauce, courtesy of our waitstaff friend, Daniel. Also, $4 Sculpins on happy hour...really!"}
{"text":"Excellent drinks and food.  Service was prompt, without being overbearing.  Outside seating was fun.  Not sure why we hadn't been there before -- maybe the name sounded like a chain restaurant -- but we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten at their other Squid Ink restaurant in the valley, so I assumed this place would be just as good. Yea, no. Sushi was a step above supermarket sushi. Save your money."}
{"text":"So excited for this sushi place and they did not disappoint. The hostess greeted us immediately and was friendly and even had suggestions.  The waiter Eric was very friendly and seemed to be training and both were friendly and quick we had the Tahoe which was my favorite. Oh so yummy!! We had the traditional caterpillar and dragon roll they were both very good we also had the Cougar which was yummy and lastly the extreme philly    Service was quick and accurate.   One of the employees was on their 2nd day and you never would of known it   Think hubby and I found a new sushi joint and look forward to seeing Eric and the gang again"}
{"text":"I would have given more stars but service was yuck and the food did not make up for it. Went in for happy hour with our boys on Saturday night, not busy inside at all- a bit busy on patio but more than enough staff to cover it all. The waitress was either right out of high school or still in high school.. She was about as bright as a dim light bulb when the power is about to go out. She took our order and took a joke my husband made as serious and we has to correct her before she walked away. Then she brought my beer in a bottle and didn't even bother to ask if I wanted a glass with it... Really? And then (just to spare you the other silly details of her inexperience) my husbands sprite was empty and he also has a water-- she started to re-fill the sprite glass with water, even though they put cucumber and lemon in ALL their water glasses... Ummmmm.  Ok-- I was about done.. Then we asked for the check and it took like 10 minutes to get it-- again-- still not busy. Food was good, nothing special to write home about-- good sushi, good HH prices.. Good appetizers.. Just with they would hire some more competent staff."}
{"text":"Don't bother.  Dropped food. Dropped money. Forgetting menu items. Serving one person their ENTIRE meal before anyone else even gets a napkin.   I have a lot to say so I'll have to edit this later to capture the sad decline in service over the past few months that culminated in today's giant fail of a dinner attempt."}
{"text":"This is a great and exciting place to eat outside.  The food and people are exceptional.  This is a well- managed restaurant.  It is at the center of the development in down town Phoenix.  I was surrounded by historical buildings and beautiful people coming and going.  I personally guarantee you will love it."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! I would recommend this for people who are out enjoying downtown, or anyone in the valley looking for great sushi!  Since its centrally located in a great spot, and has a large variety of sushi available to everyone, I would recommend to locals and out of towner's.  The staff from the greeter, to the waitress whom helped us were very nice and professional. Next time you are downtown for a ball game, or an event taking place, or maybe even a stroll be sure you stop by Squid Ink."}
{"text":"The tuna is fresh but the service could have been alot better i think ill give them another try seeing that the slow service was on a DBACKS game night."}
{"text":"We had an absolutely fantastic experience at this restaurant! We hosted a large Christmas party here and it couldn't have gone any better. The entire staff was so professional and did an amazing job all around, from the set-up to the delicious food to the phenomenal staff! We will always come back here and refer everyone we know! The food is just to die for and the wait, bar, & kitchen staff and hostesses are all wonderful! The patio is huge and was perfect for our large party. We've been there so many times before and always get Hunter as our waitress. She is just the best!  This place is such a hidden gem and they have fabulous lunch specials. Our favorite dish is the Beef Negimaki appetizer, Beef Short Ribs and the Hory Fook roll. So good! For the really adventurous, the squid is really good too!"}
{"text":"I have been to Squid Ink a few times. The food is great.. The service is great. Went for a solo lunch there and the waitress was really good about not overbearing me or disappearing. I really like the patio. The happy hour has pretty good prices, but outside of happy hour it can be a bit pricey. Great for date night or dinner before a show!"}
{"text":"I love the fact that this place has happy hour all day on Sunday's. The price is reasonable and the staff are very friendly and outgoing. They are also on top of refilling water and checking up on you. I love their sushi and their spicy mayo!"}
{"text":"Really, really good food. Grilled salmon was the bomb! If you don't want to wait, call in your order for pick-up!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been exploring Phoenix for the past month for good food. We're really glad we found this place since it's close to our house and has an amazing happy hour. We sat at the bar where the chef served us some high quality sushi (I mean, it was $3!) and was very friendly.  My only complaint was that the servers weren't very attentive, there were two and they just a followed each other around. They also spend a lot of time on the restaurant side of the bar and paid nearly no attention to the side with the sushi bar (it was full on both sides). We were finally asked if we needed our checks about 20 minutes after we had finished eating. I get that it was busy, but seriously, they could've just parted ways to cover more ground."}
{"text":"New Year's Eve brought us around the corner to warm up with some delicious hot sake.  It was so cold in Phoenix and while waiting for a cab, my hubby requested his favorite drink, sake.  Squid was the only place open (that we knew of) around, so we settled in for a quick drink.  The waitress informed us that they were closing and really couldn't give us any food.  If she went to ask the chef, maybe they could get something together for us.  We passed on the food but asked for some hot sake.  The sake was pretty reasonable for about $8 for a large.  Everything went good and she told us to come back while we were still in town and try out the food.  She wouldn't be there the following day but to come back anyway.  Mistake!  The next day, we were trolling along the streets of downtown Phoenix again and decided to try a roll and some more sake.  The waiter was really nice and we ordered a rainbow roll.  My husband and I always order rainbow rolls because you can really taste the assorted fish on top for freshness and then still get a feel of how the chefs are with the rolling techniques.  Our itty bitty roll comes to the table and my husband instantly points out that the middle has a crab stick and not the shredded crab that consists of mayo, etc.  He is already disappointed. I venture on with my sampling.  Yeah uh no taste or flavor at all.  It was like eating weighed down air.  I literally could have eaten a dried ball of paper.  The fish had no flavor at all.  None!  The rice, tasted like they deliberately sucked the entire flavor out of it.  You couldn't even distinguish the avocado.  We left disappointed and wondering how the hell that waitress thought the food was good.  Maybe we should have come back when she was working and she could have told us the favorites.  Oh by the way, we were brought out some miso soup that was ok but definitely not the trip back.  We can by sake at the grocery store for cheaper."}
{"text":"My friend and I came for dinner and we like the food but have had issues with service being slow or attentive. Came back for about the 4th time solely for the buffalo chicken roll. Got seated and sat for 20 minutes- no one said hello, offered us water or took our order. Tables right next to us being served, greeted and walked past us repeatedly. Multiple folks. Got up and left- not even a glass of water was provided. Do not go here and I'll never be back. AWFUL."}
{"text":"Here for sushi lunch.  Sat on the bar side patio.  Prices were great. Service was great. Lunch special with the house rolls are a great deal, maybe better than the happy hour selection.  Food was prepared quickly and the sake was hot. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not sure why so many negative comments on their experience with the staff and food but my wife and I had a great time. For the type of location, atmosphere, food quality and I thought prices were reasonable, the staff was professional and personable. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner! Thai beef salad was amazing! Bubulubu was awesome! The cougar was so good we had two rolls. The Thai fried rice was amazing so much so that my picky 2 year old eat all her dinner. Miso soup was the best we ever had. Edamame was great. Definitely coming back! Libby was great she came to check on us. Natalia was a great waitress. All the staff was amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent service by Alex and team, fresh cold beer, hot filling miso soup and fresh thick sashimi and well made sushi. I highly recommend this location it's large, bright, music isn't too loud and it's clean. lunch special goes till 2 p. M. And happy hour doesn't start till 3 p. M. So there's one hour lag time when you don't get any specials. Keep that in mind if you're stopping by on an afternoon. Seriously the crispest Kirin light I've ever had at any place I've ever been to, very cold and good. a nice big cold glass of ice water delivered with fresh lemon and a slice of cucumber. Nice touch squid ink. We'll be back to this location."}
{"text":"Love the set up, great food, good service and open until midnight! Just know they don't serve sushi after 10 pm. They have a wonderful salmon dish that's just to die for!! (tried it because I didn't know they stopped serving sushi at 10pm) Glad I did because I went back a 2nd time just for that dish! OMG it was delish on steroids! A bit pricy compared to some other places  but it is downtown so that's to be expected. It is worth trying though because its one of the better sushi bars I've been to."}
{"text":"Okay, i sooo Badly wanted to Love this place, or at least find it \"average\", especially since my previous 2 reviews of other restaurants were so negative...so i walk up to this place excited, i've heard good things from people i actually know, not just yelpers... and the place is packed, and i mean, inside and out... Packed. So it must be fantastic, right????....  But FML, Cr@p.... Now 3 consecutive negative reviews under my belt (i figure some of you people are gonna start Q'ing my opinions, haha)... With that in mind, i considered holding off on this review until i ate somewhere i loved, that way there wouldn't be 3 consecutive bad reviews.  However,  if i don't review it now, while the after taste of my \"figurative\" regurgitation still lingers, then I'm afraid i might go too easy on them, and bump it up to an undeserving 2 stars at a later date...  Look, I'm not raciest, however, anytime you see that NONE of the \"Sushi Chefs\" are Japanese, but instead they're all Mexican or Caucasian ... Run.    ~Just my unsolicited 2 cents."}
{"text":"I went middle of the day on 7Dec17 and everything was great servers sushi, appetizers and drink. But who ever made the ramen let just say it was horrible. Plan no taste and no flavor and only thing good on was the crab meat in was horrible"}
{"text":"This place was ok but not great. There were a number of the rolls on the menu that do not have an explanation of their ingredients which resulted in the bartender pulling out a cheat sheet to fill me in. Asked about a few different ones but then just went for a glass of wine and the cougar roll which was one of the house rolls and detailed in the menu.  The roll was delivered, never received a napkin or chopsticks and despite there only being 8 people in the place could never get anyones attention to get anything, napkin, wine or even another roll. Paid my $34 bill, left hungry and dissapointed."}
{"text":"Service is awful but food is pretty good. The cod appetizer is amazing, it melts in your mouth, nice combination of flavors, really delish! The tuna on tuna cucumber roll was also really good, I'd definitely have both of these again. The miso soup is pretty standard. My friends were not as impressed with their rainbow roll or regular tuna roll. Food is pricey. We went at lunch time with only a couple of other tables filled, it took a really long time to be served. It's a large restaurant with a nice outdoor seating area but be aware that traffic is heavy so it gets uncomfortably loud."}
{"text":"So, I really liked this place even though the Scottsdale location got better reviews.  The rolls were tasty, the drinks were good and the decor and atmosphere were nice.  The decor is modern and clean.  Good music hums in the background...Kindof techno-y, but it fits the atmosphere and isn't annoying.  The Husband and I went on a Monday afternoon around 5pm and there was hardly anyone there.  We sat on the outside portion of the bar which has two TVs and it was nice and breezy outside. My only complaint was the city bus stop right in front of the restaurant, it was pretty noisy, but that's downtown livin for ya! :) The rolls were tasty.  We had the shrimp tempura, spicy crab, the vegas roll and a california roll.  I loved the shrimp tempura roll and the spicy crab was my next favorite.  The Husband thought they were all pretty good.  I'm definitely not a sushi connoisseur, (I've only been eating it for about 4 years), but I've had better quality sushi.  This however was still tasty and I enjoyed my experience.  Will definitely go back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Well, that was an hour I'll never get back. Narrow aisles and seating so close you think that the people next to you are part of your group. The clear plastic seating is an eyesore and not properly cleaned, so it shows all the little smudges, spots, etc (and they are not very comfy). Our waitress was either new to waitressing, or too shy for the job. Come on, if my menu is in the way when you are trying to put my glass of water on the table, say excuse me. Don't push my menu into my chest with my water to make room. She also barely checked up on us. For a Monday afternoon and hardly anyone in the place, I expected a little better service.  The food was alright and edible. The rolls are anything but sushi. Almost everything has ingredients that requires cooking, which isn't sushi. What didn't require cooking, such as the rolls topped with salmon, came in at room temperature and wasn't very appetizing. My friend loved her dynamite roll though, and I admit, I liked it too. I ordered a roll that had tempura shrimp and the tempura coating was rubbery and stretchy, meaning it wasn't freshly cooked. So gross.  There's better sushi out there with much better atmospheres. Period."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service. Waited 20 min to be acknowledged. This was after moving into the restaurant from the bar where we sat for 15 min. Was finally greeted at the sushi bar only to have our server give us used sushi menu and then dissapeared for another 5 min.   The place was not busy. At all. We kindly left. Went to Hannys."}
{"text":"Sat for 20 minutes and never saw a server, ended up leaving. Terrible management if there is any at all."}
{"text":"If you are looking to have fresh sushi this place is it. Sushi made to order and when it arrives it is done perfectly. We ordered several appetizers and an entree each. As our dishes were brought to the table we realized that some of the entrees were brought out before all the appetizers. When we question the server he said thats they bring out food as it is prepared and not in an order if appetizers first and entrees later. As it turns out it worked out because we just shared all the dishes. Each appetizer and entree sushi rolls were fresh and delicious. Once done we ordered desert, pineapple upside down treat. OMG soooo good.  You need to see my posted picture of the upside down pineapple. A picture says a thousand words."}
{"text":"Average for Happy Hour. We got 2 rolls, spicy tuna and a toostie. They were fine that's about it. I also ordered the beef yakisoba. WOW, it was TERRIBLE. I should have sent it back. It was way too salty and the beef tasted like it had been frozen and microwaved. GROSS. I could have done better if I cooked the noodles from a packet of ramen and topped it with jar teriyaki sauce. I paid $15 for this, what a waste."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time and loved it. Spicy crab roll & shrimp tempura were delicious. Tried the ramen and it wasn't very good. Very bland and too much going on. We also had the miso cod appetizer, very delicious."}
{"text":"This place was delicious we had 4 rolls and garlic edamame and cocktails fresh sushi  and awesome presentation topped it all of with a bottle saki oh yeah! Must try"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite sushi place to go to. It's an eat in/eat out bar area. Perfect for any girls night, date night or casual day to dine. There's a huge table inside to accommodate large parties, plenty of sitting in the bar area as well.    They have fresh seafood all the time, and the ramen is amazing! The Surf n Turf roll is absolutely delicious as well. I've also had their mango cosmo  so good!"}
{"text":"Fresh fresh food, unique menu items, great atmosphere. There is a large bar with three tv's, a sushi bar, nice patio with heaters and live music. We were lucky because it's only been open a week so it's not crowded yet. It has a few things to work out but nothing big. It's great. Hurry in! Or don't, so we won't have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Excellent service!! Victor was phenominal and i could not be happier with my first visit. The happy hour all day sunday was perfect for my friends and I! We will definitley be back!"}
{"text":"A little overpriced but delicious!! The happy hour is quite good with food and drinks and extends until 7pm. The ramen is amazing and the highlight of the meal was the Surf & Turf roll was out of this world!!! Joey is an awesome server and added so much to our experience!! He has the best personality and is such a joy to be around! Also, a really great position in the center of downtown, close to everything. We walked over from our hotel a couple nights a week. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of different sushi restaurants, from tucson, California, Texas, and Korea. I give this place a 4 star because the quality was great. Service can improve a bit, took about 10 min for anyone to notice my friend and I at the bar. I absolutely loved the spicy salmon roll and salmon nigiri. The all day happy hour is what got our attention :) Pretty affordable price for the great location it's in."}
{"text":"Venue, appetizers, service and sushi.    Not in love with the plastic chairs, but I will take the blame for that as I am plus size.  The atmosphere is really nice for a mall.  Its very open and bar opens to the restaurant and the patio giving the restaurant a great flow.  With the TVs in the bar you can sit close enough to see the score without killing the table's conversation.   The wings were a shocker.  I am a wing connoisseur and Squid Ink has great wings.  We also did the pot stickers which were pretty standard.  They must have been fried as they had a crispy shell, probably the only way to get the served so fast.     Our server had a very professional demeanor and inked Emo appearance.  The service was good, if a little formal.    The sushi was A-OK.  The service and the appetizers pulled in the extra star.  I usually eat rols and the rice was good and the amount of fish in the rol was A-OK.  The use of the seeds seemed a little heavy handed, so when I go back I will ask them to skip the seeds."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, good sushi  I really liked the ambiance and the fact that it was right in cityscape. An easy walk to other venues and places like the comerica theater. Our server was polite and the crab wontons were my favorite. My second choice in sushi behind Sushi brokers in Scottsdale. Try to get there before the happy hour ends at 7pm. It's also nice they are open so late on weekdays."}
{"text":"Let me say first that I am not into sushi at all....  It was my friend's birthday and she requested sushi for dinner. I looked up this place and it looked pretty good and since we wanted to stay locally in downtown it was perfect location.   We got there and place was so busy. The hostess was extremely helpful and made sure to get us a really nice table in timely manner.   Between 6 of us, we ordered so much food. So, I decided to give a sushi yet another try.  And I must say it was a success. I tried a lots of different kinds and it was all pretty good despite my lack of love for sushi.   Server was awesome as well. She was very present and helped us with all questions that we had. She made sure to check on us at all times and was really kind and funny at the same time!   Atmosphere was really good. We had a great time and I am for sure going back to the Squid Inc again. Maybe not for sushi but for drinks and ambiance for sure."}
{"text":"Giving this 2 stars due to my affinity for Scottsdale location which is now closed. Came down here to pre game before Bon Jovi and clearly squid Ink didn't need my business. Upon walking in host told me there were no tables... went to bar for 10 minutes and couldn't get the attention of any of the 3 bar tenders on duty despite not being that busy. I noticed multiple 4 top tables open and went back to host who told me he wouldn't  seat me there. After waiting 5 more minutes for drink we left. We will not be back as we did not feel welcome."}
{"text":"The decor beautiful- the atmosphere bubbly and the sushi was AMAZING!!!! WE ordered our meal as take out and took back to our resort after a long day fishing. The wasabi was one of the best we've ever had and there was one roll we had that was super wonderful (forgot name) has a thin layer of cucumber. Can't wait to return back to Peoria as Squid Ink will be the first restaurant we visit!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in phoenix. Will def be back. The hagadashi tofu was the best I ever had and every roll we had was amazing. I can wait to try the scottsdale restaurant to see if they are as good."}
{"text":"Just wow! In the past we've tried Groupons for sushi but we've always left disappointed. Look people, just stop it! It's like these guys are NBA all stars and all those other restaurants are playing at a high school level.  This was our first time at this location but my fiancee and I had been to the other locations a couple times. I'll just leave a quick review. To start with, they have happy hour 7 days a week and it goes until 7 pm. Places of this quality just don't do that! We had a few of the starters and a couple different rolls and they were all excellent. We sat at the indoor/outdoor bar facing inwards and really loved the atmosphere.  Aesthetically, the place is five stars. There's a great balance between modern and organic, especially the hand-crafted hardwood tables. Last but not least, the service was excellent. Crystal and Eric took great care of us, they're friendly and bring some personality to their service. Just love this place!"}
{"text":"I had the Hory Fook roll and my husband had the Sashimi Lunch Platter.  We also split edamame which was perfectly salted. The roll was delicious however a little pricey. My husband said the sashimi was good, but the salmon was still a little frozen. We'd go back again. The inside has a nice modern vibe. We enjoyed the patio since it was a nicely breezy spring day."}
{"text":"I have been here before and decided to order take out. We ordered about 4 rolls, soup, and curry. The lady that took our order read it back to us and said it will be ready in 30 minutes, which seemed like a long time. We waited and got there and was told to pay at the bar. We stood at the bar for about 20 minutes and we know the bar tender saw us. She took other orders, gave tickets, made drinks before even asking us. She then could not find our order and then continued to place orders, make drinks. Then a manger walked by and she came to us and asked what we had ordered and when. She stated well I can remake it. I went over how long we have been waiting and she said ok I can give up 50% off. I was outraged that she expected us to wait another 30 minutes for 50% off. You guys need to step up. If you are that busy get more help."}
{"text":"We were in downtown Phoenix late Sunday night looking for dinner. Nothing was open but Squid Ink so we reluctantly went in. We made the right choice. The staff were friendly and conversational because we were talkative. They left a couple alone who wanted privacy. They have two kitchens...sushi and a regular kitchen. We ordered a salmon roll and a crab roll and split the ramen (pork belly and imitation crab). The sushi was delicious. The boiled egg in the ramen was perfect. Upon the recommendation of the waiter, we had the Dirty Rockstar roll. It was heaven in my mouth. The beer was local and nicely complimented the food."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with some friends last night. Very modern sushi bar with some mood lighting that was a bit too dark. We all used our phones for reading of the menus. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and 3 rolls. The sushi was amazing, fresh and clean tasting. The ramen was good, liked the slices of pork belly, crab meat and the soft boiled egg topped it off. The ramen soup however tasted off. If anything i'd recommend they work on improving the taste of the soup. Besides the lighting and soup, all was awesome!"}
{"text":"We went about a month ago for the first time and LOVED it.   Our waitress was exceptional. Very friendly, attentive, and had lots of great food recomendations.  Great atmosphere.  A bit loud, but quieter than most Ra Sushis I've been too.  Sushi was some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner n drinks. The specialty selection is limited, pretty unique and different. Staple rolls are all there. The service started out pretty poor but it improved as the night went on. Has indoor and outdoor seating. The place can handle a good amount of people as long as the bar tenders are on top of their game.  The specialty rolls here are less traditional smooth taste and have slightly louder flavorful flair to them. The atmosphere esp sitting on the outside half of the bar was nice, I would go back."}
{"text":"I may be a little biased because this is directly under my apartment and it is so super convenient to swing by and grab sushi from here.. But I really like this place. It's quick, the service is great and it has a trendy vibe with an outdoor bar. Squid Ink has become my neighborhood sushi spot. I usually sit outside when I dine in, otherwise I'm ordering take out, which by the way is usually ready in ten minutes or so! The front desk staff, Aida, is so sweet and remembers me as soon as I tell her my name over the phone! A few favorites include the dynamite roll, which has a special twist with a whole cooked piece of salmon on top; unlike your usual crab topping that is typically garnished on the roll.   Once a week or so I have an extreme craving for their miso soup, which I pick up and take upstairs to enjoy with a movie! Another favorite would be the Pot Stickers- served with scallions and a \"tiger\" dipping sauce which is a ginger-soy tangy and savory treat.  One thing I would definitely stay away from (and the main reason there are not five stars*) is the Toro. I was a little disappointed with the Toro- (usually known for the fatty, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth consistency) ironically, the first piece of Toro I consumed was extremely chewy... I had to swallow the whole piece after trying to chew that one single piece for a prolonged period of time..  A few things to consider:  -There is a parking garage that is connected to the building (Cityscape), but I always walk so I'm not sure if it's validated. Fairly priced parking. -Quick bar service"}
{"text":"I give four stars mainly for service and feel of the restaurant. I thought the food was okay. I have sushi, and unfortunately, I could smell the salmon and the tuna. That is the last thing you want when eating raw fish. I ate it, and am still alive, so no foul there, just a bit of fish stink. My daughter got the teriyaki chicken which she liked, and we shared the tempura green beans and potstickers both were good. Other than the sushi, which I will give another try, the experience was good, and the service was great.  They have a very good happy hour offering as well. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Let me start off with what was good, the service. The server was quick, knowledgeable and very personable. The sushi chef also was personable and knowledgable, however, the knowledge he imparted was not really what I wanted to hear.  I ordered the Toro sashimi and was expecting that wonderful melt in your mouth goodness that is Toro. What I got was the antithesis of melt in your mouth, it was an unpalatable, chewy hunk of fish.  When I returned the remainder of the dish to the chef he informed me that it was because they freeze all their fish. I don't believe I've ever been to a sushi restaurant that uses frozen fish, but I am new to Phoenix so this may be a thing here. It's certainly not for me though.  Although I will not be returning for a second chance, I must say that they were gracious enough to comp my wife's sushi roll and apologized for the food quality."}
{"text":"I have visited squid ink several times and each time is incredible. I generally find my self here for happy hour where all their appetizers are half off and and very affordable drinks. From the moment I walk in I am greeted with smiling faces and a wonderful atmosphere. This is why I give squid ink 5 stars because the service and food are superb and exceed my expectations.   Some of my favorite dishes include: chicken wings, crab rangoons, potstickers, buffalo chicken roll, dirty rockstar roll, flying Phoenix, and the surf n turf roll"}
{"text":"I came here before a show at Stand Up Live. It's a nice laid back place with a great staff. We started with chicken wings and green bean tempura for appetizers. Shortly after our food came. We ordered Spicy Tuna, California and Hory Fook Rolls all of which were on the Happy Hour menu. We ended our meal with the Hawaiian Bread Pudding. It was simply amazing. If you come and don't get the bread pudding you've wasted your trip. I would've given Squid Ink five stars but my only complaint is e seating in the restaurant. Everything is so close together and you can hear your neighbors conversation as they can hear yours.  All in all it was a great experience and I would return!"}
{"text":"Splatoon themed sushi bar!! ...kidding...  Garlic edamame was a big winner.  That had to be the most generous unagi nigiri I've ever had. Wow.  Dirty Rockstar & Pokemon rolls were bomb af. Spicy Lemony Goodness.  Zushi \"Box Roll\" was a total miss. Way too much crab and rice. Fail.  Cocktails - The Genever and Muddy Something were fantastic.  Kind of on the pricy side, but got treated super well so A+ service. I came in last night, they were pretty dead, and I was the only one at the bar so I think the sushi dudes spoiled me quite a bit. pro-tip: going to a vacant sushi bar is the best because everything comes out fast and they tend to be more generous on servings. Servers were extremely friendly and helpful. I think the fact that it was relatively vacant helped in giving me superstar treatment."}
{"text":"Awful! We are big sushi fans and eat sushi at least once a week, and this restaurant is by far the worst sushi place I have ever been to. First of all, it's terribly overpriced. Secondly, none of their sushi chefs are Japanese so they have no idea what they are doing. The spicy tuna hand roll I ordered came out with mushy rice paper, and they try to tell me that is how Rice paper is supposed to be. My husband ordered a fish roll, and the fish was crusty and not fresh. The wasabi had been sitting under a lamp for so long that it was dried and crusty on the edges. Gross, gross, gross. I would not return to eat here if they offered me food for free"}
{"text":"Best happy hour for kids!! Half off  all apps and a few rolls. . My kids want to go every week after school. I can feed three of us for under $20 during happy hour which is great for single parents and the kids love it!!"}
{"text":"This is based on ambiance alone.  Went to have some sushi on a Friday evening with my wife.  Walked in...the place was swarming with people.  Kids, teens, 20-30 somethings, you name it.  Packed to the gills.  Extremely loud, kids running around, and it almost felt like I was in a high school cafeteria.  The tables were plastic and cheap looking.  The wait was about 45 minutes and I didn't think I could last 5.  It was a complete eye sore and ear sore.  We ended up walking out and going elsewhere.  Not sure if I would go back.  This is not the ambiance I anticipate from a sushi restaurant.  This place felt like the Chuck E Cheese of sushi.  Maybe it was a bad night, maybe mom and dad should get a sitter..."}
{"text":"Really great experience for us! Excellent menu with some fun ideas and options. Always nice to try a place with new varieties of rolls and apps. Great staff, excellent location. Can't wait to go back.  Try the Shishito Peppers and the Ultimate Philly Roll.  Awesome."}
{"text":"Sushi is good but the customer service sucks like wow it was bad! Our waiter was just bad I guess because the other lady doing the other tables kept coming back all the time ours was just bad food didn't take long but he only refilled our waters once in our whole 60$ meal. He also didn't bring us napkins till after we ate when I asked for them twice before that time. Sushi is good!"}
{"text":"Well, well, well...finally. A great sushi restaurant in the Lake Pleasant area. I've been patient, I've been pacing, and I've been traveling too far for deliciousness...but now I don't have too!  I attended the friends & family night for this beautiful new sushi bar and I'll just begin with the easiest part -- the atmosphere. It's the first thing people will notice when they walk in and if you're like me, you won't be disappointed. Elegant, yet comfortable. Modern, yet homey. The bars -- both sushi and booze -- look fantastic as does the outside patio which I can't wait to check out when it cools down.  Now, onto the other things. The servers were friendly and attentive. You could tell they were busy (opening night, duh!) but rarely did they or the manager (who came to our table to check on us :) seemed to show it. The food came out promptly and the presentations were super nice. Nothing was outrageously expensive but that didn't in any way compromise the taste of anything. Fresh sashimi & nigiri, awesome apps., and a nice selection of specialty drinks, beer, and wine.  I highly recommend going into Squid Ink because if opening night was this good, just imagine how much better they'll be as time goes on! On any given night, chances are you'll see me there, back for more great food and service."}
{"text":"Strange is the only way to sum up my experience.  Upon walking in, we were greeted by a hostess a few cards short of a full deck.  Bless her heart,  I will give more details on her in a moment.  I go for sushi all the time and one great thing about the sushi experience is how guests are ALWAYS greeted by the sushi chefs.  That won't happen here. All doom and gloom and unfriendly....One of the chefs, I can only describe as \"sour face\".  He comes up later in my review. We were shown to our table where I got to sit on a VERY cracked lucite chair.....thank god I am small, but I still worried about it giving way beneath me.  The menu had an average selection of the \"same ol, same ol\" sushi rolls.  We decided on the assorted sushi platter.  Nothing exciting.  I did have to send back 2 dirty plates that still had rice baked on them.  After we placed our order, I made a quick trip to the ladies room to wash my hands.  As I passed the hostess, l noticed her fully engaged in writing on some paper, as got closer, I saw that she was really drawing stick people with a thick blue marker.   Like something a 5 year old would do.  OK!  Didn't know quite how to process that. But moving on.  After I returned to the table, we heard another party yelping at the table behind us.  Talking about a cougar roll.  So we added it to our order. Our disappointing assorted sushi  platter came.  For $22.00 I expected better.  The quality was eh...  Rubber octopus.....squishey room temperature eel, fake crab. Then the cougar roll came, $14.00 for imitation crab in a cucumber slathered with sweet chili sauce.  I dont get it?  But others liked it.  I had also asked for fresh wasabi, I was brought the portion size of one teaspoon. No kidding.  I am not doubting it was fresh, but it was mixed with something else because it was really liquidy?  It was ok.  However, it was not worth the extra $2.00 charge.  The waitresses was stunned we were charged for it, and although we didn't dispute the charge, she thought it was unfair enough to take it up with old \"sour face\".  He was totally rude to her and was irritated she challenged the extra charge. Our waitresses was the only good thing about the whole place.  Over priced, average food.  A total, DNR, Do Not Return.  I am surprised this place has such high ratings?  I would not revisit, there are far better places for sushi."}
{"text":"Came in late Sunday night. Good ambiance, great food, good drink selection. Would return if I came back to Phoenix. Had the coconut curry chicken and sushi. It was delicious."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place as they have some great looking non-sushi dishes. Try as I might, I just don't like sushi. But my friends love it, so I thought this would be a great place to meet up.  Everybody else liked the sushi; I wasn't so fortunate with my dish. The beef short rib was dry and the flavor just seemed off.  I'd be willing to give them another go though when it's sushi night again."}
{"text":"Pretty good and very reasonable during happy hour.  I had calamari, pot stickers, and shrimp roll for $12 plus tip. THat is pretty good price.  The calamari is among the best in the west valley.  The shrimp roll was good.  The pot stickers were a little over cooked. Service was decent."}
{"text":"I always order their fries here, because they're the best fries I've ever had in my entire life. I usually do half regular and half sweet potato. The service is slow usually, even during times with less business."}
{"text":"I had this ridiculous hankering for salmon sashimi last week, and I was extremely lucky to find that there was a sushi place a block from my hotel. Also, I wanted to enjoy an outdoor lunch - it was 65 and sunny in Phoenix. I needed to enjoy it before I went back to freezing Cincinnati temperatures.  This is where squid ink comes in. Their patio is beautiful and a great place for people watching while you enjoy your meal. I ordered a beer and salmon sashimi, plus a roll. The bartender was kind enough to give me miso soup to start as it was technically lunch, although I didn't order the lunch special.  Let me tell you, the sushi quality is FANTASTIC. The sashimi was buttery and smooth, just like good salmon sashimi should be. My problem with this particular restaurant is that their flavor combination rolls are absurd. The restaurant has extremely fresh fish to work with, but all of the options for rolls were over-the-top and unappetizing. I ended with the Pokémon roll, which included pickled jalapeño and pineapple. Why? Why would you ruin the beautiful fresh flavor that comes with the quality fish you have? That is only reason I wouldn't come back. If I am in Phoenix and want sushi again, I will only be getting nigiri and sashimi here."}
{"text":"This place is best summed up in a list of pros and cons:  PRO: The best and most creative selection of specialty rolls I've seen in a while; nice ambiance; beautiful presentation, real crab.  CONS: It is a little pricey (to a certain extent this is warranted given ambiance, real crab, and menu selection).  Specific to my visit: I gotta say I was intrigued by the idea of  the Buffalo Chicken Roll but it was a disappointment.  Not very much flavor at all, and considering you're getting chicken for the price of sushi-grade seafood... not a great value either.  My other roll was fantastic, so it's not indicative of all their food.  I'd just take a pass on that one roll.  And finally, a shout-out to my server. She was quick, attentive, perky, and genuinely pleasant to interact with."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I LOVE Squid Ink... It's our \"go to\" place for sushi.  The atmosphere is beautiful and trendy.  The staff have never disappointed in the dozen or so times we've been.  We love the squid and miso cod appetizers!  My favorite rolls are the Pokemon and the Seafood Dynamite, but we've had the opportunity to try all of them and they're all extremely delicious!!  We have also gone to their Peoria location and am looking forward to trying their restaurant downtown soon!   See you there!!"}
{"text":"First off, I am judging this place only as a bar/social gathering spot.  I have not tried much of the food besides the terryachi style chicken n rice, which was decent  Sometimes, its not the service,staff,atmosphere the kills a place for people..... its the other PATRONS of that place.  I just moved here from Michigan, so maybe its a difference in regions, but damn if there are not some immature middle aged people who frequent here.  I went in there a few Fridays back and had the joy of sitting next to the biggest 40 year old guy who was acting like he was still 21 and in a Frat.  It was funny reading another Yelper's comment about this place being a cougar hangout... sure enough, to my left were a group of 3 middle aged ladies trying to ... well, i dunno exactly, I guess hang on to what is left of their \"youthfulness\"  They were not loud or obnoxious like the Dbag next to me ( who's wife I felt incredibly sorry for).  I took a look around and it seemed the rest of the patrons were of the same caliber.  The few people my age seemed to be somewhat hipster-ish  Beer prices were not that great ) (4.25$ for bottle of Guinness)  Like I said, I was at the bar area and floated around outside for a second.  If you go for the food and sit at the Sushi bar/dining area with a date or friends..... perhaps its a totally different experience.  Bartender girl was fit, gorgeous, and very nice"}
{"text":"Overrated. Place to see for ambiance, not to enjoy quality sushi. Food is blah. Paid almost $100.00 for two people and the food was fair. Not happy with my first time there. Most likely will not return. Not even for drinks. I can get that somewhere else and enjoy great food at the same time."}
{"text":"Ok food and service sucks. The only reason they are still in business is because they are the only sushi downtown. Sunday afternoon only one other table and waitress is just the worst. Stay away n go the extra distance for gas station sushi."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place was only 3.5 stars I normally don't care for sushi but my husband loves it! We sat at the bar and Amy was our server/bartender she is very personable and had great recommendations!! The food was great and the service was OUTSTANDING!! We will come back!! Thanks Amy for a great experience!"}
{"text":"This place has great happy hour and on a SATURDAY! Apps and certain rolls were half off too. Very nice place, can't wait to try it again for dinner."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour. The sushi was alright. I got the spicy tuna and the green bean tempura. The spicy tuna wasn't anything special but the green bean tempura was big and yummy! I would defiantly go for the green bean tempera but probably not more sushi. The service was good, the waiter was very helpful. The interior is contemporary and very comfortable."}
{"text":"I liked the vibe of this place but the food was just so so. The happy hour pricing is pretty good.  We ordered an octopus dish that was a special for comicon and the beef negamaki. I am a big fan of octopus, but this wasn't my favorite octopus. The spice was great but the octopus was a little too chewy for my taste. The beef negamaki was much better with a sauce that had a great kick to it."}
{"text":"What the world needs is not more sushi places but quality sushi places.  Squid Ink is 100% the quality place that should be the norm.  Started off with the usual Miso soup- a nice surprise was the mushrooms added.  Good flavor and added a twist.  Tried the Raman Noodles and while not a big soup fan, what went in the broth was excellent and very tasty.  No question it's a meal and not a soup.  Added the egg for the heck of it.  After the soup came a few rolls- most memorable was the surf and turf was cooked excellent as the meat part was tender.    Sushi was fresh and well prepared.  Overall a good experience and will be back"}
{"text":"It's ok. It wasn't good-- wasn't bad. I did see a lot of flies tho. That kinda grossed me out. But nothing special AT ALL. I was expecting more out of this place because of the location. Blue Hound, Breakfast Club are great restaurants. Also Gold's Gym in that area is so nice. Then there's this sushi place and you think like... wow thats it? I went here when it was super empty and they still took forever with my meal. I would NEVER go back here. I recommend \"How do you roll?\" thats in the same area which is a custom sushi shop."}
{"text":"Today was the third time in a row that my husband & I have had horrible service. There were multiple tables outside that had not been cleaned. We then went inside to find a semi clean table in the bar area. The bartender looked right at us and didn't even acknowledge our presence. Needless to say, we walked right out and took our business somewhere else! We will not be returning any time soon unless something changes!"}
{"text":"We've been to Squid Ink 3 times now and each time the food has been very tasty.  On 2 of the occasions they had live music which wasn't great and WAY too loud for dining.  We've always had good service and the sushi is absolutely delicious.  We'll continue to dine at Squid Ink, but keep our earplugs handy."}
{"text":"I picked up a takeout sushi order here when I was visiting on business.  I'm a huge fan of creative, fusion rolls so I was immediately drawn to the House Rolls.  I will admit I was a little disappointed there wasn't a wider range (a lot of the rolls seem to use a lot of the same ingredients in different configurations), but I was intrigued by the Dirty Rockstar and Ultimate Phily so I ended up ordering both of them along with a seaweed salad.  Pricing seemed fair for these kind of items.  With each dish there were things I liked and things that just seemed off to me.  In the seaweed salad the seaweed itself was tasty but there was just an odd flavor to the daikon radish.  With the Dirty Rockstar I enjoyed the flavor overall but the sweet chili sauce was too cloying and didn't meld well with the other flavors.  With the Ultimate Philly I really enjoyed the taste at first but there was just a very odd flavor at the end of the taste that lingered into a bad after taste I didn't care for.  I actually left a few pieces of sushi behind and I'm usually someone who loves sushi to the point of overeating.  Overall, this was just okay.  It was a step up from ordering room service but I wouldn't go out of my way to order it again if I were regularly in the area."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have ever left a review anywhere but I have to because it was so bad! We got to squid ink about 12:20 and as the waitress brought our waters we put in our order immediately. We ordered 2 bowls of chicken teriyaki and 2 rice bowls with shrimp and curry. We also got edamame to start with. The waitress brought our edamame in about 20 minutes. We waited about another half hour not being checked on without our waters being filled to be told after being there for an hour that our white rice was being substituted for brown rice. We said that was fine and the waitress brought out a complementary fried tofu appetizer. About 15 minutes later the waitress brought two of the dishes which were the shrimp dishes. All that was in the dish was steamed vegetables and four pieces of shrimp. I asked where the rice was and the waitress said they were out of rice. I told the waitress we weren't going to eat a dish with just shrimp and vegetables and she asked us if we wanted to speak with the manager. We waited another five minutes for the manager who never came to the table. We waited for an hour and 15 minutes for a dish with four pieces of shrimp and steamed vegetables after the waitress made us think we were getting some sort of rice. We ended up leaving without speaking to the manager. This was the worst customer service and the worst dining experience I've ever had. Don't go here!"}
{"text":"Great place. They have an awesome happy hour.  The location is downtown and close to any events that may be happening. The service is fast and the staff is always extremely friendly and very helpful.  You may not think of downtown Phoenix having a sushi hotspot,  but it does with squid ink."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour prices!  There are select rolls on Happy Hour but we were able to find a few from those options that we were happy with.  We had a California roll, spicy crab and shrimp tempura.  All were very fresh and flavorful.  My fav was the spicy crab.  The kids split the chicken teriyaki kids dish and I was plenty...With an added bonus of ice cream at the end.    The edamame app was a great size to share...we got two orders bad probably would have been ok with one...although for $2 each we grabbed two!    We may have found our new happy hour place!"}
{"text":"One star for decent green and black ices tea and for bringing chopsticks and napkins to the table.  Walked by a bar with a buch of single guys who are obviously the regular bar tools.  Get sat outside at a table so out of level I took a landscape rock and propped the leg.  Nice server with her trendy shoulder tattoo (now you play a game to guess which one I'm referring to).   Ordered a kobe burger and a sushi plate....20 minutes later....no food. Wtf...burger takes 8 minutes tops and we were one of six tables with 2 servers. The place was anything but busy. First out is the sushi plate and the burger is MIA. Not sure why you would bring out only half the table order. Five minutes later the burger arrives and it is raw. Flat top or grill was too hot and cooked the outside so fast it was still blue and sticky raw on the inside. Server is no where to be found. Then we try the sushi....unfortunately a table guest is asian and a culinarian and points out the rice mush. They cooked it too long with too much water.  The sushi had rice paste underneath it.  Server appears and I explain my medium burger was raw. She looked perplexed when I asked to have it sent back and remade.  Another 20 minutes goes by and no burger, no server, empty drink glasses. Ridiculous.  She reappears with a new burger and fries. The fries were cold.  WHY CAN'T THEY GET ANYTHING RIGHT? ????????  REALLY?????? IDIOTS.  Burger is cooked to medium well, but the moron layed the bacon on top of the burger while it cooked (assuming to warm it) and burned it black. Basic toasting or browning of the bun was non existent so nothing to counteract the aoili making the bread soggy. The spicy aoili was the only decent flavor in the dish.  Top it off its a PREMADE supposed kobe burger. Terrible.  Wish you could see the burned bacon and the machine formed patty in the picture.  Again the server goes missing in action, we thought maybe be she got picked up by INS or something. I walk up front and the d-bag late 20 something guy is flirting with the 16 year old hostess. No wonder this place is crap. I explain my server is MIA and the food and service is terrible.  I get looked at like I am speaking Mandarin or something.  No apology, no attempt to remedy or help the burn.   So sad. It could be great and it could be a destination place....too bad management is under qualified and under engaged.  All the great reviews are obviously by the happy hour d-bags at the bar previously mentioned.    Save your money and time.  You can get better sushi and better service at the sushi kiosk down the street at Frys or in the cold section at Costco."}
{"text":"Great Place! When I was living in Phoenix I was there about once a month. 99% of the time the staff was great and super friendly. The food was always wonderful and there menu is changing for the better each time. I also worked for 2 of the big hotels in Downtown and would send as many guest as I could who were looking to eat out late or just a fun place to eat/drink. The mix of Asian food and a sports bar is wonderful and being open late also a big bonus as this is Phoenix where everything shuts early. They are also pet friendly on the patio for your 4 legged loved ones to join."}
{"text":"Hit this place up on a recommendation from a friend whom we were out in Peoria to see. This place was great. We had a sweet server named Ashley, and even though we were sitting at the sushi bar, she was awesome. The sushi chef also answered any questions we had. The sushi rolls were so different, and delicious. Mom had this cougar roll, that was wrapped in cucumber.    Overall, amazing services, great food, and if we are out there again we will definitely be going there again."}
{"text":"Contemporary sushi place in Cityscape. Good for a work lunch, but pricey otherwise. Sushi was decent but not good for the price. I had the Dirty Rockstar roll and selection of nigiri. Not worth driving to Downtown Phoenix for but okay if you have a meeting in the area."}
{"text":"We were surprised when we walked in, it was really stylish inside and had great atmosphere - loving the clear chairs! I liked that the place was both family friendly and good for couples. The happy hour was from 3 - 7 pm and features half price apps, cheap beers, and well drinks.   We split the pork gyoza (dumplings) as a starter.  I tried the veggie roll which was delicious! (if you like veggie rolls).  My boyfriends'  vegetables with chicken & udon noodles was cooked perfectly, good quality chicken!!   Overall I was surprised to find this delicious little spot in this part of town, which appears to be filled with cookie cutter corporate restaurants for the most part."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi eaters and non-sushi eaters alike. Their menu caters to both. The sashimi with grapefruit, shishito pepper, tempura green beans, avocado roll, tootsie roll, buffalo chicken roll (yes its buffalo chicken in sushi form) are all good. Great patio with live music too."}
{"text":"I didn't eat the food but my friends were not impressed with the portions or the speed of the service. Their consensus was that the sushi and potstickers were ok but the rest of the food was bland and luke warm. The waitress seemed to be having a rough night and it may be due to a holiday rush. That said, I may not consider coming here again if other options in the area are available."}
{"text":"We sat at the sushi bar and ordered from the chef.. we had rolls that were very good.   However we were eating our last roll and one of the guys was cleaning up and spraying cleaner as we were eating....was really trying to enjoy that last roll...it was only 7 o'clock and they close at midnight?!?  That was the only thing I didn't like, but made a difference..."}
{"text":"Was there last night when checking out super bowl central. They were decently busy but got right in and sat on the patio, good people watching with the events and ice skating right there. Heater on patio kept us warm, which was nice. Food was good and it had a cool atmosphere. The live music on the patio was really good! Down side was the service and cleanliness. The girl serving us was awful - took three times to ask for water until the busser finally brought it out half hour into us being there, never brought us napkins or utensils (had to go get it myself), never once checked on us until the end when she tried to butter us up for a tip. Blah I hate servers who just expect 20% for shit service. I would have left 5% to make a point but my friend couldn't do it. 10% is eh service, 15% is ok service and 20% is great and anything more is well deserved for going above and beyond. But this day in age, everyone expects at least 20%. Squid Ink wipe your soy sauces bottles down, it was disgustingly sticky.... And clean house on your entitled servers. There are tons of kitchy sushi places with much better serve that I can go to."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi bar, ambiance was right on the spot. Started off with garlic edamame, real tasty and plentiful. Followed with a variety of rolls, the Cougar and Surf n Turf  were the best. Topped it off with the bread pudding for dessert and climbed to heaven with each bite. Definitely will be back and try other sushis in the near future."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious, but the service is not the greatest. Our server recommended non-vegetarian items as vegetarian options. Our food took a very long time to come out and then half of it was missing. But as I stated, the food is very good!!!"}
{"text":"Good stuff.  Great lunch specials and fresh sushi.  We enjoyed our long, leisurely lunch while our puppy enjoyed a cold bowl of water on the patio.  Bartender was friendly and atmosphere was nice.  Salmon sashimi was delicious so we ordered 3 orders.  Check in offer gave me half off a glass of Sauvignon Blanc which was so good I had a to have a few.   Highly recommend for a great meal in downtown."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and really like this place.  In a sea of downtown bars full of TV sets and burgers, this is a nice island of relative tranquility.  Now at wintertime, you can look outside the window and see the skaters in CitySkate.  While there may be a TV at the bar, I don't see or hear it at any other table, and see nothing but their funky murals or other patrons enjoying a skillfully made meal.  I've generally just ordered sushi, which is presented without adornment on shiny white porcelain of different shapes.  Everything tastes nice and fresh, the nori is nice and crispy, and they are inventive with different combinations of house rolls.  Just don't expect to be in and out of here fast.  You generally can expect an hour's stay, even on a not-too-busy day.  But that's ok, good sushi should be savored, with the eyes and the mouth.    I once got green tea ice cream for dessert, and the serving was very generous...enough for 3 people.  The service is always friendly and professional.  Expect to pay a bit of money.  This is fresh fish in the desert, not a McDonald's hamburger.  Set your expectations accordingly and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't think we will have any reason to go back and some may find my complaint petty but when I go out it's the little things that can make the biggest differences. I will start by saying that the dirty rockstar roll was good. We wanted to try the sautéed garlic edamame to start but they brought out the regular one instead so we ate a couple while waiting to switch it and placed the empty shells back onto same plate. Well guess what came back to us when they brought the garlic edamame.... a new plate with gigantic chunks of garlic, no flavor and the same chewed up empty edamame shells mixed with our plate. Just stick with the basic salted edamame because there's more flavor. I had to ask 3xs for a cold glass for my drink & overall there's a lack of good beer to select from. The patio is nice but honestly I'm not thrilled with squid ink overall..... sorry."}
{"text":"Good but overpriced. A little too trendy/ try-hard...better/cheaper/fresher sushi across the street at doraku. If you are looking for a fun bar for happy hour, this is a good spot. If you are looking for great sushi, look across the street at doraku."}
{"text":"This sushi bar is small & cozy, modern, buzzing, and sheik and at 7pm, it was crowded but seating was available for my very hungry party of 5 in just 10 mins. time! Impressive response time from the wait staff! They seat us and the waitress came right over. She was very attentive and helpful with our choices. We ordered garlic edamame for appetizers - it was on. Wifey's Hibiscus Lemonade was the bomb...and so was my sake bomb! The nigiri tako sushi was tasty, perfectly chilled, and fresh! Tuna sashimi was deep red and had the perfect cut & texture - pretty fresh for the desert! LOL! The Surf & Turf Roll was so ono-licious! Seared Filet Mignon, shrimp tempura, asparagus, avocado, and sweet soy topped with fried shallots - a must try - cuz i will again! The kids had a decent menu - a California roll meal, and some teri-chicken plates. Sorry, (808 ppl) no mac salad. DOH! But they hooked my 2 young ladies up with hot fudge vanilla ice cream sundaes afterwards. Oh, and then my son and wife had some strawberry ice cream mochis! Our waitress turned out to be the owner's sister, Abby! Thanks Abby! Awesome dinner! We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"i was just visiting the Peoria area and had noticed this restaurant driving by...being a fan of sushi we went the last night of our trip. we went kind of late on a monday night, so the place was pretty empty inside.  most people were at the bar or outside.  the waitress was very nice and helpful and lots of fun to chat with.  our sushi was wonderful, fresh and very creative.  i ordered 3 different rolls and they were all great!  my friends had cooked items and loved both.  one had terriaki salmon and the other teriaki chicken (they did try a bite of my sushi!)  and both said their items were cooked perfectly. this is a wonderful local sushi bar!"}
{"text":"Loved this place for happy hour sushi. Good place to take friends and family for a good sushi spot. Rolls were 5 stars and service was friendly and informative. Really liked the atmosphere and was comfortable. The bar was very busy which is good to see. My only criticism is that by the time drinks, sushi, and dessert combined the bill is still sizeable even when on the happy hour price! But worth it in my eyes for a good treat every once and awhile!"}
{"text":"Wowza! Stopped in for happy hour with my boyfriend, and by that I mean we showed up ten minutes before it ended on a Sunday... It wasn't very busy but we were seated and greeted promptly.  Their happy hour is a GREAT deal... 1/2 off all apps?! Yes please. We ordered garlic edemame, potstickers, salmon sashimi, beef  something or other and the cod. Portions were perfect, presentation was spot on and everything was amazing... My only issue was the beef was a tad on the chewy side, but it didn't matter because the COD. Oh my mouth watering God, the cod was Delish! Like next time we go were ordering two orders bc sharing was painful!  I can't speak for the sushi because we didn't have anything besides the salmon sashimi but if it was any indication then it definitely will be tasty...  We weren't drinking but HH included some pretty sweet deals as well on drinks... So happy we checked this place out... As sushi goes in North Scottsdale this place beats the pants off of anywhere else (meaning their happy hour specials)...  Definitely will be returning and SOON.  Oh and bonus: the patio is dog friendly!"}
{"text":"Good drinks, okay service, mediocre food, good live music on Thursday- Saturday. Like other yelpers indicated, this place is overpriced. I think it's a good place to hang out for Happy Hour from 4 pm - 7 pm or just for drinks."}
{"text":"Our first visit... Love!  Great food and atmosphere.  Staff was friendly and efficient.  Came with my young girls... PB&J sushi rolls?  AWESOME!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to rooftop yoga at the Palomar, and wanted to grab dinner nearby afterwards. We were looking to eat something lighter, so we stopped into Squid Ink. The decor was very nice, clean, & modern and our server was great.  We opted to sit at the sushi bar and ordered a yellowtail roll, tuna roll, garlic edamame, and beef & broccoli. The sushi rolls were good, but a little pricey at $7 per roll. The garlic edamame was very flavorful. However, the beef & broccoli was pretty disappointing. While the beef & broccoli were cooked perfectly, it was pretty much ruined by the sauce. The sauce was way too sweet, and the dish was drowning in it.   Cooked dishes don't seem to be their forte, and the sushi is little bit pricier and no better than a few other sushi places in Phoenix. So I will most likely only return for happy hour, as their regular priced options are not a very good value."}
{"text":"Very slow service, was not busy at all. I eat sushi 4-5 month all over the valley and country, this was probably the worst.  Rice tasted days all and hard, and tuna & spicy tuna had NO flavor. If you like Sauce.. They Drown rolls.  $90 and first time ever we didn't clean the plate!"}
{"text":"BRB my taste buds are dragging me back to this place... Victor, ask for him, he's awesome..."}
{"text":"So good! I am craving this place now whenever I go to Cenpho for a show.  I had the Hawaiin Something and the surf and turf. YUM."}
{"text":"Our server Nathan was super nice and helpful! He gave the best service, thank you for showing us great hospitality! The food was axing as always. I am vegetarian and he recommended the vegetable undon I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great sushi food was awesome.. service was good bar is super nice will definitely come back bartender was super nice made us some awesome drinks"}
{"text":"First time here and the customer service was great. Our server Harland was very informative on all the sushi and had great recommendation! I will for sure be visiting again."}
{"text":"Poor service, 30min ticket times in a slow night, then A cucumber roll with imitation crab for $15. You should be ashamed of yourselves... pull it together!"}
{"text":"Not a 5 star place but a 4 star for sure. The food is good and I especially get the salmon bowl which is great compared to the restaurants near by. Not too crazy on the seating but it's okay"}
{"text":"Squid Ink Sushi is one of those places that makes you feel like you're an upper class patron which is surprising considering the relatively low prices. I went there on a busy Friday night and got my staple of Miso Soup, Flying Fish Roe, and Salmon.  The presentation was wonderful, everything had a very clean atmosphere. The food was delicious but not the best I've ever had. The Miso Soup looked tastier than it actually was, but it was still a 4/5.   While I found that the service was very quick, it was a bit too much. I had several different people at least 2 different waiters coming over to me asking how my food was. It was delicious but there's a fine art to service and asking if I need anything between gulps isn't going to win over the casual diner.  The price was actually cheaper than one would expect from a Sushi place downtown. Perhaps the presentation let me to believe it would be more expensive than it actually was. While that's a good thing for the consumer, it might turn away prospective customers.  I'm still looking for great sushi restaurants in the Phoenix area, but for the price and location there's very little that Squid Ink Sushi does incorrectly."}
{"text":"Love this place - and not just for the sushi and great good, but the atmosphere and service are top notch!  I am a regular for these very reasons.  In addition to their sushi, highly recommend their Miso Black Cod and Pepper Crusted Filet!  Bomb."}
{"text":"I'm torn over what rating to give. When this place first opened I gave it a solid 5! Prices were good, food excellent, service on point. Ever since then... Prices way to high.. we literally used to come here 2-3 times a week. Now maybe every other month. Can't afford it anymore. Food still good, but I can go somewhere else get good food and a drink that doesn't break the bank. It's a $$ bummer."}
{"text":"Service terrible. Sushi par at best. Better sushi places out there. My salmon sashimi had bones in it."}
{"text":"It is OK....pricey and the rolls are smallish. Service is marginal. Outdoor bar is cool....The name is a little odd too. Anything that is excreted from a sea dweller is not associated with being appetizing. How about \"fresh fetish\" or \"the green sea\" or \"the lovely roll\".....probably just me. I never leave this place feeling like my experience was congruent with my bill.   I gave this place a 2 star and I went back there with my wife for date night. She wanted sushi and we have few options in Vistancia.  It was better. I was pleased with my evening. Miso soup is good. I went a few times in the first year of business....so they may have been working the kinks out. Need to recognize improvment when it happens."}
{"text":"I've been to Squid Ink several times & have always been happy with the service & food. Just came in today & the cleanliness was not good. We ordered two martinis & two glasses of water. All the glasses came dirty with finger prints & I could tell my martini glass had lipstick stains on the glass. The top of the tables looked clean, but the edge of the tables were sticky & had soy sauce stains on them. We had to move to another table because we had bugs flying around our drinks & food & bugs flying into our soy sauce. This is the first time I've seen this restaurant dirty. This is the Squid Ink in Peoria, AZ."}
{"text":"This was my favorite sushi spot until I tried actual legitimate places. The sushi here is basic, not gross, but very simple. Nice place to take a first timer but nothing more."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and always had a great experience. This experience began as one of the worst. We walked into the restaurant at about 9:30 pm and went straight to the sushi bar to eat, as usual, and we were soon rudely greeted by the hostess who said \"for future reference you have to wait at the front to be seated\" and she threw down the menus and left. There was nobody at the front to tell us we needed to wait to be seated, which is why we walked straight to the sushi bar to sit. About 5 minutes passed and we were actually talking about leaving when the same hostess came back and handed us waters, said nothing and left. Shortly after we were greeted by a very friendly waitress who took our drink order and then another waitress came over to take our food order. Both were extremely polite and friendly. Our food and drinks arrived in a timely manner and the sushi chef was awesome. Our first impression and greeting was horrible and I would give that part of our experience a single star, but everything after that was great and deserves five stars, so I am averaging this visit as three stars!"}
{"text":"Pretty good service, fun people watching on the patio, but it stops there. The sushi and sashimi we had was pretty bad. The fish didn't taste very fresh, and it was so salty it was practically inedible. It tasted like the chef dumped an entire salt shaker worth to maybe disguise the older fish.  We Never plan on going back to squid ink for the sushi."}
{"text":"We ate at Squid Ink for first time this past week-end.  The restaurant was bright and clean and really liked the decor. The sushi was just right and I highly recommend tofu starter. The best part was our server Dave. He was attentive, helped us order a new drink we might like and checked in with us just the right amount of times.  The happy hours prices made dinner and drinks afforedable.  Lately most servers we meet in central phx has been average at best but Dave will be the reason we re-visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant was simply amazing.  The food was delicious, the workers so warm and welcoming and they were great with my dog. Totally recommend it here!!!"}
{"text":"YUMMMM!!!  I was visiting Phoenix for a couple of days (staying at Kimpton) and yelped places near me. I was craving Japanese so this was literally right next to the hotel and an obvious choice. I was BLOWN away. I got the Beef Short Rib and it hit THE. SPOT. I also got miso soup and it was really good. So good that this is where I ate my entire stay. I had some sushi for lunch the next day and it was great then went back to the Beef Short Rib for dinner again with delicious green tea ice cream. I had take out all three times and they were super fast even on a Friday evening (15 mins). Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place and great food.  Nice vibe.  The service had a lot to be desired though.   We were there with a large group but still in should never take almost 30 minutes to get a glass of wine.  And then to be charged the wrong price."}
{"text":"Cosmopolitan sushi spots aren't hard to find in the valley.  Heck, you can find well over a dozen trendy fashion forward sushi spots just within a 5 mile radius of Downtown Phoenix.  The atmospherics can certainly be tantalizing, but sadly too often the sushi itself is not.  Places like Hana and Harumi Sushi are two of my valley favorites for sushi mainly because the focus is on the product, not on the aesthetics.  Squid Ink is a west valley sushi spot which opened a second location in Downtown Phoenix a couple of years back.  I've passed by it countless times on my way to a ballgame or downtown event.  But for sushi, I've almost always gone up the road to Harumi.  But on a Sunday for lunch, I decided I'd give Squid Ink a shot.  Located in the Cityscape development on the northeast corner of Central & Jefferson, Squid Ink's Downtown location strives for a look of urban sheik even before you walk in the door.  Ample street side patio seating outside, with options for seating at the sushi bar, their drink bar, in a booth, at a table, or even a high table against the window as I chose.  Altogether I'd guess the restaurant can seat at least 100 at capacity in this long (somewhat narrow) space.  The interior itself reminds me of a number of trendy sushi spots I've been to in the Scottsdale and Paradise Valley areas.  Its a look that's certainly pleasant to the eye, but does the food match the atmosphere?  Valley chef (and Scottsdale Culinary Institute grad) Schuyler Estes is the proprietor of this business and has honed his craft at valley restaurants like Christopher's, Cowboy Ciao, Four Peaks Brewery, as well as numerous Asian seafood restaurants.  How does his rendition stack up against a myriad of competitors?    Things got off to a rather rocky start when I went to use my Yelp check in for half off a draft beer, but the waitress told me they don't honor that on Sundays.  Odd.  There's nothing on the Yelp check in that states that condition.  Nevertheless the waitress was insistent that they won't honor it today.  Welp, dock off one star for that.  Let's hope the rest of the meal is a better experience.  Sushi is certainly the mainstay here, but the menu also features a fairly robust selection of apps and some decent lunch specials.    For my app, I went with an order of their potstickers.  Five pork dumplings covered in scallions, ginger, and soy sauce.  They also threw in free miso soup alongside.  The potstickers were super tasty.  Plenty of pork inside and the potstickers had a nice smooth clean skin on the outside.  The miso soup was also quite good with a tasty broth, though I think they went way overboard with the number of mushrooms they put in the soup.  Note to Squid Ink: less mushrooms, more miso broth.  For the main course, I went with the sushi lunch special.  A chefs selection of a sushi roll, 4 pieces of nigiri and sides of ginger and wasabi.  I honestly couldn't say with 100% certainty which fish the chef choose, though I'm fairly certain my roll was the Spicy Crab roll.  All of the fish were plated perfectly for easy chopstick pickup (no forks here unless you ask, and I didn't ask).  All the fishes were delish and the lunch portion is pretty healthy.  Still hungry, I went a little off the reservation and ordered their Rice Pudding Brûlée for dessert.  They mix vanilla ice cream, coconut milk and sticky rice together, then cover it with a creme brûlée style brown sugar crust and seasonal fruit (in this case, strawberries).  An unexpected dish to be sure but I actually really loved the rice mixture.  I think the coconut milk in particular helped to mellow the rice in a such a way that the cold chunky texture was more pleasant.  Total cost for all the food including tax and tip came to about $40.  A pretty reasonable price for all the food I got, all things considered.  As mentioned earlier, I can't give them a perfect score mainly due to the Yelp check in snafu (if you're going to advertise a free check in special on Yelp to lure customers in, you'd better honor it if there's no restrictions listed).  I would still say Harumi is my favorite of the numerous Downtown sushi spots as I'm a fan of the no frills places that dish out high quality stuff.  But if you're looking for a spot with good sushi, good happy hour specials and an urban sheik atmosphere, Squid Ink has you covered (particularly at lunch time).  I've had fantastic sushi, and I've had God awful sushi.  For me, Squid Ink falls somewhere in the upper middle echelon."}
{"text":"Great sushi and ambience.  They have extremely reasonable happy hour prices that they offer daily.  Staff was friendly and they made my children very happy."}
{"text":"There are a couple of secrets on this menu.  They aren't standard sushi, but damn, they are pretty good.  The manager, Dave, suggested I get one of his favorite, and it was not something I would have ordered, but it is probably something I will get every time I come.  It was the Beef Negamaki, which is found under. \"Small Plates\" section.  If you find yourself wanting something outside of the standard nigiri, get the Beef Negamaki."}
{"text":"Not terribly impressed by the food but not super disappointed.  It was only okay for me.  Our tempura rolls kept falling apart as if they weren't rolled properly and that was a little irritating.  The place itself had really cool decor, however the fishy odor it had was very unappealing.  I understand there is raw fish everywhere, but I have never been to a sushi place where the smell was THAT strong and gross."}
{"text":"Yummy food and fairly good prices.Wait staff and such are awesome.  Love the decor too!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi Bar, you have to try the Cougar roll!"}
{"text":"First time here. Not a sushi person so not sure how it tastes. I did have the chicken & vegetables that comes with rice but asked for half noodles too. It was good not a fan of the teriyaki sauce and they burnt alittle the chicken so it felt hard."}
{"text":"Sushi is just alright. Service leaves a lot to be desired. I stopped with a group of six, 3 couples. We all placed our order and their food arrived but ours hadn't. Apparently, the waiter took it to the wrong table TWICE! After waiting 40 minutes for sushi, we got fed up and left. Ended up eating at Burger King down the street."}
{"text":"I ate at Squid ink for first time tonight and it was amazing! I am a texture person so there isn't a lot of sushi I will eat but their food is awesome!! Not to mention the view I was very impressed with it. My server DAVE was an incredible server and very friendly and attentive. I had their bread pudding and there are no words to describe how awesome it was"}
{"text":"This sushi joint has the perfect little vibes to it. The location and decor is nice, the food is good, and service was wonderful too. My only minor complaint is that it's really expensive for good and normal sushi. I love the miso and the garlic edamame is amazing and yes the sushi is good but not the most amazing thing ever ya know. I will come here because the whole package is great but I will only come during happy hour for better prices."}
{"text":"Terrible to nonexistent service: bartender Lou did not greet us we had to greet him. Only interested in the single girl and talking about how much money he made in old town and getting drugs on the dark web. Food was okay: rockstar roll was really good very spicy! Seafood dynamite roll was terrible, we already paid so good ol Lou did not offer much in terms of compensation other than \"we'll find this a good home\" as he took our uneaten roll away. Which in my understanding of restaurant terms means us employees are gonna smash this in the back. He offered us a free beer in place of the $15 roll. We were ready to leave and declined the beer so he said next time we come in to remind him of this incident and he would \"hook us up\". I'm a manager at a sushi restaurant and this is just ridiculously terrible all around. Poor service ruins the experience. If the food was great I would have looked over Lou's short comings but unfortunately this was not the case.  I will absolutely never come back to squid ink."}
{"text":"Food? Service? Atmosphere? Meh. Side note bartender gets visibly annoyed when you use the check-in promotion. \"Sorry bro must be tough to have to look at my phone screen and then touch a button.\""}
{"text":"First time at Squid Ink. Stopped for pre-movie dinner for three on a Friday night. Arrived at 6:30, before happy hour ended and got good deals on beer and some rolls.   The restaurant was fairly full so we took seats at the sushi bar and were seated right away. Our server was training a new server and it did not detract from our experience in any way.   We ordered drinks, two apps and seven rolls and the bill came to $68 before tip which was a really good deal. I got a beer, shared the garlic edamame and potstickers and then ordered a spicy crab roll and spicy tuna roll.   The edamames were very good with a perfect dusting of kosher salt and some cloves of roasted garlic. They were steamed just right. The potstickers were amazing. There were five of them and they came in a tasty teriyaki sauce with scallions that was divine. The pork filling was cooked perfectly and had a hint of garlic.   My rolls were big, fresh and cool while the cucumber was crisp and bright. The best touch was the black sesame seeds mixed into the rice, which gave it a great nutty taste that rounded out the flavor. It was just the perfect touch.   I recommend Squid Ink for an evening dinner or late night snack."}
{"text":"I have come here several times for a nice nightcap of sushi and drinks.  Service at the bar has always been good, food is good, and I keep coming back.  I have been here while events are going on in the adjacent street and, since the bar opens to the outside, have listened to music from those events and neighboring venues.  There is a parking garage below (enter from the north) that has a free electric vehicle charger and Squid Ink will validate your parking garage ticket so that's free too."}
{"text":"My first experience I must say was not good. A group of friends met here and we ordered several different things.  We ordered two spicy tunas and I think one was not fresh, my friend advised our waitress, Corey and she said she would take care of it. Well that did not happen! She brought the check and my friend reminded her she was going to take care of it and her words \"I am not trying to pull a fast one\" I will take care of it. We advised how to split the check and my friend went to the restroom.  Corey came back to the table and said \"a tuna roll is not accounted for so I paid it.  When my friend returned from the restroom I told her what happened and she could not believe she did not take care of it. We ordered eel sauce that seemed as though it was mutating in front of us and Corey even said \"oh that is definitely not good and took it away and brought another side of it although no one was really interested any longer. I must say Corey did buy the table green tea ice cream \"great gesture\" however it does not make up for the seemingly dishonesty with the tuna roll. We will never go back to this establishment. We all work in customer service industry and this experience was very poor."}
{"text":"The service was good. The food was average.  Had an app and a sushi platter,  mixed bag."}
{"text":"Hmmm...very trendy sushi joint  Positives:   The Edamame portion was about half again as big as lots of places, so everybody had plenty.     They have plain iced tea - no frou-frou-fruity junk.   The fish on the nigiri was fresh and tasty   They have a variety of fancy rolls, for the crowd who is into that (mayo, etc.)  Less-than-postives:   The fish portions on the nigiri were small (reminded me of Yasu)   The fancy rolls that we tried were mostly overly sweet   The nigiri was listed as \"Tuna\", \"Salmon\", \"Yellowtail\", rather than Maguro, Sake, etc.   The 'music' was really loud and made it difficult to have a conversation   The waiter didn't like sushi (ummm...why are you working there, dude?)  If you're looking for a fun place to hang out with a bunch of friends, this could be just the sort of place you're looking for (unless you want to have a conversation with them without yelling).  If you're looking for really great sushi, then maybe look a little harder?"}
{"text":"Let's start with the positive...they are open late on Sunday night's and the garlic edamame is incredible! The rest of the food was not...but more importantly, their service will be the reason we never go back. Save your time and money...go to Harumi!"}
{"text":"Good mix for those who love sushi and those who may not.  Husband loves the dirty rockstar roll and daughter the california and spicy crab rolls.  For me, not a big sushi fan, but a lot of options on the menu I can choose from - my favs the potstickers and wonton soup."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this place is modern and oriental. We sat at the bar and enjoyed people watching as it looked on to the street, so naturally we grabbed drinks and watched the passerbys as we waited for our app. Although the place is a tad pricey, the service is good, and the ambiance is upscale. A large selection of rolls to pick from and the skewer we had, although just a single one, was tasty and nice to order and nibble on while sipping the cocktail.  i did feel like the cocktails were pretty weak. For the price of everything and quality care put into sushi, I wish the cocktails weren't so weak.  all in all i enjoyed my visit and will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious and reasonably priced. A very nice menu with plenty to choose from. Great outdoor seating that you can enjoy the city escape scene."}
{"text":"Victor was AMAZING!!!! literally came to check on us when we asked him to. Really took care of my friends and I. Great personality, people person.. never felt bothered at all!! We were the annoying group with the messy saki bombs and he never complained. Will be back and ask for him!"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi and drinks!  I went here for my birthday before the Daniel Tosh show. We had a big party of 10 people and they sat us at the coolest table. To start it was a circular table that had a huge rotating lazy susan in the middle, so we could share our food. That was such a genius idea!  That had a ton of cocktails for women and men. My favorite was the Tokoyo something, it was a perfect mix of citrus and sweet! The service and food were great and timely.   I will definitely go back here for sushi next time I go down town."}
{"text":"Been here many times because of its convenient location next to my house. Every time I go I tell myself I will never go again. Service is absolutely horrible, from not getting served at my table twice and forgetting things I have ordered and pretending that they didn't forget it. Food is good tasting but the service makes the place not worth a dime of your money."}
{"text":"Been going to Squid Ink for 7 years since in my neighborhood. Tonight went for the Monday/Tuesday $20 bottle of wine and Roll special. They were out of the Pinot Noir for that special and even though they had Pinot Noir but not the one for the special. I asked what then thinking they would offer something close but got nothing. It wasn't cool. I asked four times are you sure thinking she would offer me something special for the special they advertise on a Monday night. Then I had to hear patrons next to me drop the F bomb constantly and be loud and drunk and they were friends of the bartender making it even worse. The owner obviously was not there this night April 17th."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I always get the veggie rolls they make and sometimes the soup. Always good and consistent. I have done togo a few times and it has always been perfect everytime. Cute location with a nice patio and bar too. Will be returning multiple times. So glad i found this place"}
{"text":"I went here for happy hour with some friends. The bartender, Austin, is really great. He gave me some cucumber drink called \"Poder Verde\", which was awesome. The food wasn't as good as the drinks. It took too long to come out and something my friend ordered never showed up because the kitchen was backed up. At least she didn't have to pay for it though."}
{"text":"First visit.  The sushi here is great.  Dynamite roll, Pokemon roll, Dirty Rockstar roll...all very good. Loved the jalapeno on the Dirty Rockstar.  From a food perspective, this place seems solid.  However, service needs major work.  The waitstaff is dressed like a Nine Inch Nails video, which may be a theme thing, so whatever. Chicks in torn pantyhose, if that's your edgy calling card, have at it. I'm fine with it. I'm a guy, what can I say?  But the professionalism of the staff is questionable. They hire young, attractive people who would otherwise be in an Abercrombie and Fitch, which I think is some kind of youth outreach program or something. I think the guy we had just quit Abercrombie that morning. Like, he was folding sweatshirts that morning, got hired and started at Squid Ink that night with no training. He was a really nice guy, meant well, so I can't blame him. I blame management. We waited quite a while to put in our sushi orders while he was running around helping other tables. I even tried to yell out to him, but he must not have heard me. When he did come over, he used a clean plate on our table to write notes on his order pad. OK, that's not the end of the world, but it's pretty unclean.   All these little things just added up to poor training. If management reads these reviews, take note."}
{"text":"Went for first time today. Loved it!!! Great sushi and great menu items. Had the roster garlic edamame as the app and WOW!!! Great variety of sushi and menu items. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Love the food atmosphere and staff. The whole experience every time I visit here is a pleasant one. If your looking for a good sushi place come here!!!!"}
{"text":"Great new addition to downtown Phoenix!  We have stopped in a few times already and have been very impressed with everything we tried.  They offer an extensive and reasonably priced happy hour, so highly recommend checking it out.  The edamame and potstickers are quite good and the rice bowls are tasty too."}
{"text":"Brian is an amazing bartender! Very fast and efficient. Love to come to the bar and see him because I know I'll get great service!"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife and her friend after a 3 on 3 basketball tournament.  Star 1 is for the food quality. I got the chicken wings. You might be thinking why would you get chicken wings at a sushi place? They were recommended by a friend and they were to die for. The sauce was amazing, the meat was tender, and the ranch dipping sauce was awesome! My wife and her friend got some sushi and said it was okay but nothing to go out of your way for. The star here is based solely on my experience.  Star 2 is for the service. Our waitress always made sure we had what we needed and were taken care of.  Star 3 is for the atmosphere. The atmosphere here is a very cool place to hang out with a group. It is set up in a cool way and there is pretty loud music playing the whole time. It's not some place I would go on an intimate date because I would get way too distracted but it was fun to go with my wife and her friend.  Star 4 is for the food being worth the price. We went in during happy hour which is from 3 to 7 every day! So I got a full order of amazing wings for 7 bucks.  Star 5 is for the wow factor. The wow factor here is for how great the wings were at a sushi place. I would go here again just for the wings."}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi spot!  Great layout, clean, well staffed. Has a great atmosphere from the moment we walked in the door. Friendly server, great sushi and decent prices.  GREAT : Miso dumpling soup                 Cougar Roll - So different from regular sushi, very refreshing!!!                 Phoenix Roll - Pepper sauce was interesting, in a good way!                 Tahoe Roll - Yummy, strong crab flavor GOOD :  Kale salad - was recommended by server, not as special as I had hoped for for $8...  If you are in the mood for sushi, definitely try this place. Worth the extra drive, we spent an hour in the car for it."}
{"text":"Great for a late night quick sushi fix downtown after a Suns game or a concert... Prices are reasonable..."}
{"text":"I have had:  Wings Shrimp Tempura Dirty Rockstar roll  All were awesome. Those wings though...   Close to the Harkin theater so a great date spot too."}
{"text":"I enjoyed everything about Squid Ink.  The decor was unique, the staff was very kind and the menu full of choices.  I ordered the daily special, Fire Breathing Dragon, and one of the sushi dinners.  It came with a sample of many of their sushi all of which I enjoyed.  I have no doubt I will become a regular, once I can find more friends who enjoy sushi..."}
{"text":"This place is more of a club than a sushi bar. I went with my family because we had gotten gift cards for my Dad's birthday.  First off, the service was TERRIBLE. The wait staff were more interested in talking to each other and the cooks than making money for the business. My dad's dish came out cold. We waited at least 50 minutes for food. When we tried to use the gift cards, we were told that we couldn't, and then when we argued with the server and just asked her to run it to see if it worked, it did.  The food quality was not good whatsoever. I got sick after eating their sushi. Judging by the other reviews, it looks like both service and food quality are severely lacking."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour wanting to love it. The place wasn't that busy and once we were seated it took nearly 20 minutes for the guy to come over to just get our drink order. After waiting forever we got out 4 rolls and 2 appetizers....not good  Sushi is bland. No taste its just like mush. When ordering salmon you expect it to have a clean fresh flavor. Not here everything was very blah. Not very much of a selection on happy hour but we decided to try a variety of different hings but no matter what it was nothing had any flavor at all!  Then we couldn't find there server for nearly 30 minutes I had to chase down a hostess just so we could get our bill after asking her for the third time to get our check she finally showed up with it. Do not go here the service is bad and the food stinks!"}
{"text":"My sushi friend and I went for our 2nd sushi meal today and we were incredibly annoyed and dissatisfied by the service and even the rolls.    There were only 4 tables of people in the dining room (one person sitting at the sushi bar) and 1 waitress.  I think there was one hostess as well.   When we first walked in at 3 pm, the start of happy hour, we saw a sign that said they'd be closing at 5 for their staff holiday party.  We are attributing this to the horrible service we received thinking they were too busy getting ready for the party and in a hurry to get us out of there so they could enjoy their party.    It took about 3 minutes to be seated (again...there were only 3 other tables of people at the time).  Then once we were seated, we waited about 6 minutes to even get a waitress to come over and get our drink order...and all we ordered was water!  Again, we then waited about 5 minutes to get the water and for someone to come take our order.  Once the person came over, who happened to actually be the bartender, we ordered garlic edamame and told her we were ready to order our sushi.  But she walked away and didn't come back for another 10 minutes or so to take our order.    The garlic edamame were not garlicky at all.  We paid more for the garlic version and there was barely even a hint of extra flavor.    We ordered the Cougar Roll this time after seeing so many people order it.  Not only was it not what the hype made it out to be, but the cucumber was very overpowering and the shrimp was quite fishy tasting.  We also got the Buffalo Chicken rolll, which isn't exactly sushi, but we were unimpressed.  The combo of the sticky rice and the heavy chicken (which were in tempura...yum!) wasn't quite right.  The buffalo flavor only lasted a few seconds b/c the sauce was only drizzled on top of the rolls...I think it would have been soooooo much better if the chicken had been covered in the sauce instead.  Last but definitely the least was the Jibs roll.  I loved the tempura of course and the cream cheese, but it wasn't really that flavorful sadly.  :-(  All in all, we paid $40 for our 3 rolls and the edamame and it was way too pricey for the horrible service and the not so tasty rolls.  It was not worth the price or the drive.  I won't be returning at all after this latest experience.  I have way too many other favorite sushi joints closer to my home that I love and experience better service with."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi - you can never go wrong with this place. My favorite is the surf and turf roll. I also had a cocktail which i can't remember the name of, but it had ginger in it and it was just delicious. Everything is good here! The potstickers are to die for as well."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about a dozen times in the past year. The food is consistently very good. The service is consistently bad. When I say bad, I mean they are not attentive.   My gf and I just went on 10/3/14. We were there for an hour and a half! It took 10 minutes to get a Kirin light. We made the mistake of telling the server we needed a few more minutes to order our food. She comes back no sooner than 10 minutes later.  When the food came, we didn't have any ramekins to put our soy sauce and wasabi in. I had to get up and go ask a random server for some  Our daughter decided she needed a knife to cut her chicken with and some extra teriaki sauce. No sign of our waitress 10 minutes after our food arrived. I had to get up and go ask a a random server for teriaki and a knife.  Waited another 15 minutes to get the check and ice cream for kids.  We will not be back. We are taking our business to Sakana."}
{"text":"Staying downtown at the Renaissance and walked to Squid Ink. I got the Pokémon roll and the Avocado roll. The Pokémon roll was something like I have never had-layered taste and texture. The Avocado roll was terrific."}
{"text":"Does anyone else fist pump when an unexpected check-in offer appears? Squid Ink Sushi provides Yelpers with 50% off the purchase of your first beverage.  We stopped in around 5pm for some Happy Hour sushi and wine. We sat on the patio, which wasn't the best choice with the constant noise of the Metro buses stopping directly in front of Squid Ink, and the vagrants who could hit you up for fifty cents so they can \"catch the bus\"--but that's not Squid Ink's fault.   I'd like to recognize our server Stephanie for the great service received. She was very personable and timely with everything.  We had the Tempura Calamari appetizer, which was satisfying in regards to the freshness of the squid and the complement of the spicy aioli, but the batter was just bland and lacking in any form of seasoning. We then split the Horry Fook and Philly rolls. Horry Fook roll had great texture with the firmness of the jumbo shrimp and the crunchiness of the tempura breaded jalapeño, but again the tempura just lacks in flavor.   Unlike most places downtown, Squid Ink has Happy Hour seven days a week from 3-7p."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times now because it's close to my house and the sushi is delicious. The service is hit or miss, I would not go expecting great service.  Ok, so the food ... their miso soup is the best I've had, better than Ra, Stingray or Sushi Brokers (which is where I eat most often because they are close to work for lunch).  I really like the fried tofu and green bean tempura appetizers.  I can drag my husband and daughter (not sushi fans) there because they also have teriyaki bowls and a pb&j roll for kids.  For lunch, I usually get the sushi special, which is a spicy tuna roll and a few pieces of nigiri.  I like the spicy crab roll and shrimp tempura roll on the happy hour menu.  I did not like the Philly roll, it was weird and chewy.  I still need to try the spicy salmon roll and California roll.  Prices ... about the same as in Scottsdale ... sushi is expensive, which is why I try to eat it for lunch or happy hour.  The happy hour is ok, but a little disappointing.  There are limited rolls available for the 1/2 off special, and you basically have to drink beer if you want to get a good HH deal.  The wine is only $2 off and most of the wines are $8 a glass, so I don't think $6 is a good HH deal.  Also, I ordered a Hana Awaka Sake and I don't think it was included in the HH, which was a little confusing because it was listed right under the wine.  Ambiance ... I don't care for the interior it's kind of cheap Ikea looking.  The bar area and outside patio are pretty cool.  I would say more trendy than upscale."}
{"text":"First time here and mostly definitely not our last. We had the grilled squid. Actually we had 3 of them!!  The dish is delicious!!  We also had the shrimp tempura roll, Vegas roll, tsunami roll, salmon nigiri, and spicy tuna hand rolls. All were fresh and so yummy. We tried the Thai chicken fried rice. Also tasty.   We finished with a Hawaiian bread pudding which was warm sweet and a great way to end our great meal. Service was super friendly and the place is chic and contemporary."}
{"text":"The ravenous roll was amazing; the service equally so. The place is open and bright l. Great place to stop in for lunch by yourself or with a few co-workers. I was in and out within my lunch hour."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, good food, drinks were amazing too! The waitress and waiter was on point with checking on us and customer service! The skinny older bartender was a grumpy person. Not so great with the attitude problem so I wouldn't sit at the bar. He seems like he would strike up a negative conversation. He was wearing a white or light collared shirt. Didn't look like the normal bartenders there.    Wish he didn't serve me so I would have given this restaurant a 5 star.   I would done here again if I didn't have to see that negative guy."}
{"text":"First time yelp-ing about this place, but I've been more times that I can even remember...literally more than 25-30 and I love it every time. Squid ink gets it all around. Great service, amazing food, and super timely with everything.   I've had a few things on the menu and each one of them has been amazing. Do not come to Phoenix and miss out on Squid Ink."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix for a conference during the Memorial weekend, so my friends and I were walking around downtown to look for a place for dinner. In the middle of the downtown square, we found Squid Ink. The first thing that grabbed my attention about this place was the set up and the atmosphere. The interior design was very modern with multiple artworks around on the walls. They also had outdoor bar seating with television screens showing sports games. The overall vibe was very modern and chill which I really enjoyed. The menu offered variety of option including unique sushi rolls and other fusion cuisines such as Kobe burger, which I ordered. Although this place mainly served sushi, I've been craving burger for awhile so I decided to risk the odds and order. Contrary to my worries, the burger was amazing. The bun was thin and the meat patties were very thick, which I personally prefer. The sweet potato fries were crispy and fresh, and the two unique sauces that came with the fries also complemented the entree very well. I would've loved to try the sushi rolls as they were not your ordinary \"rainbow rolls\" you see in any other sushi restaurants, but unfortunately I will have to wait for another chance to visit Phoenix. All my friends seemed to have enjoyed their food, and we all definitely left the place being satisfied. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive to our needs which made our experience even better. If you're new to sushi, I would highly recommend starting at Squid Ink, as their menu is very fusion and not too traditional."}
{"text":"I'm torn on this restaurant.  I have been twice in the last 3 weeks or so.  My first experience was amazing.  The service was fast and friendly.  We tried many things on the happy hour menu and enjoyed everything.  They had a photo booth that was fun to take pictures in.  Liked the bathroom - unisex concept and the one way windows in the door.  My second experience was horrible.  We were seated in the round booth and ignored for about 30 minutes.  I seriously thought about getting up and leaving.  Even after we were noticed the service did not improve.  The food was not on the same level as the first time - perhaps I was already grumpy from bad service?  Photo booth was gone...  Tried -   California Roll - daughter liked it so much she ordered a second serving Spicy Salmon Roll - just learning to like fish and the chunks of salmon were to big in this roll Miso Soup - delicious Cucumber Sunomono - so glad they make theirs with just cucumber.  the flavor was spot on. Roasted Garlic Edamame - so yummy with large chunks of garlic Agedashi Tofu - don't care for bonito so ordered it without second time Green Bean Tempura - good, fresh green beans but a bit to crunchy on the green bean.  Would have liked them blanched more before battering. Crab Rangoon - Great first trip.  To large chunks of crab second time for my preference. Beef Negimaki -  Very small portions.  Not visually appetizing to me.  First visit equals 5 stars. Second visit equals 1 star.  Torn on if I would try it a third time."}
{"text":"Finally.  After 5+ years of having a place down here...we have a top shelf sushi joint to frequent ! The fish was fresh, service was prompt, drinks were cold. Not sure what else you would want in July in PHX! So happy this place \"did not suck\" tonight.  We look forward to going back  MANY times. Congrats downtown PHX for finally having a big league sushi place in your midst!"}
{"text":"Normally we very have poor service at this location, but we gave it another shot tonight and we had Eric as a server and he was phenomenal. He was very nice and attentive the entire time we were there. The food is always good but customer service is the most important part of a business and Eric portrayed all the aspects of an excellent server and I hope this location hires more employees with a solid work ethic."}
{"text":"Went there the night U2 played they were slammed but the food was great and the service was good as well. Kate our bartender did a great job. Loved the Dirty Rockstar sushi."}
{"text":"Squid Ink never disappoints! The service is always great, I've never had any problems with slow service or staff. The food is great and you can't beat Happy Hour 7 days a week from 3-7.  It's the only spot I go to for sushi, and I've got all my friends addicted!"}
{"text":"Service was good. My filet mignon was only a 3 star at best. For the 30 dollars I spent on it I expected slightly better. Sushi was ok I've had better."}
{"text":"Kenneth, our busser, was of high intelligence, we asked a question of the difference between the powder wasabi and the \"fresh root wasabi\". He answered appropriately. I see a great future in Kenneth. I'd definitely bring my other girlfriend here and my wife at the same time it's that much fun! The food was alright. I really liked eating the ginger by itself due to the texture of the tuna t'was a bit more rough than expected. Overall restaurant without Kenneth 8/10 but Kenneth definitely made the experience beyond 11/10!!! He's incredibly handsome with a low percentage of body fat making him the best candidate to choose. He also knows how to speak to the ladies, he almost snatched my girl! Dave is also great as well! Very welcoming staff."}
{"text":"Sushi was very delicious I will definitely come back 10 thousand times, loves the arugula salad very different"}
{"text":"The only person that seemed to know what was going on was the busboy.  After the busboy sat us we went into a black hole of service.  We waited for 15 minutes and then left."}
{"text":"First time trying sushi the California rolls and avocado rolls were amazing I also had a deep water cocktail which was great. only down fall was the server who never asked if we needed refills or if we would like anything else my Honey had to actually walk up to the serve and ask for eel sauce which was really good. I still gave this restaurant a 5-star because the food was amazing"}
{"text":"Squid Ink had exactly what we were craving. Fantastic special house sushi rolls, some edamame and an amazing Hawaiian bread pudding dessert. Nice server that seemed spread a little thin. Had to remind her several times for requested items. Left very satisfied with a great meal."}
{"text":"Vegas roll = clutch  Dirty Rockstar = amazing Excellent service Good sake  Also, the happy hour is really good."}
{"text":"Since our first visit to Squid Ink about a year ago, we have been back 10-12 times. Every single time the food has been amazing, and their conscientious attitude towards allergies is very appreciated! We have taken several new initiates with us since, and so far they have all liked Squid Ink as much as we have. Do yourself a favor and get the roasted garlic edamame - it's to die for! Definitely our favorite sushi restaurant in the valley."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Really quick and friendly staff, particularly in the bar (only place we've sat). Fresh & delicious. Try the crab Rangoon & the tootsie roll!"}
{"text":"\"CAN YOU HEAR ME OVER THERE??\" This place was actually really good compared to other sushi joints. Great Happy Hour and the service was outstanding. Would definitely recommend the Dirty Rockstar Roll. They have a cool kids menu as well with things like chicken teriyaki and a PB&J roll.  We went on a Thursday and they did have live music which was a guy and his guitar. Great singer and guitarist but very \"interactive\" with everyone. Asked people on the side if they could hear him several times so we found his vibe a bit interesting (almost awkward) at first and then just rolled with it.  Kids liked him playing different songs so all good.   Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wasn't overly thrilled by the sushi. I wouldn't go back for it. Also the restaurant was really hot and I'm normally cold!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Especially the happy hour specials from 3-7pm. The wait staff is very attentive and makes every effort to ensure your meal is pleasant. The last time I dined here with my girls for a GNO we met the owner and he was very friendly, approachable, and involved in his business. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Service was great but food was just ok. If I lived closer I would consider going again but lots of better restaurants are closer."}
{"text":"Lots of fun roll choices. Probably would give 5 star if service was a little better, but it was decent. Would return!"}
{"text":"We came here on 11/29/14 because our favorite sushi spot, Harumi Sushi (which I now highly recommend) was closed after Thanksgiving, Squid Ink was a short walk away.   -Service was lacking, don't sit in the back corner or you'll be forgotten.  -2 stars only for the chefs/quality of the food.  -confusion on tables  We sat long enough to completely review the menu -details of rolls and all- before our server greeted us. He got our order then took the order of another table before dropping ours off. Which wouldn't be an issue if he hadn't later blamed the kitchen for the 25 minute wait, the other table got their meals before ours. After bringing by our food, they didn't ask if everything looked okay...not noticing we didn't have soy sauce, which he grabbed from another table with patrons still sitting at.   We also witnessed other tables receive 'edamame on the house' while others did not.    While we waited for our final roll, another server almost delivered us another table's food. We watched her leave our roll at a table for 2-4 minutes, come back..pick it up..and bring it to us.    While the decor and location are great, the good would be worth the price if the service was better. Walk over to Harumi. You won't get a quartz bar and patio seating, but you will have amazing service and better foods d spend less."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with some friends and had a great experience! The food was great and the owner was very friendly. He even brought us a bottle of Apple Saki! It was delicious! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Sunday night  place was almost empty. We ordered 3 rolls. The kitchen did not have an ingredient on 2 of the 3 rolls we originally ordered.  So we changed our order. The rolls we ended up getting were tasty.  I wish I could say the same for our service.  Waitress was polite but just that. Polite.  I felt like we were getting rushed out.  As soon as the last piece of roll left the plate, the plate was immediately removed.  Like I said, the food we ordered was very tasty, but the experience as a whole was just mediocre.  They do close at midnight on a Sunday night and was walking distance to our hotel, which is a plus."}
{"text":"Defiantly one of my new favorite sushi joints. Great atmosphere, friendly & accommodating wait staff, & the fish is so fresh! The rolls here are very unique, & yummy.  If you can't make up your mind on which one you want, just ask your waiter, they are always willing to tell you their favorites."}
{"text":"Love it, its a great trendy sushi bar.  The food was excellent and had live music and was very clean.  The waitresses have always been great and for a sushi bar and the price of the food and sake it was really pretty great."}
{"text":"The toro roll and \"dirty rockstar\" were amazing.  The server almost checked in too much.  The drinks were reasonably priced.  This location is a clone of the Peoria and phoenix locations and is just as good level of service and food.  I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Loved it! The sake was the best part, it was some of the best I have had in while. The carb and shrimp was also on point. California rolls were amazing for being a basic roll. The service was also very good, quick and also great!"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Yellowtail sashimi was fresh, rock star sushi was great. Nice to meet Greg tending bar. A guy with great character."}
{"text":"Upscale, trendy ambiance. Fast, friendly service. Our first visit, impression was fresh, quality seafood but a bit lacking on flavor and high priced. The two of us spent around $80 for lunch, I  had 2 glasses of wine my husband two beers. Second visit proved more successful. We ordered again off of the sushi menu. It was well presented, unique & we were pleasantly surprised by the arrangement of flavors."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here a lot.  Great lunch special!  Good value.  They do a great job trying to make nights fun.  Open mic nights and different events keep things fresh and entertaining.  The food is good.  I recommend giving it a try if you are in north Peoria."}
{"text":"Good sushi place for Downtown. Service was great. Nothing really stood out besiedes the loud music."}
{"text":"No complaints on the food or our server. Both were excellent. Disappointed with the Manager though! It's pointless to make reservations because if there is a group before you - they can take as long as they want & your group will have to wait.  We politely spoke to the manager who stated the table was already bused & they were just waiting - he had already \"attempted\" to ask them if there was anything else they needed. We waited 45 min before we walked to the table and politely talked to the group. The group had no problem clearing out & stated they weren't told anything about leaving nor was our reservation mentioned. They gladly got up and let our party sit. Yes, the manager gave us a round of free drinks, but not having to wait 45 min would have been better. I hope that his approach will be better in the future. Food & hospitality from the servers helped give this another star."}
{"text":"I have now experienced Squid Ink 3 different times. My first visit was right when they opened, loved it, not the seating or the chairs, but the sushi was amazing. I raved about it.   The second time, the sushi got sloppy and and service was slow. The chairs were still uncomfortable and the seating was weird.   The third time, was also my last. The sushi was mostly rice and fake crab, and that was all of the rolls we ordered. The portions also got a lot smaller. After paying upwards of $100 for 3 people, we all left disappointed and still very hungry.  *On a side note, the \"how was your service\" card that came with the bill already had the service rated as a 5. not sure if it was the last customer or the sever trying to be sneaky, but they should check those. I really did want to fill that out fully this time."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, a very nice sushi bar, and the bartender had some nice tatts. The sushi, fresh and well prepared. There's a nice view of the street from the open air sushi bar. The servings were generous as well. The music was also humming at precisely the right enjoyable volume. Definitely a must do destination if you're looking for sushi downtown. A plus rating."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times now, I drive from downtown Phoenix to come here. They have a location in downtown but I feel like this location is nicer and the food is more fresh, I enjoy the Pokémon roll and dragon roll you can't really go wrong with these two, the staff has been really friendly so that's why I make the 45 min drive to come here :)"}
{"text":"I've been here on a few occasions now and I must say that I was impressed. The sushi wasn't the very best I've had, but it was made with fresh and quality ingredients. The dragon roll is amazing. It's a must have!   There aren't a lot of good sushi places here in Peoria but this place makes up for it. It's usually pretty busy so be prepared to wait a little bit for a table. I don't mind waiting for good food though.   The wait staff is kind and courteous as well. If you're looking for great sushi in Peoria check this place out."}
{"text":"Stick to the basics that have a high likelihood of good execution. Stay away from the trendy/stretch stuff (e.g. the grilled squid appetizer) - order that where you've developed confidence in the restaurant.   ATMOSPHERE: fine, nothing mind blowing. Solid music imo.   SERVICE: good-natured and fairly attentive. No complaints.   FOOD: the short rib was very good. Presentation was average but it's 99% about the taste, and it was great. Melts in your mouth. However, the reason behind the 2 s was the \"grilled squid\" appetizer. The calamari rings were not right - truly like eating leather, I can't articulate it any other way. Not sure if it was undercooked or just poor quality. I'd rather have a restaurant with consistent, average, predictable food than one with a strong entree but an seriously off-putting appetizer.   PRICE: non-sushi is reasonable, sushi (especially nigiri/sashimi) seemed exorbitant, even by New York standards. Perhaps that's a function of PHX being relatively land-locked."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst meals I have ever had. The tuna tataki was really over seasoned, the citrus yellowtail was a poor flavor combo, crab rangoons were rubbery, and the two rolls were terrible. The only EDIBLE item was the gyoza. The quality of the sushi is very poor. If you are looking to come here for quality fish - look elsewhere. They didn't have any green tea but the sever offered us earl gray or apricot vanilla - lol. Don't think we will be going back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent as the staff gave excellent suggestions as well as pleasantries. They were incredibly friendly. I loved the delicious Pokémon roll I heard recommendation of."}
{"text":"This is the closest sushi place to our house, so we tend to stop in here frequently. We go here only during happy hour because it is a bit too expensive otherwise. What is disappointing is how much their happy hour has changed over the last couple years, it really is not much of a deal anymore. Their food is good though, the potstickers are amazing, as is their Kobe burger. The service is hit or miss, but most of the times it is a miss. Most of the hostesses, waiters, waitresses, and bartenders are fairly rude and unhelpful most of the time. We have had a couple good ones, but that is on a rare occasion. Also, besides the bartenders, we have never had the same waiter/waitress, each visit has been a different one, so it seems that they have a lot of turn over. Their beer selection also tends to leave a lot to be desired. They always have Sapporo and they have various local brews on tap, just never many good ones. Overall this place is okay if you are craving some sushi, but definitely do not go out of your way."}
{"text":"***3.5 STARS!   I have to update my review because I keep coming back here for more and more. The service I receive here has been top notch lately, even at the sushi bar which is the only place I sit every time I come here. I think the trick is to always dine-in and everything is all gravy. Think twice before you order to-go. I feel the quality lacking when it's to-go in my opinion. They have recently changed their menu. Mostly good things. The biggest change I noticed was in their ramen. Instead of always pork ramen, it is now \"chef's choice.\" I was quite disappointed in their chicken ramen. Not nearly enough flavor for me. For the future, I decided to call in before coming in for ramen from now on because their pork ramen is the #1 reason I keep coming back to Squid Ink. Reason #2: you will get the most bang for your buck with their Spicy Tuna bowl. It is $13 which is pretty pricey but it costs less than most of their House rolls but comes with eggplant tempura, asparagus, and topped with avocado. MAKE SURE they don't forget ponzu sauce (has happened to me before) because it is the icing on the cake in this dish. Squid Ink feels like a splurge every time but portions are fair for the price and it is in a great location downtown."}
{"text":"So I don't know how sushi is in arizona my husband and I just moved from California coast. There is some awesome sushi there :)  The sushi here is ok, I wish it was better some nights it's better than others. What I really come here for is there happy hour appetizers those are great!"}
{"text":"Both service and food were good! We had the Thai chicken fried rice, smoky and big chunks of chicken. Then a tempera shrimp roll and the surf and turf, so good!! The surf and turf melted in your mouth and the sauce on it was excellent. Maybe a little on the pricy side but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"For the start the chairs are very uncomfortable...metal and hard.  The serve was slow for it not being busy. The sushi I had much better at other places....not coming back.  Still waiting for the dessert 12 min and counting...."}
{"text":"Without a doubt one of the nicest patio bars in the neighborhood. You can get your sushi on here inside, outside or on the patio side of the bar. The environment is always clean, the help bright and cheery and the food is solid!  Great sushi options and the rolls are filled well. Try the wings and the garlic edamame. Both are done right!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  They have a decent happy hour with some sushi rolls offered at half price.  I had the sashimi salad and it was delicious.  I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like the Thai Chicken Fried Rice, but it was salty, mushy, and just not good.  I've had chicken fried rice in the form of a frozen dinner that tasted better.  And, seriously, if I am paying $11 plus tax and tip for fried rice, I expect it to come with more than 3-4 small pieces of chicken.  I actually ordered it because I thought it was something on their menu that couldn't be messed up.  This place has really gone down in quality of food and service since it opened.  I will not eat there again.  I also really do not like the fact that they leave their soy sauce containers sitting out in the sun and heat on their patio (I work in the area, they leave them out every single day, all day).  They've been doing that for some time; apparently someone needs to get sick to before they will take notice."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Great employees, wonderful sushi, astounding interior. The only reason why it loses one star from me is because of the serving size. If you order any of the nigiris, you only get 2 of them for the price of $5 during Happy Hour. Prices are a bit expensive, but at least the two $$ is accurate."}
{"text":"This place has really great sushi as well as other items like their chicken wings. The restaurant is always fun to go to for food and drinks."}
{"text":"This place was horrible! We eat sushi at least once a weak. The Sashimi had a fishy odor and taste. Good job squid ink I won't be having sushi any time soon thanks."}
{"text":"Food was quite decent, no complaints. The cucumber mojito, although a delicious and refreshing cocktail in the past, came out made with flat soda...twice. The bartender was obstinate. Disappointing.  Hopefully a only one time incident..."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for lunch or dinner for quite some time now. They can be hit and miss with the food. I usually order the grilled salmon plus some sushi. Some times they overcook the salmon. Sometimes it's perfect.   Anyway, the price is moderate.   The service can be a little slow at times."}
{"text":"Squid ink downtown Phoenix is a delight. You can smell the delicious food from around the corner. I've only had the excellent sushi and lovely cocktails made by the blue haired bartender, but I sincerely plan on exploring the rest of the menu, namely the sesame kale salad, the Kobe burger, the beef yakisoba and of course the ramen. Check the happy hour (3-7pm) for all kinds of inexpensive and awesome food & drinks."}
{"text":"I love love LOVE this place. It's down the street from our apartment! The happy hour menu is great and we left feeling stuffed with delicious meals! We started off with shisito peppers and seaweed salad which was a delightful way to start off our meals. I then ate the spicy crab roll and my fiancé ordered the Kobe burger and can I just say it was AMAZING!!! The best part that made us feel comfortable was out fabulous bartender. I believe his name was Lou. He was so nice and made amazing drinks! Usually bartenders won't spark Up conversations but he was very friendly. We will definitely be back because of the hospitality! Thanks again Squid Ink!!!"}
{"text":"I went there tonight and had their wings and burger.  Both were awesome.  I always get my wings extra crispy and very hot with blue cheese.  They didn't have blue cheese but I reluctantly ordered anyhow.  The wings were neither crispy or very hot.  The set up was perfect for a disaster.  As it turned out, the garlic ranch was pretty awesome, and the wings fell off the bone.  They were extremely tasty as well.  Needless to say, quite a nice surprise.  The burger was fantastic as well.  Not a huge selection of beers, about 5 in total but the pumpkin kilt lifter and IPA were good.  Bartender actually was there for more than just a paycheck which is odd these days."}
{"text":"Walked into this place thinking it was going to be good. I order the grilled calamari and it came out cold and it had a really bad taste. I got the sushi lunch special and the server was rude when she brought out the soup that came with the lunch especial spilling it everywhere. No one asked if the food was okay or anything. I will probably never return to this place. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Prices are getting a little high though. Wings and miso soup are amazing"}
{"text":"I give it the highest recommendaton of any restaurant in downtown Phoenix. Not only do they have both traditional and unique sushi options, it's high quality and (unlike other sushi restaurants) offers a full bar! Drinks are great, they have the usual sake and japanese beer options as well as a fabulous cocktail menu, plus their happy hour is totally worth it! I've been going there for several years, however, I now work in downtown Phoenix and can't help but stop by several times a week. Their bartenders are so friendly and even remember the names of their regulars and their preferences. One of the bartenders, Brian, not only remembers my name, but knows exactly how I like everything when I get my to-go orders; all of their bartenders and hosts remember me and always make me feel welcome. The manager Adam goes out of his way to make sure customers are satisfied and orders are correct. I only know him by name because I had a minor complaint about my take-out order in the past, and he not only corrected it, but has since always ensured my order is correct when I come in. They care about the quality of their food and the satisfaction of their customers...something that can seem hard to find in all restaurants these days. I could go on about how much I recommend them, but frankly I'm going to go back to enjoying my leftovers from my visit earlier today!"}
{"text":"I have to say, after moving to Arizona a couple of months ago, I instantly fell in love with this place. This particular experience however was not impressive in the slightest. My sister and I had gift certificates here and decided to kick the weekend off early with happy hour.   We ordered our usual, and started to dig in. I noticed a small black hair on a piece of rice on my chopsticks. Instead of making a scene like 90% of the population would have done, I simply asked for new chopsticks and a new plate and returned to the rest of my food.  The rest of the meal went alright, until my sister noticed a similar looking hair in a piece of avocado. Now I was disgusted, and slightly annoyed. We decided at this point we were finished. I politely pointed out both pieces of hair to the waitress, graciously explained that I understand that these things happen, have worked in the industry for years and insisted everything else was alright.  She promptly removed the food when we said we were finished. The check was dropped right after. I understand things happen in restaurants, but was disappointed that we did not receive an apology from management. I don't believe that I'll be back anytime soon"}
{"text":"We had the Spicey tuna roll, Tsunami roll & Dragon roll....YUMMMMMY & FRESH!!! Sitting at the indoor bar & had great service too. A wonderful experience!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here before a concert downtown.  It was crazy downtown cause there were a number of things going on but we came early and found an empty spot at the bar, which is open seating.  We were immediately given menus by the bartender, and then forgotten about for approximately 20 mins.  It was so busy in there we couldn't even get his attention.  The lady next to us had been given her food, but no silverware, and was sitting waiting for 10 mins or so before she could grab someone's attention to ask for chopsticks.  I know downtown gets crazy on event nights but I do wish these places would prepare a little better. We finally placed our order and sushi was served promptly but we'd also ordered a hot appetizer which was nowhere to be seen.  About 10 mins pass by and they finally bring the 'hot' app which was ice cold.  The whole ambiance felt very disorganized and I got the feeling my appetizer should have come with the sushi but was forgotten, hence why it was cold. I ate it anyway.  Flavors were good but would have been been better when warm. Ambiance is great, as is the location. Prices are high, even for HH.  The sushi is good but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This place is all show and they cant deliver. They offer you \"cucumber water\" with one measly slice of cucumber.. lol. I had the duck and it was so unseasoned and fatty. The portions are small.. left here hungry. My husband had the coconut shrimp was average but shrimp was overcooked.  The only reason for tha 3 stars was for the amazeballs breadpudding! Shit just melted in your mouth along with the ice cream.   Place is overpriced tho, the sushi did look good but not enough to get me to come back."}
{"text":"I met a few friends here for a quick happy hour.  I can't really speak much about the food since I didn't really order anything.  I tried my friends garlic edamame and it was well seasoned, but under cooked.  They have a decent happy hour.  I like that they have happy hour until 7pm.  I also tried my friends sushi rolls and they seem ok.  I will probably give them a try again.  Some of their dishes looked interesting. My only issue was that my server forgot to bring my drink.  After she brought everyone else their drink, she forgot about mine.  When I asked her for it, she said \"Oh, they didn't bring it to you?\"  Who are they?  She was my server...why would anyone else bring it to me.  It's  ok that you forgot...just say so.  :-)"}
{"text":"I loved the ambiance and the food!  The service was average at best.  It was our first visit and we were pleasantly surprised at the great food quality and will be back. We hope they pay attention to improving the service to the level of the food quality."}
{"text":"Great food, sushi, drinks. I was alone on travel so i sat at the bar and every single person who worked there spoke with me, and engaged in some way. That was really nice."}
{"text":"I came here with 3 other people. Ordered a couple rainbow rolls, duck confit, miso soup, scallop hand roll and a couple other items. Overall the experience was good. The server was super friendly and would definitely go back because of her (she's the one with the Chicago tattoo and Cubs earrings). The sushi was good, but I certainly wasn't blown away with the quality. There could definitely be an improvement in sushi quality and taste. We'll give it another shot in he next few weeks to see if it was just a one-off. Let the record show that my brother absolutely love the duck confit."}
{"text":"Crab rangoons: pretty good but very much like an Alfredo sauce inside, and pretty salty. I didn't try the sauce that came with it, it just looked too hot. They came out ooey gooey inside and crispy outside though, overall, I'd have them again.   Philly roll: very good. Everything a great Philly should be. Smooth with a gentle crunch at the end, and love the smokiness of the sesame seeds!!  Surf n turf roll: I feel the beef flavor gets lost behind the tempura, but for those who are nervous about raw fish, this is something fun everyone can enjoy. I asked for no sauteed shallots on top and feel this is a much tastier way to get the roll, but that's my personal taste.  Hamachi: fresh. Simple. Crisp. Delicious!!  The service was friendly on a mildly busy wednesday afternoon. Attentive and my glass was never empty. Music was very relaxing, but again, it's 435 in the afternoon."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, reason why I'm giving them a 1 star is because my bill was $33.40 and when I gave them my card the waiter came back with my card he charged $48.78, I asked why my bill went up to $48.78 he said \"oh let me fix it\" he came back and gave me two copies one for $48.78 and one for $33.40 said he charged an additional $33.40 and cancelled the other transaction. I spoke with the manage and he told me that my money would be back on my account today (Monday) I was there on Friday, so today I still show the 2 charges on my bank acct so I called the restaurant and the manager I spoke with said it will be 3-5 business days! This is so unacceptable bad customer service!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered this through Postmates delivery service. It was really delicious! Our favorite was the new style citrus yellowtail sushi and the zushi box roll. Least exciting was the seared tuna new style and dirty rockstar was just a little too hot for our taste even after removing the fresh jalapeño. Highly recommended. We will be eating here again for sure."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a friend while visiting Phoenix. I very much enjoyed the food and customer service. This place had a nice vibe and I loved the outdoor bar seating- the weather at night was amazing. This is a nice place for a simple date or just a place to hang with friends. There were also tvs at the bar! The food was priced well and very tasty. You won't regret choosing this place! It's right in the heart of the town next to the arena and other happening spots! I would definitely come back here if I ever visit Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. Had a black rice sushi roll and was satisfied. I'd peg it as a great \"quick-stop\" for lunch. Liked the black rice so much that I bought some at Sprouts :)"}
{"text":"If you think eating sushi in a land locked state like, Arizona, is weird - well, it's not. It's not bad, but it's no Nobu.   Stumbled upon this place after a craving for sushi rolls came over us. We were skeptical at first, but were pleasantly surprised. We ordered more food than we could finish, but everything was decent.   Fries w/ nori powder = surprisingly tarty! We ordered skinny fries vs. steak.   Gyoza = eh. Nothing spectacular. I'd order another plate of fries for an appetizer.   Hamachi nigiri = decent slice of fish. Rice was ok. Nothing special, but I'd order it again.   Sashimi salad = I didn't have it, but the two in my party who had it, loved it. Nice slices of fish on a bed of lettuce in a bowl.   Dragon roll, spider roll, Philly roll = standard, but no wow factor.   Tuna overload = yum! Spicy tuna on the bottom, topped with chunks of big eye tuna, wrapped in cucumber. A refreshing tasty bite!   Hory fook, buffalo chicken sushi = I know, BUFFALO CHICKEN SUSHI?!?!!! Pass on BOTH sushi rolls. The Hory Fook lacked taste (not sure what it was) and the buffalo chix sushi was just...odd.   Miso salmon = DELICIOUS!!! Moist, tender, sweet tasting salmon. Yum! Served on a bed of rice and sautéed mushrooms, broccoli rabe and carrots. The salmon and veggie mixture was superb! The rice on the other hand? Not cooked all the way. A little disappointed."}
{"text":"the decor is sleek and modern.  the squid and nancy (fried calamari) and fried green beans are great!  smaller portions (rolls and sushi) than typical and slightly higher prices, but fits the upscale design..even down to the unique plates!!  I have been pleased with the service..it's a great place to meet friends or a large group!"}
{"text":"Good food. Price is a bit much for portions but over all good experience. Only option for area besides doku and that's not a choice lol."}
{"text":"Overall not particularly impressed with Squid Ink's food.   The decor and interior of the restaurant is very awesome which makes this place a great place to hangout however the food falls short.  Tried several rolls, poke style bowl and ramen. The dishes are a little deceiving as they look beautifully presented and ingredients are fresh, but they lack in flavor and in the case of the ramen it seemed they tossed ingredients into a bowl but none of it seemed to come together. Bland taste throughout all the dishes.  On a funny side the ramen came in an enormous bowl (the kind you might use for salads at home)!!  In regards to the service, it was definitely not the best."}
{"text":"Serious let down. Squid ink had reached out to a large group that I am a part of. (an unofficial fan club of Phoenix Comicon with over 10 thousand members) to do a cross promotion with us, Phoenix Comicon, and themselves. They had promised our group leadership an official roll for the event. We spent weeks promoting them to our members, and when we began to arrive, the staff was completely clueless in regards to any promotion and there was no themed roll made for us.   We easily sent them hundreds of people tonight and they completely let us down. I will never return to this business."}
{"text":"good drinks, i wish i could remember the bartender's name she was very sweet & hooked us up w/ the check in special. pretty good sushi....."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at Squid Ink, and I was pleasantly surprised with the ease in ordering compared to other sushi restaurants. The waitress was able to quickly answer any food related questions we had, and the menu was clear regardless. I appreciated how quickly the food was served, and the portions were fair in regards to the pricing. I definitely recommend this spot to both sushi and non-sushi fans (serves food other than sushi). It's an interesting scene, with a bar-like area and a few tables outside in the heart of CityScape to enjoy the meal outside. Overall, it was fantastic! It would be best for a date or groups under 5 people due to the limited and intimate space. Probably not the place for children. The dessert menu is bare with just three items, but the sushi seems filling enough to allow you to pass on dessert anyway.  ORDER THE CRAB RANGOON!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great atmosphere. We got the Pokemon and Tahoe roll, very good. The only negative I would say would be the wait time to get a table. We waited almost 40 minutes, which to me is a lot of a sushi place. However, well worth the wait. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Decent late night grub spot downtown. I enjoyed the food and the bartender was generally friendly. We had a good time drinking and relaxing while looking into downtown. Food came out quick and fresh. Nothing too memorable here."}
{"text":"Hip decor. Hip music. Bad food. Not a Japanese person within eyesight. Overpowering sauces attempt to disguise low quality fish. Should have known when I sat down to find zero sake on the list. Humph."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant. Seating both inside and outside is great. If you sit outside, they do have heaters available. The servers are so nice.  Happy hour is daily from 3-7 pm. The best items on happy hour are the starters and alcohol. Definitely try the garlic soybeans - if you like garlic (baked garlic cloves), tempura soybeans, and tofu (all are starters).  They also validate garage parking."}
{"text":"Nicole, our waitress was awesome! She was very attentive and kind. I ordered the Vegas rolls and they were perfectly prepared. The service and food is on point and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was impressed!! As you know living in San Francisco your palate gets spoiled especially with all the awesome Sushi bars in the city!   We started with drinks: When ordering this particular drink you have to say it with meaning!! HI-YA!!!!! Karate Chop mode! Try it..  HI-YA: Raspberry vodka, vanilla vodka, orange vodka, melon liqueur, blue curacao, lemonade and Sprite. It was very tasty!   PINK GRAGON MARTINI: X rated liquor, Nigori Sake, Lemon Twist, Triple Sec. Again, can't complain.   You should definitely try:    HORY FOOK ROLL  Two shrimp tempura and avocado, topped with spicy tuna and fried jalapenos  SURF N TURF  Shrimp tempura, spicy crab, asparagus, topped with filet mignon, truffle salt, sesame aioli, eel sauce and scallions  DIRTY ROCKSTAR ROLL  chopped spicy tuna, habanero, avocado inside, topped with big eye tuna, fresh jalapeno, sweet chili sauce and spicy aioli"}
{"text":"The four stars are for food!  One star for background music.  Loud Rap at 6:30 pm on a Friday?    For me, this place is for lunch only.  However, congrats to the chef....their sashimi is cut nicely now and served attractively.  So somebody is listening.  Not to the music, tho."}
{"text":"Positives:  muddled cocktail is sublime.  Service was friendly and attentive.  A variety of menu items at different price points.  A great environment & stylish moderndecor.  Negatives:  the food.  It's nothing special.  Lots of highly stylized menu choices, where the title outdoes the reality."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi & bowls ! Great service & friendly staff  We highly recommend your Resturant ?"}
{"text":"This place has location going for it, good service, but the quality of the fish, and selection is sub par."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! It was our first time there and not only will the food will bring us back but the bartender was AMAZING! When you go sit at the bar and make sure Bryan is working he is the best ;)"}
{"text":"Their sushi/sashimi menu options were very different and adventurous compared to the sushi places I usually go to. Changed the way I will ever look at raw fish.  Would recommend the Pokemon and the Dirty Rockstar sushi. To die for!"}
{"text":"A great way to spend a sunny Sunday. Service was friendly and the food was delicious. We tried their signature buffalo chicken roll (a delicious take on sushi), the ultimate philly and dragon roll were quite tasty as well. Can't forget to mention their garlic edamame.... I'm getting hungry again just writing this. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm hard to please when it comes to sushi and I loved this place!  We sat outside and I ordered their Vegas roll.  That is my all-time favorite roll and not every place can make it taste good.  The place got my approval.  The drinks weren't bad either, if I remember correctly a little bit strong but not over the top and was still delicious.  Considering it was Scottsdale the prices weren't outrages and were more expected.  The waitress we had was very nice, edgy looking which I liked.  They let my date and I hang around even though we could tell they were ready to close up. But not once did they beg us to get out so they could go home.  They were very kind with us being the last ones to leave."}
{"text":"We thought we would try this place out for the first time.  We ordered two dinners to go.  When we got home we found that there was no sauce on either dish.  My husband drove back up with the food and the girl up front apologized and got us sauce in tiny little containers.  The Short Rib Rice Bowl sauce was supposed to be braising jus reduction....the sauce that was given was a watery broth and was obviously taken out of the fridge because it was ice cold.  Meanwhile, our meals were cold as well and had to be reheated by this time.  It's too bad because we've heard good things about Squid Ink and we were excited to try it.  Neither meal was great on flavor and not that they had to but there was no compensation for us running back and forth for their mistake.  For $15 dollars plus per dish it should have been a better experience."}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to head out for a Saturday bait date. We're relatively new to the whole sushi thing as both of us swore for years we didn't like it only to find out we love it.   First, any place that has a Saturday night happy hour is A-OK with me. Squid Ink's is 3-7 and 10pm to midnight. Every day. And the deals are pretty good. We were starving so we ordered a few apps and spicy yellow tail rolls which were all half off and I had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and Hubby had a domestic beer. We were still a little hungry so we got and order of Hory Fook Rolls.  The food was excellent. The crab rangoons had HUGE pieces of crabs in them. Huge chunks and the chili gastrique (what does that even mean?) was yummy. The yellowtail melted in my mouth and the Hory Fook was spicy happiness.   As for service, we were a little hesitant as it took a whilr for us to first be served. But, once our waitress, Crystal, came by she was spot on. She came by at all the right times. Always right when we needed something and not so often that it killed conversation. She was excellent.   All in all our dinner was just under $40 including two drinks each. Nice."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everyone is always so friendly, I love the atmosphere, I always get great service, and the food is amazing!!   My favorite rolls are the Las Vegas, Tootsie, and the buffalo chicken roll. The perfect thing to have after sushi is the green tea ice cream so yummy!"}
{"text":"Great service. Food 4 stars, and reasonably priced. $10-12 for sashimi and house rolls are a couple bucks cheaper than most places. Quality and portions were good. The charred squid app and new style yellowtail sashimi were different, fun and tasty."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice now. Each time has been amazing. The first time I got the Flying Phoenix roll and the second time I got the Ultimate Philly roll. Both were so delicious. We're from Seattle and have heard finding good, fresh sushi is hard to find in Phoenix, so we really lucked out to have found this place so quickly. They have an awesome HH from 3-7. Half priced appetizers, 4-5$ drink specials. We will definitely become regulars here."}
{"text":"Great location, fresh sushi, and super fun modern feel and vibe to the atmosphere. They also make great drinks. It is a fun place to meet or take friends and you can hear each other as it get more more busy. I like that we could carry on a conversation.   It is definitely a recommended spot to anyone wanting fun, fresh, vibrant, and creative sushi choices."}
{"text":"I was there when our tip was turned into $113.  The bill was only $97.58 why would we leave you $113. Now the owner won't even help us out here and is saying his staff would never do this...? Well, looks like they did.  I would warn everyone to check their credit card statements and make sure they are accurate. The food was great! But, totally not worth the head ache of this happening. If you are going to try this place I would advise using cash only. They'll rip you off then deny it. Schuyler, the owner won't reason with you."}
{"text":"Update - About a month and a half ago, a Squid Ink representative, Jo M, contacted me via Yelp to offer an apology and a gift card. She req my e-mail addy as well. She then sent two separate messages to my personal e-mail address over the course of two weeks pretty much saying the same thing and asking for an address both times, which I immediately replied back to each time. Another week passes and she contacted me on Yelp to see if I had received the gift card, which I replied that I had not. I was told that a new GM had taken over so she (the same Squid Ink rep) would personally send it out and check back in. That was nearly a month ago since the last message and nada from Squid Ink. I never once asked or expected compensation so I am not really all that bummed about a silly gift card, but I don't understand what the runaround and lack of follow through was all about."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! Go to Nick at the sushibar for some of the best sushi you'll ever experience. Rebecca and Sara were awesome! Also the kobe burger is a must try! We'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The only reason I have given 2 stars is because the food was enjoyable. We sat down for nearly 10 minutes before being greeted. It was not the bartender who took our order, nor gave us plates and cutlery, nor ran us our food, but the BARBACK. It was more than 30 minutes before the bartender finally spoke a word to us.  Upon asking for a manager, it happens to be that our horrible bartender is the Manager on duty. My boyfriend who was with me, and I, both work in the food and service industry, neither of us would ever leave a customer unspoken to for this long.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"I just had some of the best sushi I've ever had while at this place. Nick was the sushi chef. He made a custom roll and it was to die for. I thank all the staff there for making the whole experience great."}
{"text":"Went here with a good friend on July 3rd Happy Hour.  We sat at the bar.  Bartender was nice and friendly.  Not too many people here on a Monday Holiday Weekend.  We got the BLVD (white fish + king crab - decent), spicy tuna roll (delicious), crab rangoon (very good), edamame (very good), cucumber sunonomo (okay).    We had better sushi at other places but the location is convenient.  We had a good time despite the place being kinda hot (not sure why).  We were both literally sweating the entire time."}
{"text":"I stopped in for what I thought would be a quick lunch while at a conference in Phoenix. After being seated, no wait staff, no menu, no place setting. Another 15 minutes I am informed that the kitchen is backed up, and lunch orders are taking a long time. I place my order and after another 30 minutes, no food, not even a beverage or appetizer. After 45 minutes, I get frustrated and get up to leave. In their defense, as I get up to leave, my food is finally ready and they pack it to go and comp the meal. I accept their concession, but would rather have just had a peaceful lunch in the restaurant, rather than having to tote take out sushi to the conference center."}
{"text":"Excellent starters and sushi . I'm coming back tomorrow morning for bloody Mary's and fresh mimosas. Customer service was good and the patio had a good vibe."}
{"text":"A leisurely lunch spot that still gets you in and out quickly during the lunch hour! In summary, you feel like you've been there enjoying a nice lunch for awhile but in reality, you're in and out before your lunch hour's up! Located right in the heart of Downtown Phoenix at CityScape, this is a perfect spot for lunchtime delight. They offer lunch specials which are very reasonably priced and come with a cup of Miso soup. During a lunch here, I enjoyed the Spicy Tuna lunch special which came with delicious spicy tuna, tempura eggplant, rice and other veggies. It was the perfect combination of filling and flavorful and I gobbled up ever bite! This is a great spot for lunch in Downtown Phoenix and one that I will visit again soon."}
{"text":"Great sushi place. Staff was quick and responsive, chef was cool. We sat at the bar and we got appetizers and they were all delicious, sashimi platter, seared fish, crab rangoons and for dinner we had three rolls, all delicious! Happy hour special was half price appetizers and house special rolls with a discount. Trendy cool place, a little pricey for sushi but I guess you pay for the atmosphere and ambiance. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise! Great service, Tasty cocktails, great little happy hour menu, sushi, potstickers, edamame, sweet potato fries (best ever)...and the beef short ribs... which, I swear was roast beef, but whatever, it was tender and delicious.  We feasted and packed a to go box.  Establishment was clean and upbeat... we sat at the bar... I'll go back anytime!"}
{"text":"Break down of our order:  Happy Hour  -Potstickers -California roll   Non-HH Las Vegas  Bill a little over $30 after tip.  All the rolls were dry and bland.  The vegas roll was the worst one I have had so far.  I was not really suprised with the quality.  I had a feeling that it was going to be lacking, yet I still had to give them a try.  Sadly, the rolls lived up to my expectations.  The service was great.  The ambiance was decent.  I did not drink this time, but I have been here in the past for reverse HH and find drink prices to be reasonable.  I most likely will be back for drinks and potstickers when I want to relax after shopping at the stores nearby. But definitely not for their sushi."}
{"text":"Food is good, not amazing. Potstickers  were yummy! Service needs an overall, never got our waters we asked for, our appetizer came after our entrees, and the hostess came to check on us more than the waitress. Note to management.."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying Squid Ink, particularly because their happy hour food menu is pretty substantial. Was so disappointed... everything was the \"okay\" version of what it could have been. Potstickers were fine, miso cod wasn't seared or served hot enough. Sushi was just very lackluster. Our meal was $72 and felt like it should have been no more than $50 with the quality of the fish."}
{"text":"Love the indoor/outdoor patio bar, gorgeous fresh interior creates a good vibe - bright and full of natural light for lunch and swanky in the evening.  Friendly, prompt staff always willing to take care of you.  Get whatever the daily special is or try the Pepper crusted Filet Mignon on a bed of broccolini in a house made hot mustard sauce, the Miso Cod, or the favorite Kobe Burger.  Happy hour 3p-6p Mon-Sat, 4p-6p Sun, reservations accepted Sun-Thu.  Best bar to hang out at in Cityscape!"}
{"text":"Had date night with the husband, we decided to go to a restaurant downtown once a month. For a few years we said we would go to Squid Ink and we finally did. The place is small and tables are limited, so we sat at the counter. Our waitress was friendly and took our order quickly. The sushi was great! We gobbled it down quickly. The Miso soup was yum, as well as the Japanese fried chicken... We will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"It's pretty good. I would go if a majority rule decides to go here, otherwise I have other places in mind. They do have an amazing ramen however."}
{"text":"Loved this place..especially they have happy hour everyday 3-7... the ambiance  and food was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Surf and Turf Roll - Absolutely fantastic. Asparagus tips inside were such a fun surprise.   Seafood Dynamite is all made with cooked seafood, so while I'm not personally a huge fan - It was okay. They don't clarify that it's cooked on the menu. If they did, I wouldn't have ordered it and they'd have 5 stars.   Nigiri is PHENOMENAL! order nigiri or sashimi here and you won't be disappointed.   Heaters on patio make this a fantastic place to go in the winter."}
{"text":"I come to Phoenix a lot for work. This is one oft favorite places to go. The food is always spot on and drink are always great. Black Cod is a must. Alicea has been my bartender / server all three times. Always very knowledgeable with the food, drinks and always has a smile. Not sure if she is manager but if not she should be. If I had a place of businesses I might have to steel her. She rocks. Sum it up drinks are great food is even better and it's always a fun atmosphere. Great place to start before a game."}
{"text":"After our bad experience the management staff was really great and on point. They contacted us immediately and had us come back in for a way better experience.  Great recovery guys!"}
{"text":"As a foodie moving to the area from Chandler, I had high hopes for this place and was dying to try it as the area seems limited. Trendy look from the inside and out. We headed over for dinner and was sat right away. That was the only bonus. Once sat, the waitress was non-existent. Typically my husband and I rack up a hefty bill after a few drinks and trying different food items. Not this time. Since the waitress never checked in, we didn't order anything more than our first round of food and drinks. When we did see our waitress, it was when she was at other tables. Additionally, management should really set a dress code. Our waitresses shorts were so short that her underwear trim was hanging out. Not very tasteful when your underwear is longer than your shorts. The food was sub par. Time to get the bill. No waitress again. Eventually my husband went and asked the host to find our waitress and have her bring it over. We went to a second restaurant that night just to be able to finish out the night. If in the mood for sushi, we now drive the little bit further for quality. I recommend you do the same."}
{"text":"This place is very trendy, good service and food. We're looking forward to going back to see what the live band nights are like."}
{"text":"Visiting the day after the Super Bowl, needed a quick bite after our bumpy flight from Chicago. Ordered the sashimi platter. Nice big pieces of fish and some thinly sliced octopus. Fresh tasting and delicious.  My daughter had the sushi combo which was 6 pieces of crab roll and various sushi including tasty eel. Very nice presentation. Good wine selection too. Service a bit slow but only 2 servers for about 20 customers so understandable. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Sister and I came here for  drinks. She had the \"deep water\" and I had the \"revolver\". Both were slightly sweet but not over powering and were very tasty. I looked at their happy hour menu and they have great prices so we will be back for that next time!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular here for quite some time as I love the atmosphere and the sushi is excellent! They have excellent happy hour prices so you can keep it reasonable even with adult beverages included. I recently had a friend in from out of town and we spent the afternoon sitting outside enjoying the weather, we shared sashimi, garlic edamame and several different sushi rolls, food was excellent and our server was even better! Thank you to Melissa for making our girlfriend day even better! She was available, accommodating and fun! Just what we needed - we will be back!! I have never had a bad experience here! I have been with my kids, my husband or just out with friends, service and quality are always excellent!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing, food was mediocre like always, never been a fan but thought I'd give it another try... Still a really nice and chill place to eat  I normally don't like to rant on here or say to much negative things unless necessary but when you charge someone $7 for 2 pieces of pork belly that are the size of a dice each you're ripping your customers off. I've been a chef at Japanese restaurants before and when we serve yakitori they get 2 skewers with about 3-4 oz of meat on each and lots of onions and bell pepper, instead of 1 pineapple, for around $10 just saying"}
{"text":"Came to squid ink last weekend with a group of 8. Made a reservation on yelp and when we arrived our table was waiting for us. The set up is indoor/outdoor which makes for a nice atmosphere. Pretty decent menu with options for sushi lovers and non sushi lovers alike! The staff was very friendly. The hostesses always had a smile on their face. Minus one star for getting our sushi order wrong but it was corrected right away! The food and drinks were tasty. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pretty standard sushi joint, but 5 stars for the PLAYLIST! Straight fire. Mos Def, Common, Wu, Gang Starr, Talib.. probably makes the food taste that much better :D"}
{"text":"Great place - awesome music, friendly staff and delicious eats. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is they forgot my appetizer."}
{"text":"Visit this place weekly, so that's definitely a review in itself. Tootsie roll and garlic edamame are absolutely to die for, wonton soup is another favorite. Also love having dessert at this place. Crab wontons, CHICKEN WINGS, and even the water enhanced with lemon and cucumber are all amazing. Definitely would recommend this place again and again."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  In the 6 weeks they have opened I have come almost every week (sometimes 3 times in a week) The salmon rice bowl is to die for. Lots of gluten free options!!! The wings are yummy n stop it with the killer bloody Mary today.  Heaven awaits you! Crystal is great!  Kinda of an angel."}
{"text":"I've been to the branch in Scottsdale 3 times so far, and have never had a bad experience or bad food.  I have recommended this restaurant to everyone I know  And I will in the future. You can see my photos on site that I ate today 10-26-15."}
{"text":"Amy is awesome !!!! We came in randomly , always in the area, always debated to come or not. After tonight and our wonderful experience - well be back! The entire bar staff is friendly, knowledgable about drinks and food, and helpful for us first timers. We got the dumpling miso soup, just for something to have and it's SO good! An upgraded miso soup, best described. Can't believe we over looked this place before. If we hadn't just come from dinner, we would of eaten. Can't wait to come back and really explore the menu. We're big sushi fans and they had a featured sushi tonight - FUN! 5/5 come here when you can!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, feels a bit like a franchise though, nothing to write home about.  Prices are good though esp., during happy hour and the place feels modern and clean. Our waitress was friendly and the food came out quickly. So, if you're in the area and want decent sushi at a reasonably price that won't leave you running to the bathroom, this isn't a bad choice."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is suspect. Location is perfect in the heart of downtown. Been twice and both Times it just seems like the staff is not happy. No smiles slow service and I'm an easy customer. I had to ask twice nicely and flag down our waitress for sugar/sweetener for my iced tea. The most recent visit they sat us down at a dirty table and served us a cold las Vegas roll which is normally cooked and warm. Dissapointed with the second experience as the place has a great set up with a cool vibe. I'm sure we will be back but talk is there is another sushi place downtown that's all about giving you a great experience and great food period. Try the ultimate Philly roll and the surf n turf."}
{"text":"This place is very good overall I love everything about it even the amazing pb and j rolls! Great service as well, keep it up!"}
{"text":"I've been to a decent amount of sushi bars around town and I wasn't very impressed by here. I've heard nothing but good things from friends about this place and finally went this weekend for a friend's birthday party.   The atmosphere is fine, loud music on a Saturday night wasn't a big deal and the crowd was good. They had a DJ and a little bit of dancing for some of the songs but nothing crazy or annoying. I really don't care about decor, I go to restaurants for the food.   I ordered the Vegas roll since someone wanted to split it and its normally a fairly tasty roll. It was such a small roll I ended up ordering appetizers since I split the roll. For $11 the Vegas roll was very small in diameter with small pieces of fish inside and only came with 5 pieces! I wasn't too thrilled about that considering I can get a lot bigger roll with bigger pieces of fish inside at Tokyo Lobby. The appetizers were fair... I ordered the Crab Rangoons and the Pork Gyoza. For Happy Hour the appetizers are a good deal because they each come with a decent amount on the plate. The Crab rangoons had pretty good sized pieces of crab inside which is a nice change but 2 of them had nothing in them, no crab or cream cheese. Overall i'd like to give this place another shot and i'll review again but the first experience as far as food was sub-par."}
{"text":"I seriously question whether the people who gave this place 5 stars have ever eaten sushi in their lives. This place is so bad, I would rather eat sushi from the grocery store. Rolls are full of imitation crab and who knows what other fish they're trying to pass off as sushi quality. There were shells in our rolls as well."}
{"text":"Don't come super hungry or expecting authentic sushi.  I will however still support it as it is in CityScape and we need another sushi place (the other ones are Moira, which is meh and Pallet which can be hit or miss).  The rolls are inventive but only okay.  A better bet for lunch is a curry or a noodle dish.  The good news is that their HH pricing is more than generous.  The restaurant is super pretty and I'm happy to say that service is friendly.  But for authentic, I'd try Teeter House or Hana first.  In a pinch and downtown, come to Squid Ink because we want to see a vibrant downtown and you need a couple of sushi houses for that."}
{"text":"It's a little on the pricey side for a west side sushi place, especially considering the place across the street which is much less expensive.  But, the sushi here is better.  It never has that fishy smell that some sushi places have.  The bar tenders and sushi chefs are really nice and chat you up a bit.  The servers are all pretty but could be a little more chatty or attentive.  Not a fan of the live music they have there sometimes, it's a bit loud and annoying when you just wanna eat but it doesn't stop me from going there.    Most importantly, it's a sushi place, and the sushi is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"I just had lunch here and thoroughly enjoyed it. The house rolls are creative and they have good lunch specials. The atmosphere is great and the bar looked well-stocked, especially for a sushi place. If you like sushi, you should check this place out!"}
{"text":"We were so excited when we saw the sign for this place, and stopped by today for lunch, a Friday afternoon.  We were told it was the grand opening.  Overall, it was hit and miss.  The decor is very nice - modern, clean.  Service is friendly, but inconsistent.  We ordered two appetizers but only ever received one.  The kids meals came out early, but one was incorrect (rice instead of noodles).  Then it was quite a long time (like 20 minutes) before we had any other food arrive.  Sushi was beautifully presented - especially the cougar roll, which was excellent - but the rolls were a bit loose and the tuna had a slight metallic aftertaste, and everything was a tad warm.  Also, portions were small for the price.  We may give them another try, to see if the opening day jitters settle, but we were hoping for more.  If you want good sushi and great service, try Tokyo Lobby or Fresh Wasabi."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - B.O.B ft. Bruno Mars - Nothing On You)  Squid Ink Sushi, in downtown Phoenix I could be tasting, and my time is precious They got nothin on you, baby Nothin on you, baby  They might say Bo, and I might say Bites But you shouldn't worry, about what I'm saying Cause they got nothin on you, baby Nothin on you, baby  Literally the center of downtown Phoenix lies a sushi restaurant.  Yep, a sushi restaurant in the middle of a desert!  Hot as it may be; maybe it's heating up because of this place - wink!  Let us explore and enjoy!  My friend from Philly was in town and Bo Biting we went!  Ordered our drinks and went for the kill!  We started with some Agedashi Tofu; it was breaded with Panko and layed on a bed of smoky mirin soy sauce; overall a good start.  Next we went for it; spicy salmon roll, salmon roe, Pokemon roll, Flying Phoenix roll, and the Pan Seared Butterfish to top it off!  I didn't try the salmon roe since I usually don't care for it.  The first thing I notice and so did my partner was the rice was pretty darn good and well cooked. My favorite of the bunch was definitely the Pokemon roll; what seems to be a California roll topped with jalapeno, grilled onion and a grapefruit.  Second in line was the Flying Phoenix; crab roll topped with seared ahi, shrimp, and black pepper sauce drizzled all around.  We finished our entree with the butterfish which was beautifully plated.  It was served with grilled asparagus and fried onions and a very unique sauce; strawberry miso!  We finished the night was dessert of course and we went for the rice pudding brulee - OMG!  What a dessert; sticky rice, coconut milk, vanilla bean within a brown crusted sugar!  Where have you been in my short life!    Overall, a great experience!  Service was attentive and well trained while the place was very modern and sleek.  In the end, I must recommend a try! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I would mark this a five star review . The manager is great and has really good customer service skill, he is very pleasant to talk to you.  The food is outstanding and very delicious. My only complaint is the bartender Nathan, he was very impolite and he made me not enjoy my meal at this beautiful restaurant. I usually come very often and I'm always satisfied. Especially the management they are so great and always come by to check on how I'm doing and anything I might need . I believe the bartending is a job that requires exceptional customer service skills along with a friendly welcoming attitude. I hope management gets opportunity to read  this review because things like that make people either want to come back or not. Thank you . I highly recommend this restaurant just maybe ask for a table if your wanting a smiley face around."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  My co-worker and I arrived at Squid Ink just minutes after happy hour ended, yet the waitress was nice enough to let us still take advantage of the happy hour specials (maybe pulling the 'out of town, here for business' card worked?).  We both ordered mixed drinks, and both were very tasty!  We sat outside, which was nice with the misters on the patio.  They made me forget that I was sitting outside in the Arizona heat!  Sushi was probably some of the better sushi I've had.  My only slight dislike was the green tea ice cream I ordered for dessert.  Don't get me wrong - it was delicious.  However, the serving size was HUGE.  It just didn't quite match up with the smaller servings typically associated with a sushi place.  I could've easily split my dessert with a table of 4-5 and still have generous portions.  Overall, I would recommend this place and go back.  Great service."}
{"text":"I got the Beef Yakisoba and a side of Tokyo Frites to go the other day for lunch. I wasn't crazy about it. I'm still developing a more sophisticated palate for Asian food but the overall flavor in this dish didn't wow me. And it should have: soba noodles with filet, brocollini, mushrooms and carrots. A lot of my favorite stuff and a pretty balanced meal, but just not that tasty.  The filet itself was VERY nicely prepared and tasty but the overall blandness of everything else overpowered what was should have been the star of this show. I'm sure there's something else on the menu that properly complements it so I'm definitely coming back to try more stuff.  4 stars for the awesome set up they have. Their sushi bar is to the left as you enter, to the right is the bar and seating area. Despite my lack of enthusiasm for my first meal, I have MUCH enthusiasm for the bar and for the bartender who was really nice. I can't wait 'til the weather cools down and they open up the bar on the street (and they take down that damn scaffolding)  They play good music in here and the atmosphere is good. I'm sure they have some small plates that will go with the alcohol that I am looking forward to consuming at Happy Hour.  This is a neat place at Cityscape definitely worth checking out....if for nothing else, the bar!"}
{"text":"It was 8 of us celebrating Renee's 15th year with UHC.  I had Octopus  it was so good that I could describe to you exactly how it felt when I put it in my mouth but I don't want to take too much of your time. I can't wait to come back to Squid Ink and explore.  Cute server."}
{"text":"Midnight. Joint closes at 2AM. Fantastic. Only thing sushi isn't served after midnight. Why in God's name would you stop serving the one thing you specialize in?  Stoopid. Note to owner:  Could you have chosen a more unappealing name for your restaurant. Squid Ink?  Ruck!  And for all of the above issues it's easy to see why your Scottsdale location closed."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here during happy hour and we were very impressed. I just got a water but it was the best water because it had lemon and cucumber in it! Yummy! Usually with happy hour sushi you get 4-6 pieces per roll...not here...you get 8-9 pieces per roll! We did not realize that and ordered WAY to much sushi (4 rolls) and could not finish it all. My husband had a Sake bomb...and he said it was ok..but the beer was weak and watered down. We ordered carb rangoon, the four rolls, and the sake bomb and our total was well under $30. If we are in the area during happy hour, we will return for sure."}
{"text":"This is my favorite new sushi place.  They have a great indoor/outdoor bar area.  Their craft beer selection is above average.  I like the garlic edemame and the grilled squid appetizers.  The rolls and nigiri are all solid as well.  Make sure you get there for happy hour to enjoy the best prices!"}
{"text":"We came here for drinks only- very attentive staff, and a very fun atmosphere! It has a great outdoor/indoor area with a very chic vibe.  My fiancé got the Shiso Happens and loved it! I was told it was very refreshing. The presentation was also lovely. People watching is also a plus!"}
{"text":"Usually doing PR and other political/business stuff downtown so I'm here often.   While I usually peruse through the menu and skip straight to the alcohol, I've never been disappointed with the food here and neither have my clients. From catchy names like the Hory Fook which, is delicious by the way to usual sushi menu items like their sashimi, I can definitely say that it's worth eating here besides drinking here.   Service is good usually. When things speed up on busier nights expect a little bit of a wait for alcohol if you're at the bar. Pricing is what you'd expect for a downtown sushi joint. Parking is a little bit of a difficulty but I always use valet. Modern look and some cool murals give it a trendy/classy vibe which is usually reflected in the people that come here, ha ha. All in all, always a good experience."}
{"text":"My friends and I wanted to try a new place so we decided  to try it here. First of all our waiter took forever to greet us and did not pay any attention to us. My friend ordered soup and it was never brought out yet he still charged it on our bill. He has not come once to ask us how we are doing and several other tables got their food before us when we sat down and ordered 20 minutes before them. Not impressed"}
{"text":"Great sushi, best I've had so far in my time here in Tempe from the moment we moved here it has been my boyfriend and I's go to spot. I love love the decor and the squid theme and the food is wonderful. We've been to the Scottsdale one and this one and service is great at both places. Their pot stickers are to die for and I love their roasted garlic edamame"}
{"text":"I've been to the cityscape location, love the atmosphere there! But now that the new Shea location is finally open I'm thrilled! My boyfriend and I went in tonight, kind of slow at first , but with the rain, superbowl and just being the 2nd day they've opened, the pace picked up, surprisingly! I ordered the Tsunami roll and the Revolver to drink, my boyfriend ordered the Dirty Rockstar and their Yuzu Lemonade. The kiwi vinaigrette complimented the tsunami roll amazingly, the Revolver was delicious as well, tasted like a fruity Moscow mule, like my server described.. My boyfriend loved how spicy the habanero and jalapenos were on the dirty rockstar, and how fresh the yuzu lemonade was! Service was great as well, super friendly and knowledgeable, we will definitely be coming back regularly!"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Xcellant waitress Danielle. One of my favorite places to eat. If you are looking for a comfortable and hip place to enjoy the Arizona weather and great food and their unique presentation this is the place to come"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet- I came with a friend for HH one night and liked the vibe, food and service. The sushi rolls here are above average and I liked the variety. The surf and turf roll was really delicious and I would recommend it. The prices here were pretty high so be prepared."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Great sushi, great drinks. Never disappoints! Hostess, waitress, and bartenders are extremely nice and friendly. Makes for a very enjoyable dinner :)"}
{"text":"Another late review by me. :o(  However, we thought this place was great! Met co-workers for happy hour before I moved out of state. Our server was very informative and made our stay enjoyable. Let' see if I can remember what we had . . . .  The grilled calamari was heavenly. I did not expect it to be that good. The green bean tempura was perfect. The black miso cod was also tasty (although the best I ever had was at ShinBay). Wanted to scarf down the entire bowl of roasted garlic edamame. Forgot which house rolls we ordered, though. With the help of our server we made two selections - I want to say the dirty rockstar and flying phoenix, but not sure - and they were awesome.  We sat on the patio and enjoyed the people watching that day. The decor is nice and I hope this place sticks around so I can come back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"For Phoenix this is pretty solid sushi however they are very hit or miss. At times the rolls are spot on with perfectly prepared sashimi and at other times I wonder if the JV staff is working"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place!! I worked at a sushi restaurant for 4 years so I'm EXTREMELY hard to please when it comes to sushi, but this is my lunch break go-to. Their sushi rolls are amazing and the chefs and staff are always friendly and very helpful. You MUST try their Pokémon roll, it's to die for, and their lunch specials are great quality and very affordable. A must-try in Peoria!"}
{"text":"Visited for lunch with a girlfriend. Two stars for friendly wait staff and fresh modern decor, but not a fan of the over priced, subpar sushi: my salmon nigiri tasted both fishy and as though it were left exposed overnight in a refrigerator, and the rice supporting it was falling apart before my chopsticks even touched it. With so many superior sushi options in the vicinity, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Arrived at 2:05 on a Saturday and was told lunch was done and only serving dinner. Ordered the 20 piece dinner sashimi. The salmon was delicious, the octopus was super salty and overly chewy, and the tuna was too thin, brown and veiny and the other fish had scales. Yuck. Never again! Oh and service was awful."}
{"text":"Wish we could have had the same experience as Pamela M. but not so.... it was 6:30 on a Monday, place was busy... good sign....waited 10 min for a table... was seated and waited another 15 minutes with no service...waitresses all over the place and not one notice that we were there..... we must have been invisible."}
{"text":"Look at my profile and you'll see that I don't write many reviews that are less than 3 stars.  I'm a positive person and pride myself on making wise dining decisions due to using Yelp to research most places before I go.  Squid Ink was no exception.  When they opened, I was pleased to see a new sushi option conveniently located at Shea and Scottsdale, and the positive reviews followed...  I finally had the opportunity to dine at this Squid Ink location last night with three girlfriends and I was extremely underwhelmed.  How did the Yelp community let me down?  I had a completely different experience than the positive reviews written previously.  The staff was not friendly, nor did they seem knowledgeable about their menu.  Our waitress seemed to be in her own world, and the support she had with keeping water glasses filled, checking on us, etc... was pretty non-existent. Still, we were in good company and had higher hopes for the food.  We ordered a bottle of wine for the table (half off on Tuesdays, which was a great incentive to go the bottle route) and a variety of items ranging from garlic edamame, seaweed and Thai Beef salad to some standard maki, sashimi, and a couple of their signature rolls as well.    When our wine arrived, our waitress placed it on our table without pouring any of us glasses.  Weird, right?  The food was edible, but none of it tasted particularly fresh.  The cuts of fish were difficult to chew... the spice and dressings were off as well.  The items came out at different times and were basically thrown on the table at us without much explanation.  Upon waiting for my final roll to arrive (the BLVD), a roll that resembled nothing like the description was placed in front of me and the guy that delivered it said \"last up... the Blvd.\"  When I flagged someone else down to confirm, they confirmed my hunch - it was definitely not the Blvd roll.  The correct roll came shortly after.  We made the most of our experience and had fun due to the company, but none of us will be back again... I had high hopes but was disappointed by Squid Ink.  If you find yourself here, perhaps try the cooked food; I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that it has to be better than the sushi."}
{"text":"I came on a Sat night, was nice to see happy hour on from 10 to midnight.  Bar was decently busy, had a guy playing guitar on patio, had a nice vibe.  I sat @ bar, ordered the wings and shrimp tempura roll.  Bartender was very attentive and filled my water like 4 times, which I appreciated.  Food seemed to take about a little longer than normal, but im just an idiot for not getting some garlic edamame for $2 first.  So the wings here are amazing!  Love the grill/char flavor, and the spices from whatever they cook those wings in stay on your lips for a few minutes after you eat them.  Extremely flavorful bites.  Used the tangy ranch sauce with every bite too.  I would give these wings 5 outta 5 stars, and for only $4 for 10, its easily my new favorite place for wings.  At a sushi bar too, go figure.  And oh yeah, the shrimp tempura roll was good.  But did I mention the wings here are awesome?"}
{"text":"I can't get excited about this place.  Tried it twice, and both times we just left with a \"meh\" feeling about it.  First off, pricing is kind of high, seems like 10-15% more than other nearby sushi joints.  That would be OK if the quality was exceptional, but it's not.  It's pretty average all around, and just across the street there's a place that beats it and doesn't have the price premium.  We won't be back.  Not because it was bad, but just not great, and too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, and yum! Love that even with Comic Con going on they had happy hour! I had my usual Sake Bomb, good, a Vegas Roll, good, a spicy tuna roll, delicious, and then we tried the Khaleesi, a con special! OMG delicious! One of the best rolls I have had. It had a $17 price tag, so I am glad it was good. We were celebrating, and it was so worth it! I also tried the Buffalo Chicken Roll, not my cup of tea, but my husband devoured it. He said it was his favorite after the Khaleesi.  I also tasted a soy paper one with crab (sorry forgot the name) it was very good as well. I will say we tried three mixed drinks and they were all a bit too sweet for me, maybe add a more sour or savory mixed drink to the menu, but I will honestly always grab a sake bomb with my sushi and unless something else gets highly recommended."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings. The garlic edemame was excellent. After that it was all down hill for me. Ordered 2 sushi rolls.....who does sushi without rice or nori? Had to actually order a separate bowl of rice!  Being from Hawaii, and a big sushi fan, definitely not for me. Service was so-so"}
{"text":"I like this place. I like it even more when its happy hour and they have happy hour pricing! Lots of fun rolls to choose from. Nice open patio and bar for when the weather starts to cool off. It can get really busy at happy hour. For my picky child, they do plain ramen noodles -- so that was great. i have never had a bad thing here. Its a fun atmosphere in an area that is pretty cookie cutter."}
{"text":"We love this place. Great atmosphere, fun drink menu and great sushi! Happy hour is also a great time to check out Squid Ink! It is a little busy but we have always been taken care of!"}
{"text":"For the price of some of these special rolls and the quantity I don't feel It's worth it. It did not help that the person helping me did not know how to work any register and even know I called ahead I waited forever, past the allotted time they gave me. Definitely a work in progress."}
{"text":"Ordered the surf and turf roll, tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll, pot stickers, and coconut curry chicken. First, the ambience is meant to look trendy. All of the female staff wear very tight fitting clothes. The happy hour prices are a good deal, however are only good if you dine in. Extra $$ was added to our bill for our food being take out during happy hour. Nothing feels better than getting nickel and dimed, SMH. The curry tasted like it was made with mayo. The surf and turf was drenched in mayo. The tuna roll was ok. The potstickers were ok. The shrimp tempura roll was good.  If your looking for a place that is trying to be the cool hangout, which means your surrounded by people who are trying very hard to be cool, then this is your place. If you want good sushi i would suggest doraku across the street."}
{"text":"I tried this place, after hearing about it a few times. The food is good. Sushi was fresh, nothing crazy amazing, but standard and very tasty. The Crab Rangoon was delicioso, as was the Hawaiian Bread Pudding. Service was excellent, very attentive and friendly staff, not completely full of shit. Only complaint was I had to send my coca cola back 4 times because it either had no carbonation or no syrup. It was weird, but I can definitely overlook it. They are definitely worth checking out if you heart sushi as much as I do."}
{"text":"Ok, it's about time that I write a review about Squid Ink. After countless visits and probably thousand of dollars spent at this establishment, it's time...  I have frequented Squid Ink since it opened at the Palomar Hotel/City Scape complex. I have, unfortunately, experienced a slow downward spiral for this restaurant in quality of food, preparation of fish and service.  If I had written this 3 years ago, I would have provided a much higher score, but that's irrelevant.  Food: The sushi quality and roll choices are just OK. Nothing too creative nor palate pleasing. I've had just about every roll on the menu and none are keepers. Sashimi is decent grade but many times dry, tasteless or overly fishy tasting.   Service: Warning: if you are seated at the bar, expect to be patient as the wait to get water, drinks and food is excessive. Typically ONE bartender is servicing the entire restaurant and wait staff as well as hostessing and tending to the bar patrons. It just plain sucks if you're at the bar. It didn't help the matter that I got \"chair bombed\" not once, but twice by two separate patrons who felt the need to sit directly next to me when there were other seats open at the bar. Weird!!!  I'm sad to see this place slide downhill. And now that the food has been consistently mediocre and overpriced, I simply have to find another go-to sushi place. Not an easy task downtown."}
{"text":"Nonexistent service. They didn't even come to our table for our drink order within 15 minutes of sitting us down. My girlfriend had locked eyes with several employees and they ignored her clear plea for service. We eventually got up and left. Will never return"}
{"text":"At the bar with the Bartender Amy was one of the best experienced at the downtown/city scape area. The happy hour and sushi selection was all top shelf.  Definitely ask for the spicy mayo and sirachia if you want the rolls with a little extra spice"}
{"text":"Loved our server, food and drinks are great. Great spot for happy hour or lunch on the patio."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!  The cocktails are spectacular! We had the Grapefruit Basil and Heavy Muddle!! Yum!!!  The Garlic Edaname, Miso Soup and Dirty Rockstar were so delicious!!  I look forward to our next visit!  PS when you come to Squid Ink,  ask for Dan, he is an awesome server!"}
{"text":"Update on Squid Ink. I have not been here for several months because they raised their prices substantially. I came today and it is Happy Hour Sunday and it appears that their drink prices at back in line....I think and here is what I'm paying for Cali Roll $5 and $6 for a Philly Roll...so \"meh\" still not really what I would think are \"Happy Hour\" prices. I used to live in Scottsdale for like 30 years...really, and these so called Happy Hour prices resemble theirs."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend & I were visiting AZ from Cali, we went to Squid Ink Sushi Bar and we had the most awesome experience! The food is fabulous, there unique rolls & appetizers kick butt! I wish here in Cali Sushi places would take the extra time to make a simple edamame  a delicious treat like at Squid Ink where they add a bit of Olive oil & garlic and it taste 1000% better! Also there fresh Salmon is just EXQUISITE, there Special Drinks are to die for! Definitely will be going back for more next time we visit, also great customer service, I give Squid Ink 5 ***** :)"}
{"text":"The place and the environment is ok for my tastes, quiet where you can have a conversation.  But food and drinks could really do better. Ordered whisky on the rocks and they brought me a glass of water with ice and some whisky in it :(  Nothing about the food seemed fresh and appealing, miso soup with mushrooms didn't work for me and the seasoning was like bland, sushi didn't seem fresh, edamame either."}
{"text":"The service here is horrendous... I come here 4 days a week for happy hour and my friend likes it so we wanted to do his birthday here. Tried to reserve a table Friday for his birthday and they told me they didn't take reservations on the weekends so to come 30 minutes early. Walk up to the hostess 30 minutes before the birthday party like she said and ask for the big party table I wanted... she tells me there is a reservation for that table... they put us outside in the cold wind. This restaurant has terrible service for how bad their raw fish is... do not recommend for anyone"}
{"text":"Visited the new location at Shea. Mikaela was our server. Her service was outstanding! Great personality and fun! This is our new happy hour spot!"}
{"text":"Did someone say sushi?!  Oh wait, that's my daily craving!  It was New Year Day and guess what I wanted to have for dinner to ring in the Mew Year?  you guessed it, sushi!  Originally, I was going to go to another sushi joint which I will not name here cause I don't want to start a sushi rivalry but the other joint was closed on New Year Day.   As it turns out, it was a blessing in disguise since Squid Ink is located right next to the ice skating rink so we were able to have dinner then walk right over to go skating- so convenient!  We had quite a feast.  Chicken teriyaki bowl for my son, chicken teriyaki noodle for his friend, edamame, shisito peppers, 3 California rolls, 1 spicy Salmon roll, miso cod.  Oh, did you think the rolls were for me?    Of course not!  My growing boy ate his chicken teriyaki bowl then proceeded to eat the California rolls and the spicy salmon roll. After some gentle reminders, I did get a few pieces from each of the different rolls.   It's a good thing when my son heartily eats (since for a young'n, he has a pretty good palate) and we are fighting,hmm I mean sharing happily our sushi!  Michele M. who also joined us for dinner ordered gyoza, fried tofu, California roll, fried shrimp tempura roll also enjoyed her selections.   My fav out of them all was the miso cod. 4 thin slices, perfectly cooked so the cod was still tender and moist. Hmmm, just thinking about it makes me what to have it again.  Service is amicable. Staff friendly. Glad to have come here- and will come again!"}
{"text":"My friends loved this place. The waitress was really cool and on point but I personally thought the sushi was okay. The place is nice! I'll be back but to try something other than sushi. Has good happy hour deals everything else seems a little over priced."}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to give this place a 4-star, but I feel it just barely missed the mark. I loved the atmosphere and the patio. However, our only server on the patio was the bartender, who was very busy. So we waited a while for things like water refills. There is no way for her to access the patio without walking all the way around the other side through the restaurant. Not bad if you are sitting at the bar, but not so good if you are sitting at one of the tables. You guys should really split the bar open for access to the patio.   The food was not bad. I got the ramen. I've been to some really good ramen places, and this was just ok. Not the best I've had. My fiancée liked her sushi. The tempura beans were good, but some on the greasy side.   I honestly would give this place another go if some friends wanted to go there, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back.   Great concept, just needs some polishing."}
{"text":"Omg we had the best happy hour ever!! Emma was so great. Sushi was very good and the vibe was awesome. Miso cod all the way!! Hory Fook!! Roll was so good and ultimatel Philly roll was great."}
{"text":"I was in the downtown area and decided to go in to squid ink yesterday as it was national sushi day. Went in for their happy hour which is daily from 3:00pm-7:00pm. I was not impressed with the happy hour items they don't have a great selection and the prices on the happy hour menu are still pretty high. I ordered the Vegas roll and the rainbow roll $10 each. They were both tasty and enjoyable. The service was okay only two other tables in at the time we went. I am unsure if I will be returning or heading over to Hana or Nori next time I am in the mood for sushi. Overall it's a nice place downtown to hang out, very modern decor and nice colors. Just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Second favorite sushi place but #1 for Happy Hour and patio dining.  Great prices and tasty options though their Happy Hour menu has been reduced.    Nice place to stop by if you are in the area.  Recommend lunch or Happy Hour, dinner is noisy and busy."}
{"text":"The sushi here is just \"eh.\" The restaurant is in a convenient location if you're downtown at CityScape but there are definitely much better places to get sushi in the valley. The service was also extremely slow. Overall I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. My waitress Taylor provided the ultimate experience. Her knowledge of the menu and great personality made it easy to make great selections. I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience at Squid Ink, can't wait to come back to see them again."}
{"text":"There are not many restaurant choices in this area so Squid Ink satisfies that sushi craving! I order carry-out more often than dining in and service is usually quick and food is decent. Happy hour is very good as long as you prefer the less creative rolls. I recommend it but it is a little pricey for the quality."}
{"text":"Atmosphere great for relaxing with friends , date or for me unwinding. Chef Juan is meticulous and on point.  The person taking my order asked great questions so I get what I want. Everything made this a great meal and experience."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite places for happy hour. We almost always get the roasted garlic edamame and the chicken wings (I know...chicken wings at a sushi place seems wrong).   They have great drink specials and pretty much everything we've tried has been great."}
{"text":"Yummy sushi and the location is super cute. Go when the weather is nice and they open the place up. Loved it."}
{"text":"Swanky sushi spot, me likes!  I love the location of this place, right on the corner with the garage attached for easy parking options.  They have some great outdoor seating available as well as nice indoor tables, booths and the sushi bar or bar, bar which leads both indoor and outdoor.  The drink selection is pretty substantial with all of your favorites, including beer, wine (respectable selection including a wonderfully rich Malbec), specialty cocktails and a fully stocked bar.  The sushi menu is good for special rolls.  I was, however, a little disappointed with their veggie options, particularly no shitake mushrooms.  Bummer.  They do, however, have a pretty tasty spicy veggie udon bowl.  All in all, I like this spot."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks huge from outside the doors but when you walk in, it's small. I was at the bar trying to order a drink and had to be standing there for 10 mins and giving her eye contact the whole time. She had to known I was waiting patiently for her to ask me what I would like to drink but she didn't. She continued to ask all the men at the bar how they were and if they needed anything. Then she approached me finally and asked. As I was dining there I ordered the chicken wings. They were okay and baked. I had sushi too and it was my first time trying it. I liked it!"}
{"text":"We were there last night. It was excellent. Very casual. Huge patio. Wonderful servers.  For 90.00 we had 8 drinks, seven huge appetizers and 2 huge sushi rolls.  A ton of food, all great. I highly recommend happy hour. It's over at 7 pm. All the appetizers are 5.00 and many of the excellent cocktails are too.  The service is very good.  I have one odd small complaint.  It had rained earlier.   The servers had to wipe down the whole patio.....the issue.? They left a dirty red bucket sitting out by the doorway with a rag hanging off the corner."}
{"text":"I went in on a Friday evening with a group of 4 including me. After an average 30 minute wait, we were seated inside at a table near the sushi bar. Our waitress was great, refilled our water and asked us how things were plenty. Going there primarily for the sushi, we were disappointed when our sushi was served warm( Philly Roll, California Roll, and a Spicy Tuna Roll) which definitely shouldn't have been warm.. It surely was not fresh. Being that Peoria has limited sushi places, I guess they give themselves the right to have low standards."}
{"text":"Very good. Not as good as Hiro, which is by far the best in Arizona.  The place is really nice, beautiful outdoor seating. The waitress was very sweet. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here before a concert because we wanted sushi and it was close to the arena.  We put our name in and it was a 45 minute wait so we left and returned.  It's definitely crazy when packed and there wasn't a lot of flow to the process.  You kind of just stand in the middle of everything if you want to wait inside or you cook your face off outside.   Our table was unfortunately in the 180 degree sun but it was the only one open and it lasted only 15 minutes.  It took several minutes to be helped but the server was really nice.  I had two glasses of Pinot Grigio and my wife had 2 Tito's and Soda drinks.    The Happy Hour had some good options so we ordered off that menu and off the regular menu as well.  We ordered the Vegas Roll, The Pokemon Roll and the Flying Phoenix Roll.  They were not bad but nothing I would say wowed us.  The potstickers we ordered were good and we also got the shrimp tempura.    I would say it was a good experience but it could be better.  We would probably try it again to compare it but for $150 including tip, expectations were a bit higher.  Again, not a bad experience and we may try it next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Flew into Phoenix around 930, staying downtown. By the time i got checked in everything had stopped serving at the hotel bars and restaurants, but this place was next door and still open.  I was a little skeptical of a sushi joint open at 10 with only one other person there who sent back her ahi poke because she didn't realize it was raw fish. At a sushi place the raw fish surprised her. Nonetheless I didn't feel like wandering so I went in.   Had the yakisoba and the green bean tempura. The tempura was lightly battered and the green beans were fresh and crispy. The yakisoba noodles were cooked well. The steak on top was bland, mostly because the sauce was in the noodles. Taking the effort to mix everything together in proper ratios it was quite pleasant, at first.  The spicy teriyaki is good but it becomes a bit much towards the end of the plate.   I threw in some pieces of sashimi (Salmon and tuna) and a yellowtail nigiri. These were nothing special. Nothing wrong with them but nothing good either.   The place has a nice decor but seems very quiet despite the vibrant happening vibe they are trying to project."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here after a play. I ordered the noodle bowl and hubby ordered a few different rolls. Excellent place with great Asian dishes. I had a raspberry beer that was fantastic. The device was great. Our waitress was phenomenal. We'll definitely be back. So much on the menu that I want to try! I LOVE authentic Asian food and my ramen made me feel like I was back in Korea."}
{"text":"Nice day out today so we decided to sit on the outside at the sushi bar , the community roundtable looked cool to sit at but our party wasnt big enough  Even though this has nothing to do w my review the bathroom stalls are pretty freakin cool I totally take a chick in there w me and get busy  lol  I ordered Firebreathing salmon roll freakin delicious Tuna overkill was ok Seafood dynamite the best"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this location a little more than the Peoria one. The sushi is pretty tasty. Service was ok. Temperature in the restaurant was way too hot for Arizona! I'd give it another shot though!"}
{"text":"Sushi in Arizona that tastes like real fish. Not that I would know, but it seems pretty authentic, and I've certainly had my fair share of raw baddies.  Squid Ink seems really hip and the young wait staff might enforce that opinion, but I haven't felt more comfortable watching college football in a restaurant that didn't have pitchforks on the walls in a long time.   The seating arrangements are a little goofy, but doable. Like most sushi places if you're a group of two, you should sit at the bar.   The prices are certainly reasonable (some might say you're almost stealing it, considering the abysmal quality of many sushi joints here, which pop up like Subways or McDonalds now.) for what you get.   They also have fresh ground wasabi available, which is a continued rarity. Good stuff. Go for the happy hour, stay because you got drunk and need more salmon."}
{"text":"Ahh.... Squid Ink, your ramen is just SO good. I order it to go as often as I can. The pork belly ramen is my favorite.  And the egg is always cooked perfectly.   Reasons you should try squid ink: - decor is super cool, trendy, & interesting - sushi is delicious - drinks are great - great service - indoor and outdoor seating is available  HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! Everyone but our waitress checked on us. She tried to cash us out before we got our food. A nice man named Juan gave us his card on the way out so we can come back. Unbeliever we waited over an hour for our food which I think was never even ordered. Never going back."}
{"text":"Highly recommend for good sushi and an excellent place to bring your pooch. We went to Squid Ink on a Saturday afternoon and had an awesome experience. We brought our dog so we sat in the patio section and the servers could not have treated us better. The food was great and they even brought out a snack for our pooch."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm not hip enough. Vey trendy for the burbs andlooks like a popular place.  Indoor and outdoor bar, large patio etc.  Sushi was good but probably not gonna be a regular. Just wasn't feeling it. Great location and easy to find. Try it. It may be your new fav."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is good. But the music is sooooooo loud you have to scream to the person across the table from you. Um, hello...have you ever heard of background music? This isn't a night club."}
{"text":"A large group (10 people) and I decided to check this place out during the middle of the downtown lunch rush hour. Despite the large group, the service was quick and the food came out relatively quickly. I ordered the lunch sushi platter which came with Miso Soup, a roll and about 4 pieces of Nigiri. For the amount of sushi given and blandness of the Nigiri, the $11 price point was not bad. Be sure to add fresh Wasabi to your order to supplement your sushi!"}
{"text":"So I'm from California and I LOVE SUSHI!!!! So when I found a sushi spot that was open this late I had to try it out. I work late so this is a perfect night spot for me.  The service was on point. I sat at the bar and each bartender was very helpful. The service was quick... However that late at night it would of been strange if it wasn't when there weren't a lot of people there.  They have a decent draft selection. The sushi rolls were good. Nothing really crazy, but they tasted on point and your servers decent amount. The best roll I tried was the dragon roll and the calamari!  I have yet to try the place out on a Saturday night but for my needs its a cool choice! GOOOO SUSHI!!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in with one of my girlfriends for lunch and thought this place was pretty amazing. It has a great atmosphere with the indoor/outdoor patio bar area.   We started with the tempura beans and crab rangoon which were both really good, and a couple of cocktails. The sushi took quite a while to come out but it was well worth the wait. It was nice and fresh and prepared beautifully. I ordered the surf and turf which was delicious, the sauce was amazing! I also got the cougar which was also really good but not as great as the surf and turf.  The only downside to this visit was the waiter. We had to flag him down several times for drink refills. Since the wait was so long, he should have checked in a little more with us.  All in all I will definitely return and would love to partake in the patio next time. The food and drinks were really good and it's conveniently located."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi in town. Love coming here! Such a great atmosphere and staff is awesome."}
{"text":"I was super excited to find this place nestled in downtown Phoenix.  Their specialty cocktails are superb. Had the squid for an appetizer and it was slightly overcooked but was packed with flavor.  The sushi was good quality and was as smooth as butter.  My primary complaint: way too much spice. Ordered three rolls and the lobster, I'm glad I ate the lobster first because I couldn't taste much after bites of the others. The partner and I ended up only have one to two pieces of each because of the heat overload.  Service was fantastic and the sushi chefs really know their stuff."}
{"text":"Sushi is just ok. The portions are of average size.  Price is probably above average - five people ate and drank about $300 late at night.   The ramen is horrible. If you walked into Walmart, bought the 5 for $1 packs of ramen, and made it yourself, you would have a better product.  The experience just reinforces my rule to avoid any \"fusion\" restaurants for sushi."}
{"text":"Overpriced .. no real crab.. just \"crab meat\" the ramen was delicious. The bread pudding dessert was a must have, def top three on best bread pudding I've had. The bathrooms are unisex. How awesome is that! The huge mirrors are perfect for selfie taking. Seating fills up quick leaving only the sushi bar open. Still upset about the fake crab ... my only ehhh.. don't charge 15$ for sushi when it has fake crab... I loved our waiter. He was efficient knowledgeable.. just dope as hell. Great to take someone out in a date as presentation is everything here. Food is delicious. Just next time? Crab. Real crab."}
{"text":"Came here because my boyfriends flight was delayed so I thought I would come try this as I had heard amazing things to kill some time!   To start the sushi is very very GOOD!  I had the citrus Yellowtail & the Hory Fork Roll! Both delicious and I will definitely come back again.  I give them 4 stars because of the atmosphere and the people that were dinning next to me (who were employees eating after a shift) extremely loud, vulgar and just annoying to be honest."}
{"text":"This place basically gets stars only because our waiter was the only guy who worked there who was super nice. Every one else who worked there were complete jerks. The food is super expensive, even with their happy hour pricing, and you don't get nearly enough to eat. Our group left making plans to go elsewhere to eat because everyone was still starving.  The bathrooms there are super obnoxious. There are no signs, so I asked a waiter directions, and he merely told me, \"Yes, we have bathrooms,\" and promptly left. Nice guy. I chanced a random hallway and ended up in what I thought was the guys restroom, because there was a dude there washing his hands at the counter.  No. You find a random closet to do your business, and everyone washes their hands together. Cozy. Except then you get to catch the waitresses who don't wash their hands. Oh yummy.  Our plates were dirty, there were flies everywhere. And it was disgustingly hot in there.  I suppose I should say something about the food. My buffalo chicken rolls were not bad (I'm pregnant so I'm not allowed to eat real sushi), and the chicken fried rice tasted like it was made from a box. The others said their Cali rolls were super bland.  There was one other waiter who was super nice too. I won't leave him out, so he'll make up the second star. But everyone else... Well, I can't blame them for hating their jobs I guess. Lol."}
{"text":"Service was terrible the server finally took my order, brought my app after my dinner and then didn't see the guy until I had to ask the front for my check.  It was a slow Tuesday night.  The people who work there are unprofessional.  When I went looking for the bathroom 4 of them were staying around talking about how attractive someone was at another table pointing and laughing.   Now the food, way too salty!!  I had a salad and sushi and I had to stop eating my food because it was so gross.   It was $30.00 for the 2 and I ate half of the gross food. This town has great places to eat and great service everywhere else but here."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday night. The service was impeccable and the sushi was all really good. I tried the Thai fried rice and Loved it. The rice was enough for 2 people. The cougar roll was a little weird but still really good. It was pretty expensive, but we did drink. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed myself! The food was awesome and my waitress Amy was the best! I'm telling all my friends and co-workers about this spot... The filet mignon and salmon skewers were delicious..."}
{"text":"The several times I have been for lunch, I have experienced great customer service.  Stopped in for lunch today with coworkers.  I had the Vegetarian roll which I found out isn't Vegetarian as it contains dashi.  This would be suitable to call pescatarian for those with dietary restrictions / allergies.  I am thankful our server was kind enough to inform me of this.  Figured I should share this new found information for Vegetarians or Vegans.  I think Squid Ink should update this, and remove that it's Vegetarian since it isn't.  I also had the miso soup which was good."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, excellent music, very cool patrons and staff.  The seaweed salad was excellent!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here on a Saturday... The restaurant was completely, which might have been the first red flag. I had the chicken teriyaki bowl and my husband had the beef and broccoli bowl. Although both items came with a choice of soup or salad, the portions of the entrees themselves were on the small side. The beef and broccoli can be described as \"just okay\" and the chicken on the chicken teriyaki was dry and didn't come with enough teriyaki sauce. We also ordered salmon nigiri which wasn't very fresh and tasted mediocre. We both left the restaurant still hungry. The only saving grace was the customer service."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi, made while you watch! Crab Rangoons and Beef Yakisoba are also amazing!! Our server was VERY slow -- we waited 20 min for the check and another 20 for our change!! All in all, though, a good experience!"}
{"text":"This place is inconsistent at best.  The first time my BF and I went there, it was amazing.  They had squid sashimi that melted in your mouth, along with many other delightful sushi and sashimi treats.  Then we took my best friend there for dinner.  It was terrible, we ordered a specialty roll that took over an hour to come out and when it did, it looked like vomit on the plate.  The squid sashimi that night was fishy and rubbery- a total letdown.  The waitress also had no idea about what kind of liquor they served.  We ordered sake and she made suggestions that were not only what we asked for, but terrible in quality... I won't be going back.  Also- seems to be sort of a hipster bar, but isn't terribly hip in my experience..."}
{"text":"Late night dining in downtown Phx can be dizzyingly desperate & disappointing   - but thankfully, Squid Ink brings us a wide array of options at 1130pm: potstickers, dumplings, & of course, delicious Pork belly! (We ordered 2.)Tons of dairy free & gluten free options too. Full bar, patio with misters on full blast; it's a sanctuary in the desert."}
{"text":"This place is ultra trendy. Which normally isn't something I enjoy. But I'm glad I gave this place a try. My husband and I started out with the crab Rangoon. They had actual chunks of crab in them! Crispy and delicious. We ordered the soft shell crab, spicy tuna, and Dragon rolls. Unfortunately I wasn't very impressed with the Dragon roll, which was very bland. The soft shell crab was nice though. The spicy tuna was pretty good as well, and had a good amount of heat.  The star of our experience was the sashimi platter. Each piece was tender and so fresh!  Nice little place. Steer clear of the rolls and stick with the sashimi."}
{"text":"Checked in on a Sunday and wasn't busy at 21:30.  People that were coming after us were eating before us and we ended up leaving at 22:33 because we still never got our food.  DEFINITELY WILL NEVER VISIT THAT ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"I've been there several times with my coworkers both for lunch and for happy hour.  Lunch specials are good. I had a rice bowl and it was filling and very yummy. Their sushi's fresh and I like their happy hour too. Good prices definitely attract County employees after 5 pm when we're done for the day.  Everything I've tried is delicious and the staff's extremely nice too. Definitely a good place to chill after work."}
{"text":"Had a great time at squid ink. Manager was very good and our waitress (Kaci) was awesome. This place is rocks ,highly recommend"}
{"text":"it was awesome  best place ever the staff is the most helpful  ,a young gal with blue tinted hair named kacey was awesome  don't go anywhere else for a good meal"}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times.  I'm not a seafood eater so I can't rate the sushi but the edamame, teriyaki chicken, and beef yakisoba are all awesome.  They have a good happy hour for saki bombers too!"}
{"text":"I came to grab dinner at this Japanese restaurant with fellow Yelper Kurdy S, and the experience was a big disappointment. I was initially impressed by the sleek, horizontal interior that included an outdoor patio, sushi bar, bar area, and a long stretch of booths and tables. The restaurant was relatively quiet considering the small and large groups of families that were dining there. They also have a few TVs for those eager to keep track of games and scores.  We ordered the Toyko Frites ($7) that came with shoestring fries sprinkled with seaweed and served with honey jalapeno and spicy aioli dips. The fries tasted rather ordinary and plain. The dips were very simplistic without hints of complexity. I don't think I would pay that much for fries to go with mayo-siracha dip.   The Assorted Sushi Platter ($18) came with eight pieces of spicy tuna roll, and nigiri that included unagi, ika, sake, tai, maguro, white fish, and ebi. The fish selection was ordinary and on the cheap side. The flavors were rather bland with dry spots, and I thought the red snapper had already turned.   I was particularly offended by my order of Ikura ($6) that was served half done! Apparently, the sushi chef had run out of salmon roe. He then had the audacity to serve a half way done Ikura and told me that I would be charged half the price for it. Presentation and precision are such a big part of the dining experience in Japanese cuisine. The restaurant should have let me know about this in advance and ask if there is anything else that I would rather have in its place. My face turned as red as the maguro when the order arrived at the table. I had the server to take it off the bill.  Service was grounded in Western paradigm and not very thoughtful at all. Prices were too inflated and the quality from food to service was sub par. I left in disappointment and will never want to come back here again."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch while at a conference for work downtown. I made the mile trek because well, i wanted sushi. Pretty big space, outdoor seating and a full bar (of which i sadly did not partake). Enjoyed some agedashi tofu and a cucumber wrap tuna roll - loved that they had a non-rice option since I'd already been on the carb wagon due to travel.   Quiet during lunch but i'm sure it picks up at night. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"First time I ate there the service was slow and the roll I ordered took forever. It was kinda warm, but tasty. Second time I sat at the bar. Everyone's drinks were empty and bartop was dirty, no sign of a bartender. Turns out he was taking a shit. Came out of the bathroom and hugged a couple waitresses - priorities. Eventually he made it back to the bar. I was there 10 minutes and bailed."}
{"text":"First time eating from here, I had food delivered from Postmates.  I got the Spicy Tuna rice bowl and all I can say is, I AM IN LOVE!!!  It was SOOO delicious and plenty of food, I couldn't finish it.  The Tempura eggplant was amazing, very flavorful.  For you fellow ginger lovers out there, their ginger was VERY good, white pickled ginger that is a tad sweeter than most places, but very good none the less.  Happy Customer, will be back!"}
{"text":"I've tried Squid Ink a couple of times. A little pricy for what you get and limited menu. The staff on the other hand is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Overpriced.  Sushi was bland.  Fried rice was so salty, we could not eat it.  Service was slow.  Waitress was not very friendly."}
{"text":"Not even close to good sushi, I have had better sushi from grocery stores. Steer clear of this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on a Sunday afternoon to grab some drinks and some Veggie rolls. Drinks were cold and made fast. The place was very clean and modern. Staff was excellent and very nice. I ordered 1 roll of the veggie rolls (rice, cucumber, and avocado wrapped in rice paper). It was 1 roll that was sliced into 5 pieces. They were pretty good, but not for $7. Yes, 1 roll for $7. I'm not cheap by any means but I thought for $7 the portion size was super small and not filling at all. Next time I'll try some other stuff and update my review. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Finally, a good sushi place I don't have to drive clear out to Scottsdale for! Great Happy Hour and reverse happy hour. The sushi and rolls were yummy. It sounds funny being you're at a sushi place, but try their wings on the appetizer menu. They are quite tasty. My only downfall with them is that they are pretty pricey if you're not eating off the happy hour menu so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the service or should I say lack of service brings down the rating for this restaurant. We first sat at the bar for drinks and dinner..after 5 minutes or so the bartender threw down the menu and just walked away. Not a good sign..so then we got up and sat at the sushi bar..not much better service with the exception of the sushi chef's made the evening much more enjoyable..we will go back but only sit at the sushi counter.."}
{"text":"Never been this frustrated or disappointed before after picking up a take out order.  Historically I have been given a complementary to-go cup of ice tea when picking up my order.  Today was told they stopped doing that.  When I asked the bartender to tell management that I really enjoyed it and was one reason that I would recommend this place to others I was told that they could not afford to do it anymore.  I said it was probably cheaper than advertising.  This became a back and forth argument which was unnecessary.  I said all I asked you to do was let management know I thought it as a great thing.  Was then directed to the manager who did nothing to try to satisfy my complaint and insisted that the cost of a to-go cup full of ice tea was unsustainable for the business instead of trying to understand where I was coming from.  I said they would definitely be getting a negative review from me and still they did not care.  So regardless of my past experiences or what I think of the food this experience was bad enough to make me want to tell others about it."}
{"text":"I had the pokeroll and the dirty rockstar roll. I enjoyed both and the atmosphere of the restuarant"}
{"text":"Definitely one of our favorite sushi places in the valley!! Awesome happy hour that lasts until 7pm and it's perfectly located right in the heart of CityScape... Not to mention the fact that their sushi is spot on! Nothing to wild or eccentric, but just the right variety to satisfy your raw fish craze!! Two thumbs up!!   ProTip: they validate for the underground parking in the lot between Central and 1st St!!"}
{"text":"Busy night on a late Saturday night. Not crowded though. Hidden gem away from the convention attendants.   Relaxing atmosphere, host attend to us quickly, server responded to us right away. A+ service so far.  Reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Great place, hard to see from Shea so it doesn't get the visibility it deserves. Fun atmosphere, big bar, TV's, large patio, good music and modern. We eat a lot of sushi and thought the food here was excellent, service as well. Kids are welcome which was a plus for us. Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"Although the wait was long for the food at 1pm on a Wednesday, the sushi was tasty.  I especially enjoyed the tempura roll.  Next time I will skip the garlic edamame though.  Nothing special there"}
{"text":"My first time here ! It's a very very load restaurant. I couldn't even hear what the person sitting across from me was saying. The happy hour was yummy! Good deal on sushi. The service staff was very nice but took a while to get our drink order .. We decided to hurry up and order food because we didn't want to wait a while to order. Sushi came really fast! I probably  would eat here again."}
{"text":"This location use to be good. Boy has it gone down hill since the City Scape location opened. Did take out today ordered dinner size chicken teriyaki asked for extra sauce and was told it would be ready  in 15 mins. It took about 35 and I got the lunch size and no teriyaki sauce on my food with a little cup of it on the side. The dine in experience is bad as well takes for ever to get your food. So don't have plans to go any where after at a specific time you'll miss it with there slow service"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday for dinner per a recommendation from a friend.  To start, this place has a pretty decent happy hour until 7pm every day  A few good drink specials, half price appetizers, and some specials on rolls. We arrived at 5pm and were immediately seated.    I ordered the Revolver- A vodka drink with ginger syrup ($5HH).  Great Flavor and just strong enough.  We ordered the shisito peppers ($2.5 HH).  Interesting, but not something I would order again.  We also ordered a few rolls- Philly($4HH), Flying Phoenix ($12 HH), and Hory Fook ($10 HH).  I loved the specially rolls.  The sauces complemented the fish and you could taste every ingredient/flavor in the roll.  The Hory Fook was too spicy for me but the hubby loved it.    So why the \"Meh. I've experienced better?\"- during our meal, we were pestered by a few nagging fruit flies.  Given that we had a view of the sushi bar, everything looks clean and orderly.  After finishing our meal while waiting for the check, I looked behind our book to view the artwork.  Right above our heads on the both were at least 20 fruit flies resting. EWWWWW.  GROSS!  We mentioned this to the server, but did not get a response from management."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff but due to the construction it's hard to get to and fly's buzzing around inside. The clear plastic chairs have to go, not a good look with an upscale sushi bar. I will check back in 3 months to see any changes."}
{"text":"Well...I heard it was special.  Not really. The food was average and the portions were not consummate for the price. Case in point was Tuna takeki. 6 small pieces for 14 bucks...ah, no thanks. I'll pass.   By the way, where is the squid ink name...no squid ink rice, really?  Better options available around town.   No more ink necessary"}
{"text":"Friend told me hot wings are the thing here. I thought he was nuts, it is a sushi place. Turns out, he was right. The hot wings here are excellent, and even better at happy hour.  Bottles of Tiger and excellent Hamachi also a plus.  The setting at the bar with friendly and quick servers and an inside/outside make Squid Ink a great place for happy hour when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Flies, flies, flies! Everywhere! We asked to be seated outside because they were literally crawling all over the inside windows. Our waitress was not friendly or helpful , she didn't take down our order correctly which normally would be cool if my tab wasn't wasn't 30$ for a roll and  a sake bomber I didn't order. The sushi wasn't bad, it wasn't special our overall experience was very negative (we're both in the service industry) not being harsh whatsoever we will not be returning"}
{"text":"Stopped in on my way to Stand Up Live Comedy Club, had a wonderful experience.  Friendly bartenderess, good sushi roll, excellent job!  If you're downtown, across from Cityscape, it's worth a try!"}
{"text":"Used to love squid ink. Mostly because of the bar but they have gotten some new bartenders that have put there egos and friends ahead of customers. The new male bartender has been very unfriendly multiple times. I just walked out because of his customer service."}
{"text":"we came here for quick drinks, service was poor and the food was mediocre"}
{"text":"The sushi is actually okay, but the service is so bad it's hard for me to get past it. The high turnover of pretty girls that don't smile gets very annoying."}
{"text":"At first I was not a fan and hastily judged them. They were new, I made it at point to tell people I didn't like it and never went back. Lately I've been back A LOT. They truly stepped up their game. My initial issue was they didn't have anything you could only get their.  That was it.  That has turned around, so many unique to them items to try. I tried something with Yellow tail with Grapefruit. Never had it anywhere else but damn it was good. The sho shito peppers are a fun little game of which one is gonna burn my mouth. It's only ever like 1 in 20 but finding its fun!  I am now rectifying telling people its not good and telling the internet i was wrong! It's Good!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful sashimi.  I ordered the tuna sashimi for $11.  I was expecting a nice serving of sashimi tuna.  What was delivered to the table was 6 small slices of tuna that had been completely cooked.  I asked the waiter why and he said that's how we serve it here ... \"Seared\".  If that is what they call seared I'm not sure they understand the meaning.  There was nothing even remotely pink about the tuna.  I believe it was old.  The edamame tasted like fish.  We will not go back."}
{"text":"Wish I could give a full review,  but we were never greeted by a server. Sat for over ten minutes at the sushi bar without even a hello from the sushi chef although he looked at us several times.  The hostess tried getting us a server as we were walking out. Too little to late. We will spend our money else where."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night for some Happy Hour! What a great place for some good quality sushi and drinks. Great Happy Hour pricing for a friday night till 7pm, better get there early because it does fill up pretty quick.  Down side, I live in Mesa and this place is a good 30 minute drive for me at that time but with that said, I would come back even with the drive for their food. Staff was awesome and service was great. Even with a mix up with the check, they made it right with no issues. Staff was friendly and personable and the manager was out and about helping as needed. Love seeing manages along side their staff helping and making it a great experience.  Food was really good. Had the vegas roll, spicy crab, phoenix, and buffalo I believe. All were perfect. Some where same as they should be but the item that stole the night was the Kobi Burger!  Great flavors and cooked just perfect. It was passed around the table it was so good. Perfect 10 on the taste and quality! Seasonings were on point and just couldn't get much better. Drinks were good, typical beer and saki selections. The table had a few of the martinis and they were pretty good. Not a big martini fan so dont remember the names but the table passed them around and sure did like them.   All in all! a must go when you are in the North Scottsdale area. Great Happy Hour, Great outdoor seating, appears to be a dog friendly place.   Out side of Happy Hour, might get a little pricey- just an FYI"}
{"text":"Pretty brief review on this one. Solid sushi, and a great spot to hit after a game/event/show. Drinks are good, they usually have a couple interesting beer choices. We have eaten here at least four times and have been pleased with the service and food each time. A little on the pricey side but it's location kinda makes that inevitable!"}
{"text":"Horrible HORRIBLE sushi and the worst beef Negimaki EVER!!! We ate here a few years ago and I couldn't even finish! We just left the food there it was that bad and sushi is our favorite food."}
{"text":"Horrible services. Staff is not great. Had to wait for food for a very long time. Had sushi it was okay. Not coming back here again."}
{"text":"We were looking for a sushi place while vacationing in Scottsdale. Squid Ink exceeded our expectations, from the food to the service, to the environment. We happened in during Happy Hour and ordered an over-abundance of food because of the great prices. The quality was excellent."}
{"text":"Squid Ink is delicious every time.   My favorite item here is easily the tootsie roll. It has just the right amount of crunch with the tempura flakes.  The shrimp tempura has an awesome and sweet sauce. The miso soup is very aromatic. We also had a Flying Phoenix roll and that was great.  My only complaint is the size of the rolls. The specialty roll was pretty big, but the others seemed very small. I never leave feeling full."}
{"text":"The sushi is good and the people are nice. It's not the best sushi I've ever had but I'm sort of a snob. It's a good place to go for happy hour and hang out with people. Good atmosphere and it's not that expensive. I recommend the Hory Fook roll (I know it's a weird name). Don't forget when you park at Cityscape to get your parking validated with your server!"}
{"text":"I came here on one of their opening nights and it was pretty busy. still was seated in a fast time. good service but I was asked about 12 different times how everything was, but I'm guessing it's because they were still brand new, not a big deal. very impressed and I will go back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch and to get some work done since they offer wifi. Ended up just having a pleasant delightful lunch. Jaque was my serve and was great, very attentive and genuinely personable. Great lunch!"}
{"text":"I'm from the new England area and I'm out here for work so we stopped in during our lunch break. Quite the tiny space they've got there, but they're doing best with what space they have. I ordered the surf and turf roll and my oh my was that filling! Unlike what my colleague ordered.. the crab hand roll...what a waste. It was mediocre, at best. I also ordered some edamame, which you can't really mess up lol the portion is rather large so feel free to share those. Now in regards to grading, they get three stars from me solely because the service wasn't that awesome... they forgot to bring our soup, brought dishes out at completely different times, so the awkward tension of should I eat my food now or starve until everyone has their food arose and there wasn't anything spectacular about this spots...just your average sushi restaurant. Definitely not a top five in my book. Would I go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"This place is always great food and good service! The prices aren't to bad and the portion sizes will fill you up."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere! Great sushi...the Cougar Roll is incredible! Service at the Sushi Bar was great. However, if you plan on sitting at the bar be prepared to wait for a while until you get service. I waited for about 10-15 minutes to order a drink and some sushi rolls when there were 2 bartenders back there and they weren't even busy. I moved to the sushi bar instead and got great service from both the waitress and the sushi chef."}
{"text":"This is literally the most bland sushi I've ever had in my entire life. I'm hardly an expert, but even the other location seemed better than this.   Cool layout, but that's about it. Might be back to drink"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of their rolls (a little overly creative without great taste behind it), but every time I go for lunch I get the sushi or sashimi lunch platter. You know, the basics. And they are AMAZING. The sashimi is so lovely. It's big slices of fish that are some of the most delicious sashimi I've had in PHX. I typically don't like salmon and I gobble this up. The sashimi lunch is $15 and I'd say its 4 slices of yellowtail, tuna, and salmon. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Great food and laid back atmosphere. Great for dates or a family dinner. Was not what I thought it was going to be. The food was excellent. There was something on the menu for everyone. I had a spicy vegetable rice bowl that was like nothing I've ever tasted. Glad I was able to try it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. On my last night in the Phoenix area, we hit up Squid Ink for dinner. Now, this isn't a tattoo parlor that serves food. It's a Japanese restaurant and a pretty fancy one at that. They have a nice patio, a bar area with some TVs (they were showing college football), and a seated area.   We started off with some apps: edamame and some potstickers. The potstickers were fried and they were average. For the main dish, we had the duck confit with fried rice. Not an item you typically see at a Japanese restaurant! The amount of meat you were given wasn't a lot and the duck could have used a marinade or sauce to give it some more flavor. Service was also really slow. I had to go up and ask for utensils since our waitress was taking so long to check in on us. Can't say the food is good as the restaurant looks but you can still get a decent meal here."}
{"text":"The sushi was good. reason I'm only giving 3 stars is because of the way the waiter asked me to throw away my drink. apparently you can't bring outside drinks. I had just bought a Starbucks from across the street and as soon as the waiter came over he told me I have 3 options. 1. chug the drink 2. throw it out or 3. leave. I find that rule ridiculous but still would  have left a higher review if the waiter wasn't rude about the situation. it was a waste of a Starbucks."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Had several different rolls, all very good and unique.  Roman was outstanding!  Happy hour everyday and all day Sunday!  This is my new favorite sushi place.  Dog friendly patio a plus!"}
{"text":"Cute, casual vibe! Decent food and friendly staff! Good for meeting for drinks and small bites. The Coconut Curry Shrimp is an absolute winner! Yummo!"}
{"text":"Just what downtown Phoenix needs!! Late night spot serving up FRESH sushi and adult beverages! Our server Asia was above and beyond friendly, and we had a chance to meet the owner and the GM. My only advice is to offer a reverse happy hour to draw in a crowd! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Staying in town for work, and was craving Asian food so I got the Thai chicken fried rice and miso soup to go. The order was ready in 10 minutes which is awesome and quick! Though probably not the best choice if you're craving real Thai food like myself - the soup was fine but the rice just tasted like it was coated in soy sauce. I wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"I fuck with this spot. The chef was a cool cat, came out and talked to us about all the different fish n what not. Some good insight. As a product of the increasing homogenization of society, I appreciate the personal touch. As a cali boy I won't lie 2 u, I've had some better fish in my day, but being as this place is in a land locked desert, they probably had the best around. Clean and lean. Lean and mean. Gave me 50% off on my beer. Good times."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times in hopes that the service and food would get better, but it hasn't. We came in last night as a big group, and we were seated right away. Our waitress came and got our drink orders around the table.  I ordered a Kirin. When she returned, she brought me a Kirin Light, put it on the table and walked away. When she came back, I said that I wanted a regular Kirin, and her response was \"Oh well that's all we have.\" Oooookay. Right when we started ordering our food, we let her know in the beginning that we were doing separate checks. She rolled her eyes and let out a big sigh like she was put out about it. When she told us that a certain item was not available, we told her that we needed a few more minutes and she threw the sushi menu back on the table and said she'd be back. When we got our appetizers, we didn't have utensils, napkins, or plates to share. When our waitress finally came around so we could ask for utensils and plates, we were almost done with our appetizers. She finally came back with a stack of plates, chopsticks, and napkins, but of all the places she chose to put them down was right next to my 5 year old niece's head (she had her head down because it was getting close to bed time). We even made space for the plates at the end of the table and told her to put them down there but she seemed determined to put them where she wanted. We barely saw her after that, and when she did come by, she would check on one side of the table and not the other.   I'm just really unimpressed with this place. I wish it would do better."}
{"text":"Love this place downtown but the Scottsdale location has no manners. Sat at bar for 10 min while bartender ignored us. No menu, no water. We walked out and they could have cared less."}
{"text":"We were running out of time trying to find a place to eat. So, this restaurant was close by and we decided to check this place out.  We had less than an hour to eat. We arrived at 6:30. We told the servers that we had an event to attend at 7:30 and they acknowledged the fact, but only two guys making sushi, I don't know. Took awhile to bring water,our Kirin Light $8 and edamame $4. It was just about 7 PM when we got our first order; Tobiko Nigiri $5,Shrimp Tempura Roll $10 and Seaweed Salad $7.50. There was a nice twist to the salad, had shredded radish on the top. We started with Edamame $4 and finished our meal with Kirin Light, big bottle $8 and Caterpillar $13, Shrimp Tempura $10 and Eel Cucumber $9, Rolls. All the food was fresh and nicely portioned. On a busy night expect to wait 30 minutes after sitting down for anything to be brought out."}
{"text":"Great location, great service and great food! Loved the Potstickers for an appetizer. If you're looking for a Sushi spot that's open late on the weekend, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'm just so confused how one person can love this restaurant so much and another the opposite hmm. I guess the only thing to do is try it myself, I'll be back to let ya know what I think and I'll will be perfectly honest and not super picky, cuz I'm not. I live near it so hopefully it's good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for happy hour. They have great deals on rolls and drinks. Eat outside and enjoy beautiful downtown Phoenix. #Phx"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for business and was staying at the Renaissance downtown. We happened to walk by Squid Ink and decided we had to give it a try. It was pretty busy that day so we decided to site at the bar outside. Although it was steamy that day, they had the mist sprayers going so it was comfortable. The atmosphere was great and the bartender was awesome.  I didn't catch his name but he was super friendly and provided us a lot of info about what to do in Phoenix since we were only visiting. To drink we started with a taste of the Arizona Peach Ale. I'm not a beer drinker but my boyfriend loved this and I thought it was pretty tasty. To each with ordered the Hory Fook roll which based on the reviews I see is a big hit.  It was delish and you can't beat the tempura jalapenos. We also ordered the Beef Negamaki which I only thought was so so. The pieces were pretty small and some of them were overcooked in my opinion. I would be interested to try more rolls as they all looked good, from what I saw.  This place has great ambiance, great music (90's hip hop) and people seemed to enjoy themselves there.  If you are in the area you should definitely check it out."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for the first time on Saturday night. We sat at the sushi bar on the left side of the restaurant. We were able to write down what we wanted and hand it right to the sushi chef which was convenient! We had a few different rolls (btw the buffalo chicken roll is soooo good!) and ordered cold Saki. The waiter told us that there were only a few bottles left and to keep that in mind if we wanted to order more which was cool! We got to watch the chefs make all the rolls and at the end of the night the chef made something special for us! We don't know what it was but it was AMAZING hahah! We will be back the atmosphere was great!"}
{"text":"Came here for an adoption event with Lucky Dog Rescue and we will absolutely be back!! They have a dog friendly patio with a bar that opens up to the outside. Crystal served us some tasty drinks at the bar (the bloody mary comes with a quail egg!) and our food was amazing. Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"I love sushi, so I get excited whenever a new sushi restaurant pops up! I'm not sure when this location opened but I came across it through Yelp reviews and decided to see what the fuss was about. The restaurant is average size, however they have a huge patio area and that is personally my favorite area. Looking through the menu they had cute names for their house rolls but I got a couple to try out - Cougar and Dirty Rockstar. Can we say delicious?? Every roll I had was fresh, clean and a party on my tastebuds. What's great is at night they had live entertainment. Only downside is the service can be iffy. The first time we had a server in training so I can understand however the second visit we had good service until it got slammed. She did not come by as often so that was a tad annoying. But that won't stop me as I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Squid Ink for the first time last night for our 22md wedding anniversary. Everything was just perfect -- food, service and atmosphere.   We were well-taken-care-of by our server Hunter, and the rest of the amazing service team, including Sarah (working expo), Kaci (another server who would check in on us) and the General Manager who opened our champagne.   We are looking forward to our next visit and highly recommend Squid Ink!!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is the owner, the food, the atmosphere, the servers, bar tenders, chefs are all excellent. Not just sushi try the Kobe burger, the wings, EVERYTHING IS FANTASTIC. Price is very reasonable with many happy hour deals. Sunday brunch is to die for, lots of music in the evenings and very kid friendly. I bring my grand kids for pbj roll anyway Go try for yourself now Sky has another downtown at Palomar hotel perfect stop before a basketball game...ENJOY YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"Been to squid ink a few times and I have to say that it's just average. Not good and not bad, just average. I do like the scene and ambiance and patio and location but not so much on sushi. We recently came for happy hour sushi and ordered California rolls and a Vegas roll and was disappointed. For $11 the Vegas roll was not worth the price. Cheap imitation sushi and dry. Possibly the worse Vegas roll ever. The California roll was dry as well and again cheap imitation crab meat. I will never order sushi here again. The only think I did like was the potstickers. Really good and great value on happy hour.   I think I will come back to squid ink for a drink and small finger foods. The service is always good, but I just won't waste my money on their sushi again. After trying them for a few times I don't think it's worth the money. Nice concept here, just needs to improve on their rolls."}
{"text":"I've been to many sushi restaurants and this one disappoints. Walking in to the restaurant is like walking into a Scottsdale nightclub, complete with \"cougars\" lounging about the bar area and mini-skirts galore. If this is your scene, congratulations, you've found your niche. If you're looking for great sushi, don't expect to find it here. Service was lackluster-- my waitress was relatively pleasant and helpful but the sushi chef was inexperienced, lazy, and was busy checking his Blackberry for most of the time I was there. They have unusual happy hour times and \"specials\" are nothing that fantastic, mostly drinks and a few rolls, like the Las Vegas (not appetizing to most sushi fanatics).   To sum up: go here if you're looking to be a part of a \"hip\" scene, where looks are more important that service or sushi."}
{"text":"This is a nice place near my home.  The sushi is decent but not earth shattering.  I like the atmosphere since it is pretty upscale for this corner and it is a nice date place.  The Vegas roll was good and the spicy tuna and yellow tale we OK.  I think I will try some other things here next time even though I enjoy having a little sushi every once in a while.  I hear the happy hour specials are awesome here but haven't stopped in for that yet.  The bar is very hip and I can see a happy hour coming on soon on the patio now that it is cooling off."}
{"text":"Their Sushi is delicious,  the rice was perfect, fish was perfect, seaweed was perfect.  Everything about the roll was perfect.  One of my favorite sushi places.  Their menu is amazing as well as their employees.  Friendly and fast service.  I will definetly be back when I'm around that side of town."}
{"text":"The udon noodles were decent! As far as the sushi rolls I would have to say they were not fresh you can tell the tuna had been sitting out for a while. Also the prices were extremely high for a spicy tuna! I never review any of these restaurants but I had to share my opinion!"}
{"text":"Completely ordinary, average not so tasty food.  Loud Music, thank god for the booze."}
{"text":"I would give 2 stars but the food is good. Service is terrible slow. Went on a Saturday night took 15-20 minutes to get our beer.  Our server forgot to put in our appetizer and it came just before our meal. The mgr did comp it for us, but still, was surprised the server never checked in with us.  They brought my husbands meal from the kitchen 20 mins prior to our rolls being served, his meal was cold by the time we ate.  He ordered a second beer and they advised him they only had warm glasses and asked of that would be ok.... I come back because the food is good, but the service needs some help!"}
{"text":"Squid salad was very mediocre.... you would think that if you had a place named Squid ink you would have a great squid salad or dish of some kind.. right? Service was really great though, location was great, prices were a little high. Over all... prob 3.5."}
{"text":"There was absolutely nothing about my experience here that was good. I came here with my family on Easter, we were coming home for a day out fishing at the lake and stopped in for dinner. We waited to be seated, was told to seat ourselves. We asked for a high chair seeing as we had a 1 1/2 year old with us, and never through out the visit did the server bring one. We got our water but we ordered a coke because a member of our family is a diabetic and their sugar was dropping, we then waited much longer than what it takes to pour a drink for it to come out. When ordering, it was a battle to add a protein to the ramen, which on the menu states add your favorite protein yet we had to argue with our server. And waiting and waiting for our check, with a squirming small child that we never got a high chair for was obviously inconvenient. How ever the worst part was after the terrible service, I chose not to tip, and one of us contributes our time to secret shopping however it was not me so I felt it necessary to let them know that they would've failed. And did not tip because if you do not do your job, which is providing good service why should I tip you? About 15-20 minutes after we left, the server messages me on Facebook. HE TOOK MY INFORMATION OFF MY CREDIT CARD SLIP TO FIND ME!! This is so completely and totally unacceptable and I called and spoke to a manager and they refunded my money for the meal, which ok that was not the problem, I have money. What they found acceptable was just to write up the server because in managements words \"he has been here forever\" Who says this is the first time he has done this? Most people probably wouldn't come forward if they were embarrassed about not tipping, I am not embarrassed. I did not tip because we received HORRIBLE service not because we do not have money. And apparently to this establishment it is acceptable for their employees to take customers information off credit card receipts when they're \"not in a good place\"  I felt violated and unsafe knowing that someone can take my information off my credit card receipt and the repercussions for BREAKING THE LAW is just a piece of paper. And I just don't want this to continue happening because if that's all they're willing to do who says he won't do it again?"}
{"text":"First dinner. Excellent. Revolver, miso cod starter, citrus yellowtail and a bowl of rice. Everything was fantastic even the rice which was cooked just right. The service was prompt and awesome - BTW Kaci, love your hair! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Poor quality & deceptive descriptions  Buyer beware - crab does not mean crab meat - it means white fish preformed into little fish sticks and covered in red food coloring.  We went here for lunch and selected the Dragon Roll & the Cougar Roll for two of our items.  On the menu, both rolls had \"crab\" as well as \"spicy crab.\"  The Cougar Roll also had \"snow crab\" in it.  Both rolls arrived with imitation crab (or more aptly named \"crap krab\").  No where on the menu did they mention that they used imitation crab (basically white fish with red food coloring).  We asked our waitress, and she stated that anywhere on the menu that listed \"crab\" it was actually \"crap krab.\"  So the crab is crap krab and the spicy crab is crap krab.  But, the Cougar was supposed to have real \"snow crab\" so they took it back to have it prepared properly.  The roll I received back was hastily made and messy.  Certainly not made with the care that I would expect for rather small $13 sushi dish.  Barely any snow crab in it and looked liked they had thrown it together. In addition, the menu said the rolls were $12 but they tally sheet that you ordered it on said $13 and we were charged $13.  Our waitress acknowledged the difference and said it had been a problem for a while.  The waitress handled the situation very professionally and the iced tea was really fresh and good.   But, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my wife there last week. Excellent ambience at new restaurant, very good service, but the food was mediocre at best, no flavor, definitely missing something. Had three different chicken selections (2 tapas) as well as as chicken fried rice. Chicken was sliced and appeared to be boiled before being made into dinner, not good. Sorry, but not coming back. Really wanted to love it."}
{"text":"I would honestly give this restaurant place a ZERO star review if I could. We are regulars here and know Libby closely. However I have visited this location at least three times in the last year and the service is HORRIBLE. What an all time low for this restaurant. So disappointing to see this place so inattentive to customers and unwilling to make things right. Tonight I went here trying to gain the respect of this place again and once again utterly disappointed. We sat there for 15 minutes completely unattended without water on the table. We honestly just walked out and no one said a single word to us. This place once used to be my go to restaurant but now it's gone by the waste side. Not worth your time."}
{"text":"PLEASE READ... I give this review for a multiple of reasons. One I reject the statement made by another that because the chefs are not Asian they made that a statement in there review how that would affect the quality I don't know. I have always appreciated the service and the quality of food. The complaint of expensive came up, the restaurant it is not inexpensive, but not over the top as many establishments are.  I usually do not sit at a table but did because of family. A situation arose.....The management was quick to resolve the issue,  and  I thank them for that. I am by myself most the time, but brought my husbands grandparents (who are not easy to satisfy) and the people next to us  offended them,but except for the disruption they really enjoyed the experience, food was great,and I also appreciated the establishment for accommodating and responding to the situation. I don't know everyones names who were working that evening but THANK YOU ALL....I hope you never second guess this place its perfect for young and old. If you are ever unhappy just tell them they will fix it....Don't write negative reviewes  until you have tried to resolve an issue waitstaff work hard to resolve mistakes.... It is how they resolve them is what counts!"}
{"text":"Went to Squid Ink for my anniversary and was seated by the hostess. 15 minutes later we still had not been greeted by a server or even given drinks. There were only THREE tables in the entire restaurant. When we got up to speak to a manager, the hostess claimed to have never seated us (despite not only seating us but explaining the happy hour specials). After calmly explaining that we had been seated by her and given menus, she continued to play dumb. The manager didn't even offer to get a server for us, he just gave us a free entree card and told us to try them again another day. I will NOT be back to this location. It ruined my anniversary."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in the heart of Phoenix. Tried the Charbroiled Calamari, the Pokémon, and the Dirty Rockstar and it was on point! The service was also excellent. Will definitely go again when I travel to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Sushi!    The customer service I received was great!  Its was little more than most sushi places.  It doesn't seem like it on the menu but the portion I got was pretty small.   I don't mind I don't eat much.  However it was misleading. The place has a trendy feel to it,  to make the most of your money sit outside so you can view downtown phoenix.    I thought the sushi was pretty good, I mean there are better places but for the service and location I think this is a great option.  Parking downtown is extemely difficult."}
{"text":"We are frequent visitors to Squid Ink... as well as most of our neighbors. The one thing that is agreed on about this place is the music is great, however the service is awful. It ALWAYS takes at least 15 minutes to even get acknowleged by your server (when there not busy). The food is decent...tonight the tuna that we got was EXTREMELY smelly and had to be sent back...then out roll came out with the same nasty tuna in it. When we sent it back we were faced by attitutude. The manager came over and said he would replace the roll...which took 35 minutes to get.   I understand things happen...however this is starting to become the norm. When we are spending over $200 for 4 people I expect decent service.  We have talked to members of management twice now. Neither time were we looking for a freebie...we were talking to them with genuine concern. This is a great place that is close to home...we dont wanna see it go outta business. Hopefully someone cares enough to make the staff care about their jobs and their customers."}
{"text":"Pretty good, but nothing special.   THE TEMPURA GREEN BEANS were a delicious appetizer (4 STARS).  The tiger sauce + lemon zest was a delicious combination- sweet and sour with a touch of spicy.  I'd recommend this appetizer.   We got the SPICY SALMON, EEL (3 STARS) , YELLOWTAIL (2 STARS- too fishy!), and a house roll called THE DIRTY ROCKSTAR (3.5). I thought the sweet chili sauce and jalapeno complimented each other well on the dirty rockstar.    However, their prices are steep; unfortunately, the sushi is much too average to warrant 4 stars.    The service was unremarkable."}
{"text":"Sushi was below average and customer serviced sucked, the worst I ever had. I thought I was in an episode of Bar Rescue, waiting for Jon Taffer to come in a rip the staff because they were goofing off. Plus, it took an average of 20 minutes just to make one sushi roll, and it wasn't even packed. If you want better sushi, better customer service, and a better atmosphere, you need to go to Kabuki in West Gate! This is my first and last time going there, it was a joke!"}
{"text":"In for a trade show and needed a non carb meal in a hurry. Squid Ink was recommended to me. Tina saves the day. She expedited my sashimi meal and it was terrific! This is a busy place - don't come ready to eat but do come hungry."}
{"text":"excellent service from Kaci, I'm a big fan. everything was delicious, but the yakitori meats and wings in particular, were really great."}
{"text":"This joint is brand spankin new, so I wanted to visit at least twice before writing anything that would alter the course of the universe. So I did, just stopped in for happy hour sushi and a beer.  The place is very clean, crisp and neatly decorated. The staff can be described the same, but with a smile! The first experience was dinner with my charming husband. This place is so close to us that we were excited to try it. So excited in fact, maybe that's what made our sushi just OK. I chalked it up to drying paint on the walls, but after visit numero dos.......it's just OK.   The good is that their spicy tuna is actually spicey! The bad is that the rice just didn't seem to be fresh, it was all dried out and texture was off. The pickled ginger was totally dried up! (how do you screw up PG!) Anyway, I also had the salmon Nigiri-sushi and the fish was...well, warmish. It tasted good but I couldn't get over the temp! Everything has a good taste but I can't say that it is fresh and damn it, if sushi is being served it should look, feel and taste fresh!! I am a bit of a sushi snob, so I'm being harsh I know. I will go again to see if any progress has been made. Peace."}
{"text":"This place is doing many things right. Great food and killer service!  Walked in ten minutes to close (without realizing it, honest) and was still served in a professional manner. The manager on duty (who I later found out is the GM) Adam, definitely takes serious care of those who dine at squid ink! Your food is great and with such rad staff, I will absolutely come back for more, much thanks!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't come here unless it's happy hour, but kinda the only legit sushi choice downtown since Moira is a shit show"}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant is decent at best, it is an overpriced downtown eatery where your paying for the location and not the food. Save some money and get out of downtown.  First time I experienced a restaurant that messed up on an order and did not leave the mistake food at the table or put it on the house. Can you say penny pinchers !"}
{"text":"Happy hour is awesome! My wife loves the cougar roll. I was shocked how much I loved the spicy crab roll, amazing. The yellow tail nigiri was also quite good (as it should be). I came back to my original post and changed form four stars to five. This place gets better every time. Service and food are amazing. AND I am treated really well even though I almost always order happy hour items. Started tipping 25-30% to make it fair.   You can't order happy hour take out.. if I could do that, I'd eat there a lot more. It is a the best sushi place I have been to for kids. My 6 and 4 yo's love it."}
{"text":"We ate 5 different rolls. All were delicious. Had a sort of beef sausage- it was okay. Craft cocktail was okay, but paired perfectly with sushi. Atmosphere was nice and not too loud. Good place to bring a date."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last Saturday for my birthday dinner. Beautiful Resturant plenty of room for my table of 10, friendly staff and the food was D-lish. I had a great time there and will defiantly go back."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner before a show at Stand Up Live, as none of us had been there before. We shared a couple of appetizers to start, edamame, roasted garlic edamame, green bean tempura, and potstickers. I tried the potstickers and green bean tempura which were very good, I'd highly recommend the green bean tempura. I'm very boring when it comes to sushi, so I just had the california roll and spicy tuna rolls which were good.  To finish off, we shared the green tea ice cream and hawaiian bread pudding. The bread pudding is out of this world good, the green tea ice cream was pretty basic. The prices were good and the service was also good, I'd return."}
{"text":"I was the only Asian in the joint.  Having said that, I found the young ASU sourced staff very attentive and friendly.  I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen, and got Top Ramen in a dark tasteless soap.  Literally, the ramen was still square and curly just like I use to \"cook\" it in college - never stirring it while boiling! The buta-niku (grilled pork-belly) and soft-boil egg was the saving grace.  And it was in a very deep bowl.  With chopsticks and big spoon, I ate like I was performing laparoscopic surgery.  My suggestion, add some mung sprouts to bulk it up so the soup level can reaches the rim!"}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place! The atmosphere is great! The service is excellent! Will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. We loved it & will be back soon. The Cougar Roll is incredible!"}
{"text":"Located in CityScape downtown Squid Ink has a killer happy hour.   Perusing through the menu I found much to my delight! The philly roll and the spicy salmon roll were fresh and small. I prefer small rolls, the kind you can actually fit in your mouth and not have to awkwardly bite in half with chop sticks. I also had the green bean tempura, and the chicken wings which are chargrilled, bathed in siracha and served with shiso ranch. The star of the show was the miso black cod, pan seared and served with leeks, the miso glaze was intoxicating.   I couldn't believe how cheap the dinner and 2 sake bombers turned out to be.   DID I MENTION HAPPY HOUR IS EVERY DAY UNTIL 7!!"}
{"text":"First visit was amazingly great =5.  Fresh and tasty albeit not cheap. Next visit was less than satisfying of expectations =3 (and that is a generous 3) since their kitchen was \"closed\" so NO cooked/hot items. Not even able to steam or microwave the edamame.  Raw fish n seaweed salad only (which I love) but was very disappointing. Only reason they received a 3 instead of 2 was because they supposedly had a kitchen fire. Would have been nice to know prior to being seated with cocktails. IMO, mgmt did not handle this well."}
{"text":"Terrible sushi, good hot sake because.. how can you f up on sake?  We came here after our New Year's celebration next door, which was supposed to be a rooftop party that got rained out.  Well things happen, but we enjoyed that and afterwards walked from blistering cold to here for some food and drink.  Sushi bar closed, so hot sake only and we promised them we would come back the next day and we did.  Here's the review..  The customer service no doubt is really good!  We ordered their $12 Rainbow Roll.  Price is about right, as it usually cost that much.  The Roll came, the presentation looked really good with the special 'L-shaped' dish.  But, I immediately notice that the imitation crab was not mixed up with mayo in being broken up mixed with mayo and instead it was just a plain old imitation crab stick itself inside the roll.  Ok, fine.  First bite, it did not give me the heavenly feel, a good rainbow roll would give.  The fish tasted bland; poor quality fish.  The roll was bland all together.  They should have at least had mayo mixed into their imitation crab to at least give it some kind of flavor.  Tasted like Safeway sushi.  They probably did buy from Safeway and took it out of the case to earn a few extra bucks to sell here.  The roll was so cold.  RIce did not tasted fresh.  Horrible!  While we eating their sushi, I was thinking to myself, should I grade them like an actual sushi restaurant since I didn't pay attention to their full restaurant name on whether or not, they included sushi as part of their name, but yes, they do have sushi after Squid Ink.  So there, I can review them harshly.  If it wasn't for the customer service, I would have given them 1 out of 5.  I would not be back for their sushi; but drinks, yes.  I am not a sushi chef and I can make wayyyyyyy better sushi than this!"}
{"text":"Waitress was nice, food was very good. Got the crab rangoon, ultimate philly, and a bowl of ramen. Don't recommend the ramen though, super plain. They give you a good amount of everything, even the glasses the drinks are served in. Came for the sushi though and was a 5/5. Will come back soon!"}
{"text":"I went in during a slow afternoon and ordered the las vegas roll, it was just ok. The service is better than the food. Nice to have options for sushi downtown, but I now go to Harumi a few blocks away for my sushi fix. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"Great service,  great sushi, the lemonade is delicious! Blue moon on Draft also great! Would return!"}
{"text":"I love trying different sushi restaurants around Phoenix. Unfortunately I was truly let down when I finally got around to Squid Ink. I chose potstickers and deep blue cocktail but on a Tuesday at 7pm they already ran out of ingredients for both. Their Rangons were good enough but I could and have made them just as good. They do take a while so $7 is a decent price for the appetizer. But the drinks and sushi were extremely pricey and at the end of the night our waiter forgot about us. We had to go to the front to ask for the check. I'm never going back. Not as long as ahai Hana  and kabuki exist in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Brand new. Opened up 5 days ago. Just beginning to work out the bugs. Waited a little long to be served but once we got going the service was spot on. Shrimp and yellow curry was awesome. Desert was green tea ice cream. Not impressed. We will be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place has great sushi for a good price. Great selection of wine. Best crab rangoons anywhere! I recommend the hory fook roll."}
{"text":"Sushi Sushi Sushi!  What's not to love about it?  Well when it's done right your only complaint should only be you wanted more.  We've been wanting to go here since it opened.  We finally had a chance to dine here over the weekend.  Saturday night prime time dinner time as a walk in and we got lucky.  They seated 4 of us almost immediately at a cozy booth.    Our waiter was very helpful at describing the different sushi they offered.  If you like spicy rolls like I do then don't hesitate to order the Dirty Rockstar.  All around perfect sushi roll done right and with the right amount of heat.  The food was great and the service was as it should be.  No complaints at all.  I will be returning to Squid Sushi to try some of their other rolls."}
{"text":"It was good. Nothing special. We were at the rumble on central and our sushi was taken to another table and there were no comps and little apology. The cougar role did blow me and my girl away! It was a cucumber role with sweet chili sauce. I've had better but I set a high bench mark so they shouldn't feel too bad... I just probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"declining service since the new year for the 3 or 4 times that i have been back. place doesn't run the same anymore. rather than rely on quality customer service for business, these guys would rather rely on their location at cityscape. and with a location like that, they will probably always get business. and good for them. some people are fine with complacency."}
{"text":"So amazing!  My husband and I stopped here before starting our Valentines weekend date day/night. I am so glad we did!  Very clean black, white, and gray decor which was surprisingly warm and inviting.   Service was very fast - we were here on a Sat for lunch. Our server was nice and attentive with drinks and such but didn't hover which I appreciate.   Sushi rolls: Vegas roll did not disappoint and the Hory Fook was delicious and had the right amount of heat with the tempura fried jalapeño slices on top. Yum!  Crab Rangoon: 5 HUGE triangles with large pieces of crab inside. Also very good.   Miso soup (basic variety but still tasty) came with our lunch specials which run 11am-2pm including the weekends!! Score.   I had the curry shrimp bowl - quite possibly the best yellow curry sauce I've ever had. I usually like things super spicy but this has so much flavor it didn't need the heat. I believe it came with 5 colossal shrimp - I lost count. Portion was enormous; took the leftovers home for family.   My husband had the Thai chicken fried rice which he said was done very well and he didn't talk much when eating it so it must've been damn good.   We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere- excellent food. All the house rolls are amazing looking- we got the ultimate philly to start- yum!!! Happy hour prices are great- half off basically. Cool bar that's half inside half outside. Server was cool and super excited to serve - it was slow (only open 2 weeks) but definitely will be coming back. Open till 12am on weekends!"}
{"text":"Very good food and nice atmosphere, also the service was A+.  4 star because it was a little pricey and even the food was good the value was not great, I guess you pay for location (middle of downtown Phoenix)"}
{"text":"Disappointed with their service and they did not come back to take order. Myself I am sushi chef and do not like the way how they prepare the sushi. One of our Co worker burn lips from excessive hot sauce in sushi. Their chef should have taste the batch before use it in sushi."}
{"text":"We were at squid ink last night w our party of 8. They were packed at 5pm. We decided to sit outside being there was a 40 minute wait inside. Its weird how some visits to this place are amazing, the food is wonderful, great service etc etc. Last night our food came out in rare form. Sweet potato fries that had a thread in them and seemed bottom of the batch. Our sushi was good...just small portions of fish, we had a philly roll and spicy salmon. Our Garlic Edamame had 3 Garlic pods. My friend got vegetable tempura which again, looked like small end of the batch pieces...we are on a break as of now from this place. Hit and miss at best."}
{"text":"I visited squid ink this past Saturday for my friends birthday and lets just say my socks were rocked.  A friend and I shared the sashimi platter and the cougar roll both outstanding! The sashimi platter came with salmon, yellowtail (my fave), ahi, octopus, and because the server told me there was albacore even tho there isn't albacore. The fish was some of the freshest I have had in phoenix.  The cougar roll consisted of spicy crab mix avocado and some other stuff with a cucumber wrap. Light and delicious. I also had the pleasure of meeting the owner, Schuyler, very nice and pretty darn cute too ;)  I will definitely be back. Squid ink is my new go to for sushi!"}
{"text":"impressive food, and service.  That in the rush of the comicon crowd that day, the server took the time to investigate, and address my friends allergy concerns before he ordered was much appreciated.  I had the Kobe Burger with an egg on top, and seriously this was like eating a Kobe beef McMuffin. This was so delicious, it was almost a sinful indulgence. My friends and I enjoyed our meals.  we felt the service was great."}
{"text":"Love this place. Nice little patio with heaters. Good service. I'm vegetarian and so far I've only tried the sesame yuku kale salad and fried tofu, which is so awesome I keep ordering it.  I've tried several beers and a cocktail too, all of which were excellent.  One of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a beautiful March afternoon with friends. Miso soup was a little bland. Ordered the Pokémon roll and can't wait to reorder it next time. I will also try one of their drinks from the bar, as I only ordered water this time."}
{"text":"Great fresh fish.. Great quality, especially for Phoenix. I'm a sushi snob from Cali.. I only like a few sushi places here locally, this is one of them."}
{"text":"This is the type of sushi establishment that's more of a place to see and be seen than to enjoy a quality meal. That's why all the effort goes into a posh-looking bar. That's why the sushi has funny names (lol Pokemon Roll so kawaii) more memorable than quality.   Against my better judgment, I decided to go with a simple, tempura roll. The Vegas. It was executed quite poorly, as it was almost flavorless (how do you manage that when it has unagi?), and very gummy, indicating it was...uh...undercooked. Portion size was also questionable for the price, which would never bother me if the quality was at least average. I can legitimately say it's the worst Vegas roll I've ever had. I have had better sushi on several college campuses.   Next are the uninspired cocktails. Shiso leaf left untouched is a cool marketing tool to make a cocktail sound vaguely eastern, but it's neither flavorful nor aromatic enough when chilled to be anything more than an unfamiliar garnish in an otherwise forgettable libation. Only the \"City Escape\" stands out. Everything else is just a shot, some fruit juice, and some muddled \"seasonal\" fruit. How special can these drinks be if ingredients are strikingly interchangeable? Where is the cucumber? Lychee? I am disappointed. Oh, and the happy hour is pretty lame. IIRC, there's no reverse HH, something I'm more than happy to find down the road at 11pm.   A sushi bar that messes up sushi is already looking at 2-star territory. Atmosphere is nice and trendy, but that's negated by below average value. I'm still open to giving it another try someday, so I won't go any lower."}
{"text":"I would eat the sashimi salad every single day, if that didn't cost me close to $500 a month. It is a spring mix, seasonal vegetables, chef's selection of assorted fish, and a japanese vinaigrette. The selection and amount of fish never disappoints! I'll sometimes switch up the vinaigrettes too.   I have a hard time ordering anything else, but I did it, and I was happy with everything! The house rolls- very creative, fresh and good, just a little pricey especially if you want to try a few. I would stick with an assorted sushi or sashimi platter.   Cucumber-lemon water...pretty basic concept, but amazing. Get a to-go cup. Beer selection is decent- the cocktail menu is better!  Service at the bar has always been friendly and quick. I haven't seen a pooch there, but Yelp says it allows pets. Even better!"}
{"text":"I met my teenage daughter and her friend for lunch there one day and I was not impressed.  The service was great but the sushi was sloppy, tasteless and way overpriced.  We ordered four different rolls between the three of us and left most of it behind.  Not that my 50.00 dollar lunch will make or break them but I don't see them staying in business very long if they don't fix their food."}
{"text":"I called in a to go order and they said 15 minutes. I showed up in 20 minutes and they were just now starting to make it. I had the octopus sashimi. The flavor was good, but a bit chewy. The citrus yellowtail sashimi was a good flavor combo.   As expected, this place was a bit pricy for the amount of food you get, but it's good for trying more exotic meats and flavors you can't find at everyday restaurants."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out.  Nice outdoor space and good music.  Sushi is tasty but the rolls are small.  Would go there again.  Service is great"}
{"text":"It was not great sushi and that's why, even though I enjoyed my time here, I am only giving 3 stars.  Great location. Cool, if a little pretentious, atmosphere. Water with cucumbers and stuff like that. We didn't order any drinks; thought the prices for drinks were absurd considering it didn't look like most of the cocktails had a lot of alcohol content.   First thing we ordered was the sushi lunch platter. They brought out something that was different than what was on the menu but I ate it anyways. The sushi was not good. Tasted like what you find at Whole Foods or similar groceries; bland and stale. Not spicy at all. The sashimi were tasteless and strangely warm, which was unpleasant. Also ordered the coconut curry shrimp bowl, which was pretty tasty. My complaints are that the sauce was too sweet and rich, which made it feel kind of gross in my stomach afterwards. Also, $13 for some rice, four shrimp, and a boatload of sweet curry is just asking a little much. Would have enjoyed a few more veggies or more shrimp.  Service was good. Weird bathroom scenario. Would give it another try but not order sushi here."}
{"text":"So... This is gonna be kinda a weird one, guys. Because I went to a sushi bar, and had zero sushi.  I hear it's good though. Instead, I had the best damned old fashioned I've had in a long time.  Gin is for the summer.  It's fresh and crisp, and should be enjoyed on a patio. Whiskey, on the other hand, is for the cold. It is in hand when you are wrapped up in scarves and coats, battling the cruel Arizona winter, just trying to survive.  I am careful about where I order an old fashioned.  They require more than throwing some maraschino cherry that is an unnatural hue of red in a glass with a slice of orange and some booze.  No no no.  They need a gentle touch.  For this reason I never would have ordered one at a sushi bar.  But the bartender insisted I would not be let down, and I wasn't  Oh the joy of an old fashioned done right.   The faint hint of orange peel, the slight sweet of a cherry, the bitters marrying with the whiskey in a blissful union.  Yes.  Yes the bartenders at Squid Ink can make one helluva Old Fashioned.  And you know what?  The curry shrimp dish isn't half bad either.  The ambiance was nice, and the staff was on point."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good, meat (chicken) portions small, not cooked in the traditional Japanese method and prices on the high end."}
{"text":"The manager with all the tattoos was a total jerk! We sat down while there was barley anyone in the restaurant and he decided to make a scene because we weren't sat by the host. It was 11:15 at night and the place was empty. He then decided to tell us to leave because I asked him if we could sit in the high top table that obviously no one else was trying to sit in. Even afer my girlfriend ask if we could just get a drink he became belligerent. Must have Been all the roids. The guy had to be 45 -50 years old  no wonder squid ink has gone out of business in multiple locations  I will NEVER go to this place again  The guy Managing this place should be fired!   Totally a joke for customer service"}
{"text":"First off - our waitress (cute lady with the pink hair) was super friendly and attentive (Cory - I think).  We had three rolls and I wish I could remember what they were called but alas, I cannot.  I know they were spicy! One of them had a jalapeno on top of each roll! Very, very good and very fresh!"}
{"text":"What happened?  This place use to be so good, we would go a couple times s month.  I believe they changed management and supplier?  Just not the same."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat and hang out.  Great atmosphere, food is really good!"}
{"text":"The food was average but the service was terrible. Not worth the price or the drive here."}
{"text":"Love to give this more stars.. The cod app was amazing .. But very very small.. Sushi was not very good. The hostess was nice.. But looked like she should be at a strip club the way she was dressed! Waitress was great! Hunter!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the overall experience of this restaurant. I thought the food here was pretty good, I also came in time for some happy hours prices. The main reason I can't give Squid Ink more than 3 stars in their service. I came on a Friday night and they seemed very understaffed.   I think the location is great, but this specific spot has had multiple restaurants come and go, if they don't change things like service, they won't last.   The menu has a lot of choices and I was able to try different things, but nothing stood out. This is a pretty uninspired review, similar to the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is bomb!!! Chef nick makes the best roll!!!! Definitely will come back!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love sushi and try to find the best places in the valley.  I would say this place has a good selection of specialty rolls and basic rolls.  They are good across the board especially if you go during happy hour for the price.  I would say it was just good nothing special that stands out from others."}
{"text":"Food tastes very fresh and prices seem very fair.  Good service as well.  Can be a bit loud inside but outside is very nice if the weather allows.  Patio has heaters as well."}
{"text":"Decent food but the service was definitely  lacking.  The hostess looked like a tramp; she drags her feet over the floor the waiter who  had maybe four tables acted like the world was going to end.    They kept asking us if they remembered the ice....I said no just bring me the check.  I wont return."}
{"text":"I visited this location with a group during Phoenix Comic Fest. We arrived at about 5:30 on a Saturday and were seated right away. Our table location felt pretty cramped but otherwise the atmosphere was quite pleasant, not too loud, and the service was good.  I had the Tune in Tokyo cocktail to drink, and it was AMAZING. I'd definitely order that again. For my main dish, I ordered the duck confit bowl, but the server returned to inform me that duck wouldn't be available for another two hours. That was a bummer, but there were still plenty of other appealing choices. I went with the Beef Short Rib Bowl.  The restaurant was really filling up at this point but our food didn't take long to come out. I loved my dish. The beef short ribs had an amazing and deep flavor; the only negative is that a few of the pieces were really large and awkward to eat with chopsticks. The flavors within my bowl contrasted and complemented each other well, from the freshness of the rice to the acidic tang of the kimchi to the softness of the egg. Great stuff all around.  I've already told my husband that he needs to come here with me sometime when we're in downtown. Maybe then I can try the duck... and that macadamia nut bread pudding..."}
{"text":"I work downtown and frequently come here for lunch. My last experience was a total bummer! Me and a co-worker were sat and got drinks immediately but waited over 30 minutes to get our food order taken. We watched the waitress take other tables orders, all of which, were seated after us. The waitress(Samantha) gave a lame excuse so we asked for the manager. Dave, the Manager, was also all about excuses that made no sense. When we finally got our food, 45 minutes later, we never did get our soup that comes with our lunch order. Dave told us we should have asked for it. The staff is ALWAYS iffy and ever-changing. There seems to be a lack of management overall. Dave did give us 50% off but professionalism would have gone farther with us. I say the negative about the employment at Squid Ink but their food is outstanding. I have never had a dish that was not wonderful."}
{"text":"Marginal. Extremely marginal.  Food and wait staff alike. Only positive experience was the blue haired girl. She was kind and was actually attentive.  Bummer. Hate to leave a bad review but it is what it is."}
{"text":"I try to eat at every sushi place that opens and is within an hour of where I live. I went to squid ink and was mildly impressed with the sushi. The service was average and left me wanting for a more authentic atmosphere. I would eat at this place again, if someone else was paying. This place is a hard 3 out of five, as far as sushi goes."}
{"text":"Great sushi and service to our random party of 13 that decided they wanted sushi on a Sunday evening.  Our waitress was patient with us from taking drink orders to explaining the contents of certain rolls to ensuring everything was OK. Of course we over ordered because our curiousity and eyes were bigger than our appetite but it was all very good.   I was a fan of the seating, decor and bar area and would recommend for any occasion!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night with the love to get some yummy sushi. He got the crab Rangoon (half off appetizers for happy hour!) and I got the grilled squid in curry sauce. They were super flavorful and creamy delicious. I got the spicy salmon roll and it was just what I was hoping for. Even the water with cucumber was good and not tap watery. Also props to our super chill server Beau who explained to us promptly happy hour deets and specials. Super fast service and cool mural :)"}
{"text":"It's not bad, but it isn't that great either. The positives: it's a beautiful restaurant, has this awesome indoor-outdoor thing going on, great decor. The quality of the fish is very good as well. Service was very friendly, although slacked a little on refilling our waters, but no biggie.  So what was just \"ok\" was the following - tuna rolls come without spicy mayo, it's healthier but also makes for a boring flavor overall. We ordered a spicy tuna roll, 'tuna overload' roll and the dinner sushi platter. It would have been nice if the waitress let us know it came with a tuna roll, because then we ended up getting two of the same rolls, in addition to the 'tuna overkill' roll. We also got some crunchy tuna sushi pieces and those were fantastic, pretty much the highlight of all that we ordered. So, it's good sushi quality wise but I just felt for the price there should have been a little more flavor or \"zazz\". Nice presentation of the food as well."}
{"text":"Located conveniently next to the ice rink, this sushi place worked as a pre dinner prelude. Honestly it is a sushi restaurant with all the usual suspects. Specialty rolls like Las Vegas or volcano roles, typical nigiri and edamame. It's not a bad option but doesn't stand out too much from other sushi places I've been to in Phoenix. If you want dinner and you're feeling sushi this place will work but I'd do somewhere else for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Do not like sushi but this is Only place I know where you can get an asian style burger! Their teriyaki chicken is also stellar. One setback watch for the flies they are evrey where. Also servers whole polite also seem a bit too rushed."}
{"text":"I don't really like sushi but the surf and turf sushi here is really good   and so are a lot of the other kinds, place is really nice and I would defiantly go again."}
{"text":"After a rough start where our reservation had been canceled due to a communication error, I had a wonderful time here.   I chose this restaurant for my birthday dinner based on the reviews I saw on Yelp and Google. Having realized the error, the manager and hostess did everything in their power to ensure that we had an amazing experience. The sushi was delicious and the drinks were spectacular. Overall, I will be glad to go back again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here last night. I love sushi but he's not a big fan. It was a compromise because they offered a lot of other options than sushi. I had my hopes up. The host greeted us and brought us to a table relatively quickly. The host came and greeted us and took our drink orders. We made our drink & dinner order. My boyfriend had a beer, I had green iced tea, 1 roll, 1 hand roll, 1 nigiri sushi, potsticker appetizer & 1 duck confit. The appetizer came out fine but it was mediocre and super doughy. Then my entire sushi order came out before his duck confit. Waiting another 10 minutes his order finally comes out. He tries it and it's cold. Really? Was his order just sitting there? We alerted the waiter and he said they would get another one out asap. I finish my green tea and the waiter refills with water. I told him I had green tea and my boyfriends asks for another beer. Another 15 minutes later his duck finally come out and it warm but not hot. But he's so hungry at this point he just wants to eat. My green tea was replaced but his beer is still empty. The waiter comes by and asks if there's anything else. My boyfriend says he's still waiting on his beer. I had a clear view of the bar and looks like his beer was just sitting there. The waiter forgot it was there. We finished dinner and I had 2 pieces left on my roll. I went for another piece and saw a short blonde hair (I have long black hair) laying on the roll. Gross!! I wanted to throw up. We alerted the waiter and all he says was \"oh\". Took the plate and took it off our bill. I was really surprised that the waiter didn't seem phased by an or things going on last night. Most people would be really apologetic and go out of their way to make it right. All we got was \"oh\". Does this happen a lot? Needless to say I'm not going back. I'm totally disgusted."}
{"text":"It's very rare to find a restaurant that hits ever nail on the head; ambiance, food, drinks, and service. Squid Ink is the exception to the rule.   Ambiance: the restaurant has a great, open layout. Bar is set up perfectly with big screen TVs. There is a very large outdoor patio with misters. The inside has a row of booths down the middle where you can take in the entire restaurant and see the open kitchen/sushi bar where the food is being made. A painting inspired a debate/conversation between me, my friend, and our server. It's the one by the hostess stand...is it Anna Kournikova?! We couldn't figure out who it was since the other paintings were obvious icons being of Muhammad Ali, Albert Einstein, and Marilyn Monroe. Anna doesn't fit that title. Curiosity is still getting me on that one.  Food: they have a pretty decent happy hour. They don't have that many rolls on happy hour; just a handful of basics like the California roll, spicy tuna roll, etc. that are $2 off. However, all of their appetizer starters are 1/2 price which is amazing! The cod appetizer is like butter and melts in your mouth! We also had edamame (can't really F that up), shrimp tempura roll (complimentary of our server because it was an extra made by the kitchen), the Rockstar roll (nice combination of spicy habanero pepper paired with the sweet chili sauce), and the Hawaiian bread pudding (pretty good other than the vanilla ice cream being mostly melted so it was a little soupy).   Drinks: I love that they serve their water with cucumber slices! So good and refreshing! Their wines are $2 off per glass for happy hour. They also had a handful of speciality cocktails and craft beers on draft on the list as well.  Service: our server, David, was perfection! Impeccable service, engaging conversation, and a complimentary sushi roll....it doesn't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"Ate here while visiting my brother for the holiday season, and will never be back if I'm in the area. The food itself was alright. I order fried rice and teriyaki chicken. My food was swimming in teriyaki sauce. That's personally not my thing but if you like heavy sauces you will love this. The three others in my party also said that their food was alright but nothing spectacular. Although the food was just alright I'm giving such a low rating because, about an hour after eating here I got very sick and was sick until the next morning. Being that I'm from Kentucky and only get to see my brother about once a year this really put a damper on the trip. While the rest of my family was spending time together I was laid up on the couch having phenergan and water for dinner."}
{"text":"Not a favorite. Too expensive for what you get. Tried their Crab Rangoon, was barely warm and a hefty $9.00 for 5 pieces. Also tried their fried chicken wings. No flavor whatsoever, bland and oily. Their drinks are also on the high price side as an Absolute and soda is $9.00. Cost me $31.00 for a nothing special lunch. Will not return and would rather spend that money at a local sports grill as their food is not worth the price."}
{"text":"Sushi was pretty good, but not the best I've ever had. Love the water with lemon and cucumbers!  Atmosphere is cool - sort of rock and roll trendy."}
{"text":"Flare, taste, and service all rolled into one  Tagged Squid Ink with a friend before a baseball game.  Very convenient location, event though the name threw me at first.    Sushi is very good for Arizona.  Plating style and service are both top-notch.  Staff was very attentive, took care of us quickly, and the bartender was fun to chat with.  Even got a discount on a Yelp check-in!  Very much enjoyed the Agedashi Tofu, Gyoza, Kale Salad, and Buffalo Roll."}
{"text":"We came in on a busy evening with 4 adults, 3 teenagers, a tween and a toddler.  There was a slight wait for a table to accommodate our group, but it wasn't too long and we were comfortable.  We were seated outside on the patio, with two of the tall propane deck heaters around us (one at each end of the table).    Everyone ordered various dishes, and we shared a little so that we could all try everything.  Nothing we had was disliked!  The Garlic Edamame was absolutely delicious!  Wish we had something like this at home, but we dont so its a good thing we tend to visit Phoenix and the surrounding areas semi-frequently."}
{"text":"We came during Happy Hour with a group of 8 and a toddler.  Sat outside among the awesome heater stands.  Food was great, especially the Garlic Edamame!  Drinks were yummy, and served right when they were asked for.    We were only visiting the area and dont have anything close to home that is similar so we will make sure to come back next time we are in the Peoria area!"}
{"text":"Note: I am not reviewing their sushi.   Potstickers are a must. The ramen and udon are delicious, but heads up the udon is not in broth. The beef short ribs are absolutely incredible with the kimchi and poached egg.   I'm salivating."}
{"text":"The place was empty. And Service was slow. I had to go the bar and ask for my beer.  The sushi rolls are small.  Must be hard to get fresh fish in the dessert.   I live in El Paso and we have fresh fish and better tasting rolls.  The white Tuna was still not completely thawed out.  I was disappointed.   My son ordered the ramen soup. It was bland and needed salt.    I would never visit this place again."}
{"text":"The customer service is great. The good is delicious and the atmosphere is cozy. Love it and would  ABSOLUTELY recommend"}
{"text":"Ok We are not the typical sushi eaters but we wanted a lighter meal so we figured let's go.   We got the couger roll and one with jalapeños and spicy tuna.  My husband is now a fan of sushi.   We also had some seaweed salad- very tasty.  The service was fantastic and our selection was based our servers recommendation after he found out what we wanted.   I would definately go here again and we appreciated how helpful everyone was."}
{"text":"I love this place and now have been there 4 times for lunch, dinner and happy hour.  Wait staff is helpful and friendly but there are some gaps of time on my visits where you say, where are they but I wouldn't let that affect my rating like some people have previously.  Food is great and they easily will make changes to your order, if you request.  No seaweed, no problem etc..    I seem to always eat inside because of bad weather or too cold on my previous visits but it looks like a nice outdoor area.  They do have live music inside on some nights, which is a nice touch but it is really hard to talk inside over the music since the place is all hard surfaces and not that big.  Maybe some softer kind of music could be played or somehow toned down?   I will be back with friends, who love the place too!"}
{"text":"Great food. Probably the best yakisoba I've ever had. I walked by earlier in the day and it was packed. Now I know why."}
{"text":"Squid Ink is a very trendy restaurant with a caring staff.  The restaurant is usually pretty busy but we've managed to only wait 10 minutes one time before being seated.  I typically order the coconut curry shrimp.  It is a bit spicy and has a lot of flavor...my favorite by far.  All of the dishes we have ordered have been great.  The dishes are all unique and have a very distinct flavor.  I can tell a lot of thought was put into making the dishes.  I love that!   My husband also enjoys the sushi.  He always comments on how much he gets with his orders.   The only downsides are that the restaurant is always very loud and I find it hard to hold a conversation without feeling the need to yell.  The music is often cracked up way too high.  I've asked a few times to have the music turned down and the staff does, which helps a little.  Also, the cool looking clear plastic seats may look trendy, but they sure are uncomfortable to sit in for more than 5 minutes. Be prepared to pay a little extra for your meal since this place can be a bit spendy."}
{"text":"I will make this review quick and easy. If you are a sushi lover and enjoy fresh high quality fish then DO NOT eat here. When the garlic edamame is the highlight of the meal, you know that you are in trouble."}
{"text":"I was in with co workers, noticed later that we were overcharged on our bill. I called the manager Tom explained the issue and left another message for him and no callback yet...Word of advice., review your bill before you pay."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar on a crowded Friday night (Viva Phoenix music event was happening and the entire cityscape area was packed). We still received good service fom the bartendress and really enjoyed our food. We ordered:   The spicey vegetable udon bowl - super yum! We especially enjoyed the tempora eggplant. The sauce on the noodles was spicey and a little sweet and just perfect. I am still thinking about this meal and can't wait to go back and order it again soon.  Three rolls - rainbow, dirty rockstar, and another one wrapped in cucumber. They were all fresh and tasty and accompanied by plenty of ginger.   My friend asked them to hold the sweet sauce on her roll, but we received it with the sweet sauce. It was crazy busy so we didn't really mind. The bartender went above and beyond and discounted our bill due to this mistake."}
{"text":"Always great food and service at Squid Ink. I really like the salmon bowl and sushi is consistently good. I also like the events they have regularly."}
{"text":"Happy hour menu is to die for. This place rules in every possible way. The service is amazing - the servers make sure you are well taken care of and sushi chefs artfully craft delicious roles while maintaining conversation which requires true skill.  I highly recommend trying the mussels and miso black cod!   Thank you Squid Ink for ensuring my money was well spent."}
{"text":"Squid ink here is not for eating, it's not on the menu... but it is for blinding people of quality.  Very cute place, love the design.  All show and no go describes this place well.    The restaurant was immaculate and well taking care of.  Super modern but dark as hell.  Smart move to truly prevent us from seeing the subpar quality of the food.  But daddy knows quality with taste and smell, not just sight alone.  The loo was super cool and super clean.  Service was slower than slow!  And the waiter was kinda odd and said it was super busy.  It was not even close to busy, not even close to their capacity.  If they consider that busy, the problem is definitely theirs.  Although he was slow and odd, he was friendly and polite.   The food was average, actually I'm gonna be real, it sucked!  Not worth the high price at all.  The eel was not fresh, and the tuna had a funky taste unlike anything I had ever ate.  Note I have eating plenty of fish in my life.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was Walmart grade tuna...The eggplant has no taste, the egg was cold, the banana looked like a \"wiener\".  A deep freaking fried wiener.  The water tasted like the sewer and the lemon couldn't save it.  A cucumber might have though.  The wonton soup, that puny thing was not worth no 5 dollars, what was that a kids meal soup?  And the avocado roll, was more avocado than rice... so imbalanced.  Might as well went to Trader Joe's and pick up a dozen all organic Avocados at that price.   Overall an approaching average experience, will not be back.  Lower your prices or bring up the quality.  That's my advice for this place.  On a positive note, the restroom was cool..... I squid inked it good in there... just kidding!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour here.  If you are in the area and want to try some sushi rolls and drinks this is the spot.  I enjoyed some Sushi and even went bold and tried the wings.  The waitress informed me they use imitation crab in most of it so I was fine with what I ordered.  I am allergic to shell fish so shrimp and crab are a no-no.  I did enjoy the imitation crab meat without ill effects.  So I guess I'm ok going here.  I was not impressed with the rolls however, not really good, not really bad?    I also did try the buffalo wings, but mine seemed overly salty, I did try to eat 3 and drank 2 glasses of water to accomplish that.  I can say I took them home, bathed them in barbecue sauce and that sweetness got rid of the salty.    I did like the cucumber slices in my water and the great outdoor seating.  On a nice day you can enjoy the weather and busyness of the location.    I would go again with an invite, but not on my radar for must eats in the future."}
{"text":"This place is so clean! Got to love how modern it is in this place. Sushi was really good too. Good place to enjoy yourself"}
{"text":"First of all this is a great place for the Decour.it is also a phenomenal place if you were looking for great pricing.my wife and I enjoyed a spicy tuna bowl .I enjoyed the Ramen which was perfectly cooked the noodles were not soggy at all or overcooked the pork belly was just amazing nice and tender. But most of all outstanding service I look forward to coming back as they are building an ice rink right in front of the downtown location"}
{"text":"This is the only location I've been to but I'd venture to the rest of them if I found myself across town and want something great. I've ordered the ramen each time I've gone to Squid Ink and they're always spot on.  I've only experienced lunch so am unsure of the drinks.  But I will say the staff at lunch is responsive and seem eager to please.  The space is clean and appropriate.  Music is light and just enough so as to not hear the people next to you.  A+ guys, I appreciate your efforts."}
{"text":"Tried it again after 6 months.  Again, terrible service, no refill, staff needs help from management.  They served the child last and brought all the food except hers - 10 minutes later it arrived.  Very Sad - big tips when children are happy.  Did I mention there were only 2 tables with people so it wasn't busy or understaffed.  It shouldn't take 1.5 hours for a lunch on Saturday when the place is dead."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Right in the center of downtown it's a great spot to grab dinner before doing a night out or some good sushi while staying at the Palomar Hotel."}
{"text":"Love the ambience and atmosphere. Service was a tad bit slow, but very friendly. We ordered Crab Ragoon, Potstickers, Curry Shrimp, Salmon Yakitori and Sushi. The food was excellent. Would like to see a bit more variation on the menu."}
{"text":"Ordered dragon roll, chicken and veggies, ramen, and short rib to go. Mediocre food, bland and tasteless. Bartender as rude. The only good thing about the restaurant was the nice hostess who took my order. Tipped her instead of the bartender."}
{"text":"I work downtown and went here for lunch last week. Great vibe and the sushi was amazing! Chef Nick sure does know how to roll!"}
{"text":"Modern atmosphere with great service and great sushi! House rolls are a definite recommendation!!!"}
{"text":"After driving around for 30 min trying to find parking and paying $20 to park, I was pretty stressed/angered. Then when I finally arrived to the restaurant one minute past the end of happy hour, the waiter would not honor the happy hour prices anymore. I was baffled at his lack of compassion.  If you come during happy hour, prices are reasonable. After happy hour, I cannot justify eating there.  However, I did end up eating there because I met up with a group of friends.  Food was ok but not very filling and service was terrible."}
{"text":"Checked out this place with some friends this weekend. My first thought when walking in was wow this place is fancy.  I wasn't disappointed.  The service was amazing. Even though we planned on staying for a while to conduct some business the wait staff was very attentive. Unlike many places in which the servers seem to disappear after bringing you your order, my water glass was never empty and they continued through the afternoon to ask if we needed anything else right up until the end.  I am not a sushi fanatic but I am learning to enjoy it more and more with each trip. That being said the sushi was so delicious.  I tried a spicy yellowtail roll which actually wasn't spicy at all and a squid nagiri.  The roll was great and so were the others I sampled.  I wasn't as impressed with the squid nagiri as it was a bit too chewy. Even though it's not sushi I would love to go back and try their Kobe burger."}
{"text":"Came into this place with high expectations, it had been recommended by friends and it's a famous Phoenix restaurant. We arrive and were \"greeted\" by a hostess who looked twelve and like she wanted to die, didn't even say hi. We had to ask for silverware, the server didn't come come to greet for about ten minutes - all this time we had no water, and they forgot one of our rolls. The food was ok but the atmosphere and energy was terrible. I couldn't wait to leave to not see miserable faces."}
{"text":"Went to eat last night after the oldies concert walked in stood waiting for someone to greet us for a few min with employees just standing around talking. When we finally got seated we were there for about 10-15 min and no one acknowledged we were there so we walked out. As we were already out the door the manager Tim was able to convince us to go back and let him make it a better experience for us. We went back in had the best customer service, Tim made sure we were happy with the all around visit to squid ink. By far the best sushi we have had in quite a few months. Thank you Tim for the outstanding customer service you provided and how you were able to convince us to go back in definitely well worth it! Absolutely will go back!"}
{"text":"This place was meant to be here! Hip, fun and never a dull moment around here. Just like the other two locations (cityscape & peoria) the energy is fun and active,  yet late night can keep it classy and elegant I could take a first date to impress, so long as joy or Nia are behind the bar. Sushi is always on point just like the other locations and I foresee this place to be a staple around the other restaurants on Scottsdale rd and Shea. Flying phoenix and Pokemon roll are my recommendations for sushi, the filet mignon and chicken wings for hot food. And of course the \"tune-in Tokyo\" for the specialty cocktail. With organic unfiltered apple juice making it an outstanding cocktail. This will be my new hangout for time to come"}
{"text":"Surprisingly fresh tasting (compared to other common places like Ra or Stingray) and the happy hour was pleasantly wide open. I tired the rainbow roll, spicy yellow tail and Pokémon roll which was amazing. My buddies ordered soft shell crab, spicy crab, garlic edamame and a Vegas roll. Needs less to say, it was all REALLY good, attentive staff and moderately priced. Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Great food with a good happy hour. Close to everything downtown Phoenix, nice ambiance and not overly pricey. Dirty Rockstar and Seafood Dynamite are my favorite rolls. Service has always been very quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of Squid Ink and they are always very friendly to kids.  The service is sometimes hit or miss.  Happy hour is a must!  Try the shishedo peppers"}
{"text":"I really like Squid Ink! The service is great with very nice people! The restaurant is very clean too! Even though I live 30mins away, it makes me want to come back! The prices are reasonable and the foods delicious!"}
{"text":"I normally don't review places that I am a regular at, it is not my policy. But I'm breaking my rule because we had an exceptional dinner at Squid the other night. Squid holds a special place in my heart because it was one of the first dates my now-husband took me to several years ago. We've been regulars ever since. Squid's located in the heart of downtown and has a pretty decent happy hour. The theme for our night that night was sweet chili sauce. We started off with the crab rangoons as appetizers and they were delicious- they had real crab in them and dipped in the sweet sauce, it was the perfect combination.  It was hard to choose, but I finally decided to order the Dirty Rockstar roll. The presentation was amazing! The red chili sauce seemed to go on forever, and with the jalepeno, it was a fusion of sweet and spicy that I absolutely loved!  For my cocktail, I even tried a pear-apple-flavored cocktail that reminded me of fall. It was amazing to have the flavors transport me back to the East Coast.  As always the fish is always fresh and the flavors are great. They are under new management as of a few months ago, and this is the first time we ate with the new management. Cheers to them - I love the direction they are going in."}
{"text":"Based on reviews a co-worker and I went here for lunch since it's close to work.  I love sushi and was excited to try it.  It was NOT good.  I got two sushi rolls and I tried a piece of my co-workers sashimi.  Ewww was my take on that mess.  There are other places around, skip this one."}
{"text":"Really great place.  Potstickers great.  Chicken wings fell off the bone.  Sushi outstanding.  Service was right on it as well.  Highly recommend stopping in. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"So like, ask for Asia at the bar. ;)  I'm not a Phoenix resident. So when I go out in other cities, I rely on the friends that take me to these places.  We had a birthday dinner to attend here on a Friday night. From what I am told this place is pretty new. We arrived at 8pm and sat at the bar waiting on the others. The bartender (Asia form here on out) took my drink order and suggested other liquid treasures. They have a well Vodka that is really good. I was surprised. Asia was amazing, great energy, knowledgeable and just a good character in general. Definitely sit and kick back a few with her. When all the guests arrived we were promptly sat. I ordered the butter fish with strawberry miso sauce. WOW. Literally melted in my mouth. Cooked PERFECT. It sat on top of some asparagus spears that were equally as tasty. I didn't have any sushi that night, but from what I saw and was told there was not one disappointment. My only con of the place was the layout. This has NOTHING to do with the staff, but everything to do with the interior decorator. The seating setup toward the wall is awkward, causing the servers to have to shimmy on by or tiptoe behind you.  The place still seems to be finding the right grooves within one another and are doing it well thus far. I would definitely recommend this place as a local or out of towner such as myself.   Try it...love it...Yelp it..."}
{"text":"Natalia was a great server! Definitely coming back!!! 5 stars!! Sushi was great but the service was above and beyond! Everyone come see Natalia and crystal!!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located near Palomar Hotel. We had Jeff as a server last Saturday night with our group and he was a great time. Very nice, cool, and down to earth. no problems which made our night even better. Thanks Jeff."}
{"text":"Never a complaint about this place. It's always been very enjoyable, excellent customer service and food. Plenty of options to choose from and overall very nice ambiance. You can dress up nice, or casual and you won't look out of place. We come here regularly."}
{"text":"Went here after a wedding. Got our order wrong and processed to skip over one of our diners meal twice. By the time they were going to bring the food everyone was done eating. All we got was a sorry. Not returning"}
{"text":"Went here a couple weeks ago for a snack before we popped into see a movie-rolls are really good if you like fancy, crazy, Americanized sushi-the dirty rockstar is delicious-a tin of fresh fish and spicy sauce. We also had the chicken skewers which were decent, and don't get the garlic edamame if you don't want to reek of garlic for 4 hours lol. My gripe about their vegetable roll is that their is a giant chunk of cream cheese in it? Really? Cream cheese in a veggie roll? It was good but a little much! I was trying to be healthy by ordering it and here it comes with a giant chunk of cream cheese cube in the middle with a deep fried asparagus spear. Not a healthy veggie roll. You should have a description of this roll since it's more like a special roll. Service was good and I like the decor. Don't sit in the booths in the middle if it's busy-you will almost be touching your neighbors :) can't wait to check out their happy hour!"}
{"text":"amazing atmosphere! love the music and vibe! kaci was amazing ! thank you squid ink!!!"}
{"text":"Very cool modern vibe here. Excellent sushi and the spicy vegetable udon bowl was terrific. Highly recommended. The location is a bit out of the way and coming from LA we did not know whatnot expect but these guys know their nigiri. My wife is vegetarian and really enjoyed the noodles as well as a sesame kale salad."}
{"text":"My coworker and I went there for happy hour yesterday.  Great location since we work downtown so it was walking distance.  The restaurant looked nice on the inside, very hipster.  I was super hungry and ready for some good sushi at great happy hour prices.  We ordered 4 sushi rolls (rainbow, spicy salmon, spicy tuna, yellowtail) and 2 sake.  The bill came out to be $50...which is already 1/2 priced for happy hour.     More bad news?  The sushi was the worst I've ever had.  They were pourly prepared and the chef took forever.  The rice was dry, fish tasted old and store bought (Fry's), not fresh.  Regular price would have been $100 for 2 people.  I would have been livid!    Oh yeah, and while we were there...at least 5 flies were flying around.  Good times."}
{"text":"Soooo delicious!!!! Was on the west coast and was just short of California Sushi! so we chose to stop at squid ink and we're soo happy we did! Amazing service, delicious sushi, and great drinks! Only downside is it is a little pricey, but the quality makes this worth the visit.   While here we've ordered the Flying Phoenix, Spicy Tuna roll, the sushi lunch platter, the seaweed salad, miso soup, and Hory Fook roll. ALL of which were wonderful! During a prior visit I also tried their wings and Kobe burger, the wings were fantastic ... Though I don't think I would order the burger again. It was not bad, but just not as good in comparison to the rest of their menu.   If you go here be sure to check-in and get 50% off your first draft beer. You will not be disappointed!  Just be prepared to pay at least around $25-$40 per person."}
{"text":"Overpriced sushi that is average at best. The wait staff is slow and often get orders in correct. Mostly younger staff who are too busy hanging out with each other rather than taking care of the customers. I took my family there, the waitress couldn't answer question about their soups, let my kids drinks go dry for over 20 mins and then got the  order wrong. The only reason it is open is because it's one of only two in the area. If Blue Fin ever gets out here, then place will be closed! Save you money, time and frustration by going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, fresh sushi, fun atmosphere, and friendly staff! One time we sat on the patio and listened to a really talented singer/guitarist. Always a good experience. Would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I wish I wrote this sooner but I had a extraordinary experience with Squid Ink  Review for service : I had to say this is the reason why I wanted to write the review. I believe the Owner ( Greg ) and Server ( Grayson ) have the best attitude among all the restaurants I've been to. It was a slow night due to local construction but Greg and Grayson served me well, and had me laughing and enjoying every bit of my time there by small talks and sharing stories.   Review for the food : Sushi and edamame are my favorite Japanese food and theirs, absolutely kept my appetite open. Although many on the menu I had never have, Grayson gave me a great intro of their best selling Sushi's. And I enjoyed what he recommended like no where else. It was a enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"The sushi here was great.  But, we weren't real crazy about the service.  It took a week to get our 1st drink.  Cool vibe, though.  We'll probably give 'em a chance to work out some kinks in service.  But, I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this new place! Everything about this location is perfect. The inside is beautiful; from the custom mural to the crystal jellyfish lights, this place has it all. The staff is very accommodating and professional, and the sushi is top notch. I've been to many sushi places around the valley and I have to say, very few can come even close to the quality that Squid Ink can boast. Last time I was there,  I got the Surf and Turf roll and it was one of the best rolls I have ever had.  This place has everything that a foodie would love!"}
{"text":"I love the art on wall, lighting of the place and the concept of it. Our waiter Joshua was awesome. Fot our drinks and food on time, very quick. :)  friend first time here, he got the chicken teriyaki, he wasn't sure about the sauce to it,  but he thought the chicken was excellent. He also got the dragon roll which he enjoyed, not so much on the California roll. He said it was bland and dry.  I had the vegetarian udon, I liked it... but the sauce was too sweet and there was too much of it on my plate. My non vegetarian las vegas roll was really good.  The last fifteen minutes of our dinner date, the music got really loud and it was hard to have a conversation.  Lolz."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service blows. Whenever I had a question about the food I was met with a sigh, rolling eyes and a sarcastic remark. I am very respectful and treat all people who work in customer service with respect, after my meal I didn't even want to leave a tip that's how much this dude pissed me off.   To Management: go over customer service with your staff otherwise your business will suffer."}
{"text":"Nice environment, good decor.  Dirty rockstar was phenomenal!  I would come back here again.  Comparable to Sapporo and Sushi Brokers in terms of sushi but quieter and a better indoor/outdoor environment."}
{"text":"These people were very nice about letting me and my buddy take a couple photos for a shoot! Also! The food is delicious and Billy was super nice and attentive. I will come back next time i do a photo shoot down there or go to a convention!"}
{"text":"Went here to listen to and support a friend (Lee Perreira - great musician) who played there for the first time.  The place is very modern and is located on a street corner in busy downtown.  The bar with outdoor seating is right on the sidewalk.  We sat at the bar and did have sushi (they have other dishes on the menu too).  We were served by a very smiling, alert, cute, attentive, pleasant young oriental girl (on our check it said that we were served by PM - you know who you are).  The service could not have been better and the food was good, but not good enough to deserve 5 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent, quality sushi. I am a big fan, but sometimes you come across a place that makes you a little unsure. Fear not sushi lovers! Squid Ink will not steer you wrong. In fact, they will most likely be able to help you decide on a delicious roll and make you laugh at the same time. The vibe of this restaurant is awesome, too. It's new and modern with a sweet mural of a woman with octopus hair that I could not take my eyes off of. Loved it! Honestly, everything was wonderful and I can't wait to go back! Who's down for a sushi night? I know what I'm ordering!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot in the area! The atmosphere, dishes, and staff are all superb. Our server was very attentive and made us feel really comfortable. The manager Adam took the time to make sure or meal was going well which we really appreciated. I will definitely be coming back and telling my friends to check it out!"}
{"text":"Our bartender was fun, accommodating, and knowledgeable.  Drinks and sashimi were on point.  Menu is very creative without going overboard.  And it's right up the street from my house! Love."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. The Ultimate Philly roll was great, but the Beef Yakisoba bowl blew me away. The steak was perfectly cooked, and all of the flavors together made me a return customer. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Tasty sushi for sure. Came here for dinner on a Friday night and everything we tried was good. The tuna and salmon were great, the garlic edamame was wonderful.  Rolls were creative and like I said very tasty. The staff was good but some of the seating is kinda tight. Not a big deal but one of my table members kept getting kicked in the chair leg a few times."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Food was fresh, service was great. Had sushi all over the world and I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Had the beef yakisoba to go. I must say, for a dish like this \"to-go\" it was great. Lots of flavor, the beef was cooked perfect and tender.  A big plus for me was the vegetables were not mushy, steamed just right."}
{"text":"Great everything, from sushi to wings to drinks. Outside bar is cool. Great happy hour prices! Right across from Dbacks & Suns venues."}
{"text":"First time here and it was not a good experience. Venue is nice, atmosphere was nice, but the food came up short.  We checked in, ordered their Seafood Dynamite Roll, Vegas Roll, Buffalo Chicken Roll and the Ultimate Philly roll. Of the 4, the Philly roll was the best... the Buffalo Chicken Roll was 2 thin fried chicken tenders wrapped in almost an inch of rice topped with Buffalo sauce and technically not sushi... the Vegas Roll, salmon with some cream cheese double wrapped in rice and deep fried... there was very little sushi and the salmon had a very unpleasant taste, we didn't finish this roll. Lastly the Seafood Dynamite Roll had spicy crab rolls on the bottom layer topped with a \"slab\" of what seemed like a cooked purée of different seafood items. This Roll had a very fishy taste and we ate 3 of the 8 rolls before we left it alone... we gave feedback to our waitress, who was very pleasant, attentive and provided us excellent service even though the food wasn't great... when it was time for the bill, the waitress informed us that the Seafood Dynamite Roll was going to be removed from our bill, but it was still there even after she ran our cards... at no time did the manager come to ask us about our experience even after she helped the waitress correct our bill...   We contemplated writing a review, but in the end agreed that we should provide our feedback.   We have sushi night once every other week but most likely will not be coming back to this venue."}
{"text":"The name of this place is deceiving lol. There is absolutely no squid ink here but there is broiled squid?   Came right in time for happy hour and got sake bombs all around.   Sushi was pretty well priced. Not too expensive or cheap. Great quality. Our server was so nice and the restaurant was beautiful. Don't think I'll come again but it was a an average sushi spot."}
{"text":"Amy was our server and she made everything exceptional. Food was good, the price of everything was more than fair and the portions were surprising large."}
{"text":"I have been to Squid Ink a few times now, and every time I can say I enjoy their service! I don't eat fish, but I do enjoy the teryaki chicken bowl! I love sitting and talking with friends watching the people of CityScape go by! However, I think the pricing is a little ridiculous. $11 for a small bowl? Crazy."}
{"text":"I'd heard about Squid Ink, but never got the opportunity to try it because of its location (whoever invented one-way streets needs dive into a never-ending well, immediately).   Unfortunately, this place is overrated, expensive and just overall a shame. Everything was so confusing and clammy, literally. Not sure whether they decided to lay off the A/C but it was so humid, warm and sticky inside that I didn't even feel safe eating the sushi. All 8 of us were sweating as we ate inside, fanning ourselves with the drink menus. The irony of it all was that it was raining heavily outside and we seemed to fare better out there afterward.   The agedashi tofu was a mysterious mess. The breading was soft and wouldn't break apart easily when you chewed on it, while the sauce that accompanied it was an overly heavy pile of slimy goop. Instead of the usual light dashi broth you expect with tofu, they covered it up with what tasted and looked like a mix between orange chicken sauce and sweet and sour. If fast food offered tofu, this is what I would expect it to be like I guess.   So, I moved onto Plan B which was to then drown my sorrows as I was going to party with most likely an empty stomach for the rest of the night. I ordered a cocktail but as it turns out, I just ordered world's most expensive Caprisun because there was barely any trace amount of alcohol.   When you're downtown, your dining options are still pretty limited at dinner times though we're making great strides. But, what do you do if before or after a ball game/concert, you get a sudden, voracious hankering for sushi? For now, unless you have a reservation at Nobuo, take an Uber and get the heck out of downtown. The illusion this place brings just because it's located at a hotspot is definitely deceiving."}
{"text":"AWESOME. Great rolls, perfect service (attentive, but not hovering), and a great atmosphere. They were totally happy to customize a roll for me without hassle. Squid Ink rocks! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"First time here. The staff had all the answers.  Great patio, dog friendly, with a wonderful happy hour menu. Will be coming back"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. To begin with, sushi was sub par. $13 appetizer not great. Literally pulled an4\" hair out of my teeth on my 4th piece of sushi. My wife and I immediately stopped eating, obviously. I had to go to the bathroom and lost what little dinner I had eaten. I inform the waitress and ask for the bill. $58, no discount, charges in full for the sushi. I informed the waitress to get me a manager and there was no way I was paying for the sushi at least. She asks me what roll had the hair. I tell her that's moot considering there was no possible way we were finishing any more of the food sitting on the table. Manager takes the sushi off my bill. Still $26 for an appetizer and saki bomb."}
{"text":"I came here on a wednesday night at 7pm and the place looked packed full like it was the weekend. The host told us that there will be a 15 minute wait because they only have two waitresses working. We asked to sit at the sushi bar which had a lot of seats open but some reason she said there's a wait to sit here too. Anyway, we went to an urban outfitters across the street to kill some time.  Prior to arriving I looked through the photos on yelp and was very impressed with the interior design and also the sushi rolls looked very tasty! It is actually a lot smaller than I thought but it still looks very nice inside.  The menu seemed to not have much sushi selection. There are only 15 specialty rolls to choose from which I was surprised of a small selection. I ordered the seafood dynamite, hory fook, eel and salmon nigiri. I was really excited for the dynamite roll for the scallops from the photos on yelp but mine did not come out to how I expected. There was only a full piece of cooked kinda dry salmon on top of the spicy crab and cucumber rolls with eel sauce all over it which you had to use your chopsticks to break off the fish for each piece (not really sanitary to share) and no scallops to be found. I was with an old friend so I was more focused on catching up than my orders. The hory fook was okay nothing special, the tempura jalapeños was spicy if you like that. I actually ended up liking the salmon and eel nigiri more than the house rolls. The salmon was very good and fresh.   I usually never have a problem being happy with my order if I see it in photos before the order but I wouldn't order the two house rolls again. I live in the west valley so this location was out of the way. Ill probably try it again since it may have been the rolls i got but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner here tonight and average is all I can say. Our waitress was really sweet and attentive (of course I didn't catch her name) but otherwise we weren't impressed. The dirty martini I ordered was basically all vodka. When I asked for more olive juice it came back too dirty (Its always hard to get a perfect dirty, I don't know why) Sushi was average. Our bill was $70. Seemed way too expensive for the experience and quality, in my opinion. I don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"Overly priced food... check! I ordered the kobe burger, and yes I know it's a sushi restaurant but I was craving it. Not only did the waitress had to come and inform me, 20 minutes since I ordered , that there was a missing ingredient and I had to wait while someone went to get it;   my burger at best was mediocre. Already knowing it wasn't authentic kobe, I expected the burger to at least taste good. My burger came out with a soggy bottom bun and that didn't deter me. The one thing that made me upset was the bacon inside. It was hard and was similar to beef jerky. My first take on it was horrendous but I kept up the front of a satisfied customer because my waitress was extremely friendly. My sister ordered the beef short ribs and the presentation looked like it was sloppily thrown together last minute. The meat was described to me as dry and tasteless. The only good thing about the dish was when the waitress asked her if she wanted siracha, something my sister gladly took. My other companions liked their sushi but I recommend those who order something besides sushi to run to another place to satisfy your hunger."}
{"text":"Besides the waitress not knowing what's on the menu and not telling us that they up charge for fresh wasbi which is $3 plus not knowing what udon is and how it's normally served as well as the miso soup being salty, the dinner sashimi platter had thick slices of fish, the edamame was a large portion size, the draft sake was cold, and the tofu was tasty. Thanks to the manager who rectified the added charges and handled the inconveniences of dinner."}
{"text":"Although normally I'd have sushi, we opted with ramen and curry. While the curry was phenomenal, the ramen was rather dull but did have plenty included. The atmosphere and service is great and I really liked the music. The prices are OK but understandable for the location and ambience. The place is beautifully designed. I work in the area and would probably come back for lunch once every month or 2."}
{"text":"Outdoor Bar seating is most desired in this great downtown location but it fails to get the most optimal service. As in we were barely acknowledged by bartender. Doesn't even matter if the food was ok and if we even wanted drinks because our bartender wasn't really even tending to us. This isn't the first time I've had this experience at the bar but it'll probably be the last."}
{"text":"Surf N Turf and Hory Fook are awesome. Pokémon roll was really bad, you don't want to catch em all."}
{"text":"playlist on Friday night. Heard there was DJ there on Saturday can't wait to check it out. Service was very friendly, food came fast and was tasty. Great date night spot."}
{"text":"First two times I went, I loved it and was very excited. Whenever new places open downtown, I feel such pride. Unfortunately, it's been less than impressive my past few trips (I know. I should stop trying.) The sushi wasn't great, my table was dirty and so were the ones around me, and the service was slow. If you're just going for a drink and edamame, this place fits the bill. Anything more and I suggest you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. So bad my 3 yr old will not let us go back. Let me explain. Friday night with my kids by myself and decided to give it a try as we just moved pretty close. Both my kids are good going to restaurants and really good eaters. Wait wasn't terrible to get a table but then we waited for a server until I asked one of the waitresses walking by. She told me she was pretty bored so she would just take care of us. I was ready to order right then, I had ordered 2 rolls, miso, edamame and 2 of the kids plates. A little while goes by and my rolls are the first thing out. I have never been to any sushi restaurant where the soup and edamame don't come out in a couple mintues so was pretty shocked by this. Waited for the server who was \"bored\" to make an appearance and let her know that we hadn't gotten any of the rest of our order yet. I was told the kitchen was really behind but she would check on it.  Miso and edamame finally come out and my daughter needs to use the bathroom. My kids are 3 and 1 so I couldn't send her by herself or leave the other one at the table. Grabbed my purse both kids and told our waitress we were going to the bathroom. When we got back my barely touched rolls were gone and they were finally delivering the kids plates.  Let my waitress know that they took our food and she was going to have replacements made. All was good until daughter needed to go to the bathroom again. Once again told our waitress we were going to the restroom and would be right back. Upon return our entire table was being cleared off. So now I have a toddler in tears and nowhere to eat. Waitress was nowhere in sight so approached the hostess stand and was told that their bussers are just that good. I couldn't believe the response, no sorry, can we make anything to go, nothing just a blank stare. The little food we did taste was good but sadly we will never be back"}
{"text":"Place is a joke! Went in today for lunch......since they serve lunch expecting to get in and out in a lunch hour. I was told sushi was taking 40 minutes to prepare its raw fish and rice  (staff up it's Lent big demand for fish). So I was told order off the menu since the kitchen is faster. I ask if they served brown rice. I was told \"yes\" okay I will give this another shot.....only to be told minutes later we are out brown rice. Are you serious I thought  I entered a Sushi Restaurant - that also serves various rice dishes."}
{"text":"Great sushi.  The west side doesn't have a lot of places like this, so it's very cool. Similar to Ra Sushi, it has a bit of a \"hip\" feel to it.  Like the Scottsdale sushi places, it's expensive.  Also, althought the buidling is very new, it is smaller so be prepared for a wait if you come on a weekend night.  One lovely thing about the west side even in classier places like this, our waitress has metal shit through her face and tattoos all over.  Brings the class level down a few notches.  Still, the sushi was amazing.  One creative thing we had on the menu was buffalo chicken sushi.  Had wing sauce, chicken and ranch wrapped in rice.  Very good.  I've heard they have music on Thursday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"The BF and I went to the grand opening last night and I was pretty impressed. This restaurant/bar has a nice modern vibe and an extensive menu of hot items and sushi. We sat on the patio where the misters were out of control (read: it felt like it was a rainy day and we were just barely under an awning....not that this was a bad thing). We ended up sharing a few items including: Cucumber rolls (pretty standard), buffalo chicken roll (this was ridiculously good...the buffalo sauce was spicy and delicious, the chicken was crunchy, it was a definite winner), and the kobe burger with Tokyo fries (the burger was good, it had caramelized onions and spicy aioli on it and came on some kind of flatbread....definitely tasty...they cooked it a little over what we ordered it at, but it was still tasty. Additionally, they forgot to give us the fries, but when I told our waiter he got them for us, so no problem there. The fries were good, nice and crispy and they had been fried in fish oil so they had a slight fish taste to them....but in a good way).  We also had a few drinks, that were all tasty. I had the deep water, which tasted like a jolly rancher, but not in that weird synthetic way some drinks like that may taste, but in a fresh way. It was very good. I also tried the revolver which had a delicious ginger flavor. The BF had whiskey sours which were on special for only 3$ (awesome!) and they were also tasty. Overall, there were a few snags, but it was good. I will definitely try them again."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever written a Yelp review but this gross sushi place definitely got my family and me sick so I figured I'd give them a shoutout  keep up the bad work!"}
{"text":"yum! I came here for lunch a bit worried because it didn't think it was open so to construction out front. I'm so happy I pursued going. the modern interior was clean the staff were attentive and pleasant and made suggestions for my choice torn between the Ramen noodle bowl or spicy tuna lunch rice bowl I took the Ramen noodles. out of this world good I got the pork belly. the waitress was so easy to speak with and really made the right choice for me. big portions as well. I got the spicy tuna to go for later. couldn't finish it all took the rest of the pork Ramen with me."}
{"text":"First time to Squid Ink ~ overall great food & wine.  We sat @ the bar for dinner & happy hour just last Friday.  We will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Squid Ink was surprisingly good.  3 of us went on a Saturday night for a later dinner.  We had sushi in mind and stuck to that, although the rest of the menu looked promising.  Our server told about a seared duck breast special that was kind of a head scratcher.  Nonetheless, it was a hip setting, staff was very friendly, the fish was fresh, and we were in every way satisfied.  The Tahoe roll flavor wise is superb.  The sushi chef was not a technical wizard but I wasn't expecting Jiro or anything.  The scaffolding/construction zone situation seemed to really hurt the outside seating area's potential.  We sat inside as a result.  I hope that gets resolved soon, this is an awesome time of year to enjoy the AZ weather.   Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Love it here!!! Sexy staff! Sexy sushi!!! Lisa is a phenomenal bartender!!! Nick is the best sushi chef!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were staying at a downtown hotel for NYE and planned to grab some food and beers at the hotel before hitting up our final destination. Lucky for us, the hotel wasnt offering their usual happy hour deal so we were in a scramble to find a new spot with good food and drinks - Squid Ink to the rescue! Not only did they have a happy hour on NYE, but they have amazing food and great local craft beer on tap. Couldnt have been happier when we go there - great place with amazing staff. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were so attentive and friendly, even offering to ring up our final beers before happy hour ended and bringing them to us when we were ready. Loved the food - the crab rangoon had huge chunks of crab in it, the wings were great, and the miso black cod dish? Probably the best thing I've eaten in months. Ridiculous - and for half price happy hour! Absolutely loved this place, cant wait to go back and meet up for happy hour again with my friends soon."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this cute little spot in Scottsdale. Very nice modern decor, misters on patio (we sat inside) looked like a great place for happy hour, and I see in the other reviews it is. Want to come back and try out their cocktails and appetizers sometime.  Yeah, good sushi in Scottsdale, Arizona!  The service was efficient, friendly and helpful- thanks to our server, Hunter. I let her know I only had an hour, tops, for lunch and she promised to make sure we were taken care of. We were.  To start, we had the Crab Rangoons so good. Not greasy at all, and piping hot. Loved the hot, sweet chili dip.  I had Flying Phoenix, upon Hunter's recommendation. It was very good. Black pepper- crusted tuna tataki, avo, shrimp, spicy crab with a black-pepper sauce. Good sized roll, unique with that black pepper going on, and very filling.  Companion was happy with her roll as well, I tried it and it was very delectable. Hory Fook was the name, and had shrimp tempura, avo, spicy tuna. Loved the slice of fresh jalapeno on top, and the aoili gave it a nice kick too, but not too spicy.  We were in and out of there in time, the bill was only $38.00 to get a Sushi fix in the desert. Next time, I'd like to spend a little more time dining there."}
{"text":"Squid Ink is where IT is at. Ramen-wise they are the superlative. I've had other dishes and they've also been downright tasty. But I crave the ramen... I NEED the ramen. The broth is complex. Add some sriracha and it gets more complex. Open the soft boiled egg to let the yolk mix and you're seriously golden. The levels in this dish are indeterminable, at least to my palate, and they are oh so varied.   Let's talk about the location now. NE corner of Central and Jefferson. Critics will say what they will about the Cityscape development, but this spot they nailed. Most of the restaurant looks out onto the street so you've got the train passing by regularly. Kiddy-corner you'll find the Luhrs Buidling - one of the best structures to look at in the downtown core. Long story short, Squid Ink has one of THE most prime locations.   The murals inside... shut your hole if you dislike them in any way. They create exactly what I want in an establishment: character. The interior is spot-on, from the booths/tables to the liquor bar and the sushi bar.   Yes, parking can be tricky. Cityscape has a garage with multiple entry points but I can't confirm if Squid Ink validates. But it has multiple levels of parking either way. For anyone that doesn't live downtown, perhaps it's time to reconsider your geography.   Summary - YES!"}
{"text":"This place has a fun and cool vibe to it.  It's very clean and awesome customer service.  The cougar roll is fan freaking tastic!  I love that they have a great happy hour and such a variety.  You can have anything from chicken wings to sushi and they all taste great.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Went there with my wife with high hopes. Been to one downtown and it was very good. I love the feel of this place, cool bar attractive waitresses and servers. The bar has a young hip vibe which is cool. We sat inside instead of the patio which looked nice. Our waitress was great and attentive and fast with our drinks and food came out quickly. We were there for Happy Hour so the prices were reasonable. The problem is the sushi. We ordered the Hory Fook  which was just ok and sort of bland. 2 shrimp tempura rolls that had no tempura on them and a blah California roll. The appetizer we ordered was the potato firites which was pretty good. Below average sushi so we were disappointed. It was our first time so I might give it another chance. It was out of our way but thought we would give it a try we are always looking for new sushi places to add to our rotation. Kabuki at Westgate or Hayashi in Surprise blow this place away. This place needs new sushi chefs, everything else is great about it."}
{"text":"the sushi was so bad I wanted to spit it out after I put it in my mouth. I ordered the  dumpling wonton soup, which was average, seaweed salad which was average, and then 5 pieces of sashimi (yellow tail, toro, squid, I forget the other 2) All were absolutely awful. I also ordered the caterpillar roll, which consisted of imitation crab and eel for $12. Horribly overpriced for imitation crab. Also, two of my coworkers ate there the same night and 1 of them got very bad food poisoning and the other felt sick the entire next day. I also felt very sick to my stomach the next day. I should have followed my taste buds and spit out the sushi. I was choking it down because I felt rude if I spit it out.  I live in Chicago so I'm used to decent sushi. Maybe this place had 4 stars because there isn't any good sushi in Phoenix or maybe people are ordering items other than the sushi. I will not be returning to this restaurant and highly recommend that you avoid it as well."}
{"text":"If it could give zero stars, I would. We got there at 10pm. It took them 15 minutes to come to our table. The waiter forgot about our drinks and by the time we reminded him, they were lukewarm. By 10:40pm, we had not received our sushi rolls. There were tables that came significantly after us that had already gotten their food. We asked them to do our check since our rolls hadn't come out. As soon as we were paying which was at 10:45pm, sushi rolls were brought out by the hostess, and we told her we didn't want them anymore. She gave us attitude as if we were the ones at fault for two sushi rolls taking nearly half an hour to come out. Horrible service and I will not be coming back again."}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant place to go to . Im not a fan of sushi at all , but this place was really good! I had their quid and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Good job squid ink the one meal that is the most important is my sons and you completely forgot about it. Anyone in a serving position knows get the kids food out first so we dont have meltdowns. And this is also after waking him up so he could eat. Well after about 5 min of us getting our food My bf gets up and asked our server where our 2 years old food is and he said it would be right out. Pretty sad we had to go find our server to ask. Another 10ish minutes goes by we are done eating and no food for our son in sight. I am beyond livid. We had horrible service never checked on drinks empty and the \"discount\" we got was them taking our sons food off our bill that wasn't even on there. Our server was to busy chatting it up at the bar entertaining his customers and completely forgot about us and the other 2 tables of people.  Thank god my son is well behaved when we go out to eat and he ate my cold miso soup. The only positive was the potstickers shrimp tempura roll and cougar roll were delicious."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good sushi!! Best I've had!! Nothing bad in this entire place!! Try the Green Tea drink!! Chef Nick and Lisa are the best!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in last night for a date night with my husband. We happened to get there during happy hour which was good because if we had paid full price for the food this review would probably be a zero. I have to start by saying this review is so low because of the quality of the food, it is has nothing to do with the servers. They were okay (although I did have to flag a different person to get us more water.)  We ordered a variety of nigiri, sushi rolls, and appetizers. We had the salmon nigiri (raw fish on top of rice), tuna nigiri, California roll, spicy tuna roll, rainbow roll, pot stickers, and the Japanese fried chicken. The sushi honestly was NOT very good. The rice was hard and the sushi was very bland. Maybe they leave off the wasabi for \"Americans,\" but if sushi has been prepared correctly it should have flavor and should not need to have wasabi added. Having lived in Japan for 4 years maybe I am more finicky than most but this sushi was honestly worse than some I have gotten at a grocery store that I paid significantly less for. As for the appetizers we got, the first order of pot stickers was good (maybe a little on the luke warm side), but much better than the second order we received which had the entire outside a dark golden brown and crunchy. (Obviously cooked too long). The Japanese fried chicken, how to start. First off sending out chicken chunks with kimchi is NOT Japanese fried chicken. Japanese fried chicken would be tonkatsu, not this horrible Americanize chicken chunks with a KOREAN side. Seriously get your Asian condiments correct. Next we actually had to send the chicken back to the kitchen and tell them to forget it. It was hard, cold, and DRY. So dry in fact I had to drink water to swallow the bite I took. For a place this pricey you would expect MUCH better food. You could tell the place is popular as it was packed. Maybe we just got a crappy kitchen staff on our visit, but we won't be wasting our time or money back at this place.  There are much better options around, some even just across the street."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food taste / quality and the bartender that ended up serving us. negative 2 stars for everyone else.  we arrived an hour before the sold out Adele show on a Monday night. the hostesses explained that there was a 30 minute wait for two and then one of the hostesses clearly said that the bar and high tops behind the bar were open seating. we grabbed the first high top we saw open only to be immediately kicked out by the same hostesses (the one who had told us they were open seating played dumb when I said \"I thought you said the high tops and bar were open seating\"). Minus 1 star.  We were eventually seated by the hostesses at said high tops (after waiting a little bit). 15 minutes went by and no one came to our table to serve us. I asked the bartender if there was a server for our table. She said yes and we saw her alert the server, a manager and a hostess about the problem. Another five minutes went by and still no one showed up to take our order.  Around then, two seats opened up at the bar, and, having no more time to spare, we moved ourselves into them. From that point on our experience was delightful. The baritender was attentive and the food was delicious.  You would think they would be used to being really busy before events at the arena, but apparently they are not. Aim for the bar during busy times."}
{"text":"First off, good service. Waitress was very friendly and honest. Anyways, I wanted some ramen this evening. Strolled in to find that today there was some ramen with chicken in it. Okay, I'm fine with that... I like different things. Ramen came out, and it was EXTREMELY underwhelming. The broth had a hint of miso (or whatever the base was), and what tasted like tap water. They added some red chili paste to it for a kick to offset how bland this tasted overall. Noodles are naturally bland, and really need a decent broth to make them glorious, so obviously bland + bland = bland. In short, don't serve ramen here. You aren't good at it, and if you want to start somewhere, try a nice tonkotsu ramen, and improve on it. Of course, I'm comparing this to California's offerings like: Foo Foo Tei, Shinsengumi, Daikokuya, Yukinoya, etc, and this doesn't register as moderately good, fair, or even poor. It's bad.  I gave you an extra star, because while the food was meh, I left feeling okay, due in part to the peppy waitress who was serving me."}
{"text":"Definitely a place with a unique atmosphere and food/drink offerings! I enjoyed the buffalo chicken \"sushi\" more than I thought I would (a great alternative for non-fish people), and the usual go-to sushi rolls were tasty. Service was grea,t and everything seemed fresh. I liked the variety of happy hour foods (including appetizers) and would happily go back for HH again.   The only semi-negative comment I have is that the drink menu (specialty drinks) could be more detailed/descriptive. I ordered their version of a mule (Revolver) and was unaware that \"seasonal fruit\" meant \"strawberries.\" Due to an allergy, I had to send the drink right back, but they were kind enough to replace it with another drink (Shiso Happens) which was unique and more savory than sweet."}
{"text":"Squid Ink was surprisingly good.  4 of us went on a Saturday night for a later dinner.  We had sushi in mind and stuck to that, although the rest of the menu looked promising.  Our server told about a seared duck breast special that was kind of a head scratcher.  Nonetheless, it was a hip setting, staff was very friendly, the fish was fresh, and we were in every way satisfied.  The Tahoe roll flavor wise is superb as well as the Buffalo Chicken and Surf and Turf Roll!  We got to sit outside and enjoy the gorgeous weather outside.  Very friendly staff and looking forward to coming here again!"}
{"text":"This place is really only worth coming during happy hour. The sushi is really nothing special so don't waste your time coming here during regular hours. The only thing that was different and unique about this place was their green bean tempura which was a completely new concept that I had never heard of. Their green bean tempura is definitely worth. They're long, crispy, and have a hint of natural sweetness on the inside. Surprisingly, it compliments the fried tempura on the outside very well. It also comes in a decently sized portion for the price. I would recommend this place if you're in the area and craving sushi but definitely only come during happy hour!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place, and the reason why we ended up here, is that they stay open really late!  They stay open until 2 am on the weekends.    The sushi itself is what you'd typically expect at a sushi restaurant.  I did note that none of their specialty rolls sounded particularly appetizing to me because they all contained something fried.  So I stuck to the rainbow roll and tuna roll.  Both were good, although the fish was not AS fresh as I would have liked.  Additionally, the tuna roll was made kind of messily and was falling apart at the ends a bit.  The favorite part of the meal was the marinated squid salad - delicious!  I would come here again if I had another late night craving for sushi!  p.s. - they validate for parking if you park in the garage directly adjacent"}
{"text":"So as you know I'm an avid sushi lover. Nothing says hiiiyah origato like sushi and sake bombs. It was fairly crowded as we walked on and they had no seats even tho they let us sit at the bar or the community table, we chose the bar. Let me tell you the seafood dynamite roll is fucking amazing. It was like every beautiful Japanese a geisha girl sat on  my tongue.  We them ordered the sake bombs and let me tell ya, it was like Hiroshima and Nagasaki in my mouth. I love this place."}
{"text":"I stopped in here today and have a sushi lunch special. It came with some very good me so soon California roll a full one  the six pieces and four different types of sashimi  it was pretty good fresh not quite excellent because this sashimi was sliced really thick I would've been better a little bit more on the thin side. The waitress was a little slow it wasn't that much of a big deal for me because I wasn't in a hurry. I also ordered some rice putting they made with sticky rice but did like a crème brûlée it was OK not good way to sweet."}
{"text":"Their happy hour lasts til 7:00pm. Such a good deal! They have delicious rolls on the happy hour menu and all of the starters are included in the HH menu as well. I love just ordering everything and sharing with my friends. My favorite rolls to order here are the Flying Phoenix, Tsunami, and Dirty Rockstar. The Flying Phoenix is the only one on Happy Hour. They have other sushi rolls on happy hour too."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance here. Lights are dim and there's always good music. I ordered the surf n turf roll which was pretty good. My uncle always orders the Pokémon roll when he comes because it's delicious and my aunt loved the salmon."}
{"text":"Squid Ink:  It's rich in iron and antioxidants and provides a number of potential health benefits!    Too bad I didn't see any squid ink dishes here.  :(  Upon first glance, this place was great.  It was sleek, the tentacle artwork was interesting, and the layout was a bit cramped but efficient.  When asking for a table, our host warned us that they were short staffed and busy.  Way to try and drive business away.  After getting our table, we looked around to a half full restaurant at best but boy was service lacking.  We could never find our waiter!  Anyways, for starters, I got the table some Shishito Peppers [sea salt | bonito | tiger sauce, $10] and two of my dinner companions got the Wonton Dumpling Soup [miso broth | pork dumplings | scallion, $5].  The shishito peppers were pretty decent.  The bonito flakes gave the peppers a nice umami taste and the tiger sauce was light.  The peppers itself had a nice heat to them.  They say 1 out of 10 shishitos are spicy.  I'm glad our plate was more like 7 out of 10 are spicy.  The wonton soup was a dud though.  Just imagine eating a bowl of miso soup with two gyozas swimming in it.  There you have it.  For our main entrees, we got a various assortment of items.  Here are my thoughts:  SPICY TUNA [maguro | avocado | tempura eggplant | asparagus | sesame seeds | ponzu | sushi rice, $14]:  This was ordered by Jannette L. with the addition of a poached egg.  I'm not a fan of spicy tuna so I didn't give it much thought when she ordered it.  I don't recall any maguro or asparagus now that I'm re-reading the description.  Anyways, it wasn't anything to go crazy over and I wouldn't order it again.  It was pretty bland with exception of the slow steady heat from the spicy tuna.  The tempura eggplant needed some flavor and was more reminiscent of biting into a fried sponge.  COCONUT CURRY SHRIMP [tiger shrimp | broccoli | carrot | onion | mushrooms | yellow curry | basil | rice, $16]:  This was pretty delicious although a tad too salty.  Tran D. had ordered this and she seemed to enjoy it immensely.  CITRUS YELLOWTAIL [yellowtail | avocado | grapefruit | cilantro | ponzu, $13]:  Probably my most favorite bite of the night.  Fresh sweet yellowtail with an explosion of citrus flavor from the sauce and the creaminess from the avocado... yum!  The BLVD [white fish | king crab | avocado | cucumber wrap | yuzu vinaigrette, $15]:  My second favorite bite of the night.  The cucumber was fresh and the white fish was tasty.  But at $15 for five bites?  Yeowch.   EEL CUCUMBER, $9:  I didn't try this but I heard it was standard by Simon W.'s opinion.  AVOCADO ROLL, $6:  I ordered this to accompany my BLVD roll.  Hey, I need more than two bites for dinner, okay?  The avocado roll was mainly avocado with the thinnest layer of rice.  A bit uneven if you want something with more rice but I love avocados so I wasn't mad.  It's definitely unbalanced though.   Dessert was a BANANA KATSU [vanilla bean ice cream | palm sugar | coconut milk, $8] shared between us four.  I was expecting the coating to be panko and not tempura but alas, it was a tempura battered banana.  Nothing thrilling and for $8?  Eeks.  Squid Ink may look pretty but they serve a pretty mediocre meal.  I think this is a one-and-done kinda place for us."}
{"text":"Expecting something great...got something bad. My steak/beef looked nothing like some of the bowls posted looked. Small rolls/pieces...Big prices. Much better out there."}
{"text":"Best sushi happy hour around. We love squid ink and have been going at least once a week. I went in one time and they were playing trap music. BLEW MY MIND! That alone locked in a customer for life. Kudos Squid Ink!"}
{"text":"Squid Ink is a fantastic addition to the downtown restaurant scene. I have been a number of times for lunch and drinks at night. Everyone is extremely friendly and attentive. The sushi is great and I highly recommend the Deep Water cocktail!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, affordable and presented well. We ordered various sushi rolls and drinks--all of which were prepared well.   While the food might only get four stars, the attentiveness of the staff is really remarkable. The staff was friendly and did not act as if they couldn't help just because you weren't one of their assigned tables."}
{"text":"Great sushi...when they're serving it. Their website and a sign outside the door advertises happy hour every day from 3-7 and 10-12 and when we went in last night at 10 they told us their kitchen was closed! Get your story straight, please."}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice.  The atmosphere and location are good, the rolls are pretty good, the drinks are good too.  Spicy salmon, philly, spicy yellowtail, fire-breathing salmon. All delicious, well-prepared.  I'd definitely eat here again if it weren't for downtown prices."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Was upset about 2015 price increase and they discontinued the squid and Nancy so disappointed about that but still love the sushi and shah there."}
{"text":"wow just wow love the sushi here and happy hour is amazing. favorite sushi is the tootsie rolls from here just amazing with the eel sauce just melts in your mouth. Great food here and awesome customer care so i was very happy thank you squid ink!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Tuesday. Food was mediocre (probably 3 stars), but the service was really bad (1 star). The potstickers were lukewarm and my sushi was not flavorful. Would not come back."}
{"text":"Had the seaweed salad and grilled salmon, not bad.  Cool young scene and good service."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to checking this place out since it opened in Phoenix.  The atmosphere was exactly what I expected, chic yet laid back.  It's right next to where they have the ice rink set up for ice skating and the massive Christmas tree so it was a great view from the bar.  The server was friendly and fast.  I had the Deep Water cocktail...I didn't realize it was spicy so I wasn't really expecting that, but it was pretty good.  Also got an order of the dumplings which were exactly what you'd expect, nothing over the top.  Sushi we had a house roll and something basic, both were good and again...supah fast!    Location is great as I mentioned, but the parking was meh.  Had to park and walk a bit which can really suck in 4in heels.  If I'm in the area I will absolutely stop in again because it was an overall good experience, just didn't knock the ball outta the park? Know wadda mean? :)"}
{"text":"I wouldn't consider myself a sushi snob and I'm far from a sushi expert, however I love sushi. I could eat it every day. I've had sushi at restaurants all over the U.S. Squid Ink was good...not great...not mind blowing...but good.   I recommend this place on the random late nights when you get a sushi craving. Romantic date night? Not so much. If you're looking for high end sushi dining, this is not the place. If you're looking for a great happy hour or a quick sushi meal before catching a show...Squid Ink is a great place to try. The menu has plenty of sushi to choose from w/ a large fish and flavor variety. I am a fan of the Vegas roll. My boyfriend enjoys the ramen (something for everyone). The cocktails are great too. I do really love the happy hour menu. I had 2 rolls of sushi and a glass of wine for $20. You can't beat that!  I get that downtown Phoenix is still in a \"revival\" stage so my expectations for a dining experience with ambiance are not sky high, but I was hoping for a little more pizazz here. I do visit regularly and really enjoy the staff. They're all awesome. I just wish the menu evolved more often."}
{"text":"I've gone there multiple times the service is not very good. The waitress/waiter visit the table only once every 30 minuets. Bar is not very good."}
{"text":"Great sushi spot in downtown Phoenix. We sat outside to enjoy the night. It's right next to the ice skating rink which is decorated in Christmas theme now.    Regarding the sushi, we got 2 speciality rolls (around $13 each) and 2 beers. The sushi rolls were very fresh. I recommend the blueberry sour beer for those sour beer lovers."}
{"text":"Average sushi. Mediocre service at best. We were sat in a booth near the hostess stand and were ignored for at least 10 minutes. We had to stop a server passing by asking if we could get water. His excuse was that \"the server was really busy\". The place was not full at all. Finally our server Victor came.  He was OK until i had to ask for napkins and sushi plates. I didn't bother asking for chop sticks. (We only had one set, one for each person i guess) Needles to say, by the time we got our sushi, we already had a bad taste in our mouths! The only good thing in this place is the server Justin! He's the only one to greet us and ask how our night was going! Everyone else pretty much ignored us."}
{"text":"We hit this place up super bowl weekend! We had a demanding table of 6, and our waiter Jeff was amazing!   We were waiting for our other friends that were running behind, and 10 mins before midnight when we were ready to order, they say we can't order sushi anymore. We were kinda upset that we weren't told this sooner since we were there for a while. Any Who long story shot Jeff and the manager on duty made it happen and we all left happy!  The sushi was amazing and the service was excellent. Even the hostesses & bartenders while we were waiting for table. It was an extremely busy night and the crew handled it beautifully! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Tried this sushi spot's Spicy Tuna Roll, Spicy Crab Roll, and Ramen because it was late, Harumi was closed, and I wondered what relatively cheaper sushi would taste like Downtown. The rolls lacked flavor, the wasabi is weak, and the Ramen tasted a lot like instant with fresh scallions and nori.  Maybe I'll give their nigiri or sashimi a try next time."}
{"text":"The sushi was ok. They brought us the wrong roll but then brought out the correct roll. I like the watermelon martini, but it is sour. We also asked to sit at the end of the patio, but the host would not let us. He said since we were only 2 we had to sit at a table for 2 and save the 4 table for guests of 4... no one sat where we wanted to sit while we dined... see attached pictures  Haha. Then they brought us the wrong check..."}
{"text":"Wasn't very impressed. Waiter barely came by, had to ask for water twice before it was even brought to us. Everyone's food came out at different times, my friend who received hers last-her order wasn't even right after she and the waiter specifically discussed it. Sushi rice was rubbery as well as the imitation crab. Nice ambiance and music. Also, the wait was half the time they said it would be so that was nice. There are other sushi places in downtown Phoenix that I'll visit before this one next time."}
{"text":"Finally, a good sushi place downtown!  Yesterday I emailed a friend who works a block from my office inquiring about meeting after work sometime the sample Squid Ink's happy hour menu. He promptly responded \"Let's do this tonight!\" because it's been months since we've eaten sushi. So we did. Aside from being open in a construction zone (apartments are being constructed on top of the hotel that's above this location) this is a gorgeous restaurant. The staff are friendly and attentive, but don't hover [thankfully]. During happy hour, select sushi rolls and signature cocktails are half priced; there are other specials but that's really what we were going for. These select items are limited, but enough to feed our sushi fixes. We had an order of shrimp tempura, spicy salmon and spicy yellowtail (half priced HH specials), an order of salmon nigiri and octopus sashimi. Each was terrific, the octopus especially. We also order saki bombers. Sated and slightly buzzed, we paid our bill (nearly $50, not too bad considering the amount of food) and rode the light rail home, happy.   On a side note, the restrooms are tucked behind the main dining room. They were pretty.  We both decided we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Good solid resturant. Serves a large variety of sushi and sashimi but also many cooked dishes. My son and I tried it out and both had sushi and several rolls. Everything was very good, fresh and presented well. We noticed at the next table a kobe burger and it looked terrific.   Will definitely return and will continue to sample other menu items. A big thumbs up for Squid Ink."}
{"text":"I decided to meet a friend for lunch sort of last minute yesterday.  She works in a pocket of town where there are not too many restaurants, so she suggested we find something at Cityscape.  She had been wanting to try this place, so we popped in.  It was a cute place, with the sushi bar directly in front of you and a bit to the left when you walk in.    The table we were seated in was in an area to the right that was way too small for my comfort.  The aisle was way too narrow.  As I was trying to walk to my seat at the end of the row, two waiters assumed right of way and I had to yield and wait even though my friend was already seated.  It was a minor inconvenience, but I felt claustrophobic for most of the meal with people walking so close behind me.  There was no way to scoot my chair even an extra inch or two back.    The tap water is served with a skewered slice of lemon and cucumber, which was a nice touch.    I ordered the Spicy Tuna bowl, which came with a huge helping of spicy tuna, rice, avocado, asparagus and eggplant tempura.  It was quite tasty.  She ordered a Flying Phoenix roll, which had spicy crab, shrimp tempura, avocado and was topped with tuna tataki.  It was very well presented.  Our bill was only $30 with tip included, so it was a fair price for a nice lunch.   Overall, I liked Squid Ink Sushi.  In the future, I would opt to sit at the sushi bar or ask to be seated at one of the tables that was not in the area with the small aisle."}
{"text":"Great quality sushi fish if they have what you're looking for in stock. Except for once out of the five times I've been here within the last two months, they were out of either the Uni or Toro. Always.  When you ask the servers or sushi chefs about when they get in their fish, they never give you a straight answer and say all throughout the week. I know all the Japanese restaurant distributors here in AZ and they will set a day of the week for your deliveries.  The sushi chefs also have a tendency to make your portions of Tobiko and Uni quite smaller when you reorder the nigiri for round two. For example, I order uni to gauge quality and when I like it, I'll order a few more. The upcoming orders are noticeably less full.  Will continue to visit and post updates."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place a 1 star because we have to and the location is nice.  We sat down outside at 6:55 before the happy hour ended.  Our server comes up and we want to order the HH special but she tells us it's 7:00 and we can't order the specials due to the automated systems. Ok well we tried right?   I order a drink because I wasn't too hungry.  My cousin and her friend were looking at the menu to see what they wanted to order.  So our waitress comes back to the table and only asks my cousins friend if she was ready to order, takes her order and walks away.  Then she comes back to ask for my cousins order but in the most awkward and rude way.  So my cousin order like the crab wontons or something, and they turned out to be really salty.  So of course, our waitress doesn't come back to see how everything is, we have to wave her down.  She comes to the table, and my cousin tells her the wontons are really salty.  You can clearly see the salt chunks on top so she asks her if thats normal and all the waitress says is \"yup\".  Really?  Yup? Oh I already know what my tip is going to be after I get the bill, learn your manners girlfriend.  So once we're done, we are ready to pay buuuut our waitress is nowhere insight.  So we're noticing how super awkward she is and she makes us feel really uncomfortable.  I have to remember that I'm not longer in California and that racism is pretty huge in Arizona but geeze, why work with PEOPLE if you have some sort of prejudice?!  I'm just assuming but I got that vibe that she does not like too much diversity in one sitting.  So there was another waiter near and we ask what's her problem and he's like \"I'm not really sure\", so we tell him we're ready to pay.  It looks like he goes to the back to find her and a few moments later she comes back says \"I heard you were looking for me..' What?! WHAT!!! Giiiiirl you seriously have an attitude problem for no reason at all.  We give her our money to pay, because you know, we surprisingly can afford it.  So we ask if we can validate with her and she says yes.  I was digging in my purse to find my ticket but I couldn't but she stood there just staring and waiting like I was inconveniencing her.  Mind you this is the longest she's ever stood at our table the entire night because she walks away super quick when she had to bring the food to the table.  I tell her nevermind, I'll get the lady at the front desk to validate, because she was making me feel very uncomfortable.  We filled out our feedback cards and let them know right away that her service was beyond unacceptable.  I don't know if I could ever give this place another chance.  I was so disappointed with the way we were treated but who knows, maybe one day.  The food overall, eh.  Maybe if it wasn't for the lackluster service, it would have been better, but homegirl ruined everyones appetite."}
{"text":"Location: it is located in the heart of downtown Phoenix. There is a ice skating ring right in front of the entrance during Christmas season - which is pretty cool.   Service: When we first walked in, we were sitting at a temp table until the table we reserved was ready (and it was never ready). No one was assigned to where we sat while we were waiting. We were there without a glass of water nor anyone stopping by for 10-15 minutes. We finally asked the host who our server was and he told us that we weren't assigned to anyone until the table was ready. He knew that we were upset and offered to take our drink order and found us a waitress right away. Service was decent since then but wish it would have been a bit more organized since the start.   Food: I ordered the fried tofu from the appetizer menu and it was great. However, the Ramon noodle was super salty. I couldn't even finish the broth because of it. My friend ordered a salmon dish and it was very fishy. He couldn't finish his menu neither.   Rating: I am hesitant to come here again. Menu was overpriced probably due to location, but I think I can get much better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Great Service with a smile, it was clean, and had Excellent Sushi. As good as the Sushi was, the dessert was to die for. We had the Hawaiian Bread Pudding.. OHMYBABYJEEZY! So damn good! The Miso soup was pretty good also."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me in here for a lunch date and I was extremely Happy with everything! Food was delicious and the bartender was super nice & attentive to us. Thanks for providing us with a great experience, we'll definitely be back..."}
