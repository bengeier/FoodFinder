{"text":"We were there for dinner.  We were the only table there (just before 6pm).   Before we left, there were only another table of 4 and a table of one.  We went to this place knowing it is over priced, but thinking you get what you pay for.    First off, the tea was luke warm/cold and had no taste.   Asked to warm up the tea.   Same temperature, asked the waitress to make a new hot pot of tea, this time it was hot but still very diluted. The sashimi was fresh, but so thin that we really didn't taste anything.  The beef tataki, sliced too thick and more like a salad since it was on a bed of Lettuce and we were given a cup of ginger salad dressing on the side.    They flamed the playboy roll, didn't like the 'smoke' flavour.   I believe they used the fondue fuel on the hot plate.   Would have been better if they use liquor....Would have taste better without the flame.   Don't remember this being mentioned on the description on the menu.   

I say, spend your money else where.    Too over priced for average food"}
{"text":"My mum and brother went here yesterday. First they forgot the miso soup, then the negiri rice kept falling apart, the tea was cold, the salmon belly \"looked off\"...and to wrap everything up, my brother has been sick since. Will not be trying this place. Ever. And I'm a huge sushi fan."}
{"text":"It started off with us being placed by the window off to the corner where it was really dark. I had to use my phone to read the menu.Then when the tea came it was cold! You do not get a tea pot and the waitress will forget to refill your cup and when you do get it, it will be cold! All the food that was supposed to be hot was not! And most of the sushi was covered in Mayo! The sushi did not have much flavor. This was very disappointing and the price was way to expensive for what it was. It had a lot of potential and was not satisfying!! I will not be telling friends and family to go there and I will never return!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night.  Only 11 diners in the entire restaurant.  Food still took 45 mins to arrive.  Food was overpriced and mediocre quality.  Some customers commend them on the size of their rolls, but it's just a lot of rice.  Menu selection also lousy.  Will never go back.  

Kinjo is a much better option...quality not much better, but price and service is a lot better."}
{"text":"When this location first opened close to home my wife and I were both excited, both being fans of their mission location.  We have tried this location over 5 times times.  The last visit/order will be our last.  In a nutshell:

Price: High considering what you get. Quality is average but prices are premium for Calgary. 

Timing:  Have ordered take out via Nomme and orders consistently take over 1 hr to arrive, last order came around 1.5 hrs.  We live 5 mins away.

Quality: Poor compared to the mission location, especially considering high price point.  Seared sashimi not seared at all!  Duck salad used to be our favorite, one time ordered take out and they forgot the salad dressing.  The second time we ordered they forgot most toppings, it was basically dried duck, lettuce, and a few slices of melon.  Picture below  

There are many other options for japanese in the city, do yourself a favor and go to another place."}
{"text":"The sushi is great but the service is terrible. Came for lunch on a Saturday afternoon with 2 other tables in the place. Had to ask multiple times to refill tea. We saw our order was up on the bar and it took her 5 mins to go get it.  
5 stars for the food one for the service."}
{"text":"I have been to this Towa location a couple of times now... once for dinner and once for lunch.  Both times the restaurant was pretty quiet.  I guess not many people know of it yet.  The first time we came, it was only a few days after they have opened.  Our dinner order was mostly sashimis and sushi rolls.  They were very well done.  For my lunch experience, I ordered their chirashi donburi on their lunch menu.  It was good but they only had three types of fish (2 pieces each of the common salmon, tuna, red snapper) and egg on it I was more looking forward to more variety of fish but just a smaller lunch portion.  Overall our experience at this location was good.  The raw fish was fresh.  We were well taken care of and enjoyed our time there.  I look forward to trying different things here."}
{"text":"Their rolls are fantastic. We tried their tonkatsu ramen, the pork belly is to die for."}
{"text":"I stopped in here today for lunch I was hoping for a hot bowl of Miso soup and some sushi. This place was not the best choice. The waitress had limited English skills. She was the only waitress serving 3 other tables in this other wise empty place. I told her I would be writing a review. She did not care...
I started out by asking if I could pay an up charge for the Donburi salmon and tuna to be upgraded to Toro and wild salmon she didn't really understand me then asked the chef who I think was the owner
as well and said no substitutions if I'm paying for it this would be an upgrade not a substitution. Best part of my lunch it came out fast.... the sushi was slimey and still somewhat frozen. I had to remind the waitress that my Donburi was to come with a miso soup she had Check the menu then came back with a cold bowl of miso soup and cold tea.
I then went to use the soya sauce it was in a sticky drippy container in a filthy holder in fact every table had the same dirty container she replaced mine with one from another table. This place was filthy in general greasy walls and glass and sadly I think it is less than a year old very unkept I am quite certain the health board will be shutting them down in short order. So many better Japanese restaurants in the area to try Misato, Haru this place was a disgusting disappointment sionara Towa....."}
