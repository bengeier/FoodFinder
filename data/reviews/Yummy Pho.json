{"text":"I somehow stumbled upon this gem and absolutely loved it! The quality and experience here is incredibly premium without them coming across like they're trying too hard. The menu selection process is similar to ordering at hot pot and is definitely not the cheapest in the GTA, but as with so many other things in life; you get what you pay for. The broth is clear and clean tasting and the noodles are always cooked perfectly. There's nothing I hate more than overlooked rice noodles. This establishment is cash only which can be cumbersome but as long as you're prepared, you're golden. Oh and try the cold coffee too, incredibly good!"}
{"text":"Completely unsanitary eating conditions. My utensils had left over food on it, and the general cleanliness of the restaurant was less than acceptable."}
{"text":"My gf and I tried Yummy Pho after we bought a $10 for $20 worth of food deal from one of the group deal websites.  It turns out to be the worst Vietnamese cuisine experiences we've ever had by far.  So many things went wrong.  Wrong kind of pork was used in pho.  Wrong kind of flour was used to make spring rolls.  The food was expensive compared to other Vietnamese restaurants in Markham.  Even though we got the $10 for $20 deal, we ended up paying about the same price as what we would have paid at, say, Pho 88, except that the food at Pho 88 (or any other Vietnamese restaurants in Markham) would be so much better.  On a positive note, the service was nice.  The owner just needs to replace the Chinese chef with someone who actually knows how to cook Vietnamese food.  Come here if you think you may enjoy a Hong Kong version of Vietnamese food.  But if you're looking for Vietnamese food (i.e. what Vietnamese food should be), you will NOT get it here.  The food here is hardly qualified as Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Ask if they have BEAN SPROUTS before ordering!  Not the best place for pho when they don't even have bean sprouts! They ran out of bean sprouts three times I went there for lunch.   They didn't even inform you when you placed the order. They just let you find out til you asked and hope that you never asked. It's always the same waitresses/cashier there so the customer service is very consistent, consistently poor. If the cashier is the management, she clearly led by example for all staff. All the times they run out of bean sprouts they won't admit they don't have it, they just keep blaming on the delivery guy, they have it but in the truck of the delivery guy. Honestly. How hard is it to pick up some from the supermarket when there are more than a few nearby the area.    Cons  - Poor customer service.  Training is needed for all staff.   Pros  - The place is cleaner and quieter than other pho places.   To Try - Two things I particularly like are their lime juice and Vietnamese coffee!  Updates  - The prices have gone up in price $2 across the menu this year. The pho size has gone up, but the rice dishes have gone down.  Re"}
{"text":"the decor is nicer than your average pho place but that's about it, but when I want pho, I just want something quick to fill my hunger, so that doesn't mater to me.  I was referred here by co-workers who order lunch here regularly. I didn't really like it, it wasn't good! and I thought maybe cause it's take out. On the take-out menu there for a coupon for a free spring roll in-store only(their spring roll is different, so I thought I'd try)  So one day I went after work, and after we ordered and showed them the coupon, they said that was only for the grand opening and it's no longer valid, then why are you still printing menu's with this coupon on it? even the ones in the store had this coupon, it's like tricking us to go in to the restaurant! FRAUD!  anyways, we didn't want to go somewhere else over something so little so we ordered and paid for the spring roll anyways, It was horrible! it's like eating crunchy air, there is hardly NO filling inside and the wraper is hard and Sharp. I'd rather eat a regular spring roll any day.  The pho was not fresh and they only have BEEF soup base, no chicken or vegetarian, the bowl was huge with NOTHING inside practically. the large was comparable to a small at other pho places and the food was OVERPRICED for pho. the rice options were minimal, you can choose lemon grass chicken or lemon grass pork LOL.  Will not return to this restaurant again. I would only order take out with my co-workers if there was no other options and I don't want to go out for lunch."}
{"text":"Yummy Pho is one of many Pho restaurants in Markham.   One of my friends recommended it so we went here and I ordered a house special pho beef noodle soup.  The portions at this restaurant were extra big.  I ordered the normal (large) noodle soup and got a big bowl.  One of my friends ordered a large (extra large) and got a REALLY big bowl of noodle soup.  The portions definitely make you feel that you're getting good value.  For their beef noodle soup, they gave us diced onion instead of the usual bean sprout.  I liked the rare beef and beef balls they put in the noodle soup, but didn't enjoy the beef tripe.  Overall, the food was slightly above average and service was average.  I would visit again but I would treat this place about the same as another average Pho restaurant.  3.5/5.0"}
{"text":"Just a regular Pho place with an interesting twist: build your own Pho. You start with the broth, add the noodles, then the meat and voila!  Great from my point of view because I was able to order a Beef broth, with rice noodles with tripe. Usually tripe is combined with other ingredients such as sliced beef. For the tripe purist, this is a plus.  I would have given this place another star had the broth carried more taste. Service is friendly and pleasant. Price was around $8.00 for a large portion.  Reliable and good for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I wish they let me give half stars!  3.5 stars for this pho place. Been here a few times and I think I should finally give it a review.   The food is acceptable, soup base is ok (have had better). I believe the owner is from Vietnam but she can speak Cantonese.   Quality of food may be better than some pho places. Quantity is slightly less, bowl is huge with alot of soup. Only a few pieces if beef and not alot of pho noodles.  If you are a big guy/eater, one large bowl may not be enough for u. They have good lunch specials where you can add $1 to upgrade your lunch meal and get a drink even the strong Vietnamese ice coffee.   The coffee is really strong...I tried it once during lunch and it kept me up until very late.   Tried the spring rolls, liked it cuz its a bit different from other places.  They have groupon deals sometimes it works nice. The regular price is a bit pricey compared to other pho places.   All in all, I will come back when I'm in the area and craving for pho."}
{"text":"This place has went downhill since it opened. Been there a few times when it recently opened and it was average but they had good afternoon tea deals with coupons.  Recently when I went, I seriously think this place is garage and why they haven't closed yet. The servers were friendly and nice while serving us but the food was totally opposite! We ordered a side snack to share between 5 of us and each ordered a noodle soup. The portion size of the noodles were good for lunch but the toppings which were in it was ridiculously small. For a beef noodle that costs $10, you would think there would be more than 3 pieces. We also asked if there were more toppings in some of their specialities and it literally what they have listed. For around $10 a small noodle, there's only 3 different toppings and bean sprouts being one of them, that doesn't satisfy me at all.  The taste of it overall was average, nothing that would bring me back again if I was in the area, plenty of other good choices around!! Definitely you don't get what you pay for here! If they want customers to come back, they should be less CHEAP on the toppings or just charge less!!"}
{"text":"The pho tastes like pho... hard to mess that up. but the vermicelli was pretty brutal... almost no flavour in the dish.  There are better places for pho in the area."}
{"text":"Yummy Pho is a solid neighbourhood Vietnamese restaurant that specializes in pho and vermicelli (dry pho in bowl), appetizers and beverages.  Though the menu is limited, it cooks every thing well, especially the vermicelli IMHO (hence, the name yummy pho).    The restaurant is a little hard to find, in a strip mall."}
{"text":"Came here to Yummy Pho the other day.  After tasting all the pho places in Markham area, it's a nice surprise to find a decent pho place right near my condo.  Located in the plaza right behind First Markham Place, you'll spot it as you turn onto Fairburn Dr.  The decor is nice, space is small, service was good, and atmosphere is a little loud since it's an open space.  It was a full house when we went there.  Ordered a special house beef pho, lemon grass chicken wings, and a spicy rice with chicken and pineapple dish.  The pho was excellent, in the Markham area I would say it is next best to Pho 88 only because the beef wasn't as thin and easy to eat as I would like.  The chicken wings were cooked to perfection (though I would have liked a stronger lemon grass taste), and the spicy rice dish was also very yummy without being too spicy.  Used a $10 for $20 voucher off LivingDeal, but it was so good I would come back again and pay regular price."}
{"text":"Located in the plaza behind First Markham Place. Vietnamese food done by Chinese. Cash only.   BBQ pork vermicelli $7.75 - it was basically Chinese style BBQ pork on vermicelli. It was a nice lean piece of pork with no fat. It tasted good. No complaints.  Satay soup base + vermicelli with rare beef and tripe $8.75 (large) - Soup had nice flavours and was totally drinkable. It didn't taste overly salty which is good. I thought the satay soup would be spicy but there is hardly any spiciness to it. There was a good amount of rare beef and tripe. I wish the beef was more rare and cut a bit more then and this is the only complaint I could think of.   Service was fast and friendly.   A solid 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Continuing on my pho theme. In particular beef brisket and tendon.  Fresh noodles option is a nice touch. The decor is low-key modern in certain areas. But the nice touches end there.  The bean sprouts were offered to me blanched. This is the second restaurant that offered them this way. Can't figure out the necessity, but it's not a big deal.  The portion was average, served in a huge bowl. It meant elevated expectations that were disappointed ultimately. They may be kicking the person who initially purchased the bowls fiercely on the behind. Not a fatal flaw, but would make some customers uncomfortable.  The broth was savory but did not taste like a beef broth made with fresh ingredients. More like something put together with off-the-shelf soup base.  The brisket slices tasted more like salted pork belly. Enough said on that.  The tendons were in worse shape than the brisket. The tendons I like are full of an almost nutty, fatty flavor from long, slow cooking in broth, even if there is no fat in the tendons themselves. They would give a bit of resistance when you bite into them without being rubbery or plasticky, and soft without being slimy. Unfortunately, the tendons here were the opposite. Tasteless. Some tendons were stiff like plastic/rubber bands. Others were over-cooked to sliming apart.  I went all out and got a glass of coconut water as well. Way too sweet to even pretend to be natural.  They gave away a sweet black sesame soup, which I usually liked. Unfortunately, it is out of place in a pho restaurant, and sadly disappointing because it tasted like it was whirled up from a powder.  The location is out of the way and it order to draw in more customers than folks who work in the surrounding plazas, changes are needed. Sorry to say, I would not be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Special House Beef Pho: They give you a large portion of noodles and beefs. The flanks and rare beef in the pho was delicious and tender.  Crab Paste Fried Rice with Shrimps: This dish was surprisingly good and good balance of the saltiness from the paste, and sweetness from the pork floss. The fried rice was dry and not too moist where the rice clumps together.  Service: It was very pleasant and I love that they ask you whether you want your bean sprouts cooked or raw, without me asking.  Overall, a good meal and I would come back!"}
{"text":"This Pho place has been in business now for over 6 or 7 months and I've waited for quite some time to put a review up after trying the food several times.  The restaurant is situated in another plaza BEHIND First Markham Place next to another popular eatery, A La Kitchen.    Disclaimer: I have not tried a lot of the items on their menu and my rating is based on their rare beef noodle, a staple for me at ALL Viet restaurants.  I've been to many Pho places in Markham (Kimpo, 88, Pho Vietnam, etc...) and I have to say, this is one of the best places for AUTHENTIC Pho broth.  There's a good balance of spices and herbs to bring the flavour out and you get a generous portion of meats and noodles with your broth.  I only noticed this the other day but this is one of the few pho places I eat at where I don't have to add sauces to enhance the broth flavour (hoisin, saracha, etc...)  The other thing is that good and unique are their spring rolls.  They use a different type of wrap and it's light and crispy.     Combined with their lunch specials ($1 Vietnamese coffees??) this is definitely worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"Just another average pho restaurant ran by Chinese people. I mean, it's not like I'm saying their food is bad.. no. Pho is just the kind of food no one really craves but no one objects to eating it when it's offered on the table. With sooooo many chinese owned pho restaurants around, it's hard to pin-point what is good and what isn't anymore.."}
{"text":"3.5 star   Specials brought me to Yummy Pho! When I saw the coupon for a free pork rolls in the magazine yesterday night, I know where I am going for lunch today.   Yummy Pho is located at the plaza right behind First Markham Place next to A la Kitchen.   Nice decoration and extremely clean as it was just open recently. Menu is really simple, not as extensive as other restaurant but still has all the usual Pho, Bun and Rice dishes.   Lunch Specials on weekdays for $1 extra for a drink of your choice, that includes cold Vietnamese coffee!!! which cost $3.25 regularly!   Special House Pho ($6.80) was nicely done. Perfect size for lunch as I enjoyed that with my complimentary pork rolls. Broth was clear and quite flavoured, dry noodles was nicely done and have a lot of meat.....   Iced Coffee for a $1 was strong.... really strong.... really fixed my caffeine craving......   And when I saw my bill, there's another special... 10% off grand opening specials!!   I guess all these specials makes Yummy Pho really special! Come and take advantage of all these grand opening specials before they are gone!   Cash Only!"}
