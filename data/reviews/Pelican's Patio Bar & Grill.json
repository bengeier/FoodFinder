{"text":"I was there for dinner with husband,  we both ordered hamburger mushroom burger was cheese was good. but I ordered the bacon and sauce. It was dry and lack taste.    The service was very friendly, the decor was nice. had nice patio.  I wish they would offer the fish taco for dinner menu.  There was items on lunch menu that was not offer on dinner menu.  The entree dinners was a bit high for me from  $ 15 - $ 24 for crab cakes."}
{"text":"Small bar, no real drink specials, misters on the patio are really annoying, especially after you order food."}
{"text":"This is a great little \"Key West\" type establishment. They frequently have live music, and their outside dining is very enjoyable. You almost forget that you are in the middle of a city and not at the shore. Their menu is somewhat limited, but everything that they do have, is excellent and reasonably priced. I should mention here, that their wait staff is outstanding."}
{"text":"I wish I could give more stars, but the service is so bad, I cannot! The atmosphere is beachy and fun and the patio would be nicer if the furnishings weren't hard metal. They could use some cushions.   Our waitress was nice, but didn't have a clue. She didn't know what the fish of the day was, she didn't know the drink specials either. Every fish dish I went to order was not available, except the mahi mahi. Which was quite good. My daughter in law ordered the jerk chicken which had a weird tasting sauce on it and the chicken was overcooked and dry. Another at the table ordered a burger on which the lettuce was dripping wet. One of the most appalling things was that just about all the servers and I think some kitchen staff were all sitting at the bar talking. Two female employees were all over each other, they eventually went outside, but soon thereafter came back in still hugging each other intensely. I wonder if any of them were a manager of it the owner was anywhere around? I will not be back anytime soon. If this place is going to make it, the manager needs to crack the whip around there, train the employees to at least be aware of the specials of the day and get the employess out from the bar and waiting on customers."}
{"text":"I think this place still reels from past management or cooks or something else. But even in the 7 months that I have lived here the place has improved tremendously.  Sometimes the hubby and I come here for a cocktail/lunch and things are pretty status quo. I do see that there are a bunch of fun new additions to the menu and we are always satisfied. Often drink specials are pretty good too.  Service here is always good, particularly because it isn't normally packed. The owners often float around, who are adorable,  This Sunday we went for the brunch- it was an amazingly delicious surprise...and I'll tell ya why. The owner and his wife actually cook some of the delicious homemade offerings at the buffet: pasta salads, sausage patties, desserts. You can absolutely tell that this isn't flash-produced dishes.  Also, the food goes beyond typical eggs,potatoes and meat (but they are all good too). There were salads, fruits and veggies, grits, a carving station, omelet station, biscuits & gravy...and did I say cake? Cocktails are also on special.  We sat on the patio where there was a mellow and very cool sax player. It was really all you could ask for on a Sunday.  If you have had a marginal experience in the past, try it again and take note of all the extras that the owners are bringing to the table...no pun intended ; )"}
{"text":"Visited the Pelican Patio last Weekend with my 3 kids (first visit) We decided to sit on the patio as that's where most were sitting. The best thing about our visit was the guitar/singer. Service was horrible and took forever for our food. When we first got there 2 servers were bickering over whose table it was to service. Took 10 minutes to order our food and 30 minutes for them to bring it out. I ordered the grill chicken sandwich and side salad. Salad was good but the sandwich was missing the mayo that was supposed to come on it. I waited 10 mins before I could get the servers attention for mayo and a refill. When it came my food was cold and bum was stale. The kids grilled cheese was better than the chicken. People sitting next to us were smoking and were never told they could not. I would think the patio would still be considered dining. Overall, I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to brunch last Sunday and sat on the patio. The food was really good and the price is great. They have a brunch buffet with a chef to make omelets.  I have heard that this place had bad food in the past, but they got rid of the cook and hired a chef. He is really great. I don't know if it is true or not, but I hear he was the chef at Carpe Diem.   Anyway, the only part of the experience that wasn't pleasant was our server. She seemed to take forever to bring us drinks, brought us the wrong drinks, took a while to get the replacement drinks, but she was also very busy. The patio was full.   I will definitely be back on Sundays for brunch."}
{"text":"Pelican's is a great place for lunch or dinner. Try the soup and prime rib sandwich combo, a good value and good food. For a wow, if you are a burger lover, order the Carolina Chipolte Burger. Fabulous, on my all time best burger list!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the patio is fun. Feels like a tropical rain forest.   I had the surf n turf (19.99). Lobster was cold and undercooked. Steak was well done, I had ordered it medium rare. Sane thing happened to a couple sitting at the table next to us. My wife's salmon was good. The topping was so sweet it tasted like a desert. She scrapped the topping off and it was really good. Our daughter had the Maui and though it was good. Our son really liked the pizza."}
{"text":"We enjoy coming here for brunch on Sunday. They have a nice patio outside with a nice buffet. The also have an omelet station and will make eggs or an omelet however you like. The inside looks nice also, sort of an island feel to it. There was also a sax player outside playing some nice tunes while we ate."}
{"text":"Visited this spot a second time, and tried the burger. It was a disappointment that it was a flat machine-pressed hamburger.   The first time here, I was very favorably impressed by the Carolina Cuban, the fries, and the beer and warm fall afternoon on the patio undoubtedly helped.  I still like the place, but if they want to make it, they better improve their burgers, going to a good hand-pressed quality ground beef, and learn to cook them right!  But I'll wait for warmer weather to go back."}
{"text":"We went here for a friend's birthday, there were 8 of us.  When I called to set up the reservation the person who I spoke with was very nice and accomodating. When we got to the restaurant our table was ready and that part was positive and that's about where that ends as far as positivity..  There were only 3 available menus that we had to share and the place wasn't even that busy. It's kind of weird to not have menus for each chair.  We ordered one app for the whole table and the waitress only brought 3 plates, there were 8 of us sharing.  The bar drinks that we ordered were unpalatable and we had to send every one back.. The mojito was not at all sweet and we had to add our own simple syrup. The waitress gave us a little squirt bottle of it and we put it in ourselves.. The fish bowl tasted like rubbing alcohol, it was sooo strong. The beer was good, but they didn't make the beer.  The \"birthday girl\" ordered the olive burger and the waitress didn't bring ketchup after asking her 3 times I finally walked back to the bar and got it for her so she could eat her meal. Of course it was cold by then. The fish tacos had the skimpiest amount of tuna ever. They were bland, cold and the side items (mashed pots) which I didn't even order, were cold, the plantains were very good.  The salads that the other people at my table ordered looked great except for the chincey and skimpy amound of dressing that came with them. I had to get up to ask for dressing becuase no one ever checked on us again.  The waitress, was aweful, but was at least nice. She gave the birthday girl dessert on the house but only brought one fork, when there were 8 of us..  So, overall I would not at all go back.. Which is a shame becuase it has potential but poor management and service and aweful food."}
{"text":"Went to Pelican for lunch with my husband. Service was great, food was only average.  I got the fish tacos which were good, but a little bland.  I've definitely had better, but for ~$7 I thought it was good.  The decor is a little random inside.  If it wasn't so cold, I'm sure the patio would have been nice.  I guess it depends on what you are looking for... if you want a average meal at a average price, this is your place!"}
