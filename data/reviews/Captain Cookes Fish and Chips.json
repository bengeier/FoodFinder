{"text":"The little take out place that seems frozen in time circa 1940. Fish and chips delicious,chips are crispy and abundant...halibut portion on the small side,but you're not paying much,its a cheap and quick lunch."}
{"text":"A small mom-and-pop type place on Parliament Street. The interior looks like it hasn't changed in 30 years, and you can see the kitchen where they are preparing your food (if that is an issue for you). I had the chicken and chips, but will go back for the fish. The chicken was moist and tasty, but I wish the batter had more seasoning. The fries were delicious, and appear to be cooked in lard (if you remember the flavour of fries cooked in lard and not vegetable oil).  The owner was friendly and served me promptly, though the food (cooked from scratch) took about ten minutes. If the neighbourhood and hole-in-the-wall appearance doesn't bother you, this place is a great value and definitely worth the prices."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for about 15 years. Owner cooks the food to order. Always friendly, food is consistently good."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was in public school. Fries and gravy, sometimes a burger. Fish and chips are great - fish could be a little larger but considering the price it evens out. Not many old school fish and chip joints around anymore."}
{"text":"$5 halibut with no tax? Is this place for real? With every other place charging at least $10 for a single piece of halibut, is this the best bargain in Toronto, or just a wannabe? Raw halibut at the fishmonger usually goes for around $25/pound, so I wasn't expecting anything substantial.  Well, it's really halibut! But the piece you get is small and very thin. The batter makes it thicker than it really is. If you get two pieces, you still get less actual halibut than at any other fish and chip joint. This is strictly a neighborhood takeout place in a low income area that allows those who can't normally afford halibut to try it in small amounts. But it's nothing special. Don't go out of your way to go here."}
{"text":"Small store on Parliament seriously a gem!!! The owner is so nice, and the fish & chips are good!!! Fish is kind of small but still worth their awesome prices :) would come back here!! For the love of fish and chips"}
{"text":"The tiniest piece of fish ever for $8. The fish wasn't good either - mostly breading. I'm pretty sure it's a store-bought frozen fish filet that they throw in the deep fryer. Based on the few reviews, and the not-an-actual piece of fish from the fish and chips place, I suspect this place could be a front rather than a legit restaurant. Don't recommend it."}
