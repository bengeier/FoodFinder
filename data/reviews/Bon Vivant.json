{"text":"This place is very quaint with a cozy and intimate feel. Though I can't speak to the tastiness of the food, they have several interesting cocktail choices that the bartender will 'perform' for you. While the drinks are good, I felt it was a little over-priced for the quality."}
{"text":"T'was a frigid cold Canadian winter with double digits freezing ass temperatures. My stomach was rumbling with calls of despair and therefore guided me to this place. Obviously lots of other stomachs felt the same so we did have to wait a bit for a spot. No worries. 

Once seated, at the bar, right in front of the open kitchen, you're automatically drawn by the dishes prepared by the chefs.

I opted for the Huevos rancheros on cast iron served wth Papas Bravas, chorizo, avocados, chipotle salsa & corn tortillas. Cool winter comfort food, tasty and quite satisfactory but I did envy the Croque Madame plate more...

For \"desert\" I had the French Toast. An evil Brioche bread with Grand Marnier flambé fruits, condensed milk & whipped cream. Although the inside consistency did almost feel like a 'flanc' at times, the flambé fruits were simply fantastic.

I will definitely be back to try countless other things that looked wonderful."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place, and there are plenty of good reasons to visit--unfortunately the food isn't one. 

So the good--very cute and elegant place. Nice drinks. Friendly staff. Great music. Cozy fireplace. Friends liked the cream of mushroom soup and the curried lentil soup

And the bad--the menu \"du jour\" says July 2013. So you can see there's no thought or care behind the food. This played out.

The salmon I ordered was old! Definitely heading toward the rank side. The \"melted leeks\" that accompanied with it were just sautéed leeks, so a really poor menu description. 

 A friend ordered the steak frites. The fries were good, but the steak, ordered medium, came out medium well to well. The chicken that two other friends ordered was dried out. The creme brûlée was so bad, that two of us had to send it back. Note, I didn't send the old salmon back, so that should tell you how bad the creme brûlée was!

My girlfriend had the beet salad. Nothing inspired about it, but nothing wrong either. So, come here for some drinks, a salad, and good music. Leave a nice tip for the nice servers, but just eat your main meal before you get here. With that on my playbook, I will return."}
{"text":"While wandering around for a early dinner after a day of travel we stumbled upon Bon Vivant. The place was still empty as they prepared for the dinner service.  Service was quick and attentive by the hostess and chef (who were on duty at the time). Dinner options were well explained and some good suggestion to suit my wife's preferences.

The kale salad we started with was fresh with a variety of complementary flavours. Only discovered this as we were half way though since there was far too much lemon on top of the salad, still enjoyable nonetheless.

The mains were far more consistent. I had the BBQ ribs with polenta and cabbage, healthy portions served on a stone slab. The light kick offered up by BBQ sauce was well balanced by the sides. My wife had a goat ragu served in a seasonal squash.  It was well presented and the flavours were excellent. Overall quite an enjoyable meal.

The decor of the place was I guess what you could call industrial, lots of steel and wood surfaces.  The lighting was somewhat dim which gives a nice warm feeling to the space. Music was great but can't comment on the atmosphere since we were the only ones there at the time. 4.5 if I could."}
{"text":"Amaaaaazig, have t been to such a divine restaurant in a while. The food is so packed with flavor , came here by fluke and the owner Sebastian was beyond generous with his service and knowledge with a zest of life. The food-like wow wow wow, definitely would travel over seas to come here again the steak. The wine, desert. Like I'm salivating"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch. Friendly service and delicious food. What they call \"huevos rancheros\" is really nothing of the sort, but it was delicious anyway."}
{"text":"A second trip in 2 weeks. A different waitress who was as awesome as the one before. I had the chicken curry. It was sublime!"}
{"text":"Had a nice brunch on a Sunday at this cute little house-turned restaurant on Larchmere.  I had the Eggs Benedict with hash brown potato cubes and mimosas as a part of a pre fix menu.   The mimosa was great and the meal was just ok.  My hollandaise sauce lacked flavor, but it was still a great dining experience and I would return."}
{"text":"My food was served to me cold. The portion was very small and unfortunately it was blend and boring. I can't recommend this place and i won't return."}
{"text":"Just returned from outstanding brunch at BV. Started with 2 lattes, very tall, very good. Sister had huevos rancheros, a huge (burning hot!) cast iron skillet filled to the rim with eggs, spicy chorizo, potatoes, zesty tomato salsa, tortillas & guac on the side. My winning dish was on their off menu specials, a croissant split in 2 covered with cheese, topped with melt in your mouth pork belly & 2 perfectly fried eggs with runny yolks. The side salad of mesclun salad with nice vinaigrette really did cut the richness of the egg/pork/cheese/croissant. Service was excellent, our waiter was so nice & all the staff were friendly. Highly recommend this fun restaurant."}
{"text":"We were welcomed with warm smiles by the staff. Very friendly and welcoming. The food was absolutely delicious! Our group ordered a variety of dishes from appetizers to dessert and everyone was licking their fingers by the end. Casual but lively atmosphere. Perfect for a date night or dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Adore this little gem. It's been very \"under the radar\" since opening, and I'd be quite happy for it to stay that way. We've eaten both inside and on the lovely patio. Love everything we've tasted -- mushroom strudel, hanger stake, super mussels. A nice selection of French wines by the glass."}
{"text":"Great menu, almost always great service except for sometimes but it's rare. Food's always on time but to get someone to come around isn't always easy once you get your meal so make sure you ask for whatever you need at the beginning. Otherwise love this spot. Highly recommended. Dates, lunch, brunch, dinner, meal with friends. Worth the money."}
{"text":"Can't complain , was very good from service to food , price was $$$$ out of 5.
The apple crumble was awesome !! Will go back :)"}
{"text":"Bon vivant is the kind of place you walk in and feel immediately welcome. It's a small restaurant with lots of charms from the very cool decor to the smiles and service given by the staff topped off by delicious plates.  

We came to brunch and this I exactly the kind of setting I appreciate with open concept kitchen and hip music playing just the right level.  The service was very attentionate and the waitress did a really good job at describing the daily specials and making my mouth water. 

I had the croque madame,  one of their daily specials and it was absolutely divine.  The brioche bread they used,  the high quality ham,  the special béchamel Brie sauce,  every bite was a delight and the salad that came with it was a perfect addition. 

We also shared the French toast and this one comes in my top two of French toasts ever tried.  With its grand marnier flambé fruits and perfect balance of sweet and mushy,  it's a must have!

I will definitely be back to enjoy more of the delicious plates coming out of that kitchen and the pleasant atmosphere in which we were welcome."}
{"text":"We were very sad to see that Bon Vivant has closed its doors for good. Wish there was a way to report restaurant closings to Yelp..."}
{"text":"Bon petit Resto bar . Très bon choix de vins . Le service est excellent voir même ultra excellent . Les repas du jour varie selon la journée . J'enlève un étoile parce que le prix est un peu cher pour ce que c'est et il n'y a pas bcp de choix de plat à la carte . Je conseille quand même ! Ha oui ... C'est un des seuls Resto du genre dans le coin ouvert le dimanche soir ."}
{"text":"Great meal. Make reservations or come prepared to wait. Only 4 a tables and bar seating. Amazing meal and food prep performance. Get a seat at the bar. You will not regret it"}
{"text":"Food was expensive but fair for the ingredients, not quite for taste, which was sub par (we got an octopus dish, and a clam and muscles pizza). My main problem however was the tatted manager (or something similar, maybe the owner?) with the sleeves constantly harassing the female employees, rubbing their backs during conversation, and at one point sliding his hand over an employee's elbow. Very off putting, unprofessional, and kind of a gross vibe to see during a meal."}
{"text":"Everything was good but not great. 
The service was friendly and fast enough. 
The flavours were quite nice - we got fermier salad the Korean short ribs the tataki tuna and fish and chips. 
So why 3 stars? The quality of meat and fish were poor. The Korean short rib meat was the same cheap beef you'd expect to find in a fast food food court Asian restaurant. Dry and grisly. Even the part with fat attached to the bone was terribly chewy. The tuna although fresh was rubbery near the cooked exterior and far from melt in your mouth. 
I ordered the pinky as it was a house cocktail and it wasn't bad but wasn't exceptional either. 

The sauce and presentation were excellent. I'd be willing to pay 5-10$ more for my plate to have quality melt in your mouth meat and fish. Loved the decor- the lighting was lovely."}
{"text":"We were greeted so warmly on a chilly Saturday night. That's one plus among many about this delightful restaurant. A fairly good selection of wines by the glass to accompany our delicious food. We chose from the daily specials. Shared a superb appetizer of burrata, thin crisp aspargus spears, sitting on a bed of lovely Italian cured ham. Followed that with cavatelli with mushrooms, very good. My husband really enjoyed his vegetarian lasagna with Oka cheese - different and flavourful.  Portion size is reasonable, the vibe is hip, music is good and though lively, not too noisy that you can't have a conversation."}
{"text":"Tried a Sunday brunch. Original selections based on what is seasonal. Nice young hipster ambiance. Will return to try their supper menu and interesting  selection of beers. 

Choix très intéressant pour un brunch de dimanche avec des éléments de saison. Atmosphère conviviale de type hipster. Je vais y retourner pour essayer le menu du soir et les choix de bières."}
{"text":"Oh yum yum yum! We literally left this place five minutes ago and here I am writing a review so that I make sure that I don't forget anything!

We made a last minute decision today (Sat night) to go out for dinner and after seeing the good reviews, I called to see if we could get a table. The person who spoke to me on the phone was super flexible and said he'd make it happen. 40 minutes later we were seated at this cool industrial looking restaurant. The restaurant itself is super cozy (holds about 30-40 people max) and has a fun open kitchen where you can watch everything being prepared.

We asked for some appetizer recommendations and were instructed (really.. it was pretty amusing) to take the fried cauliflower/Brussels sprouts/halloumi dish as well as the short ribs. Because our server was very confident about these two, we obliged and I'm glad we did! The cauliflower dish was super interesting and the ribs were to die for.

For our mains, we ordered the rabbit (special of the day) and the cavatelli with burrata. Hubby liked the rabbit but said it wasn't outstanding, and the cavatelli was soooooo yummy like you wouldn't believe. Bathed in a delicious rosé sauce with onions and pancetta, this dish is smothered with melted burrata topped with a home made garlic pesto sauce. Need I say more? :p

At the end, despite us being pretty full, we decided to share a dessert and ended up with the key lime pie which was superb!

Overall, 4.75 stars (.25 off for the rabbit dish). Service is excellent, food is outstanding, and prices are ok ($140 for all the above plus two glasses of wine). Can't wait to be back!!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. The dishes are pretty good, but lacked a bit of spice in it. But they have very good spicy sauce you can ask for. The iced coffee is very smooth. The service is great. Just make sure u come a bit earlier to avoid line up."}
{"text":"I went to this charming little brasserie last week. It's cozy, and an EXCELLENT place for a glass of wine on a date. The food, not so much. I've been to France and understand the cuisine is different from American fare. I had the meatballs for an appetizer, they were too soft and bland. I then had the risotto and asparagus appetizer,  I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT. It was made like a crab cake.....anyway, the service and ambiance is wonderful."}
{"text":"Came back for a late weeknight dinner, after trying their brunch last year and loving it (the vietnamese spiked coffee is a must!). Dinner had a different vibe: dimly lit, cozy. Our server was attentive, patient, & warm. We listened to her recommendations for food & they did not disappoint. 2 of us shared the dumplings appetizer, the cauliflower appetizer, and the lamb shank. The cauliflower is a must; its flavorful & zesty, ive had fried cauliflower & fried haloumi before but theirs is unique. The lamb shank was cooked perfectly it was well seasoned, tender, & juicy. We each had a glass of wine. Our total was about $90. For Montreal, id say its a bit high but the food was delicious & i would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I had brunch a Sunday. The ambiance is nice and welcoming. The service was average, not good not bad.
Finally the food was tasty though I found was heavy, there were no vegetables or fruit that would have made it more balanced. 
In summary, instead of coming back, I rather prefer to experiment with other places."}
{"text":"After being kicked out of quoi d'noeuf (called to make a reservation then got there I got told they don't take reservations!? Don't go there if you want poor service! ) we ended up at bon vivant for brunch. 

Service was very courteous. They seemed to be busier than usual (it was thanksgiving monday) so our waiter apologized for any delay with the food and even offered us our first order of coffee (and they were all specialized coffee like lattes and cappuccinos). 

Overall the food was good. It was brunch so eggs and croissant, hard to miss but good portions. All in all I'd go back to try it for lunch or dinner for sure.  Nice décor as well and looks like they have a cute terrasse for those nice summer days."}
{"text":"Amazing spot, relaxed ambiance. My wife & I came with our young baby and the staff Was very Nice with us, our waiter allesandro gave us à great & Quick service .
The food Was delicious !! 10/10"}
{"text":"Back in Montreal.... Loving this place.  Its small, so call for reservations.  Unique menu, so ask questions when ordering, the staff is very helpful.  I had two appetizers and a main meal.  Obviously I ordered too much.  I stared with the chief suggestion, which was a bone marrow appetizer with a egg on it. I was blown away.  I also had the short ribs, Nicely prepared.   

Only thing that can be improved was service, but it's \" Montreal\".  

My date had the burger, was average compared to what else is on the menu."}
{"text":"Okay, you have to go to Bon Vivant. No, really. Go! 

I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon mostly by accident with my girlfran Habby. Oh Em Gee, this place is super ADORBS. (look at the photos!) It's located in an old, renovated house that was once Vine and Bean. Super charming.

The menu is French and everything we tasted was delicious. We both ordered a frisee salad and panini sandwiches. That salad was superb and I'd absolutely order it again. It's worth noting that there are more than a few options on the menu for vegetarians. 

Service was very friendly. Even better, I asked for a mimosa and they weren't able to make it for me at that exact moment due to not having champagne at the time. They were able to make it a bit later and gave it to me on the house. Very nice! 

The interior is rather small so it's not appropriate for larger groups. This is a perfect little spot for a date though! 

I'd love to come back in the summer to sit on their patio for dinner."}
{"text":"I ordered the comeback burger & was exceptionally pleased. Very delicious and fresh!! 

If you are in little burgundy, this is the best place to take your friends."}
{"text":"Went there recently with friends for a casual dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Good selection of specials as well as a la carte dishes. The portions are very much a plus and the taste - deelish!

Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This was my first time in this restaurant and we loved it. We looked at the menu several times as all the choices sounded delicious and finally we ended up choosing the specials: Bahn Minh and clams. The dishes were entree size but they were to die for. 
The banh minh came with a salad while the clams cmae with 2 thick toasts. It filled us up quite quickly. 
The service was friendly and efficient. The maitre d'hote (maybe he was the owner) quickly found us a spot where to seat as we hadnt made a reservation. Our waiter knowledge and attentiveness was highly appreciated. 
We will for sure go back to taste more dishes."}
{"text":"I can't comment on dinner, but we had a great lunch here during our trip to Montreal. 

We grabbed a couple seats at the bar towards the back end of the restaurant, which ended up being quite close to the open kitchen. Hopefully the chef doesn't get annoyed when people sit there, but we had a fun time watching him work his magic. We kept changing our mind on what to order as things appeared from the kitchen, all looking incredible.

That's how we arrived at the bacon burger, which mind you, is stacked with much more than that and was superb. We also had the polenta and meatballs, which were also outstanding and some sort of salad that's faded from memory with all the meat we ate. What I am still dreaming about however, is the Chou-Fleur Frit. Fried brussels? Almost always great, fried cauliflower the same, but those two combined with fried halloumi in a bed of yogurt and hummus?? The best. If I'm being honest, I could just eat the fried halloumi with the various dippings forever, but it was nicely balanced with the vegetables. 

Our waiter/server/just all around personable guy Alesandro (think I have that correct) was top notch as well. Excellent detail about anything on the menu, happy to chat with us about Montreal (on our first day in town). I hear that Montreal is a service industry down and the standard is high, but even if that is the case, Alesandro was above and beyond. 

A cozy, delicious place for lunch and we would certainly return if in Montreal again. Well worth your time."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times and the food was always good. There was one time I didn't like what I ordered but that's my own fault. I should have known calamari ( not breaded) in a taco wouldn't be tasty. Other than that, amazing food! A bit pricey for the amount of food you get but the quality is outstanding. The staff is always polite and inviting. Great place to celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"This is a great spot. Open for lunch and dinner, the specials are constantly updated. While some plates are unspectacular, the diversity in the menu means you wont have trouble finding a delicious option. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Well, isn't this just the cutest little place!

Formerly Vine & Bean...

Happened upon Bon Vivant while strolling along Larchmere with my gal, Stef C. Needed some lunch... this looks cute... let's go... wow!!!

Extremely intimate, the two dining areas are only as big as two rooms in your average house...because well, it IS a house. They converted the first floor of an old house into the cutest french restaurant. They could do with some better signage...we weren't sure WHERE it was. The only indication is the side of the building next to it, where it says the name.

I had the Frisee Salad with poached egg and bacon lardons. Perfect! Oh how I love this salad and they nailed it. Light vinaigrette, smoky crispy bacon...mmm
I also had a sandwich with ham....can't remember the name. It was really tasty with grainy mustard and swiss. 

This place would make a PERFECT date night. So romantic, cozy and reasonably priced for French."}
{"text":"went for brunch, right when they opened. no wait yet.
very cute place. live pianist! playing really pretty cute things! the songs sounded french. one of them was the pink panther theme, but i don't think that's french.
anyway, lunch is prix fixe menu. $15 for an entree and a drink. drink choices include bloody mary and mimosa. the best thing about the meal was the mimosa that i got. i also ordered the tofu scramble. it was super bland. i salt and peppered it, and i never put salt on anything usually! i also put ketchup and tabasco. it was edible.
maybe their other items were better. i'll give this place one more shot at dinner or something but not brunch. for the price, i expected the food to be a lot better. the decor and ambiance made up for it. almost.
also, our waitress was nice enough, but super awkward, got our order mixed up, and overall just wasn't quite sure what to do with herself. it was weird. i think she spilled all our drinks before she came out, because we heard a crash of glassware as she was about to come out. mimosa was good though. good coffee too."}
{"text":"This is a very, very cute French restaurant. Ambiance is wonderful with great fun French music and decor, but unfortunately that's sorta where the good stuff ends. 

Across the board food was pretty average. Nothing was really special and most dishes were not prepared well. For example, the sauce in my husband's beef dish tasted like raw, uncooked alcohol and my steak was overdone. Our server was nice, but new so I can excuse her for not knowing what was in dishes and for forgetting to bring out our bread. 

As a whole this is a really cute place, but the food needs to get better. I'd come back for drinks, but not to eat."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! I came here on a first date on a Thursday night and it was really a success. The place has a great ambiance and a special decor that gives it a hip but yet casual feel to the place. All our food choices were excellent and the service was great. Definately coming back here again!! Love the combinations of ingredients and everything tasted so fresh."}
{"text":"Belle découverte ! Nous y sommes allés pour fêter les 30 ans d'une amie vendredi soir. Pour cette occasion, nous avons eu des plats à partager en 5 services et avec la possibilités d'avoir des modifications. Les portions sont généreuses et la nourriture vraiment bonne. Le service a été impeccable et les serveuses à notre écoute. 
Seul bémol à noter, le renard empaillé dans la salle de bain !"}
{"text":"First off, you NEED to make a reservation either directly calling them or by online. The place is noticeably small and although we reserved for two our table was in the way of the entrance in which we were offered to be relocated at the kitchen counter /bar. Because it was cold near entrance, we accepted. 

The food is pretty good. We started off with the assorted charcuterie accompanied by a beet salad. Portions are good for 2, even three. The charcuterie was pretty good which included in-house curated prosciutto aged 1 year. I hear that was their best entree so we went for it. Solid variety and well worth it. 

Main meals wise, I ordered the tandoori chicken on quinoa garnish. One thigh and two thick chicken legs. Plenty of food but my only complaint was that it was cold as if it had been waiting. My companion went with the Colcannon and looked delicious. Both plates are can't miss. 

Overall, will go back. Cool atmosphere and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"We had brunch here and were a bit disappointed. The restaurant has a cool vibe, very industrial. The menu is small, but they have a nice selection of daily specials. The hueverous rancheros were good -4star. The eggs and potatoes were okay. The toast that came with it was cold and dry. The butter was hard and cold. Lattes were good."}
{"text":"It's been a very long time since I've been this excited about good food. This place is fantastic ! Very creative and tasteful food. Really loved it !"}
{"text":"A quaint repurposed house that has a warm and inviting interior with rich wood and a cozy fireplace.  A very respectable French menu with very traditional offerings and a  lovely and talented bartender make this one worth a visit.

{"text":"Le Bon Vivant is good but it doesn't hit it for me anymore. I find it's always just missing a little touch of authenticity - don't get me wrong the food is yummy and the vibes are great however I'm no longer lingering on my last meal I had at the BV"}
{"text":"Chill crowd, good vibe, super friendly service. You have to check out the washroom decors. Decided to go for the French toast on the brunch menu. Its very good but but I think maple syrup goes better with French toast rather than whipped cream and condensed milk. Would certainly go back again for its brunch!"}
{"text":"This is suppose to be a comfort food breakfast place but it's very heavy and not much flavor.

We had the Taco, breakfast bowel and croissant.
Taco was not well done so it's very hard to eat.
Breakfast bowel was okay but felt like a mash.
Croissant had smoked pork that was cold compared to everything else."}
{"text":"We randomly walked in with no reservations and the owner so kindly found us seats at the bar. Very thankful as we were starving. Everything we had was very delicious and unique. Ordered the Brussel sprouts, mussels, and octopus. Cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. We saved room for dessert and very glad we did as the apple crumble was excellent. All around great food, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"We had such a wonderful time here last night! Usually I'm one to check out the whole menu online and pick out my meal before even getting to the restaurant, but was unable to find Bon Vivant's menu anywhere. It worked out just fine.

We made an 8 PM reservation and it was a beautiful night, so we sat outside.  There was live music inside that began shortly after we arrived, and flowed out on the porch through the open windows and door. 

The wine menu was about 3 times longer than the food menu, which I loved.  There were a couple soups, a salad, and maybe 4 entrees and thats really all you needed.  We ordered a french onion soup (which was delicious), and the pear, walnut, and goat cheese arugula salad (good, standard) to start. For entrees we went with the chicken paillard and a mushroom ravioli.  The chicken was perfectly cooked, very moist and flavorful.  It came with a side of brussel sprouts that I believe were steamed and tossed with vinegar- not my favorite preparation of one of my favorite vegetables.  The mushroom ravioli were the special for the evening and were delicious- so flavorful and melted in your mouth.  All entrees were under $20, but for those expecting huge portions, be warned this is not that kind of place.  For dessert we ordered the cinnamon and vanilla creme brulee. It was good but not great, it felt as though it weren't freshly made, and the top was a bit underscorched. 

We took our time and the waitress was not pushy as we relaxed, enjoyed the weather and the music and our bottle of wine.  When it started downpouring as we finished our dessert, they helped us quickly move to a covered porch spot where we watched the rain fall around us.  We later went inside to watch the band (a guitarist and drummer) as we finished our last glasses of wine, and the vibe inside was so nice too. I really felt like we were transported to Paris for the night.

The ambiance at Bon Vivant can't be beat.  The food is simple, and very good. We will definitely be back!"}

Make a reservation and go maintenant!

It's a tiny spot so filled with love
And service that goes beyond and above

A thoughtful wine list and I so adore
That by the glass it's served free pour

The price is up there, I won't lie
But portions are hefty to both stomach and eye 

This place became an instant fave
Almost every night i get a crave 

The Yakuza Fries are a must have delight
The kimchi and cheese are out of sight!

Cavatelli with mushroom is to die for
With a creamy sauce and mushrooms galore

The stuffed cornish hen was not as great
But the roasted veggies it came with saved that plate

Even the leftovers I took home and reheated
Were as good, if not better, as when we were seated 

My first time but definitely not my last
I loved the experience, so chill with such class

I came here with one of my best friends. He had raved about it several times and we decided spur of the moment while we were at the Lion to book a table at Bon Vivant for an hour later (booked at 6pm for 7pm on a Thursday evening). The place is quite tiny so I do recommend making a reservation, it was full by the time we left at 9ish. 

Service was amazing (and the staff are damnnnn fine to look at), the food was 4.5/5* perfection (the cornish hen was stuffed with Tourtière which sounded insatiable but the execution was not quite as tantalizing, the hen was a bit dry and there wasn't enough stuffing). The wine options were perfect. I'm giving it the 5 stars it deserves!

I can't wait to go back! A must check out for sure!"}
{"text":"First a note: I'm giving this place four stars because I need to leave room for an extra star just in case I come across somewhere that is truly amazing. That being said, Bon Vivant is well deserving of its four stars. We went there for late Sunday brunch and ordered the huevos rancheros and one of the specials - a meatloaf slice in a half bagel with tomato and greens on top. Both were well made, very tasty and a good blend of flavours in each. A couple of coffees rounded off the meal. 

The restaurant itself is small which lends itself to a bustling atmosphere even when it isn't packed. The staff is friendly and attentive. The brunch menu is not the most varied you're ever going to see but for me I'd prefer restaurants that make a few things really well rather than many things poorly. We're definitely going to come back to see what else they can create out of their tiny kitchen."}
{"text":"L'intérieur est accueillant, on peut soit manger au bar ou plus classiquement sur une table. Il y a même 2 tables dehors pour ceux qui ne peuvent vivre sans soleil mais attention aucune ombre ;)
L'accueil est rapide et convivial et on est assis rapidement pour un brunch de fin de semaine. 
Au niveau du menu c'est des choses qui changent un peu sur le brunch, mon choix se jette sur un Shakchuka (saucisse merguez, feta, oeuf, sauce tomate au cumin, germinate & pita grillé). C'était vraiment très bon et les autres plats qui passent semblent tous aussi appétissant :)
Le service est parfois un peu hasardeux notamment lorsque j'ai demandé des pitas en plus et que l'on m'a rapporté des tortillas ! Ajouté à cela le service un peu lent mais au moins sympathique.
Si vous souhaitez bruncher à coté du marché vos pouvez venir dans cet endroit car on y mange bien, je me le garde dans le coin de la tête pour une prochaine fois !"}
{"text":"I haven't gone here for food yet, so I'll update this one I do.

Went here to grab drinks from some friends and we loved this place! I remember when it used to be Vine and Bean, immediately when I walked in I said \"Whoa.\" It looks really different and makes such a great date spot! The owner greeted us when we got there, and the staff was super friendly as well.  They had a nice fire going on this cold night and it definitely had a more intimate, romantic feel to it.  All the drinks were really good too--tasty and just strong enough =) and they have a full bar.  Definitely planning to come back here again soon!"}
{"text":"I went to Bon Vivant a couple of days ago. The food was wonderful and the menu has been completely revamped. Rather than the large more confused menu this menu is smaller but much more French. We had a charcuterie plate as an appetizer which was nice.

I got Steak Frites which was wonderful. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and the fired were nice too. My girlfriend got raviolis stuffed with goat cheese and mushrooms topped with a slightly spicy jam, all on a bed of pea puree. Although not very French it was crazy creative and uniquely delicious.  

I think there is a new chef running the kitchen and he is pumping out some great dishes.

Like everyone else said the decor and setting was great. We sat on the back patio. As we were leaving we ended up chit chatting with the owner of the building who told us that they are going to renovate the garage in the back and turn it into a bar.

I can't wait to get back to Bon Vivant."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Saturday at 10am. Didn't need reservation, however it became very packed around noon. Great decor, and very friendly staff. 

The food is standard good quality brunch leaning a little on the heavy side, with many of the plates including meat. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent; le proprietaire et notre serveur etaient tres accueillant et nos repas etaient excellents.  Pas cher."}
{"text":"Dropped by after enjoying some happy hour cocktails down the street at Felice. I had no idea what to expect because Bon Vivant doesn't have a menu posted online (?!?!) and I hadn't been in the space since it was Vine and Beans years and years ago.

The restaurant is set in the first floor of a big old house so there are lots of nooks and crannies. There was a small bar area where we sat and a bunch of tables set up in multiple rooms.

Since it was derby weekend, I tried to order a mint julep off of the picture drink menu. But, alas, they were out of mint. I got a margarita instead and it was ok. I've become a bit of a fresh fruit in my margarita snob, so excuse me for turning my nose up at a margarita mix.

We were only planning on staying for a drink but I looked over the menu and saw multiple vegan options! Multiple! I attempted to order a tofu appetizer...but they were out of that, too. I ordered a white bean crostini appetizer instead. It wasn't the best appetizer I've ever had, but it wasn't the worst, either. If we'd had more time, I definitely would have stayed and tried one of the other vegan options on the menu. 

I only deducted a couple stars because there's no online menu and they were out of a couple things I wanted. I'd definitely like to go back and try more of the drinks and food."}
{"text":"This review is for the brunch!

Bon Vivant is a very cute place on Larchmere, but it's very poorly labeled (actually, the building next to it is labeled with \"Bon Vivant\") and it looks like a house like many places on Larchmere do, so we nearly couldn't find it.

For the prix-fixe price of $15 on weekends, bon vivant offers brunch.  Includes entree, fruit cup (+ whipped cream) and drink.  The entrees include things like an omelette (which we found not particularly special), eggs benedicts (I had the salmon eggs benedict - that was delicious!) and couple other dishes.  The drinks include mimosas, and things like orange juice, soda, milk, coffee, etc.  Since the menu has a prix-fixe price, certain things (benedict+mimosa) are very good deals, and certain other things (eggs+milk) are terrible deals.  All-in-all, pretty tasty though.  We'll probably be back."}
{"text":"J'étais agréablement surprise de la qualité, de l'ambiance et le très bon service que nous avons reçus. Franchement c'était un pur hasard parce que normalement on devant aller à un autre restaurant mais nous avons fini par découvrir ce restaurant très chaleureux. J'étais contente de le découvrir, certainement je reviendrai et je le recommanderai sans hésitation. 

J'ai commandé le plat tunisien suite à la recommandation de la serveuse qui est une chakchouka tunisienne avec des merguez agneau et ufs miroirs et bien sur le délicieux pain perdu."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! The brunch is amazing. The eggs Benedict is perfection and has ruined me from ordering it anywhere else."}
{"text":"Good spot for a casual night out. Ambiance is laid back and focused on conviviality. 

The menu is quite varied and has hints of Asian flair with items such as Korean ribs, Kimchee salads as well as more classic Italian dishes. We stuck more with the Italian side for our evening. 

The major plus side of this place is that portions are huge! We ordered the antipasti appetizer and we're blown away at the size of burrata we were served! Not the best burrata we've ever had but it definitely hit the spot when the cream oozed out of the mozzarella exterior! 

Mains were also extremely generous is portions. However, lacked flavour. I ordered the veal oscobucco and was a bit disappointed as the meat itself was engulfed by the massive amount of sauce and potatoes it bathed in. The veal was decent when I dug it out of the potatoes but wasn't anything special. My boyfriend ordered the chicken jerk style and was disappointed in the lack of jerk seasoning. It was quite soft on the Caribbean flair, but the cool of the chicken was spot on. 

Overall, a very enjoyable evening. Tip: If you are two, sit in front of the bar facing the kitchen as you'll get to enjoy watching the chefs create their copious dishes while being closer to your date ;)"}
{"text":"J'ai pris mon temps avant d'écrire mon avis, je veux vraiment être objective. Nous sommes allés par hasard au Bon vivant avec un couple d'amis qui venaient visiter Montreal, ils avaient mangé un lunch assez tard  et n'avaient pas super faim, donc on s'est arrêté au Bon vivant pour des snacks. Nous n'avions pas fait de réservation, le restaurant avait l'air assez rempli mais nous avons été installés tout de suite. Je dois dire que le service a été extraordinaire tout le long de la soiree. Nous avons chacun pris un verre puis avons décidé de se partager quatre snack, le chou-fleur, les dumplings, les ribs coréen et le chorizo/humous.  J'ai mis une photo pour complémenter mon avis, mais nous avons été assez surpris, les portions sont assez petites, surtout pour le chou-fleur et les ribs. Je sais que c'est des snacks mais avoir trois petits bout de chou-fleur qui se battent en duels dans une grande d'assiettes c'est assez triste. Outre ça, tout étais très bon. Pour conclure le \"repas\" la serveuse nous a conseillé la tarte à la lime faite sur place accompagnée de bleuets sauvages très bon conseil nous en avons pris deux et ce fut divin! Contrairement au snack, les portions de dessert sont plus que généreuses, la tarte était parfaite, ni trop sucrée ni trop acide. Nous sommes partis le ventre plein et sourire aux lèvres (grâce au dessert). Mais la note fut comme même salée (comme vous pouvez le voir sur une de mes photos), le prix de snack est bien trop élevé à mon opinion pour les portions reçu. Quand même une belle découverte, allez-y pour fêter quelque chose."}
{"text":"Though a little pricey and the wait can be long for lunch if there are lots of customers when walking jn the door, we were glad to try this place. Servers were very helpful.
1. Kale salad-liked the dressing and crearive addition of nori. I will b adding nori to my salads at home in the future. Added tender, tasty pieces of chicken.
2. Roast Beef Poutine- flavor was great. Not too salty. Roast beef, cheese curds and fries melted in my mouth."}
{"text":"Great dinner spot. Affordable. Delicious food cooked in an open kitchen. Good variety on the menu as well. 
Specials of the day are usually interesting and tasty. If you like IPAs get the Kissmeyer Nordic Pale Ale. Music and ambiance is usually good but can sometimes be a little off. 
Overall. Have a had great service and great food at this spot. Recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday at 11:30ish.
Great friendly service,Tatianna (did I spell that correctly... probably not. Sorrry!!) 
Was super friendly, nice and very attentive. 
Everyone else was also very friendly and present. 

Food was delicious, 
Mimosa and bloody ceaser were great!

Beautiful decor and really nice open kitchen."}
{"text":"This place is delicious every time I come. Last time I had the shakshuka eggs and was debating to have the huevos rancheros instead. This time I did and now I don't know which one I like more. See the pics of the huevos and the latte."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant digne des plus grands!
Les portions des plats principaux sont peut être un peu légères mais avec une assiette de fromage et deux desserts partagés pour trois,nous avons pu apprécier !
L'accueil y est excellent et agréable 
A conseiller pour soirées entre amis pub\"date\""}
{"text":"Saturday brunch did not disappoint. 

Beautiful decor inside but we ate on the front porch. Great people watching from there. Pretty quiet neighborhood. 

They have a fixed price menu, so for $15 you get your choice of dish plus a drink. Free refills on coffee and juice but not on bloody mary's or mimosas. I had eggs Benedict, which also came with breakfast potatoes. Both were excellent. And our waitress was very nice and efficient. 

In conclusion, a little pricey for the quantity of food you get but a fair deal for the taste and for the ambience."}
{"text":"Nnnnnnnnngggggggggg!!!!!

If stomachs couldn't tell you when they were full, I would probably die of overeating at Le Bon Vivant. Is that even possible? I dunno, it could be. If you want to give it a try, this is where you should go. 

Every bite was better than the last. How is that even possible? Is there a wizard casting delicious patronum spells in the kitchen? Do they use enchanted meats? This place boggles the mind.  

This is what I ate. You should also eat it:

- Vietnamese octopus: holy shit
- Yakuza fries: holy shit
- Fried trout: holy shit
- Aged rib steak: holy fucking shit
- New York steak: see above
- Kale salad: even their vegetables are fucking amazing

I honestly don't know why you're not here now. Get in a cab, or an Uber, or jump on a bus, I don't care how you get here, but you need to go here now. 

Update: We ordered dessert. I am literally dead. How am I writing this if I'm dead. Ghost writing."}
{"text":"I came here with my sister for brunch and I will say the food is good but a bit too fat for me. The place is cool and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Atmosphere agréable. Beau menu. Assiettes goûteuses et généreuses. Le service par contre n'était pas à la hauteur des plats; un peu rustre. En plus, le serveur a apporté mon Sancerre au cabaret. J'aurais préféré voir la bouteille et me faire servir mon verre à la table. Chose que j'ai vu le serveur faire a toutes les tables sauf la notre. Un peu étrange. J'y retournerais mais en espérant un meilleur service."}
{"text":"Trust me, this place is amazing. Yakuza fries are considered as snacks? When the bucket of kimchi, fries and cheese landed on the table I expected half of the buckle to be hollow. You know when you get a sad ice cream and the bottom half of the cone doesn't contain anything? This isn't the case for the Yakuza fries. The whole bucket is full of perfect Netflix snack all the way to the bottom. What a great start!

That was good but what about their recommendation of grilled octopus? Smoky and perfectly tender - one of the best I've ever had. It doesn't stop there. That gaspor bacon burger... I want a framed picture of it on the wall of my room. Everytime I order a burger in a restaurant it always end up as a disappointment. That's speaking for even the good burger places ranked high on Yelp. The quality for price ratio is always low until I was hit by the unexpected. Le Bon Vivant holds the human version of Krabby Patty. Go there to try it for yourself -  I won't spoil anything. 

The food quality is gold. That burger makes me high. No lie."}
{"text":"Muh... the store is very small and we were accommodated at two seats right by the washroom... the food was okay but not much comment on the service. We got ribs as starter and two entree and two chocolaty dessert. Two entrees were salmon and duck leg. Total was around 130. The duck leg and the starter was overcooked and part of it was black. The salmon I thought is cooked and ended up as a sashimi. The dessert was good and looked nice. Considering the overall price I'd say there must be better alternatives."}
{"text":"Brunch sortant de l'ordinaire avec une belle touche gastronomique.
Jolie place avec vue sur les cuisine."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and reasonably priced. The only issue is that the portions are on the smaller side and if you are hungry, you will definitely want to order an appetizer, main course and dessert. 

We tried their cauliflower and haloumi appetizer, kalbi ribs and octopus mains and creme brulee. All were cooked to perfection! I really wish that my kalbi ribs came with a small bowl of white rice and kimchi on the side!
I would happily return to eat with friends again."}
{"text":"Great space and the owners are very friendly and fun!  I can't wait to try dinner there!"}
{"text":"Attentive service. Great wine list. Vegan friendly, great selection seafood, meat and more. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My partner and I visited one Sunday morning for a late brunch. Side-eyeing the dull sandwiches and salads at the table adjacent, he and I opted for the huevos rancheros and roast beef poutine, respectively. My poutine was quite the disappointment, with a gravy that was somehow underseasoned yet far too thick, and flecks of house-roasted beef too obscure to be appreciated. My partner's huevos rancheros fared no better, with pools of grease nestled into a tomato sauce that lacked any nuance beyond the mild heat from Mexican chili powder. Perhaps the most glaring fault of the dish, however, were the uncooked egg whites he discovered at the bottom of his EGG-based dish. This was surprising given that both dishes took what felt like an eternity to arrive, so you'd think they would've used more of that time to cook their eggs all the way through. Now, I recognize brunch is generally an ill-fated meal, but I still don't think that's much of an excuse for a business to underperform. Sorry to say this was another one of those restos that seems to value style or service."}
{"text":"Restaurant cozy avec staff super chaleureux. Je suis rentrée diner tranquille et je suis repartie en ayant trinqué dix fois avec le patron (ancien joueur de rugby, donc forcément chaleureux et vivant). On se sent comme à la maison avec des copains là bas. Risotto superbe, pates aux fruits de mer superbes, desserts excellents. Allez seul petit point dirai-je: pkoi avoir changé de pain ? Il était bien meilleur avant :D ;)"}
{"text":"Good new spot on Notre Dame, it's casual and has good food. Their Salad of the market is amazing!!! Their tacos are awesome. The service was pleasant."}
{"text":"When I arrived, I entered and a woman standing by the door said \"hi\".  I said \"hi\" back and waited for the hostess.  I waited....then that same woman mumbled something I didn't understand so I smiled and nodded.  I waited some more...then the woman came toward me.  I asked her \"Do you Work here?\"  She said yes, I'm the hostess???   
     First of all, I ordered the porterhouse chop and it was raw inside, not pink.  It was red, cold, bloody raw.  Aside from it being raw, the \"apple chutney\" was gross, bland and the horseradish mashed potatoes were bland as well.  The plating was flat and everything was the same color except for the green beans which were nice.  
      Second, I ordered what I thought was a small meat & cheese board.  However it was just a small meat board, no cheese.  The meat was nothing to rave about.
      Thirdly, the hostess keep reaching over our table and messing with the dimmer switch, asking \"Is this better, Is this better, Is this better, ......\"  
      The interior was designed with a lot of care and thoughtfulness however, it's strange and very very small.  
      The owners are extremely nice and I'd love to see them succeed but they need to get back to basics.  
      One star for the waitress and one star for the cleanliness."}
{"text":"Near the intersection of Atwater and Notre Dame, Bon Vivant might as well be at the intersection of good food, great service, and great value. 

This review comes with a disclaimer,  I've been twice and ordered the same thing both times, the huevos rancheros. The next time we go back I'll probably be ordering it again... because its awesome. The coffee was also excellent. 

The service deserves mention as well, it was timely and atypically friendly without being overbearing or forced. 

Service: Great, Food: Good, and I was totally happy with my bill when it arrived :)

I'll be going back, likely soon."}
{"text":"Went for brunch with a couple friends. First walking in the place is really cool with the raw wood, iron, and Edison bulb vibe going on. We sat up at the kitchen bar which is always the best in my opinion to watch the cook. We got the berry and green smoothies, nothing special, basic smoothie you can make at home. I went with the benie BLT, eggs Benedict with bacon, tomato, turkey. It was one of the best Benedict's I've had. They smoke their own meats so the turkey and bacon had the right amount of smoke, not to over powering. Poached egg done perfectly, which sounds like a given but you'd be surprised at how many places do it so poorly. The hollandaise was classic, nothing crazy, done right. The other two guy got a basic eggs, bacon, potato dish and the club, they said they were really good, especially the potatoes. Everything else we saw coming out of the kitchen looked great. Didn't get any mimosas or bloody's but they all sounded good.  Overall, solid place for brunch."}
