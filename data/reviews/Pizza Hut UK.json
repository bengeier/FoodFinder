{"text":"Nice place with friendly staff. The buffet offer is good. It can get very busy but a bit of patience when waiting for the bill helps.    The Pizzas can be a little greasy but this seems to be typical across the chain"}
{"text":"Unlikely to win any awards but this is not what a Pizza Hut is there for, they stand for quick calorific food served with a Peroni more elegance than a fast food vendor but a wine choice less than a Pizza Express. In Scarborough you will be hard pressed to find any of the more noteworthy establishments open for a lunch time service. This of course plays into Pizza Hut's hands. Although exceedingly busy the staff are well motivated and tick all the boxes. I choose four stars because the staff although swamped with custom have a sense of urgency whilst maintaing a slight personal touch. This is more than less family orientated Italian chains such as ASK can claim and for such a location you can forgive easily any waiting you may endure. I would like to see more competition in the high street in this town to really show a comparison."}
{"text":"Generally, I think you know what to expect from Pizza Hut, just as you do with most chains. If its your kind of thing - and especially if you have children - then you'll probably go back time and time again. If its not your kind of thing, chances are you'll avoid it.    Pizza Hut actually isnt bad at all, and this branch is no exception to that. Its always been one of the more reasonably priced family restaurants - their all you can eat buffets in particular seem to have been around for years - and you're usually certain of getting a good meal.    Like everywhere else in the town, its stupidly busy in season and occasionally at weekends, but its also the kind of place you never really have to wait long to get a table. Its very family friendly, and the menu tends to offer something for anyone, from pizza to pasta, which is always tasty if occasionally a little on the ordinary side. The service is always friendly and unhurried and its certainly a place which warrants repeat custom."}
{"text":"Great staff! Very friendly and helpful. Food is always excellent, especially the salad bar, which is very good for vegetarians and people dieting.   Drinks are a little over priced, but with the unlimited refills, Â£2.15 for a Pepsi could be well worth it.   The restaurant is often very crowded, especially around 6:30pm. Pizza Hut is popular with the kids, so if you're not up for hearing children's high pitched laughs and squeals, this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"When you go to Pizza Hut you know what you're going to get.it does what it says on the tin so to speak! Lunchtime buffet is great value, staff are friendly. It's an all time family favourite for many people. There is always a queue to get in during the summer when the town is full of holidaymakers, so I tend to give it a wide berth until the end of the season when it's much quieter. My son and his friends go regularly, many times when they have ordered their individual pizzas the waitress has come back to them to say they are out of individual bases so they end up with a larger pizza each for the same price so they come out very happy indeed!!"}
{"text":"This particular franchise is, as Himself, and I were told, owned by an American who has taken Parmesan cheese our of the restaurant. Being an American, I looked at my husband and said, I want to see his credentials.   And if you are American, you'll be less than suitably impressed by some of what's offered for the salad buffet. You have a fine selection of salad dressings, but many of the items we associate with a good salad aren't there.   The pizza isn't bad, but it's nothing to rave about either."}
