{"text":"We were told that this was something new that they were trying out. A roasted turkey wrap with swiss cheese, almonds and dried cranberries. Almost a pseudo turkey dinner wrap, this \"sandwich\" was held together with a soft wholewheat tortilla. Again, roasted right in the store, the turkey was still juicy and full of flavour and was really nice with the nuttiness of the almonds and the sweetness of the cranberries. Third sandwich in, it was very apparent that Soupson's sandwich and lunch vision is to provide really solid and simple meals - which is very commendable."}
{"text":"The soup are alway delish.  I personally enjoy the Mexican wrap."}
{"text":"Offers exceptionally tasty  soups, sandwiches, wraps, and specialty foods to eat in or take out. Also sells a good assortment of grocery foods. The space is very clean, bright, open, and comfortable. I really enjoyed my flavourful meal and will go back for more!"}
{"text":"I love Soupson. For a long time, it was just part of the backdrop on my walks in the Mile-Ex but now it has become a regular stop for me when I am in the area thanks to my friend telling me to check out.  The owner is incredibly friendly and always let's you taste the soup even if you're coming in for something else. Every day she prepares a fresh batch, always vegan, with a cashew cream or sunflower cream base. It's always delicious and I've never been disappointed. On the weekends, they have chilli (vegan and meat) that I haven't tried yet but I've heard are good. Not feeling soup or chilli? Their fridge are always full of salad, sandwiches and wraps. They also carry delicious cookies and on Tuesdays and Fridays they get Saint Donuts (I'm kinda obsessed with those donuts.) You can also stay in to eat or take it away.  The great thing about Soupson is that it's also a mini grocer and they carry fresh produce. It's your one stop shop for your dep-grocery-restaurant needs.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"At $4 (tax included), this is incredible value for a large, delicious banh mi. I also enjoyed the ice coffee. Came right at noon, but as I was leaving, a long line. Still, it moves quite quickly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ho Wow! Petite place sans prétention où déguster une savoureuse soupe, un sandwich végé et une salade. 3 places à la fenêtre et 14 places à la grande table pour manger à l'intérieur. D'une simplicité tellement Wow que j'ai l'impression d'être à l'autre bout du monde."}
{"text":"Le marché Soupson c'est tout simplement devenu ma cantine attitrée !  A deux pas de mon boulot, niché dans le Mile-Ex cette petite épicerie propose aussi de quoi se restaurer, sur place ou à emporter avec comme spécialité des soupes.  Et quelles soupes ! A chaque jour sa recette, et je dois dire que je n'ai encore jamais été déçu (le menu de la semaine est consultable en ligne) avec une mention spéciale pour la champignon, riz sauvage et poireaux, une tuerie.  Sont aussi à disposition Wraps, sandwichs, cookies et autres muffins, tout aussi bon que les soupes. Bref au marché Soupson rien n'est à jeter.  Vous rajoutez à ça l'accueil toujours chaleureux et la possibilité de faire remplir de beaux bocaux pour ramener une bonne soupe à la maison et vous obtenez un 5 étoiles amplement mérité !"}
{"text":"Been coming here since they first opened in their other location. I'm always satisfied! Here you can find a fresh, seasonal soup everyday (each weekday, it's a different soup and on the weekends, they have chili) as well as light lunch options such as salads, sandwiches and recently some prepared meals. Service is always courteous. I have met the owner and her mother on several occasions and they were very warm and welcoming. The pea soup and cream of mushroom soups are to die for!"}
{"text":"Un petit bijou du Mile-Ex, le marché Soupson vaut absolument le détour. C'est à la fois un petit marché hétéroclite où on peut acheter bière, bonbon, grignotines et fruits/légumes (attention, les prix sont plus élevés qu'ailleurs) et un comptoir à sandwiches et à soupes parfait pour le lunch.  Les soupes sont fabuleusement incroyables, je ne comprends pas comment la sympathique propriétaire arrive à en concocter d'aussi délicieuses. Moi, les soupes, j'en ai rien à cirer d'habitude, mais je fais régulièrement exception quand je fais me chercher de quoi me sustenter au marché Soupson. En plus, elles sont végétaliennes : les crèmes sont préparées à base de noix de cajous, c'est trop bon!  Pour ce qui est des sandwiches, la dinde-canneberges-fromage est phénoménale."}
{"text":"Awesome soup!! There is only 1 soup of the day but you can also buy yesterday's soup  cold in a mason jar. The soup today was an asparagus, spinach and pea soup. It was just wonderful! We sat in the dining area which was a long communal table.  The reason for -1 star is that we also purchased their millet salad and chili (which we heated later on for dinner) as well as some banana bread. We were disappointed in all of these items.   Loved: The soup, it was REALLY REALLY good! Also comes with bread :) Meh: The millet salad, the small salad, the banana bread, the chili. Basically, everything except for the soup."}
{"text":"Wow this is place is my favourite soup place! If you get to go multiple times, I strongly encourage you to talk to the owner. She is the sweetest girl in town. She makes her own soups, sandwiches, lasagna and salads. Everyday of the week is a different soup (you can go on their website and see the today's soup). And for the weekend, it's too giant drums of chilli!   Everything is amazing. The food is absolutely delightful, her soups are getting me addicted!!!   It's also a \"depaneur' so they have beer, smokes, sweet treats and kinda everything you need :)"}
{"text":"Open till 10pm every day of the week serving homemade and mostly vegetarian and even vegan soups, so already, I love Soupson. The creamy soups are made with an in house cashew milk which is beyond tasty and super filling. They also offer sandwiches with meats roasted in house so nitrate and preservative free.   This is also a regular dep so you can grab grab beers, smokes, organic vegetable chips: you know regular stuff. But you can also pick up organic fruits and veggies, and if you buy a big soup in a Mason Jar you can bring it back for refills, eliminating a little bit of the great wash of packaging in your life."}
{"text":"Simple, healthy and delicious :) nice if looking for a light lunch. I eat here every day"}
{"text":"I really liked this small cozy market.  Any place that offers mainly vegetarian cuisine, without compromising on taste is a winner in my book.  I'm afraid I wasn't blown away by the soup, which is the reason I've removed one star.  It was good, but just that.  I found it was lacking something, it's hard to put my finger on exactly what.  I'm not giving up though, I'll be back to try another soup, I don't think it's fair to judge everything based on a single experience, so look out for a review update  I definitely want to single out the warm and welcoming attitude of the staff.  They were very attentive and were happy to answer all the questions I had and more.  I also want to give bonus points because they have a nice long table set up with a bunch of chairs, so that when I visited yesterday in the biting cold wind, I was able to sit down, take a load off, and have a nice bowl of soup.  Before I forget, extra bonus points for being open until 10 PM every day!"}
{"text":"The soup changes on a day-to-day basis, which means some days it's brilliant (like beetroot & sweet potato, mmm) and other days it's not quite what you want.  There's a fridge full of heat-to-eat meals and salads and hummus, but I find them a little too expensive to buy for lunch!"}
{"text":"I don't know what they put in the soups and I don't want to know ...   I know one thing: ALL the soups are ridiculously good. It's a problem now because they are close to my job and the soups are very inexpensive. I hate how much I love it!   They also have a great selection of vegan salads, wraps, sandwichs AND SOUPS!  You should try it ... or maybe not ... I want all the soup."}
{"text":"Je m'y arrête pour apporter une soupe à la maison après avoir acheté mon café chez Union de l'autre côté de la rue. Toujours bon et frais mais limité comme sélection. Ca dépanne!"}
{"text":"A lovely spot to get fresh, healthy, quality eats and doubles as a dépanneur! The staff are super friendly, and you can tell that the team working there is a real family. Service is quick, and the food is delicious. Not a ton of options in the neighbourhood, but even if there were, I'd pick Soupson every time!"}
{"text":"This is my local dep, so of course I pretty much love it. The soups and the weekend chili to go are deelish and always act as my dinner when I cannot be bothered to cook, the cashew milk used as a base is really nice and filling. They've got other ready made wraps, yummy European cookies, baking supplies, beer, kale chips, places to sit and eat your soup and everyone that works here is super friendly.  Sometimes it is a little tough to find what you are looking for as the place is so eclectic and the lighting isn't so great though. Losing a star for their late opening hour and early closing hour and their only so-so selection of beer."}
{"text":"J'aime l'informalité de la place et ses prix economiques. Soupes tous les jours , jus frais gingembre et limonades pas cher. Grand Table disponibles à partager. Epicerie aussi."}
