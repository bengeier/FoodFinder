{"text":"The steak!!!   I went there at 4pm while on a business trip. It is hard to find quality and delicious halal meat when out of town.  The steak was huge, perfectly cooked (they asked for your preference) and delicious. It came with a big salad, lots of hummus and fries.  The restaurant in itself is quite boring, no decor. Nice staff, welcoming and flexible."}
{"text":"Très bons plats, portions généreuses, prix abordables. Excellente valeur pour le prix. Il peuvent améliorer le service."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and the food was superb! The price is also OK. I ordered the kebab and it was really good. It comes with a huge portion of rice and some hummus. The meat was so well-cooked I cannot describe. I was told the grilled chicken was also good. The place itself is pretty quiet and staff were friendly and willing to explain the dishes in cases you are not familiar with it. I def recommend this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant has unbeatable prices and excellent quality food. I would also like to add that the service is flawless and the food is always fresh. I love the fact that they are also opened most of the time. Great food plans for students too."}
{"text":"Their dishes are full of flavour, you can taste how carefully the meat was cooked. I had 1/2 grilled chicken which was tender and delicious. I loved their rice, the aroma is tempting and the taste is even better. We went during Ramadan time so we also got appetizers, lentil soup and desserts after. My only problem was that the servers were a bit inattentive and slow. We were four people and they gave two of us starters while the other two had to wait 15mins for theirs. It was hard to get their attention for more water, cutlery, etc. But will visit again for the taste for sure."}
{"text":"Just tried take out from this place. I would say it's more a 3.5/5. Was a little intimidated upon entering, since there was no one to greet me or give me a menu, and I just stood there for several minutes wondering if I should leave. It seems to be a place mostly frequented by the young men who go to mosque next door. I did get a few surprised glances, and I think I'm just not the usual demographic lol. The counter where the cash is located was also bare and the Faema espresso machine behind it looked almost as if it was never used, with the amount of plastic wrap and whatnot covering a good portion of it. After about five minutes of standing around, the phone rang and then finally, a gentleman came from the kitchen to answer it. He then briefly explained the menu and I settled on trying their baked lamb plate and a shish taouk for my significant other. The owner told me it would take 15-20 minutes since they make the shish taouk to order.  How was the food? The lamb shank was huge and came with an equally large portion of rice. Also included was a small salad and cup of hummus. The rice had an interesting smokey smell to it, and I noticed what looked like 3-4 cloves in it. It was tasty enough, but the smell is something I wasn't expecting and would have to get used to. The lamb, unfortunately, was completely cold, and I have the feeling that, since they were about to close, the owner gave me a cold piece  from the morning or whenever they made it and didn't bother to heat it at all. Had to nuke it twice when I got home for three minutes each and even after the second time, the lamb wasn't the right temperature. I gave up, since the microwave was drying it out. It wasn't bad by any means, but I probably wouldn't order it again. My husband said his shish taouk was good, and the patrons in the restaurant all seemed to be eating the grill plates, so I would probably stick to that. The hummus, however, was a winner, saltier and more garlicky than most hummus. The side salad was also good, well coated with a vinegary dressing. Overall, the owner is very nice, prices are super reasonable, and I think eating in vs. take out might be the way to go. I will definitely try again!"}
{"text":"Would definitely return here. Excellent customer service and very tasty/filling food. Recommend this to people who are in the area."}
{"text":"This place has by far the best prices and food in town. For just 5.99 you can get a huge delicious meal. They also have tasty on the grill choices like the taouk."}
{"text":"Best arabic food in town and they have specials plates everyday. And the waiters are so kind and helpful. Strongly recommended to give it a try. Plus the prices there are so cheap"}
{"text":"best food for only 11$ you get a big plate of shish taouk rice and fries + another plate of salad and hummus :D"}
{"text":"Our experience at Walima was really impressive. A huge meal for four people at the heart of downtown costs less than $30 bucks at this quality. That is rare.  The place is quiet and simple on decoration. Yet, the table clothes are unique and reminds me of the middle eastern style.   I advise you to try it and it will be a regular restaurant for us."}
