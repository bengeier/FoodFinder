{"text":"I like aburi (torched) style sushi so I was excited for Miku.   Came here at lunch on a weekday during the holidays and it wasn't very busy. We didn't make a reservation so we were seated near the chefs which is also away from the windows facing Queens Quay (could also be because we weren't dressed in suits?).   The aburi was well done, not too torched. The seafood platter was good for sharing between 2-3 people.   The staff was great but our food came out slowly."}
{"text":"One of the best fusion Japanese cuisine in TO!!! The space is a bit loud but great for friends gathering. The tasting menu is a great value. The portions are HUGE!"}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere are great. Decor is modern and minimalistic. Menu includes some different dishes not found in other more traditional Japanese restaurants. Plating is artsy and creative. It's the type of restaurant in which the servers present each small-sized dish followed with an extensive description and fancy hand gesturing. Flavour for most of our dishes for the most part were ok to good. The calamari appetizer 3/5, tuna tartare appetizer 3/5, salmon oshi sushi 4/5, various traditional maki rolls and nigiri sushi 4/5, various sashimi selections 5/5 - their fish is very fresh. Didn't have dessert. Prices are on the higher side  and in my opinion, not worth it. I've been to better high-end Japanese restaurants for what you pay like Yasu. Left the restaurant hungry; came home and ate a bagel. Overall, I would rate this restaurant 3.5/5. Good to visit at least once, but wouldn't go back with all the great Japanese restaurant options in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Miku and its sister restaurant Minami ever since they opened in Vancouver, so I was thrilled to hear it came to Toronto. Service is impeccable. Its location is not the best, but the space is bright, airy and very west coast in feel which is a plus. Miku is known as the OG flame-seared salmon aburi oshi sushi (a former sushi chef left and opened Ja Bistro), so it's worth trying. So, so good. Great sake collection as well. Want something sweet? Give the green tea opera cake a try."}
{"text":"Food: 4.5/5 Atmosphere: 4.5/5 Service: 4/5  Came here on a Monday night at around 6pm, didn't make reservations, but they were able to seat the three of us immediately.   Food:  MUST TRY MIKU ROLLl!! If you love uni as much as I do, definitely must try! The uni just tied all the ingredients together. Favourite roll of all time.  Saba and Salmon oshi sushi: Pressed sushi, both were very good. Flavour was awesome, but the dish was a little oily. But I assumed it was oil from the fish, so I had no problem with it. The slice of jalapeno pepper on the salmon sushi gave it a little kick, which was nice.  Green Tea Opera: Dessert wasn't too sweet, which I enjoyed. Came with a scoop of matcha ice cream, which also helped lessen the sweetness. Plating was beautiful. Jasmine Ice cream: I'm not sure if they changed the menu since December, because I couldn't find this flavour on the their menu anymore. But the other flavours they have now seem unique.  Sake sampler: came with three glasses of sake to try. I also can't find this on their menu anymore.  Atmosphere: Modern and sleek. High ceilings and well lit. We were seated right by the front, where the entrance and the bar were. I heard the inside is even prettier.   Service: Very good. The waiter who brought out our food was a little on the quiet and shy side. I can barely hear him when he was introducing our dishes.  Final thoughts: Would go again for the Miku roll alone and to check out the inner dining area of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The quality of fish was outstanding. Not a single disappointing bite! If you love sushi and sashimi, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"Would definitely recommend.   I went with a party of 10 and sat in the Mizumi private room. We all got the Shokai set menu ($75pp) along with some O Toro sashimi.   I'll try to keep this short...  - The Shokai set menu, 4 courses, was more than worth it. The portions are huge - see pictures. - For the Shokai meal, you get to choose your entree. For us it was either the sablefish (black cod), prime rib or pork belly. Sablefish and prime rib were spot on. - For those that don't eat raw fish, you can swap out the raw sushi for cooked fish which would be eel, cooked shrimp, etc.  - The sashimi was fresh and tasty and the pressed blow torched sushi was nice. Above all, the rice in the sushi was very good which made the sushi even better.   Additional details...  - There is parking in the RBC Waterpark Place and also across the street beside Harbour Sixty. - The Mizumi room has a minimum $750 spend. - The entrance to the restaurant is inside the building; you cannot get into the restaurant from the outside."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Miku and it lived up to my expectations. I ordered a variety of sushi, even combinations that I didn't think I would enjoy (but still wanted to try) and I was impressed with everything. The food is presented beautifully, there were a few things that I felt bad about eating and destroying the work of art.   I am eager to go back!"}
{"text":"Miku is one of the best Japanese restaurants in Toronto. While it is a high-end restaurant, I like how it's not pretentious and its crowd, diverse. You can spot people who are dressed anywhere from casual to classy, which livens up and relaxes the atmosphere. I've been here twice -- both times, I left delighted, wanting to come back. Here are my thoughts on the dishes I tried the last time I was there.  1) Crispy brussel sprouts: The brussel sprouts really are crispy! Served with bits of pork belly, they were yummy, but too salty for my taste. Would order something else for veggies the next time I'm there.  2) AAA Sterling Prime Rib: They recommend medium-rare for this dish. Extremely tender -- melts in your mouth! It is quite good. I would recommend, though, forgoing this one if there aren't a lot of people to share -- it might be better to save room for Miku's specialty, aburi sushi! Which brings me to my next point.  3) Salmon Oshi Sushi: This salmon aburi sushi is happiness. I fell in love the first time I tried it, and I was so happy to have it again. The soft, flavourful salmon creates a perfect harmony with the warm, supple rice on the bottom. Because the aburi sushi is eaten without soy sauce, you can fully appreciate the range of flavours and sensations of the sushi. A must-try.  4) Saba Oshi Sushi (Mackerel): Mackerel fans, rejoice. This mackerel aburi sushi is so delicious that I cannot decide whether I prefer this or the salmon. While mackerel has a strong flavour, this sushi is prepared so well that the distinct taste is not overbearing.   5) Soft Shell Crab Fritter Roll: Seemingly simple yet delicious. The soft shell crab tastes fresh, crispy, and juicy. If you're a fan of soft shell crab and rolls, I would highly recommend it.  I was too full to have any dessert this time, but Miku also has an excellent selection of desserts. I love their chocolate fondant -- simply divine."}
{"text":"I tried Miku in Vancouver and it was the best seafood I ever had n knowing that they have 1 opened in Toronto so I was dying to try. My friend n I tried in Nov 2015, we had the price fix of 5 and it was real full. The presentation of the appetizer was pretty cool, a ball shape of bowl with 3 seperate sections when u open it. However, the oysters weren't cold enough, the soup was too salty, the drinks were kinda water down and the aburis weren't as good comparing to Vancouver. However, service was excellent and atmosphere was nice but food wise I was disappointed."}
{"text":"very trendy place, but hot sake that's warm only and sushi with cold rice would only deserve 2 stars at this price point"}
{"text":"Incredible. The food, the drinks, the service! Salmon sashimi and the Albacore tuna and Wakame tartare were my favourite. Dessert we had the green tea opera, which was amazing.   The restaurant has a very sleek look to it and Is located inside the Rbc building  A little pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Soooooo good. My boyfriend didn't understand how you can pay so much for sushi until he tasted it - it's another level of delicious. Don't forget the Miso Salted Caramel ice cream for dessert!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty lunch. Had their Zen sampler for $29 each.  The food was different from any other Japanese restaurant I have been to. The ideas were refreshing and executed well. Didn't feel full after the food though. I had enough room for a another plate of sushi."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner and we all got their 7 course special. We called in advance about dietary requirements and they happily prepared two of the meals as vegan, and they nailed it.    The food was phenomenal, the staff was incredibly attentive and the restaurant is very clean and beautiful. Some of the best japanese food I've ever had.  It's a bit upscale, so you won't go for a casual lunch. I would save it for a special event.  Definitely 5 stars, would 100% go again."}
{"text":"Coming in with high expectations, Miku did not disappoint me.. however I felt that the quality could've been alittle better.   I came with two girls for a girls night out. The atmosphere is nice and I love the decor. We came without reservation and had to wait almost 30 mins for a table. Given that this is a new restaurant and for the good reviews, we decided to give it a shot and waited. While we waited at the sushi bar, my gfs ordered the aburi special drink which was fantastic. We definitely over ordered.. we ordered the miku platter and seafood platter.. I would really recommend this for sharing as it came with a lot of variety (sashimi was ok, clams and mussels were not my fave but the oysters were great), miku roll (excellent), calamari(my fave), beef carpaccio (didn't like it), prime rib(delicious), soft shell crab roll(loved it) and green tea opera(it was yummy and not too sweet). Our bill came up to a little over $300.. it's pricey but overall it was an alright experience.. I only give it 3 stars due to the service, our waitress hardly assisted us, we probably had to ask 2 different servers to assist us when we wanted to get the bill and have the food packed up."}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious on a Friday evening. LOVED the decor, service and presentation of food. Quiet atmosphere, good for date or small group of people. Pressed sushi is on par/better than Ja Bistro IMO. They do have two private sections where you can seat up to 12 people which is nice. Parking is underground accessible without leaving the building, about $10 for the 1.5 hour meal."}
{"text":"I was on the trip and craving for Japanese food. I read reviews and decided to give it a shot at this restaurant since it was only 5 minutes walk from my hotel. It is decollated implacably and the customer service was great. I saw the \"summer menu\" and had to try it! It was consisted with 4 courses (3 amuse bouche, surf & turf, Aburi Zushi and dessert). Grilled Foie Gras melted on my tongue. Surf and Turf was the most tender filet mignon I ever had and Lobster Tempra with summer squash. I was already close to full after finishing the 2 courses, but Aburi Zushi was so good that I had to have them all. The only thing that I didn't care for was  the dessert. Coconuts mousse and greentea ice cream was just average and although the presentation was very pretty, I wasn't impressed. My server and attentive and my food runner (he was more like food sommelier) explained each course of the meal when they are delivered. They have huge Sake menu and I loved the ambience of the restaurant, too. I will surely come back the next time I visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"Don't you just love when your server is knowledgeable about the menu? Morgan (who's very easy on the eyes), is just that, plus more. I often go to the Miku in Vancouver, so when this place opened up in Toronto, I just had to go! The ambiance, the food, the service... Amazing!! Will definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Perfect experience, service, and ambiance. My server was Janson and he delivered everything accordingly- perfectly timed. Was very friendly with my best friend and I and we had a perfect time.   CONSIDERING.... when we were first seated by the hostess at a table we did not like at all (segregated dining space), we requested for a booth in the larger dining room area. Host told us he would try his best to look into moving us over. Basically waited for a long time and he never got back to us. Janson had kindly offered water and to take any food requests for us- but I refused. I went to the hostess desk myself to ask the receptionist to see if a spot had been ready for us or looked into but she looked like she was not aware of this. So I mentioned that we didn't want to order until we moved since it meant the plates would need to be moved as well. We were told that the dining area was very busy and she would have to look into it... moments later we were then moved to a nicer desirable seat which was completely empty (the couple next to us was also moved moments later into the larger seating area)... I was NOT amused or happy with the receptionist/hostess.   Overall my dining experience was AMAZING thanks to Janson who gave recommendations and was very kind despite dealing with me with the issue of moving seats. I have already booked a dinner in a couple of weeks to celebrate my parents' anniversary.   Notes Food quality: over my expectations Ambiance: over my expectations Service: satisfied- servers explain what the dishes are and details If you make reservations... try to specify exactly where you would like to sit"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in the GTA!  I'd recommend getting the sushi of course but everything outside of that it just as delicious. I've been going back!"}
{"text":"Extraordinary meal beautifully selected by our waitress we enjoyed every course each uniquely combined flavors and textures hard to choose a single favorite"}
{"text":"- many servers, but not much services provided. long waiting when ask for something, besides your server, other servers not willing to help you much. - price is high, overpriced - the environment is too business feel - sushi was good - we order a raw seafood platter with lobster, it was so so and I went to washroom 20 mins after - went to another Japanese restaurant after, will never come back again"}
{"text":"Oysters are out of this world. The plum wine is amazing. The staff know their craft; they know the dishes inside and out and pay attention to the table in expert fashion: there when you need them and invisible the rest of the time. Pricey but not prohibitively so. Would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Miku is one of a few Toronto Japanese restaurants offering Aburi Oshi style sushi.  Caters to the downtown Financial district and Queen's Quay crowd.  Food - High quality all around.  Pretty good variety of sushi, sashimi and seafood menu items to allow for a diverse meal for two or a big group.  The presentation on every dish was well thought out and visually appealing.  Premium Aburi Sushi Platter - a nice variety of 12 pieces of Nigiri and Maki.  The Aburi style had a nice smokey flavour and texture to it.  My only beef with it was it tends to fall apart when dipping the pieces on their side in the soy sauce.  Sashimi Lunch - chef's choice of 10 pieces of Sashimi.  All of the pieces were fresh and well presented.  Yellowtail was especially tasty.  Coal Harbour Platter - very nice presentation and all of the seafood was fresh.  Prawns and Kale Goma-ae were the highlights.  Oysters and Mussels were just okay.  Service - Friendly and knowledgeable, although there were lapses in our server coming by between drinks and ordering and then follow up later on.  Environment - upscale feel to the restaurant with a combination of booths and tables.  The restaurant has a bright open feel to it.  Music is playing in background and noise level is moderate so probably better for a group vs a quiet evening for two."}
{"text":"We went on a Wednesday evening for the first time. We started with a sharp/grumpy host who seemed upset about the fact we did not make a reservation.   \"You are not a 3 Michelin star where you have to make a reservation 4 months in advance!\" Besides, walk-ins generate new clientele and if they would have done a good job, repeat customers.  Not a good start, but we didn't let that bother us. A very nice lady let us choose our seats, gave us the menu and left. We waited and we waited a bit more. No water, no service, no nothing. We were so shocked with the bad service that we decided to leave!  We didn't get to try anything!   You can have the best food in town, we are not interested if you can't treat your customers properly!"}
{"text":"Overall was great.  Only suggestion is their signature rectangular sushi pieces had a bit too much rice on them and could've done with a bit more fish! Sake flights were great as well. Overall my wife and thought it was a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Dined here once and I would say this was definitely a unique restaurant that provides a great choice for that special occasion, or even if you have a larger group they'll have a spot for that as well.   Firstly it's a bit hidden off the street so don't expect to see it right away, I know I had to look around for a bit. As you enter the restaurant you'll see what most sushi restaurants have and that  is the \"open concept kitchen\" with tables upfront to watch them prepare the food, so I guess for the guest that want to just pop in for a quick lunch that's perfect, or if you just want to watch the chef's in action. If you're there for a special occasion they'll walk you right through that area and into a more of a restaurant type setting.  They have private room to accommodate the larger group and many booth style dining areas. The staff are very knowledgeable when it comes to the dishes as they have some fix-course menus which I would highly recommend if you go there, it gives you a taste of the menu and they'll explain it to you as you go along dish-by-dish The tasting menus come prepared in a unique way and at first you'll be like what is that and it will be your dish shown in a unique way.   I rather let the chef just put something together for me and surprise me, otherwise I would be still be there looking at the menu deciding as they have many assortments to select from and all seem delicious. So once again do yourself a favour and just go for one of the tasting menus, you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Pricy for sure but worth it. Amazing date night. Definitely one of those quality over quantity sushi places. See pics! They're sooo good. Two people can be full on ~3 dishes + dessert & drinks. Not bloated but comfortably full.   Must Try's: anything abrui!  Things to note: dessert is very small (see matcha image)"}
{"text":"AMAZING. Aburi style sushi is all I ever want to eat. This place is great. Such fresh sushi, great ambiance and great service."}
{"text":"Amazing service and decor and atmosphere. But their sushi can be very heavy. I waa so sure I would be a fan of their aburi style sushi, but I found it very heavy. It was too creamy and rich for my taste. However, the ingredients were so fresh and the food was obviously done well, it just wasn't for me. I enjoyed their cocktails and appetizers more than the main stars of the show-the rolls and the sushi. Their prices are obviously higher, but I thought it was all very reasonable given location, decor and quality of food and service. They don't give you that fake crab shit in their rolls- REAL crab meat at Miku. Overall a great place for a high-end date or to treat someone on a special day or a douchy business lunch. If you like your sushi with umph, give this place a visit."}
{"text":"Mediocre overpriced sushi. Cold rice and inattentive service.   We came here at 9pm on a Thursday night. Ordered 4 different dishes including the Saba roll, soft shell crab roll, octopus appetizer and the warm roll.   Overall, the rice was cold and stale. The fish was super fresh, but expected at a restaurant like this.   Overall, the quality was nowhere near the original Miku in Vancouver. If you're looking for the same as Vancouver, go to JaBistro, and you'll experience a much better overall experience.   Update 1: sitting in the restaurant for 15 minutes. Can't find server. Really annoyed, can't check out and leave.   Update 2: our waitress just came back. She smells like smoke and clearly went for a smoke instead of serving our bill, which is why she's late.   Seriously folks, please try the service at JaBistro. You'll understand what I mean immediately."}
{"text":"Great quality of sushi. Love the aburi sushi - 3 types (flame-seared salmon, prawn, and mackerel). Got a few nigiri a la carte and they were amazing too.  The sashimi platters were $25 per person which I thought was pretty pricey for the amount of pieces you get but quality was amazing. I went in a large group and had the Miku Waterfront Platter to start- the sashimi and shellfish were great but Didn't love the salmon ceviche or poke.  I thought the service was great. There was a small soya sauce spill mishap but the server was super apologetic and cleaned it right away.   Entree wise we tried the bouillabaisse and the prime rib. I didn't love the bouillabaisse but it might be because I expected more of a hearty broth. Miku's broth was much more like a consomee. The prime rib was on the other hand much better than I expected. The meat was very tender and melted your mouth.  In terms of the sake list, i thought it could have more of a variety over a range of prices. I don't think they was a Junmai available under $100 (720ml) but the one I did get was outstanding."}
{"text":"3.5*  Came here for lunch with a friend recently and we both thoroughly enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Service was excellent but the food was mediocre. Full disclosure, I'm not a big fan of pressed and torched sushi (rice is too soft and the smoke just overwhelms everything), but I'll eat it :)"}
{"text":"Tried Miku about a month after it opened in Toronto - expecting it to be like the Vancouver Miku.  However, it was disappointing.  The Aburi beef carpaccio and green tea opera were nothing like the Vancouver one (Vancouver's was so much better) - the rest of the sushi and rolls were closer to Vancouver's but still not as good.  For those who have never had the chance to try it in Vancouver, this is an ok / good place, compared to others in Toronto.  Once you try the Vancouver one, you'll understand the difference and why the Vancouver one is the best"}
{"text":"Nothing special, slightly overpriced.   I had the Red Wave Roll and the Sushi Oshi.  Both tasted average. They didn't have a significant impact on my taste buds. Average quality, mediocre impression.  The presentation of the food is very elaborate, all the chef's effort seems to have gone into making the dishes look good, with less care for the texture and taste.  The high price and small quantity of food leave a lot to be desired. Honestly, the food isn't horrible, but the price is far too high for the quality and quantity paid for.   Miku Sushi. You pay for the beautiful interior of the restaurant, but don't expect an unforgettable meal that will entice you to return."}
{"text":"The service, food, atmosphere and decor blew my mind. If you are an \"AYCE\" cheap sushi kind of person...don't come here. This food is not meant to be stuffed into your mouth to get your money's worth. This food is meant to be appreciated bite by bite. I've been back here several times and tried almost every thing on the menu. If you aren't sure what to order..the servers provide recommendations suited for the first timer to regular patrons! Try their drinks too...they are delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Prices justify food quality. Service can be off at times, but i go for the food!"}
{"text":"Went here with my friends on a weekend! The place is super pretty and the servers are all very nice, but oh my goodness the food... the food was so good! This was my second time going to Miku (the first being in Vancouver) but the quality of all the food was the same! I highly recommend coming here! Although it can be a but more pricey, the food is well worth the money spent"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi and Japanese restos in the city! Great upscale vibe (good for client dinners, and celebrations). You will be very impressed with the food, ambiance and service."}
{"text":"Best soft shell crab roll I have ever eaten. Must get item along with the salmon oshi!"}
{"text":"The ambiance of the restaurant is nice. The food is the main attraction here. Tried the Salmon Oshi sushi and it was delicious! Sashimi was fresh as well. Apparently this restaurant is famous for their Aburi style sushi. The flame seared technique and the sauce used definitely made the sushi taste amazing. Will definitely go back. Next time want to try the Miku waterfront platter."}
{"text":"The service was impeccable, and the restaurant is beautiful, however the sushi wasn't what I expected and the quality was questionable. Even their most basic rolls like the tuna roll weren't well made. The sushi rice was cold, whereas it should be warm or room temperature. The fish was just not good and tasted old even though the restaurant was like 4 days old. I don't know what to say. I really expected a lot more from this restaurant.   I understand that they're not a \"traditional\" sushi place, but if you set out to improve something, please master the traditional technique first.  The other dishes were either bland or had really bad flavour combinations. I'm shocked that even with 10 ingredients in them, the dishes were as bland as they were.  Their liquor list is impressive however. They are the only place in Canada where I've seen Diplomatico rum on the menu. Good call!"}
{"text":"I just had an amazing meal with my husband at Miku. We just came back from Japan not too long ago, so we had fairly high expectations. Miku did not disappoint us. We shared an aburi sashimi sampler, salmon oshi  sushi, and aburi prime. Everything tastes so delicious and fresh. To end our meal, we shared a green tea opera. It was one of the best dessert I ever had. Just like the waiter described, it was like a Christmas in my mouth."}
{"text":"Seems that management puts all the newbie/poor servers on Sunday lunch rounds. Main server did very little else other than taking our initial orders. Did not come check on us, refill water etc. Assistant that came to remove plates made no eye contact, chatter, etc. even when thanked her for removing dishes. Ordered a second round of shrimp ozisushi and it took such a long time that we cancelled it, paid the bill, and left. They were lucky to receive an even 10% tip.  Hostesses at the front on the other hand were very pleasant both before and after our lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place. We didn't make the reservation, but got bar seats luckily. Definitely a really nice place to go for Japanese fusion."}
{"text":"I was very excited to eat here as I heard a lot of good things about this restaurant.   The presentations were beautiful for all the dishes we ordered - sitting at the sushi bar, I witnessed the staff members paying extra attention to the presentations of all the orders coming out of the kitchen.  Taste wise, almost everything we ordered definitely lived up to its high expectation. All the ingredients were fresh and well handled. Aburi Sushi and Oshi Sushi were my personal favorites; I would come back for more Aburi Sushi in the future for sure. Aburi Sushi was so delicately prepared, and it was a pure joy to taste them.  However, I personally find their rolls a little over seasoned. Ingredients used in the rolls were fresh and flavorful enough, I don't think they need that much of seasoning to taste good.  Overall, it was a great experience to dine at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm not a sushi or seafood fan. But the atmosphere and decor at Miku are great! I loved the ambiance and the service was impecable!"}
{"text":"Was there the other day and it was okay.  A little over price for what I what you get.  I have been to their Vancouver location and I must say it's night and day when it comes to the food quality and service."}
{"text":"I've never been to Miku in Vancouver but wanted go to the Toronto location since there was a lot of hype around the opening. The service and atmosphere are phenomenal, the servers are very friendly and attentive, and will explain the details of every dish. The only downside is the location of the restaurant which is on the first floor of the RBC Waterpark Place. The view from the windows is underwhelming, as it's right at street level.   Food: We started with the Albacore Tuna Tartare and Aburi Sashimi Selection. The four types of sashimi (2 pieces each) were perfect for sharing and trying an assortment of fish. We got the Salmon and Ebi Oshi sushi and Miku roll to share. Being my first time trying oshi sushi, I didn't have anything to compare to but I loved the \"melt in your mouth\" type of texture. The Miku roll was delicious as well, but I don't think it's anything special for the price.   Dessert and Drinks: We ordered the Green Tea Opera which seems to be Miku's signature dessert. The matcha ice cream was very rich and one of the best I've tried, the actual dessert itself however was just OK in my opinion. We also ordered a cocktail and beer, the cocktail was very tasty and presented beautifully but it was 2/3 ice.   I would definitely come back again to try their other rolls but at the price point it's more of a special occasion place. Also, I think it's alright to skip the dessert and drinks and order more of their delicious sushi instead!"}
{"text":"Four of us came here last weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday.   One friend used to work in the RBC buliding and commented on what a nice job they've done with the revamp of the lobby as well as the restaurant.  The decor of the restaurant was nice, but the high ceilings certainly contributed to sound being carried, and the place was a bit noisy.  Since there were four of us, we went all out to try as many things as possible. -  Spicy edamame - nice to have it a little different -  Smoked soy grilled octopus - excellent, would order again -  Aburi beef carpaccio - nothing special -  pan seared scallops - order came w 3, and needed to add an extra scallop for a charge.  Delicious! -  salmon aburi + Aburi prime - perhaps my expectations were too high, but this was just OK -  red wave roll - OK;  didn't blow us away -  2 orders of salmon oshi sushi (after one taste of a piece, we immediately placed an extra order!) - 10oz prime rib served with sauteed mushrooms and mashed potatoes - it's a perfect and generous sized dish for non-sushi eaters - crispy brussel sprouts (yum!) - pickled veggies - Green Tea opera cake + chocolate fondant cake -  two bottles of wine  Service was professional but almost too efficient.  Every time someone walked by our table, they were extremely prompt to whisk away any empty dishes.  This happened so frequently to the point that we sarcastically joked that the restaurant must have run out of dishes.  (It was a busy Saturday night!)  Overall, everything was delicious, but it really was the salmon oshi sushi that was an immediate hit!  And believe it or not, the prime rib was really good also.  We all  enjoyed our meal, and this experience will help guide what we order on our next visit (yes, there will be a next time for sure!)  For context, I would rate Miku with the likes of Blowfish (now Katana?), JaBistro, and KasaMoto (although my friend had just dined at KasaMoto and felt that Miku was better)."}
{"text":"Unbelievable - my wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary with the miku kaiseki. Let me tell you that the price I paid for was well worth it. We came out thoroughly impressed as we get to sample the wide range of offering from miku.  Standouts include the prime rib and the sushi. Will definitely come back and order other selections from their menu."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food! This would be our fourth time going to Miku and service was very good in general. Food was amazing (albeit pricey). We were celebrating Father's Day and brought our three year old with us. They had no problems accommodating a high chair and giving him some crayons to play with. My husband had the shokai Kaiseki set. There was a seafood app, which was an amazing selection of different seafood such as oyster shooter, fresh scallop, fresh oyster, shrimp cocktail. He chose the Prime Rib for his main which was large! Mash potatoes on this plate was divine! I had the Miso Sablefish and my plate was clean once my son and I were done! He loved the fried cauliflowers on the plate. We had an aburi sushi plate and the set had an additional sushi platter as well. Dessert was a mini green tea opera which was a great end to the meal."}
{"text":"Great place, food & staff! Nami was very sweet & did a great job! Hope to see her again soon."}
{"text":"Sushi isn't normally my thing, but my friend who is a chef recommended this place and my S.O loves sushi! So I thought I'd surprise him with reservations. Best decision. We got reservations immediately, when we arrived the greeters were so friendly and showed us to our seats right away. My chef friend had told me about the salmon aburi -lightly flame grilled salmon- so we had to order that! Our server was incredibly knowledgeable, listing off ingredients and origins of the ingredients. She offered her advice on pairings and menu items. As I was sceptical about the sushi I ordered the prime rib- pictures below. It was really well prepared. When the aburi came out I couldn't resist and told my S.O I wanted to try a piece. Fast forward 5 minutes and I had nearly eaten all of his plate. He ordered me dessert to distract me from his sushi plate. I had the green tea cake. It was amazing. But since that visit I've been back and have to suggest the chocolate ganache dessert!   The scene: great date night! Drinks on the patio with friends, lunch with family."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, been twice and both times were phenomenal."}
{"text":"The atmosphere there was pretty good. However, I'm pretty disappointed with the service. I emphasized I didn't want any onions before I ordered the food. The waitress seemed to forget about that. The taste of the food was disappointing, too. The fish was not fresh enough. The quality just didn't match the price."}
{"text":"Miku is one of those places where it's correct to boast it's cultural dishes. The dishes were a bit pricier than the usual a la carte sushi but it was definitely worth it. You wouldn't be wasting a penny on the food or service.  We had the sashimi lunch platter which had red tuna, salmon, yellow snapper, and scallop. It was fresh and tasted perfectly seasoned even without the soy sauce and wasabi. Which is what I feel sashimi should actually taste like.  The Miku four dish spring set was made with seasonal food and had a variety of seared fish (tuna, red snapper), salad, and ingredients native to Japanese dishes. The dessert was amazing, perfectly balanced in sweetness and tartness.   Would definitely come back when the sushi craving strikes!"}
{"text":"One of the best Sushi places in Toronto. Great service from the time you enter the door until you leave. Food to die for!   BC location is amazing as well."}
{"text":"I should preface that this is based off of a winterlicious meal.   Pro:  - The minimalistic tables and nice ambience of the restaurant make it a pleasant dining experience - the service is great and the wait staff knowledgeable about the food. - Their signature jalapeno salmon sushi consisting of torched salmon skin separated by a layer of rice is unique due to the interesting texture. - Their beef tenderloin skewers are also cooked to a perfect medium rare and served with a delicious mixed green garnish. - the chocolate croissant bread pudding was the best I've every had.  Con: - I can't believe this but I've had better sushi at an AYCE restaurant. This is not to say the the meal didn't have spectacular highlights (see above). However, when the sushi was bad it really made you feel ripped off. The aburi (flamed salmon) was paired with an all too sour glaze and the yellow tail tuna ( was dry and bitter.  Conclusion: I imagine if you go to Miku often and knew which dishes were the best of the best this review may have turned out differently. Unfortunately, going off the ratio of good to bad dishes in their winterlicious menu I would say that 1/3 of the dishes are well done and appropriate for the price, 1/3 are acceptable but only on par with a good AYCE sushi place and finally the last 1/3 which is a mess of poor quality ingredients and disappointing pairings of flavour. It is this last third of dishes that make Miku a hit and miss wheel of chance. For a $$$ priced resturant this is too much inconsistency."}
{"text":"I was finally able to make plans to go to Miku this past Saturday with my best friend of 28 years.  I was so excited that it had opened in Toronto as I had been to the Vancouver location several times and absolutely loved it, in fact I make it a point to go whenever I visit.  I was even more excited to bring my friend, who hadn't been before but I knew would be blown away.  I would like to recount my recent experience at the Toronto location, please keep in mind that we arrived just past 3pm, not a soul in the place from what we could see from the main entrance.  The hostess was on the phone and motioned to us that she would be a minute.  We were slightly worried that they might not be open or taking tables but after after 5 minutes of standing at the entrance waiting to speak to the hostess she got off the phone and said \"for two?\" and proceeded to walk us around the corner to the larger part of the restaurant, which is absolutely stunning but at no point offered an apology for making us wait.   Seated at the table.  Beautiful spot, there were maybe 3 other tables plus a larger party who left shortly after we arrived.  The menu offering was limited but not unexpected for a restaurant of this caliber between peak hours.   We had absolutely no problem selecting a handful of items to try from the menu, we were absolutely famished.    Our server was friendly but very inattentive. The food was honestly very mediocre from what I was accustomed to.    Much of it tasted like it was prepared prior to ordering and reheated or re-plated. Even the Salmon Aburi Oshi wasn't the same quality that I remember but was still good enough to eat, just felt like it wasn't freshly prepared to order.   Then came for the post meal clearing, or lack thereof. We literally sat with dirty dishes in front of us for 15 minutes,  so long that fruit flies started congregating at the table, which was very unappetizing.  I started moving the dishes to the empty tables beside us. Our server/bartender even walked by us, looked at the table as she walked by and continued on her to way another table and failed to return to ours at all.  We finally had to flag down a food runner to ask for our bill. Our server then returned to our table cleared a couple dishes and asked if we wanted the bill.  Not sure that she knew it was being handled or not but another server came over with the bill and debit machine.  She asked how everything was and I told her that it was good up until the point when our plates weren't cleared and the fruit flies started.  She kind of shrugged it off with a half arsed apology.     Again, I understand we were visiting during off peak hours but service and food quality should not change.  Unfortunately I am a firm believe the tip reflecting the level of service and typically never tip less than 15% but this was outrageously horrible.   I would like to think that ensuring I dine here at lunch or dinner would provide a better experience.  The customer service needs to be amplified 100%, especially because there isn't a drop dead gorgeous view like the Vancouver restaurant boasts."}
{"text":"We visit their Vancouver restaurant whenever we are in YVR, always great experience!  While food is at the same great standard, the service at this location definitely stands out so much more, which made the whole experience more enjoyable.   The food feels \"cleaner\" and more refine compare to Ja Bistro. Overall we might still go back to Ja Bistro just because they offer specials such as waygu beef"}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this restaurant at first as a lot of people had told me that Jabistro was better, but I decided to give Miku a try and really enjoyed it!  - hotate aburi sashimi I love scallop sashimi so perhaps I set my expectations a little too high. This just didn't melt in my mouth as much as I thought it would, but it was still enjoyable  - beef carpaccio  My first ever beef carpaccio so I don't really have a point of comparison, but coming from a person who used to think raw beef was gross, I still really enjoyed it and would order it again!  - aburi oshi sushi This dish comes with 2 each of the salmon, ebi and Saba aburi sushi, which is nice since you get to try all 3. Personally I didn't like the salmon aburi as much as I thought it had less flavour and didn't have the smokiness of the other two. My favourite was the ebi, which had this melt-in-your-mouth creaminess.  - green tea opera Very nicely plated dessert with a decent amount of matcha flavour and not too heavy. Nice end to the meal.  Everything is plated nicely and the flavours mesh together very well. This place is quite expensive though, but I'd recommend it for a special occasion.  You can reserve seats in the dining room but the patio and bar are first come first served."}
{"text":"I am quite the regular at Jabistro, I might compare the two locations but I am definitely  going to try not to. I also do not enjoy writing reviews and I am new to Yelp (I read reviews but I just became a member) so hopefully my review will be helpful.  My experience was quite divine, I went in for lunch today with my coworkers and a client. This was actually my second visit and I enjoyed my experience so much that I decided to comment.   After reading reviews I was quite nervous about getting a table, especially for a group of six with no reservation...I know, huge risk! The hostess was quite the doll. Her energy as she heard we were a larger group was quite comforting. She has the winner personality, meaning not only confident but also very sweet. There was something about her that made me feel like if I had any problems, that she would make sure it was solved. I can't remember her name, she pronouced it 4 times but none of us could manage. I thought it was French but she said it was Kurdish. My group, being the talkative adults that we are, introduced ourselves after she pronounced her whole legal name to make it even more complicated(it started with a D) and she recognized a Dutch last name, she speaks FIVE languages..(impressive!) She seemed quite modest about it and of course my Dutch client tested her Dutch and German skills. After she walked away he admitted that her Dutch and German skills are definitely authentic and fluent, she wasn't joking/lying about speaking all of those languages daily!  the server? SHE WAS AMAZING. Probably the best server I have ever had. Her spirit was so powerful, wow what a presence. She knew everything and made the experience delightful. She also dealt with our indecisive group like a professional. She seemed quite genuine and not your regular: hi im being extra nice for nice tips. She fell into the \"I want to make sure you enjoy your experience\" category. I didnt learn much about her as I was closer  to the window and I was also starving, I couldn't stop eating, I do wish I had the chance to let her know that she was the cherry on top for us. It was my second time and everybody elses first time..but I am more than sure we will be regulars from now on!   I'd like to add that the restaurant is gorgeous..and BIG  I definitely suggest the Miku Zen for lunch. Its like an elegant version of a bento box but 20 x better than any bento box. The food is just amazing, melts in your mouth. I really would emphasize more on the food but I will comment again when I go in for dinner next week and I will compare in depth  what I prefer from both menus.  My reference to Jabistro earlier was made because  the hostess and my server really made our experience stand out...making Miku the winner for me!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal, with inventive sushi dishes, nice cocktails, and wonderful service.  Ate here as a group of 4, and everyone raved about the dinner for the rest of the evening.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came a couple months ago with 4 other people. Our server was very attentive and really took the time to explain to us what we were eating. He even told us when our orders overlapped and made other suggestions. Because of our numbers, we got to try a variety of dishes. The food was amazing. It just melts in your mouth. I am looking for another reason to go back because it is quite expensive."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. The sushi is great, and has quite large variety that you can try. I love the aburi oshi sushi menu, but I couldn't tell the difference in sashimi.. Since they are just raw fish  For dessert, I would definitely recommend the caramelized apple tart, so gooood!!   Overall, it is pretty much the same type of sushi restaurant comparing to Jabistro, I can't tell the difference. Both have nice atmosphere and yummy food, and of course, expensive.. but worth trying! (personally I prefer Jabistro tho)"}
{"text":"I was truly impressed by the care in preparation of and the quality of the food here. I am not a seafood person, but the salmon and mackerel dishes I tried were gorgeous - in presentation, taste and texture. Service was prompt and courteous and our server cleaned our table several times, so even if we dropped a piece of our flawless meal on it (which I did)! We were confident to pick it back up and eat it. The server also explained the minutiae of the elements in each dish that was served, which I appreciated as well. The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that we found it significantly more expensive than other similar places we've tried with food of equal quality, so even with a fairly small amount of food ordered the bill was quite a bit larger than I anticipated. But otherwise it was a fantastic meal that we thoroughly enjoyed."}
{"text":"Tasting menu sparkles some light.  The sashimi boat has the very fresh sashimi on the ice with toro,  hamachi, 2 oysters, shrimps,..  The head of the shrimps are taken to be deep fried.  The next is a sphere separated into 3 dishes with seared scallop, sashimi and sashimi tartar.  Then surprisingly comes a steak that is so tender and juicy.  Last comes with 5 pieces of sushi including scallop.  The dessert consists of a green tea ice cream, a signature 7 layers cake - marvellous and a bean curd fruit paste.  Overall service is excellent, food is above average, sashimi is super fresh and the atmosphere is modern"}
{"text":"This must be one of the best restaurants I've been in Canada. The service is good, atmosphere is good. Recommended for a date."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal. Best octopus appetizer I've had at any restaurant in the city. Incredibly tender and seasoned to perfection. Highly recommend the square pressed rolls because of the softness of rice, grilled Salmon and lemon zest garnish. Miku's plate presentation is a textbook example of how all restaurants should plate their dishes!"}
{"text":"Went here during the grand opening and the ambiance is very nice. Service was really slow and I'll get to that later...  Food highlights: Miku Roll- amazing! I would come back just for this roll. The creaminess of the uni on top really made it a melt in your mouth roll with a fusion of different flavours Saba Oshi Sushi- one of the best Aburi or flame seared sushi i've had. The saba was cut perfectly and very flavourful.  Pass: Coal Harbour Platter- we ordered the reg size for $32 and it was definitely not worth it. The fresh oysters were sandy and the 3 dipping sauces that came with the platter overpowered the seafood too much.   Overall, i would probably only come back here for the miku roll and drinks. Items were pricy and there wasn't really anything that wowed me. Also, the service was deplorable! We had to flag our waitress every single time we needed anything ( including taking our initial order). It was really frustrating to see her helping other customers in our section one-by-one ( e.g bringing a bill to a customer and then immediately going to back) without making eye contact with any of the other customers to see if anyone else wanted anything.  Multi-tasking=efficiency!! Hopefully the service will improve over time."}
{"text":"Great food. Exceptional service. A bit pricey, but worth it.   It was my second time eating here today. This time, I brought my baby during a weekday at lunchtime, so it was pretty busy with all the finance folks. I was worried that this restaurant wouldn't be baby-friendly given its usual clientele are people on Bay St. Fortunately, service was fantastic. They had high chairs and got me a table with more space for my baby gear.  Food was fresh and tasty. I had the Zen combo which is delicious.  I will be coming back again."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Miku fan... and a fan of Miku's sister restaurant, Minami in Vancouver (both are the daughters of Seigo Nakamura, the founder). And, when I first saw the Miku sign appear a few months ago along Waterfront, I became excited. It was like having an old friend from the West Coast come to visit me in Toronto.  The restaurant has been open a month and some of the West Coast favs are on the menu: the Red Wave Roll, Salmon Oishi Sushi, the Aburi Sushi Sampler... but there are some East Coast specific items: poached lobster, soft shelled crabs, bouillabaisse, and the Smoked Soy Grilled Octopus. It's a West Coast sushi experience with East Coast fish.   The one thing that is on both menus is their fantastic Kaffir Lime Panna Cotta, which I will could all day, every day. Also, my favourite roll is the Red Wave, which pairs well with a tangy wine like the Hansen Cabernet.  I'm sorry to say that *unfortunately* I notched all other sushi restaurant reviews down one star because Miku raised the bar for sushi in Toronto for me. The atmosphere is upscale and trendy but they won't turn you away if you're wearing casual clothes (like sushi restaurants do in San Francisco). The service is completely fantastic."}
{"text":"The ambiance is really nice here, and perfect for a nice dinner but I wished that food was on par with the Miku in Vancouver. I was quite disappointed, I enjoyed the sashimi platter- very fresh but the pressed rolls and sushi rolls did not stay intact. I much rather prefer jabistro!"}
{"text":"Went there for Winterlicious lunch. The food is fresh and of good quality, highly recommended. 4 stars for their services, our waitress is very friendly. Also went there last year on valentine day, last year's valentine menu is ok but over priced in terms of the portion."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is the best sushi place in Toronto. It is a bit pricey, however the ingredients used were very fresh!"}
{"text":"I came to this place with colleagues for a team lunch and having heard good things about this place, I thought it was going to be really good.  Maybe I've had too much sushi, I didn't find it special.  I know it's very unfair to compare this place to an AYCE restaurant but the gap between AYCE places and authentic sushi places have never been closer.  I'm sure the quality of the fish is better here but can you really tell the difference?  Sushi platter i ordered for lunch is good but torched sushis at AYCE places are just as good.  The one thing that disappointed me a little was the colour of the fish on the sushi looked a little dark as if they were left uncovered for a while.  The photos didn't turn out as good, my wife was like they don't look very fresh when I posted them on social media.  Anyways that's not point, you come here for a better dinning experience, it's a higher end place.  This is a place for dates or business.  I don't think someone will come this place for the first time and say it's the best sushi they've ever tasted.  You get it."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food, 2 stars for the service.  On the food, consistently good quality, sushi is very fresh and flavorful in particular the unagi and hamachi were divine.  The fatty tuna was ok, but ive definitely had better.  Really enjoyed their blowtorched sushi, tasty and very different.  On the service, they were definitely trying to rush us out the door.  Literally 2 minutes after our appetizers arrived here are the main courses being jammed on the table.  Our server was very friendly and attentive but a bit too much so constantly asking us 'do you want anything else, desert perhaps?\"  How about letting me finish my dinner first.  Given the prices they charge and i was there for dinner and not a quick lunch, i dont appreciate being hurried out the door because they are anxious to fill another table."}
{"text":"Decided to try out Miku this week and instantly fell in love.  Heard a lot of good of things on this on IG and through west coast friends and I will add to the fire.  Great ambience, decor is beautiful, and it had a good vibe.  Wife and I split the tuna tartare which was delicious and well-presented, the Miku roll which was delicious and melted in my mouth, but in my opinion was a bit greasy after the blowtorching of the mayo. Also had the Miku Signature Selection with nigiri, aburi and other pieces, which was fun and tasty.  Ended off with the matcha chocolate molten cake which what's the highlight for my wife.  This was not an inexpensive meal.  Will be back to travel through the menu!"}
{"text":"High end sushi is the best description I can give it.   It was very tasty.  It's the first time I ate sushi with any sauces and it was delicious.   The sushi was fused with sauces and flavors so there was no need to add anything.  The sucki was very good to.  We had three different kinds.  One was a chocolate flavored the next was a fruity and the last one had a dry taste start but finished with a wonderful flavor.  The presentation of the food was beautiful.  My plate was so pretty I didn't want to eat it.  The decor was modern chic with a white  and gray colors.  Our waiter was very informative and attentive.  This restuarant was on the pricey side but it worth experiencing it at least once."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Never fails to be a great place for special occasions."}
{"text":"Their aburi sushi is the best. I also cannot get enough of their Brussels sprouts. Great service and good quality food. The price can be a bit high."}
{"text":"Miku is one of my splurge restos but I keep returning because it's absolutely delicious. It has a big spacious dining room and a beautiful patio. The menus had a mix of fusion dishes as well as more traditional sushi ones. I personally have tried both their set menus and a-la-carte ordering and prefer Miku to Jabistro as the fish tastes fresher and more carefully cut and the seasoning on the dishes are better."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in here for a lunch when we were in town for a wedding. It was amazing!! Outstanding & friendly service, great ambiance, and delicious food. Also has vegetarian options which is a plus for me! I loved the vegetarian lunch platter---so creative and beautiful."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! So good for the price. Not pricey but great quality. The atmosphere is very sophisticated and the servers are super well mannered and kind. Recommend it 100%!"}
{"text":"The sushi are amazing here. I came here with a group of friends for her birthday and the service was amazing. If you want their signature green tea cake, you have to reserve it in advance. This is a fancy restaurant so of course, the price is quite high and you would not be full with one dish. Overall, this is a great place for pressed sushi."}
{"text":"Came for the 5 course set menu. I was pretty impressed... there was clear attention to detail at every step of the way, and the service was great. The 5 course menu started with sashimi, which of course was fresh, but also served several different varieties and cuts of sashimi slightly different than the usual fare. Paired with 2 types of soy sauce, which was great for contrast.  The cooked items were excellent as well. There was a bouillabaisse (which actually wasn't very Japanese!), but I liked the nod to other seafood cultures. This happened again with a pair of raw oysters (not cooked food, I digress) one from PEI and one from BC - again, a nod to the Canadian element, which I appreciated.  The maki were inventive as well, with several textures and tastes within one roll.   The dessert was fantastic, particularly the Green Tea Opera. Wow... it was partly creamy, partly crunchy - like an Asian millefeuille, and absolutely spectacular. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for my husband's birthday. We got the Miku tasting menu, came with 5 courses. Everything is amazing! Sashimi is so fresh, prime ribs is a Japanese style which is best one I ever had. The desert is amazing too, they also put candle on the dish for birthday! It was very good experience, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Visited Miku today for a celebration dinner and had the tasting menu for 2. I don't really know where to start considering how mixed my feelings are on my experience. After having omakase experiences at restaurants like Morimoto, the 5 course tasting menu was pretty underwhelming to say the least. Cocktails were also pretty meh.   The 1st course was literally only 5 pieces of sashimi. Points for the wonderful freshness, especially for the toro and hamachi. The only thing is that the 5 pieces of sashimi was plated on a huge bowl of ice, which cheapens the dish and makes it lack-lustre. Server asked us if we wanted to take the heads from the ama-ebi shrimp and fry it for consumption, which of course we opted for. When it came out, it was literally the shrimp heads lightly dusted with flour, and deep fried. Kind of awkward and hard to eat, very much unlike soft shell crab.   2nd course had the fanciest and playful plating - the server presented a sphere, which was disassembled to show 3 different plates. The plates were seared scallop with a miso/bacon sauce, tuna(?) tartare with wonton crisps, a piece of cooked shrimp with cocktail sauce, and two oysters. The scallop was fantastic - cooked to perfection. The miso sauce underneath it was a bit salty, but that was to be expected since its miso and bacon together. The most underwhelming part of this course was the cooked shrimp. I would much rather see something else there than a lousy simple piece of cooked shrimp. It wasn't even ebi sashimi style - it was more like a plain cooked shrimp from a platter you can buy @ Costco. Also, the oysters were pretty dull and the temp was too warm for what it was.   3rd course: Prime rib with \"wasabi\" infused gravy and an assortment of mushrooms.  This was the most confusing part of the entire kaiseki experience. Prime rib? With no fancy Japanese fusion twist? Am I missing something here? Am I suddenly at a Keg restaurant? It was oddly misplaced to say the least. Continuity was just off, and it was laughable. The gravy tasted like it was from a sketchy diner or, dare I say it, from a Clubhouse packet. No wasabi or horseradish flavours were even remotely present... sigh. At least the prime rib itself was really soft. Tip for Miku: try replacing this main with a wagyu beef or something. 'Cause considering the 3 bills I dropped on dinner, this was just sad.   4th course: Sushi assortment This was probably the best part of the whole kaiseki experience. The salmon aburi sushi was amazing! It basically melts in your mouth, and the jalapeño is a perfect touch. The most underwhelming piece was the chopped tuna served ikura/uni style. It was just so plain.   Dessert: Green tea opera cake MMMMmMmMmm. This was delicious. It also came with a side of green tea ice cream and tofu whipped cream, which was light and creamy.   The service was great, no complaints here. I really appreciated the kindness of the server, who took the time to walk you through all the components of the dish."}
{"text":"Nice space and service.  The highlight of the dinner was the aburi oshi sushi and drink selection.  Underwhelmed by the Coal Harbour Platter."}
{"text":"Amazing Japanese cuisine! You will be definitely paying premium but you pay for what you get. Freshest fish, amazing presentation. These people take so much pride in the presentation and quality of food.   Our server Hein was very knowledgable and made our dinner awesome!"}
{"text":"Each piece of sushi was beautifully presented and filled with a multi layer of flavor. It wasn't just fish on rice. Their sauces made the taste of each piece pop. No soya sauce needed.   Although the non sushi items were good, the sushi is where it's at. Next time I will stick to just that. The green tea opera dessert was spectacular! As was the green tea ice cream.    Ambience was trendy chic, service very attentive. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The omakase is to die for!! I had the 5 course meal and didn't expect it to be so filling! Reservations are a must. Our servers were super patient and explained our meals to us so kindly. You can tell they were not in a rush to ensure you were having a great experience. The only thing I find weird is the televisions at the bar. I feel like they need to get rid of those to meet their upscale vibe. You really cannot be both an upscale restaurant AND a place for folks to watch the game with beers."}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch. We had a reservation and were seated right away.  The menu is a little confusing so we just ordered based on how many pieces were in the lunch. We all got the premium sushi lunch (with 12 pieces) and had a calamari plate to share.   The calamari was delicious- it involved more than just the regular panko crust that you get in every sushi restaurant in Toronto. There was some green seasoning in it and the crust felt more substantial. It came with Brussels sprouts (which were great) as well as a squid ink sauce which really punched up the flavour.   The premium sushi was great as well. It was presented very well and it's the stuff that involves tweezers in the kitchen. I would say that Miku is more fusion- it's definitely not sushi for the purist. But that's what made it special and the flavours were all very well-balanced and the fish was fresh.   All in all it was a great dining experience but I would still say it's a little overpriced."}
{"text":"We decided to do the Mike 5 course menu.  First course was a sashimi appetizer that was amazing.  Everything was so fresh bright. The second course was a trio of appetizers. Oysters, tuna tartar, and seared scallop. It was all delicious but if I had to choose a favorite it was the tartar. The seasoning was spot on. Third course was prime rib with roasted summer squash and mushroom. We were surprised at how big the portion was. That in itself would have been enough as a meal on it's one. Then came the sushi course - wonderful.  I will have to go back to try more of aburi style sushi. Finally the desserts. They were so pretty but at that point we were so full.  I would definitely recommend this place and the tasting menu. Now I can return and order my favorites."}
{"text":"A more puritan sushi experience. The saki was delicious. Our waiter was patient and courteous with our questions, us being unfamiliar with some of the items on the menu or what to expect. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Get their premium Negri set !! Great service and great atmosphere! Will definitely come again"}
{"text":"Game Changing! Amazing!   This place has set a new benchmark for me. I literally salivate thinking about when I can go there again. It's soooo good. Their technique (searing with flame / flavor infused rice leaves a lasting impression and taste one craves!"}
{"text":"Miku is one of my favourite Sushi spot in downtown Toronto. The waiters and waitresses are super detail-oriented and patient and they make sure your allergies are taken care of. The place is clean and bright and there are two private dining rooms available if you want to celebrate special occasions.  Take off one star because their toilet was clogged the last time I was there and no one seemed like taking care of that."}
{"text":"I work in the building so I have been here a few times. It's a little pricey and I don't usually like flame seared sushi but somehow I still love this place. The sablefish is delicious (I believe it's the same thing as black cod) and I will usually add this to share on the side with one of their sushi assortments. It's not a very traditional take on sushi but all very well done with great ingredients. Very unique cocktail list as well with more exotic ingredients, highly recommend trying one with dinner!"}
{"text":"Beautiful environment, professional and charming servers, mesmerizing sushi chefs, and INCREDIBLY delicious food!  So happy to have come here. Each dish was artistic and so fresh. The star was the aburi oshi sushi!  Will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"My go-to place in downtown Toronto, whether it's for a special occasion or just to spoil myself.  I've been here for maybe 7 times now, had about a third of the menu, here's the break down:  The aburi is amazing, especially the pressed prawn one. This is a must order every single time, each time I've ordered it there's obviously a bit of variance in taste and texture (sometimes even the temperature), but it has never been less than \"very good\".  The scallop sashimi here seems different from every other place I've been to in Toronto. It's as fresh as frozen? sashimi can get, to be honest I couldn't tell at all whether or not it was frozen. It's a very refreshing dish with a naturally sweet scent that goes perfectly with the soy sauce and a bit of wasabi. Ordered this every time, it has only tasted less than perfection once (slightly slimy once).   The chorizo octopus appetizer.. Oh my god I wish literally any other restaurant could make this and have it cheaper because then I would go to said restaurant all the time. The most tender octopus I've had in my life with a unique sauce on the side paired with some diced chorizo sausages. Only ordered this twice, relatively new discovery for me here, not sure how consistently they make this dish. When it's on point, you'll know, because it will taste SO MUCH BETTER than any octopus you've had anywhere else cooked in any way.  The dessert is probably the best dessert I've had in my life. You can't go wrong with either the lava cake (even though they refuse to call it that, it is what it is) nor the mochi. Just try it, I have huge dessert enthusiast friends that would agree.  One thing to note: it costs me roughly 100 dollars every time I come here to get filled up (I do eat a bit more than the average person). Is it worth it? 100 times yes."}
{"text":"Despite giving only 48 hours notice (instead of the required 72 hours) of ordering the Miku omakase, Miku staff was very nice about it and accommodated for our meal. First thing was that I had to sign a waiver with credit card info plus a chart of foods we preferred/did not prefer. Serious stuff! And when we arrived, I was promptly greeted and given a sealed white envelope for \"Lesley & Guest\" written on it. Inside was a birthday card, wishing my guest and I an enjoyable meal. What sorcery is this?!   I think that's the best part of Miku and what sets it above other aburi/torch-style sushi spots in the city. They had really excellent service. Attentive (without being intrusive), friendly, and very knowledgeable. The sushi chef himself came out to explain the sushi course and each piece. At the end, they also asked for our thoughts and whether there were any standout dishes that we'd want to repeat again...so that if we came back for the Miku set again, we would never have to repeat the same menu twice unless we specifically wanted to.   The food was fresh, of great quality, featured seasonal ingredients, and was meticulously plated. I can't imagine ordering the set all the time (at the end of the day, I must admit that the dishes weren't so novel that I haven't had them or something similar elsewhere), but the dishes were thoughtful, well executed, and I think it's worth the experience at least once."}
{"text":"Was treated for dinner here and boy ...was it yummy!!  We had a boat of sashimi, oysters, mussels and some other fancy Japanese side dishes!  We also got two orders of the salmon oshi sushi because it's just so dang good!!  The service was okay - servers were polite and explained what was what when our food came but it wasn't over the top as I would expect for a place at this price point.  Sake selection was also meh...I wanted a warm sake cuz it's cold outside but they didn't have any good ones (said the server).  We went with a cold one that he recommended instead and I wouldn't say it was memorable.  Place was spacious and modern looking - very clean as well!  Overall - 4 stars for good food and a nice spot to splurge, but not over the top amazing that I would come running back if I had more money than what I knew what to do with!"}
{"text":"Sugoi oishii desu ne!!!  When we walked in, everyone shouted \"irasshaimase!!!\" (Japanese welcome when entering into a shop) which was unexpected but a pleasant surprise lol.   The first thing I noticed, upon arrival, was the chicness of the restaurant. The decor is slick, modern, minimalist and cool. Service was great. They really paid attention to detail and were prompt.   It was our first time visiting this establishment and our waitress, Kat, really made sure to give us a great run down on the dishes. Whenever we were brought a dish, an explanation followed as well.  Finally, the food itself was soooooooo good. Every course was better than the next. We started with shrimp tempura (which wasn't on the menu but they had no problem making it). It really set the tone and excited us for what was coming next. Then we had oysters (Yum!). Next came the calamari (Yumm!). Soft shell crab roll (Yummm!). Sashimi/Nigiri salmon (Yummmm! like a cloud melting in your mouth). Finally, my favorite item that I tried that day, the salmon oshi sushi (HEAVEN in your mouth).  I would definitely recommend trying this place and I will obviously go back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch for my one year anniversary with my bf; and we loved it. Would def recommend to any friend looking to eat high end sushi. The torched sushi was amazing, and the Zen appetizer is a must get!!!   Overall: great for special occasions, dates, and anniversaries! I would definitely say the quality of the food IS worth the price;;   Hands down my favourite sushi place in all of Toronto!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Very different and innovative.  Wayyyy over-priced for what it is. Not best atmosphere. I would go back but in a few years"}
{"text":"I love everything that this place has to offer; top notch service, the subtle ambiance, and the quality of the food.  Everything always tastes soooo good. My go to are; beef carpaccio, red wave and miku roll, soft shell crab roll, all the pressed oshisushis, and ofc the extravagant seafood boat. Cannot wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight with my boyfriend for our anniversary. I was really excited to try out this place because of all the hype that's been going around.   This restaurant is really big and the atmosphere is great for a date night. Decor is really pretty and modern. Our server was also really great as well.   Started off with the beef carpaccio as the appetizer. For the main, we had the salmon and saba oshi sushi. We then ordered the red wave roll, miku roll and spider roll. We did half orders of each (except the spider roll as it had to come in a full order). It was nice that they had this option as we were able to try more things on their menu. As for the dessert, we ordered the Green Tea Opera. I think my favourite of the night would be the Miku roll.   However, for the price - the taste and quality of the sushi was only alright to me. This place actually tastes really similar to a Japanese restaurant close to me - Le Modern Japanese Cuisine which is in Markham. Hence, I probably would not come back here as I can pretty much eat the same things at Le Modern. As for pressed sushi and special rolls, I think I would definitely prefer Jabistro over Miku as prices are similar but the quality at Jabistro is that much better."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Miku for winterlicious. We had a good meal. The sashimi are great quality. I love the aburi sushi plate."}
{"text":"What a treat.  New favourite Japanese spot in Toronto, located along the Harbourfront, with beautiful décor, great service, and most importantly, great food. Miku's food is not only tasty, but truly an ART.   From beginning to end we loved everything about our experience.  We made reservations here ahead of time. We were seated promptly upon entering the restaurant and given our menus right away and great menu suggestions since we were new comers.   We ordered:  Coal Harbour Platter (Regular, $33.00)  Premium Sushi Lunch ($29.00) Miku Zen with the Dessert Option ($35.75) Deconstructed Pina Colada & Essence of Yuzu ($14.00)  The service had great attention to detail, and the food was absolutely amazing, we left with our taste buds tingling. Our favourite was the Premium Sushi Lunch, and the deconstructed Pina Colada dessert. Absolute beauty.   I'm literally speechless with how good everything was, and we cannot wait to come here again and try the Kaiseki at dinner."}
{"text":"We order fish and chips for appetizer, spicy soba and premium aburi sushi for entrée. Fish and chips was ok, the fish was thick but it had that kind of fishy taste. Spicy soba was the best, it comes with fresh seafood and the noodle itself tasted amazing, me and my husband totally loved it. The aburi sushi was not bad, but JaBistro would has better aburi sushi. Service was good."}
{"text":"Miku offers good quality fish and a modern-fusion take on sushi. However, if you are craving more traditional sushi experience (spicy salmon rolls, salmon avacado rolls etc. with laid back servie) this is not the place for you. The wait staff were all very friendly and knowledgeable but I did find the experience a bit pretentious ex. how the servers tell you that certain dishes aren't served with soy sauce, despite asking for it. The overall experience seems more fitting for people who can expense a meal on the company card or people who like things for the sake of something being expensive vs. an experience that appeals to a foodie (if that makes sense).   Overall Miku offers a solid experience, however in terms of quality I would recommend Nami sushi or sushi couture in the Annex instead of Miku, both of those restaurants offer a wider selection of fish that is higher quality at a lower price point."}
{"text":"We had a solid meal here last week. I also had a cocktail, which wasn't amazing, but it was pretty good. The service was very prompt and efficient. Waitress and servers were all friendly and knowledgeable. Pork belly served with the scallops was so good. You only get three scallops though, so we opted for one more, which was $6. I thought the calamari was really well done--tasty and crispy! The salmon oshi sushi was awesome, much better than the miku roll, which I thought was average. You should definitely get dessert because it was excellent. My only complaint is that there were lots of flies in there. I guess because they open the doors, but in a restaurant it's a turn off. It's also expensive, which was expected, but I don't know--not sure it's worth it for me. I didn't walk away thinking wow, that was amazing! It was more like--okay, that was really good and I'm satisfied."}
{"text":"Great staff and great entree and dessert!!  As for pressed sushi, it wasn't anything special.  I would recommend another place but don't want to stray any business from Miku.  This place is good but poorly located for me to come back again."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Toronto. Unique in how they make their Sushi, lots of detail and great taste. Not like any other sushi spot in Toronto. On top of that, Excellent service! Great vibe whether you sit inside or on the patio..Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"Miso soup was amazing!  Spicy edamame was not that good.  Red wave rolls were excellent!  Environment was great.  A really good happy hour crowd even on a Wednesday."}
{"text":"In short, not as good as Ja Bistro! But, there is a little more variety.   Directly comparing the pressed sushi, rolls, and quality of fresh sashimi, I think Ja Bistro wins hands down.   Miku is ever so slightly more affordable.   Overall, good service, nice ambiance and a good experience so it's definitely worth checking out at least once."}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi place I've been to in Toronto.  If you're looking for a mouth watering, tasty savouring fresh fish with a modern style cooking, this is your place.   Make sure you book a reservation."}
{"text":"We've finally found a restaurant that does Winterlicious without letting their quality and service suffer. I'm amazed. Everyone from the host, to the coat check person, to the servers were professional and friendly. The aburi sushi chef was at an open counter near our table and we were able to watch him prepare dishes. The ambience felt intimate and cozy even though the place itself is quite spacious. Our server was attentive and each dish was explained in detail.   The aburi sushi was heaven. Each one was a unique experience that I wish went on for longer. My favourites were the salmon oshi and the one topped with caramelized onions, the name escapes me. This is fusion food, folks. The miso baked sable fish and yuzu butter poached half lobster tail were delicious. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the fish more than the lobster. The fish was just so light and perfectly done as to almost melt in your mouth.   Lastly, the green tea opera. The cake was a perfect blend of matcha, adzuki bean cream, and dark chocolate. The hazelnut wafer gave it a bit of a crunch. The matcha ice cream was a great side to an already great dessert. I also tried the chocolate croissant bread pudding. Game changer. Get it. Get both! Get all the desserts!  We had a wonderful experience. I'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious - in particular, chose lunch as I felt it offered a better deal / bang for buck. For only $33, I was able to sample the sashimi plate, signature aburi sushi, and green tea opera cake. It was so delicious!  I started with the sashimi plate, while my roommate ordered the Miku Zen (four small plates). The restaurant was very accommodating and switched the Alberta short ribs to fried fish and chips, as my roommate is pescetarian and cannot eat meat. She thoroughly enjoyed her appetizer, while I felt that the sashimi I had was super fresh. Every piece was perfectly al dente and portioned. Not too large or small by any means. I particularly enjoyed the red tuna - you can immediately tell that the quality is infinitely better than other shops.  We both got the aburi plate, which is Miku's signature sushi. That said, I wasn't a huge fan... The fatty tuna, the otoro, was by far my favourite, but I felt that the fresh taste of the fish was overpowered by the complex sauces added (e.g., the Kewpie mayo). The salmon aburi is their most famous one, but I found it likewise overdressed.  The green tea opera cake, however, was a showstopper! It takes three days to make and is composed of 7 distinct layers. There's a sesame brittle, red bean layer, green tea mousse and ganache. Personally, I found it slightly on the sweet side, but when served with the green tea ice cream, it was the perfect balance and sweet and bitter. Absolutely amazing, and would definitely order again a la carte!  The service is also impeccable and so friendly. Can't wait to come again to try their a la carte options."}
{"text":"Trendy upscale downtown sushi. Beautiful, creative, interesting and overpriced.  Excellent service. Exactly what you'd expect. Great for business lunch or after-work bite & drinks but too pretentious to be a go-to."}
{"text":"Just a pure bad experience. No one cared about us for 15-20 minutes after we sat down. 5 different servers walked past our table without offering anything or looking at us."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best meal I've ever had in Toronto. This is the first time I'm giving a restaurant 5 stars as the whole experience was a pleasure- from the superb service to the freshest sashimi I've had in the city, to the presentation of each dish. It was a dream come true. I will be coming back for sure. I can't even recommend just one dish because it would be unfair. Every dish we had was incredible. We ordered the aburi, premium, sashimi lunch, salmon oshi to share amongst the four of us. The only thing that disappointed me was the rice that came with the sashimi lunch- I wish it was sushi rice. For dessert we had Green tea opera and the matcha chocolate fondant. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came to Miku as part of a celebratory meal. The meal was enjoyable, but the only item that left strong impression were its torched pressed sushi. This particular dish, I had not found the same flavour and impressive construct anywhere else"}
{"text":"Uncomfortably fancy restaurant. Food was amazing and aesthetic. Server is very attentive and professional."}
{"text":"Been here twice already and I must say, my second visit was much better than the first. I didn't know what to expect the first time I went and ordered whatever sounded good. Now, I know better.   The Aburi Prime was amazing, every piece handcrafted to cater to your taste buds. Their fish is amazingly fresh and well crafted. We also ordered a plate of hotate sashimi and it was heavenly. I did not enjoy the Kaisen Soba Peperoncino however, it wasn't as nicely flavoured as their other dishes.  Their drinks are also amazing. I feel like their drinks are specially crafted to suit the style of their restaurant and both drinks we had (The Takeover and Aburi Pearl) were so delightful.  For dessert, we ordered the Warm Matcha Chocolate Fondant and it was sooooooo good. Please order this. It's not overly sweet and that melt in your mouth goodness is perfection.  I would definitely come back but probably on a special occasion as it's not easy to dish out $300 meals every week!"}
{"text":"Had the sashimi plate for lunch here and found it pretty good, it has a good ambience and more into Japanese fusion style, i ask the waiter what class was their tuna sashimi but was not able to gove that anser, service was good and will definitely coming back (will try the dinner service next)"}
{"text":"Amazing taste and service! Had the Miku Zen, Aburi, Miku Roll, and miso-salted caramel and Jasmine tea ice cream!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with Miku in Vancouver when I are there 3 1/2 years ago and go every time I'm out West. So I was super excited when they finally opened here after what seemed like an endless delay. It's pretty spot on to YVR taste wise for the aburi and the cooked Zen sampler we tried. I love the salmon aburi! The green tea opera cake is amazing - love the intensity of the matcha green tea ice cream and refined complexity of all the tastes in the cake."}
{"text":"The grilled octopus was an innovative dish. The sushi was innovative refreshingly good. I highly recommend this place for anyone to try unconventional Japanese cuisine. The atmosphere of the restaurant was pleasant and the staff were very attentive."}
{"text":"Went here for my girlfriend's birthday, and tried their set meal. We started off with  a couple of appetizers selected from their menu, and they were all really good! I wasn't a big fan of the aburi sushi though, I really only liked the sashimi. But that's just me. For the main course I got the miso baked sable fish while my FI got the prime rib. Unfortunately my sable fish was actually over cooked and a bit burnt as well. Really wasn't impressed with that....but my FI's prime rib was delicious! It was cooked perfectly to a medium rare. We then had the famous green tea opera cake. The cake was wayyyy smaller than what I expected. When it was split among 8 people, we ended up with a slice that is about 7-8 cm long and about 5 cm wide.....It was seriously so small. But it was the most delicious thing I had at the dinner. Overall it was a nicely decorated restaurant, with amazing service. But it's one of those places where I will only go once."}
{"text":"Miku has quickly become my favourite sushi restaurant in Toronto. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and I am so happy he did! Every piece of sushi was amazing. The aburi sushi just melts in your mouth. The sashimi is of very high quality.  Even the dessert is amazing. The molten lava cake is to die for. Definitely a must try! Can't wait to come back. The price is obviously higher than other sushi restaurants but I think it's worth it when you want to treat yourself!"}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Aburi style sushi (slightly seared sashimi on top of rice), this is definitely the place to visit. I heard a lot about Miku Toronto and definitely had high expectations going in. Miku completely exceeded my foodie, high expectations by a long shot.  For appetizers, my party tried the spicy steamed edamame, aonori tempura calamari, miso marinated tofu salad. The spicy steamed edamame was not soggy and has a great spicy kick to it. I am not a fan of edamame in general but I kept eating this cause it was good. The tempura calamari was crispy and goes well with the tosazu sauce. Finally, the tofu salad was fresh and I found it was interesting that they added the crispy tempeh. The dish presentation for all three dishes were amazing.  A lot of yelpers recommended the Miku roll so I definitely had to try it and those yelpers are spot on. I love that they are rolled in tobiko (fish eggs) and it adds a great uniqueness to differentiate it from a common maki/roll.   Of course, my party had to order all three aburi oshi sushi. Salmon Oshi Sushi, Ebi Oshi Sushi and Saba Oshi sushi were all flavourful and each have their distinguishable taste. The presentation of the sushi was incredible too just like sushi art. When I first saw it, I did not want to eat it! I've tried aburi sushi from other places but this place is definitely ranked number one.  We also tried the aburi sashimi selection. The presentation of this dish was jaw-dropping as I did not want to dig in. Even though I enjoyed this dish, I prefer the aburi sushi over aburi sashimi.  After all these dishes, we ordered our mains and I got the AAA Sterling Silver Prime Rib. The prime rib was tender and the blew my expectations as well since who knew a Japanese restaurant can serve a good prime rib, right? The baked potato puree was a bit dry though.  And finally, the dessert. Usually restaurants do a great job on appetizers and main dishes but lack behind on the dessert. You think that right?  However, Miku Toronto saves the best for last. The Green Tea Opera is definitely one of the best desserts I've ever had. After one bite, it blew my mind with a food explosion. It was crunchy yet savoury at the same time. The green tea flavour was pretty strong as it complements well with the layers of wafer. Definitely a MUST order for sure!!!  Service was exceptional. When we sat down, our server explained where Miku started from and told us what they are well known for which is their aburi oshi sushi. He also asked if there were any allergy and dietary restrictions so he can inform the kitchen. He did not miss anything that we ordered since we ordered a lot. The atmosphere was great. The restaurant has a great modern look and feel to it especially if you sit in the sushi bar.  Overall, Miku Toronto definitely moved my foodie expectations even higher as everything they served had phenomenal dish presentation and flavours. I definitely will be back someday."}
{"text":"Get the salmon oburi - it's completely worth it. It's salmon layered with rice and looks like a rectangular sushi roll. The red wave roll is also a good food choice.  Great spot for date night."}
{"text":"Aburi oshi salmon was delicious. The taste and texture was perfect..just melts in your mouth. Prime rib and poached lobster was good too but no wow factor. I would just try their dessert and other famous aburi sushi next time..that's their specialty anyway. Spicy edamame was addictive for the initial tAste but after taste is just plain edamame.  We walked in on a Sunday night around 630pm and it was packed and fully booked (dining area). Luckily, they were nice enough to find a table for us which was reserved for 8pm and told us we have 1.5 hours to finish , which was fine as we finished within an hour . Customer service was great but wished the waiter checking up on us every 10 minutes or so."}
{"text":"Miku changed Sushi for me! I will definitely return in a heartbeat. I loved the ambience, the staff was knowledgeable and polite, the decor was elegant and the booths were sophisticated and comfortable. A great place to meet for a business lunch or just hanging out with friends. The Kaisen Coal Harbour platter, Salmon Oshi Sushi & Red Wave Roll is beyond delicious and worth every dollar. Their flame-seared coal technique is working! Thanks for making me a Miku addict."}
{"text":"I really like that Miku has a good portion of their seafood to be Ocean Wise, as well as be of great quality.  I brought my parents here and they also had a great time and enjoyed the food.  The set  kaiseki dinners along with their special dinner provided a great deal of variety and quality.  I'd do 1 kaiseki and a smattering of other varieties to focus on the things I like most when we come back.  Yup, we'd come back.  Service was also very good.  A bit slow on the food, but quality can take time, even when it's raw."}
{"text":"Very upscale and elegant sushi place.  The services was excellent as the staff came to us a few times and asked if we need anything or explain the menu.  Got the tempura calamari to start. It was okay. We ordered a few rolls which is very good but pricey compare to the average Japanese restaurants.  The Red Wave roll is amazing and my favorite.  Miku roll was bland didn't taste much of the flavors. (8 pieces per roll). Next we got 2 aburi torched sushi (6 pieces per roll). The salmon torched sushi was very good as well as the aburi mackerel was tasty as well.  I enjoyed 3/4 rolls.  Seating was very comfortable and decor is very modern."}
{"text":"Second Winterlicious for us at Miku. Good food and beautifully place. Enjoyed the food with eyes and mouth!   Although price increase from 28 to 33. It is worth the experience!  Green Tea Opera as desert were perfect! Not too sweet just right for my liking. I guess the opera is due to multiple layer of different ingredients works together!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice. It's very trendy and feels classy. The servers are very attentive and enthusiastic about the food here... like really enthusiastic.  Ebi Fritters - White tiger prawns, herb-beer battered, sweet chili aioli, chili powder, soy-balsamic reduction  - I still prefer me some shrimp tempura over this, especially in regards to the batter. Not worth the $14 price tag. We ordered this due to our highly enthusiastic server who kept raving about this appetizer.  Salmon Oshi Sushi -Pressed BC wild sockeye salmon, jalapeno, Miku Sauce -This was just so-so. The salmon was not flavourful enough. And because there was way too much rice than fish, you can't really taste the fish much. The jalapeno gave it a good kick though.  Saba Oshi Sushi - Pressed house-cured mackerel, Miso sauce - Really loved this. If I were to come back here, this is one thing I'd definitely order again. The aburi on the mackerel just brought out full-on flavours and the sauce what subtle enough to enhance the fish without overpowering it  Miku Roll - Sockeye salmon, crab, uni, cucumber, rolled in tobiko, Miku sauce - This is pretty much similar or the same as JaBistro's signature roll, Jabistroll. However, for some reason, I liked JaBistroll way better. There was just something off with the execution here such that the ingredients didn't synergize as a whole. It ended up feeling like there was so much going on in one piece.  Green Tea Opera - green tea genoise, matcha butter cream, dark chocolate ganache, adzuki bean cream, hazelnut wafer, matcha ice cream - This is more unique and apparently it takes 7 days take (not too sure why though). Really liked the overall taste of the cake. But can pretty much only taste the matcha and bean cream."}
{"text":"My first MIku visit was in Vancouver.  Loved the aburi sushi and the service was absolutely top notch - and anyone who knows me can tell you that I'm very critical of service.  So when I saw Miku Toronto was taking part in Winterlicious, could not resist.  $28 for lunch and it was 100% worth it.  Both DC and I walked away stuffed (but not in a sickly way) and very satisfied.  Service was great but didn't wow me as much as Vancouver, although it's pretty hard to live up to that standard.  If you haven't had it before, aburi sushi is basically torch seared nigiri.  There are only a handful of places that serves it in Toronto, one being JaBistro where the chef spent time at Miku Vancouver.    If you like sushi, do yourselves a favour and try out aburi sushi at Miku.  For what it's worth, their desserts were divine as well."}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype about Miku, I had high expectations of this new sushi joint in town. Stepped inside, interior was great, so was service and presentation but food wasn't. Sushi was fresh but overpriced for a sub-par Aburi. Still not better than Ja :("}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening and it wasn't too busy.  Pros: - Nice ambiance - Good service  Cons: - Extremely pricey for the quality and quantity offered. - Portions are tiny - Food was sub par"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Miku for a Winterlicious dinner on Saturday night and we lucky to walk in and get a seat at the bar! The ambience was lovely and we had front row seats to the raw bar! Everything about this meal was perfect, from the starter all the way to the dessert. Every individual component was exquisitely plated and delightfully flavourful!  The aburi sushi was perfectly prepared and very fresh! Their miku sauce is sublime.. The charred aubergine paste on my main course was unforgettable! I would go back just for that alone!  To top all this off, the service was top notch! We cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is a stone's throw from moi. All the previously planned trips didn't pan out somehow as one way or the other they ended up being canceled or I had to join midway. Not being the one to take excuses and wanting to support a neighborhood business I made sure there weren't any distractions i.e. just me and my Amex on this meal :)   I had tried a few of their aburri items on a prior visit and some friends who had dined here commented the cooked items are good here.  The Zen combo caught my eye as you get to taste 4 of their non sushi items and you also get to try the the signature matcha opera for an up charge. I showed up for a late lunch and they weren't that busy (reservations are highly recommended for evening specially on the weekend). I was given an option to sit in the patio or dine inside I chose the former. The service here is immaculate from start to finish so kudos for that and also commendable is the kitchen which I have witnessed to be a well oiled machine as sat with a YEB on a prior trip. Being a fan of productivity on the production floors one good sign is the lack of chatter on the work area when a group of people are working together (the kitchen had almost no chatter on the hour I spent sitting at the bar) so bravo to the staff and the people in charge.  Now for the main attraction hmm I am not a fan of aburi style of sushi so my view is biased already. It didn't impress (if you like this style by all means give them a try). The samplers were OK (Salad was decent) and the matsutake mushroom was wasted IMO as a condiment on the other dish. Forgettable chicken and tempura as well.  The dessert is very good and worth a detour IMO if you like matcha. Just gorgeous and one can see all the effort that must have gone is putting it together so a 4.5 star here for dessert. They are priced on the high side for lunch (dinner prices are high as well from what I have been told)  When one factors in the price I would be hard pushed to give a 3 star as the food didn't impress at all."}
{"text":"After reading some good review on yelp, we decided to try it for lunch. Its near the financial district, so its good for ppl like us working in this area. We order the tempura fish n chips (which is just normal ..) and also 4 types of rolls for sharing, including the soft shell, miku , aburi and saba aburi... for two ppl, the total bill come up to 123 after tips.. very expensive. The place is crowded during lunch and we didnt make reservation so we sat on sushi bar. So many staffs working in the kitchen, around 30 i guess..  The food is not that bad , but definitely worse than other sushi place , like Jabistro. I am very disappointed about the waiters, looks like they are all new and not trained . They cannot explain whats inside the sushi and they messed up with our bill.  I do not recommend people to go there for lunch, its slow and expensive..."}
{"text":"There is so much to like about Miku, but somehow it still misses the mark.   The ambiance is great, and the presentation is spectacular (read: Instagram worthy). The freshness and quality of the fish itself is also top notch. What I didn't like are all the fancy fixings on the popular sushi items on the menu. I'm a bit of a sushi purist and I am not too crazy about seeing a dollop of bacon marmalade on my salmon sushi. Some of the toppings like the zesty lime mayo/cheese on the ebi oshi zushi are awesome, but the rest of them had a little to much happening on and around the humble nigiris.   Non-dressed up sushi items are also available such as  wagyu beef, otoro etc., but these come at a market price and will easily set you back $8-10 per piece.   The other issue was the large amount of rice packed into the ohshi (box style sushi). Too much of it can and does happen very quickly. Last, but not the least, Miku is NOT cheap and will cost you a pretty penny.   Is it worth it? If you don't mind parting with money for overly dressed up sushi, then yes. Definitely give it a try. It's not the only place in Toronto to try Aburi style (blowtorched) shushi, but if you've never had it before give it a shot. Also Miku is a good place to take some who hasn't tried a lot of sushi, or generally isn't very fond of sushi, as the \"dressed up\" sushi is a great way to ease beginners into the idea of eating raw fish."}
{"text":"A Japanese restaurant that does not have rice should be all I need to say. Their fish is fresh and sake selection decent, but it is really overpriced for what you get. I was simply speechless when I could not order steamed rice to go with my sashimi, as for some strange reason they decided not to offer it. The menu overall is very limited and oddly configured. If a you are looking to have a high quality splurge Japanese meal, there are definitely better options than this unjustifiably pretentious one."}
{"text":"Miku is a high end Japanese-American restaurant that is beautifully elegant in interior design. The food isn't bad either.   I have to say that Miku is not a traditional Japanese sushi place. It caters to a more western clientele. Take a quick look at the menu, and you'll see phrases such as \"Fish and Chips\" and \"AAA Sterling Silver Prime Rib\". Point made.   That's not saying Miku doesn't have any good traditional Japanese food. They have the usual sashimi plates, rolls, and nigiri found in restaurants such as JaBistro and Yuzu-no-Hana. And Miku is just as good as the two previously mentioned restaurants. In fact, I actually preferred the aburi at Miku than JaBistro!  This is what I ordered on lunch for Valentines day-  Premium sushi lunch: We each got one so we didn't have to share ;) It comes with a sampler of pressed sushi, aburi, nigiri and their red wave roll. No complaints at all, as every piece was delicious, except for their pressed ebi one. They gave us cocktail shrimp...  Regardless the pressed salmon here is amazing. The torched flavour combined with their \"Miku sauce\" have a great initial taste. The red wave roll with real crab meat was also very delicious. I strongly recommend this lunch order for value, taste and experience at Miku. 4.5/5  Miku roll: This roll is excellent and looks exactly like JaBistro's Jabistroll except it is slightly lacking in favour when compared to JaBistro's. I feel like they use less uni and less fish roe. Still great and a strong recommendation. 4/5.   Matcha chocolate fondant: Everyone on Yelp raves about Miku's desserts...and for good reason. This dessert was absolutely delicious, and I would say the highlight of the meal. It's strange to say that dessert was the best thing at a Japanese sushi restaurant, but I've already stated that Miku was more Americanized than they want you to think. Anyways, this matcha cake was filled with white/dark chocolate filling and worked really well with the jasmine ice cream and jelly. 5/5. Get a dessert.   Very cool place. I wouldn't come to Miku if I was looking for a true Japanese experience. I'd go back to Yasu for that. But this place is great for dates, company outings (explains why they're on the PATH) and family dinners. Just don't bring the children, get a babysitter."}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0  After opening their first location in Vancouver, it has finally made its way over to the heart of downtown Toronto.  Came here during the week of their grand opening with great expectations given the success they have had with their original location.  Restaurant was very spacious and modern with a blend of traditional Japanese elements.   We ordered a few of their signature items and everything was on point.   Service was great and waitresses were very polished and knowledgable with every aspect of the menu including the sake selections.   Pricing definitely matched up with the quality and service that they deliver."}
{"text":"What brought me to Miku Restaurant Toronto is a Grade 11 French project where we researched and tested green initiatives in Toronto. For weeks, I researched the things Miku Toronto does to save our environment. These include the adoption of the Vivreau water filtration system meant to reduce pollution caused by the transportation of water bottles and the waste left after the bottles are used. Another green initiative Mike Toronto takes is the Ocean Wise certification given to dishes that are helpful in sustaining the marine environment.   During my trip to Miku Toronto, I was greeted very well and the waiters and waitresses happily answered any questions I had for them about Miku's green initiatives. I was able to enjoy a great meal while being in a friendly, green environment.  Speaking of meals, the one I had at Miku Toronto was great! The item I ordered is the Ocean Wise certified premium sushi lunch and it included a variety of Miku specialties. These include traditional nigiri, Aburi nigiri, oshi and sushi rolls. My personal favourite was the Aburi nigiri. While I did like the other items on my plate, the Aburi nigiri had a very distinct taste that I really enjoyed. I also got the Vivreau filtered water and it did taste slightly superior to regular bottled water. The only drawback from this whole experience was that the price was a bit high for a high schooler such as myself  In conclusion, Miku Toronto is a great place for any special occasion or for anyone looking to eat quality Japanese cuisine. It is also more appealing than most other sushi restaurants since they are doing their best to operate their business more sustainably.  En Français:  Ce qui m'a amené au restaurant Miku Toronto est un projet français de 11e année où nous avons étudié et testé des initiatives écologiques à Toronto. Pendant des semaines, j'ai fait des recherches sur les choses que Miku Toronto fait pour sauver notre environnement. Ceux-ci incluent l'adoption du système de filtration d'eau Vivreau destiné à réduire la pollution causée par le transport des bouteilles d'eau et les déchets laissés après l'utilisation des bouteilles. Une autre initiative écologique de Mike Toronto est la certification Ocean Wise accordée aux plats qui aident à préserver l'environnement marin. Pendant mon voyage à Miku Toronto, j'ai été très bien accueilli et les serveurs et les serveuses ont répondu avec plaisir à toutes les questions que je leur posais concernant les initiatives écologiques de Miku. J'ai pu profiter d'un bon repas tout en étant dans un environnement amical et vert. En parlant de repas, celui que j'ai eu à Miku Toronto était super! L'article que j'ai commandé est le sushi premium certifié Ocean Wise et il comprenait une variété de spécialités Miku. Ceux-ci incluent le nigiri traditionnel, l'aburi nigiri, l'oshi et les rouleaux de sushi. Mon préféré était le nigiri Aburi. Même si j'ai aimé les autres articles de mon assiette, le nigiri Aburi avait un goût très distinct que j'ai vraiment apprécié. J'ai également obtenu l'eau filtrée Vivreau et elle avait un goût légèrement supérieur à l'eau embouteillée ordinaire. Le seul inconvénient de cette expérience était que le prix était un peu élevé pour un lycéen comme moi-même En conclusion, Miku Toronto est un endroit idéal pour toute occasion spéciale ou pour ceux qui cherchent à manger une cuisine japonaise de qualité. Il est également plus attrayant que la plupart des autres restaurants de sushi car ils font de leur mieux pour exploiter leur entreprise de façon plus durable."}
{"text":"I'd give this place and average rating. The food was good but not amazing. I guess I'm comparing this place to Japango which is another sushi restaurant down at Elizabeth and Dundas. I mean if you would have to compare both restaurants, Japango would be a bang for the buck. Japango is a little less expensive but the quality is on point oppose to coming to this place and paying more, you'd expect that the quality of the food would be far more superior. Also, the taste was just okay and nothing too special. The sushi was just subpar and honestly didn't leave a lasting impression on me. I think the reason why this place is hyped is due to its location and the vibe that it tries to give, which is it's suppose to be a high end restaurant and it makes you feel fancy. Ask yourself this, by dressing up and looking fancy does that make the quality and taste of the food any better?  Taste with your mouth and not your eyes."}
{"text":"The server AJ is really rude. Ruined my experience at Miku today!  I got the holiday set. The amount of food I get worth the price I pay, even though it was not extraordinary. Would not recommend friends to come here."}
{"text":"Miku is one of the place that i don't feel bad on spending $100 for dinner for one...I have been here many times and always satisfy on the quality of their foods. They have THE BEST sushi around! Aburi sashimi and aburi sushi were the best, everything on the plates tasted super delicious!!(MUST TRY) Their chicken salad was the best i've had.  Their cold oysters was very fresh it came with 3 different sauces and it was so good that i had to order one more. Their dessert the green tea opera was nice but i'm in love with their jasmine tea ice cream lol"}
{"text":"Delicious food, clean environment, friendly staff, and good for business lunches."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on a Saturday with a friend.  first of all... pro: Mad points for the fact that they have \"REAL WASABI\". as in not the paste but the real stuff grated.  con: the menu is smaller on a Saturday.   we had the red wave roll which was amazing. the caramelized onions on top do the magic.  their special pressed sushi is great.  the prawn one is yummy. the rice for the sushi is also different than other places.   the salmon sashimi was wow. pro:  it was not farm raised but wild. hence the darker color. it tasted different than what i eat regularly. .. but very good.  we also had the soba noodle mix seafood stir fry.  it was yummy. we got it done spicy. it was barely spicy.   the chocolate fondant was a great dessert. so many textures and flavors.  some very unexpected. like Jasmine tea jelly. matcha green tea powder. the others like raspberry sauce was good.  the fondant was great.   the service was good as well. since we sat down around 245 pm. restaurant was quite empty by then."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a weekend and did not seem to be that busy.  Got the following; Coal harbour platter- had a mixture of different seafood and came with a few different sauces, but nothing special.  Arubi beef carpaccio - love the combination with shoyu egg  Anorori tempura calamari - batter was decent could be a bit crispier  Prime rib - very tender, however the mash was very greasy ratio of potato and butter was off, was also missing vegetables as the menu stated  Soft shell crab fritter roll - poorly done, the roll was falling apart, for miku to even serve something like that was disappointing (didn't send it back to the kitchen)  Salmon, ebi, and Saba oshi sushi - salmon was my favourite, ebi wasn't as good it was kinda lost in flavour  Hands down dessert was my the best out of all  Green tea opera- different layers of cake from moist and crispy from the hazelnut wafers  matcha chocolate fondant - did not taste any matcha, filling was a molten matcha ganache seem like just a dark chocolate ganache no match taste at all  Ichigo Mochi some - Mochi was very good and chewy, condense milk whip cream taste like regular whip cream to me, would have prefer ice cream in the Mochi instead."}
{"text":"Heard many people recommended this place so decided to give it a try. But actually is not as good as I expected as this is too fusion and more suitable for westerners which love a lot of saucing for the dishes."}
{"text":"This is a tough review to write. I had a $100 gift card to Miku, and without it this review would be two stars, because this was definitely not a $200 dinner experience in my mind.  I requested to sit at the sushi bar for a couple reasons: my husband and I prefer to sit next to each other, and generally the sushi bar is fun because you can interact with the chefs and watch them do amazing work.  Especially at a place known for torched sushi, how fun would that be to watch? We saw nada, however, because they built a concrete two foot wall in front of you at the sushi bar. Makes no sense. So yes we got to sit next to each other, but the sushi bar is near the front entrance and there's no ambiance there.  I found service to be pressured and over eager. Server assistants, managers, our waiter, would sneak up behind us moments after popping a sushi in our mouths and ask if we were enjoying it. The waiter seemed almost angry that we didn't want dessert, ignoring us and launching into a detailed description about which was his favourite choice and why.   The best order of the night was my pick of sake, from Oregon, that was delicious. It was served in a metal bucket...with no ice in it...just a metal bucket for no reason.  That was odd af.   The torched square sushi that Miku is known for was the best. The rest of the sashimi and nigiri we had was mediocre. Not unfresh, just unflavourful. I like adventurous sushi (ikura is my fave) and have been to Japan, so I have an awareness of good sushi and this was not it.  The shari fell apart. No wasabi on anything but I longed for it, to kick up the flavour. Washrooms were pretty but dirty.  Four hosts on at the door, busy talking to one another when we entered. \"Coat check\" just a ploy to get you to tip.  Cocktails were yummy and apparently 2 oz,  but I felt nothing. Our meal was meh, and $205. Thankfully we have the gift card!"}
{"text":"Had the five-course Valentine's Kaiseki menu. The appetizer and dessert courses actually contained three items each and were all outstanding. Appetizers were seared scallop, octopus and kale and sashimi sampler. I particularly love the kale and the sesame/miso seasoning. Main was duck and fois gras. The duck was fine but the fois gras was outstanding. Succulent and meaty. Dessert course had a small piece of their signature green tea opera cake, a chocolate and vanilla creamer brule and a raspberry macaron. I was really looking forward to the opera cake but actually was most blown away by the creme brûlée. The chocolate layer was so flavourful - it tastes like Belgian chocolate in fact.  Service was outstanding, and the pacing of the courses just exactly right. All in all an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"Fancy place to go in a regular basis. $$$$. Friends said Vancouver's is way better than Toronto's but I guess I try it anyway. They are famous for their Aburi Nigiri sushi and I would say it's really special. I love how the way they torched not only the fish on top but also the rice so that it brings out that seared favour. I also love their Grill octopus - so tender !! Last but not least, their homemade Jasmine Tea Ice Cream. it is very refreshing and that Jasmine scent just stays in your mouth. I don't think there's other places that offer this favour."}
{"text":"I went to Miku with a group of 6 last Saturday. The restaurant was huge, the drink list extensive, the service was great.   We ordered several dishes.   Appetizers: I would skip the Kaiso seaweed salad.  The pickled veggies are good if you like pickled things. Beef carpaccio - Beautiful presentation. I didn't have any, but everyone devoured it so it must have been good.   Mains: The AAA Sterling Prime rib - 2/5- large portion and beautifully presented, but was lacking in flavour IMO. It wasn't a nice piece of beef. Too chewy.   Sushi:  The Aburi Oshi sushi was the tastiest of what we ordered. Particularly the ebi oshi sushi which had a refreshing, tangy sauce. 5/5  We also had the aburi sushi sampler - 4/5 -the standout for me here was the salmon. The yellowtail was a bit off.   we had the red wave roll 4/5- fresh and tasty with caramelized onion on top.   Desert  The green tea opera cake is a must 5/5 Warm matcha chocolate fondant - 5/5   I was going to give this a 4, but the steak and the seaweed salad made me change my mind. I would probably return with another group. I love how open and spacious Miku is."}
{"text":"We came here for a early mother's day dinner.   I just have to share that my mom did not eat most of the items but she did enjoy herself for the most part. She generally loves sushi but due to recent events and older age has become quite pragmatic about eating and has never really enjoyed big bold flavours.   We got the Sakura Aburi Prime Menu on it's last day.   Let's go through the run down of the menu and how I experienced them.   The Foie Gras amuse bouche was fatty and buttery, salty and with crispy, and the sweet cherry jam helped to balance the whole dish. The accompanying barley on the bottom added some body and texture with a bit of a bite and almost a pop but kinda difficult to eat off a flat plate with chopsticks.   The Kaiseki Trio was presented in a dome like dish which came apart and presented its own fun presentation. The sashimi was fresh, the hamachi had more body and ate really clean with that sweetness of the fish you get, and the tuna was much softer on the tongue and they had an accompanying traditional soy and sweeter soy to accentuate the fish.   The sable fish is buttery and sumptuous, well seasoned with the miso allowing for a subtle, yet prominent enough sweetness, but also a balanced saltiness that awakens the palate. The accompanying carrots and parsnip puree added a good balance of earthiness to the dish.   The carpaccio was probably my least favourite of the trio and not really for taste but for the difficulty of how I wanted to eat it. The beef stuck together but was beautifully presented. The slight pop of the mustards seeds excited the palate as the notes of bittersweet from the earthy green helped to round out the well seasoned beef. The whole dish became one big glob in my mouth which limited my ability to enjoy the thinness of the beef.   The aburi prime plate was a beautiful plate of 9 individually crafted pieces of sushi some not as good as others as the strong flavours battled a little too much in my mouth. The crab one in the middle was difficult for my family to eat due to the connective cartilage or whatever you call it (really made it messy to handle and remove so that you can enjoy without having to pick them something out of your mouth). Like I said the crab leg, anago, and, maguro with foie and sumomo were not as good for me. The highlight are the soft wagyu beef which my partner confused for fish, the creamy and sweet uni, kobujime offered the most textural delish with the snap pea, the other zuke maguro ate more clean, and the Saba ate without the fishiness or usually meat texture, which for me was a pleasant surprise.   The dessert was a fantastic finish to a delicious and very enjoyable meal. The mint ice cream was subtle and when eaten with the panna cotta gave me the image as if I were eating a whole Sakura blossom. The subtle floral notes of the panna cotta along with the gelée, and the mint ice cream gave almost like a grassy note as if you were eating the leafy bits of a flower. I know it sounds weird but it actually pretty tasty and the calamasi sauce accompanying add a punchy tartness to reawaken and refresh you palate. The bits of nuttiness and the meringue crisps added sugary sweetness added texture and the bit of sugar to a dessert that wasn't too sweet for those who like a sweeter dessert.   The service ate a bit slower that night because the POS system was down and the servers needed to make an adjustment to written orders which also slowed the communication with the kitchen. So our sever can be forgiven for be less than existent that night.   My partner also wanted to add a note here for diners that the overall experience could be improved with some pickled ginger for the aburi prime plate to cleanse the palate between pieces.   I ate here for winterlicous and I can say that the menus on their winterlicious and sumerlicious menus reflect the true menu of what this restaurant has to offer. The presentation of all the dishes has that elegance that even an amateur with a camera can capture above average photos.   I gave this place 4 stars because the price is quite high but you are paying for an experience here and this night though understandable was met with many different hurdles. And with the food being exceptional as it was could always go up another level at least for my taste. But always a wonderful experience dining here and looking forward to coming back.   Any photos of food not mentioned in the review belong to my brother who ordered from the menu. I'll caption those photos."}
{"text":"Their sushi were so good! No soybean sauce or wasabi needed, as they have already been flavored, and they were flavored so well that it didn't cover the taste of fish. The rice was not sticky yet can still melt within your mouth. It was amazing how they were being made this way. Also I like the shape and toppings, which better emphasized the sushi's earthy intensity.  Really a great place to have an elegant sushi meal."}
{"text":"Came here recently for lunch and had much better experience. As I mentioned in my previous review, this is probably because weekdays are not as crazy as Christmas eve night. I ordered the premium sushi for lunch that came with 12 pieces. Includes selection of aburi sushi (salmon, mackerel and 2 pieces of the red wave roll) and nigiri (I don't exactly remember all the names) but everything tasted good (again, some I thought fish wasn't as fresh) but overall, flavours were there and this was a filling lunch. The salmon and mackerel were definitely better this time around and back to how I remember it. Price was $29 for the lunch and came with miso soup.   I had emailed Sasha who had left a comment on my review from Miku after my experience from Christmas eve but surprisingly.. never got a response."}
{"text":"Sushi was impeccable.  Miku surely has style when it comes to serving sushi. Extremely fresh nigiri and the chef's sampler platter is a must if you simply cannot decide.  Over all, excellent experience. Loved the little touches like coat check and the sushi bar chefs welcoming your party in unison."}
{"text":"I came to the restaurant last night and this was in my opinion my best experience in a Toronto restaurant. Delicious food, great atmosphere, service to a tee. Absolutely would recommend  Before I talk about my night, I want to start by defending some of the other comments made. I've been to Japan, I've also been to some of the top sushi restaurants in Toronto like Jabistro. The quality of the food here is great. I feel like a lot of people are simply used to the average sushi restaurants and feel like that is the way it should be done...it's not. Second, this place is pricy, you can see the prices right on the website. It doesn't make sense to me to go to an expensive restaurant and then complain that it's expensive.  To start off the night, we had reservations for 2 at 5pm. We were running late due to traffic and called in. The staff simply told us it was no big deal and get here when we could. We arrive around 5:20 and were seated immediately after checking our coats in. The decor was beautiful with high ceilings, open kitchen concept with large comfortable seating.  We were approached by our server who introduced himself and asked if we had ever been to the restaurant (we hadn't) and he gave us a brief overview of what they specialized in and recommendations on the menu. I am telling you, this guy was great. He was knowledgable about each menu item and very helpful with the beverage pairing. I really enjoyed the little things they did like have all personal utensils in a little box before placing each individual utensil in front of you.  I got a sake flight with 3 different sakes to go with each of our appetizers. We started with the tuna tartare, grilled octopus and aburi sashimi selection (they're know for aburi). Everything was done well and balanced.  Grilled octopus was cooked perfectly, not chewy but soft with a bounce, the potato served with the octopus was white and I thought it would be bland just off of how it looked but this was the best potato I've ever had. The outside was slightly salted and the inside was buttery smooth but still crumbled. Yellowfin tuna was my favourite in the sashimi selection, followed by the scallop. Nothing was over cooked by the blowtorch and the plating was beautiful.  Next we had half a dozen raw oysters 2 of each kinds they had. The 3 house sauces were all great. Slightly disappointed when there was a noticeable piece of shell still attached to the top abductor muscle and I had to take it off with my chopsticks. That was an huge oversight by the chef responsible for shucking and that should not happen. Also 1 or 2 of the oysters had no juices in them so maybe they were accidentally spilled or the oyster was older.  Last round we got a half order of the red wave roll and full order of the spider roll (can't half the spider). Spider roll was amazing and wasn't over breaded and oily but the red wave roll stole the show. Inside the red wave was crab meat and avocado. Outside had tuna and pickled tobiko. I took one bite and died. It was buttery smooth and creamy and the tobiko jumps out at you at the end. Absolutely delicious. None of the sushi needed any soy sauce or anything extra because they were stunning on their own.  Finished off dessert with the panna cotta and oban 14 single scotch. Panna cotta wasn't overly sweat, very soft and creamy but light.  The meal took about an hour and a half and came up to $220 post tax and tip for 2 people. Through out the night, our server would check up on every dish and made sure everything was perfect and we were having a good time. Very charismatic guy and deserved the tip.  The place blew me away and anyone willing to drop the money should give it a go."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a couple of friends on a business dinner. The staff was beyond wonderful, just looking at the food would make your mouth water and eating it would take you to heaven. I highly recommend splurging on desert and drinks while you are here as well. I got the Apple Sticky Toffee pudding and still to this day, I have not had anything like it before. The drinks are a whole other level. Ask your waitress to recommend a wine or cocktail and you will not be disappointed. In terms of food, the biggest hit at our table was the calamari, I would highly suggest getting this dish!"}
{"text":"Great aburi sushi and fresh sashimi! Hands down one of the top in town!  However we also ordered pork belly. It was rather disappointing.  Friendly server but they cannot remember the orders and couldn't tell what fish it was. Hope they could train their servers better, still looking forward to go back next time!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and the food quality is always excellent. I would call and try to make a reservation before going. It's usually busy. The environment is very nice and they have a few TVs if you wanna watch the game and eat sushi.  Portion's are not huge and it can be quite expensive but the quality is excellent."}
{"text":"Miku is what sushi fantasies are made of. I came for lunch having heard several friends rave about the natively Vancouverite restaurant a few weeks ago. I have to start with service, because it was stupendous. Throughout the lunch I believe we interacted with three different waiters, but their behind-the-scenes coordination made for a seamless experience - from the succinct yet instructive overview of the menu (otherwise I would still find terms like oshi and aburi indecipherable...) to replacing our plates post-appetizer (though I had barely touched mine), to taking care to frequently check in on us without being overbearing, the servers impressed.   Now, the food - it is truly something. I ordered the Aburi ($23/8 pieces) which I highly recommend as torched sushi is what Miku does best, and upon your first bite it shows. I tried nigiri and oshi for the first time here, and suffice it to say that I'm now a believer. Miku is inventive, creating flavour profiles that challenge your palate in subtle but thrilling ways. The rice is sticky, soft and falls apart in your mouth. The fish is light, airy. The salmon oshi is a highlight, but everything was great. Even though I didn't love everything (some of the oshi had a citrusy undertone about which I wasn't particularly keen), I still appreciated how Miku went outside of the box in order to depart from more traditional sushi. My colleague praised the calamari as well. Not to mention the presentation of everything was lovely, and the interior decor is stunning. I can't wait to come again, which I hope will happen soon! :)"}
{"text":"Not sure what to say about this place aside from what's been said by everyone else already. Outstanding dining experience here from decor, service, and of course, the food! Had the Miku Waterfront Platter, the Miku roll, and a few a la carte nigiri sushi. Everything was fresh and tastey. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me on our anniversary and brought me to Miku. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by the hostesses who accommodated us being late for our reservation and coat-checked our coats. As we proceeded to our table and walked by the kitchen, the staff greeted us in traditional Japanese style. I immediately felt welcomed!  The restaurant has a beautiful, modern interior. All the staff we interacted with were very friendly and helpful. The menu was unlike anything I've seen and I let my boyfriend order for us as he's eaten at Miku before. My favourite was definitely the Aburi sushi! We tried the salmon, mackerel, and ebi which were all great! Aburi is the signature style of preparation at Miku that uses a blow torch. I could really taste the char on the Aburi sushi. I have quite the sweet tooth and the matcha molten lava cake was unreal! It is a MUST eat!  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience at Miku and would highly recommend to anyone that loves Japanese food!"}
{"text":"This place is more than just a Sushi restaurant, it is a live art studio for Sushi. This is by far the best Sushi I have had in a very long time, The plates were beautiful, the Sushi was fine dining level. I very much enjoyed my experience at Miku, you can expect me to come back any chance I get."}
{"text":"The sushis were sooooo great. The rice was flavored. However the platte was not worth $66, I would rather have sashimi in other place"}
{"text":"As usual I have nothing but good things to say about this place!!!   10/10 for service, quality, taste, ambiance and cleanliness !    I am addicted to Sashimi/ Sushi. And this is my weekly go to. I suggest lunch is the best bang for your buck. The portions seem much larger during lunch, their dinner is more dainty and just a over charged price for mostly all the same stuff.   Our main things is always Botan ebi, Uni, and hotate sashimi.   We order the premium sushi plate to get a little taste of the oshi, aburi and sushi.   Miku roll definitly our favourite with the flame seared fish top and rolled in tobiko!   And for deep fried lovers definitly try the Ebi Fritters, with teriyaki and spicy mayo. Mmm mmm!   Miku Chopped salad is so delicious with the Tempè, avocado, and pears.    Overall it is a pricy habit yes but you will never be disappointed with this place! Every flavour is impeccably amazing."}
{"text":"Pressed sushi heaven! We had a great dinner at Miku. Great idea for a a special night out as this \"Japanese\" restaurant experience is certainly not cheap. All our dishes were excellent; their specialty is obviously the pressed sushi and it was absolutely delicious. It literally melts in your mouth. Highly recommend it. Great service too."}
{"text":"True a phenomenal meal of fresh ingrediants and true attention to quality and detail! Having gone for Winterlicious, I only got to sample the establishment. However, the sushi starter was amazing, featuring a selection of torched and fresh Sushi, both were extremely fresh and were flavorful with their different sauces. The entree of beef tenderloin and foie gras was coupled well with well roasted brussel sprouts and potatoes, all in a wonderful miso sauce. Dessert was definitely a highlight, as the green tea opera featured a cake with a wonderful set of different layers and flavours, with matcha ice cream; truly one of the main highlights of the meal. The service was great, as they took the time to address a food allergy concern, and left us assured that we were in good hands! Overall, a wonderful dining experience with an excellent selection of well thought out dishes!"}
{"text":"Been waiting for this place to open for so long, at last I get to try it. I really enjoy the Miku signature set  to try sample of everything. I loved the Saba pressed sushi most, even more than the salmon one. And the Miku roll was heavenly, the torched uni on top really heighten the flavours!  The best thing ever is probably the choice of doing half order so if you can sample a bit of everything first. Service were also attentive and good, can't wait to be back to try other things on the menu such as their sashimi. This place would be a nice place to celebrate anything for the atmosphere and seating."}
{"text":"Quite honestly, this restaurant is way overrated. Sushi was good, melted in my mouth, but the prime ribs were just not nice...  Not worth the money..."}
{"text":"Been here on 3 occasions and each time I still think it's worth the money, food is really nice quality, and great presentation, their aburi sushi is my favourite of the sushi. But their sushi platters and sashimi platters are really great too.  And their dessert green tea opera is also really great."}
{"text":"We found Miku while on vacation in Vancouver and were happy to hear about the location right here in Toronto. The service was polite, attentive and the right amount of \"rush\". Food was creative, delicious and right on par with the Vancouver location. Fresh and unique, we sampled the aburi torched sushi. We have had nothing like it, its a reason to come back!  Our only disappointment was the view in Toronto which is nothing to get excited about. Its the sidewalk. That's it. What could they do? Add some greenery around the windows? Provide some more visual interest inside to detract from all the concrete? We were spoiled by the waterfront views in Vancouver. Prices are also sky high so this is really a special occasion resto not a place on frequent rotation."}
{"text":"The food and presentation here is AMAZING. I cannot compliment their matcha cake enough. I have never tasted cake this amazing, it blew my minddd. The round thing they served their sushi in looks like a death star, even cooler.   This place is a bit hard to find because it is located inside a business Building, but its worthhhh ittt!!!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I went to this place a while ago before catching a raptors game.  We had some sake and seafood, of course.  I would say to order their specialty which is blowtorch ed sushi.  It was quite tasty but I bit too buttery. Could be too much  sesame oils or something.  Place looks nice inside albeit pretty non eventful going in being a condo.  We also ordered a seafood platter which I would pass.  Overall pretty good place to hit before or after heading to the acc."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Miku as I've heard this location isn't as good as the Vancouver one. We came here for our anniversary dinner, and enjoyed it so much that we came again when my sister came for a visit.   4/5 - Service The host was friendly and seated us right away. After a bit a slow start, the service picked up and our waiter was great. The waiter was knowledgeable and able to make recommendations and suggestions. He also make sure to check in on us after every course to see how we were enjoying the meal, as well as checked in periodically to make sure we had what we needed. The overall flow and course of the meal was well timed, so we didn't feel like we were waiting long between courses. Our water was kept topped up through out the meal, and our plates were cleared away fairly quickly.  5/5 - Food We ordered the Kaiseki Miku dinner. Which is a bit pricey at $98 per person, but worth it. It's great if you want to celebrate a special occasion. The Miku comes with 5 courses selected by the chef. What I enjoyed about this was that you get a try a variety of things from the menu, and not just strictly sushi.   All their courses are beautiful and look like works of art. First course was sashimi, that came with a variety of raw fish and a spot prawn. The spot prawn was my favourite delicious and sweet. I usually don't like prawns raw as i find the texture a bit wird, but this was delicious. 2nd course was the raw oysters, pickled vegetables, tuna tartar, and a scallop dish. This was served in a cool white round bowl that split into three. I loved it all especially the raw oysters, which was served with a vinaigrette that complemented the taste of the oyster nicely. The scallop was seared and cooked perfectly. 3rd course was the prime rib. The meat yummy, tender, and melted in your mouth. I loved the sauce that was served with it, buttery and delicious. This is one of the best prime ribs that I've ever tried. I also really enjoyed the vegetables and the medley of mushrooms that accompanied the meat. I found the vegetables a tad over salted, but when eaten with the prime rib it balanced out. The portion size of the meat is decent as well. The fourth course is a variety of their different types of sushi including their aburi oshi sushi. I enjoyed all the different types especially the one that had fresh crab in it. Apparently, all their sushi has fresh crab in it. Lastly for the fifth course dessert came with a trio of desserts including a mini version of their famous green tea opera, a tofu mousse, and green tea ice cream. I'm not the biggest fan of the green tea opera. It's an elegant looking multi layered dessert, but I find that taste a little too subtle for my palate. I did really enjoy the tofu mouse that comes with fresh fruit, I found that it was light, refreshing, and had a silky texture to it. By the end of the meal I was really full and satisfied. Sometimes, when I get these chef meals, I feel like I can eat more. not the case in this situation.  My husband was looking for Charashi, which they don't unfortunately serve at dinner. But the waiter did recommend getting a sashimi platter, with a side of rice. This was similar to the 1st course in the Miku with more portions of the sashimi. He also ordered the Coal Harbour Platter that comes with fresh oysters, a oyster shooter, mussels, prawns, scallop crudo, and ceviche. He enjoyed the variety and freshness of the platter.  Decor 5/5 The decor is a balance of contemporary and Asian decor. It's elegant and unique. They have very unique lights that are on long rods. They chairs are big and nice and comfy. I liked the koi fish that had on one of the walls. The place is pretty big and has lots of seating, including a pretty big patio area.   We've only ever made reservations coming here, and I'd recommend it as they can get fairly busy during the dinner rush hour.  I'd definitely be back to eat here again."}
{"text":"Miku Toronto has wonderful service and super friendly servers.   We ordered the fish and chips (literally seaweed-flavoured taro chips!), premium sushi, miku roll and miso sablefish.   Everything was so flavourful and melts in your mouth. The sushi is topped with their miku sauce, so there's no need for soy sauce.  We finished with the chocolate cake, mouth-watering as soon as the thick chocolate flows out after cutting it open.  Amazing experience, my new favourite sushi spot in toronto. Although the view isn't as great as the vancouver location, the interior decor is quite well done! :)"}
{"text":"In a seascape of sushi, restaurants need to differentiate themselves from the pack. The main appeal for trying this pace is the Aburi Sushi, a style where the sushi is flame seared to create unique flavours and textures. After trying a variety of their offerings, I can easily say this is one of the better sushi restaurants in Toronto. The use of authentic, high quality ingredients and the respect for their flavours shines here. True, the prices are not modest, but neither is the food. Everything here was excellent, and the only thing I can complain about is that the ambient music level is so loud that conversation was not easy. I had a sake tasting flight to accompany my meal - a wonderful option that allows you to have more than one sake and to mix and match different sake flavours with different sushi. The Albacore Tuna and Wakame Tartare was delicious - high quality tuna mixed with wakame, red onion and avocado for a marvelous flavour experience. The red wave roll was wonderful - crab and avocado wrapped in red tuna and topped with a sauce of onion, ginger, sesame oil, soy and vinegar - a symphony of flavours that melts in the mouth. The smoked soy grilled octopus and the aonori tempura calamari were favourites for the kids. Flavourful grilled octopus on a quinoa base, these tasty bits went fast. Likewise for the calamari. I was concerned that there was too much batter, but it was light and the flavour was a perfect accompaniment to the properly cooked squid. The miku roll was also popular. Salmon, crab and cucumber wrapped in a layer of tobiko for a unique crunch, it was unusual and fantastic. The Aburi sushi was fantastic. A hint of lime lifts the seared shrimp to new heights, while the thin slice of jalapeno brings zest to the stronger taste of seared salmon. I had to order more this was so good. The ebi nigiri was excellent - a full, plump, soft shrimp that literally melted in my mouth - mmmmmmmm, that was good! The unagi nigiri was also great. By searing the outside, the inside was still tender and not dry as in so many other restaurants. My favourite of the night was the O-Toro sashimi - the fatty tuna belly served au naturel. This is an acid test of quality, as you cannot hide behind sauces, other flavours or ingredients. Either the tuna is high quality or it isn't, and this was damn good! I almost didn't have to chew, the heat of my mouth melted the fat and the tuna dissolved with little effort. Easily good enough to order again. Awesome! Out on a limb is the albacore tuna and seared foie gras. The combination of the unctuous seared foie gras and the delicately poached tuna somehow works, and works wonderfully! I had an O-Toro nigiri sushi aburi style - flame seared on top. This brush with the flame caramelized some of the fat and gave the tuna even more depth of flavour and texture. The drizzle of truffle oil didn't hurt, either. I didn't want to like it so much, but I did, I really loved it. We also ordered the Aburi prime plate - the chef's selection of nigiri sushi where each piece has it's own sauce and flavour profile. A marvelous sensory experience, each piece was it's own story. Wow! A fabulous sushi experience, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came for Winterlicious 2017.  Their lunch service begins at 11:30, and we got in a bit early at 11:20 and they said they were still doing some pre-service prep to provide customers with the best experience. Which is fine: they're located inside the Waterpark Place so you won't have to wait out in the elements.  The interior is well-decorated and very spacious. Lots of different types of seating depending on your needs. You might be seated at some booths near the window, or up at the bar, or some high tables, in front of the sashimi station, in front of the kitchen, and so on.  Washrooms are also quite something to take in. Toothpicks are available as needed. It just makes a lot of sense to have this stuff in the washroom than at the counter up front.  During the ordering, our waiter asked us if it was our first time here and made recommendations based on it. In the end most of us took the recommendations, and it did not disappoint. I ended up ordering the Miku Zen, the signature aburi sushi, and the green tea opera.  When each item was served up, our waiter explained each and every item on the dishes. Mind you, our appetizers came with 4 different dishes and the entree came with 6 pieces of sushi. He was also able to answer some random questions about random things like who runs the social media accounts at miku since the restaurant had liked some pictures that we posted a few minutes prior.  Another thing that I liked was almost all of us ordered the same dishes, and each dish was consistent in quality and presentation. You can see that a lot of care was put into aesthetics.  I enjoyed all of the dishes. There was nothing for me to complain about, so it's definitely 5-stars for me."}
{"text":"This is a different and classy Japanese restaurant.  The quality of the food is high and the prices match. Several of the dishes have a modern twist to them - the use of blowtorches for example. High ceilings and hardwood/ceramic tables and chairs with no sound absorbing materials lead to a significant level of ambient noise.  Service is very attentive.  The wine list has a preponderance of Saki's with a good selection of Western wines included on it.  Overall the restaurant would appear to attract a younger and wealthy crowd.  Of particular note were the Aburi sashimi selection and the Miku signature sushi, interesting, well prepared and tasty. The Akami nigiri were good but small. The two rolls were of lower quality and less interesting. The brussels sprouts are an outlier, and probably one of the few green things on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm giving a low rating not because of the food which was nothing but amazing but because of the poor service. Unfortunately we yet see lack of standards of the service industry in our top restaurants in the city. I took a friend from NYC there showing her a good new restaurant in Toronto and was very disappointed & ashamed by the service provided. Hopefully this review will be a reminder to train their staff at a 5 star rating they'd like to be as a top restaurant"}
{"text":"I've always been wanting to try Japanese food but as a vegetarian you have limited options in this cuisine. I was amazed when I first visited Miku, with not only the variety of vegetarian options but the style of presentation and flavors.  I tried the Garden Select lunch, which came with few rolls of rice sushi, tofu, and seaweed based side  (see picture). When we asked for soy sauce, I liked that the waitress encouraged us to try the items as-is, since soy sauce is apparently 'not recommended' by the chef :) I tried most items as-is and did not need soy sauce except for rice-filled sushi which seemed little dry and lacking flavor.   Each item tasted unique and well complimenting the overall dish. I was not sure if the lunch would be enough, but it was just right. My colleagues tried 'Premium' lunch which came with 12 pieces of sushi and had only good things to tell.  I have already been their twice so far, but would like to see if they update their menu before my next visit."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends on Saturday for a nice dinner and get-together - been here once before and it was PACKED! Definitely a testament to how special this restaurant is in the area and the presence it has. I've always loved the atmosphere, exuding both modernity and elegance.  I ordered the Spicy Sesame Edamame, some Salmon/Tuna Oshi rolls, the Prime Rib and a bottle of Takatenjin for the group. Our waiter was kind enough to be patient with one of my friends who was inspecting each and every bottle (he's a lush like that), until we found the right one with the help of the manager - and . The Spicy Sesame Edamame was decent - just regular edamame with a sauce/paste on top and hint of lime in it. The Oshi rolls were fantastic - one of the highlights of the restaurant and their signature rolls. It even got my non-sushi eating friend to have a few.  Prime rib was great - delicious and perfectly cooked, but the steak itself had a bit too much fat on it. Would expect a better cut, but for how good it was, I'm not going to sin it.   As for the sake, I've had it before but it tasted even better with company. Would recommend it, or the Dassai 50 for starters. Just check the bottling date on any sake to make sure it's young (18 months or less) for optimal flavour."}
{"text":"Super fancy must-try melt-in-your-mouth sushi!!!!! If you've never had sushi that melts in your mouth like chocolate then you need to try this place!   Atmosphere: 5/5 Price: 3/5 Presentation: 5/5 Taste: 6/5 Portion: 3/5 Service: 5/5  Atmosphere: This place is relatively new. Had to venture through a commercial building to find the front doors to this place and boy are their doors huge! Once you enter the chefs all greet you and everything is very nicely decorated in white!   Price: Priced on the higher side this is not your everyday sushi joint. Best to save this spot for a really special occasion or celebration. I came here with two other girls and we ordered maybe 4 dishes and a dessert and three flights of soju but our bill was $300 so you can estimate about $100 per person.  Presentation: Everything was so nicely decorated and presented that seeing the food already made me drool! All the fine details in their presentation definitely made the tasting experience even better!   Taste: OMG I have never had sushi that melts in my mouth as if it were chocolate!!!!! I will be dreaming about their sushi for months from now! Soooo incredibly scrumptious!   Portion: Expect the portions to be small here...similar to tapa styled restaurants! This is definitely not a place to go to if you are expecting large portions.   Service: Excellent customer service. They are extremely knowledgable about their dishes and know every single ingredient. The waiter who was explaining the dishes to us did so in a way that made us feel very excited and happy about them!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch yesterday and I ordered the Premium Sushi Lunch and Green Tea Opera as dessert. The aburi nigiri,  oshi and sushi tasted awesome! The aburi oshi was especially excellent. The green tea opera was too sweet and I didn't like it especially when the sushi dish I ate previous had already had a strong flavour. The service was great and I would go there next time to try something else for dinner."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday, and I loved everything about it! We had reservations on a Thursday night at 630pm. Once we walked in, our jackets were taken and coat checked, and we were quickly seated. The ambiance great! Our waiter came quickly, was very friendly, and took his time to explain the menu to us as it was our first time there.   We started off with Aburi Beef Carpaccio, which was awesome! I loved the shoyu eggs, it was perfectly cooked. The baby green and pear complimented the beef very nicely (although a lot less greens would have been good). The beef carpaccio itself was amazing, it melted in my mouth and was packed with flavour!   We then had the Kaisan Soba, which was basically a seafood soba. You can choose to get it mild or spicy. I got it spicy, which I thought was a very nice kick, I didn't find it too spicy. I was surprised with the generous amount of seafood that came with the soba. There were clams, mussles, prawns, scallop and squid. The seafood were all huge, and super fresh. The soba had a very nice texture to it, definitely one of the best soba I've had. Keep in mind this isn't your traditional soba dish though, it seemed a bit more stir fried. Anyways, overall it was super yummy!  Miku is known for their Oshi Sushi (aka the blow torch pressed sushi), so I definitely had to try that. I had the salmon and mackerel. Both were amazing! The rice was very sweet and soft. And both the salmon and mackerel were torched perfectly. The salmon sushi came with a small jalapeno on top, which adds a bit of a kick to it. My husband really liked that touch, I personally took it off before eating the sushi.   We also ordered the Miku roll, which was to die for. This roll literally melts in your mouth. What I loved the most about it is that there was such a thin layer of rice around the roll, with each bit, I mostly just tasted the salmon and uni and tobiko, which was awesome!!! I would recommend that everyone must try this roll!!   Everything was plated beautifully. I thought the price actually quite reasonable for the quality and ambiance of the restaurant. I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious sushi - the aburi is a nice touch.  Very clean looking space"}
{"text":"Their Winterlicious 2017 menu is awesome and a must try. I went there with one of my friends. We ordered totally different dishes and share together, so I have a chance to try as many options as possible. The Signature sushi selection is very unique with 2 rolls and 4 aburi sushi on a plate. They are all very fresh and delicious. I'm really into the texture of their aburi suhi. A must try! Sashimi Salad is great as well. I really enjoy those fresh sea food paired with the different sauces, such as avocado, anchovy and etc.  My entree is the miso baked sablefish and lobster tail. The sable fish is amazing! The best sablefish I've ever had. It is very tender and just finely seasoned. And the whole dish looks like a piece of art, very beautiful. The taste of the black eggplant puree is kind of interesting, smoky I guess? The beef tenderloin and foie gras is also a great choice with a quite big portion and excellent foie gras.  I like their Winterlicious limited dessert Bread pudding. Very interesting layers(vanilla ice-cream, bread, and custard), definitely a delicacy!   The servers who work for Miku are all very knowledgeable and friendly. They are able to provide you with some good wine suggestions. Right, Miku have some premium Japanese sake FYI."}
{"text":"Went for Lunch. Had the Miku Zen and Aburi Ginjo sake Pros:  - Accessible through the PATH underground. aka good shitty winter weather spot  - Organized hosting and prompt seating  - Pleasant server  - table staff were orderly  - Feels upscale, but no dirty looks for my \"f**k it\" attire  - Great saki selection  - Saki was great. Smooth with a crisp sake flavour taste. Perfect chilled temperature.  - Perfect sized lunch and beverage menus  - Comfortable seating Cons:  - Miku Zen was underwhelming, still good, but was anticipating better ( one friend commented how the Vancouver location wow'ed him, and this location did not ). Looking forward in trying other dishes.  - Tables were too close together ( table adjacent was eavesdropping )  - Kitchen staff looked like someone died"}
{"text":"I came here over the summer and got too busy to write a review but as I was looking through the old photos that I took at this restaurant, I felt this overwhelming responsibility to share my thoughts/warnings with the Yelp community.  Your first warning is the three $$$ that this restaurant is tagged with - so be prepared for a meal that won't be cheap. The price point is understandable because it is reflective of the restaurant's classy interior and its location by Harbourfront. In fact, I would imagine this place to be where business partners meet to close large sum deals after a company-paid meal.   My second warning is the food, which wasn't very special. My boyfriend and I ordered quite a few things to get a more comprehensive taste of their menu and we gotta say, none of their sushi, aburi, teriyaki dishes, or appetizers were spectacular enough for me to go into detail about. Don't get me wrong, the food was \"good\", as it should be at that price point, but it just didn't live up to being \"amazing\" as I was hoping for. So as it should follow, I personally wouldn't come back to Miku for food.  HOWEVER, I would 110% come back for the dessert.  My third warning is that you can't come here without ordering the green tea opera. It was a green tea genoise paired with matcha butter cream, dark chocolate ganache, adzuki bean cream, a hazelnut wafer, and matcha ice cream and it was SO unique and absolutely, mouthwateringly delicious. Definitely one of the best tasting desserts I've ever had that wasn't too sweet and perfectly balanced by textures and flavours."}
{"text":"sashimi and sushi are fresh and tasty. Love the chocolate matcha fondant soooo much!!!"}
{"text":"The place looks fantastic! And the food looks and taste even more amazing! If you ever get a chance, order their green tea cake for dessert, it is to die for!"}
{"text":"the sushi is not authentic as nothing in Japan is actually made in this fashion. Miku hides behind an image of authenticity but in actuality it is just the same westerNized oriental food as a million other venues.  quality of the ingredients is quite good but 8 can't possibly justify $9 12 oz beers and 20 dollar softshell crab rolls."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience with the Miku in Vancouver so I couldn't wait to try the TO location.  Brought my sister here for her birthday.  The decor is open concept and modern with some larger cozy booths.  You see the entire kitchen when you walk in and what looks like an army of chefs making all that magical food.  Service was perfect, friendly, attentive, without being snobbish or too aloof as can sometimes be the case.  We ordered the non alcoholic grapefruit smash cocktail which was a delicious blend of grapefruit juice and basil and ginger that was not too sweet.  Grilled octopus and seaweed salad for apps.    Seaweed salad was absolutely delicious blend of greens, seaweed, crispy radishes, cured salmon, avocado, tomatoes, and a lovely dressing.    Grilled octopus was tender and served with a  crispy chicken skin crisp (think pork rind but in chicken form).  It was okay but the sauce IMHO was not a good complement to the octopus.  The Oishi Salmon was of course delicious.  The rice was a tad cooler and a wee bit firmer than the Vancouver version.  I think I prefer the Vancouver version but we were told the hard water here makes it more difficult to get the same texture.  Sablefish and Aburi prime 10 piece nigiri tasting menu for mains.  Sablefish was melt in your mouth buttery soft goodness as promised.  The charred eggplant purée was too charred tasting for my personal liking.  The crispy prawn dumpling was delicious.   Of the 10 pieces of nigiri there were 7 really delicious pieces that had the perfect blend of fish and complementary accompaniments  (geoduck, Wagyu beef, flounder, lobster, scallop or clam, salmon roe, and a wild salmon).  Finished with green tea opera because you have to, seriously.  Green tea matcha ice cream and this delicious genoise cake with crispy layers.  Oh my it is soooo good...  Would definitely recommend this place for special occasion as well as every day if you like quality fish and seafood with an aburi twist."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have tried the Shokai set menu, Miku set menu, and the Coal Harbour Platter.  My favourite dish is probably the 1st course of the Miku meal - everything was so fresh and well seasoned! The raw prawns just melted in my mouth, and the oysters were flavoured incredibly (didn't taste like salt water). Everything that followed was good (the sushi stood out the most), but we kept thinking of the seafood and had to order more before dessert came.   So, we ordered the large Coal Harbour Platter. Overall I don't think I'll order the platter again - maybe it's because I ate it in the middle of the 5 course meal, but I found some of the flavours confusing, and comparatively speaking, it's not even close to being their strongest dish. We did manage to finish the platter, despite the large portions of everything, and we moved on to dessert, which was excellent! I loved every item on the plate.   Their cocktails are delish. At $15, they are pricey for sure, but for me the drinks really rounded out the experience.  Overall, spacious and modern ambience, friendly service, and great food (that is well portioned). I would recommend giving this place a try, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Huge hype when it first opened! Large space so it can accommodate a large group for any special occasions. In terms of sushi - its good but not wow. In comparison - jabistro has much better sushi & sashimi in general. Price wise - be ready to make a decent dent in your wallet. Their dessert is the standout point & is a must get!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this spot for Winterlicious (lunch $33 & well worth it)   Apps ~ Miku Zen - 4 seasonal dishes and miso soup. Such a filling app. The beef short rib was very tender and delicious  Main ~ aburi sushi - great selection of sushi, no need for soy sauce, the infusion of flavour is enough.  Dessert ~ green tea opera - yummy matcha ice cream and wafer combo.  Overall great service, fast and efficient. It was also unique that the waiters would describe each dish upon serving it to you."}
{"text":"This is about \"Service\" ONLY!   Everything was fine in the beginning. We were in a good mood so we didn't expected our  server would be that rude to us. I think his name is AJ.  - He poured us some water and feel like he slammed the cup on the table.  - One of the server/assistant server spilled food on one of my friend's chair,  and the sauce stuck on her bag, and onto my other friend's clothes. This incident already proved that the service wasn't professional at all. That wasn't the only thing that made us upset and disappointed. - When one of the assistant server filled water for us,  he yelled at her and said \"you're giving water to the wrong table\" in front of my face. I know maybe the table behind needed some water urgently, but that doesn't mean we didnt need water at all!!!! - In the end my friend was just trying to tell him to be aware of his staff and not to spill food onto other customers again, but he then responded to her rudely.  Two stars for the foods.  But definitely I'm not coming back just because of the service. Would not recommend friends to come here.  Thank you for your caring!"}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi in Toronto.  Exceptional food and exceptional service. Thank you to Stella."}
{"text":"Best Japanese restaurant in town. A must try if you are in Toronto.  No soy sauce needed on anything!!!!"}
{"text":"Its a seafood/ japanese restaurant. The mussel is amazing however the sushi needs someimprovement especially the rice. The rice is too soft, not up to standard. Excellent service but overpriced. Given that the restaurant is located downtown, i guess it does make sense that price is higher."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, and the food here has not disappointed. Everything is very well executed. Great ambiance, attentive service.  We ordered a number of dishes to share:  Appetizer/snack: Albacore tuna and wakame tartare Smoked soy grilled octopus Pan seared scallops Spicy sesame edamame All of the above were very delicious. Each plate has so many different sauces and sides, with a variety of flavours  Entree: Kyoto saikyo miso baked sablefish Kaisen soba peproncino - I wasn't sure what to expect from the description of this dish, but it was very very good. Soba with a sauce and lots of seafood. It was nicely seasoned and the soba was so flavourful. This was like a fusion of japanese/chinese/italian.  Sushi: Salmon oshi sushi Ebi oshi sushi (prawn) Saba oshi sushi (mackerel) Yum, torched sushi. The mackerel one was my least fav. The prawn one tastes fresh as it has lemon flavour. Salmon one has some salmon inside the rice in addition to on top.  Rolls: Red wave roll Soft shell crab fritter roll Miku roll The standout out of these three was the Miku roll. Torched roll with fish eggs giving the outside a crunchy texture. The soft shell crab roll was delicious as well - has the crunch and also comes with two pieces of soft shell crab in addition to the roll. The red wave roll was our least fav as it did not stand out in terms of flavour and I felt it had too much rice.  Dessert: Green tea opera Warm valrhona matcha chocolate fondant Ichigo mochi dome Passonfruit mousse and sake frozen yogurt The standout FOR SURE was the chocolate fondant. So so so good. The matcha chocolate inside. The jasmine tea ice cream. The rice crisps. Everything about that plate is perfection.  The green tea opera was quite dense, and tasted of hazelnut chocolate and matcha.  The mochi dome I wasn't a huge fan of as it tasted like jam/jelly on mochi. The passionfruit mousse was ok. Not too memorable.  I tried a sip of the aburi(?) cocktail and it was a bit sweet for my liking.  Overall Miku is great for a lovely night out."}
{"text":"Friend took me out to a birthday dinner here, I missed an opportunity to try Miku in Vancouver so when I had the choice of my bday pick, I chose Miku!  Miku is located in a financial (I think?) building, with an underground parking available right next to it (score !don't gotta prowl for downtown parking ) at $4 each half hour.  Upon arriving, the entrance of the restaurant consists of two huge wooden doors, made me second guess whether that was the entrance or side door for employees as there wasn't any sign or anything inviting.  Hostesses were super friendly and nice upon walking in, with coat checking services.   The Interior had a generous seating arrangement with a modern sleek ambience, and soft lighting but not dim enough to strain your eyes (if you're near sighted like me)   Our server, Morgan, who mentioned he opened up both Vancouver and Toronto's location had extensive knowledge in the dishes that were popular, which dishes made Miku well known, the ingredients in each dish and even which cocktails to which taste buds. He even suggested we ordered from light to heavy (ordering left to right on the menu). He was superb! His service was very polite, friendly and attentive. We even had a chat about his new puppy, don't even know how that came up though but goes to show how easy to talk to he was!   For the food:  It is a MUST to order the appetizer \"Aburi Sashimi Selection\" - this dish blew me away!  It's 8 pieces of sashimi with pairing signature sauces - $25  The rest of the dishes were indeed delicious but didn't wow me, my friend on the other hand enjoyed everything.  The other dishes ordered were:   -Coal Harbour Platter - regular size  -Kaisen Soba pepperoncino : Basically spiced soba noodles stirfried-like with yellow peppers, 1 prawn, 1 scallop, clams, mussels, squid and octopus  -Ebi Oishi Sushi  -Miku Roll   Ending it off with salted caramel ice cream and jasmine ice cream.  Minus 1 star because my personal preference of the sushi rolls were good......but not amazing bomb wowow ting like.  Overall, lovely interior, amazing service and staff, delicious food and I would recommend this place to try just even for the experience."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday surprise ... my birthday surprise lol. Walked into the restaurant to see one of my buddys go \"oh-shit\" LOL..  We were in the private room and when everyone arrived and was settled down the server came by to explain the basis of the menu. After looking thru the menu and haven our drink orders taken we waited for the server to come back annnnd waited and waited. I'm sure it wasn't her fault as we had a big group and she wanted everyone to have a check to go thru the entire menu but I was kinda in a rush because I had to be somewhere (and the rest of the group) promptly after dinner. The food arrived shortly after and everything was not short of an amazing! I got the premium sushi sampler which showcased a piece of their \"best selection\" , the miso sablefish, and o-toro sashimi (mahhhh favvvvv). I can say that I did enjoy everything but at the same time I felt like there could've been slightly more to it, can't specially say what it was but something felt missing :(.   The service thru out dinner service was good our waters were always filled and we were checked up on a few occasions but not too often where it seemed pushy only negative I could say with the service was the long wait for our food order to be taken.   I always justify the price of something for the quality and value. As I mentioned earlier \"something felt missing\"with that being; it was a little pricey for what I got. I will return though because there are other items on the menu I really wanted to try but there was no way I was going to eat that much food and then go out and drink heavily.   Service 3.5/5 Food 4/5 Price(Value) 3.5/5  Overall 3.5 very close 4."}
{"text":"I've been to the original Miku location in Vancouver before but I have to say the toronto location had better quality and taste to their items! Came in for my mom's birthday and was excited to show her what this Miku craze was all about.  We were greeted very friendly by our server a d she was prompt in explaining the menu over to us. To start, we had the coal harbour platter which came with an assortment of oysters, mussels, tiger shrimp, scallop sashimi, ceviche and a marinated Atlantic Salmon sashimi. This platter was nicely presented and also came with 3 different sauces to try. The chimichurri one was my all time fav. Infused with wasabi and had the right amount of citrus to the taste.  Next we had their premium sushi lunch which came with their speciality aburi sushi and nigiri sushi. All were nicely presented and tasted amazing! The sashimi platter was also great. Came with about 15 pieces of different fish/seafood sashimi. Also had this little kale peanut salad and some pickled vegetables. Was a nice kick after eating the sashimi pieces. The sashimi pieces were sliced perfectly, not too big nor too small, and was smooth and fresh tasting. Lastly can't go to Miku without having their Miku roll! Uni, salmon, crab and unagi all in one.. what more can you ask for?! Torched too perfection. My mom and I thought that was the best one we had by far.  Overall we were so stuffed! But can't celebrate my mom's birthday without having Mikus opera cake. It was a delicious 7 layer cake with matcha icecream. Miku was so kind to even write happy birthday with a candle on the plate for my mom.  Great experience and lunch Prices are very fair. Definitely recommend if you're in the area at lunch time!"}
{"text":"To enter Miku Toronto, you have to walk through the doors inside the lobby of the RBC Waterpark Place.  Miku doesn't have their own entrance outside of this building.  It took me some figuring out to find the rotating doors on Bay Street that were unlocked in order to get inside to the restaurant.  We were first served with an amuse bouche of oyster croquettes.  This bite-sized croquette was indeed really good and I was delighted to start the meal with an amuse bouche.   To my surprise, our platters of sushi arrived very quickly -- quicker than the average high-end sushi joint.  We weren't complaining though since we got to enjoy our aburi right away.  I savoured my Premium Nigiri selection first.  There were seven pieces of really well crafted nigiri pieces where the fish was very fresh, soft, and tender paired with rice that was equally soft and fine.  We had a selection of two types of soy sauce (one sweet regular one and another one that I believe was exclusive to Miku).  I especially liked how the nigiri pieces were very substantial and sizable.  I really enjoyed each piece and loved how fresh the seafood was.  The crafting of the nigiri was excellent.   My favourites in this selection would have had to be the salmon and ebi nigiri.  The Aburi Oshi Plate had two pieces each of Salmon Oshi, Saba Oshi, and Ebi Oshi.  The Ebi Oshi Sushi was pressed prawn with lime zest and ume sauce.  This was a really light tasting Ebi Oshi but the prawn was firm and the entire sushi tasted very creamy and saucy.  The Saba Osih Sushi was pressed house-cured mackerel with miso sauce.   The Salmon Oshi Sushi was my favourite one out of the three.  This was pressed British Columbia wild sockeye salmon with jalapeño and Miku sauce.  Mmm, I love wild sockeye salmon and this was so delicious!  The slight heat of the jalapeño was perfect and there was a very subtle crunch from it as well.  For dessert, T ordered the Green Tea Opera (of which I took a bite to try).  Again, it arrived very quickly after ordering and it was absolutely a piece of art work -- food art!  The food runner who brought it to us informed us that this Green Tea Opera cake took three days to make and that there were seven layers to it in total.  The Green Tea Opera consisted of green tea génoise, matcha butter cream, dark chocolate ganache, adzuki bean cream, hazelnut wafer, and matcha ice cream.  It was so well put together -- the high standing sugar decoration to the colourful fruits to the swirl of the rice cracker around the perfectly scooped matcha ice cream.  It was incredibly delicious, crunchy yet smooth, and very flavourful.  The matcha ice cream was very milky too.  If you are a matcha dessert fan and willing to splurge, this is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Miku exceeded my expectations with their gorgeous venue, amazing service, and delicious food. Possibly one of the few five star reviews I will ever give.   Located near Waterfront at the first level of a building, the restaurant isn't entirely too difficult to find. Very spacious venue with modern lighting and decor. Walking into the restaurant, I was already very impressed with how sophisticated it looked and had high hopes for my experience here.  The service at Miku blew my mind. Our waiter was so polite and knew the menu from top to bottom. He was able to explain literally every ingredient of every dish and how it was prepared. Obviously knew his stuff very well.  As for food, we ordered every one of our waiter's recommendations and loved every dish! Note that we visited Miku on New Year's Eve for dinner but selected the condensed menu rather than the NYE menu. Had the octopus for appetizer, the sablefish for entrée, the red wave roll (their specialty rolls), and the Green Tea Opera (their signature) for dessert.   Although the food portions were smaller than I had imagined (and for its hefty price), I will definitely be coming again and recommending this place to friends and family. A great restaurant for fancier occasions in my opinion, but definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"The service was phenomenal.  The only issue we encountered was we came here for my brother's birthday and I had called for reservations and informed them to ensure a happy birthday message written on his dessert plate.  They even confirmed that during their callback the day prior to confirm our reservations.  It turned out that there was lack of miscommunication and that birthday message didn't get carried out to our server.  It was so disappointing because my brother's surprised happy face was supposed to be my highlight that night.  However, it was very well handled and resolved by their manager with many sincere apologies, all the desserts we ordered were on the house (was over $60).  So we were very pleased with how they dealt with the matter.   Now onto the good stuff.  The food was PHENOMENAL and the best Japanese cuisine I've had in Toronto.   1) Nigiri prime - the freshest of their fresh saved for this sashimi   2) seared scallops - fresh and cooked to perfection with raw centers  3) kaisen soba peperoncino - shrimps were very large in size and soba noodles chewy good  4) Miku roll - bit on the fishy side for me but family throughly enjoyed it   5) ebi, salmon, saba aburis - fantastic was very good we ordered total of 4 orders each   6) soft shell crab fritter roll - larger in size good flavour and crab was fresh  7) calamari - deep fried yet quite tender and paired well with the squid ink and good presentation   8) uni - best ever tasted according to my family   9) desserts were more on the average side"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate an anniversary. The service is very accommodating and friendly, but the highlight is truly the food. We ordered a Shokai course meal as well as the Beef Carpaccio and the Aburi Oshi Sampler. Every bite was delightful; there is a sense that there is careful attention to different elements of taste. Highly recommended for any occasion."}
{"text":"Best sushi spot in Toronto.  Great service and location. Staff always welcomes you with great suggestions on their favourites and explanations on the freshest items on the menus.  Their cakes are a must"}
{"text":"I LOVE MIKU!!! My favourite place for sushi. Environment is nice, staff are friendly, food is absolutely amazing. Their torched sushi and sashimi just melts in your mouth. Although it can be pricy I think that it's worth every penny"}
{"text":"Love love love!!! Great food and the service was great. Came here for my birthday and we all had a blast!! The food was well prepared and fresh. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and so glad I did!   My friend and I tried the Salmon Oshi Sushi, which literally melts in your mouth. This is by far my favourite sushi roll ever and I HIGHLY recommend it. We also tried the soft shell crab roll (forgot its name) which came with 2 small pieces of crab on the plate. This roll was pretty average and it was more deep fried flour than the crab itself.   We also got some (expensive, not worth the price) salmon and tuna belly (toro) sashimi. It comes in 6 pieces, but you can ask to get a half order and get 3 pieces instead. As we were waiting for the sashimi, we were salivating at the thought of the toro but were soon quickly disappointed. Both the sashimi tasted like... nothing. Honestly, AYCE sashimi would've probably tasted better.   For dessert, we shared the chocolate lava cake dessert and it is delicious! The chocolate cake is warm and moist and decadent. It comes with a scoop of jasmine tea ice cream and a bunch of fruits.   Even though I wasn't impressed with the soft crab shell roll and sashimi, I would definitely come back to Miku for that torched salmon sushi and dessert."}
{"text":"This chic upscale Japanese restaurant is known for its innovative menu. Its #aburi sushi (flame seared) is delicious.   I came here for lunch on several occasions and enjoyed the Miku Zen which us Miku's version of the bento box. This high end lunch set is a meditation of amazing flavours. Miku Zen comes with miso soup, four season items (choosen by the chef) and 5 pieces of aburi sushi ($29). I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Sushi has become my new pizza. I crave it allllll day long. I could eat it every single day. Last night after a quick drink at Ki, my friend and I decided to head over to Miku for dinner - we'd heard amazing things about it and any excuse to try a new sushi place. I was surprised on a Thursday it wasn't busier, however our server indicated Monday and Tuesday are their busy nights but we were promptly seated and everything came out so quickly, I'm not going to complain about the lack of noise around me.   Although not for me, they offer sake flights here which I think is really cool but our server made a sake recommendation to me (unfortunately I can't recall what it was) and I loved it.  In terms of food, we had the salmon Oshi sushi (the pressed sushi, they're known for) which was really tasty, the red wave roll, good but I'd probably pass on in the future and try something else and the Miku roll that I couldn't get enough of. All their sauces are incorporated inside which took me a while to notice but everything had really nice flavor.   My biggest fear with new sushi places is that they always start out blowing my mind ie Kasa Moto and then as time goes on everything just goes down to subpar. I really hope Miku sticks to what they have going because I'd return again....and again...and again....and again. :)"}
{"text":"Sushi that melts in your mouth! I went here with a couple of girlfriends to celebrate a birthday. This was the first time that soya sauce was not needed. The sushi is flavourful and melts in your mouth.   A bit pricey."}
{"text":"Apart from it's high price (which is fully justified by the food quality), this is my go-to place for quality sushi and sashimi. It has the best Hokkaido scallop sashimi that I have ever had in Toronto. Though I can only afford the 8 pc sushi platter, it is still good enough for me!"}
{"text":"The fish was excellent- the first consideration in any sushi restaurant. The octopus appetizer had perfectly cooked, tender octopus with a tasty sauce. Excellent nigiri- Hotate, Maguro, yellowtail- thought the fish pieces were on the small side. Desserts were beautiful and delicious- the molten cake was the most molten I've ever seen , with a perfect balance of chocolate and matcha, and plated with an assortment of accompaniments that added varied textures and flavors. The opera cake was good, though not as exciting.  Not only was the food great, but the staff was attentive and friendly, the room attractive. The place is hard to find- in an office building and not really marked from the outside- but one of the revolving doors on Bay got us in- and a good thing, so we didn't miss out on a great dinner."}
{"text":"Holy crap, this place is AMAZING! Everything about Miku is amazing, from the place itself, to the service, the food and even the washrooms is awesome! My bf and I came here to celebrate our anniversary on an early Sunday evening. It's located in the RBC building so you won't see the Miku sign out front. As soon as we entered, I noticed how big Miku was. The hostess was nice enough to offer coat check so of course I said yes. We were seated by the window, and we were seated far enough from the other tables so that we were able to get privacy.  We had a lovely server who gave us her recommendations, but eventually we came down to ordering the Aburi Sashimi Selection - $27, Aburi Oshi Plate - $17, Miku Signature Selection - $36, Red Wave Roll - $18. As for drinks, I had the 1893 (?) cocktail, but it was delicious and taste like juice so I highly recommend that one.  Every order that came to our table, it was presented very nicely. The servers who brought our food out would always explain what was on the plate and what kind of sauce accompanied it. I thought the sashimi tasted very fresh and not fishy at all. I think my favourite dish would be the Miku Signature Selection because you're able to taste a variety of aburi, rolls and nigiri. I also enjoyed the Aburi Oshi Plate and quickly deemed that the ebi oshi was our favourite out of the three aburi sushi. We loved the ebi oshi so much we had to order the Ebi oshi sushi - $17 by itself. There's a slight lime taste to it and it actually pairs quite well with the ebi. Although one might find it oily, but I'm not picky with my food so I didn't mind. Our last order was the Cho toro nigiri at $8 a piece, loved it! No complaints.  Lastly, we ordered dessert - the famous Green Tea Opera - $13.50. The cake itself had different layers and all layers had a different kind of texture and taste. Definitely recommend!  If you're feeling spendy spendy or want to celebrate a special occasion, definitely try Miku! I would say it's better than JaBistro and I love JaBistro! I even heard the owner visited Miku...so I wonder what he thinks lol. Once again, I strongly recommend this place. Will visit again...but not so soon (it's pricey)!"}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-5 Service-5 Food-3 Strikeouts-1/3  I went to miku for their special aburi sushi with an open mind, and I was disappointed. This the strike out. Went in for their specialty, went out thinking... Darn, Japango did the torched so much better.  Honestly, the aburi was either to saucy and lacked any eminence of fish taste. I want to be able to taste the salmon, tuna, or whatever. It lacked either in depth or/and thickness. I ordered the aburi prime along with a kaiseki. This is basically omakase, and I feel the chef failed me.   Now what I can say that's good. I went with 6 people, so I saw a good variety of dishes. Before that, the Ambiance was amazing. Sweet dinner date restaurant. Well lit and good service. Service is definitely top quality. The servers even noted an option for those that had a raw shrimp that they could deep fry the head so it can be eaten as a soft shell crab. All the dishes that weren't sushi was good! Go figure, they hired a good Chef inside. Sablefish was done right! Very smooth and tender, slides right off with ample flavour. The prime rib steak is huge and done to perfection as instructed. Muscles and oysters are to die for! Muscles with bacon and Brussels sprouts!?! Like what?  All around good kitchen!   I also love their dessert, though this restaurant does make everything more modernized, it still tastes amazing. The \"goo\" that comes out of that matcha chocolate cake.... Enjoy!!  So will I come here for sushi again? Probably not, but the entrées are good. With  the price, probably go to canoe instead."}
{"text":"Friendly service and great food! The restaurant is gorgeous and in a nice area as well. Seafood is fresh and I'm always left wanting more after each plate. It's definitely pricier but I'd put it along the same category as Ja Bistro. You're definitely paying for the quality here. No complaints, gotta try this place out."}
{"text":"I have been to lots of restaurants but I never seen such slow service. We ordered 5 dishes and it took us 2.5 hours to finish. The food is really extraordinary though, the seafood is super fresh. But still I cannot take it since it is almost 11pm and they still want to rebake the dessert. Again it is way too slow, if you want to kill time and not too hungry, maybe yes."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious and it did not disappoint!  As we walked in, they took our bags and coats which was nice. The place was big and contemporary. For the winterlicious lunch, we had:  Miku Zen: A set of 4 appetizers that included a simple salad with tofu, beef skewers with golden potatoes, fried shrimp with Mayo and albacore tuna. The portions were more generous than I thought and flavours were balanced and really stood out. 4.5/5  Sashimi Appetizer: A sashimi salad that included salmon, red tuna and hamachi. Bf had this and portions were generous as well! 5/5  Signature aburi: Every single piece was soooo good and creamy, the only piece that was so-so for me had a bit of asparagus in it that I didn't really like, but all in all it was outstanding. 4.5/5  For dessert, we had the green tea opera cake which was AMAZING! It was really tiny tho, but quite rich and I felt very satisfied after. 5/5  Overall, we really enjoyed our meal and would come back for the regular menu items."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Miku. The first time was for dinner. Today I went for lunch and ordered the Aburi sashimi selection $23, it was six pieces with their signature sauce and their aburi Oshi sushi (salmon, Saba and Ebi, all rectangular shaped)   From the plating, to the sauce, to the quality of the fish and freshness. It was beautifully done. I must point out their sauce always goes well with the sashimi. I took a few of my friends along today and they all enjoyed it.   Will be back again!"}
{"text":"As far as Japanese restaurants goes in Toronto, this is it! Why did they take so long to open here, and why did I wait so long to try? Nonetheless, now that I've found Miku, I'm about to indulge like never before.   From the moment we entered the restaurant we knew this place had it. Had the right attentive and knowledgeable service, had the right atmosphere, the right selection of food, and more importantly the right cooking/food.   If I were to balance this review with a criticism, it would be the location. Since I hate taking public transit (namely the TTC) and walking more than a block to my meals, I find the location painful for the driving crowd (especially more so when the weather is better and the traffic is worse by the lake). Since I have been blown away by my overall enjoyment, I shall try to overcome this and \"suck it up\" and also tolerate the fact they don't have validated parking where the cost rivals that of parking at the Pearson."}
{"text":"They have good Otoro    did omakase   It was excellent.   Japanese sea urchin  was top notch.  Get the Japanese over the Boston one   You have to enter through the office building this was an it confusing.    Service was good. Nothing to rave about.  Will return for omakase"}
{"text":"Had lunch at this new sushi place yesterday and was somewhat underwhelmed.   Miku is enormous. The decor is clean and modern, very tastefully decorated but felt a bit cold due to its size. It's hard to imagine a place this large being sustainable. Service was terrific. Everyone is polite, attentive and well informed about the menu.  The sushi - Miku has interesting takes on oshi-zushi, aburi-zushi adding their own unique toppings and sauces (no need for soy sauce or extra wasabi). They stray from the traditional in that regard but for some reason did not 'wow' me. Yasu, for me is the standard bearer though they are more traditional.   Miku is good but I struggle to recommend going out of your way eat there."}
{"text":"Best aburi in town! It's pricey but so worth it! I guess it's similar to jabistros aburi but the garnish and everything else is melt in your mouth delish"}
{"text":"If I didn't try Vancouver's Miku before my experience in Toronto's I'd give it a 4 star. Food was good, but just not as good as Vancouver's. We ordered the same dishes in different cities and the food was made differently. In Toronto, the beef carpaccio was served with a soft boiled egg- in Vancouver they put the raw yolk in the center. A minor difference but wow did it make such a difference to the texture and taste. Rolls were good- but I prefer Ja'Bistros. Environment: 10/10 Service: 9/10 Food: 7.5/10"}
{"text":"My first and favorite meal in Toronto. I love sushi. Miku is known for aburi sushi, where the topside is partially grilled. I ordered the aburi sashimi selection. Everything was so good, but my favorite was the ebi. I would've been happy eating here every day during my trip if it wasn't so pricy. I know that Miku has a location in Vancouver, so now I have another reason why I need to go to Vancouver."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a premium sushi restaurant, look no further.  Here, you'll spot the elusive business people popping in for a quick dinner, after work nom, or a business meeting.   This place is truly modern and luxe. Appearances do delight, but let's move on to the food!  My partner and I came here especially for the torched sushi. We had the salmon oshi and saba oshi. Amazing torched flavour. It wasn't overpowering with the sauces. We barely touched our soy sauce throughout the meal. It was such a delight.   We had the tuna sashimi to start, though. You always need sashimi to tell the freshness of the fish. And I can honestly say that this was the freshest sashimi I've ever tasted. It tasted clean. No hints of \"fishyness\" that I've come to abhor at sushi places. Great mouth feel as well.   We had the calamari as well, for an appetizer. The presentation was beautiful. No chewyness to the calamari. The flavours were so good on its own. Lightly salted but you can still taste the calamari.  The Miku roll was very flavourful and very filling. The tobiko really made it all so scrumptious.   I really appreciated the good service. Our server asked if we had any allergies and accommodated us. Really amazing.   The drinks were a delight as well! The Miyazaki #2 was gorgeous! And delicious as well. Very cool gastronomy."}
{"text":"I've been high anticipating the day of my Miku visit and it has finally arrived!  We ordered the Miku roll, Miku zen (4 salads and 5 pieces of sushi), and the Aburi lunch set. By far my favourite item would have to be the aburi salmon and tuna. The fish was still extremely tender despite being torched, and completely melts in your mouth. For the aburi salmon, I loved the surprising hints of flavour in each - the kick from the jalepeno in the aburi salmon and the zest of the lime in the tuna was absolutely fantastic. I would have preferred more fish on each piece though.  The 4 salads in the Miku zen were just so-so. I felt that it wasn't value for money, especially when coupled with a mere 5 pieces of sushi came up to $29. As for the Miku roll, I did enjoy how the generous amount of salmon roe provided the salty flavour and texture. However, I was expecting something more unique for a namesake roll.   All in all, I would come back here on special occasions and load up on aburi sushi!"}
{"text":"Got the five course Miku tasting menu. I really didn't know what I was eating half the time -- scratch that, looking back at the photos I took, probably like all the time.   They did describe everything... but I couldn't really keep up. Needless to say this place was a bit fancy and everything tasted great. Big recommend the aburi sushi though. Literally melts in your mouth!  Funny moment when the steak arrived, they didn't provide us with knives and forks immediately. I was left to wonder if we were supposed to jab at the meat with chopsticks. But they were just bringing them as a separate set; silly me.  Oh, the orders also came with a wine pairing which was very memorable."}
{"text":"Under whelming experience. The restaurant is beautiful, food is just ok. I truly wanted to like it but it just like eating at a high-end chain restaurant. For the same price or less I would recommend Sushi Kaji, authentic japanese dinner that will blow you away which in this price range it truly should!"}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try out Miku in the Toronto location since I went to the one in Vancouver. After reading a few reviews after the Toronto location opened I decided to go for lunch since that was recommended by others.  Arrived at Miku around 2 p.m on a Saturday afternoon. There wasn't that people at that time. We were greeted by the hostess and chefs very politely and seated in no time. My boyfriend and I both ordered the premium lunch special($29) which comes with miso soup. We also ordered the tempura fish and chips($12) as an appetizer.  Our waiter was very friendly to us while serving us. He mentioned to us that he would bring our appetizer first. We were served the miso soup, it was delightful light miso taste. Soon after the tempura fish and chips which came with ponzu and house made tartar sauce. We both thought their ponzu was a bit too salty for our liking so we stuck with the tartar sauce. We were told that the day's featured fish was silver fish. The fish was nice light and flakey very well done. Just crispy enough even when dipped in either sauces they stay crispy and not soggy.  When the premium special came the waitress asked if we would like a break down of our food which was very informative. The premium special comes with six nigiri sushi and six aburai sushi. We both loved the mackerel aburai, the fish was so buttery and smooth. The nigiri sushi was pretty standard but with a more fresh clean taste than other places.   Overall we were pretty satisfied with what we ordered but pretty pricey as mentioned in other reviews it's not a place to go to more once a week. Maybe for a special occasion or just to try out."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious and left very happy with the food and service.   Food: 5/5 the Aburi sushi selection was delicious. The plate was very well put together and every piece offered a different and delicious taste to the palette.  The beef tenderloin and fois gras walere great but I wish I stuck with a seafood theme and would try the lobster next time.  The green tea opera is their signature dessert and it definitely didn't disappoint.  A lot of attention is put into the presentation as well. My server noticed that the cake on my friend's plate fell over to one side and offered to take it back to fix the plating, which my friend declined because it all goes down the same    Service: 5/5 the service was wonderful. The staff were very attentive and we had a lot of individuals, not just the server (including the manager) check in on our table. The staff were very knowledgable and every plate brought to our table was carefully explained. Everyone had a very pleasant smile on their face and positive attitude. It made for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I'll give this a 4.5.  I fell in love with the venue the minute I stepped into the restaurant. Spacious with high ceilings, modern decor and lighting. The place is gorgeous! Despite being a higher-end restaurant, Miku still exhibits the characteristics of a Japanese establishment as the chefs will still yell out a welcome or goodbye to you upon arrival and exit. As for service, our server was knowledgeable and friendly. Very polite and always nearby to assist us.   We came by for lunch on Valentine's Day. My boyfriend and I got the Premium Sushi each and a Miku Roll to share.  Premium Sushi ($29) - Comes with 2 salmon oshi, 2 saba oshi, 3 aburi, 3 nigiri and 2 pieces of the Red Wave roll. I'd highly recommend this as it gives you the opportunity to try a little bit of everything that they have to offer.   The pressed sushi is amazing here! I didn't get a chance to try the ebi but the salmon and saba blew me away. The salmon has a kick to it as it's topped with jalapenos but I removed it. The saba was a standout because I've never liked mackerel but I would order this again and again.   Another highlight of the platter was the Red Wave Roll. I never understood California Rolls until now. Oh, the difference real crab makes. It was delicious!! The Red Wave is a clean roll with only a hint of masatake sauce which allows you to taste the creaminess of the crab (a very generous amount is given) and the freshness of the tuna. This roll was so much better than I had expected. As for the aburi and nigiris, solid across the board (except for the shrimp, just average). They give quite a bit of rice and the fish is a thick cut so the platter as a whole is pretty filling. 4.5/5  Miku Roll ($22) - Good but doesn't quite measure up to JaBistro's roll. I couldn't really taste the uni so in turn, the roll wasn't as soft or creamy. I did however, liked the crunchy texture of the fish roe and the Miku sauce. Don't get me wrong, this roll is amazing but it just didn't have an explosion of flavors and that incredible melt-in-your-mouth feeling that I got from JaBistro. 4/5  To end the meal, we got the Warm Matcha Chocolate Fondant ($14). If you ever come to Miku, don't pass up on dessert as it's definitely one of the best things there! The ganache was a mixture of matcha, white chocolate and dark chocolate. Drools* Wasn't too sweet in any way and the Jasmine tea icecream was a great palate cleanser. All the components worked so well together, I was in heaven. 5/5  Memorable experience at Miku. I'd come back in a heartbeat. Loved the space and looking forward to trying their cooked foods."}
{"text":"After reading reviews of this place, I decided to try this place out with family. Miku Toronto is located in the RBC Waterpark Place office building. It is tucked inside, as they don't have their own entrance. Inside the decor is clean and simple with an upscale feel to it. I gotta admit, I should of booked the table by the sushi bar. Back to the decor and environment... Once you get inside, you will see a collection of their sake and other chilled wine. Very upscale indeed.   So once I was seated at my table, the server assigned to my table came to say hello and asked what beverage will I want. At the same time I flipped thru the menu. My eyes were locked onto the flame grilled sushi that was talked about. Haha! My server came back and we asked for her recommendation. She is an absolute pro indeed as she literally memorized the menu and the specifics for each dish and recommended which will be fitting for us based on circumstances or dietary restrictions. Very good training, I like that. Back to the food, I ended up ordering the Aburi Oshi Sampler, the Miku Roll and Kaisen Soba Peperonico for dinner plus the Green Tea Opera Cake for dessert. The Aburi Oshi Sampler is wow. The flame grilled adds a different layer of flavour that doesn't overpower the fish as well as the rice is still fresh. Favorite of the sampler is the mackerel one. The Miku Roll is tasty and doesn't have that \"fish\" taste to it. Salmon tasted just right. My favourite is the Kaisen Soba Peperonico. I had soba but never in a stir fried format. Lots of seafood in my plate, plus the scallop is huge, big juicy shrimp. I should of asked for medium spiciness. But I wanted to play it safe. The flavour of the fish was on the heavier end, so the spiciness would of add a flavour to balance out the heavier flavour. Don't get me wrong, I loved it. Then onto dessert. I ordered the Green Tea Opera cake per the server's recommendation. My family was asking how the dessert is, all I did was just eat and enjoy and I totally ignored them. That was how good this dessert was.   Overall experience is WOW! No complaints at all. Will I come back? Yes! I want to try other dishes they have on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and cocktails, but a few negatives and a recent downslide have soured my love of Miku, and resulted in me visiting far less often.  Sushi is the star here, specifically the aburi (blowtorch seared) dishes. The aburi sashimi appetizers are great--I love the Maguro (Tuna) filled with quinoa and topped with onions/sesame. The bulk of my consumption consists solely of the Salmon Aburi Oshi, a delicious sockeye salmon preparation, with delicious sauce on top and a tiny jalapeno slice that gives it the perfect little kick.  Cocktails are delicious, though abhorrently expensive. I love the Miyazaki #2, a rum-based drink with ginger liqueur and the tiniest hint of mango and a delicious citrus foam on top.  Now for the downsides. Firstly, the service is TERRIBLE. Expect to be completely abandoned by your server and have to walk to the bar to place your orders and pay. On the rare occasion you actually have a server come to your table, you might only see them once an hour. Ghastly service, I don't know how they manage to do such a terrible job at this when Swiss Chalet can manage it.  The poor service is even more appalling due to the egregious pricing of their menu. The food is good, but their pricing is, to be frank, utterly absurd. A tiny portion, barely equivalent to an appetizer at most other restaurants, will run you $50. A full lunch here is probably at least $100 per person. We came once for dinner with good appetites and paid about $200-$250 per person, received no service to speak of, and still weren't full at the end of the meal.  The food has also taken a serious downturn recently. I loved the Red Wave Roll, one of their signature items, with avocado, crab meat, and a wrapped piece of Tuna around it. Recently they replaced the crab meat with the most abhorrently disgusting Prawn meat--it tastes awful and is horribly rubbery and not fresh, it completely ruined this, my formerly-second-favourite menu item here. The Red Wave Roll is inedible, since this change.  Ruining previously good menu items is a common practice at Miku Toronto. I used to love the Matcha Chocolate Fondant (lava cake)--they used to accompany it with brandy-sauteed banana slices on the plate with it, along with a delicious chocolate ganache, among other toppings, but they replaced it recently with some bland pistachios and tasteless fruits. Very unfortunate decision to take a good dish and ruin it. Why do they keep doing this?  Between the complete lack of service (seriously, you have to order and pay at the counter 90% of the time), the insanely high prices, and their continuing ruination of previously excellent dishes, I fear Miku will soon lose my business unless they get new management and turn things around."}
{"text":"Miku was great in terms of food. Our server sucked. Inattentive. forgot to bring water 3 times, ordered wine and got it halfway through our meal. We spent around $400, I expected better service. Rice always falls apart here so pieces were hard to pick up. May or may not be back hah but it was good quality sushi for sure."}
{"text":"In Vancouver, Miku is one of my favorite restaurants. The decor and service was excellent and extremely attentive. The decor here is more fancy I would say, the staff was really helpful with the menu and did a great job explaining every dish we ordered. As usual the aburi sushi/sushi menu is my favorite and I believe the best items on the menu. The one things that made me love this location a bit more is the environment. It's less busy than the one in Vancouver so it wasn't noisy and the staff was always available if we needed anything."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, sake, and service!  I started with the Miso soup, which was excellent.  Warm, complex, flavorful, and just the right amount.  I had with it a glass of the Aburi Ginjo, their house sake.  Very light and flavorful.  I then did the Aburi Prime Omakase.  It was AMAZING.  10 pieces of Nigiri, including many types of fish, a geoduck, lobster, uni, and waygu beef.  Each was dressed with a matching sauce and accoutremont, each different.    They were all melt-in-your-mouth, flavorful, complex, and delicious.  Just the right amount of rice to make each piece a good sized, but manageable bite.  With the omakase I had the half-bottle of Sakura sake, which stood up to the bold flavors of the sushi.  For dessert, I had a scoop of miso-salted-caramel ice cream, which was very very good.  The staff were incredibly friendly, courteous and efficient."}
{"text":"Located right by harbour front, this restaurant is definitely one of the most high end sushi restaurants I've ever gone to. Their sushi rolls all cost around $20, but you definitely get what you pay for. The restaurant doesn't leave bottles of soy sauce at tables like most typical sushi restaurants, because their focus is on the flavours in the sushi itself. They also don't serve their sushi with wasabi, which I don't mind because I don't like wasabi. The ginger wasn't the typical pink ginger you would find at most sushi places, which also demonstrates their positioning as a quality sushi restaurant.   I opted for their salmon oishi, which is supposedly one of their signature items. The fish tasted fresh and the rice was cooked to just the right consistency. My only qualm was that it was a bit oily, likely to help char the fish. Although, it was my first time trying pressed sushi, so I don't have anything to compare it to.   The restaurant itself also has a nice atmosphere, with very clean decor, I wouldn't have known it was a sushi restaurant, just based on the overall appearance of the restaurant inside.   If you're a sushi connoisseur or just want to try some high quality sushi, give this place a shot. You might want to make a reservation since they do get busy during dinner service!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant in Toronto. It's not cheap but so worth every penny. I've been to the Vanoucer location which is the original and they are both equally as good. The quality and presentation is exceptional.  They are best known for Aburi sushi prepared using a  flame-seared technique with signature sauces. The sushi just melts like butter in your mouth.  I couldn't get enough and wanted more. The seared Fraser valley pork chop was also amazing. The meat was tender and the mushrooms, baby potato, dry fig really complemented the dish. The restaurant was very busy during a weekday lunch and I've also been there for dinner. I would highly recommend making reservations. The restaurant is very clean and the service is amazing. Our server was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable and provided great suggestions. i would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Expensive but very good. Love the presentation and the ceramics used. Left inspired visually and will go back. Great place to go for fancy dinner or with an expense account ;) ;)"}
{"text":"I think I hyped up myself way too much or had a ridiculously high expectation for Miku because like another review, I found the food to be underwhelming.   My bf and I ordered a couple dishes to share, aburi oshi sushi: one order each of salmon, ebi, and Saba. We also ordered Roasted Hidori chicken supreme, and ichigo mochi for dessert.   I thought everything with the exception of the dessert tasted good but not up to par with the price point. There was just something that was lacking in each dish... the Ichigo mochi on the other hand, WAS AMAZING!!!! The strawberry and raspberry flavours were so concentrated and intense, there was a perfect ratio between the mochi and the strawberry and cream filling, and the cookie added a nice crunch and flavour that tied everything together.   While the food wasn't what I expected, the service from the servers were impeccable.   I probably won't come back unless if my friends or family is throwing their birthday here."}
{"text":"Miku has been floating around in my bookmarks for years. It was always a combination of too expensive and too inconvenient that made it a faraway dream. But I took advantage of Winterlicious 2018 to finally give in. Ok. I get it now. I finally see the light.  I was surprised to find out that Miku was as fusion-y as it was. You don't get a lot of quality Asian fusion places, especially ones that do sushi/sashimi with the same high standards as really good Japanese restaurants in the city. They've got an extensive alcohol list and unique cocktails for the adventurous. I got the non-alcoholic Ginger Basil Smash, which was a little sour, a little sweet, and very smashing indeed.   Despite the higher end dinner price tag of $53, I still believe Miku is one of the best Winterlicious offers out there. Firstly, $53 for a QUALITY 3-course meal is pretty damn good. Don't believe me? Let's break it down:   1) Aburi Sampler Platter - (6 pcs, originally $18) - How special can torched sushi be? Apparently, really special when it comes to Miku. The flavour was stronger than any other Aburi sushi I've had. I contemplated getting more of the torched salmon at regular prices, but I was too full by the end.   2) Bacon Wrapped Beef Tenderloin and Pan Seared Foie Gras Rouge - Not from the regular menu, this was a piece of Winterlicious originality. Everything on the plate tasted amazing, even the brussel sprouts. I can say for certain though that my first bite into the foie gras was the best, most orgasmic bite of the entire meal. It's also pure fatty goose liver goodness so even though you only get 3 small medallions of beef tenderloin, everything together made me quite full.   3) Green Tea Opera - (originally $14.5) - I was more than happy to see their signature dessert on the menu. It's really something special. Rich green tea mousse with crunchy hazelnuts. Served with a tiny scoop of fragrant house-made green tea ice cream. My fiancé had the Japanese Tiramisu. Tasty, but we both agreed the opera was better.   Given the prices of the appetizer and dessert, that puts the beef and foie gras dish at $20! Sometimes, you can't even get a liver pâté dish at that price, let alone a whole piece of foie gras. On top of that, everything was cooked and flavoured to perfection. The prices might be high, but I think the talent behind the cooking justifies it. Quality over quantity makes Miku my Winterlicious winner. Now if only I could get a reservation at Canoe...  (10/100) - 2018"}
{"text":"This place is GOOD. But not cheap. Would probably go again, but instead of ordering a seafood entree - get their sushi instead. Don't come to the restaurant hungry - food is excellent, but small and pricy."}
{"text":"Nice venue, good food but a little overpriced.  Still prefer Jabistro."}
{"text":"We had a girls night out and was pleasantly surprised with the food.  The service was amazing too....total came out to be less than 100$ per head, with saki included.  It was such a nice experience... we would definitely go back soon!"}
{"text":"The salmon aburi oshi is the best thing I have ever had!!!  Like a flavour explosion :) Everything on Miku's menu is top-notch, and the service is always amazing.  Once you eat at Miku,  sushi will never be the same!"}
{"text":"Went to Miku for dinner. The interior is ok wasn't anything special. The menu had a great selection. We got the pickled vegetables, the beef carpaccio, the pressed sushi, uni nigiri and two mixed plates of different sushi's (can't remember the name).   Every dish was amazing and the fish tasted soooooo fresh. The rice was so flavourful and moist. The service was amazing as well because they take the time to explain to you what's on your plate.   Definitely would come back and would get the seafood platter next time! The dessert was also really yummy (matcha ice cream cake)."}
{"text":"I went with a crowd who I let order for me as sushi isn't my go to. I'm going to have to come back and take the menu on for myself. The freshness of every bite was evident and I've been craving it ever since. Lovely space, also."}
{"text":"I was here last week for dinner. It was amazing!  Lin was our server.  She heard we were choosing between set dinners or a la carte and immediately suggested we go for the set dinner. We went for the Shokai and ordered extra oysters on the side.  The Shokai ($80 per person) was a four course meal - for those going for winterlicious, I noticed their winterlicious menu only has 3 courses.  The appetizer was a beautifully prepared seafood platter. Including scallops with ginger sauce, fresh oyster, oyster shooter, seaweed, shrimp cocktails and more. Everything was really good! the only con was I feel there was too much ginger sauce.   The second course was the entree with I believe 5 options. I went for the tuna and fois gras. Also delicious!  Their signature sushi was also well presented. They recommend you DO NOT use additional wasabi or soy sauce. However, I wanted it so asked for it anyways. I feel they can be more lenient towards a customers personal taste. I felt a little shamed for it.  Dessert time - YOU MUST TRY THE GREEN TEA OPERA. I've been told it requires 72 hours to prepare for the layered cake with the essence of hazelnut and green tea fusion. I was already so full by the time dessert came but I ate EVERYTHING. Guess second stomach does exist for great dessert.  Overall it was a very pleasant experience. Lin was an excellent server. She's knowledgable about their food. I couldn't have asked for a better server."}
{"text":"Miku offers a modern \"New York\" sushi resto vibe. They really put in a lot of effort to create this atmosphere which is great for dates, special occasion and business meetings.  Cleanliness, service, and food plating was impeccable. They were fully staffed so that service would run smoothly.   For the prices, i would say that the quality of fish did not meet my expectations. (I came in after hearing all the raves about the vancouver location).   Go for the experience but I would suggest other sushi restaurants for the same quality of fish if not better for less $$$)"}
{"text":"I was excited that Miku opened in Toronto. Now we'll have another torched/pressed sushi place to enjoy. My usual go-to place for that delicious Melt-in-your mouth seared sushi is usually Jabistro. However, after my returning trips to Miku, it has truly won me over. I love how large this space is. No doubt, its great for a small gathering or even larger parties because Miku is a pretty decent sized restaurant compared to most Japanese places. It has a very nice modern vibe to it. Like Guu, you get greeted with people shouting japanese greetings to you as you get lead through the entrance to your table.   Must order:  Miku specialty roll - love the combo of the seared sushi goodness and the ingredients inside the roll (this includes Uni) $22.   Their Oshi sushi (seared pressed sushi) was a little bit small in comparison to Jabistro. I was least impressed with the Ebi Oshi Sushi (rather dry compared to the Jabistro). They did a better job with Salmon and Makeral than their Ebi. I love how the Salmon had a pepper on top and another salmon piece tucked in the middle of the pressed rice.   Dessert: nothing special with their matcha chocolate lava cake.  Order the Matcha opera cake instead please. I love their Jasmin icecream (can order separately or with the chocolate lava cake). Their miso Caramel icecream was an interesting flavour but not my fave.   I love the Sable fish - it was cooked nicely $35 but rather small for two people to share. We also ordered a bunch of other things to try so I guess it worked out.   Other dishes we ordered were not as spectacular as the ones I listed. I would definitely go back for their MIKU roll though!!"}
{"text":"I went to Miku just before the Katy Perry concert and I'm honestly so happy I did.   I was about 45 min late for my reservation (damn Toronto traffic) but when I arrived they still seated me quite quickly! Our server was very informative and helped us order stuff that was quick since we were in a rush.    For appetizers we got the Aburi Beef Carpaccio. I really enjoyed this dish, the beef was nice and melted in my mouth and didn't gross me out. The shoyu egg had just enough flavour to it but wasn't overwhelming. Only thing I didn't like was the wasabi creme because it went up my nose and made me tear up. We also got the Pan Seared Scallops, I've never eaten legit scallops before so I was surprised that it came out in big chunks. The scallops were juicy and sweet and I really liked the palm seeds on the side because you usually don't see palm seed in dishes.   We also got the Oysters on a half shell and to be honest I don't remember the two types of oysters they gave me but I still loved it, it wasn't too fishy and it had a good piece of meat to it where it wasn't too watery to taste.   We then got the Aburi Oshi Sampler and I wish we got more Oshi sushi! Usually I don't eat Saba and salmon is my go to fish for sushi but in this dish I'd have to say I liked the mackerel sooo much more than the salmon! Last main dish we got was half and half of Red Wave Rolls and Miku Roll upon recommendations of our sever. The red wave wasn't my favourite but it still tasted good, but the Miku roll....... probably my favourite thing at Miku. I loved the fun textures that was in a piece that went from crunchy from the cucumber and then the little popping from the tobiko that the roll was covered in.   Lastly for dessert we got the Green Tea Opera and Valrhona Matcha Chocolate Fondant. Both were super good and super chocolate-y. In the green tea opera I was amazed of all the layers and work that was put into the dessert and how it all worked together. The fondant had different types of flavours and textures which made the dessert fun!  Overall I rate Miku 5/5 stars and highly recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"An interesting addition to the Japanese restaurant scene in Toronto coming from Vancouver they specialize in the Aburi style of sushi. To be honest never heard of it. It is essentially nigiri sushi that is rectangular, pressed  and the fish is torched and seasoned. It is good, the fish has a smoky flavor and because of the quick torching it does change the texture of the fish and obviously cooks it a bit. Seems wrong to cook the fish, no?  The good thing is that if you are not into the Aburi style you can also order normal sushi which I did and it was excellent. Also the restaurant is beautiful and spacious with different seating options. A must try.."}
{"text":"This is an more upscale sushi resto within the toronto, comparable to Ja Bistro on Richmond Street. Except the ambiance and the of this place really beats JaBistro. Very spacious, high ceilings with floor to ceiling windows makes this place stand out. Not to mention the modern decor.   The food is amazing here, ordered the Miku Kaiseki course, which gets you to try a mixture of everything on the menu. Ordered a few other plates on top of this, was not a huge fan of the  the soup or the terra cotta dessert but the oysters, aburi, tuna tartare and other sushi/sashimi and the green tea opera cake would definitely take me back there again!   Would recommend this restaurant to everyone looking for a great japanese place in the city and willing to spend a little more for what you're getting"}
{"text":"May 2016: Knew about this Japanese restaurant import from Vancouver. First time here was a surprise Mother's Day brunch. The place was a little hard to find and although there were many doors the only entrance to the restaurant was the one connected to the main lobby. They had a special brunch menu with their signature items. Ordered the special Mother's Day brunch menu, asparagus prosciutto salad, their twist on steak and eggs and green tea opera cake dessert. Also ordered off the menu for the premium aburi sushi platter. My husband got the ebi fritters and seafood aburi sushi and blood orange sorbet. We both got the Yuzu mimosas. The food was amazing from presentation to the taste. Lives up to its west coast roots and a great addition to the Toronto restaurant scene. Very kid friendly as well they had a soba soup noodle available for young children and we requested they add chicken to the soba noodle which they had no problem doing. Also had available vanilla ice cream (made from scratch) for my happy toddler. Service was spectacular. There are no other Japanese restaurants in Toronto serving aburi sushi and quality Japanese fusion dishes. Will definitely go back to try the other dishes soon.  Dec 2017: Since my first visit in 2016 when it opened I've been coming here regularly for both lunch and dinner. This place is consistently a top notch modern Japanese restaurant. The food is modern Japanese fusion, sushi Aburi style and traditional cuisine. I've tried pretty much all the items on their menu. The last two times I was here: one was a dinner with friends celebrating a birthday. We had the calamari, sashimi selection portioned for 8 people, the poached lobster entree, sablefish, prime rib entree. The food and presentation was amazing. It's consistent every time I'm here. For dessert we had green tea open cake, Mochi dome, matcha chocolate fondant, sake frozen yogurt. Last week I had lunch here and ordered al la carte sashimi (scallop, toro, sockeye salmon) and uni nigiri, oysters and the lunch premium sushi platter. Restaurant is pricey but you get quality Japanese cuisine and in a upscale ambiance. Service is friendly and attentive. Love their cocktails. This place remains true to its roots and it's a keeper."}
{"text":"Vancouver based restaurant. Loved the miku roll, salmon pressed sushi and the coal harbour platter, all a must try at miku. They are known for their pressed sushi!"}
{"text":"Miku? More like LITku. It's now one of my most fav. restaurants.  I booked a table via OpenTable a week prior. It gets booked up quick, so make a reservation.  We arrived and they took us to our table. We browsed the menu for a while and decided to order 4 things: Aburi Oshi Plate, Miku Roll, Aburi Prime, Green Tea Opera Cake.  Holy smokes. Everything was impeccable. You really have to consciously slow down your mouth, so that you can appreciate all the flavours.  Everything was fresh and lit af.  A few notes:  Aburi Oshi Plate - The salmon was the undisputed champ here. The saba was nice as well if you like makarel. The ebi was the least preferable / tbh, kinda tasted like a yellow starburst.  Miku Roll - it was lit. There's a reason it's named after the restaurant.  Aburi Prime - this was the grand masterpiece. I've never had such high quality, decorative sushi before. Everything from the various tunas to uni was presented. I highly recommend this one. Though it's pricey, I justified it by treating it as an experience, not just food.  Green Tea Opera Cake - this cake was amazing. You must order it if you come to Miku. I have dreams about the dark chocolate with the green tea and raspberry, etc all melding tgh in my mouth.  Service was great. I made a note in the OpenTable reso, saying that it was my companion's bday. I didn't even have to mention it in person and they still remembered to write \"Happy B Day\" on the dessert plate. My companion was both impressed and confused as to how they knew.  Save Miku for a special occasion, it will change your life for the better."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate my birthday a few days ago because of all the great things I've heard about it! I was extremely excited, and rightfully so. This restaurant has a fancy upscale vibe to it and looks stunning on both the inside and outside. The atmosphere is perfect for a celebration, but still OK for a casual meal. I came mainly to try the aburi sushi, and it truly was the highlight of my dinner!  The service was GREAT. Everyone was so polite and friendly from the moment we walked in to when we walked out. The servers are incredibly attentive and the food expeditors really make sure to describe what your dish is made out of as they come out. I really liked the detail in these descriptions. The place is pricey, but it's worth it for the quality of food and service. Overall, I had an amazing time at Miku!  Here is a small breakdown of what I ordered and my thoughts on it:  Albacore Tuna and Wakame Tartare ($18) - thought this tasted pretty good. The tuna was fresh, and it came with avocados which is my favourite. It was a cool item to try, but I probably wouldn't buy it again.  Salmon Oshi Sushi ($17) - this was the best part of my dinner and I would honestly come back just to buy this again. I absolutely love it! And you probably won't be able to find aburi sushi like this in Toronto (other than at JaBistro).  Red Wave Roll ($18) & Miku Roll ($22) - got 1/2 of each. Both were must haves!! I personally enjoyed the red wave roll much more though (not a big fan of uni, but I LOVE tuna).   Aburi Sushi Sampler ($20) - perfect dish to start off with because you get to try a variety of different things! I'd totally recommend this to anyone who's in for trying something new.  Atlantic Salmon Sashimi (6 pieces for $16) - salmon sashimi has always been one of my favourite things to eat, but I didn't find anything too special about the sashimi here. Tasted great, fresh, but not TO DIE FOR or anything like that! Just average.  Uni (Sea Urchin) and Cho Toro (Tuna Belly) at market prices - I LOVED the tuna so much!! I want to go back just to have more! Didn't enjoy the uni at all though. It was my first time trying it, and it tastes extremely seafoody! It's a bit of an acquired taste and was certainly not right for me.  Green Tea Opera Dessert ($13) - the green tea ice cream tasted pretty regular to me, but the CAKE with many layers to it was absolutely delicious! Must try if you're into the green tea flavour."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong I love this place. The food was amazing, it's definitely worth going for any special occasions etc. Service was good...until yesterday.   Our server was hella sarcastic and rude. There were 7 of us and six of us ordered our food while waiting for the seventh to arrive. Two of my girl friends are small eater so they ordered one holiday menu set to share. He had this judging look on his face but I didn't bother. When the seventh person came, he recommended what to order to that friend and he was being sarcastic about my two girl friends that are sharing one holiday set. \"The menu's supposingly just enough for one person but they are sharing it.. which is not enough\" along with that tone    Next part was when the lady was gonna fill up my empty glass of water. When she picked up my glass, our server saw her from the other end of the table and went like \"hey no wrong table\". She was still going to fill up my empty glass first but he went on again \"hey no not them behind\" so she put down my glass, left my glass of water empty and went to the table behind me. Since she already lifted my glass, was IT so hard for her to just fill up my water first? Just because she went to the wrong table doesn't mean I don't need my glass of water filled? She could've just filled in my glass of water first and then move on to the next table?   After that, the plating guy came with two of the prime rib entrees my friends ordered, and while he was putting one down, he accidentally spilled the gravy from the other plate onto another girl friend's chair and it splattered on her bag (she went to the washroom). He tried to clean it but it's a suede bag so it was not removable at that point. However, he didn't stay to apologize to my friend. As if it never happened. When my friend came back from the washroom, she knew nothing and she had to find out from us and her stained bag.   This, is the worst of all. when we're going to pay, that friend of mine went up to the server and told him about the spill and that the staffs should be more careful. We were supposed to pay 18% tips cuz we're a large group but cuz of the gravy incident he took off the tip part from the bill so my friend could pay lesser tip. I'm not sure if the server assumed she didn't want to pay tip, but he was very rude at the end of it. I'm not sure if our tips go directly towards him or what, but he sure was furious about not including the tips in the bill.   \"are you going to blame me for my staff's actions? Just want to let you know that what you do will affect my life\" (exact words)   EVERYONE of us still paid 18% of tips cuz we know we're not affected by that incident while that friend paid half of it. After we all paid, he only wished me happy birthday, thanked my boyfriend for coming (our bill was pretty high up) and left without thanking the rest of the group.   My friend wanted to make a complain to the manager, but we figured we wouldn't make a fuss at the scene. I'd still go back for the food someday, but I certainly do not hope to encounter these kind of services, EVER."}
{"text":"Good place to grab bougie sushi! Was very eager to try this place out since I heard it open in Toronto. Came very hungry and very excited about the aburi (torched) sushi.  Started off with the coal harbour seafood platter. Came with a selection of mussels, clams, two different type of raw oyster, one tiger prawn and scallops on an olive oil. SKIP THIS OPTION. Nothing too special about it. Everything was steamed and no real taste. Just your average seafood platter.   Next, we ordered a variety of sashimi. The sashimi comes in orders of 6 pieces, which you can get half orders of. The sashimi was very fresh. They brought it all out on a huge platter and it all looked very carefully platted. My favourite was the uni and the big shrimp. The salmon was very lean, which I'm not a fan of (I like seeing white stripes on my salmon). They ran out of o toro by the time we were there :(  We also ordered the calamari, which was very tote worthy! Worth ordering if you're a calamari lover like most of the people I was dining with.  We ended up ordering all three types of aburi oshi sushi, salmon, mackerel and shrimp. This is the torched press sushi. I was a bit disappointed with the rolls. The rice is very sweet and soft. I would say my favourite was the shrimp one. Maybe it's because they have lean salmon and so when they blow torch the salmon, it doesn't release as much oil... But either way, I was a bit let down by these rolls.  However, the Miku roll in itself was very tasty. I would say this was the highlight of the dinner. We ordered a half order but I wish we had gotten more. THIS IS A MUST ORDER!  Along with the sushi, we also ordered the prime rib and baked lobster. I didn't get to try the prime rib because I was too full but heard it was good. The lobster was baked in a lemon Cajun mix and was pretty spicy!!!   The restaurant is located inside the Waterpark building. Parking is available downstairs for $15. The restaurant is very modern and has very beautiful decor. Definitely a good place to impress a date or have a birthday dinner. The price and ambience wouldn't call for a \"go-to\" sushi place.   IMO, really enjoyed my experience at Miku. Would definitely come back here for a special occasion. However, for the price and the quality of sashimi and torched rolls, I think I'd rather go to JaBistro :)"}
{"text":"For lunch, I recommend the Premium Sushi Lunch - includes 12 unique rolls, a mix of torched and maki style sushi. Each piece has it's only distinct unique flavours, so delicious!! The Red Wave Roll and the Miku Rolls are also very good.  I also ordered the Miku Zen but felt a little ripped off, the individual mini dishes didn't knock my socks off compared to the sushi. I would just stick to the torched sushi, their specialty.  Overall, the sushi is outstanding but of course it comes with a hefty price. I still think the Vancouver one Is slightly better (The view is definitely much better in Vancouver). With more sushi restaurants now serving torched sushi, I may want to try those restaurants before coming back to Miku."}
{"text":"Sashimi lunch was excellent. I liked all the fish options when normally I find certain fishes to be quite sour. Everything was extremely fresh and the pickled sides were yummy. The seared salmon roll with jalapeño was good, it didn't add spice so I wish it added something to it. Really enjoyed our lunch here and it's nice to be so close to harbour front."}
{"text":"My first time here. We had the Miku Zen & their Signature Aburi Sushi. Everything is fantastic. Fine food, Good atmosphere & Great service. We definitely will go back with friends & family."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was fine. What got to me was right after we finished our ice creams (like literally 10 seconds after) the bill was shoved onto the table without us asking. It was the end of the lunch hour, so not many tables... not sure if our server was ending her shift but there was no explanation. Also, not sure if this is common practice, but the last time I came, this didn't happen.  edit: I have contacted them."}
{"text":"Service is great and the food is spectacular! This place fulfilled all my sushi needs. I got the premium sushi lunch my first time here and was really impressed with the variety, flavours and freshness of the entire place. Would absolutely come back!"}
{"text":"The Miku waterfront platter was amazing. It came in two platters one for the oyster/clams and another for the sashimi. The ingredients were fresh and the presentation was great. However there was 6 of us, and it was difficult to share, especially with 3 pieces of each sashimi.   We tried each of the Aburi oshi sushi. My favourite was the ebi oshi sushi with pressed prawn and lime zest. The prawn was very tender and the lime zest gave it a nice kick. However, the aburi sushi is fairly expensive compared to other places with the same quality and taste.   Green tea opera desert is definitely a must try in the menu."}
{"text":"Solid sushi restaurant.  Great if you like \"experimental\" sushi like toro with truffles and hamachi with foie gras.    Their claim to fame is the seared sushi which was quite tasty.    Their main downfall is that their rice is not up to a par imho.  The flavor is good but the consistency is off.  I know a lot of people might be thinking \"who cares about the rice!\"  Well, rice is half of the ingredients in sushi so it's just as important as the actual fish imho.  The perfect harmony of fish and rice is what makes good sushi.   Overall, it's a good place to try once or go for special occasions."}
{"text":"I've been to the MIku restaurant in Vancouver and loved it, and to see it open in Toronto I was ecstatic. I've been to this restaurant 3 times so far and had a great dinner experience every time. The waiters and waitresses were all very friendly and attentive and the open concept kitchen is very nice if sitting by the bar. During one visit. my waiter asked if I was celebrating a special occasion and I told him it was my birthday and when we ordered dessert the plate came with a happy birthday message with my name on it (he knew my name by looking at the reservations); excellent service!   As for the food, everything was excellent from preparation to presentation. My favorite items would have to be the Miku roll, and the salmon and mackerel pressed sushi, extremely flavorful, fresh and tasty. Expect to spend at least $60 per person for dinner or else you leave hungry. Also recommend to reserve ahead of time as this place is very busy for dinner, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"After a rough start, I can see why our Yelp Winterlicious thread said that Miku was all booked up for this event. I made my reservation about 15 minutes after reservations opened for 'licious. They did a follow up call with me yesterday to remind me of our reservation. We booked for 11:30am today, which is also when they open.  We got there at 11:25am ish. We walked in and were told the restaurant didn't open til 11:30am. We were asked to sit outside on the benches until then. I've never had a restaurant do that to me before. I'm still befuddled by it. Would it have been better to be late for my reservation so you could open the doors before I got there? Thankfully, after the doors opened and we were seated, everything went smoothly.  I already knew what I wanted, so I basically ordered for our party of three. Two Miku Zen, one sashimi plate, two Aburi sushi plates, one maguro chirashi, Two green tea operas, and one chocolate croissant bread pudding. Basically, we opted not to try the vegetarian options and the ice cream/sorbet.  Sashimi plate - 2 salmon, 2 tuna, 2 hamachi + kaisen poke (I cannot remember what kind this was). All of the sashimi was super fresh. It was served with two types of soy sauce flavored with citrus, I think. I didn't even use wasabi. The kaisen poke was quite small (three or four bites of fish) and had a fairly strong sesame aroma.  Miku Zen - I was pleasantly surprised with how much food was in this appetizer sampler. I thought each would be a one bite sort of deal, but each of the four dishes was about the size of a starter salad. There were three nicely seared slices of albacore tuna with a marinated onion sauce. The onion sauce was delicious, but slightly overpowering. The ebi fritter was delicious. The prawn was juicy and the batter was oh so crisp. The beef tenderloin skewers weren't as hot as I'd have liked them to be, but that might be because I had the sashimi first, and the skewers might have cooled down. They were cooked about medium rare. The sweet and sour soy with the wasabi gremolata (I have no idea what this means but this is what the menu said) were delicious. I did not taste any wasabi. I did taste cilantro. The baby potatoes were sliced and fried. They were really cute. The brussels sprouts were crispy and amazing. The salad was fresh and tasty, but I did not realize there was supposed to be miso marinated tofu in it. I did not have any tofu and neither did my brother. Huh.   Aburi sushi plate - The aburi nigiri were hamachi and shrimp today. The hamachi was delicious and the accompanying garnish had a wasabi kick which was pleasant. The Queen's Quay roll went to mush in my mouth. My brother would say tender. I was not impressed, but it was still tasty. The salmon oshi and the saba oshi ( the salmon and mackerel pressed sushi pieces) were by far the best pieces of sushi I've had to date. Both were incredibly flavorful and incredibly soft while still retaining enough structure not to fall apart when picked up. The jalepeno on the salmon oshi delivered a small amount of heat to the sushi, but it didn't burn. The saba was the least fishy piece of saba I've ever eaten. I like the fishiness of saba, but this was impressive. The saba was my favorite bite of this entire meal. Oh. The sushi rice here is magical. It's sweet has an almost oily mouth feel. I am not a fan of rice, but I could  eat this rice plain.   Maguro chirashi - This was adorable. Lots of little garnishes and different forms of fish. It looks nothing like the maguro chirashi that comes up if you type maguro chirashi miku into google images. There was negitoro (almost like raw tuna paste with little bits of other stuff in it) that looked unappetizing but tasted good, tuna sashimi which was super tender, and more of their kaisen poke. There was also marinated kale, assorted pickled veggies, and tamago. The tamago was tasty. The kaisen poke in this dish was a tad too torched. It was burnt tasting in an acrid way. All in all though, still delicious. That they use their sushi rice as a base helps a lot.  Chocolate croissant bread pudding - There was chocolate in here? I did not know. My mother and my brother really enjoyed this. I liked it, but at the end of the day, it's bread pudding. I can make bread pudding. I did not taste the miso or salt in the caramel. The candied sesame pralines were my favorite part. I wish there had been a few more of those. The bread pudding itself was very fluffy, which I appreciate. Tasty, but I prefered the opera.  Green Tea Opera - I can see why this is their signature dessert. This was like eating a green tea/red bean kitkat/kinder bueno on crack. It was tiny, but there were so many flavors and textures going on. The matcha ice cream was amazing too. It's perhaps the best I've ever had. Not sweet after eating the cake though.  Service was pleasant. No space for more details.  I'd come again for 'licious. Not sure about regular menu."}
{"text":"I ordered a red wave roll and order of edamame. The red wave roll was delightful and a flavorful non fried choice. I also ordered the rose by the glass which went well. The service was friendly and attentive. I was visiting from the US and the server recommended other restaurants and even wrote them down for me. Overall it was a nice relaxing lunch and a chic atmosphere."}
{"text":"So happy Toronto has a Miku as well. The food is amazing! Ambiance feels a little corporate. Great spot for weekday lunches but lacks the cozy feel for my type of dinner spot. You won't be disappointed though!"}
{"text":"Right now, this is my favourite sushi join in this part of TO.  GF options, check. GF tamari, check. High quality food, check. Great presentation, check. Soft spoke and professional service, check. Clean and comfortable atmosphere, check. Careful with allergy issues, check.  Went here for lunch, enjoyed it so much, came back for dinner the same day.  Staff recognized us and welcomed us back using our names.  Will be back, next time, photos for sure!"}
{"text":"It was quite an experience.  Came here with a few friends and we had reserved a table just in case. The decor inside is nice with the place filled up on a Thursday night.  It was a bit windy outside so did not choose a table in the patio to enjoy the view even though the street can be busy with cars and streetcars.  They have a nice selection of sake as well as their specialty sushi.  We ordered the sashimi chef special which was $25 per person served on a shared platter. We ordered some other dishes including seaweed salad and their signature blowtorched pressed sushi. We also had a few bottles of sake to complement the sushi.  Be prepared to bring your wallet. Although it is a memorable experience, you likely will only come on special occasions for dinner.  I believe lunch is somewhat more economical from what my friends have told me but it would be too rushed for me. Definitely worth a try if you want more high-end sushi at a restaurant with great decor."}
{"text":"Our first time at this Vancouver originated restaurant.  After seeing them renovate \"forever\", we finally got a chance to eat here.  The claim to fame here is the \" blow torch sushi.  And it does not disappoint!    We ordered the taster menu and added extra desserts along with the house sake.  The entire meal was beautifully presented on the plate and also by the servers.  Loved the meal.  A bit pricy but we will be back!"}
{"text":"Miku where have you been all my life! Upon walking in, I was immediately impressed by the clean minimalist design and the bright airy dining space. The black napkins and chopsticks pop against the white tables and chairs. They have outdoor seating options but it was far too hot outside to enjoy our meal there. One has the option of sitting at the sushi bar but a 4-5 inch wall inhibits one's ability to have an interactive viewing/photographic/dining experience there. Their large wine and sake fridge is rather impressive and takes up the greater part of a wall. The washrooms are nicely appointed with 3 floor to ceiling stalls and nice smelling soap :) Our server AJ was delightful and gave us spot on suggestions.   As it was our first time dining at Miku and for a more formal dining experience in celebration of our anniversary, hubby and I decided to order 2 types of Kaiseki - a 4 course and a 5 course (the Aburi Kaiseki option required 3 days advanced notice). Our first course was impressively plated. We had supplemented hubby's 4 course menu with an order of seared scallops which were incredible! I don't know what they put in the scallops dish but I found the dish tender, slightly creamy, buttery from the prince mushroom, and very satisfying. The ebi was unbelievably sweet and tender. One has the option of returning the shrimp head to one's server to fry up and enjoy at a later course. Although odd to me to be eating the shell, the fried shrimp head was flavourful and crunchy. Every piece of fish was expertly prepared, garnished and plated.   Each dish built upon the next. The bouillabaisse was nicely balanced in flavour. The squid, fish, potatoes, and herbs were texturally tender, vibrant in their flavours, and the broth itself was very comforting. Our main entrées consisted of sablefish and prime rib (cooked sous vide for 4 hours) which were so tender that you almost didn't need to chew your food, that's how close it came to melting in your mouth! Of notable mention is their signature aburi, or torched sushi, which was smoky, rich, and had a great mouthfeel. There was no need to mask the fish in soy sauce or wasabi as the freshness and flavour of the fish spoke for itself.    Of all the dishes, my faves were the seared scallops  and the sablefish. We appreciated the personal touch of the anniversary greeting of \"happy anniversary\" inscribed in chocolate milk is on our dessert plates. I would definitely recommend trying Miku's kaiseki menu perhaps to celebrate a special occasion as it can cost between $78-$130  per person. After this first dining experience at Miku, I will have a hard time going back to other run of the mill sushi places!"}
{"text":"Came here on Friday night. The place was filled and packed with people so I definitely recommend getting a reservation if you can. We unfortunately didn't have one but they were able to seat us at the bar. Food was absolutely amazing and very well presented. Everyone from the servers to bartender and those who came out with our food was extremely knowledgeable of the menu items. Our server made superb recommendations"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Love the food and desserts. EVERYTHING melts in your mouth!! We have some roles and sushi and all of them were top notch. You MUST try the green tea opera dessert- it taste so amazing. I'll definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"Ever since it opened in Toronto, there was a lot of hype about Miku so I finally went here for Winterlicious Dinner. A very nice authentic Japanese restaurant, I've heard raving reviews and nothing but good things about Miku. When we arrived, we noticed the beautiful décor and interior decorated very nicely and it comes with that upscale feeling of dining at a fine dining restaurant. The regular looks quite extensive with so many unique and interesting dishes. We of course opted for the Winterlicious menu which was $48 for a 3 course meal. I ordered the Miku Signature Aburi Sushi Selection which has the Salmon Oshi Sushi, Ebi Oshi Sushi, Coal Harbour Roll, Red Wave Roll and Aburi Nigiri. The selection was quite nice, delicious and the flavours of each one were mind blowing to say the least. Normally, when you dine at these authentic Japanese restaurants, you can expect that they don't give soy sauce and wasabi. This has got to be one of the best sushi appetizers I've had at a Japanese restaurant so it speaks volume of the quality of the food here. For the entre, I decided to try something different than my usual meat protein dish. I ordered the Kyoto Saikyo Miso Baked Sable Fish & Yuzu Butter Poached Half Atlantic Lobster Tail with tuscan kale and root vegetables, cauliflower fritter, eggplant purée, quinoa, wasabi chimichuri and tomato chutney. The sablefish was cooked perfectly with great seasoning and very flavourful. The lobster was good and it was good they separated the meat from the tail already on the dish. For the dessert, I ordered the Chocolate Croissant Bread Pudding with miso salted caramel sauce, Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream and candied sesame pecan. It was quite delicious and not too sweet so a good choice to end such a great meal. Overall, I was impressed on the dining experience and the flavours of the sushi prepared by the chef. Definitely a great experience and I must come back to try their regular menu!! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous Japanese restaurant from Vancouver. The aburi style sushi gives the food a unique and delicious flavour. My wife and I enjoy the booth seating or aburi sushi bar seating the most."}
{"text":"I took my wife to Miku for her birthday. I must start by saying the staff is really friendly, accommodating and helpful. Our server Lynn was delightful, knowledgeable and had perfect \"service sensibilities\". If you are driving, there is underground in the same building but it is pricey ( and no validation either), but you go to Miku not caring too much about how much things cost really (not to sound boastful but it was my wife's birthday). We initially sat outside but found it a little too noisy and my wife preferred inside as the ambiance was refreshing, clean and inviting. We had the seafood platter, sashimi assortment and two sushi rolls. They were beautifully presented, good portion sized and most importantly the taste was impeccable. Really inspired, creative and detailed gourmet fair. The Miku roll was melt in your mouth delectable with a touch of smoke flavouring using aburi technique. We had a bottle of Saki which was a perfect recommendation by Lynn but it was pricey at $50. Not sure if I would order the Saki again. Our meal came to $220 which is pricey but I was more than satisfied with the meal, service and experience."}
{"text":"I was anticipating great things from this newly opened resto with its spot-on food pics and the apparent hype so the subsequent letdown was pretty rough..   Located inside the RBC Waterpark building, miku doesn't have street front entrance so it could be easily missed. With its high ceilings, bright lights and fancy decor, this newly renovated space seemed promising BUT when it got to the food, my money on a final bill of $200 for 2 ppl (including tax & tips) could have been MUCH better spent elsewhere.  1) Aburi Oshi Sushi ($17) - this is their famous flame seared pressed sushi. We ordered half order of salmon and half order of the mackerel (the salmon was better). Honestly I think our server hyped it up a bit too much for us, she made it sound like it would be life changing but honestly it was just alright. It was obvious from the first bite that the quality of sushi rice here was not on par..  2) Miku Roll ($22) - salmon, crab, uni, cucumber and their Miku sauce. Sounded great on paper but was underwhelming.. wasn't able to taste the uni but I did like the crunchy salt pieces they had on top of the flame torched salmon that added interesting texture.  3) Miku Signature sushi set ($36) - this set had all their favourites so seemed like a good option to get a bit of everything (including the aburi oshi sushi and miku roll) so if you get this you might not need to get #1 or 2 above.   4) Aburi Prime ($55) - reasonably priced omakase experience and was supposed to be the highlight of the night. However, not the freshest fish and I think all the toppings they put on top of the sushi really takes away from the whole experience as seemed much more gimmicky than for taste. Japaleno, orange and okra pieces on top of your sushi?  To be fair they serve Japanese fusion here so if you enjoy fusion style sushi or having prime rib as an option on the menu, you might like it better than I did.. but to me it was a classic case of wishing the real thing tasted as good as the photos. You are looking at a place that serves sake in a wine glass.. it may rock some people's boat but unfortunately not mine."}
{"text":"Their sushi is very good.  I would avoid the main entrees, they're quite mediocre for the price.  The primerib however, was quite nice, if a little bland.  Just stick to the japanese fare and you'll be more than pleased.  I come here often for lunch and occasionally for dinner and the Ebi Oshi always puts a smile on my face."}
{"text":"I've been there for three times to try different dishes. They never disappoint me, from starters to sushi to main dish to dessert to drinks, they deserves a five star. Oh, one thing to mention, service was too slow at the patio, a lot better when sitting inside."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Miku since it's open. Deeply disappointed by the service and small selection of food. The server didn't come to my table until 15 mins after seating. I wanted to order Uni Sashimi but they told me they don't sell it since it's out of season. Then please remove it from the menu! The chef's cutting skills are terrible.  Couldn't even separate the sashimi properly."}
{"text":"Miku is a known Japanese restaurant from Vancouver with lots of good praises from Vancouver, so when they opened their Toronto store, I told myself I HAVE to come here!  Booking was easy as they are on OpenTable, but just remember when you book, you are booking the Toronto and not Vancouver location (they have different websites!).  Including myself with 4 other friends, we made a booking for Friday at 730pm.  As we walked in, we had people immediately greeting us, offering coat checks and quickly seated at our booth table.  First impression, decoration is very modern, upscale, bright and beautiful.  Our booth seats were very intimate and comfortable.  After browsing through the menu, we ordered: Smoked Soy Grilled Octopus, Pan Seared Scallops, AAA Sterling Silver Prime Rib, all three Aburi Oshi Sushi (Salmon, Ebi, Saba), Miku Roll, Miku Signature Sushi Selection, Green Tea Opera and Fuji Apple Tatin.  We also ordered Gold Omachi and Nakano Ume Sake!  Appetizers (good for 4 people per order): The Octopus from the Smoked Soy Grilled Octopus appetizer was grilled to perfection, the tentacles were very tender and easy to chew. The other ingredients blended in well with the octopus.  The Pan Seared Scallops on the other hand, although beautifully displayed and large, the taste lacks a little flavour.  Entree (Good for 6 people): AAA Sterling Silver Prime Rib (10oz) was a lot larger than expected, it comes auto medium rare which was perfect for me.  Prime Rib was juicy and the sauce was great.  The side baked potatoes and mushrooms were also equally as impressive!  I highly recommend.  Sushi: Out of all the three Aburi Oshi Sushi, I highly recommend the Saba and Salmon as both had great amount of oil from the blowtorching and the sauce pairing were tremendous!  I recommend eating the Salmon before the Saba as the latter has a much stronger flavour that will overshadow the salmon.  Mike Roll was decent, but was not superbly impressive, still worth a try if you are feeling for rolls with Uni (Sea urchin) and don't actually taste it much.  In terms of the Nigiri we got from the Miku Signature Sushi Selection, I though the Nigiri was the weakest link in terms of their sushi lineup.  The fish was just normal as it didn't give me the \"wow\" moment compare to my first bite on the Abrui Oshi Sushi.  Desserts: Out of the two we ordered, I preferred the Green Tea Opera more.  It comes with a VERY strong matcha (green tea) ice cream with match cake on the side.  Both were very delicious and 5 of us did fight for this dessert more than the Fuji Apple Tatin.  Sake: Large selection of Sake, but they were EXPENSIVE and tasted good!  The Ume Sake was a little too fruity and sweet for me (plum sake) so I preferred the Gold Omachi more (suited for warm drinking sake style).  The Gold Omachi was VERY smooth and I really enjoyed it.  Overall, I really enjoyed my dinner experience on Friday.  I would give this 4.5 if yelp allows, but since it can't and I have to pick between a 4 or 5, I had to give this restaurant a 4.  The 1 missing start is because this restaurant was a bit weak on the Nigiri sushi we had, and I think for a Japanese restaurant, Nigiri is and should be one of their better items on the menu.  Having said that, I will definitely come here again for another meal!!"}
{"text":"Everything at Miku from the service to the food was amazing! Definitely the best sushi in town. Here's what we ordered:  Coal harbour platter (reg. size) - very fresh and tasty (note: it only comes with one oyster shot so it's best to order another one if there's two of you)  Aburi Oshi Plate and Aburi Sushi Sampler - Best torched sushi I've ever had.  Soft Shell Crab Roll - The soft shell crab was really crunchy and the sauce was good  Miku Roll - I forgot what was in this, but I definitely recommend ordering this one when you're here  Overall, I would definitely come back here and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to eat sushi (and don't mind spending $$$ on it).  P.S. our server was awesome. I believe his name was Lotus and he was really energetic and recommended all the right things from our drinks to the menu items."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for! Nice atmosphere, attentive and friendly staff, solid food with great presentation. A perfect place for special occasions :)   We had to try their signature blowtorched pressed sushi! We first ordered the salmon one which was so good that we had to order the mackerel one too! My boyfriend and I both liked the mackerel one over the salmon one just because it was more flavorful. The highlight of the meal was their dessert! Absolutely loved their matcha molten lava cake and a matcha opera cake. I savored each bite of them. Maybe I am a bit biased (yes I am) because I have a huge sweet tooth + love anything matcha haha   Overall, worth coming out to this great restaurant! Does anyone have a tip for parking here? We parked at the same building, and it was very pricey :( I could have had two more desserts..."}
{"text":"Food and decor was fantastic. This may sound weird but I was super impressed by the quality of the rice. We ordered the Miku Zen, Beef Carpaccio, and the Premium sushi lunch set. Even though the carpaccio was good it did not impress me. Miku Zen was something prefect to warm up your stomach and try a multitude of cooking techniques. Recommend highly as a light lunch and to try different things. The highlight was definitely the sushi. OMG. One of the best aburi sushi I have had. Not too overpowering or greasy like many places. The sauces highlight the fish and does not overwhelm your palate. However, the service was great at the beginning but as it got busy we were slightly forgotten. Can't fully blame our waitress, as it seemed her assigned tables were all over the place. We just were not able to leave fully content as we were late and got frustrated."}
{"text":"This was place was good but not great.  For the price the food and selection should have been better.  With these prices I would expect NOBU quality but it wasn't quite there.  The ambience and service were both very good.  The dress was better than casual.  There were a lot of couples there and it seemed to be a date spot.   I can't stress enough that the service was top notch, though."}
{"text":"Salmon oshi is to die for - I dream about it literally. The crispy seared top of the salmon melting into a warm, buttery middle is nooooo joke. Definitely a must have on the menu and in my opinion well worth the price."}
{"text":"The venue is nice, situated close to the waterfront in the first floor of a building. There's no view but is nicely decorated and the staff are nice. We came for lunch so there was no set menu   Entree: Miku Zen 3/5 Selection of chef's preferences, so it will differ Included small dishes of Salad, Beef cheek, Sable fish, Albacore I didn't find this particularly unique or tasty, was kinda bummed out  Salmon Oshi Sushi 4/5 Apparently the must have for this place Its a nigiri with salmon inside and on the top with a layer of mayo like paste that is flamed I thought the mayo was overwhelming and too fatty  Albacore belly sashimi 5/5 Pretty fresh, had 2 types of soy sauce: standard and sweet  Dessert: Green tea opera 5/5 Pretty good!  It had many layers including a crispy layer, a pistachio tasting layer and some more.  Warm matcha chocolate fondant 5/5 The chocolate oozes out of the fondant and is coupled with a side of matcha icecream  If you like fusion japanese then this is your spot. I prefer traditional japanese so I will likely not come back, worth a try though."}
{"text":"The sushi here was good, but since they tend to grill most of their fish (aburi style), I kind of feel like it hides whether the fish is actually fresh or all that good. We got the omakase - chef's selection. The selection wasn't that interesting, other than some of the fish coming out aburi style. We got one of each of their main aburi offerings in the omakase -- the salmon, the shrimp, and the eel. Each of the fish on these pieces already packed a lot of natural oils, so I thought it really didn't make sense when the chef paired the fish with some type of mayo-type sauce... it was just too much richness. The rest of the omakase came with pretty standard offerings -- scallop, tuna, yelowfin, etc.  On top of ok food, this place also had pretty bad service. My friend and I had a reservation and had arrived on time, but we still got seated after they sat down another group of 2 that had arrived after us. After we got seated, our waiter also took our order after she had taken the order for another table that got seated after us. We also had to ask every once in awhile to get our waters refilled. I suspect that the reason for the poor service was because we weren't as nicely dressed as some of the other groups. But if that's how this place treats customers, I definitely won't be returning here."}
{"text":"Tastes so awesome omg I will come back ?????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"There is nothing bad I can say about Miku. Everything was phenomenal for me! I'll try my best to break down my experience.  Atmosphere: the decor is very slick and contemporary, but the feel is relaxed as well. There doesn't seem to be a dress code as customers ranged from casual jeans, to business attire, to dressed to impress. A semi casual is probably best, but really however you're feeling that day seems good.  Service: The serving team here deserve the highest of praise from me. Everyone was phenomenal. I came during winterlicious, and often times, because it's busier or what have you, the service usually lacks effort. That is not the case here! Everyone was polite and helpful. Offering recommendations, describing each course and cocktail as they served it, and periodical check ins with you. The service really elevated the experience for me.  Food: O-M-G!!! I love sushi in general, but after eating at Miku, I was left wondering what it was that I was eating before? I got the aburi sushi selection and my husband got the sashimi. Amazing! The fish was so tender that it melted in your mouth. For the sushi selection each roll or piece of sushi had different flavourings and it was all very well complemented and distinctive. For our entrées we both got the lobster tail and sablefish, and it was incredibly tender and delicious. I think we would have licked our plates clean if we could have! Dessert was fantastic too. I ordered the green tea opera cake which was the perfect balance of sweet. Not overly sweet and the layers were distinctive. My husbands tiramisu was incredibly light and creamy. Everything exceeded expectations.  A memorable meal!"}
{"text":"I came here for a corporate lunch on a Wednesday, and had a reservation for 4 people at 12pm. The restaurant was not packed, and looked like it could accommodate many walk-ins.   The service we received was great. The server gave us recommendations and advised us when he thought an order would be too small (and he was right).   I had the Sashimi Lunch and it was delightful. The presentation was amazing and classy, and the fish was fresh! The decor/ambiance is very modern, bright, and open.   I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"AM I EATING BUTTER OR FISH? THE ABURI ROLLS ARE TOO GOOD.  Miku left my mind blown and my mouth in heaven. Make a reservation here ASAP and please get the Aburi Oshi Sushi. You will not be disappointed.  Rolls/Oshi In order of preference 1. Mizu roll -  Roll (obvi) instead of sushi like the others. This was amazing. I can't even. Love the layers of different textures of the soft fish, crunchy cucumbers and popping tobiko. 2. Salmon  - Sockeye salmon- so buttery :O 3. Saba - Cured makeral- may be fishy for some but it was so tender I really liked it.  4. Ebi - Prawn-  lime zest with shrimp not my favorite pairing of flavours.  We also got the Miku Waterfall with our sushi. The presentation was grand and came with really fresh sashimi (although Jabistro IMO is better) but the other seafood (oysters, mussels, prawns, ceviche) was pretty average and didn't blow my mind like the Oshi. Next time I would just get the Miku roll and Oshi.  With the dinner, we  got a bottle of umami sake. It was a very interesting savory flavour unlike any other booze I've ever had before. I would recommend trying it warm!  The meal ended with the green tea opera dessert and it was bomb. One of the best desserts I've ever had at a Japanese restaurant and the presentation is hella intricate.   The space is super trendy with modern furnishings. Clean lines, high ceilings, a sake wall and lots of space from other diners unlike many cramped sushi places.  I'm so love with this place."}
{"text":"I've been here once and after ordering a ton of food with my friends, I ordered the uni and was sadly disappointed. The uni was not fresh at all. It was borderline spoiled. My parents went a few months down the line for a special occasion of theirs. They came back to tell me that this place is overrated and overpriced for what it is. Along with the rest of their order, they got oysters. One of the oysters were not edible and my dad had to spit it out as fast as he could but not before some of it was already ingested. The restaurant should definitely make up for this error considering the level of establishment they claim to be. But all they did was replace the 1 oyster. Seriously?  My dad came home with food poisoning.  The single star goes to the design of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious...let me start there.   We had the carpaccio as a first course. Best carpaccio ever. Hands down. We were actually going to order a second plate, but we had so much food ordered.   The lobster entree is pricey, but so worth it. It is a little spicy...so note that.    We also ordered one of the sushi platters. Chefs choice of 9 or 10 different pieces.   The green tea opera dessert was great too.   We each did a sake flight (one sweet fruit sakes and one more main stream sake). That is a great way to taste several sakes.   Our server and food runners were so knowledgable about every aspect of the menu and gave us great recommendations. We will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Get the Zen or premium.  You wont regret it. Fantastic service and food through and through. Everything was delicately created and the staff were very attentive. The price is well worth what you receive as a culinary experience."}
{"text":"This place isn't cheap (~50-75 a person) - I'm all for the $4 hole in the wall dining experience -  but for a special occasion or a bit of a splurge, this place makes for an excellent and delightful choice. I was concerned this would be one of those infuriating restaurants where you overpay for mediocre food falsely dressed up on oversized dishes, but I was proven completely and utterly wrong.   The flavours of the sushi were refined and complex. Presentation was beautiful. Yes, absolutely try the Aburi sushi, which is uniquely seasoned with a different sauce depending on the fish. We also tried the sablefish, which was my personal favourite - delicate, moist and tender, melting in your mouth.   If there's anyone I'm eager to impress, I'm taking them here."}
{"text":"Great upscale sushi and more than sushi spot. Loved the new Aburi Oshi Sushi."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I've been to Miku and all three times have been a great experience. The service is always great, the waitress we had was very friendly and gave some good recommendations.  We went there specifically for the aburi sushi. My friends and I had ordered a sushi platter for one of our friends birthday and that was the first time they had tried Miku's aburi sushi. After that, one of my friends literally said, \"I won't eat sushi anymore unless if it's Miku's\" hahaha  I've had aburi sushi at other restaurants before and they've been pretty good, but Miku probably does top the list. I'm not as excited about the other sushis they offer, but taste wise it's still delicious and very creative with the different ingredients they use and blend together. Each bite is like a blast of flavor in your mouth.  I've also had their steak before... Honestly, not very memorable.  The prices are, needless to say, a little high. A 6 piece dish of the aburi sushi is about $18+ taxes. But if you love fine food I would go only for that even - not necessarily on a daily basis, but as a treat to myself!"}
{"text":"After seeing that a few Yelpers had chosen this restaurant as one of their Winterlicious picks, I had to see for myself what the fuss was about.  Boy was I glad that I did!   This is definitely a first class experience from when you enter and the hostess is so warm and polite and takes your coat, to the servers who come by and explain the menu items if you are not familiar with them to the ambiance and then of course to the actual food.  Honestly I would definitely head back here to try out more items - definitely going to keep my eye out for it during Summerlicious.    Located in Harbourfront this is such a great location - dine, then walk along street and enjoy the views.  Appetizers:  We ordered the Miku Zen appetizers (selection of):  - Aburi Albacore Tuna,   - Ebi Fritter  (beer battered white tiger prawn)  - Beef Tenderloin Skewers with brussel sprouts and potatoes  - Miso Marinated Tofu Salad  Sashimi Plate  - chef selection of 6 pieces and kaisen poke  Absolutely delicious.  Everything was fresh, served on ice to keep to cold.  The beef tenderloins were melt in your mouth delicious - especially with the sauce they used - a sweet and sour soy/wasabi mix.  Mains  - Signature Aburi Sushi Plate (salmon oshi; saba oshi; coal harbor roll; queen quay roll; aburi nigri)  - Maguro Chirashi (negitoro, tuna sashimi; veggies; sushi rice)  The sushi rice was to perfection, the sushi was beautifully presented and the flavours were both strong in presence yet delicate on the palate.  Desserts  - Green Tea Opera (matcha and dark chocalte cake with adzuki bean cream and matcha ice cream) - Chocolate Croissant Bread Pudding (miso salted caramel sauce, Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream)   The Green Tea Opera apparently takes 3 days to make as per our server.  It was melt in your mouth delectable.  It had hints of a ferror rocher chocolate with matcha \"crumbs\" to give it a nice crunch.  I would have licked the plate clean if I were not surrounded by people.  The Bread Pudding was all things sweet from the ice cream, salty from the caramel and just what I imagine heaven tastes like."}
{"text":"Exceptional food and service. It was just the two of us and we ordered lots. I loved everything.  I really like the boxed sushi or anything aburi. The beef carpacio was inhaled in seconds. Their lemon sake (Yuzu Sake) is absolutely delicious - taste like lemonade. See pictures for more details.  Our servers were very knowledgeable and had great suggestions. The Matcha molten lava cake is to die for. My friend went to the washroom and it took alot of self control not to eat the entire thing without him.   It's a very nice place not pretentious. I'd come here to eat with some friends or on a romantic date."}
{"text":"The food: 5 stars   I've been to Miku about 10 times. And I only come here for the aburi sushi, Miku roll, and dessert. Absolutely love their aburi sushi!!! I could literally eat them every day.   Amy favorite dessert is the green tea opera. The matcha lava matched perfectly with the chocolate cake and the ice cream.   The service : 3 stars  Not so friendly and kinda slow."}
{"text":"I came here on Easter Sunday with a girlfriend (a plus because they were open on holiday) and we both really enjoyed our experience!  We both order the Oshi plate, which was 2 pieces of ebi, mackeral and salmon \"torched sushi\". Salmon was def my fave!!!   To satisfy our sweet tooth, we ordered the Green Tea Opera (I liked this better!) and the Fuji Apple Sticky Toffee Pudding. The Opera cake was like an Asian version of Ferrero Richer in cake form - so SO good, a must try! The toffee pudding is just as expected and was really well made.   It was ~$40 per person so its definitely on the higher side. But a great restaurant to come to if you want a special experience :) enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. I'm from Japan and this quality of sushi can be only served at expensive sushi places even in Japan. Seafood was so fresh and taste delicious with perfect sushi rice and soy sauce.  The ambiance of this restaurant is great too."}
{"text":"amazing place loved the tasting menu! this is a very high class and high quality restaurant to have a nice evening!!"}
{"text":"Great for office / business lunch (given its location inside 10 Bay office building) as well as intimate dinner once the business hour bustle dies down.  This place gets busy but nothing else satisfies my sushi cravings like these guys. Price point is definitely on the indulgence side (for lunch pickups specially) - but they have by far the best box pressed sushi I've had so far.  Also, their summerlicious and winterlicious offerings are not to be missed when you exploring to find your hidden gems in the city"}
{"text":"Like a bunch of other Yelpers here, I found this place to be amazing/wonderful/spectacular/all of the above.  It is pricey, but its all listed on their website. Service is top-notch. Ambiance is top-notch. Food is even more top-notch.   I have been to restaurants like JaBistro several times, as well I do enjoy the occasional AYCE around Toronto like Sushi and Bento, and Hockey Sushi. I however, have not been to Japan, but from what I gather from the fine dining restaurants, Miku is definitely at the top of the ladder.   Reservations for Saturday night for me and my boyfriend, as it was his birthday and we got the Shokai (68; zensai, entrée, signature sushi, and dessert) prix fixe.   Zenzai: the dish with the large shrimp. it was assorted raw seafood, some seasoned and all fresh. There was also an oyster shooter, and from the moment I finished my shooter, I realized that I would always have this shot over any alcoholic shot.   Entrée: There was a fish dish, as well as a steak dish. both were delicious, you will not go wrong with anything here.   Signature Sushi: assorted dish of selected sushi by the chef. Everything was perfect: the rice with the fish, the fish itself just draping over the rice, any sauces incorporated into the sushi. I was already stuffed before this, but who could resist more sushi?  Dessert: A nice, light finish with I believe it was a green tea mousse cake. I still had room of course but I was actually fill from this prix fixe.   In addition, we also ordered Kozaemon #6 (sake with hints of chocolate and red bean .. YESSSSSS!!) which went perfectly with our dishes.   ~$230 was our total  including taxes and tips. Take someone special here for a special time for sure, the servers will treat you well,and the food will make you feel even better (plus sake). JaBistro is still my fave place, but Miku definitely comes as a close second. :3"}
{"text":"Got the sushi platter take-out (the sumire one) and holy it was awesome. It had a mix of the aburi sushi and the various rolls that Miku are also known for, beautifully presented (as much as possible in a takeout platter). Had to order this about an hour in advance but that was no big deal.  Considering the Miku roll is $22 a la carte, I think the platter is well worth it, especially as it's a good mix of their best dishes. I normally split this with another person and we always have a few pieces left over."}
{"text":"It's Winterlicious season!!  My boyfriend and I revisited Miku to try out their Winterlicious menu. Miku is now officially my favourite Japanese restaurant in Toronto!! The menu items were the dishes that we liked from our last visit and this was sooo worth it :) The menu was $48pp which includes appetizer, entrée and dessert (3 options to choose from each category). Service was excellent. Our server was very friendly.  DRINKS: * Stoneburn Sauvignon Blanc (mine)  * Underwood Pinot Noir (his)  Appetizer:  * MIKU SIGNATURE ABURI SUSHI SELECTION (5/5) (salmon, ebi, coal harbour roll, queens quay roll, aburi nigiri) We loved each selection of the sushis in this dish.. Our favourite was the scallop and aburi nigiris.. Their rice is so rich in flavour and creamy!! I love it!  Entrée (We ordered different mains):  * KYOTO SAIKYO MISO BAKED SABLE FISH & YUZU BUTTER POACHED HALF ATLANTIC LOBSTER TAIL (5/5) (kale and root vegetables, cauliflower fritter, eggplant purée, quinoa, wasabi chimichurri, tomato chutney) You know you're making the right decision when you order anything fish-related at a Japanese restaurant haha. I ordered the cod last time at Miku. And, of course, this time I'd order fish again. The sable fish was nicely marinated. All pairing dishes were also delish, particularly the cauliflower fritter - it was deep fried and was paired with the eggplant purée - perfect combo!  * PETITE BEEF TENDERLOIN AND PAN SEARED MISO FOIE GRAS (4/5) (tamari soy veal jus, wasabi spinach purée, shiitake mushroom, charred broccoli, baby carrot, garlic arare crumble) My boyfriend ordered this. Loved the pan seared miso foie gras!! It was soo delicious - I wish we had a bigger portion haha. The beef tenderloin is small in portion but I think the amount is just right because the appetizer and dessert will definitely fill you up. Highlights of the side dishes are the shiitake mushrooms and the wasabi spinach purée.   Dessert (We ordered two different desserts):  * GREEN TEA OPERA (4/5) (green tea génoise, matcha butter cream, dark chocolate ganache, adzuki bean cream, hazelnut wafer, matcha ice cream) We ordered this the last time we visited Miku as this was deemed their \"signature dessert\", quoting our previous server haha. Delicious! Love the different textures in the cake. It is both crunchy and soft :)  * CHOCOLATE CROISSANT BREAD PUDDING (5/5) (miso salted caramel sauce,Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream, candied sesame pecan) This was our first time trying this dessert - and omg, I would come back to Miku just to eat this dessert again. The bread pudding had a crunchy crust and a soft breaded interior. It's the best dessert at Miku by farrrr - LOVEE this!! My boyfriend actually ordered this and when I tried a bit of it, I requested to trade desserts with him hahaha. THANK YOUU :D"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the seared sushi here. Their entrees are also quite good. Surprisingly though the best part I thought was actually their dessert."}
{"text":"My cousin took me here for my belated birthday lunch and she has officially ruined normal GTA sushi for me. The crazy 5 star ratings is 100% deserved here and I can't wait to take my boyfriend very soon for a special lunch date. This is how sushi should be done and presented!   The food was visually stunning. They've put a lot of thought and care into the presentation which really makes the entire experience all the better. The staff are very knowledgeable and take the time to explain the specials and dishes to you. I really appreciated that!  We ended up getting the chef's special *Miku Zen* which differs, so you should ask the server first. Ours had a tofu salad (I hate tofu and I ate the whole thing.. didn't taste like tofu at all and well seasoned), beef, fish, and a spin of fish & taro chips. It came with 5 pieces of chef select Aburi (torched) sushi. Each one was delicious and the flavours are already there. You will not be using any soy sauce of wasabi for this sushi meal. We also got the Kale Goma-ae salad which was also very delicious.  Dessert was the best. For a limited time, they're having this mochi dessert that's got condensed milk whip on the inside and a walnut cookie base. The mochi comes with a scoop of black sesame ice cream (my favourite) and drizzle of tarragon honey & various fruits. The mochi is so soft and fluffy it's like eating a cloud!!!!  Everything was well seasoned and balanced and the chefs really take care to present and create each dish so every bite is a whole new experience. The decor is fantastic, service is excellent, and the food was just outstanding. Not an everyday type of lunch spot, but a nice treat once in a while. We all deserve to be mind blown by amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"This is an updated review for a Winterlicious 2018 dinner on January 27th 2018.  I came here with two friends for a Winterlicious dinner -- sadly, the only time slot we could get on a Saturday night was 9:00pm... it was a struggle to stay hungry until then!  I picked the following:  [drink] GRAPEFRUIT BASIL SMASH grapefruit juice, spiced honey, basil, ginger beer  [appetizer] MIKU SIGNATURE ABURI SUSHI SELECTION salmon oshi, ebi oshi, feature roll, red wave roll, aburi nigiri  [main] BACON WRAPPED BEEF TENDERLOIN AND PAN SEARED FOIE GRAS ROUGE confit parisienne potato, spiced brussels sprouts, madeira mirin reduction, hatcho miso glaze  [dessert] GREEN TEA OPERA green tea génoise, matcha buttercream, dark chocolate ganache, azuki bean cream, hazelnut wafer, matcha ice cream  I had last visited Miku in March 2016 and the aburi sushi is just as I remembered: delicious!  The main was very nicely done as well -- the brussel sprouts were absolutely great (I don't have them often).  The tenderloin was just right.  The green tea opera cake seemed a little bit sweeter this time 'round, but it was still good.  Surprisingly the drink I got was pretty sour but it didn't seem too alcoholic.  Overall, a really good meal but pretty expensive ($53 before tax and tip for the meal, the drink was $7).  I'd definitely come back here for more of their aburi sushi..."}
{"text":"Miku is definitely on the same level as Yasu, Kaji, Jabristo, and Zen. Their specalty is Aburi and I must say, it's my new favourite place for Aburi and a holistic dining experience.  I made reservations online, quick and easy. There was a lot of times/dates and selections unlike Yasu and Kaji. I think it's because it's a very large venue with lots of seating. It was my husband's birthday so I wrote a message to put a candle on the dessert.  When we arrived, they asked if they can take our jackets. There are several seating choices - two bar seating areas, high tops, and regular tables. While the sushi chefs do prepare food on one of the bar seating areas, you can't really see them because there is a partition between the seating area and them. A tip I have for the restaurant is to open that up so people can watch the sushi chef prepare the food like Yasu.   The decor is modern with Japanese flare of arts and culture. The service was impeccable. Our server told us if we wanted to do a la carte to order 3 dishes per person. There are three tasting menus and you can mix and match with your guests. You can also order one tasting menu between two people and add a la carte. I like that they had this option so you can have variety.  We ordered the Miku ($110) and Aburi ($150) tasting menu. I have to say that both had different selections of food so it was nice to have this contrast. It was our first time so this was a good way to experience Miku's food.  I also got a flight of fruit wines and my husband for a lemongrass ginger tea.  Tip: Give yourselves at least two hours to dine as every course is spaced out.  Both menus had favourites for me. We shared everything so it's definitely do-able.  First course: Aburi: Foie gras  - lightly seared. Loved this dish Miku: Sashimi - the shrimp was so sweet and fresh. The server will ask if you want the head fried so you can eat it whole. It's lightly battered with panko, delicious, and free of charge! Do it!   Second course: Aburi: Came in this beautiful three layer dish that holds a dish at each layer. Beautiful presentation and dishes! It had a variety of sashimi, wagyu beef, scallop, and oyster. Miku: Again, beautiful presentation, but not as nice as the Aburi. Oyster, scallop, and beef carpaccio.     I have to say I was disappointed with the wagyu. It's prenium beef, but it wasn't as tender and melt in your mouth like i expected. I do have to say, I've tried wagyu at it's finest and this isn't it.   Third course: Cooked dishes Aburi: Wagyu beef and lobster tale - wagyu was nothing to brag about. Miku: Apple bacon wrapped beef tenderloin and veggies - I have to say, I loved the wrapped tenderloin. So good. Better than the wagyu beef! Loved the taste of the food. Lobster tail was a bit salty. Nicely plated.  Fourth course: Aburi and Rolls Miku and Aburi had a mix of aburi. You get more pieces in the Aburi tasting menu. My faves was the Salmon Oshi Sushi - tons of ingredients with amazing flavours. Miku sauce was delicious. You can taste every flavour and it all pops and complements each other. Ebi Oshi Sushi was one my faves as well. Pressed prawn with lime zest. Delicious. Salmon double layer was amazing as well. Torro cut was excellent.  Fifth course: Dessert course Aburi: Jasmine ice cream was amazing. Molten chocolate cake with green tea was amazing. Miku: Opera cake was delicious. Tofu pudding was whipped to perfection. Airy and good tofu falvour.  The flights were sweet. I liked the peach the best. You cannot get this anywhere else, but Miku.  Overall, I really enjoyed this place for the food, decor, service. It lit up all my senses. I think next time, I would order aburi a la carte because i truly thought it was speculator and it's not something you get at every sushi place. I've had aburi at another place in Toronto, but don't remember it being this delicious! The sashimi was good, but I can get that anywhere.  The cost of the tasting menus are pricey so it's definitely a place I would go to for a special occasion or if I was craving Aburi.  Last tip - Wifi is: Mikuguest and password is mikuguest."}
{"text":"Spent a short dinner at Miku before the Raptors game, as the ACC is only a few minutes walk away. The service was attentive and the food is flavourful and delicious as usual!   I ordered the red wave roll (18$), Miku Roll (22$), and Aburi oshi sampler (18$). Filled with sockeye salmon and topped with tobiko and Miku sauce, my personal favourite was the Miku Roll. It doesn't have too much rice compared to the aburi sushi, which is a plus for me.   Great fine dining Japanese restaurant with tasteful modern decor, perfect for a date or special occasion!"}
{"text":"Good service! But the sea food quality can not compare with Miku Vancouver bc the location? Like the sushi!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vancouver I try to get to Miku for the Oshi Salmon, so it made me crazy happy when they opened up this Toronto location. Wow do they get it right, what a big step up from every other sushi shop around. They invest in their people, flying them where they need to be to learn their art, sharing employees across the locations to make sure a new space like Toronto gets the knowledge they need to be great. And the food, simply the best. Not a weak spot on the menu, or the sake selection. A brand new instant favourite, check it out!"}
{"text":"Sushi here are good, with fresh seafood. I loved the green tea dessert a lot. A bit over priced though"}
{"text":"\"This place is so nice!\"  What time we arrived/Wait time? We arrived on a Tuesday evening. We made reservations and got a seat for 2 on the patio right away.   Atmosphere? It is a beautiful open space on the patio. Inside looks very fancy as well. Definitely a higher class sushi place than your regular all you can eat.   Service/Staff? Our server was great! He was very detail oriented and a relational conversationalist. Smiled a lot and was attentive to all our needs. There were 2 girls who came with our food to explain what each dish was made of and all about the ingredients. It was a super cool touch to our experience! Really appreciated that.  Food/Menu? The food was great! We got the torched salmon sushi which was one of their specialties as well as a red wave roll. We also got the chicken and lobster which was a new item on their menu. The torched salmon was AMAZING! It was pressed into a rectangle shape and was so fun to eat. It melted in your mouth and the flavours were so great. Their rolls are made so that you don't need soy sauce so it was so great to see such intentionality with their menu and how they wanted to stick out from the other places. The chicken and sushi were alright - wouldn't order it again. The lobster wasn't marinated very well, but the mushrooms that came with that dish were great! The second roll was yummy as well but definitely stick with their flamed and pressed sushi - it's what their known for!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place once and I absolutely loved it. I have had sushi in Miku- Vancouver thats why wanted to try it in Toronto. Pretty good presentation and delicious food. This is probably the best sushi restaurant in Toronto. Fresh seafood, perfect texture and beautiful experience overall."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Phenomenal service and the food was even better. You really need to try their house special seared sushi."}
{"text":"I had miku this winterlicious on the first day , everything was so good and sooo worth the money , appetizers was huge and had so much variety . And the sashimi and sushi was all so fresh , ofcourse service was suberb. I would rate this as excellent sashimi and sushi. Will come again."}
{"text":"***** Winterlicious 2017 Review *****  Food: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Environment: 4/5 Value: 5/5 ($28 three course lunch)   One of the best meals I've had in Toronto. The seared sushi melts in your mouth. Every course was perfect."}
{"text":"I went here once and had heard great things. I honestly just wasn't that impressed with the sushi for the price. The decor was beautiful, the service great and the sushi was good, don't get me wrong. I just wanted more for $100 per person."}
{"text":"A revisit to Miku has turned me into an aburi fan. I had the Miku Signature Sushi Selection - 10 pcs specialty nigiri, roll and oshi sushi for $36. It was DELICIOUS. My favorite were the two rolls.. the seared top really makes it melt-in-your-mouth. The ingredient combinations (one was asparagus roll) and the special sauces really make this a unique and satisfying sushi set (no soy sauce or additional wasabi required). The pressed salmon and ebi were great as well, but my favorite was the saba (not included in this set but I tried it from my friend's Aburi Oshi Plate). The fish to rice ratio plus seared top is just perfect - this place does pressed sushi right and it is totally different from what you'd get at AYCE. Overall, great ambiance and service for a special sushi night out!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  My first experience was in Vancouver at Miku and was excited when they opened in TO.  Expect to pay premium but I feel you get more than you pay for.  I would rank this a high end Japanese experience.  Asahi draught which is a great japanese beer and a wide range of saki and whiskey selection.  Food and drink is expedient and rarely delayed.  Staff are welcoming and friendly and give great recommendations.    If you like fresh fish and oysters come here.  We had a range of selections from beef carpacio, o Toro sashimi, same and hirame sashimi, and some of their kuburi dishes.  I personally love to start with their spicy edamame.  The only thing I see missing from the menu is hirame (fluke / flat fish).  It is hard to find but a Japanese restaurant at this level should have it available in my opinion.  I continue to recommend to at least try Miku."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and did the tasting menu.  It was very good.  More than enough food.  Definitely coming back.  I definitely didn't expect to be that full.  I felt bad because I had to waste some food because it was just too much.  The sushi OMG the rice was SOOOOOO good.  No complaints for this place.  Everything was very good and exceeded my expectations.  The pricing is definitely worth it.  The atmosphere was very nice, perfect for an anniversary or date.  It's a little pricey when you first look at the menu but when you actually eat and see the food you will realize that its worth it and that there's a reason on why it's priced the way it is.  Very good quality, very good service, made me feel like a valued customer, good variety, VERY good portions.  Loved it here."}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. And wow again! A colleague and I went here for a late dinner yesterday, and were blown away by the excellent service, creative and traditional dishes, and inspired interior design. If you're looking for a cheap sushi place, this isn't it, but if you're looking for a memorable meal, you won't be disappointed. We had miso soup, a variety of sashimi, salmon oshi sushi, saba oshi sushi, the red wave roll, and the miku roll. All were (except the miku roll, which tasted a bit like dry cat food) fantastic, and the red wave roll and bincho toro were...words cannot describe...  For drinks, get the Miyazaki #2. Ginger, citrus, basil, and rum. Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Yes, this place is expensive. However, the food, service, and ambiance (but mainly the food) is well worth it. I especially love how the staff explains each dish to you if you've never had it before.  What we ordered:  Aburi Beef Carpaccio: Salty, thinly sliced beef that goes well with the soft poached egg quarters and pear.  Miku Roll: A must try classic with a great combination of flavors. I would choose the Oshi Sushi plates or the Red Wave Roll over it though because we couldn't remember the Miku Roll after the other two.  Aburi Oshi Plate: Essentially a sampler plate of the three other Oshi Sushi plates (2 pieces of sushi from each of the three other Oshi ones). I recommend trying this to get a nice diversity of tastes before going on to order a full plate of your favorite.  Red Wave Roll: My favorite. It melts in your mouth in a soul-satisfying way (slightly dramatic but you'll agree with me when you try it)."}
{"text":"It's amazing how great the sushi is here. Good atmosphere and it's perfect if you're going to a concert or game at the air Canada centre"}
{"text":"This place is great. That's it. It's that simple. I have not had anything like this before and I think I get around. Weather you are an experienced sushi lover or it's your first time you must experience this place. They have many non sushi dishes for those dates that are not sure about sushi. You can order meat and try some apps with salmon to test your pallet. I brought a friend and they said from now on any other place will be like eating plastic. They have that special touch of the artistic component that makes your meal special. I'll be willing to bet you will be taking out your phone when the food comes. It's simple elegance packed with refreshing flavour. The pricing is very good and the place is elegant and very clean. Soil yourself and give it a try."}
{"text":"Good sushi. Bad value.   The sushi is good. Not great. The fish is largely just alright, though occasionally brilliant. But it's largely just \"better North American sushi\", and there's nothing special about that here other than a bit of cookie cutter flair in the presentation."}
{"text":"Hoooooohmygawsh Miku makes the best sushi OF ALL TIME!!! The melt-in-your-mouth sushi is fresh and aromatic; the flavours and textures are so brilliantly crafted.  This place is sups classy but fret not about being underdressed, clientele is a mix of the business crowd and casual. Came here for an early dinner on Tuesday and we sat in the back - there's lots of natural light next to window and it feels perfectly fancy without putting you out of place.  For two, we shared the calamari ($16), aburi oshi plate ($17), half a red wave roll (yes you can do that! 4 pieces for $9) and half a miku roll (4 pieces for $11.5). We each got a single tiny baby scoop of black sesame ice cream (+1 cracker, 1/2 a raspberry and 1/4 of a teeny tiny strawberry for $4.50, would not recommend doing that again) but the sushi was to die for :p  The calamari came on a round white plate with a stroke of black paint, which we thought was just part of the plate but turned out to be spicy squid ink (it didn't taste like anything to me) but just goes to show how thoughtful and creative they are with the food presentation. My favourite part was actually the 3-4 brussel sprouts which were so very crispy and tasty.  The aburi sushi is truly the most delicious thing I have ever ingested. The salmon is my fave and is topped with a single slice of jalapeno. It's smoky and oily and rich in all the right ways.   My momma had prime rib here once which was solid; everything is good here but I would recommend sticking to the sushi.   Perfect for your next celebration or when you're feeling spendy."}
{"text":"Went here on Mother's Day and was pleasantly surprised--I've been here before for a quick dinner with friends, but at the time I had thought the place was nothing new and overpriced.   We ordered the albacore tartare to start, which was fastastic--Just the perfect amount of seasoning and really fresh fish. We also ordered the classic ebi and salmon Oshi sushi which are always crowd pleasers. While the ebi pressed sushi is better at ja bistro (in my humble opinion), I do think that miku makes the best salmon oshi sushi in town! The last roll we ordered was the soft shell crab fritter roll--so good; highly recommended. But really, the star of the show was the underdog Kaisen Soba Peperoncino... SO FLIPPING FANTASTIC. Would hundo percent go back just for the soba.   Service was alright, nothing special. But please y'all, come and get this soba!"}
{"text":"Expensive but not impressive.  The restaurant certainly tries but it just does not offer great value other than its convenient location for bay street bankers.  For oshizushi rice, less is more..."}
{"text":"This was a great dinner and a great night! The food was delicious but the service was incredible. our server, noticed that my friend had asked me and another to her bridesmaid and so when we ordered dessert she brought out a plate that said Congrats they said yes. It was a very thoughtful gesture.   But on to the food we ended up ordering to share, so we could try as many items as possible.   Spicy Edamame - which wasn't actually as spicy, but a good simple thing to share.   Ebi oshi sushi - which was made from pressed prawn, lime zest and ume sauce. This was a very fresh flavour especially in the aftertaste. The lime came through very clearly. I was in love with the finish.   Red Wave Roll - this had a warmer flavour, a bit spicier but not by a lot. It balanced really well with the Ebi oshi sushi.   Soft shell crab fritter roll - This reminded me more of the typical sushi, the sauce was creamy. The Fritter that came with it was fresh and crispy.   Miku Signature Sushi Selection - I think this was my favourite, simply because it gave us the opportunity to try something from all of the different parts of the menu. All of the fish was very fresh.   We ordered two dessert,  Warm Valrhona Matcha Chocolate Fondant & Passionfruit Mousse & Sake Frozen Yogurt, which came on one plate. It was beautifully decorated and all the pieces and textures made this very fun to eat. I loved all the tiny pieces of fruit. For the main dessert the Matcha Chocolate lava cake, was warm, and we took a bit chocolate oozed out. It game with Jasmine tea ice cream, which was delicious. It balanced out the sweetness of the cake. The Passionfruit Mousse, was light and airy, the flavour was was overwhelmingly good. I could not leave without finishing the last bite. The sake frozen yogurt, wasn't a hit with me (my friend did enjoy it) - but for me it tasted too much like plain frozen yogurt."}
{"text":"Came here for a Winterlicious lunch since all my friends were saying how good Miku was.  Appetizer \"Miku Zen\" was awesome. Honestly, I liked the beef way more than the Jacobs steaks, and the rest of the appetizer (miso soup, ebi shrimp, albacore, tofu salad) was consistently very good.  The main dish was a selection of 7 sushi pieces, every piece was different. To be honest, I like sushi from \"Saku sushi\" more, but it was still good.  For dessert we got green tea Opera. Great again, just a tad small portion.  The service was great too.  The only negative thing I can say is that the water they served had some metallic taste to it, I guess they just serve the water straight from the tap without filtering it."}
{"text":"Four stars is a bit misleading here. The place is bright, modern, and the food is delicious.  The Aburi Prime is a 55$ plate of ten pieces of sushi made from everything from Japanese scallops to waigu beef. It is a must have, yet not completely filling.  There are numerous other options ranging from individual pieces of nigiri to full cold platters of oysters and scallops.  If you love sushi at a higher level, you will love this.  The sushi side of the house is sublime.  Where Miku falls short is in the wine and dessert. The popular green tea chocolate lava cake (in two tries here) was drier and less interesting than it should have been.  The other challenge is the wine list. The wine is premium priced, yet there are no dates associated with the offerings. There can be massive differences in a couple of years in the same wine. Without the dates you have no way of knowing if the wine has any age, was from a warmer Canadian summer (such as '15 and '16), etc. This is unfortunate. Better to stick to the cocktails.  The star here is the seafood. Stick with that (and be prepared to pay) and you will do well."}
{"text":"Time and time again - they outdo themselves with their amazing food/service. Miku is easily my favourite (affordable) sushi restaurant in Toronto.   What won me over here would be the food, albeit the consistently great service they offer. I have loved every single item I've had here:  1) Miku Zen: consists of ebi fritter, aburi albacore tuna sashimi, sablefish, organic tofu salad. The perfect mix in a box. They were very kind in replacing one of the items that contains pork with sablefish and they were fantastic. The organic tofu salad is so generous in portion and very tasty (mind you I do not eat salad:)). Let's just say this box is nothing short of perfection!  2) Sushi plate: consists of salmon oshi, coal harbour roll, red wave roll, prawn aburi nigiri and albacore tuna aburi nigiri. This jus h7stplate is honestly a gift from up there. Salmon oshi is my ultimate favourite. Hands down the best aburi I've had in Toronto! The combination of the Miku sauce and jalapeno is out of this world. I can eat 20 of these, no problem ( and have actually done that :D)  3) on top of the amazing sushi they have, the desserts are also to-die-for! Green Tea Opera is their signature dessert, and it is so for a reason. The dark chocolate ganache apparently takes hours to make and it shows. During summerlicious, I had the chance to try a limited-time bread pudding. I wish this would've been permanent on the menu - perhaps this is what heaven tastes like!  My proximity to this restaurant is probably not the best for me, considering how often I'm there. Obviously, have been and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner, and I loved the food. The red wave sushi roll was spectacular, as well as the Salman and Ebi Oshi! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Toronto by far.  Anyone who says otherwise is just plain wrong.  Worth the hefty bill."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Miku. The moment you're seated you are served, food was prepared fast and we were in and out within 30 minutes during lunch. Every dish was so palatable, you would get a bit of sweet and salty. I highly recommend miku to sushi enthusiasts."}
{"text":"Went on the first day of Winterlicious 2018! We arrived 5 minutes early but they opened exactly at 11:30am. We had a reservation for two that we booked very early in advance and it filled up so quickly that when we asked to change our reservation from 2 people to 3, they didn't even have room for one more chair. When we arrived we told them our reservation and they took our jackets for coat check. We were walked by a hostess to our table next to the window and we're given the menus. The restaurant slowly began to flood. We were ready to order for a while but our server gave us lots of time and explained each meal option. I ordered the Miku Zen, the Aburi Sushi Plate as the entree and the green tea opera as the dessert. Miku zen contains four different dishes including sashimi, salad, an prawn fritter and delicious tender beef and was pretty filling already. The entree included 5 different pieces of sushi and was slightly small but very high quality and delicious. I highly recommend the green tea opera as dessert because al though it's very small, it's also very rich and decadent. All in all, the price is very expensive for lunch ($33+tax and tip) but for delicious and high quality sushi, its a must try!"}
{"text":"I ordered the holiday course  Sashimi: I could actually taste the difference, the meat is firmer than your average fish and provides just the right amount of resistance to your bite Scallop: crispy outer layer is a nice touch Oyster: onion garnish provides a citrus pang to completely erase the usual fishiness Prime rib steak: tender, not chewy so you do not need to work your jaws too much  Aburi from the sushi plate: Rich creamy flavour, really liked this one! I can see why Miku is known for it Pistachio dessert: Although it was just a side to the matcha eclair, it could've been a dessert dish by itself. Love the nutty flavour"}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular. Superb Sushi, amazing appetizers, and fine dining service. I've been here for both dinner and lunch, and have found the experience fantastic for a group from 5-10. Truly appreciative of the incredibly accommodating staff, the relaxed atmosphere and the exceptionally good Sushi."}
{"text":"Miku is everything I expected it to be and more. The service was phenomenal. Food was some of the best sushi I have ever experienced.   Firstly, AJ the server, was the simple the best. Make sure you get him if you decide to visit Miku. He was attentive, polite, kind and did his job and more. I cannot praise him enough.  The Miku roll, scallops and green tea desserts were the highlights of my meal. I highly recommend those choices! The only knock against Miku is that its expensive. Despite that, this is a great resto for a special occasion. Highly recommend and I would come back! 5 stars *****"}
{"text":"Pricy and some item had no favour.  Good experience overall You might consider going to all you can eat. Yes the quality is not as good but fushimi is not that far a drive from this location"}
{"text":"I came back to Miku for dinner after just coming to this restaurant only 11 days earlier for lunch. Together the group of 6 of us came to the restaurant, was warmly greeted by the staff, and had coat check service as well. We sat at the higher tables this time, and it was a table for 6 people, which was just perfect. I liked that the size of the tables were not too big and it was definitely cozy enough for 6 people to be able to talk together as group.   This time I had to introduce some of the foods I tried last time of course to see if they enjoyed it as well. We ordered salmon and mackerel oshi sushi (pressed), miku roll, soft shall crab roll, toro and green onion maki, and Kaisen Soba Pepperoncino.   The Kaisen Soba Pepperoncino came first: the soba noodles were delicious! the seafood was also very fresh, there was a mix of clam, mussel, shrimp, scallop, squid and there were also some vegetables mixed into it. the sauce for the soba noodles was amazing! really could taste the soy and sesame, but not sure what else is in there :) it was also great for sharing, it was a big enough plate that everyone got at least 2 or 3 bites of the soba noodles  with a variety of seafood.  Oshi sushi: - both mackerel and salmon were very well liked by my friends and everyone really enjoyed the sushi. We actually went back and ordered a second order of the salmon one because it was just so delicious. They all liked how the oils of the fish were melted into the rice of the pressed sushi. SO GOOD.  Miku roll: - did not disappoint, once again it was just done so well and i love the way they blowtorch their rolls and sushi. Again, all of my friends really enjoyed and complimented on the roll. The taste of this roll is definitely quite complex with all the flavours, but the best part is that they all go so well together. All my friends really enjoyed the complexity and balance of the flavours!  Soft shell crab roll: - tried this one for the first time. I really liked it! i enjoyed the batter of the soft shell crab and i like how it came with some salmon embedded, best of all there were two extra pieces served on the side for those who just really want the crunchy soft shell crab :) THe only catch was it came with 5 pieces, so it wasn't quite enough for everyone to try a piece.   Now came desserts. This time i made sure I had room for it lol! My fiance ordered the green tea opera and I ordered the matcha chocolate fondant. I would have to say, their desserts are the BOMB! and the reason why i increased my rating to 5 stars. Their desserts without a doubt were amazing and some of the best I've ever had in the city. I LOVE lava cake, and one of my biggest pet peeves is how they always screw them up! it'/s always too well cooked. But Miku with this matcha chocolate fondant of a choclate lava cake with matcha powder and a matcha chocolate ganache, it was to die for! If you love lava chocolate cake, you WILL love this dessert. it was cooked perfectly. when i broke the cake's outside layer the lava just oozed out naturally, and just mixing that together with the cake and eating it. OMG. They also had these strawberry compote with grade a matcha powder (and you can actually taste how good the quality is as you eat the powder with the strawberry and also some jelly on the side. The jasmine tea ice-cream that came with the cake as well was really really well done! I was able to taste the jasmine tea very well in that ice-cream, and ti was the perfect density of taste, not too heavy, but just enough that you can really enjoy the tea flavour in the ice-cream.  Their matcha green tea ice cream is probably the best I've ever had in all my years of green tea ice-cream. Because of the powder they use, the flavour is actually a bit different from what you normally would get from grocery stores or other restaurants. The quality makes a difference! Also the green tea opera is a very delicate dessert that takes like 3 days to put geother. For those who likes layered cakes, napoleon cakes, or even choclate bars like coffee crisp, would really like this matcha opera cake. they definitely use a lot of matcha powder into the cake and the result is layers of delicateness mixed with deliciousness. But being a lover of lava cake, my preference was towards the fondant. But my fiance LOVED the matcha opera cake and the ice-cream.  ANyway topped off with an amazing server by the name of Angel also made the evening super fun for all of us :) Thank you for a wonderful night of good quality food and service. Definitely one of the greatest dining experiences I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I live across the street from Miku. I've had take out from there a few times, which was good. This past week I decided to give Miku a sit-down try.  We ordered a sashimi platter for 2. Oddly, there were 4 kinds of tuna on there out of say, 6 varieties of fish. Talk about lack of diversity! From my experience, their hamachi and their shrimp are always very good. Thumbs up to the crispy, deep fried shrimp head as well. I've had better sashimi elsewhere though to be honest.  We also ordered a dish of foie gras with seared albacore tuna. 2 things that would make anyone say 'yes, please.' I'd order this dish again. The cumin in the couscous was a bit out of place for me though. Fusion, I guess.  Our server was a bit blasé. I'd be too if I was serving a dining room full of just water drinkers."}
{"text":"Amazing resturant and very delicious. Always reserve a seat. Its always busy.  Liron Priborkin"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were at Harbourfront today.  We randomly picked Miku for lunch based on walking distance and Yelp rating.  We didn't know a thing about Miku prior to today (no lies).  This casual encounter gave us the best non-Omakase Japanese food experience in Toronto to-date.  It was so good that this review is uncharacteristically short.  Simply put, Miku painstakingly engineers a culinary experience down to the smallest detail.  It is so near perfection that whatever flaws I have noticed are minute.    The traditional, aburi (flame seared) and aburi oshi (flame seared & pressed) sushi were made of ingredients of finest quality.  They were delicious, fresh, visually beautiful.  All the pieces were expertly made technically.  The flavours were complex, intense yet well balanced.  The sushi rice was a star in its own right.  For cooked food, the Sablefish was meaty and expertly pan seared.  Its flavouring was delicate to highlight the natural sweetness of the fish.  The Valrhona Matcha Chocolate Fondant dessert was pure perfection.  The miso soup was done right.  Even the tea was made of high quality tea leaves, and the temperature was just right for consumption.  We enjoyed the food very much, despite the fact the meal was more expensive than usual."}
{"text":"I was so excited to check out Miku for Winterlicious this year, and it truly did not disappoint. Although the items on the menu vary from the original Vancouver location, Miku Toronto does not lack in quality or class.  For the appetizer, the Miku Signature Aburi Sushi Selection came with my 2 favourite flame seared aburi pieces - Aburi Salmon and Ebi Oshi Sushi.   For the entree I got the Miso Baked Sable Fish & Yuzu Butter Lobster Tail which came with 3 different sauces that made each bite packed with a different assortment of flavours. I highly recommend it.   The Green Tea Opera for dessert was nice but got a tad bit too rich after a few bites.   Our waiter was very attentive, polite, and dutifully introduced each dish as he served it to us. I had a very good time dining at Miku. I always do."}
{"text":"Food good but service leaves a lot to be desired.  Booked it for my wife's Birthday. Asked to sit on patio but on a cool summer night asked to have heater on the .. heater ran out of prepane 1/2 way through dinner. They did nothing .   5:45 pm sunday dinner Reservation and could not get drinks served with meal order drinks came after we had Finished food. $24 for a glass of wine that you can't get served with dinner ?    $150 for dinner for 2 food Was 4.5 out of 5 overal dinner experience 2 out of 5.  This early in the evening there is there is no \" we were busy\" excuse .   They should try have dinner at Nota Bene if they would like to experience a 5 star dinning experience.   They offered a free $11 drink after we were all done, but the opportunity for a good dinning experience was gone by then."}
{"text":"Miku's good, though overhyped.  Food: Their food is good, though not amazing. Their fish is fresh and I would recommend their sashimi platters. The aburi/oshi isn't as good as other places in Toronto (JaBistro), and so I wouldn't recommend getting it at Miku. They have inventive dishes and appetizers that are fun to try.  Ambiance: It's a modern and intimate vibe at Miku - perfect for dates. They plate their food really well and it adds to the ambiance of the restaurant. There's lots of seating and the location is near the Harbourfront.  Overall I'd recommend Miku if you want good sashimi, though there's better restaurants in Toronto at the same price point."}
{"text":"Amazing food, this is currently my favorite go-to restaurant in Toronto. The sushi is always prepared so well i get excited every time I go.  The staff are great too, I had an issue and they handled it so well.   My most recommended dishes: - Salmon Oshi - Ebi Oshi - O toro nigiri - Avocado nigiri"}
{"text":"I came here expecting creativity. Sushi I've never experienced before. And yes, that's what I got. I visited this place to celebrate my birthday with friends and wasn't disappointed by the food, or the service. Yes, it's pricey. Yes, there's a hint of superiority. Yes, you'll need reservations. Yes, you should prepare to be adventurous and to taste flavour combos you've most likely never had before. Don't expect traditional, straightlaced sushi. This is avante-garde sushi, and we were very happy with most of our meal.  First, the service. Thanks to Hien for such attentiveness, friendliness, and efficiency. One of us had to head out earlier and Hien made sure he figured out the bills in record time, in addition to getting our food out faster than normal. It really makes a difference when your server actually cares, and he made this birthday experience a great one.  Second, the food. We ordered a couple of appetizers and a variety of rolls. I'll note that, if there's one part of the meal that was just average, it was the appetizers. The seared scallops were okay, but didn't thrill me. The tuna tartare was fine and very fresh, but the flavours didn't wow me. The sushi, on the other hand, contained bursts of flavour. This is where they excel. The Salmon Oshi Sushi was my absolute FAVOURITE. The tops were sweetly seared, the sauces were unbelievable. The Miku Roll was also quite delicious. The fish was incredibly fresh, and the flavour profiles featured such well-envisioned complexities that completely wowed us. Everything was so carefully prepared, we wouldn't hesitate to come back for more of this!  Overall, Miku is innovative, not traditional. It aims to give you a unique experience in a classy, sophisticated setting. It's great for dates, for small dinners, even large group gatherings (it's a pretty big space). Upscale feel, and a good variety to the menu. It's pricey, but, for the most part, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The quality is good in Miku however I would argue to say that the price you pay for is more for the environment than anything else. Understandably that rent is more expensive in the downtown area unfortunately. Excellent place to take for dates and good sushi.   Portions for sushi are okay - for a hefty price I would say. I went during my winterlicious times and even then the prices were already on the higher end."}
{"text":"** Review for Winterlicious $28 Lunch **  This is by far the best -licious event I've tried, because I was blown away by not only the amazing taste of my food, but how much value I got through this Winterlicious deal.   I knew when I saw the line-up for Winterlicious that I was going to give Miku a try so I made my reservation on OpenTable.com on the day when the reservations start. Apparently the maximum you can book is for table for 4 on OpenTable, but we were able to get another table for 2, so we just called them to combine both reservations. Later on we realized that there were seats available for walk-in customers for lunch, but obviously the seats weren't as good.   Environment: Miku is located inside of an office building at Bay/Queens Quay, which you can take the subway to Union station and walk here or drive and park at the basement of the building. Unfortunately, we were informed that Miku will not reimburse the parking fee.  The interior of the restaurant was spacious, beautiful decorated, and very classy. It definitely gave out a high-end vibe but not too formal. They provide coat checks at the door. We were seated at a window seat with comfy couches and bright natural light to take lots of good photos. So yeah, it is still highly recommended to get reservations so you get the best seats.  There was a open chef's table on the outside where you can see them preparing the sashimi, and near the door you can look into the open kitchen where they prepare the majority of the food.  Food: For $28 you get a really good deal for the meal considering how expensive everything is normally (yes we totally compared prices when we were shopping around Winterlicious restaurants). Heck, even the freaking miso soup would set you back $4 but we got it for free.  The most popular Winterlicious lunch combo was: Miku Zen + Aburi Sushi + Green Tea Opera, but I decided to get give the Sashimi a try.  Before we were served our appetizer, we received our free miso soup, which tasted super salty, but my friend told us that this is how people in Japan like their miso...so I guess it's authentic? Our appetizers came out beautifully and I was happy with how quickly the food came out. The Miku Zen was the better value because you get 4 different dishes to try but I think the Sashimi Plate had a better presentation and all of the fish tasted fresh. There were 2 types of soy sauce to dip the Sashimi in, one sweeter and another with stronger flavour, I prefer the sweeter soy sauce more.  We all got the Aburi Sushi Plate and it was another good looking plate of food, so more picture time!! Between the 6 different pieces of sushi that we got, my favourite were the Salmon Ochi, Saba Ochi, and the Shrimp Nigiri. Even though 6 pieces didn't look like much, but I ended up pretty full after I finished everything. We also had the regular lunch menu with us and this Aburi Sushi Plate would have costed around $17 normally.  Lastly, we all chose the Green Tea Opera for dessert. The layered cake came with a small scoop is green tea ice cream. The ice cream was definitely above your average store bought green tea ice creams as it had stronger matcha flavour and had a much thicker and smoother texture. The layered cake was made with layers of green tea wafer, red bean paste, chocolate mousse, and topped with a layer of green tea gloss. It tasted so good that I didn't want the tasting experience to end. This would cost you $14 normally, which further proves how the Winterlicious deal is such a good value.   Service:  Our server Hein was amazing. He was very patient and attentive, and he was super knowledgeable of each of the dishes. He came to check up on us about 10 times in total and his quality of service was not compromised even though we all ordered from the cheaper Winterlicious menu. Our table was really satisfied with his service, Hein totally deserves the praises and the great tips"}
{"text":"From the service to the food to the decor, this is probably one of the best experiences I've had for sushi in Toronto so far. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and very helpful in recommending delicious dishes! I ordered the premium Sushi plate which came with some Maki rolls and their famous torched sushi which was incredible! I was feeling hungry after that so I orderd another Miku rule which was a salmon, crab, cucumber and uni, rolled in tobiko and was topped with their special sauce, which was phenomenal! I ended things off with a delicious mochi and berry couli dessert! The mochi was on a cookie and cream bed...holy shitballs it was good!   A little pricey for lunch, but well worth it if you're in the area.  Overall 5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Taste: 4 Service: 5 Value: 1 Presentation: 5 Overall: 3.9 rounded down to 4  Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. Today we are trying the special here. It has a little bit of all of their signature dishes. Let's dive right into the review.  Wow does the food look fancy. The food was placed in small independent bowls and they fit nicely on a wooden plate. A lot of my co-workers say that this place has one of the best a la carte in Toronto and I can agree. There were some pieces of fish that I didn't enjoy but I generally enjoyed it. I especially like the fried shrimp but they only give 1 :(  Great service at this restaurant. The place itself looked very classy and everybody there was well dressed, while I was proudly enjoying my meal in my jeans and sweater on the other hand.  In terms of value, I paid around 40 dollars for the meal. Just to warn you beforehand, if you are a short average looking male, this meal will definitely not fill you up. I went during lunch time too so I can't begin to imagine how much this would cost at dinner.  Overall, the food here is a good try but I don't see myself coming back. The amount of food I recieved was way too little for the amount that I paid for. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!"}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Location: 4/5  Overall a big thumbs up from me. The place felt spacious with it's high ceilings and lovely modern interior as well as a wonderfully polite staff.   The Nakano Ume plum wine is BOMB. It was my first time trying plum wine and I was hooked. It tastes like apple cider, but without the carbonation and cloying sweetness that some ciders have.   Starter: Aburi Sashimi Selection  Since Miku is known for their Aburi, we had to try a couple. It was yummy, but I preferred the sushi that came with the sushi selection. In comparison I also enjoyed the Aburi at Ja Bistro better.   Main #1:  Miku Signature Sushi Selection  We ordered the selection to try out the best of what Miku had to offer and it didn't disappoint. The platter had a selection of both classic pieces as well as a couple different takes on sushi. The most memorable was an aburi spicy salmon with jalapeno on top and salmon inside the rice as well. Another piece featured some kind of saffron citrus flavour explosion.   Main #2: Pork belly with Seared Sweetbreads Highly recommend this dish! The pork belly is fatty, flavourful, tender, and roasted to perfection. It's also important to note that sweatbreads are, in fact, not breads at all but pork pancreas. Despite the misleading name, followed by the sobering explanation, this stuff is pretty good.   Dessert: Miso-salted caramel ice cream Unique touch with the miso salted flavour and really balanced out the sweetness of the caramel. A+ on this dessert."}
{"text":"Fav sushi restaurant for oburi oshi sushi!!! Great service and nice ambience. It's a must stop for when I'm in !! The molten cake is very delicious. Sushi is very fresh as well"}
{"text":"Okay so this wonderful restaurant needs more than five stars. I've NEVER been treated as well as the staff has treated me. Janson the bartender was the nicest bartender even and so informative. All the food I ordered was explained in exquisite detail. The food was amazing!!!!  I had the octopus, scallops, and the soft shelled crab sushi.  I have never had better. Every time I'm here in Toronto I Will be stopping here to get a fantastic meal. Please stop and eat here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Terrific sushi experience. Everything is very well presented using quality, fresh ingredients. A lot of the kitchen staff are Japanese or were trained in Japan, bolstering the authenticity of the experience. It's a more modern take on sushi. While the standard sashimi is superior to most other places, try the seared/torched varieties for something a bit more unique. Very interesting desserts are offered as well. We decided just to try the ice creams and found the flavours to be nice and light.  When entering the restaurant, I still found that I was greeted by the kitchen staff with a nice welcome, which is a neat touch reminiscent of Japan itself. It is toned down a bit however compared to your izakayas, possibly just to be more considerate of North American expectations and the general vibe/ambience of the restaurant. In any case, the service was excellent and the wait staff are well-trained and knowledgeable on the menu, offering to explain everything that is plated in front of you. Interior of the restaurant is very tastefully designed.  You can come in at lunch for less than $30 (before taxes+tip) per person. It's decent value in my opinion, but should nonetheless be reserved for more special occasions."}
{"text":"Miku offers quality sushi but be prepared to empty your wallet. I ordered the Miku signature sushi plate and while it tasted amazing, it was 10 pieces of sushi that costs $40+. My friends also got the Shokai which is a 4 to 5 course meal which was a minimum of $80. While pricey, the meal is pretty value with the amount of food you get.   The service here was amazing, the interior is well designed, and the entrance of the place requires you to go inside the building and not enter from the outside. In the end, I recommend trying this place out especially if it is for a date. Good luck! :)"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and we chose the Miku tasting menu.  Although it is listed under Kaiseki on their menu, the dishes doesn't really represent the tradition of kaiseki.  The first dish was a small seafood platter with shrimp, oyster and clams.  It came in a sphere banto box like.  It was very nicely presented dish.  The next dish was a clam tomato soup which was really filling.  Next we had a prime rib dish which was very good as well but too much sauces.  This one is rather more western taste than japanese.  Next dish, was the aburi sushi sampler which is to me the best of the night.  Our dessert was the green tea opera which was another amazing dish.  Overall it is a great place but not sure about the kaiseki part of it.  The Aburi menu which we wanted to try needs to be order 72hrs in advance and on top of that providing lots of personal information which i rather not opt to do."}
{"text":"Oh my. This place is spectacular. The service is impeccable, and the sushi, well, I almost have no words. Every piece is delectably crafted and a work of art. I ordered the fixed price three course selection and every bit was a joy. Every piece was expertly described by the server and   best savored slowly. I don't typically cleanse my palette with ginger between bites, but here also I enjoyed delaying the moments between bites, prolonging the expectation of the next bite. If only I were able to share my experience with others in my family. Would be worth taking everyone on a long flight to Toronto to give them the chance. Yum."}
{"text":"Have been to Miku for 3 times now for over a year .  I would say that  Miku is probably the best Japanese resto in Toronto.  Service was impeccable & consistent, and so was the food.  Price point considers middle to middle high end.  Would highly highly recommend anyone to try it."}
{"text":"This has become our favourite restaurant in Toronto. I hate the term but this really is a world class place. The attention to detail and the customer service is exemplary. We have become regulars so we are treated like long lost friends when we dine there. We always ask the head sushi chef to come up with something. The resultant sushi is an art work in itself and the flavours are complex so that we end up savouring each mouthful. We almost always have the seaweed salad to start. The house special Aburi Ginjo sake is the perfect accompaniment. And to cap it off their desserts from their own pastry chef are a treat."}
{"text":"We (group of 10) celebrated my husband's 40th birthday at Miku and I must say, choosing Miku for this celebration was a great choice for our group.  I don't think I need to go into details of our meal as other reviewers have done a fantastic job describing Miku's offerings.    We opted for a set menu so we could just enjoy each others company while partaking in some fantastic food and Miku really delivered.  We were seated in a separate section of the restaurant so it almost felt like being in a private room.  The servers were intelligent, helpful and gracious all evening and took care of us very well.    The food was excellent, restaurant was comfortable and the laughters shared with good friends made this a fantastic evening.  I would come back to try Miku again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to friends and family."}
{"text":"My first time in Miku. Had low expectations because it was a Winterlicious event but I was proven wrong. Seems like they put just as much effort with this menu as they do with their regular a la carte. Hands down my favourite Winterlicious experience. Everything was delicious from start to finish. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, the croissant bread pudding I had for dessert almost brought serious tears to my eyes - it was cold and warm, crunchy and rich - full of interesting flavours without being overwhelming. Really well thought out. My appreciation to the ????? who came up with this dish!"}
{"text":"Love the dessert and selection of food! That said, aburi sushi is not as good as jabistro."}
{"text":"Went to Miku during Winterlicious, however when we looked at the Winterlicious menu (and around at other people's plates) it wasn't as appealing to us as the regular menu since we were craving sushi and the menu included items such as beef tenderloin and mushroom ragout. The serving sizes also looked a bit small.   Instead we ordered from the regular menu: 1 Miku signature sushi selection plate each and a salmon oshi sushi to share. Forgot to ask the server to put the wasabi on the side, as neither of us like wasabi...but man that sushi was so good even the wasabi tasted like heaven to us. It was a special occasion so we ordered a couple of desserts, and they were both amazing too. I don't think Miku can do any wrong. We ended up spending just a bit more than what we would have with the Winterlicious menu, however definitely enjoyed it more.   100% would recommend. It is on the (way) pricier side, so more of a special occasion sort of place. However, you definitely get what you pay for here and won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you have never tried Aburi sushi aka torched sushi, this is the place to try. On the recommendation of several friends, my fiancé and I came here for dinner and boy it did not disappoint. There are many times on the menu to choose from and we did splurge.   We started off with the Kaiso Seaweed Salad and the Aburi sashimi selection. The candied sockeye salmon stood out in the salad and the garlic tomato ponzu vinaigrette did not overpower. The aburi sashimi was great as well as you get 2 pieces each of 4 different sashimi. There is something about the fish being flame seared that adds another dimension of umami and you do not need to add any soy sauce as each piece is brushed with Miku's signature sauces.   In lieu of entrees, we decided to order 2 different rolls - the Miku roll and the Soft Shell Crab fritter roll in addition to an order of salmon oshi sushi and Miku's signature sushi selection plate. The rolls were so flavourful with the Miku roll consisting of sockeye salmon, crab and unit topped with their signature sauce and even the soft shell crab roll had scallops and salmon yet they did not skimp on the soft shell crab.   The signature sushi plate was great to order especially since it was our first visit and they provide 10 mixed pieces of nigiri, roll and oshi sushi, just a little bit of everything. The star of the dishes was by far the salmon oshi sushi. Sockeye salmon flame seared with jalapeños and Miku sauce melted in your mouth and was delicious. I would definitely order 2 plates of this the next time we visit. Lastly, we finished off with the green tea opera, which was the perfect ending to the night, their matcha ice cream was outstanding.   The service was great and our server carefully explained each dish as it was brought out and constantly refilled our drinks and checked up on us. By far one of our favourite restaurants and eagerly awaiting our return."}
{"text":"I planned a birthday party here for a Saturday night and Olivia, the event planner, was absolutely amazing and accommodating to our requests. We were given the Mizumi room which was perfect for the size of our party and we were able to enjoy the basketball game during dinner from the TV in the wall. All our guests loved the dishes they ordered. The food is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Probably the best Japanese food I've ever had in Toronto. Our primary server Sam was amazing and very attentive. It is more expensive compared to other Japanese restaurants but the food and service at Miku are stellar so it's worth the price! We will definitely return again to try out all the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Brought the family here and the experience was top notch.  We had the seaweed salad, coal harbour platter, some aburi sushi plates, crab fritter roll, garden roll and dessert.   Aburi sushi was the highlight hands down. It's pressed sushi that is flavoured and cooked with a blowtorch. Great for people who don't eat raw.   On the other hand, I wasn't thrilled with the value of the coal harbour platter. If you want to sample a few things I guess it's a decent option but you may be able to get more bang for your buck elsewhere on the menu.   Also, the desserts are not an after-thought at this place so don't miss. We shared the deconstructed pina colada and the chocolate ganache cake. Both are highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has an excellent clean crisp vibe. For the steep price tag, I would say it's definitely worth it. You really do get what what you pay for at Miku. It has quality sushi with impeccable taste! The flavours all meld together and will melt in your mouth. The salmon Oshi sushi is one of the best sushis on the menu and it's prepared using a flame seared technique. For dessert we had the green tea opera and the Valrohna matcha chocolate fondant. Both were delectable!  This was by far the best sushi I have tried in my life and I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Miku sure has a lot of positive reviews but I can't help but agree with most of them.   It gets busy here, I booked on OpenTable and I received a call the next day to confirm the reservation. I was able to get an earlier time not offered on OpenTable so that's a plus.   First off, the decor here is very pretty and welcoming. Very spacious and clean washrooms as well - yes clean washrooms are important too!   After reviewing the menu, my friend and I decided on the following: Calamari, Kaisen Soba Peperoncino, Miku Roll, Aburi Oshi Plate, Green Tea Opera and Ichigo Mochi Dome.   Almost everything we ordered we enjoyed. Everything tasted fresh and made to order. The food here is overflowing with different flavours although some tasted too \"salty\".   Calamari - It was good but nothing outstanding. I felt the sauce was overpowering and too salty for my personal preference.   Kaisen Soba - This was one of my favourites! You have the choice of mild or spicy, of course I chose spicy and the combination of the ingredients made this an outstanding dish.   Miku Roll - Fresh and quite good but can't be compared to the Aburi Oshi Plate.   Aburi Oshi Plate - Amazing! Definitely just try this and this is the best way to try a bit of everything. Just the right amount of flavours but if I had anymore I would think it's too salty.   Green Tea Opera - Visually appealing but overly sweet for both my friend and I. The ice cream was delicious but this is definitely for those who enjoy their desserts very sweet.   Ichigo Mochi Dome - Delicious! Perfect combination of the texture of the Mochi with the berries and condensed milk. This dessert was a winner!   Overall, Miku is a great place to dine with friends, family and anyone who enjoys an overwhelming but delicious flavours. Best to share the dishes here to have the best experience. I wouldn't mind coming back to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"Everything was nicely presented and taste great! The waitress was extremly nice and friendly. The aburi sushi is good for sure. My other favorite item is the sashimi, which comes with a tasty sauce. Finally, make sure to try the sake froyo and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Extremely good service and delicious food. They really go out of their way to make sure you get what you want. Its pricey but totally worth the experience."}
{"text":"High marks for elegant yet not snobby ambiance. Octopus: delicious. Miku roll: pretty good (I'm not a big roll fan). Sesame edamame: meh. Now for the star... Aburi style sushi: Wow. Each bite was so well balanced, with the condiments complimenting the fish perfectly. The charcoal sear on the fish imparts such a delicate distinct flavor. This LA girl will totally brave the cold Toronto weather for the Aburi sushi again. Last but not least, the matcha chocolate dessert was good as well, not too sweet but kinda busy with tons of components. The jasmine green tea ice was very refreshing."}
{"text":"Pricy but the sushi and service is definitely worth it. Saki selection is excellent. Perfect choice for a business lunch."}
{"text":"My wife and I would like to thank Chanelle for her dedication to the customers and for her outstanding service. Chanelle is a restaurant manager and she truly cares about each customer's experience. She has a very personal touch in managing Miku.  We also thank the entire Miku team for making our each visit to Miku Toronto truly special! In my humble opinion, Miku is by far the best Japanese seafood restaurant in Toronto. The quality of any food item we have ever ordered was exceptionally good! The service is always outstanding! My wife and I have been loyal customers since Miku opened in Toronto in 2015, I believe, with multiple visits in the past and to come. And I apologize for not providing my feedback earlier.   Overall, each our Miku visit is a culinary adventure, the seafood is always freshest and highest quality. We are so happy that we have got Miku in Toronto and we don't have to travel to Van City each time we desire the quality seafood.  I highly recommend Miku to all the seafood lovers, couple for romantic dinners, business lunches, and families with kids as they have lots of space!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Miku ever since I saw and read about the resturant during Winterlicious and after having a bad experience at Shoshin from when my bf took me, I wanted to find a spot which I wanted to go to and impress him with my skills of finding a good sushi spot!!   After looking through the menu, my bf and I decided to go for the Sakura Aburi Prime Set menu plus sake pairing. The kitchen was also super sweet in giving us a complementary glass of sakura sparkling wine and octopus tartare as our amuse. The set menu itself was beautifully presented as well as did not fall short on taste. Majority of the time our servers were interactive and very well trained in presenting/introducing our dishes to us. However our main server simply did not make the cut in being professional.   However the food spoke volumes! The highlight of the menu for me was the Miso Baked Sablefish that was part of the kaiseki trio. The fish was beautifully cooked and tender, my bf and I both enjoyed every bite as it flaked beautifully when we cut our fork through it. The Aburi sushi was to die for. We both agree that we'd come back just for the sushi! Lastly, the dessert ended our meal beautifully, the green tea pannacotta and mint ice cream was a light medley of flavors that came together wonderfully.   Overall the food I'd rate: 4.5 Service I'd rate: 4 (majority of the servers were professional and eloquent, except for one) Resturant ambiance/setting: 3 (the restaurant's setting is a bit confusing in my opinion as it's sectioned off to many areas with a chef's table, bar area, and dining area. My bf and I thought that we'd be seated at the chef's table as we made a reservation and asked to be seated there.)"}
{"text":"Had wanted to try this place for awhile and finally came by for a date night when I was downtown. First thing I noticed was the large space. This place is perfect for groups but intimate enough for small gatherings and dates.  Ambience was nice and warm.   We didn't know what to get so we ordered a random arrangement of deliciousness. The sashimi platter was very good. I loved the hamachi! Super tasty! The platter of oysters with salmon ceviche, scallop sashimi, and kale salad was also delicious. And of course the aburi sushi is very good, which is what they are known for. We also tried the miku roll which had an interesting smokey flavour. Lastly, for dessert we had the green tea opera cake and the deconstructed pina colada. The first one I wasn't really a fan of the bitter chocolate layer and the crunchy hazelnut wafers. Really wanted just the green tea red bean combo. The second dessert was very pretty and just bursting with tropical flavour! Loved it!"}
{"text":"I wish I could have loved this experience a lot more but the service really dragged down the evening. I was there for a celebration with friends on the day after the Grand Opening. Let's just dive right into the review.  Staff: On the day of the dinner, we arrived and they located my reservation and took us to our seats. The entire kitchen and staff all greeted us at once. It was nice, but I can see it getting tiresome if you sat closer to the kitchen for dinner. Unfortunately the service was really slow. Our dining experience took nearly 4 hours and many of us did not want it to be that long. We ordered from many different items but they came out at different stages because they were considered different courses. But the only problem is it seemed that there were maybe over 10 phases of food and because of that there were many times one of my friends had a dish, while the rest of us didn't and we were forced to watch them finish their dish before the next one came out. The servers often didn't know what they were serving and would need to check numerous times. The staff also seemed to lack attentiveness and often left certain plates that should've been taken away a long time ago, or they even took away plates that we were still working on. The worst part was that the bill itself also took over half and hour to come after we had asked for the check. Overall, the service was deplorable.  Ambience: The dining experience was very calm and comfortable. Noise levels were low even though we were near other tables. The restaurant itself was typical of the high end restaurants with the sleek design and lot of tiles and glass. Everything was very clean and properly presented, and I felt comfortable during the entire meal. Plenty of space but still close enough to everyone to comfortable converse with my friends.  Food: I will say that the cooked food was the best part of the food experience. I had the Smoked Soy Grilled Octopus to start and it was garnished nicely and grilled to perfection. Unfortunately, the wasabi aioli was slightly overpowering for me personally. I then had the Soft Shell Crab Fritter Roll and the Aburi Sushi Sampler. Sometimes, I find sashimi to be too fishy, especially since we aren't located near any of the coasts. The Aburi-style sushi takes a blowtorch and lightly cooks the top-side of the sushi making it for a unique and extremely tasty experience. The Soft Shell crab was absolutely melt in your mouth amazing and I highly recommend it for anyone trying items off the menu. My friends had also ordered the Aburi Beef Carpaccio, the Miku Signature Bouillabaisse, the Miku Waterfront Platter, and various sashimi and sushi dishes as well. Unfortunately after sampling the other dishes, I had discovered that the regular clams and mussels and those dishes with uncooked (non-Aburi style) dishes were nothing special compared to other establishments that we've been before. The desserts were a hit with most people.  Overall the service really pulled down the performance of the restaurant. However, the food was strong enough to make up for the front end shortcomings."}
{"text":"It brings me great joy, in my 200th review, to finally say that I've at last found a fantastic omakase place in Toronto.  We went last week, and because we're entering holiday season (yayyy Christmas!), we got to try their holiday omakase menu.   Course 1: Seafood platter This seafood platter came in a delectable boat that consisted of oyster, aburi sashimi, a prawn cocktail, oyster shooter, mussels, scallop, and poke.  It was DELICIOUS.  Everything that entered my mouth DANCED in flavours.  The fish was so sweet and rich in flavour.  It was a good balance and a perfect way to set the mood for a really wonderful night to come.   Course 2: Entree Mr. had the sablefish and I had the albacore tuna & foie gras.  While both were delectable and delicious, I have to say that I liked Mr's dish more!  His sablefish was light, flavourful, and just so simple.  My tuna was also extremely delicious but the foie gras, while extremely delicious was just a bit too rich for me.   Course 3: Miku Signature Sushi Oh my goodness...their specialty is aburi sushi and they in fact executed this fantastically.  I loved every bite of the aburi sushi and what was so nice about this flame-torched sushi was that you didn't have that \"burnt\" flavour overpower your fish.    Course 4: Buche de noel Delicious cake - how can you not like cake.  This is a holiday exclusive so aside from the opera cake (which you're not allowed to substitute BUT can order separately if you have an endless pit), this is a cake specially made for the holidays.    Be sure to pair your meal with a delicious sake or two.  We ordered a bottle of the gold omachi and it was heaven with our meal."}
{"text":"What a lovely experience we had tonight at Miku. This is a beautiful, pristine space with outstanding service.  We decided to try the five course dinner, lots of variety and the chance to try some goodies not on the menu.  The first course: Two different oysters - good One scallop with bacon jam - yum! Mixed sashimi and dainty balls of sushi - perfect, golden eyed snapper was awesome  Second course Bouillabaisse with calamari, sablefish, mussels and the most incredible saffron-tomato broth  Third course Medium prime rib with a nice sauce, delicious mushrooms sautéed with sake and moron, pickled wasabi. Delicious  Fourth course Six pieces of sushi, including their famous torched pieces and some not on the regular menu. The golden eyed snapper was fantastic.  Fifth course Green tea opera cake, matcha ice cream and mascarpone/tofu over fruit. I'm not a fan of green tea/matcha in sweets, but this was well done. I traded my ice cream across the table for more of the mousse like mascarpone with fruit.  Wine: Stonebird Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand was a perfect complement.  All in all, excellent dinner. Would return again for a splurge dinner."}
{"text":"Worth the money   Must try the Salmon Oshi !! The flavour is unlike anything I have ever tried. Would definitely come back just for this dish. Cast iron baked mussels, sake Atlantic salmon sashimi and soft shell crab roll were also very very good. But I wish I stuck to trying more of the specialty dishes (boxed, flame grilled sushi).   Be prepared to break the bank if you come on a empty stomach, dishes start around $18 (we're talking like 6 pieces of sushi).   Great atmosphere, and good for special occasions. Great service as well, the wait staff were obviously knowledgable and helpful with suggestions."}
{"text":"Probably like so many others, I came to Miku for Winterlicious and got the $48 dinner.  I managed to grab a last minute booking on the website the night before, I guess maybe they make them available late, so it may not be fully booked, or some people cancelled.  The restaurant decor is quite upscale and fancy given it is in the financial district where the high rollers hang out.  I ordered the aburi sushi appetizer, beef tenderloin with foie gras, and the green tea opera cake for dessert. I really like torched sushi, and it was very flavourful and delicious. The beef tenderloin was well, tender along with a fusion-like sauce. My GF ordered a different entree, the miso fish with lobster tail, also was tremendous, excellent taste. The opera cake is good as well, however the matcha ice cream is a bit too strong for my tastes.  Overall, the portions were pretty small, but it was marginally enough for dinner. Miku is a bit pricey, but the food is quite good, great service. Would come back another time if I'm feeling splurgy.  Tip: You can take the new PATH connection from Union Station by going through the Air Canada Centre!"}
{"text":"This is an expensive restaurant. A plate like this picture (a small lobster and half of chicken breast) cost CAD$48 (USD$37). Nothing extraordinary about the taste. I would rather use the money eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've been to Miku Vancouver, which was a restaurant with a stunning sea-side view and gorgeous sushi. Miku Toronto is similarly near water but is tucked inside a huge building. We couldn't find the entrance at first but the waiter let us in through the back door. Everyone immediately exclaimed \"IRRASHAIMASE!\", regardless of whether or not they were of Japanese descent (some of them had slight accents). They have coat check and they give you a number to hold onto.  It's a very spacious restaurant swarming with young Asian teenagers (y'know, rich second generation), the wealthy elderly and families trying Miku out. My friend and I probably ordered the least amount of food in the whole restaurant. It's kind of funny because the tables beside us had piles of artistically crafted food that never seemed to stop coming, but we ordered a humble portion and a dessert, splitting the food between us. The waiter highly suggested the pressed sushi, which Miku is famous for, so we ordered salmon aburi, as well as beef carpaccio and calamari as appetizers. The food came pretty quickly and the appetizers definitely tasted interesting. The calamari had a black sauce that tasted really good with the squid- otherwise the calamari itself was rather bland. I liked the carpaccio because it had chunks of fresh Asian crystal pear to eat it with!  The pressed sushi is very... buttery? One can even call it oily. It's in a cute rectangular shape with a secret layer of salmon inside of it. It's worth trying out- it does taste good- but I may try a different kind of aburi sushi next time. The dessert is instagram-worthy. You should really save some room to eat one of these babies. I think the matcha opera seems to be a popular choice amongst the customers! When we walked by other tables the pretty viridescent dessert sparkled under the light.   I will probably come back to try out other dishes, but on a more special occasion. I just popped in because it was their grand opening at the time. With four dishes, we spent around $70~$80? We didn't order any of their huge dishes though, so if you go, the price might be wildly different than what we spent."}
{"text":"Came here twice for birthday celebrations and the service was great.  The atmosphere was very chic, sophisticated, but you'll also see some casually dressed diners as well with their kids/families.  They also offer a small scoop of ice cream for birthday celebrations or if you order one of their dessert items, then they'll write your name on the plate in chocolate and add a candle! Their matcha chocolate ganache cake was delicious!  I really enjoyed having their aburi sushi and their rolls were good too.  There seems to be a lot of detail that goes into their food it's a twist on your traditional sushi restaurant. The flavours melt together so well once they hit the palate and it's those small details that make this place so unique.  Miku is definitely more expensive than typical Japanese restaurants and they serve omakase here too.  I would really only come here for a special occasion or maybe for a snack and not to get full because you're bound to spend about $150 on food/drinks here."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Miku! Ordered two sushi dishes here and really enjoyed both. One was an assorted platter and the other was the Miku roll. The sushi was extremely good and I still think about it all the time! I remember the Miku roll literally melting in my mouth. The service was excellent with the staff being very knowledgeable with the menu and the various dishes. The atmosphere is upscale and classy. It's definitely a pricey choice but worth a try if you are a fan of Japanese dishes!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best dessert in the world.  And the main courses are incredible as well.  Great option for vegetarians with garden rolls.  Also, they can make a soba noodle dish for vegetarians.  The dessert is so good!  Definitely dont miss it.  Matcha fondant lava cake is hands down the best!"}
{"text":"We came here for a late Saturday night dinner and it was delicious. I would save this restaurant for future \"special\" events as it can get pricy depending on what you order.   We started off with a complimentary amuse bouche as we knew one of the chefs from high school. *thumbs up* It was some squid and wasabi and edible flower concoction which was quite nice.  We then had half a Red Wave roll and half a Miku roll and both were quite good, they're both very soft rolls with great flavours but I think I preferred the Red Wave roll over the Miku roll.   Then we had the Miku Waterfront Platter. The presentation was beautiful and it caught a lot of people's attention around us. The oysters were fresh and good. The oyster shooters were quite tasty (minus the cucumber that I didn't think really went with it and was more like a choking hazard). The sashimi was good and very fresh. The prawns were a nice size (not those dinky cocktail shrimp). The mussels were sad and tiny and used as a filler for the giant dish the food was served in. The kaisen poke wasn't my cup of tea and neither were the Hokkaido scallops. I did quite enjoy the salmon ceviche (minus the olives). The kale goma-ae was a nice palette cleanser.   I also order the Miyazaki #2 and it was very good. I almost didn't order it because of the mango puree and I'm not a big fan of mango drinks but it was well balanced and not overpowering.   Then we had the Soft Shell Crab Fritter roll and although it was presented very nicely, I would not order this again. I really disliked the fritter batter on the soft shell crab. It was very oily and sickening. Thankfully, the bf still enjoyed it so it didn't go to waste.  We tried the Aburi Oishi Plate and the standout for me was definitely the Ebi Oshi Sushi, which was very surprising as I typically fine ebi nigiri to be quite boring but the sauce made it delectable.  Lastly, we couldn't skip on dessert even though we were quite full, we ordered the Green Tea Opera and I would highly recommend it. It's presented nicely and it was very delicious."}
{"text":"The sushi was extremely delicious and the salad had huge portions. Very reasonable price for lunch! The service was also impeccable. would recommend this restaurant for any Japanese food lovers!"}
{"text":"A BC gem that recently moved to Toronto, Miku reminded me that you don't need to be on the west coast to have a taste of Japan.  Exquisite decor with a team of more than attentive staff, Miku makes a great dinner spot for a special occasion or corporate gathering.  My friend and I visited on a Friday evening, and we inadvertently joined a sea of Asians who were also presumably trying Miku for the first time.  It was pretty funny.  Aburi Sashimi - Started off with a beautiful plating of aburi sashimi with sockeye salmon, hotate, and maguro.  Fresh and melts in your mouth, gah. Coal Harbor Platter - A cute bowl fresh oysters, jumbo prawn, mussels, kaisen poke, scallop ceviche, and kale goma.  Kaisen poke and scallop ceviche were both delicately flavoured, and the seafood all tasted quite fresh.  Very good :) Salmon Oshi Sushi - This tasted like what I had at JaBistro and while it's nothing special, I really like jalapeno in my sushi and this was really delicious. Aburi Prime - This was our favourite.  While at first glance it looks almost gimmicky just because each piece looked like the chefs were giving an art lesson, when you try them - they actually taste just as good as they look.  My favourite to eat was the piece with the truffle, and my favourite to look at was the one with a gold speck.  Teehee.   Jasmine & Matcha Ice Cream - The most delish jasmine tea I ever had in ice cream form, Bang Bang should have a talk with the Miku dessert chefs  We could've got the tasting menu with what we paid in the end, but we liked the variety in our meal just as much and I'd definitely give the BC resto a try when I get the chance.  :)"}
{"text":"It's a very cool place and I can see what the fuss is about, but if you want a traditional, primarily raw, robust sushi selection this may not be your place. They have figured out a manner in which to serve the sushi by offering a minimal amount of fish in a unique fashion with a lot of rice and sauces. I knew I might be in trouble when there was no soy or wasabi. It also didn't help that a few of my pieces tasted a little \"off\" and the one shrimp in my selection was mushy and looked glassy.  Maybe we just ordered wrong. The beer was cold and the edamame was warm...Worth trying once. Service and friendliness get better once you get past the hostess brigade."}
{"text":"Another resto that baffles me. The reviews are so good but I found everything so disappointing. Style over substance I guess. I wouldn't recommend, just avoid."}
{"text":"I don't get it. Mediocre flavour for an incredible price. If you got money to burn, head over to Miku and give it a try...  I sampled quite a few of there menu items (mostly aburi) and nothing really blew me away. For the balance of our bill, I should have been blown away... I'm a firm believer that you don't have to spend a lot to get good sushi / sashimi in this town. Although I will admit; the service was impeccable. But that's not enough to bring me back..."}
{"text":"I first heard about this restaurant through a friend who has been a big fan of this waterfront restaurant originally from Vancouver B.C. With much excitement we decided to try this on opening day. Miku is located near the RBC Waterpark Place. My first impression of this place was that it is a pretty trendy upscale place with nice high ceilings and nice ambiance. The music was very uplifting yet chill and dance to the beat music.  My friend had pretty fond memories of the aburi in Vancouver, so we decided to try it! We decided to try the Salmon Oshi, Ebi Oshi, Saba Oshi, as well as the Coal Harbour platter.  The presentation of everything that we ordered was pretty amazing. Lots of attention to detail to the way it was presented.   The top layer of the aburi was pretty amazing (melts in your mouth kind of feeling). There were about 6 pieces per dish so good for sharing with 2-3 people. I found that the salmon aburi (the one with the green circle on it, perhaps chilli pepper??) has a spicy kick to it. The one with the eel had an interesting burnt taste to it. I now love torched sushi!  The Coal Harbour platter was very nice as well for sampling some of the chef's selection of fresh oysters, mussels, jumbo prawns, kaisen poke, scallop ceviche, and kale goma-ae. Each piece was very meticulously placed and nicely arranged. Everything was very fresh. The most interesting experience I had aside from trying all the fresh seafood was the oyster shooter where they put oysters in a shot glass mixed with soy sauce and you shoot it like vodka. It tasted kind of salty and the oyster got stuck in the bottom of the glass. But overall it was a fun experience trying it.  For dessert we decided to try the Green Tea Opera. It was like a piece of art and tasted amazing with many layers of different textures smushed into one piece of cake. I like the texture of waffers and pretty sure they incorporated some of that into the dessert as well with coffee taste. There is a piece of crystsallized sugar on the side as well which I found added a nice pretty touch to the overall presentation of the dessert. It was so pretty that I did not want to eat it.  Overall the service was pretty good and the waiters were pretty friendly. In fact we had a quick chat with the waiter and found out he recently moved to Toronto from Vancouver as well!  All in all, if you have not tried it yet I would recommend trying this place at least once."}
{"text":"The renovation here was very nice, high end, fancy kind of vibes. We ordered a lot of food for two people from rolls, to sashimi to aburi sushi. Overall, the food was alright, nothing particularly 'wow-ed' me, especially at that price point paid I would have expected perhaps something different/special. Service was great, our hostess was very attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"Great place to try different types of sushi! Their Kaisen platter is worth a try. Servers are really nice and pleasant. The sushi variety is really worth the visit here. The serving was slightly lesser than what I am used to but the fact that the sushi is made with a blowtorch and coal made it taste smokey. Overall it was pretty quiet with the ambience.  They had a jalapeno sushi that tasted bang on. Will return with friends again :)"}
{"text":"I loved Miku Vancouver and so I just had to try it when they opened a location in my hometown, Toronto.  I came here with a group and we literally tried 70% of the menu, including all of the desserts.  Firstly, the service is just superb.  I was really annoying and kept changing my reservations and the lady who was helping me was super helpful and patient with me.  When I got there, I noticed that there was a special note to thank me for my group reservation.  That has never happened to me before so I was just blown away!  Our server was spectacular and he was bubbly, entertaining and made great recommendations for our group.  We ended up sharing everything and he was really accommodating and even brought out knives and forks for us to cut things up.  I highly recommend ordering everything to share as opposed to their tasting menu if you are there with a group.    Everything tasted really good, and surprisingly their non-seafood dishes were totally on point.  Their prime rib was the best I've ever tasted - I didn't even think I liked prime rib!  At $33 for the prime rib, I'd come back just for that and their desserts.  So we pretty much ordered one of each of the desserts and the chefs took their time to make it all.. how would you say it?  Instagram worthy!  It was beautiful and tasted amazing.  Everything was infused with something else, it was just so fancy.  At the end of the night, our server managed splitting our bills perfectly despite the complexities of the way we ended up splitting it.  Everyone was really impressed.  I highly recommend this place for a special event or just something different to try.  You'll notice that I didn't even mention the charred sushi, and this is because everyone already knows that this is their signature dish and that it is fantastic."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this restaurant because my brother raved about his experience at the Vancouver location.  I decided to come here for lunch because it was slightly more affordable. I got the Premium ($29), Ebi oshi sushi ($17), Miku roll ($22) and Sous-vide rib eye with heritage green salad ($24).  The premium is a selection of trdational and Aburi nigiri, oshi and sushi rolls (12 pieces). I highly recommend getting this so that you can experience all the different type of sushi they have to offer.  We ordered the ebi oshi sushi (pressed prawn, lime zest, ume suace) because the waitress told us it's not part of the premium that day. Before ordering any of the sushi, I would recommend that you make sure you're not doing any repeats. This dish tasted good but it wasn't memorable compared to the other dishes.  Next, we had the Miku roll (salmon, crab, uni, cucumber, rolled in tobiko, Miku sauce). This is a must get. The tobiko was extra juicy (I don't know how else to describe it) and tasted very fresh.  Lastly, I ordered the sous-vide ribe eye with a salad (6 oz AAA sterling silver, stilton cheese, pear, endive, yuzu vinaigrette, soy balsamic reduction, wasabi chimichurr) for my dad because he can't have anything raw. I thought that this dish was reasonably priced, filling and it tasted very good. The steak was very tender and the salad was very fresh. I would recommend this if you can't have sushi but you're here with your friends.  The food was great and the service was awesome. I can't wait to come back here again!"}
{"text":"The best meal of my year may have already happened!  In January to boot!   Lots of reviews already for this place, so here's my 2 cents (I'm not a Toronto local - up from the States).    FOOD:   1)  You might not thing to try the AAA Sterling Silver Prime Rib.  Do.  OMG.  Absolutely unreal - as good as any steakhouse.  Just completely succulent and little to no fat - literally clean your plate.    2) Salmon Oshi Sushi - WOW.  Incredible flavor and freshness.  I'll be back for more of these!   ATMOSPHERE: Trendy couples plus business people on work dinners.   We sat at the bar in the restaurant and it was centrally located and very comfortable.  Great people watching.    STAFF: Attentive and fun - they were always there when we needed them."}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about Miku from friends and Yelpers that I knew when they had a Winterlicious menu for 2017, I had to try it.   Came here Friday evening with a 7pm reservation.  Unfortunately we end up waiting close to 7:20 before we were seated. I noticed the party who arrived before me had a reservation at 7:15 and they chose to seat them before us (just because they arrived first). Oh well! We got seated in one of those big comfy booths by the window.   We all ordered the same thing for the Winterlicious special. Aburi Signature Seletection to start, Miso Sablefish with poached half lobster tail and finally their famous green tea opera dessert. First, the aburi selection was amazing. I enjoyed the variety of rolls that came with this dish (approx 6 pieces). It was melt in your mouth sushi and the flavours were electric. After my appetizer, I seriously wanted to order another roll on the side! Next, we had our main which was the sablefish with half lobster tail. The fish was great, majority of the time people know this as black cod. It was so tasty, and I really enjoyed the cauliflower fritter. The lobster tail was a bit bland and nothing to rave about. I found the portion was a bit small. I could've used a larger piece of fish. I thought the dish would be delicious with the sablefish alone as this was the highlight of the dish. Finally, I tried the green tea opera cake. Perfect texture, soft and crispy and the matcha ice cream was a hit. We even got another dessert to share, which I could only remember the Jasmine ice cream. Apparently they make all their ice cream in house.   I highly recommend Miku and I'll definitely be back to try the restaurant's regular menu next time!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this Miku as we've been to the one in Vancouver. Doesn't compare, alburi was good but we were disappointed by the coal harbour platter. The portions were small and lacked in flavour. Servers kept on disrupting us like 7 times even though it was obvious we were deep in a conversation. Kept on asking us to add dishes, deserts, drinks. Did not expect such upselling for a restaurant like this.."}
{"text":"Miku is one of those places where you end up paying $200 for two and still feel great about it.   The service was impeccable, the food was absolutely amazing and the atmosphere couldn't be cozier. Despite the high prices, you can walk-in and enjoy a meal in your casual attire. The place is also child friendly, they have a bunch of boosters and high chairs.   The outside patio is facing the Main Street and can be a little noisy although it is nice on a weekend.   The selection of sake is impressive. Our server was informative about the sake and he helped us to pick the right flight. FYI, all of the sake they serve is premium, so please DO NOT ask them to heat it up since the heating process may destroy the delicate flavours and accents of the yeast."}
{"text":"I'd give Miku a 4.5 if I could. It was absolutely wonderful but I just can't bring myself to give it a 5 star because I'm comparing it to Yasu and JaBistro, assuming they're in the same class. Miku gives more of a restaurant vibe because it's so spacious and bright inside (great for a casual date night or with a group of friends), whereas I prefer that intimate environment found in a small Japanese restaurant with about 10-15 seats. It makes the experience more personal, which was what I was looking for that night because it was for my birthday. Their service is great, everyone is very friendly and knowledgeable with the menu. I also loved the plating, it was very aesthetically pleasing - perfect for IG photos!! I would definitely come back here again, since it isn't going to rip apart my wallet as badly as the other omakase places haha.   We ordered the Aburi Prime Set Menu ($98 per person). It started off with 4 dishes - 4 pieces of sashimi (sockeye salmon and hamachi), beef carpaccio, miso baked sablefish (which is just black cod), and some sort of chicken liver thing??? Our waiter also provided 2 different types of soy sauces and explained the difference to us. All 9 pieces were great but the nigiri pieces that stood out to me were the uni and the snow crab ones. Those just melt in your mouth and it was soooooo buttery and smooth. Another honourable mention is the sauce on the ocean trout nigiri which made it so damn good. There was a nigiri with a truffle sauce which was bomb af but I forgot which piece it was. Those were without a doubt phenomenal. We also ordered the Miku Roll ($22) which was very yummy and is a must order here! However it's very similar to the JaBistroll at JaBistro which tasted slightly better but it was so alike it didn't matter. For drinks, we ordered the Ichigo Smash ($17) and Shisho Mojito ($16) - they were both very refreshing! My birthday dessert was a matcha and azuki cake and it was so good. It came along with a scoop of rich matcha ice cream and you can never go wrong with that! Typing this review just makes me want to make a reservation asap. I also saw that Miku does Winterlicious so I can't wait for that!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is phenomenal, especially the blow-torched fish, which is what Miku is largely known for. Come here and expect really good, well executed food. Perhaps one of the best sushi restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Amazing, best meal I've ever eaten. Did the Omakase (Chef's choice). 5 courses of delicious"}
{"text":"I've been to Miku several times now. The first couple of times I only had their aburi sushi and some appetizers. The aburi sushi are heavenly... the fish literally melt in my mouth, was well seasoned and I love the smoky broiled taste. The appetizers are hit and miss... some like tofu salad are very good with an interesting twist of the old classic, other like edamame are way over-priced ($7 for plain edamame with some salt?). HOWEVER, the last time I went we ordered the saber fish main course. The dish was quite oily and salty... perfect with a bowl of steam rice... WHICH THEY DO NOT OFFER! As a result the saber fish was practically inedible. The other main dish was steak, which looks like it could use a nice bowl of steam rice too. We also ordered the Ichigo mochi dome that, while an interesting twist on fruit daifuku, felt a bit disjointed as none of the ingredient really go with each other.  I will stick to their sushi next time I go."}
{"text":"I remember this place from when it was a bar and served Italian food. Now it is the Toronto branch of a sushi chain.  First, they must have spent a fortune on this place. The location is expensive and the decoration is top-notch. It reflects the food which is fusion modern Japanese. The door could belong to a mansion. Food wise I had the Aburi sushi mix. It is hit and miss in the sense that they want to be modern and innovative which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. The salmon roe on top of sushi worked. The miso on top of mackerel worked. The citrus rind on top didn't work. By the way, every sushi piece has a topping here by law. They bring you two kinds of soya sauce regular and sweet. The regular is the right one. Finally, don't sit at the bar. It is interesting to see that they have about 30 people working in the kitchen (our waiters were sadly not Japanese though so I wonder if the chefs are all Japanese but I don't think so which is a little inauthentic) alone but you cannot see the sushi chefs at work, the fish or the sushi being made. What's up with that?"}
{"text":"I always try to go a few times before I review any restaurant. Miku is no exception. Hands down it's the best Japanese fusion in Toronto. Always get reservations. The food is so fresh and very well seasoned. The servers are well trained and are very knowledgeable about each menu item.  Given it's very pricey, about $450 including tips for a party of 3, one of which is 7 years old :) but so worth it."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite dinning places in Toronto. Too bad there's no view like the Vancouver one or I would go a lot more often. The food is always fresh and delicious. I highly recommend the pan seared scallops and the aburi salmon sushi is just have. The seafood platters are nice for sharing too. The staff is always nice and even remembers you. And for ice cream lovers try the jasmine tea ice cream it's amazing!   My most recent outing here was for a joint birthday celebration for myself and a friend. Because we had a large group we had to do a private room. Which required some booking arrangements ahead of time with event coordinator which went very smoothly and she was very attentive and helpful. We had a vegetarian in the group and a guest with dietary restrictions and the head chef was willing to adjust and customize the fixed menu for them. The event went very well and the waiter was very organised and polite. The food was outstanding!"}
{"text":"It's a nice and elegant restaurant, you'll feel comfortable seated in the spacious layout and calm ambience.  The inside of the restaurant is a lot bigger than I expected (compared to all the high-end Japanese restaurants in Toronto that i've been to).   We ordered the Miku Signature Selection and the Premium Aburi Nigiri. The selection was amazing and our server introduced every type of fish to us that was on the plate. Loved the uni that was serviced in a spoon, thought that was pretty creative! Wasabi is already incorporated in every sushi so they do not come with the plates separately. There were two dishes of soy sauce, one for regular fish and the other one for fattier fish. Pretty cool. Some of the \"spices\" of certain nigiris overpowered the fish itself. But all in all it was a great dining experience.   Service is what you will expect and love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The services was great and the food was really yummy but there is a place called m Monosan that does a very similar menu but for less of the price.  That being said, the food was good. The oyster shots were so good we ordered another round. The oshi sushi was really nice as well. We got the mixed platter to try one of each. We got a whole plate of the brûléed salmon with the jalop on top as one of them which my me favourite I think. Mmmmm so good! We also got the coal harbour platter   It was all really nice but I like the other place better flavour wise and price wise"}
{"text":"Lunch pricing was excellent, $29 for lots of sampler dishes got me very full.  Second time for dinner was very pricey but partly because we ordered the (delicious) plum wine which increased costs.  Food is impeccable, we had seared sashimi which was rich in ingredients and presentation.  A recommend to anyone in the area, or just enthusiasts looking for some quality a la carte sushi."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place since it got awesome reviews. To be honest, everything was quite underwhelming.  The food were not bad, everything tasted fine, but for the price, i was hoping for something that other sushi restaurants in GTA couldn't offer. I think for the same price I would have gotten better variety and quantity at Nichiban sushi in Markham. Would not come again."}
{"text":"First time at Miku was a success! Definitely lived up to the hype, and I will certainly return in the future.   To start off, the restaurant was fairly empty during lunch on Sunday. We were promptly seated, and introduced to the menus.   For appetizers we ordered shrimp tempura and a sampler plate, and for mains we ordered platters of their specialty blowtorched sushi: salmon aburi sushi, miku roll, and red wave roll. Everything was fresh, flavourful, and delicious!  Dessert however, was underwhelming. I ordered the green tea opera cake, and it was not anything special, and was heavier than expected.  All dishes came within 15-20 minutes, and we were continuously checked on by staff. Our host was very helpful with recommendations, and was very attentive.   Overall, lunch was amazing! 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"I have tried sushi before and hated it, but that was ages ago. So a couple of friends decided to take me to Miku to see if they could change that feeling. I agreed to this mad scientist idea and that was probably one of the best decisions I have ever made. Boy was this an experience.  Let's start with the restaurant. It is rather large and is honestly beautiful inside. The ambiance of the restaurant really sets the whole mood for what you are about to experience.  Food: When it came to food we ordered a bunch of items off the menu because we literally could not figure out what we wanted to try. We ordered the beef carpaccio, tempura calamari, 2 dishes from the aburi oshi section (salmon oshi, ebi oshi), red wave roll, soft shell crab fritter roll, wagyu, and many more. I personally enjoyed everything, some aspects were off to me when it came to texture (I am weird) but flavor was not lacking at all.  Top Picks: Salmon Oshi, Ebi Oshi, and the Soft Shell Crab Fritter Roll were literally perfection. The flavors in each one are just outstanding, the combine perfectly with each other and are an experience while eating them.  Low Picks: The Scallop Sashimi was not something I would try again. That is the one item that had an off texture to me. Flavor was amazing, but the texture is off putting.  In the end Miku is outstanding. It is a great place for anyone who loves sushi and maybe even better for those who are on the side lines. This place will definitely hit your pocket if you order a ton like we did, but for the experience that comes with the hit it is so worth it. I have not been in such awe before and will definitely be returning..... when my wallet can take a hit again .... Bill came out to $400+, but we did order a lot of food so take that into consideration."}
{"text":"Always visit this place when I'm around the harbour front area. One of my favourite sushi restaurants. The environment is classy and high end.   Waiters are attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  Services is excellent but even better when you have a booth or a table. Service at the sushi bar is slower and less attentive. It feels like there is no designated server. So there's multiple waiters serving you at the bar areas.   Top two favorite dishes are the Salmon oshi and the miku roll.   Salmon oshi sushi ($17) - Absolutely delicious, this is one of the dishes you must try if you visit miku. I'd say that miku has the best torched salmon oshi. I find it tastier than JaBistro and other places that offer this dish. The sushi here flows, the sauce, the salmon and the rice feels like one. It all melts in side your mouth. Compared to other restaurants, there is usually a disconnection between the rice and salmon but not there.   Miku roll ($23) - This sushi roll has uni but you can barely taste it. It also has sockeye salmon and crab in it. Similar to the salmon oshi it blends in very well.   Ebi oshi sushi ($17) -  The ebi is a little thin, you cannot taste much of the shrimp, more of the rice. The sauce on top was ok but a little more on the citrus side. Still prefer the salmon over this one.  Saba Oshi Sushi ($16) - These ones are the mackerel torched sushi, this one is pretty taste as well, not much fishy smell to it. Again, miku does a good job in making the torched sushi's blend very well.   Tip: The Oshi Sushi taste best when they are warm. If the sushi is some what cool, you should as them to retorch it.   Seared foie gras ($17) - it just tasted like any other seared foie gras. First one had a creamy soft texture but the second one wasn't as good. It was crispy on the outside and a little chewy. It tasted more like the texture of fried tofu. I didn't like the cranberry topping they added. It was a little too sour for my liking. I pretty much scraped it off and just ate the foie gras alone. Also, it came with a small side of salad.   We've also ordered some niguri and sashimi.   Wagyu Beef niguri ($10) - Felt like this niguri is not worth it. It was very thin. I prefer the steak type of wagyu better. You can't taste much meat from this and it's pricey.   Unagi niguri ($4.5 each) - It's BBQ eel, these ones also lightly seared and delicious. The eel didn't taste fishy, and the eel sauce complemented the niguri well   Ikura roe niguri ($5) - Extremely fresh, one of the best I've tasted.   As for sashimi, we ordered a variety of different kinds of fishes. We ordered the Red Tuna, Sockeye Salmon, Atlantic Salmon, Hokkaido Scallop, Botan ebi/ spot prawn, O toro   Sockeye salmon - texture tasted more like tuna or meat. Preferred the Atlantic salmon over the sockeye. Red tuna was average.   Botan ebi / Spot prawn ($5 each/ 6 for $30) - The raw shrimps are huge. They tasted fresh and sweet. After eating the shrimps, the heads are then deep fried to be eaten as a whole or you can just suck the head and eat the brains/goo inside.  O toro - It was delicious and really fat. Pricey but worth a try. I think it was about ($16) per niguri.   Green tea opera ($13.50) - We were told that this dessert takes 3 days to make. That cake is a layered with green tea sponge cake, matcha butter, a layer of chocolate cake with red bean cream on top of a hazelnut wafer. It also came with a side of matcha ice cream top with a sesame sugar cookie  Warm matcha chocolate fondant ($14) - the matcha chocolate is similar to just a regular chocolate lava cake. You can barely taste the matcha. Jasmine ice cream is delicious though. It was full of tea flavour and wasn't too sweet.   Miqoo ($6) - It was pretty must orange juice with lemon soda. Nothing special and not worth getting  Soda and ice tea ($3) - Ask for less ice or no ice to get the most of your drink. They usually fill it with 60-70% ice.    They also have an outdoor patio during the summer. Great place to dine and enjoy the weather. They have pretty comfy couches outdoors.   Overall, i love this place. Definitely recommend it. It's pricey but i feel like its worth it. The sushi is delicious and the sashimi is extremely fresh.   P.S. There's underground parking right under the building. Parking is $4 per 20 minutes and daily max it $20. Miku does not validate parking."}
{"text":"We tried the lunch menu on Sunday and we found that there's not a lot items to chooses from Price is solid, 50$ each for a high end restaurant Food is okay, some of the sushi is weird to me and my friend  If you want to try fusion Japanese food, you can come here and try it out"}
{"text":"Great place for pressed sushi! The fish was very fresh, and the rice was just the perfect texture. Price is fair for the quality you are paying for. Would recommend the premium aburi plate."}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to try out Miku after seeing and hearing the positive feedback about this restaurant and have to say I'm a little disappointed. The service was really friendly and attentive but the food was a bit lacking.  I came in during their Winterlicious 2018 menu to sample a variety of their offerings and found the food to only be OK. I tried their aburi sushi selection, bacon wrapped beef tenderloin and green tea opera from the Winterlicious menu. In addition I ordered their signature Miku roll and Grapefruit Basil Smash for a drink.  They advertised their sushi to be more unique/fusion which didn't require soy sauce and wasabi but I found that there wasn't enough flavour for a few of the pieces. The fish also didn't seem the freshest. The Miku roll was also extremely similar to JaBistro's Jabistroll but I found could not compare.  My favourite dish was the Bacon Wrapped Beef Tenderloin. This dish was delicious. The beef was tender and juicy and was accompanied by nicely grilled brussel sprouts. Highly recommend getting just their brussel sprouts as an appetizer.  The Green Tea Opera dessert was also pretty good. A cake with 7 different layers of green tea and matcha. The cake was very rich and the little scoop of ice cream really helped offset that.  I'd say this place is a 3.5. I had pretty high expectations for the seafood and that's where I think missed the mark. I enjoyed their other dishes but they are supposed to be known for their fish which is why I'm a bit disappointed.   I'd probably come back if a friend asked to go but I don't think I'll choose this as a first choice as their price point opens up a lot of options downtown."}
{"text":"Miku was listed as one of the top places to check out if you're looking for high end sushi... but I'm sorry to say... it's a disappointment.  I will caveat this and say that I'm a traditional nigiri fan; not an aburi fan.    In any case, we tried a variety of dishes from the sushi sets to the prime rib.  Nothing amazed and the price point seemed to be inflated with the restaurant's hope of being considered a high quality sushi joint.    The service was also found wanting.  The recommendations from our waiter never really lived up to the hype and I began wondering if he was making recommendations purely based on puffing up the bill or because he was sincerely trying to discern our taste for sushi.  Overall, the experience was very underwhelming and I don't think I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Tried sushi from a handful of places, not a crazy fan..but I'll go to Miku anytime. The sushi is incredible here. You're paying for quality food. And the venue is fantastic."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  The food melts in your mouth and the service is amazing.  I have an allergy to shell fish and the staff and manager will come and ensure they understand what I can and cannot eat and they are happy to substitute the dishes to your taste.  They shows they care and want the customers to have a good experience.  Food is on the pricier side so we waited for their Winterlicious deal.  Been to this restaurant twice and been very happy about it."}
{"text":"Cool place, staff is friendly. The food is fresh, the sushi was great, it is fusion sushi though, interesting flavours. Regarding the price we payed 70$ each for 5 pieces of sashimi and 13 pieces of sushi."}
{"text":"One of my friends had never properly tried quality sushi so after doing some research, I chose Miku for the spot that would convince him. I reserved a table for 3 on a Thursday night and we were promptly seated once we arrived. The restaurant is fairly large and the interior is clean and refined. For drinks, they have a decent selection of wines and Japanese imports.  When it came to ordering, we were unable to decide so we picked many items off the menu. To name only a few we tried the wagyu, carpaccio, sashimi selection, calamari, 2 of the aburi sushi options as well as the red wave, miku, and soft shell crab fritter rolls. No complaints on any of the dishes - in fact we ordered more dishes after the first round.  Favorites: Aburi salmon oshi is very tasty and melts in your mouth with a little heat kicking in from the jalapeno on top. Highly suggest ordering at least one of the pressed aburi sushi to try as they are known for their aburi. The wagyu is 10$ a piece but also recommended if you haven't had before.  Least Favorites: Miku roll was probably the least favorite as it didn't stand out in any way but as with every other dish, the quality of the ingredients at least held it together. The scallop sashimi also had an undesirable texture and flavor pairing but the accompanying sashimi were all great.  For dessert we finished off with green tea opera cake which I had tried before at Taste of Toronto and was just as good as I remembered it.  Overall an excellent night of food. Everything was plated beautifully. As for my friend, he was convinced. Admittedly, all dishes were not perfect and I have had better sushi in Japan but Miku has pleasant flavors and texture combos I had not tried before. We were all stuffed by the end of it - since we ordered so much, the bill for the night ran a little higher than expected ($400+). Worth it."}
{"text":"To be very honest...the food was okay. I came here with my boyfriend for winterlicious ($28 lunch per person). The appetizer was disappointing because everything tasted really plain and basic, except for the shrimp. For the main course we ordered the sushi plate. I think only 2/7 of the sushi tasted good because some of the sauces they put on them were extremely odd and it took away the freshness of the fish/sashimi. Dessert was good but not the best I've had. Overall, the food wasn't worth its price lol...I honestly don't know why people are so hyped up about this restaurant.   In terms of service, it was okay as well...when we walked into the restaurant it took them awhile to greet us so it was pretty awkward. The atmosphere was not very welcoming and I feel like we were being judged probably because we weren't dressed formally?  Overall, not the best restaurant I've visited. Will not return!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 5 - very nice atmosphere with friendly staff. We were greeted out loud by all the kitchen staff when we entered which was nice! The octopus, calamari, and clam appetizer platter was abit disappointing - it tasted like it was reheated. Must try: any of the Miku abut I style rolls!"}
{"text":"Miku is amazing in a lot of ways. You'd be forgiven to think miku is a snooty restaurant given the location and decor, but once inside and seated you'll find the wait staff quite friendly and accommodating.  You certainly can go all out and have an expensive meal here, but for the more budget minded, there are also items that are quite reasonably priced. The sake list is impressive with prices to boot, and then again, the house sale is quite reasonable and not bad if you want something to go with your meal.  I highly recommend ordering the salmon aburi sushi, it is to die for and not pricey for what it is.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Miku definitely lived up to its expectations! The seafood was extremely fresh and the plating was an incredible touch. The wait staff was also very knowledgeable but unpretentious. We got a dinner reservation easy enough on a weeknight. It's not extremely packed but decently busy.   We had a bubbly champagne like sake which was perfect for celebrating a birthday. The pressed and torched sushi was mouthwatering and lived up to the hype. Our main was the Coal Harbour platter to share - which had a selection of sashimi and other seafoods (mussels, scallop ceviche, prawns, oyster shooters).   For dessert we tried their signature dessert, green tea opera and it was amazing!! Perfect to share. Overall wonderful dining experience but I think ja bistro is equally comparable."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. My husband took me here for my 30th and I enjoyed every minute of it. Food was prepared and presented with excellent. Our favourites were the aburi oshi and premium nigiri. The matcha cake is also to die for. We opted to order a la carte since it was just the two of us. Our server was also very attentive and came back within appropriate time intervals. When she wasn't available (it was a very busy night), other servers lent a helping hand with our table. I also really appreciated the relaxed and comfortable vibe of the restaurant. Although the food itself was fine dining, no one - neither servers or customers - seemed pretentious or uptight. Everyone seemed so happy to be there, including me! :) Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Love Miku - incredible service, beautiful restaurant, and delicious food. The Aburi sushi is my favorite! Have also done the tasting menu which is great, highly suggest it if it's your first time at Miku!"}
{"text":"I should preface this with the fact that I don't actually like Japanese food (mainly sushi and sashimi) because it's often low quality and makes me nauseous. This place was not like that at all! When I saw the photos I knew this was a place that would make me realize that some raw fish dishes can be amazing. This was the game changer! And yes it was! This place was delicious but expensive!! But I definitely indulged in everything I wanted because YOLO!  I got a flight of 3 sakes, I'm guessing a 1.5-2 oz. pour of each ($21). Very delicious! I really liked getting the flight because I didn't have to commit to just one! Gotta taste them all!   To start, I had the miso soup ($7). It had a nice surprise of mussels. The soup was very flavourful. I saw it had some green onion and enoki mushrooms. Very nice flavours. I won't forget that miso soup!   The main course I had was the aburi sashimi selection ($27), where aburi is the style they make things--it uses a blowtorch of some kind so it's slightly cooked on the outside. It was a very nice way to eat it! The fats are caramelized somewhat. Very delicious. There were 8 pieces, 4 different types (so 2 of each). Different raw delicacies including fancy tuna and scallops. I didn't know I would like raw scallops ever, but this place made me realize I do sometimes! Very nice flavours, all pretty unique and well-thought out. Some fresh herb flavours, tanginess, sesame oil at some point... All very tasty!  For dessert, one of my friends decided to show up and join me so we split 2 desserts ($13.50 x 2, + $2 for an extra spoon of some unidentifiable round thing with liquid inside). The deconstructed piña colada and yuzu with coconut ice cream was pretty good. I'm normally not a fan of mousse but they did a good job. We also got the green tea dessert. The cakes with that were absolutely delicious! Very flavourful. Caramelly. I didn't taste green tea at all. The ice cream, though, was probably the least impressive thing I ate there. I found that it tasted like if you were to eat a spoonful of matcha powder. The flavour of that wasn't very well incorporated. I've had good matcha lattes made with real, good quality matcha, so I'm pretty sure the ice cream had more potential than that.   I also had a 1 oz. dram of the 21-year Nikka whiskey ($15) because I love my whiskey! I'm really into high-quality scotch, and I've tried Japanese whiskey before and liked it so I had to do it. It was very delicious. Nice and smokey. I got it with the rocks on the side, which were pretty and came with a set of tongs.   The patio was nice and romantic--perfect for dinner by myself! haha. They have heat lamps for when it's cold. I could reach some Harbourfront Pokemon from the patio, too.   All in all, perfect spot to indulge in, and change your mind if you think you don't like Japanese food! I love it but will only go back once in a while because damn, that's an expensive habit! Expensive but totally worth it. I didn't feel ripped off at all but I really love going out to eat. This was a great experience, and the staff were friendly, professional, knowledgeable (and if they didn't know they checked).   5 stars! 10 out of 10!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I normally am not a fan of sushi, specifically I don't like eating raw fish. However, this isn't completely raw. Came here for Winterlicious, and got the Miku Aburi platter, sable fish and lobster tail and the green tea opera cake.  Miku Aburi - 5*/5*, the sauce is seeped into the nigiri, it tasted delicious, there was only one I didn't like, the white piece of sushi, but the rest all tasted amazing. They don't recommend soy sauce as they already have sauces on it, but it is delicious, wished I could have some of these pieces of sushi now.  Sable fish and Lobster tail - 4*/5*, the lobster tail was the smallest lobster tail you can find, some jumbo shrimp are bigger than this lobster tail. The taste of the lobster was meh, it wasn't amazing, but the sable fish was delicious, it melts in your mouth. The sides were fried cauliflower which I also liked.  Green Tea Opera Cake - 4*/5*, I expected this to be a soft cake, but it's crunchy at the bottom, it tasted delicious though, it has hazelnut and almonds too, so why am I rating it 4* instead of 5*? The portion size - it's barely bite sized. Have never seen such small cake and the scoop of matcha ice green was more like 1/3 a scoop at Baskin Robbins.  Overall, ambience was very nice, the floor to ceiling windows is nice, but you feel slightly weirded out if people are walking by and staring at you eating...The food was amazing, but the portion size could be bigger, I understand it's Winterlicious, but for $48, it was the top tier price and they could have added a little more. The server was very nice. I am a fan, and I think I'll grab sushi/nigiri from here from now on."}
{"text":"Excellent presentation of uniquely creative sushi. The prime rib was also expertly prepared. We tried the carpaccio and seaweed salad as well as the sushi platter. Everything was top notch. It is a little pricey but fair due to the quality and artistic presentation. A delight to see and taste."}
{"text":"Five star service along with the five star price but it's pretty much worth it.  The fish is fresh and super tasty and the creativity in the dishes is what makes this place special.     Great ambience and awesome staff - all very knowledgeable and over the top helpful in every aspect.    We had the holiday set menu for $80 each and it was perfect portions and awesome taste with great variety.    Would go back again anytime I'm downtown."}
{"text":"After reading all the good comments about winterlicious, maybe they were all busy taking care of winterlicious customers because I had a worst experience in miku on sunday. I visited miku after 3pm when they were only serving bar bites menu, I sat down, only few of the aburi menu was served and some apps. I ordered tofu salad with miso dressing and saba, sake, and ebi aburi sushi.  Service. TERRIBLE. WORST in high Japanese restaurant. I sat down. The server did not come to take the order until the guy who looked like a floor manager passed by and looked that our menu was closed and try to take the order. She ran into us and said that she is our server so she will be helping us for the day. I got a feeling that she did not want us to talk but to her because its her table. Because it was after lunch winterlicious hour the restaurant was very empty. The food had arrived. Our water glass was empty. But I tried to wait to see our server because I thought that was the manner that she wanted me to follow. Conclusion, I haven't seen my server until I finished all my food and then I asked for my bill. And leaving the restaurant, about 5 people who were working was standing and chatting but did not give a shit about us leaving.   Food. I heard many times miku is a restaurant where you don't get what you pay for. The aburi sushi that I ordered was too saucy, too much flavours in it so it was very hard to keep it in my mouth. Of course the server wasn't around so I could not complain about it at all. And the salad.. I saw it on the winterlicious menu so I thought it was something but paying 14 dollars for those salad was definately too much. If I have experienced better service I wouldn't say miky is not worth the money but food and service in total was worst experience. I would rather go to Jabistro or Japango for better food and servixe"}
{"text":"Miku is definitely one of the top Japanese restaurants Toronto has to offer, although it's more Japanese-Western fusion cuisine as opposed to traditional Japanese fare. I had the five-course kaiseiki meal and I was blown away!   1) Trio of appetizers: The Kusshi and Raspberry Point oysters with tangy mignonette were sweet and oceanic without tasting fishy. The amberjack and yellowfin tuna sashimi were fresh and excellent use of knife work was evident. The Hokkaido scallop was blowtorched to a medium rare consistency and tasted divine!  2) Japanese style bouillabaisse: a much lighter version on the classic with a perfectly piece of grilled black cod  3) Slow roasted AAA prime rib: Although it's no Kobe, the steak was exquisitely tender servced with wasabi brown butter sauce and garlic butter mushrooms.  4) Selection of Aburi style sushi: Miku is well known for their Aburi sushi, which is pressed sushi and gently blowtorched. Although everything was delicious, my favourite was the sockeye salmon with Jalapeno and Miku sweet soy sauce. The blowtorch released the salmon's natural oils which was absorbed into the sushi rice.   5) Trio of desserts: silken tofu and marscapone \"tiramisu\", matcha opera cake, and matcha ice cream. The matcha opera cake apprently takes three days to prepare and I could see why with the intricate layers of sponge cake, adzuki bean paste, coffee wafer, and matcha buttercream.   It's a more upscale restaurant, so be prepare for higher prices but you get what you pay for. A fitting place for a special occassion meal!"}
{"text":"Sushis are good, but I find them a bit fat. Great ambiance, good service. Drink and sake list is well garnished! Seaweeds salad is worth it!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Say no more! Torched sushi is a must. I got the miku zen which includes 4 chef's selection. It was okay. Yes it's on the expensive side but it's realllllly good."}
{"text":"Having flies flying around us at all times says it all. after all these 5 star reviews i was surprised at this place. Sushi were nothing special at all."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for several times. Really love its sushi   pretty decoration. You have so many choices for the main course."}
{"text":"This place is beautifully decorated and very tasty! Our waitress was very nice and attentive  The restaurant is definitely on the pricey side but I will definitely return!  Loved the nigiri, and everything was extremely fresh!"}
{"text":"TLDR: Try their aburi o toro sushi (fat tuna belly), prime rib, and the green tea opera dessert!   Miku is an upscale, classy restaurant, which is located at 10 Bay St or 88 Queens Quay, RBC Waterpark Place (I'm not sure which address is correct as both came up). There are lots of seating available inside the restaurant and in the patio. You can choose to sit in the patio, and I saw people getting blankets in case they were cold. The service was excellent. The staff were very, very professional and knew their stuff. They even went the extra mile by asking us if we were celebrating a special occasion, although we didn't mention anything at the time of reservation. It was a sweet surprise when they brought out the green tea opera dessert decorated with a congratulatory message at the end of our meal. :)  As for food, we shared Pan Seared Scallops, Red Wave Roll, O toro sushi, and a four-course Shokai Kaiseki.   Kaiseki started with a cold platter of assorted oyster, mussels, oyster shooter, scallops and more; then followed by AAA Sterling Silver Prime Rib, five pieces of aburi sushi, and the green tea opera dessert. I particularly enjoyed their aburi o toro sushi, prime rib and the green tea opera dessert.   Aburi o toro sushi had a rich flavour and soft texture, and it just melted in my mouth. The prime rib was probably one of the best prime ribs I've had. My fiancé loved the mashed potato side as well. The sauce on the meat was great, too. We both enjoyed the green tea opera dessert. It was both crispy and soft. It tasted like a mixture of Nanaimo, green tea ice cream and pieces of a crunchy chocolate.   And it's true what they tell you, no need to dip anything to the soy sauce (they still provide sweet soy sauce and regular soy sauce), the maki and sushi pieces were delicious as they were. Miku prides itself in being one of the better aburi sushi options in Toronto, but sadly, I wasn't very impressed with their five-piece aburi sushi plate. The dish included a piece of Salmon Oshi Sushi, which had a slice of jalapeño, and this overwhelmed the taste of the sushi; and salmon aburi sushi was actually one of the better ones.   As for drinks, we each tried a different Japanese plum wine, and both plum wines were decent. Next step for the Miku restaurant would be to make sure that they do a thorough job of cleaning in the dining room. There were fruit flies, flies and other insects at our table, which was a big letdown for a restaurant of this kind, and this distracted us from enjoying our dinner to the fullest. That said, Miku provides a top-notch service and nicely-lit, modern atmosphere. They bring out candles to each table in the evening. It would be an amazing place to impress your date as well as a great lunch spot for downtown workers."}
{"text":"In search of a place that would beat my favourite aburi place in toronto, so i came across this place.  Love the environment here. The sushi was pretty good but not enough to beat my favourite place.  The dessert was okay. Nothing special to me."}
{"text":"This was s truly sushi lunch splurge heaven! I ordered the Traditional sushi platter 10pcs $23, while my friend had the Premium 12 pcs $29, which include an assortment of sushi and their famous Aburi sushi! She also loves Uni, so had the half order for f Uni sashimi (full order $30!) not sure what half order was! She has been to the Vancouver one and says Vancouver Miku is a bit better!  We sat by the window face Queens Quay with occasional smoker sitting by the window, not the greatest view! I enjoyed the sushi very much, the kitchen was very accommodating to my allergies and was willing to substitute items.  Did I mentioned I inhaled my 10pcs in no time and proceeded in ordering a Premium sushi after! When the waiter came to ask for if we wanted dessert, I proudly answered, that was the dessert!   Wish their sushi bar had a lower wall, so u can see how the sushi chef was working. Their sushi bar wasn't really a sushi bar at all, it had a high wall blocking any view of the kitchen, so it is like eating facing the wall!   Since it is such a nice restaurant I was surprised they don't serve u tea, but just tap water! If u want hot tea its additional $3.50! Hence only 3 stars! A nice place to try but too many nice sushi splurge spots in the city to come back again!"}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! Wow!  I can't believe sushi can taste this good!  The restaurant is famous for its aburi (flame-searing) sushi with their specialty sauces.  It is originally from Vancouver and now opened its first restaurant in Toronto.  My friend and I came here yesterday for lunch for the first time.  We read great reviews but we tried not to have too high expectation in case it disappoints us.  It certainly did not disappoint us.  With its contemporary design, the place was absolutely stunning.  The place was so beautiful with its high ceiling and floor-to-ceiling windows.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere especially sitting just next to the patio with the windows all opened up.  I almost forgot that it was a work day.  We decided to order a couple of dishes for sharing because there was so much that we wanted to try.  We started with the Kale Goma-ae sesame salad and the seafood soba which were both very tasty especially the soba.  Next, we had the Premium aburi sushi and the Salmon pressed sushi with jalapeños.  The sushi was so good it literally melts in your mouth.  Love the salmon pressed sushi with their signature sauce that goes so well...it's a must try dish.  The service was impeccable.  Our server was very friendly and gave us lots suggestions.  Basically, from start to finish, we enjoyed the food, the service and the ambiance."}
{"text":"Miku is one of the best sushi place I have been to. When entering to miku I love the layout of the restaurant. The staff are all very knowledgable and friendly. The sushi tasted very fresh which is very hard to find in the city."}
{"text":"This place is umm-mazing! Think i just made a new word. From the original cocktails, to each piece of delicious sushi brought to the table. It just got better and better. Highly suggested for a date night. Oh did i mention the oysters? Mmm."}
{"text":"Just opened a few weeks ago, was wondering if it's any good even during construction (yes I saw the whole process)!   Gave it a try today and left with a great experience!  The aburi sushi are the stars in this restaurant, a must try!  I had the premium sushi lunch, 12 pieces, the aburi pieces tasted so great that it makes the normal one unattractive.    The sauce and jalapeño on the salmon oshi made a heavenly match. I also like how this aburi method get the oil out of the fish and cover it all on the rice below it.  Some people complain about the oil, in that case they shouldn't have aburi sushi, the whole point is to enjoy that fish oil produced from this technique.   It's a pricy place, however the service, taste of food and overall experience make up to it.  The service is what you get at high end restaurant with energy - Japanese style.  The green tea was $7 for 2 person, it's more expensive because it comes with service, they keep pouring and refilling for us.   Saw other table having very nice display food. Will definitely go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Miku is the go-to spot for premium sushi in Toronto. I came here for my birthday and I got the 5 course Omakase, consisting of sashimi, a variety of seafood (oysters, seared scallop, etc) prime rib, sushi plate, and 3 desserts. While the price is steep, it is very worth it for the experience and expertise of the staff there, which obviously translates over to the food itself. If it is your first time going, I would definitely recommend one of the omakase menus (kind of like a tasting menu!), as you have the chance to sample many of the menu items.   I was pleasantly surprised that the prime rib was so tender, moist, and complementary to the rest of the dishes. I was skeptical at a sushi restaurant's ability to do prime rib well, but not only was the beef amazing, but the side vegetables and wasabi gravy were too!"}
{"text":"This was quite the treat :) I decided to try out this place during the Winterlicious event. I've been wanting to come here to try their regular menu for quite a while, so hopefully, this was a good reflection of the regular menu. I was originally hoping to sample the nigiri, but the torched sushi pieces were quite good too.   I began my meal with the Aburi Sushi Selection, then moved on to the Miso Baked  Sable fish, and I finished off with the Pear Ginger Sorbet. The torched pieces were nice, and my favourite was probably the salmon. I wasn't a big fan of the scallop since there was a good amount of wasabi hidden inside of it. Overall, you get 6 pieces, which I guess would be good as an appetizer. The sable fish came with various sauces and salsas, each with a unique flavour. I tried each bite with a different sauce, and my favourite was probably the chimichurri. The cauliflower fritter was tasty and so was the salad and veggies that came with the dish. Overall, a solid main dish. To finish off my meal, I opted for the sorbet since I'm lactose intolerant. I did, however, have a bite of my friend's Green Tea Opera as well. I loved the sorbet. It had a nice pear flavour with a hint of ginger. The poached pear on the side was delicious and a nice ending to meal. Overall, I enjoyed the simple and clean flavours of my meal.   This place is awfully hard to find an entrance to for some reason. I came out of the subway and I realized that I had to go inside the building next to it to enter. Each entrance was locked, and when I finally opened one, the alarm rang for a few seconds. When I went in, I was immediately greeted and escorted to my seat. I was put in a more private area of the restaurant, so it felt more intimate and peaceful. Everything inside looked very clean and modern. It was simplistic but it complimented the food and the idea of Japanese cuisine overall. It's simplistic yet complex, the environment upgraded the meal experience.   The service was great overall. Our sever was very friendly and very informative. She asked about any allergies or food restrictions, and gave suggestions based off the information. She made us feel welcomed, and she occasionally checked in on our meals. All the servers explained each component of the dishes as they served them.   The only drawback I saw to this was the portion size. I'm a small girl but quite a big eater. I'm usually full by dessert, but I felt hungry right after my meal. It could be that the dishes were so light that I may have needed an extra main dish to satisfy my hunger, but the meal was very enjoyable overall. I think I will try to come back for the regular menu sometime soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant is crazy good. We had the aburi sashimi sampler $28 fo 6 pieces of the chefs daily special and the aburi sashimi both were melt in your mouth delicious. Ordered the sashimi dinner the tuna tartare was sooo good. They also offered to deep fry the shrimp head! Make sure you have room for dessert!!!! Their pastry chef is soo good we went with our servers recommendation for the walnut brownie covered in mochi with tarragon oil and raspberry coulis. Soooooooooo good!! Its expensive and yes we were sorta hungry after but it was a treat and we didnt order a lot with rice mainly nigiri."}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.  Kaisen Soba Peperoncino ($28) To me, this tasted like a seafood pasta but with soba noodles instead. The dish had a lot of ingredients, all fresh seafood so that was good. Came with one jumbo prawn, one scallop, squid, clams, mussels, mushrooms, tomatoes and mixed with arugula. At first I was slightly confused since it seemed like just seafood and salad (the soba was hiding at the bottom). I really liked the soba noodles - the flavors were there, was slightly spicy which I liked. One thing I would comment is the presentation surprisingly did not appeal to me - when served, the clam shells were opened but you can clearly see the clam meat wasn't even inside the shell - displaying empty shells definitely isn't the greatest. Clams and mussels were dry, the scallop was overcooked - kind of disappointed there was only one prawn and one scallop when the menu stated it in plural. All the seafood actually had no taste (wasn't seasoned). You could tell they were cooked separately and just added on top of the noodles. The seafood and noodles combined was a tasty dish altogether.  Miku Roll ($22) Salmon, crab, uni, cucumber, rolled in tobiiko and topped with Miku sauce. I could rarely taste any of the uni. For an 8 piece roll at this price, I would expect to taste a bit more of the ingredients inside, however I found the mayo and Miku sauce overpowering the roll. It was tasty, but nothing special in my opinion.   Miku Signature Sushi selection ($36) Chef's selection of specialty nigiri, roll and oshi sushi  - total of 10 pieces. To be honest I was slightly disappointed with this. For chef's selection and at that price, I must say the selection was weak. I was expecting more high end fish - at least a piece of unagi maybe? Or at least tuna.  Of the 10 pieces, 2 were rolls and 2 were oshi sushi - not impressed. Seabream sushi was my favorite.  The waiter recommended the Miku and Red Wave roll - had I known this signature sushi selection would have a piece of each, I would not have ordered the Miku roll on the side. Fail on the waiter's side as he knew it was our first time here.  Toro sushi (Market price - $10) I love fatty tuna. This was good but I've had better.  Green Tea Opera (13.5) I must say, the dessert was one of the best dishes of the night. It was quite a small piece so quite expensive. I personally really like Opera cakes, so having it green tea flavored was definitely a plus - layers of green tea, matcha cream, dark chocolate, and red bean paste with crunchy bits in the middle, yum. A scoop of Matcha icecream was also served on the side.  Don't get me wrong I did enjoy the meal. However, I would have expected more out of it given it was a restaurant from Vancouver and not to mention the prices were quite steep - slightly disappointed I must say."}
{"text":"Love their fish, nice environment. We went there for winterlicious and the food was totally worth the price. 10/10 will come back again =D"}
{"text":"Come for the Aburi - all else is nice and fresh but not one of a kind. Nice combo special for game days otherwise very expensive. A little snobby. They need better wine by the glass. would return but later"}
{"text":"I went with a few friends for lunch and we ordered kaisen don ($25), sashimi ($27) and premium sushi ($29) from the lunch menu. The fish was fresh and sushi rice was very tasty! However, I was a little disappointed in the presentation of the Kaisen don. I was also expecting to see uni in the premium sushi dish; however, it wasn't there. However, the Sashimi lunch was amazing! Overall, the food quality was pretty good and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Yum yum eat all the food. Not cheap here, but damn it's good. The portions are also small, so this definitely isn't for the ayce sushi crowd. Service isn't anything to write home about, but the place is absolutely gorgeous. Plating and presentation is also tops."}
{"text":"Overall a great experience. Service is top level. Food is pretty good and presentation is good, but a bit pricy.  Salmon oshi aburi: melts in your mouth, not in your hands a must try.  Aburi Sushi sampler: presentation was amazing. Flavour was good.   Saikyo miso baked sablefish: highly recommended by server, it was ok, not too memorable.  Green tea opera: amazing dessert, great mix of crunchy and creamy. Apparently takes 3 days to prepare. Another must try."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for his Birthday.  The decor was very modern and very nice with floor to ceiling glass windows.  Food was great. There was a lot of selection if you're into raw sushi which I'm not that why I gave it a 4 star. My boyfriend however loves sushi so he was loving the food he ordered. Since I only like cooked food I ordered the steak which came on a hot plate with vegetables and cake with rice. We shared edamame as an appetizer and a eel roll. My boyfriend had a variety of sushi as well as the torch sushi. For dessert we had the molten Laval cake it was delicious. The food was great but if you're not a sushi lover this place is not for you.  There's not a lot of options for cooked food. This place is also pricy but the quality is great."}
{"text":"Miku is fantastic, so long as money is no object. Usually I'm not a fan of high-priced small portions, but the food here is so tasty and the ambiance so fantastic, that I decided to still give it 5 stars.  Miku is well above your average sushi/Japanese restaurant, in both quality and style. It's the kind of place you go for special occasions, or to impress, so long as you are willing to splurge. The restaurant is very large, elegant, and bustling with young and hip crowd and the upwardly moving.  We spent $170 for a very light dinner for two, including a $50 bottle of wine. I do believe it belongs in the $$$$ category, even if currently listed at $$$.  The sushi here is of high quality. The fish is super fresh and the rice is outstanding. Every sushi has some sauce inside, and does not call for soy on the side. But, they will be happy to provide soy and wasabe if you request. Every ingredient - down to the ginger and wasabi - is of noticeably high quality.  Here is what we ordered:  Salmon Oshi Shushi Price: $17 Rating: 5/5 This delicious salmon sushi is seared with a blow torch and charcoal and is one of Miku's signature dishes. It contains Miku's special sauce which is a very yummy creamy sauce. A little bit of jalapeno is added for a nice kick.   Red Wave Roll Price: $18 Rating: 5/5 A nice roll of crab with tuna on top is garnished with some pickled shallots.  Miku Signature Sushi Selection Price: $36 Rating: 5/5 Excellent selection of very fresh nigiri sushi with nice sauce integrated inside. My only slight complaint is that the sauce steals a little bit from the delicate taste of the fish, and creates a somewhat uniform flavor so that all pieces taste almost the same.  Kyoto Saikyo Miso Baked Sable Fish Price: $36 Rating: 5/5 Very delicious dish. The fish is perfectly cooked. There are lots of components and flavors to the dish. The highlight is a sauce made from perfectly charred eggplant. You may have noticed that the best way to coax flavor from an eggplant is to char the skin. This technique is used in middle eastern cuisine. At Miku they have perfected the art and the eggplant on this dish is so deliciously smoky, that it must be the best eggplant I've had. The dish is not big, but it's big on flavor.    The alcohol selection is on the expensive side. There is a large offering of high-end Sake. Do not expect to find the warm, cheap-and-cheerful sake you find in other Japanese restaurants. Here they only serve the high quality (read: expensive) stuff, which is a little unfortunate - warm, cheap sake is one of my guilty pleasures... We opted for a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc instead.  The service is profession, if at times hurried. The restaurant is so busy and efficient, that pleasantries are somewhat dispensed with. We sat at the raw bar, to watch the sushi being prepared, and it was sort of nice. But, do not expect to see a sushi master at work. This is not like dining at Hiro sushi. Instead you will find an assembly line of young chefs preparing large quantities of sushi using special tools and techniques for high volume. Still, it was kind of nice.  Overall, a very pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Miku is among the best of the best as far as GTA sushi goes. The dining space was very elegant with a touch of minimalist feel. My group had one of the kaiseki and every course was an artistic arrangement masterfully put together, from the choice of flatware, to how the food was prepared and plated/constructed, except for one dish, perhaps. The prime rib/foie gras with mushrooms, to me, seemed sloppy and paled starkly in comparison to its meticulously constructed sushi counterparts. That's not to say it wasn't mindblowingly delicious; sous vide prime rib had the perfect texture (as expected of sous vide) but was elevated by its accompanying jus/reduction and was the perfect partner for the decadent foie gras. I must've looked dazed as I sat there savouring each morsel. The staff were surprisingly very accommodating, especially in the context of permitting alterations in a kaiseki menu; my friend does not really enjoy raw fish as much as the rest of us and the staff happily made arrangements to modify a course for her. The drinks were very interesting as well, and I hope to come back to better explore their sake offerings. You certainly get what you pay for coming to Miku and I would most definitely recommend it to all sushi lovers."}
{"text":"I am a sushi fanatic. I eat, breathe, live sushi. I can't even tell you how many sushi joints I've been to. And let me just tell you this place was A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.!!! Miku exceeded my expectations and more. This has got to be the best sushi restaurant I have ever been to!   My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner and I I was blown away at the impeccable service and the amazing food. It is on the pricey range, so I do recommend coming here for a special occasion but if you're willing to come here on a regular day and splurge your money on super fresh, complex, great tasting sushi, this is the place to be! If you've never tried their Aburi sushi, do yourself a favour and get it! They flame-torch the sashimi and it gives it an amazing flavour and texture! No soy sauce needed. Everything we ordered we loved! I don't have any complaints!  The waitress was super helpful, she gave us recommendations and also described what was in every plate we ordered. Also the amount of times she changed our \"dirty\" plates was also a plus. She changed our plates 5 times every time a new dish would arrive (there was barely a crumb on our plates). She was also very attentive and super friendly.  The ambiance was also great, definitely perfect for  date nights.   I'll definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Hands down my new favourite restaurant and the BEST sushi I've ever had in my life. My dining experience was an unforgettable experience. I cannot wait to bring my boyfriend here and more of my friends. No sushi restaurant compares to Miku."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews and my love of sushi, I was really optimistic coming to Miku. Had a couple of Aburi's, some room temperature Toro and Sablefish that was highlight. Not sure what the hype is about."}
{"text":"Fine quality sushi. Love the ambience, service, and flatware. The Premium lunch was 12 pieces of sushi, and they were unique and not something you can get in a typical sushi restaurant. It is alright to skip on appetizers if you are having desserts, but they pickle their own cucumbers and root vegetables.  All three desserts we tried (green tea opera, chocolate fondant, pannacotta) were detailed in presentation and interesting in taste and textures.  If reviewers are giving lower reviews because the dining experience was \"different\" and \"unlike\" typical sushi they are visually used to...it's too bad they didn't appreciate that what they're paying for is a unique, better quality, and minutely artistic experiment on food in which \"creativity\" and \"fusion\" is not simply some random slurry of tobiko roe, mayo, and Sriracha sauce squiggly glued on top of rolls."}
{"text":"I have dined here on several occasions, once for summerlicious and twice for my birthday.  This time it was for a friends' birthday--there were three of us and we decided to share our meals.  We decided to start with the Miku Marinated Tofu Salad and this was good, love the tofu and grilled tempeh but nothing outstanding.  We then got the smoked soy grilled octopus with black garlic aioli, chorizo, yuzu saffron quinoa, purple baby carrots and kale.  A lot going on but it was superb in flavour--the only thing I didn't like and the reason of the lack of a star was that the tentacle I had was burnt to a crisp at the tip; beyond \"smoky\".  And at such a luxury restaurant this should have been perfected.  Next up was the Kaisen Soba Peperoncino which was delicious!  Highly recommend!  It was a bowl of prawns, squid, scallop, mussels, chilli garlic soy, sweet pepper, shiitake mushrooms, tomatoes and wild arugula.  You can order this mild and spicy, we had it mild and I had a tiny bowl of chilli flakes on the side.  Then came the Aburi Oshi Sampler where we got to try a piece of Ebi (fresh pressed prawn, lime zest and ume sauce; in my opinion the best one), Saba (house cured mackerel and miso sauce), and Sake (pressed BC wild sockeye salmon, jalapeño, and Miku sauce).  Partially torched sushi is just so good!  Feels like healthy candy   We also go the Miku Roll which was also very delicious--sockeye salmon, crab, cucumber, uni, rolled in tobiko and miku sauce.  This was a fun roll where flavours popped overwhere.  Finally it was the Miku Signature Sushi selection--it was so pretty as it came out lined on a white plate like a showcase of jewels.  I have nothing bad to say only that the sushi here at Miku is just so yummy.  For dessert we ended with the Ichigo Mochi Dome, Jasmine Tea Ice Cream and their special of the day, Grand Marnier and Ginger Ice Cream.  Oh boy, I loved everything!  So so good!  Until next time"}
{"text":"Amazing sashimi platter... each piece melts in your mouth and very fresh fish. The sushi rolls as well are something you must try! Out of this world!"}
{"text":"I'm afraid this place is going downhill. I was there for the restaurant launch and other occasions thereafter and it was great but seems like quality control is lacking now. Yes, I'm picky but only because I know what a decent piece of nigiri should taste like. The rice was off; harder dryer and less flavourful than most places of this price range. The pieces of fish were ok except the ikura... I've never had a piece of sushi drip before! That and the uni had a lingering unpleasant aftertaste. I must admit, I've been spoiled by the tastes in Hokkaido and I don't expect anything that comes close in Toronto but for this price.. com'on! One other thing that annoyed me was the lack of knowledge of the server. Near the entrance of the restaurant, probably not the best tables but surely... he should at least know what's in stock and where the main ingredients come from. Btw... they serve BBQ eel from China... for this kinda restaurant it should not be! Only a few places in Toronto have eel from Japan and you will definitely know the difference. Also they don't have any west coast oysters after i sent him back to ask... luckily one of the supervisors or managers came to save the day. What I will say is that they are still pretty good at customer service (from the senior staff that is)."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Toronto. Never disappoints! Matcha chocolate fondant is the dream. And I love soba with seafood too. Service, location, all 10 out of 10."}
{"text":"I find this place extremely overpriced. It has everything to do with location. Abburi sushi here is their specialty but I've been to other places with equally good food without ha omg to break the bank.  Also you literally torch salmon sushi. Paying the amount they charge for it to kick some flames is not worth the price or hustle."}
{"text":"I don't really eat a lot of Japanese food because my bf doesn't eat sea food at all so if I do have opportunity to eat seafood with friends I am always very excited! I had an early visit at this location back when MIKU Toronto first opened, the food was quite good but service was bit slow. I wrote a honest review n MIKU management actually contacted me directly to come back for a revisit even emailed/called me to personally apologized and thanking me for helping them to improve service. I was impressed and very excited to come back.   Me and my friends came back for lunch, she actually brought her 2 year old son this time :) hah the seating is quit comfortable we requested to change table for the toddler they disnt hesitate at all :):) My friend's son was playing with a table setting n dropped it on the floor. The passer by waiter who wasn't even for my table was aware of it n said no need to pick up from floor. Instead he gave us a new one.  Our waitress was very attentive and very warm. She was very helpful . We were looking for an dinner item at MIKU , they didn't have it for lunch but they totally bent it backwards n made accommodation to make that dish for us anyway.   The dishes we ordered were Totally delicious! We got fish and chips, and calamari tempura for starters. They were the BEST fish and chips and fried calamaris I have had! The fish came in small pieces two-bites-size I can tell they were NOT frozen fish by their texture. The batter was light golden n fluffy . Very moist bitting into. It came with Thin slices yam chips! I was thinking even if my bad didn't like fish, if we order this dish he could dig on sweet potato chips. My friend's tod loved the yam he pretty much ate all the rest :):) you also get quite a few pieces too 3 of us were able to get at least 2 pieces each person. Unlike some Japanese food u get very tinny serving . The calamari had tinny sea weed pieces in the batter. When the word \"seaweed\" might sound scary to some people in the batter, if you r open mind please give it a chance. It's very tinny amount and does not over power whole flavour of calamari at all. It's drizzled by some other brown sweet savoury sauce. So good I can eat this all day!   We also ordered the 12 pieces Shoshi that each piece were diff kind of their own ,and the samon sushi. The samon were lightly seared n raw under so you have two kinds of texture biting into. The rice came with sushi is well seasoned/flavoured . They have the most delicious sushi I have had. U do not need to dip soy sauce or other stuff.   We also ordered baked muscles that came with bacon and Russell sprouts also seasoned in garlic and n flavoured dipping olive oil  . So good.  Over all I love the atmosphere of this place . It's very warm and inviting. I came before for dinner, this time I came for lunch. The lunch is quite nice since they have high ceiling and all glass window u get quite exposure of sun light for a winter season , any extra sun adds coziness :)  I am very satisfied with the food and service here . They present the true culture of Japanese food at the same time they are very Canadian. I also like the uniforms of employees that they wear well fitted white shirt/tie/vest. Even our waitress her outfit actually looked good on her. Kinda sick of some places like Earls or KEG have waitstaff wearing short skirts or Joey wearing cocktail dress. That I can imagine they can make ladies slightly older or kids feel uncomfortable . This place seems more upscale and more friendly towards all ages. Even my friend brought her 2 yr old son it was fine. It's obviously for adults but don't restate to bring ur little one for a lunch treat at Lake front :)    Expecting for about $35 plus tax n tip for lunch. I am very happy with the food n service. I think you do pay for better Japanese food than average sushi joint! Their stuff is much better seasoned , much Freshier. And the food is packed in flavour ! Each single piece of sushi is individually seasoned in perfection in meat and rice separately. Takes a lot of work making just one plate. And the rice was warm when served which is little but important detail. I'd love to come back soon in the near future and I totally recommend  this place to others :) Japanese culture present a lot of meticulous work in arts n food. This place u can totally experience that if u love seafood :) Hope they have more items for such as beef and chicken for non seafood eaters in the future so if ppl are going for a date ,the ppl don't eat seafood can find something to share . But if you are sushi fan u this place will ruin the rest sushi places for u(in a good way ) hah."}
{"text":"Good service, but the food is just average...  don't get ur expectations too high b4 u come here..  ordered seafood platter & Their signature aburi sushi & sashimi, MEDIOCRE.. I don't think you get what u pay for, but again, service was very good"}
{"text":"If you know anyone who's visited Vancouver in the past few years and they rave about a particular sushi restaurant, this is it. Miku's come to Toronto and its a welcome addition to the food scene. Predictably, the food is excellent. Alot of variety on the menu, great atmosphere and all around incredibly friendly staff. Unfortunately this is one of those sushi restaurants you have to throw alot of money at to get the good stuff, but thats typical of high end sushi restaurants. Personally I'm more of a fan of JaBistro, as I find the quality of fish there typically edges out Miku despite the two establishments being more or less on par in terms of pricing. But its a small criticism as the sushi here is in the top tier in Toronto. Most high end sushi restaurants have limited seating but Miku is the exception, plenty of seating so there's no major concern with reservations unless you have a large party.  The matcha lava cake dessert is a crowd pleaser and makes matcha fans go rabid with excitement when the plate gets dropped on their table. There's no shame in licking the plate clean, its that good (if your a matcha fan)."}
{"text":"This review is way overdue as I went to Miku months ago. I actually have not been back because while it was a good meal I was underwhelmed. I had heard rave reviews about it so maybe my expectations were too high. The restaurant decor is upscale and the prices are accordingly high.   Pan Seared Scallops - nicely plated, but very average  Aburi Oshi Sampler - good, but again nothing out of the ordinary. I prefer the aburi sushi at Jabistro.  Sashimi - had the sockeye salmon and amberjack, which were both quite fresh  Roseberries with Foamed Tofu Tiramisu - this dessert was actually the highlight of my meal, although I think the dessert menu has changed. The tofu tiramisu melted in my mouth and had flavours of raspberry, rosewater, and strawberry. The toasted edamame and raspberry lady fingers also added to a rich flavour palate. If they still have this on the menu I highly recommend it!  Salted caramel ice cream - good, but forgettable in comparison to the dessert above"}
{"text":"The environment is very good for dating, and the service is definitely above the average, so I give a high fee. For food, however, is mediocre, especially for sushi and dessert. The grilled seafood did give me some surprise, but the sushi does not deserve the price. If you want to find a quite place to eat and relax, it is a good choice. If you want to try some delicious or creative Japanese food, it may disappoint you."}
{"text":"3.5 star  Winterlicious 2017 Experience  Maybe I been drooling over all the yummy photos online and 5 star review on Yelp. I came with a high expectation. The winterlicious lunch option was great value which worth a 4 star +. But the food itself did not wow me.   Miku Zen,  Signature Aburi Sushi,  Green Tea Opera.  That's a lot of food for $28.   Overall it was enjoyable and I do love the Green Tea Opera.  Service was courteous and quite attentive.  I think for a full Miku experience, one needs to come here for an actual lunch/dinner. I am open for a return visit."}
{"text":"absolutely love it!!! the food is very delicious and the service is very good."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great service!  Their scallops are to die for! My favourite sushi spot so far"}
{"text":"Having lived in Japan and taken a sushi class as part of my culinary education, I know good sushi.  The smell, the taste, the feel--it's all part of the equation. Having been to Miku, I now know that top notch sushi exists in Toronto.   My brother suggested grabbing dinner here prior to a show at the ACC--the location was a stone's throw from the venue (even though it's in prime tourist zone) and we both wanted to try it. Getting into the actual restaurant was a challenge since it is located in an office building and the main doors lock to outsiders after 6:30 p.m. As I walked around outside, peering through the glass at all the happy diners--perplexed as to why I couldn't get in--I couldn't help but wonder if this was intentional. Wouldn't it make sense to place a staff member at the main doors of the office building for an optimal guest experience? Many other diners had the same issue. Although this was a minor inconvenience, the food and service made up for it.   Walking into the restaurant felt authentically Japanese. By that, I mean we were pelted with the phrase \"irasshaimase!\", which means \"welcome.\" As we were led to our table at the front, we walked through the open kitchen area and bar space, which would be a great spot perch on a chair, grab a \"biru\" and people watch.   The service, from end to end, was impeccable. Numerous servers led us through our Miku dining journey and all were extremely knowledgeable and consistent. To test this out, I asked two different servers where the beef in the carpaccio is sourced from. They both answered my question without hesitation and gave the exact same answer.   As for our meal, we shared five different plates. All were a contemporary twist on traditional Japanese cuisine. The menu was a balanced combination of sushi, sashimi, and creative dishes with unique ingredients. Miku is known for its flame grilled aburi sushi. We ordered the salmon aburi, which was torched wild BC sockeye salmon that was elegantly encased in a square of rice. The rice had been soaked in a signature Miku sauce and, if that wasn't enough, it was garnished with a dainty slice of jalapeño, which balanced the fattiness of the salmon and added a pop of colour to the rice-white backdrop. I am still thinking about this dish hours later (hmm, I wonder if they deliver on Uber Eats...).    A close second for me was the sablefish entree. This was a standout because it tasted even better than it appeared, and I rarely say this. It was plated with eggplant purée, pattypan squash, charred daikon and a vibrant sprinkling of steamed edamame. We also ordered the red wave roll, Miku roll and beef carpaccio. All dishes arrived promptly (maybe a little too quickly) and were explained in detail. The rolls were good, but a bit bland (ask for a side of soy sauce to punch up the flavour). I would have much rather enjoyed a second plate of aburi. Although I was tempted to try the matcha opera cake for a sweet finish, I was feeling satisfied.   Miku was an overall pleasant experience for the palate. Although prices are a bit steep, the aburi will keep me coming back because it's so damn \"oishii\"!"}
{"text":"I first heard of Miku when I was visiting Vancouver last year, but wasn't able to try it there because the wait time was about an hour and a half. Naturally when I heard they were opening a location in Toronto, I got very excited and dragged my parents there to try it with me (and so they could foot the bill :P)  We came on a Wednesday evening pretty late (around 7:30 or 8 PM) without reservations, and luckily didn't even have to wait for a seat.   One standout thing I will note about Miku right off the bat is the level of service here. The staff are incredibly attentive, and each time they bring out a dish they will explain it thoroughly to you and describe all the ingredients in it. It was particularly impressive in our case, because one of the things we ordered was the Miku Signature Sushi Selection, which came with 10 completely different pieces of sushi. Our main waiter also did a phenomenal job of checking up on us periodically, chatting with us, answering our (mostly my) questions, and generally making sure we were happy and satisfied. It also helped that he was cute ;)  In terms of the food, I particularly enjoyed the Miku Signature Sushi Selection, and honestly I wouldn't mind just ordering this for myself because of all the variety. All of the sushi are seared/blowtorched, and if you haven't tried anything like that before, then let me tell you... you have to. The slightly warm sushi ends up being incredibly creamy in texture, and it is super flavourful and delicious.  Other items we ordered:  Miku Roll - This is one of their blowtorched rolls (8 pcs.) which includes salmon, crab, uni, cucumber, tobiko, and Miku sauce. You also get one of these in the signature sushi selection, described above. Quite delicious, I enjoyed this a lot, as I did with all of the torched sushi.  Sashimi - 6 pieces of atlantic salmon and 6 pieces of bluefin tuna (I think). The sashimi came arranged very attractively in this big bowl thing and also tasted fresh, but to be honest it wasn't anything that was amazing. It comes with two types of soy sauce (sweet and normal), but to be honest the difference between the two of them was very slight.  Dessert - ordered their famous green tea opera cake, which according to our waiter takes 3 days to prepare because it is made up of seven unique layers (green tea, chocolate, hazelnut, red bean, etc.) It came as two small rectangular slices, a scoop of matcha ice cream, and a very thin sesame wafer thing. I enjoyed it and appreciated the artistry of the presentation and obviously the skill and effort required to make the dessert, but at the same time thought it was pretty pricey ($13.50) for such a small portion.   Miku is a beautiful restaurant, and I would absolutely come again for the delicious food and stellar service. The amount of food we ordered was sufficient for 3 people - we were satisfied but not grossly full. The bill can rack up pretty quickly, so I wouldn't make it a regular thing, but it's nice for a special occasion or if you just feel like treating yourself."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Sushi places in the Toronto Area.  Every piece of sushi and sashimi we had was fresh and very high quality.  Service was excellent as the waiters described every every dish before we ordered and after it arrived.  Along with our meal, we ordered the Warm Valrhona Matcha Chocolate Fondant.  OMG, this is the best molten lava cake I had.  The cake was perfectly baked while the matcha/chocolate center oozed out as we dug in. It was paired with a jasmine tea ice cream that greatly complements the lava cake.  If you're a fan of chocolate, I definitely recommend ordering this after your meal."}
{"text":"Ive been to Miku on many occasions, 2 winterlicious and 1 omakase, and I just have to say this place have never disappointed me. The service is meticulous, they'll tailor any dish according to your needs (allergies etc). I frequent this place with a friend who is allergic to certain types of nuts, and every time we come the servers are sure to address this issue. This time even the floor manager came over to explain and ensure that her food is nut free, readjusting any dish to fit the criteria.  For the winterlicious menu, I ordered aburi sushi selection, bacon wrapped beef tenderloin with pan seared foie gras, and tofu tiramisu. The aburi sushi is by far my fav thing to order from Miku, especially the salmon aburi sushi. Its just so flavourful, and then whole thing just melts within your mouth as you chew. The beef tenderloin was good as well. Meat was juicy and flavourful, but I dont think I have the taste buds to appreciate the fattiness of the foie gras. With the entree, they included an entire pan fried liver; it was delicious but the quantity was a little too heavy for me. If you like foie gras, you'd love this dish. The tofu tiramisu was such a great choice to finish off the meal. As weird as it sounds, it was delicious; not too sweet and not too heavy.   Overall I'd say this place is by far one of the best places for sushi and japanese inspired dishes. You cant go wrong."}
{"text":"I visited Miku a while back for Winterlicious ($28). I had high expectations for Miku, unfortunately, it missed the mark. It felt very much like a manufacturing line. It lacks the attention to details one would expect from high end Japanese restaurants.   First course: Miso soup + Sashimi platter Chef's Selection  The quality of the tuna was subpar. The texture was not smooth and felt like it was handled many times. It also lacked the freshness.   Second course: Signature aburi sushi plate Two nigiris, two pieces of maki rolls and two of their torched oshi sushi  The dish came with two different types of soy sauce, one with a sweeter undertone and the other is more savory. The sushi rice harden and the sushi, unfortunately, fell apart the moment they were picked up.   Dessert: Green Tea opera cake The Green tea opera cake  took 10 minutes to arrive. Green tea sponge cake, matcha buttercream, dark chocolate ganache, adzuki bean cream with hazelnut wafer and matcha ice cream. I love the interplay of textures. However, the time it took for it to arrive was unacceptable.   While I appreciated the presentation, I did not enjoy the meal. Overall, it is far below the other Japanese restaurant of its class."}
{"text":"Overall this restaurant is OK - The food is better than going to an All You Can Eat sushi establishment, however it is definitely not as good as Ja Bistro.   We had:  Carpaccio: 6/10- the beef was flavourless and the sauces it came with were bland to salty. The presentation was great. Maybe I prefer carpaccio from italian restaurants.  Sashimi appetizer: 7/10- 8 pieces of 4 different fish. The toppings were different and something like I have never tried before. There was more flavor than your typical sashimi. However consistent with the rest of the fish here, their fish is very bland and definitely not top of the line.  Blowtorched Sushi: 8/10- you cant go wrong with any blowtorched sushi so I am giving it an 8, however the rice was very cold and the fish was warm.   Miku roll: 8/10- Loved the creaminess of this roll however again the temperature of this roll was off. All of the food tastes like it was sitting, waiting to be delivered to the table for too long.   Service is 10/10. No complaints. Very friendly and always came around at the right times.   Bathrooms: 9/10: Clean and good lighting. The tap water is cold and cannot go to warm. Was surprised that their were only 2 stalls for such a big establishment.   Overall rating: 7/10"}
{"text":"My fiancee ordered the kaiseki, and I got the red wave roll, pan seared scallops and two pieces of ootoro sushi.   The red wave roll was one of my favourite dishes of the meal. I liked it much more with the soy sauce though even though they said it wasn't necessary. The ootoro sushi was ten bucks a piece, and I hadn't had it before since it's so expensive. I think it was worth to try once. It was buttery soft and just delicious but I'm not sure it was worth 10 bucks a piece. The only dish I got that I didn't find great was the pan seared scallops. They were huge, but the flavouring was a bit off. It tasted much better with the miso bacon marmalade spread on top of it.  From the kaiseki that we shared, there was some raw seafood platter that I thought was alright. It wasn't my thing maybe. The prime rib entree was amazing. I usually don't even like prime rib. Out of the aburi sushi I got to try, the ebi sushi was the only one that I thought was delicious. And finally my favourite part of the kaiseki- the green tea opera dessert. Holy moly this is the best dessert I've ever had anywhere.  Aside from that, the service was great and the atmosphere too. Aside from the numerous fruit flies that were in the area."}
{"text":"Love it.   Some people say Jabistro is better. To be honest, if you really have to pick one, maybe yes Jabistro #1 Miku #2. But both are great and close enough in food quality. In addition, Miku has a brighter and more spacious environment. So Miku still wins me."}
{"text":"Had their tasting menu here. Definitely recommend my favourite was the seared salmon with jalapeño on top. So good"}
{"text":"Been to the Vancouver location but finally got to try the Toronto location for Winterlicious lunch!   Our reservation was at 1 but we had to wait 10 minutes which kinda ticked us off because we only had ~1 hour for our lunch break... so much for reservations....but the food and service quickly made up for it.   I started out with miso soup and the Miku zen. It was quite a big portion and I was pretty much already full after I was done. Everything was super yummy though! The tofu salad was really good and the beef was fall apart in your mouth soft. For my main I got the aburi sushi which you got to sample a couple of their aburis. Everything was really flavourful and high quality. For dessert, their green tea opera cake was delicious... loved the crunchy layer in between the cake! Tried my friends tiramisu which was really interesting because there was a hint of tofu to it.   Overall, definitely a good Winterlicious experience!"}
{"text":"Maybe lunch isn't the best time to come to Miku?  Hubby and I decided last minute to stop in here for a late-ish lunch.  It was mostly empty (it's a pretty big restaurant) and got ourselves a window-side table.  Someone took our drink order and disappeared.  The drink was delivered by someone else.  It was a pretty pristine (though not hugely creative) take of a mojito using shiso instead of mint.  It took a while longer for someone to come by (someone different) to take our order.  Seemed like a nice guy.  I ended up ordering the \"DELUXE\" version of their Miku Zen bento/kaiseki set.  It wasn't on the menu but I guess you got a couple more \"side dishes\" as the guy described.  As hubby usually does, he upstages me with a much more humble order of the Kaisen Soba Peperoncino.   As it turns out, I preferred his dish over much of mine.  With regard to mine, the sashimi, grilled salmon, salad and oyster were good.  Everything else (the kale gomae, tuna tartare and beef tenderloins wrapped in bacon) were ok to below average.  The tuna tartare was fishier than I like but I decided to choke it down because I was paying good money. Kale gomae was flavorless and the beef was cold.  I actually liked the barley underneath better.   The few pieces of sushi that came with the meal actually saved the entire lunch for me as far as the savory program was concerned.  I'm glad I left those for last.  For dessert, I got the small portion of the opera cake.  They made a big deal out of telling us how long it took to make due to all the layers.  It tasted good but hardly worth all the fanfare!  What was more delicious was the mochi bomb which was basically a dessert enrobed in a sheet of mochi.  So delicious.  Probably my favorite thing that lunch and I'm not even a dessert person.  Nice lunch.  Spot is a little ways away where we had been normally hanging out so we may have second thoughts about coming back.  Maybe we'll check out the one in Vancouver next time."}
{"text":"Service: The service is pretty good, as the server will explain the menu items to you and give you suggestions.  Ambiance: The decor is nice and modern, but the view compared to the Miku in Vancouver is just not the same.  Food: The sushi and dishes are good, but I feel it's a bit on the expensive considering the portion size and what you are getting. I would recommend trying this place, if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Oops! Came here last week and I totally forgot to review this place, but anyways.   This place is super talked about in Toronto right now and even going in there on a Thursday night, it was packed to the point where they only have the tall tables. I was celebrating something so I wasn't afraid to splurge a little, which is what I did! We started out with some appetizers - we split the Kale Goma-ae, which is like a kale salad but where the kale has been cooked, which was really good. We also tried one of each of the vegetable nigiri, which were AMAZING - honestly I almost wish I got double and just made it my full meal! For my actual entree though, I got the Garden Roll, which I personally didn't like as much as I was hoping due to the excess amount of asparagus - that's my own opinion personally, that I don't really like asparagus in sushi as it is, so I was a little disappointed. I also got two (oops!) of the Rose French 75 drinks which was literally AMAZING - it was so cute and it tasted absolutely amazing!  Honestly, if I came back, I'd probably treat this place more as a bar and snack on Nigiri while I drank. I do wish I tried some desserts though, as looking at the pictures online it looks really good! Next time I get a big paycheck for sure!"}
{"text":"Best. Sushi. I've. Ever. Had.   The service was incredibly friendly and timing was on point.   The atmosphere was casual and the setting of the dinner is like formal but not TOO formal, it's dim but not too dark or bright. And there's perfect amount of space between each table to allow for intimate dinner conversation but yet it's not silent because there's still a background noise.   But the star of the show is probably the Sushi. We ordered momo (peach sake), the sake flight, the seaweed salad, the Miku sushi and red roll sushi, and the chefs recommendations for sushi. As well as the matcha fondue for dessert. The momo was DE-LICIOUS, so much so that I should have ordered more. The seaweed salad was very unique because it's not the type of seaweed you'd get in normal sushi restaurants - it's legit seaweed. The Miku sushi had to be my favorite, there's very little rice and it literally melts in your mouth with all the unique flavours. The matcha fondue is also delicious, it has just the right amount of matcha flavour that's not overwhelming and the lava cake...YUM.   What made it 5 stars is also how they remembered to put the happy birthday message on the cake without any prompting. It was the perfect end to a lovely dinner. Yes it was on the expensive side but it's totally worth it as a treat to yourself or a special occasion.   Bonus: they don't rush you out, they give you plenty of time at the restaurant. We stayed there for probably 3.5 hours."}
{"text":"Lovely service, good spaced-out layout kept the meal private while still feeling connected as part of a restaurant. Torched sushi is fresh and the flavours emulsified by the delicious Japanese rice - nice even consistency and texture. Attention is always put in the plating of dishes here; especially the matcha opera with interesting takes of hazelnut cake, ice cream and macaron which are all green tea flavoured. Great for special occasions!"}
{"text":"Service was great. The sushi, on the other hand, not so great. I would even go as far to say awful. The omakase was a waste of money. Of the 10 pieces of nigiri, I may have enjoyed 1. After dining at top sushi restaurants like Nakazawa and Morimoto, I had high hopes for this place. But I was only disappointed with the lack of simplicity and lack of distinction of flavors, besides the wasabi which overpowered most other flavors."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly service, generous portion sizes, and delicious food.   I had the Shokai set menu ($75 per person) which consisted of 4 courses. Highlights for the appetizer were the oyster, scallop, and tuna. I chose the sablefish as my entree and it was delicious. Ordered the o toro separately and that was amazing as well. The sushi rice was made well and dessert was nice and light. Overall, very happy with my experience at Miku.  Taste:  4.5/5 Service: 5/5 Atmosphere: 5/5 Value for Money: 5/5 Would I come again: Yes!"}
{"text":"My wife and I brought my buddy here for his birthday dinner and this place was simply amazing. We ordered the tasting menu (CAD 98) and it was 5 courses:  1) Sashimi appetizer 2) 3 Different appetizers incl. oyster, octopus etc etc 3) Sushi 4) Prime Rib w/ wasabi horseradish 5) a variety of desserts  it was all amazing and i'd come again anyday if budget wasn't an issue! In addition to the tasting menu's we got two small bottles of Sakura Desai (480ml), approx 48 CAD a bottle. a really smooth sake and perfect w/ our meal."}
{"text":"Best sashimi/sushi restaurant in downtown. They are known for their Oshi sushi, and our favorite is the Salmon Oshi Sushi. They're extremely tasty, definitely the best Oshi Sushi in town. Sashimi is always fresh, perfect to pair with their sweet soy sauce. One of the very few 5 star restaurants for me."}
{"text":"Over the top service and such generous portions !!! I was excited to try their $150.00 kaiseki 5 course dinner which is very reasonably priced considering the amount of attention to detail and  expensive ingredients involved. I had planned this as part of my culinary vacation after extensive research and was very pleasantly pleased.  From the moment I walked in I was welcomed by the entire FOH staff. Upon sitting at the bar I was presented with a greeting card welcoming me to their establishment. ( nice touch ) I had a full tour of the restaurant with each course from the bar to the exhibition kitchen to the sushi bar. The executive chef brought each course himself and explained the ingredients in detail. Every dish was beautifully presented in exquisite authentic Japanese chinaware and tasted heavenly. My server Morgan and my bartender Mike were perfect with their timing and pairing of sake and wine with each dish. And the mochi dome dessert is to die for. I loved it so much I went back just to have it again before leaving Toronto. So long for now. I will be back !!!"}
{"text":"Weekday lunch.  Food was high quality.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great location, food, and service. We had the Miku Kaiseki and everything was great (especially the dessert) although my girlfriend had a slight issue with one dish. Definitely a strong option for Japanese food in Toronto."}
{"text":"We went for a quick dinner pre concert at the ACC. First let me say our server was fantastic. Wish I got his name to give him accolades.  While I agree with others that the food is a bit pricey this is not your average sushi place.  The restaurant itself is huge, beautiful and elegant and menu items are unique and beautifully presented.  We shared the seaweed salad, roasted brussel sprouts (yum!) and two sushi.  Tastiest for us were the salmon oshi sushi and the ebi oshi sushi.  Now if they would only have a north location would be great."}
{"text":"I went to Miku in Vancouver recently and was blown away by their aburi sushi. I was ecstatic to learn that they are opening a location in Toronto! I took my mother there for her birthday dinner.  We ordered a couple of things to share - the Miku signature sushi selection ($36), the salmon abrui oishi sushi ($17), beef carpaccio ($19), hamachi sashimi ($17), miso-baked sablefish ($35) and crispy brussels sprouts ($9) as a side.   The sushi are definitely my favourite. The Miku signature sushi selection was beautifully plated, and the fish was fresh and melt in your mouth. Out of everything I tried on the plate, the only one I didn't like was the garden roll. Everything else was delicious- the aburi really brings out the fattiness of the fish!  In contrast to the sushi, I wasn't as big of a fan of the cooked items. The miso-baked sablefish was quite enjoyable, but I was a little put off by the grey colour of charred eggplant puree.  Miku is definitely a bit of a splurge but highly recommended for a special occasion. Of course, it's missing the wonderful ocean view that the Vancouver location has. But given that Vancouver is thousands of miles away, this is a pretty good option for fine dining sushi."}
{"text":"Everything is super fresh, service was great! Love the Aburi sushi and the seafood platter. A great twists on the traditional Japanese sushi."}
{"text":"Pretty flavorful sushi. All in that one little bite (or two bites full). They definitely put care into what they make and the flavors packed into it. Buttery and melt in your mouthfuls.  I like that they say that you do not really need any of the soy sauce at all because there is so much flavor in it.  Simple looking but just the right amount of complexity to taste really good.  I hear it is pricey but well worth it.  Good service. Went here for lunch on the weekend."}
{"text":"The only reason This place got a star  is because of the waiter. He was friendly! Perhaps we didn't order the right things or perhaps we got spoiled by the freshness of everything in LA. We,however, did take the recommendation from our waiter since we are not Locals. -Grilled octopus: $21-- we got 4 small pieces.mediocre  - Lobster entree : $59--- boring and not fresh.overall tasteless!  - house special seafood soup Boullabasses: tasteless -Shiso Mojito: $14 very bitter and sour - Martini: good -Miyazaki #2: taste like cough medicine. Nasty! Flies in the drink. With the price,we honestly expected better. Food should be better in term  of flavor and freshness."}
{"text":"Love this place. Very professional, spacious, modern interior. The sashimi is always presented beautifully and quality is amazing. We came here again for the Winterlicious menu and it certainly didn't disappoint! Very similar to Jabistro and their Aburi sushi is to die for. Literally just melts in your mouth with flavour.   The only con is it's hard to find parking there as it is in the heart of dt.   Customer service is amazing. The waiter spilled a drink next to our table and it splashed on my coat and scarf. They immediately got a wet cloth to help me clean it, and the manager got involved bringing some soda water to help wth removing any stains on the scarf. I appreciate them trying to make it right and it left me with a very positive view of the restaurant team.   Would definitely come again to try their set courses."}
{"text":"If you are looking to go balls to the wall on sushi in Toronto this is the place!! I suggest watching Giro Dreams of Sushi on Netflix and then heading to Miku to have the freshest, most perfectly formed bites of sushi your mouth has ever had. Definitely sit at the bar if you can so that you can watch the sushi chefs put TLC into each and every piece. Is it expensive? Of course it is. This is not some run of the mill AYCE joint! Miku is all about quality and class. You will never stop dreaming of Miku! For reals."}
{"text":"This is a review for 2018 winterlicious dinner menu. Service: 5/5 Food taste: 4/5 Portion: incredibly small Price: incredibly expensive. 53/person before tax and tip, 60 after tax. I don't really recommend to have winterlicious here.  A group of us came to this restaurant for winterlicious, I don't think any of us was full after the meal. I ask the waitress what are the most popular dish and ordered exactly that: signature Aburi platter for starter, sablefish and lobster tail for main, green tea opera for dessert. The portion was really small. For the sushi platter, it tasted really good, however, only 6 pieces of sushi. For the main course, the lobster tail is raw. The sablefish was tender and juicy, however, small. The dessert was good and small. I can't believe I just spent over 60 only this small meal. In my opinion, I did not get a good deal on this year's winterlicious menu."}
{"text":"Expensive but amazing pressed and torched sushi. My absolute favourite sushi spot in Toronto . The Miku roll, salmon pressed sushi, and the seafood sampler is a must here"}
{"text":"At first I super loved Miku, but now I find their quality to be lower ... The aburi sushi has the teeeeeeniest tiny little piece of fish and then a load of mayo."}
{"text":"This reviewed is based on first visit to Miku.  ATMOSPHERE: A large and expansive space. Love the range of seating, from giant booths to bar. It is good for parties, or intimate gatherings.   SERVICE: Excellent. Host at front door was lovely, responded right away, and ushered me to my table (my friend had arrived already). And was eager to stow my coat for me.  Our table wait staff was courteous and attentive. Gave us space to talk and dine - but regularly checked in on us. She was also very knowledgeable. It was our first time there - and she handled our (many) questions with patience and provided informative suggestions. All staff had a perfect mix of speed in service, and offered space for us to enjoy our time there.   PRICE: Not inexpensive - definitely a pricier choice in the city. Price point is appropriate for special occasions, or any meeting meant to impress your guests.   FOOD: All was good. My friend and I were comparing it a lot to JaBistro - as we are big fans & they are the Aburi King in our experience. So, apologies if the following brings up comparisons to mainly JaBistro...   1. Sashimi Platter: Excellent presentation. Everything was delicious. Good to share between 2 people. Kudos to our wait staff for pointing out the option to have our ebi (shrimp) head and tails to be taken back to the kitchen to be fried - hence offering an additional way to eat the ebi. This was much enjoyed.  2. Aburi Oshi Sushi (half orders of mackerel and prawn): Good but not the melt-in-your-mouth Aburi Oshi from JaBistro... Next time, I want to sample other types aburi. But for this first try - I wasn't as impressed...  3. Green Tea Opera: Perhaps the most surprising dish. Beautiful presentation. But the flavours blew me away. I was expecting overwhelming sweetness and green tea flavour - but it was actually well-balanced and tasted like a ferrero rocher with green tea weaved through it. The roasted sesame cracker was AMAZING. (I'm a huge fan of sesame - and this piece was perfect). Also, it provided a wonderful range of textures.   Definitely want to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Tried their sample aburis at taste of Toronto and it was amazing so had to come. Then didn't go yet but my boss went to Vancouver and went to their location there and told me to go. So finally I went. Food was pretty good but just short of excellent. The aburis didn't taste as good as I remember from the taste of Toronto event but still good. My friend and I shared the 4 course meal and had a 6-piece salmon aburi and us two tiny Asian girls were full. (We didn't go with 5 course meal bcos the main was fixed to prime ribs and I'm here for seafood! The 4 course option you can choose your main dish) The first course of seafood platter was good love the different sauces on each item. The only thing not a fan of was the oysters ...they just had some not good ones (and trust me I've had my share of oysters coast to coast and in other continents too). The most interesting thing was the tuna and foie gras...I'm usually not a fan of fried foie gras but OMG WHAT why was it so good? Almost ditched the tuna and just ate the foie gras. The seasoned...I wanna say quinoa but it was couscous? Something like that anyway that tasted so good! The sushi rolls platter was ok not as exciting as I would think but still yummy. Dessert I wasn't the biggest fan but hey they wrote Happy Birthday on it (it was my actual bday) so I'm down. The service was excellent that's something that makes this place great. One tiny thing is so they have these nice Japanese ladies bringing out the food but I'm not gonna lie when they were explaining each plate I had no idea what they said bcos of their accent plus complexity of the items...either way I would totally go back again to try other stuff (but not soon...like good enough to go back but not good enough to hurry back) but wished the aburi was as excellent as I tried at taste of Toronto next time!"}
{"text":"We had the octopus for appetizer, sablefish and oshi sushi for main and chocolate matcha dessert. 10 out of 10 for presentation and creativity. I felt everything was a little overpriced. Each dish was very balanced. The sablefish was delicious and very well cooked. The eggplant purée at the bottom of the fish was very unique and amazing. The dessert was our favourite. It had all the textural elements to make a well balanced and perfect dessert. The cake was warm and rich and the ice cream had a subtle taste to go along with it. The matcha powder disappeared soon as it touched the tongue. The jelly and fresh fruit were perfect accompaniments and the red syrup was a great tart addition.  There was a long wait between dishes. We were seated at 7:30 and dessert came at 9. It was also full on a Tuesday night so don't go without reservations even on weekdays!"}
{"text":"After hearing so much about Miku this past year, I finally went on a Saturday night to try their Japanese food for a special occasion. Originally from Vancouver, this busy restaurant is right by Bay and Queens Quay and is only accessible from the inside (so you must enter through the office building to get to the entrance of the restaurant). The decor and interior of the restaurant is very chic, minimal, and clean. As you walk by the sushi bar and kitchen, you can see the many many cooks/chefs preparing the dishes.   I had previously tried their famous aburi style sushi at Taste of Toronto this year and found it quite similar to Jabistro. Nonetheless, I was excited to finally try their other dishes and food to see what all the hype was all about. I wasn't disappointed.  Highlights from the meal:  Aburi Oshi Sushi - This is a must get if you come here. My party ordered all 3 (salmon, ebi, and mackerel) and the way they blowtorch the sushi with the sauces they use...amazing. Each sushi dish comes with 6 pieces. Definitely one of the highlights as all the flavour combinations worked perfectly.   Miku roll - This roll...literally melts in your mouth it's so good. I don't know what kind of special Miku sauce they put on it but it's delicious. All I can say is...order it!  Green tea opera - I had wanted to try this signature dessert for a long time. It is beautifully presented and so instagram-worthy. I didn't know what to expect when I ordered it but...when it came...I stared at the pretty presentation...then took a bite. I literally almost cried tears of deliciousness because all the contrasting textures and flavours worked so well together. The crunchiness from the hazelnut wafer complimented the matcha butter cream and adzuki bean cream perfectly. I love desserts and this one blew me out of the water...a must get if you go to Miku.   Jasmine ice cream - I tried this because my party also ordered the Valrhona Matcha Chocolate Fondant. Wow...the jasmine tea flavour was incredible and the waiter mentioned that all the ice creams and sorbets are made in house. I wish they sold this stuff in tubs so I can just buy some to take home. Delicious.   All the Miku desserts are amazing....you rarely find that restaurants do great desserts...Miku is an exception. Save room to get dessert if you plan on coming here. It is the perfect ending to a meal you expect from a great restaurant.    Other dishes we ordered:  Aburi Sashimi - Beautiful presentation. The scallops in this dish were very fresh.  Spicy steamed edamame - Quite unique and there is a bit of a kick to it.  Miso marinated tofu salad - The dressing is quite delicious! Good appetizer if you want some veggies.   Miku signature bouillabaisse - Got the regular size but the amount of seafood in the stew is incredible. There was black cod (so buttery and good), shrimp, calamari, potatoes, and mussels (at least 10). Also came with garlic toast.  Rest of my party ordered the Kaisen soba peperoncino, prime rib (very tender and cooked to perfection), and the sablefish. Overall, generous portions for the mains with the price you pay.   Quite interested in their tasting menus if I ever decide to come back. Miku is pretty pricey in general and it is a place I would go to again for special occasions."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi experiences I've ever had! Price-wise, Miku sits somewhere towards the higher end, however, worth it! Their rolls are delicious as is everything I've tried on their menu. I suggest sharing with friends as otherwise you won't be able to experience as much. That said, they have some good tasting plate options for one."}
{"text":"I brought my friend here for celebrating her birthday and it was just perfect! The staffs were very patient to assist me to succeed my plan to surprise my friend by serving her a dessert with the birthday notes (with her name on the plate oh yeah)! I know I was super nervous and confirmed it over and over again because I just wanted to make sure it would success. The food were absolutely amazing! The Miku Chopped Salad was one of the best I'd ever had ( TOP3 I am sure)!!!! The Kaisen Soba was a great mixture of Japanese and Italian. Of course the aburi sushi were something must eat!"}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious lunch. Love the Miku Zen! It features 4 dishes with all different elements."}
{"text":"Miku is a place that really stands out from the crowd. Its more of a modern upscale Japanese restaurant with great food. I came here to celebrate a birthday with the gf and from making a reservation online to arriving at the restaurant everything was grade A all the way. Ill break this review up into two main sections food and service.  Service - its good to know that a place isnt just good for food but the service you are receiving is on par with the food and Miku delivers. From simple things like a confirmation call from the restaurant the day of the reservation to following through on wishing my gf a happy birthday by first name was just amazing. Waiters are very attentive and service is prompt and courteous. 4/5.  Food - if the presentation of the food is not enough to wow you the food itself is even better. The sushi is fresh but I think where they really stand out is the pressed & torched sushi. Definite must try items here include the Miku roll, Salmon & Mackerel Oshi sushi, and make sure you save room for desert, particularly the Green Tea Opera and Chocolate Hazlenut. If you are someone who likes to sample everything I would recommend the Miku Kaiseki course which gives you a sample of everything across the menu. I wouldn't put the sushi as good as places like Zen but comes very close in terms of freshness and variety. Solid 4/5."}
{"text":"I've been wanting a Miku location in Toronto ever since I tried Miku in Vancouver. I have dreams about the Salmon Oshi roll with the jalapeno peppers on top. Mmmm. Miku Toronto does not disappoint. The decor is nice and they kept the prices the same as the Vancouver location (aka it's still expensive but at least not more expensive). I tried the green tea opera as well and it was lovely. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Aburi sushi you can find in Toronto! This is especially impressive considering how hard it is to find fresh fish for sushi in this city. The menu is pricier than the average joint, but the quality of the food more than justifies it.   The salmon and saba oshi sushi are must haves for any visit here! (the ebi oshi is totally skippable). I would also recommend trying the Miku or Red Wave rolls as well. The only disappointment here was the alcohol and wine list, as our drinks were overpriced and unimpressive. Just stick to the food and your taste buds will thank you =)"}
{"text":"The aburi sushi variety is really tasty and melts in your mouth. I'd recommend coming for lunch, ordering the Zen Box. It's a much better value. At dinner, the same things (or similar items) cost much more. If the $$$ turns you off, check out Saku Sushi on Queen for great value torched sushi selections. Not as top quality as Miku, but equally fresh and tastes really good, more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"The sushi is fresh and delicious. Their aburi is legit! The decor is modern and open. The restaurant is pretty big so can accommodate a lot of people. They have a cute little private room (fits around 14 comfortably) that is off of the main dining room - it's more secluded but still feels like you're part of the action. They're kid friendly and have high chairs/kid menu (aka soba noodles). Minus 0.5 star because it's $$$. Definitely will return though!"}
{"text":"The aburi sushi is likely the only plate really worth getting which is their speciality. They really do a good job with it however we tried the squid appetizer and a few other plates and were fairly disappointed. We felt it was a bit overpriced for what we got."}
{"text":"Food ***** Service **** Ambiance ****1/2 (Out of 5)  Great sushi.  Just an incredible experience having some delightful seafood.   The sashimi lunch was to die for... And made me very happy!  Service was attentive for the most part.  At one point I couldn't find my waiter, however I think this is because of the layout.     I'd happily return and also recommend to sushi lovers!!!"}
