{"text":"Great family style diner with excellent wait staff. Large breakfast menu and great place for brunch on weekends or lunch on weekdays. 

Tried the California eggs benedict, and this is great with the avocado. Highly recommend the burgers as well as the patties are \"home made\" and tastes quite good.

Rate as four stars only because of the inconsistent quality of food at dinner service. 

But all things considered, a go to place for a great meal."}
{"text":"If you never had good breakfast, you will like this diner.... cheap cheap cold coffee, flavourless potatoes, cheap stinky sausage, orders were taken wrong and the bills came in wrong..overall I must say that this dinner is feeding you cheap ingredients at a cora price point."}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST IN AURORA!! Portions are giant and they have better options than other breakfast places.

Even if you know a place that has comparable food you wont find a place with nicer or friendlier staff. 

Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and nice atmosphere! Lots to choose from on a big menu, from all day breakfast to nice size diner foods! Prices are ok and our food came fast, 2 breakfasts and a fish and chips"}
{"text":"Love this place! We go at least once a week, whether it's for their all day breakfast or even a quick after work bite! Servers are super friendly and food comes out fast. Great little diner with the classic \"back-in-the-day\" decor. I send everyone here when they suggest Coras or some other sub-par chain!"}
{"text":"Fabulous decor from the 50's and an equally great food menu. The milk shakes are real ice cream and are thick and delicious. 
Friendly, quick service with free coffee refills. 
Still the best all day breakfast to be found!"}
{"text":"I had high expectation for this place. Nice decor and friendly staff. I order my breakfast and watched it sit under the light on the counter while the staff chatted in the back. What really put me off was the fact that some cops came in and ordered take out paid for it and left with it before my extremely cold breakfast arrived. I will not return to this place again."}
{"text":"If you are really into breakfast you will like this place. They have an extensive breakfast menu as well as a lunch items. I got the hearty Canadian breakfast that comes with peameal bacon, 3 eggs, hash browns and toast. Everything was cooked really well. The only gripe I have with the place is that service can be a bit slow especially when they are busy. They were fast taking our orders and getting our food to us but any refills on drinks were non-existent. We asked several times and finally just gave up. Overall not bad but  I wouldn't make a special trip just to eat here."}
{"text":"3.5- I liked the staff very friendly very sweet. The meal was overall good. The sausages was so over cooked it looked like it was out in the sun for 9 hours lol. Only 3/5were. The meal was good it was salty so if you have high cholesterol I wouldn't recommend. The bathrooms were very clean they have a lot of food options. It wasn't the cheapest but it wasn't the expensist... I got s filling meal , plus coffee and tip it was almost $15 so you can take it the way u feel. I would probably go back. Nothing beats 3 coins tho price wise"}
{"text":"This is a super cozy diner! I came here for breakfast a few rimes. The servers are always super sweet. I normally get the hungry woman and it's so yummy! Great little spot! :)"}
{"text":"Cute breakfast place at an old school diner theme restaurant.

They have retro decor and shiny booths. Service is moderate but friendly. 

There's Lots of good options on the menu. Definitely recommend this place over any franchise breakfast place. 

Got the hungry woman and egg Benny. 
The portion was good, filling and no left over. Waffles were soft and fluffy. I like how they used grated chocolates instead of chocolate syrup so it wasn't too sweet. I would prefer if it came with toast to eat with the eggs and bacon. 

The egg Benny sauce was bland and it should always come with protein.  One thing I didn't like was that 3 poached eggs were served on 2 English muffins. The home fries were good tho and they had good portions of avocado."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday and loved it! Great burger and MILKSHAKES!! This place has everything that a diner should. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Food is very low quality. The bacon is like rubber and hard to chew, the eggs are flavourless, and the toast is always burnt. Service is the main issue....it's busy there because nobody can leave! It takes forever to get menus, take an order or receive an order. SOme staff there are amazing and it isn't their fault but the overalll experience is not good. Quality is not good and service is way below average."}
{"text":"I get what the place is trying to do. I love old school diners and the decor definitely aims to make it just that.
Unfortunately, we were very disappointed with it as a restaurant. Both times we were there, the table, sugar dispenser and menus were just filthy. Sticky, filmy and smelled bad. 
The portion sizes were large but the breakfast was bad. The potatoes tasted like they were cooked at day or two in advance and then re-cooked to order. The eggs were very oily. 
The service was attentive but unfriendly.  
Given the number of breakfast options in the area we won't be back."}
{"text":"We went there on Saturday for brunch because we read some good review about it. 
They are located very close to the Aurora GO Train station and it is easy to locate. 
This is an old-style busy d√Æner. Once we got inside,  we were greeted by a young boy who politely seated us. 
Our server was a very nice old lady who promptly took our order and the food came out quickly. 
I ordered the Mercury Egg Benedict and it was amazing! The egg was poached in perfection and the peameal was not salty. 
My husband ordered the Hungry woman's breakfast and the waffles we're delicious. Even his sunny side up eggs we're so fresh and fluffy. 
The root beer float was in a generous portion: 3 balls of ice cream and some extra root beer on the side, if kids see this,  they will definitely be super happy. It even worked on my husband! 
The atmosphere was relaxing. 
There are some old-fashioned tv at some tables,  but either they we're shut off or just black and white flurries we're showing,  which was little weird. It will be nice of it is shown with some old classics. 
We did not see a working jukebox there,  zoo bad,  because it will be nice to put some coin in to play some old-time favorites at the background and enjoy our satisfying brunch.
We really had nice experience there and will come back, recommend!"}
{"text":"Great little \"retro\" diner close to the go station. Service is good and so is the food. Better than some \"retro\" diners I've been too. Prices are average(comparable) to most diners in the area."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and it's a great place for a casual brunch. Some of our favorites include the Mercury Eggs Benedict and their waffles are great! 

Coffee is surprisingly good for a diner!

Generous portions and fair prices. Service is good for the price."}
{"text":"Cute retro diner! Came here for breakfast one morning and anywhere I go, I always order the eggs Benedict and French toast. Anyhow, there was nothing spectacular about the eggs Benedict. The French toast was too dry and had no flavour. Food overall was ok and service was good. This wouldn't be my first choice for getting breakfast but it isn't so bad either."}
{"text":"Consistently great food and great service and a traditional 50's diner atmosphere. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Was here for lunch and loved the massive chicken burger and the pasta that was served. The chicken burger particularly was juicy and well worth the money spent. The interiors are filled with Broadway images and the servers were friendly."}
{"text":"My huband and I went Sunday afternoon at 2:00 for a late lunch not realizing they were closing at 3:00.

We were promptly seated and ordered our food within 5 minutes.  

I had a greek salad, with a hamburger patty on.  The patty was home made and flavourful.  The salad was fresh and not overly done in dressing with the right amount of feta cheese.

My husband also had a burger with fries and enjoyed his meal.

We would define go back, if we are looking for something basic and tasty."}
{"text":"First breakfast in Toronto. I ordered egg Florentine. It takes quite some time to come, as my husband and his friend's meal comes first. But it worth the wait, and first time had egg and spinach with bread like this, but it taste so good.. I should have taken a picture of that.. beautiful."}
{"text":"The quality of food is really hit or miss.  Sometimes the food is good, other times it is absolute garbage.  Considering the relatively high prices, it simply isn't worth the risk.  After my third time getting inedible food and the management telling me there was nothing wrong with it (half my lasagna was burned so badly even the noodles were black, the half that was edible tasted like vinegar) I gave up on them."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a diner setting then this is the place but good and service is a little below average. It has the classic diner look which makes this unique. The service was a little lacking which you can see during the busy hour where tables weren't getting cleared in a timely manner. The worst part was when the server brought something that we didn't order which had to go back, then the server brought me a coffee which I also didn't order. 

In terms of the food, I ordered their florentine which looked ok visually. The hollandaise sauced looked a little on the light side and that could have been caused by the cheese flakes (which made it way too salty). I ordered the poach egg to be medium rare so it will be runny when you break it but instead I got one that was well done. Overall was kind of disappointed because of the well done poach egg, the salty hollandaise sauce, and the lacking in service."}
{"text":"Overall impression: Super cute retro themed diner with incredibly friendly staff and affordable food with big portions

I've been here numerous times and always had a pleasant meal. The d√©cor is full of 50's theme tin signs and retro TV's in every booth, the servers are always lovely and friendly. There are lots of options for food and famous for their all day breakfast. I highly recommend getting any of their eggs Benedict or breakfast combos! Also, their home fries come out perfectly done as you get the option of picking how crispy or soft you like them! The food quality otherwise is decent but not amazing, considering the pricing and it's atmosphere it's definitely not a bad spot to catch some classic diner food. 

You also want to come here hungry because they don't skimp out on their portion sizes!"}
