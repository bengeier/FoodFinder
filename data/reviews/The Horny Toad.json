{"text":"Best fried chicken EVER!  Love the old west ambiance.  The service is very friendly and dinner won't break the bank at this Cave Creek, AZ institution."}
{"text":"Low key - food is ok.  The fried chicken is the thing to get.  Lots of stuff to look at inside and out.  Good for the kids"}
{"text":"I am from Kentucky and a lifelong lover of fried chicken. So for me to say that their fried chicken might well be the best I've ever had is a powerful statement. The fried chicken is delicious. The barbecue sauce is delicious. The ribs are moist and perfect. Will be back!"}
{"text":"A work team went here for lunch after horse back riding. 
I guess it would be a good hang out place after that or biking, boating, etc. 

The appetizers weren't anything to get excited over - typical fried bar food.

The fired chicken only comes as a whole chicken. I didn't try it but it got an \"ok\" rating. I got the tijuana torpedo burger - that's right...2/3 pound of burger, with cheese and green chilies shoved inside and cooked. It was sight to behold sitting there on the plate but my mouth was not so impressed. It was decent.

We got the apple and strawberry shortcake deserts. Both were the highlight of lunch I thought. I loved the apples with the cinnamon and sugar topping."}
{"text":"Went to Horny Toad for lunch with my wife one more time (no more)! We have ALWAYS had poor to deplorable service at this restaurant.  I think we walk in here with a sign on our foreheads saying \"don't wait on these people\". I had the (all you can eat?) fish fry and my wife had the tacos.  The breading on the fish was hard and difficult to eat and the fish was tough.  The fries had a strange taste.  My wife's tacos were dripping in grease - actually dripped grease on the table. This place is way overpriced but if you want to experience because of its reputation of the past be my guest.  If you want a good fish fry Heart & Soul still has the best one!  Being from the Midwest I guess I consider myself a bit of an \"officianado\"!"}
{"text":"sat at bar great bartender very friendly very long dark hair.. the fajitas were great, the strawberry short cake was something you all must try fabulous delicious. ."}
{"text":"I went on 4th of July,2016. After reading about their Fried Chicken...I want to try it.  It was a thin layer of breading, soaked in GREASE! Only crispy part was the burnt wing. You get a 1/2 of a Chicken(4pc's) w Cole Slaw, that was really poor in taste! I've had better(pre packaged) from a Grocery Isle! Then a SMALL, order of fries comes with it. No Biscuit or even a Roll,or piece of Bread of any sorts??? No soup or salad either. for $11.95 The Drink for the night was a Prickly Pear Margarita-$6.95. A 8oz glass filled to the brim w/ice! Approx 4oz of drink in it. I only drink on Holidays.  I came w/an empty stomach, ate nothing the entire day. I drank the drink while waitin for my meal. It had no effect of any alcohol being in the drink?  I should've had a slight warm buzz happening right? NOTHING! As if they made 1 drink &split amongst 3 glasses of ice, to make- 3 drinks out of it instead! Literally! I no longer buy Deli fried chicken from local grocery stores. Too often not cooked, very small pieces.It would have been better than theirs! I should have just went to KFC, then I could 've watched the Fireworks from my own vehicle.  Not waited almost 40 mins for a seat for 1. This was my first dinner alone,since my 32yr marriage fell apart. I left him. I'm a TRUTH SEEKER! In my marriage & my review.  I paid $24.00 for greasy,tasteless chicken& a FAUX Maragarita! Including the tip. I could've gotten a 3pc, w 2 sides& a Biscuit for $5.
My Waitress was prompt and,attentive tho. I tipped her accordingly. I know she didn't cook that nasty chicken. It's a great way to relieve constipation but, too expensive of an remedy."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken I've ever had! Husband had country fried steak which was also amazing!!! He are from both plates!!! 
Can't wait to come back for a burger!!!"}
{"text":"First time for dinner here, great as usual. The wife and I come for lunch regularly and always good service as well as tasty food. Atmosphere is fitting for Cave Creek. Outside and inside seating are equally great and the service does not change if you are outside like some places do. Recommend stopping in anytime in Cave Creek. Alcoholic drinks are a pleasurable mix too!"}
{"text":"Food was very good but \"the Perfect Matgarita\" which was recommended by our waitress was the smallest, weakest and the most ice filled Margarita that i have EVER had and they charged $8.50.  Next time i will drink a beer."}
{"text":"Long time visitors to the area and first time at the Horny Toad.

Read all the reviews before going..but sometimes you just need to see experience for ones self.
Overall probably  a 3 1/2

The 1/2 chicken was fresh, the coating and fry were top notch. Nothing fancy..just well executed and enough for 2 or the next day.

The deep fried cod was in a good batter. Could of been a tad flakier..but this was better than most you might get  outside of the coasts.

The boneless pork with carrots and mash were all very good. Perfect cook on the pork
 Carrotts tasted fresh  and mash was ok

Slaw was very good but fries were disappointing and the weak link
But hey..the entrees were all above average to good



Coleslaw was very good .Fries were the weak part of the meals across the board."}
{"text":"We've only had the whole fried chicken and strawberry shortcake and these two items were perfectly made. Prices a little high but its a tourist spot. All in all a good experience and will be returning soon. For we locals, its best to go in the off hours and on a weekday as it gets very busy at certain times."}
{"text":"I had a half a rack of baby back ribs and they were pretty good. Mango margarita was good. The side salad was good. Cole slaw was run-of-the-mill."}
{"text":"Service was poor. I ordered the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes. It was a frozen Swanson dinner chicken fried steak. Mashed potatoes were instant mashed potatoes from a box. Famous fried chicken....they are a legend in their own mind!!!  NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Beef Ribs are off the menu the say the will brink them back once and a while , I'm sad about it but we just tried something else . 
It was a long trip and a sad one 
Well Happy New Year !!!"}
{"text":"This place has a fun and relaxed design with a western style that mixes well with the location. Just the name itself makes it a rather memorable place to take out-of-town guests. Overall, the food was good and had pretty large portions (the Tijuana burger was pretty huge to me) Apparently their fried chicken is popular, but I didn't realize that before I ordered. I really would've loved to see how it compared to other restaurants that are known for their fried chicken!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I drove up to Cave Creek, anxious to do something different than your typical weekend night.  

He got the ribs and I got the friend chicken.  I really loved his ribs - the barbecue sauce was perfect.  And they even bring you a bottle of it, knowing you'll want more than what it comes with.  The fried chicken was good too - but is way too much to eat in one serving. Both were quite good.  

We also ordered their 'famous' strawberry shortcake.  I was a little disappointed in this after reading about how great it was.  I wouldn't order it again.

All in all, I loved the cowboy vibe and it made for a fun winter evening!"}
{"text":"I might have set myself up for failure. I got the half chicken fried. Idk the last time I got fried chicken but it was alright. I don't think I'm a big fried chicken guy I guess. The mash potatoes were good. My gf got the ground beef taco salad. The issue was the moisture and oil pooled at the bottom. It was like a soup down there. I had one bite and didn't really like it"}
{"text":"Everything was very great. Had the fried chicken and the chicken fried steak, both really good. Every thing was very hot as well when it hit the table. Server could be a little more attentive only complaint, but in her defense she did seem to be doing multiply jobs."}
{"text":"Date night with my wife. Decided to try this restaurant as I have never bee there. Wait time was not bad (15 minutes), and waitress took our drink and food order. While eating, a group of people sat behind us. Very loud and obnoxious to say the least! They were discussing very offensive things, dropping F bombs, and very crude. Tried to tolerate it, but was really getting bad and louder! Complained to the manager, and he offered to relocate us to another table, but by that time, we were ready to leave. Offered boxes for our food to take home, came back with the check, and apologized for the rudeness, while not offering to comp a meal, or anything of the sort. He stated that this was a family establishment. If I had brought my family here, I would have been truly embarrassed to bring them there to listen to a bunch of foul mouths like we had to put up with. Again, the food was great, but this place left a bad taste in my mouth, and will never spend my hard earned money where a manager does not take care of its customers!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Arizona, this is one of our go to restaurants. It is a cute southwestern bar that fits in with the Cave Creek setting. Their fried chicken is great, especially to split with another person! The service is not always great, but I still always enjoy visiting the Horny Toad. Sit outside on the patio and watch the sunset over the mountains."}
{"text":"Walked in with a massive hangover, shot of Jameson, a beer, and a patty melt....walked out feeling like a million bucks.....THANKS"}
{"text":"I have been here before but not in many years. It was an absolutely beautiful day to be in cave creek and many people were there. 

We stopped at the toad for lunch and we were seated on the covered patio. We were surprised with an added bonus of live music while we dined. It was fantastic. Country western favorites paired perfectly with the ambiance and the surrounding mountains and desert. 

The food was adequate but not amazing. I got a salad and it was fine. No real complaint at this time. I will admit if not for the atmosphere and perfect weather I would give this a 3. 

If I could recreate the day every weekend I would go to the toad for everyone. Sunday love music!!!!"}
{"text":"I had an awful experience here on Sunday. Service was bad. Our waitress walked right past us without an acknowledgement at all. When she did come over she said oh I thought you were the last people sitting here. I guess all customers look the same? I wonder how do u ruin Taco Salad and Chili? The Horny Toad sure can!!!"}
{"text":"I can't speak for anything other than their fried chicken. Amaaazing! I don't even like fried chicken but friends told us we had to get it it was that good. They were right. Perfectly crispy with the right amount of seasoning while the chicken was plump and moist. 1 chicken fed 4 of us. The prickly pear Margarita was pretty tasty too. Fun casual atmosphere in a cute little old western town."}
{"text":"Yea no... not doing that again.... cheese crisps are on corn torts.... so they are yey big.... Salmon ceasar salad.... not impressed."}
{"text":"Excellent comfort food. Best fried chicken crisp golden brown and juicy. Prime rib, steaks, BBQ, fish and burger great too. Cool rustic place in Wild West town"}
{"text":"Some people think the name is R-rated but it actually stands for a toad with horns. 

The Fried Chicken alone is worth the treck -- freshly plucked, never frozen and you can taste the difference. You can order a half chicken but for only a few dollars more you can get a whole chicken for about $18 which can feed 3 people. The hamburger was just OK but the Grilled Chicken Salad was huge -- it can easily feed 2-3 people. On a nice day, sit out on the patio and imbibe the Cave Creek ambiance. We've always had good service here and my tourist friends always enjoy this place."}
{"text":"The Horny Toad was better than I expected. Their were four in our party for a Sunday lunch. We all had different sandwiches/burgers and all were quite good. The only thing that didnt impress was the strawberry shortcake, because they used frozen strawberries. The service was friendly and the prices were about what you'd expect at a local tourist watering hole. The weather was beautiful, so we sat outside, which was very pleasant and scenic. The inside also looked nice with Old West touches. 

I'll definitely go back to the Horny Toad the next time I'm in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Upon first arriving in Arizona, my boss's relatives were insistent upon visiting a BBQ place about 20 minutes from our hotel. I wasn't feeling picky and everyone seemed game after a few hotel lobby drinks, so a huge group of us drove out to check this place out.

The Horny Toad has plenty of kitsch value upon arrival, and that aspect is played up heavily. There are wacky signs, funny T-shirts, and gift shops filled with an odd assortment of local art and weird novelty items. The wait was almost 2 hours, so that left us lots of time to look around, but they did have a large side bar where we hung out and listened to some passable country covers from a local band.

Once we ate, it lost a bit of its luster. From most of the people sitting around me, word has it that the ribs were stringy and not very good, and disappointment hit a lot of my co-workers. I, however, lucked out, because I was struck by the menu's insistence on the fried chicken. The chicken was outstanding, the breading was top notch and the meat was tender and delicious. The actual barbecue sauce was excellent, and I poured that on my fried chicken (I highly recommend this if you come here!)

In the end, I didn't think the wait and the hype were nearly worth it, but I had a very yummy meal at the end of it all and I might have been the only one at our table who enjoyed our late night dinner. It's a big, weird tourist trap, but if you're coming here, take my advice and get the fried chicken."}
{"text":"BEST FRIED CHICKEN - OMG!! GET IT! Love the atmosphere! The waitress could have been a little friendlier but I was so into my damn fried chicken that I could have cared less at that point!"}
{"text":"Came here last Saturday afternoon for a late lunch.  We ate here last fall and loved the place but this time it fell flat.  The service was painfully slow and the food was not nearly as good.  We'll be back to give it another shot but this time it just was not good."}
{"text":"If it weren't for overdone fried chicken I'd give it 5 stars. Went especially for the chicken and anything over cooked just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Been there 3 x though so I have to admit it must have been an off night. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"We Made reservations for a birthday party of 15 a week in advance. Service- We only had one server,  who appeared irritated by our presence. Short answers and Negative body language. Waited an hour for our food. The Food- vegetables, undercooked, another persons chicken was supposed to have BBQ sauce on the side as suggested by the server, it didn't . A medium steak arrived rare and a side of sweet potatoes was over cooked. Bad service and the food failures made for a poor overall experience."}
{"text":"Wish I could leave 0 stars. 

We came here two years ago. Dinner was OK. Cute place. 

Decided to stop for dinner. VERY few people there (not a good sign).  Again, not busy. Waited 10 mins. Waitress came near us 3 times. Never greeted us. Never welcomed us. 10 minutes. Again not busy.  

We got up and left. Service is terrible. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Very DISAPPOINTING.  When we arrived, no one was there to greet us at the front door for at least 5 minutes.  When we finally got seated, no one came to the table to take our order for an inordinate time.  We ordered 2 Cadillac Margaritas, and the waitress had no idea what that was. Then, even though they weren't that busy like a Friday night, it took a long time to deliver the drinks.  Ordered the BBQ chicken and it was very dry, not the usual moist chicken I've had there before, and expected.  It seemed that they may have been understaffed tonight,"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place has only 3 stars. 
Yes it's not 5 stars place, but it's very southwestern restaurant in old Cave Creek, with appropriate  menu.
We tasted multiply items and yes I will not comeback there for BBQ, but like chicken fried steak and even liver and onions, 
But fried chicken it's die for , I can't imagine it's can be done more moist, and that alone make this place 5 stars for me"}
{"text":"Compared to real Southern Fried Chicken, this fried chicken is a total farce.  It is unbelievable they
can remain in business, serving imitation fried chicken, what a total joke!"}
{"text":"Took my brother there for his birthday at the recommendation of someone. We arrived at 6pm on a Saturday and the restaurant was empty and we quickly found out why. Prices are maybe average but the food is below average. Beer selection is poor so I ended up with a Fat Tire that only came in a 12oz pour. The beer tasted like cardboard which means it is either really old or they don't actually clean the beer lines (or both). When I couldn't choke the beer down I took the glass that was mostly left to the bar to let the staff know. Apparently this was unacceptable to do because the bartender had a real attitude about it (you would have thought I was the one charging money for a bad product) We waited quite a while for our dinner, especially considering there was no one in the restaurant. Food was bland. I got the fried chicken and regretted it. I should have ordered a burger to save money. Dessert wasn't that great either.  The worst part about this whole experience was we drove almost 30 miles to get there. I won't be going back, especially since you can find better food and beer on every corner in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Every time my wife and I come to AZ we just have to stop at The Horny Toad in Cave Creek for the chicken and the ribs.  The place is real country, the staff is friendly and efficient, and we always have a great time.  We didn't try their famous strawberry shortcake because we were always stuffed, but I'm positive we'll be back to try that option in the future."}
{"text":"Went to The Horny Toad when on a friend's suggestion, chicken was good but service wasn't great.  Also, we tried the Key Lime Pie and it was a disappointment,  tasted like it was from a box and/or defrosted."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been there since the new owners took over. I was pleasantly surprised that things only got better. Food was great and promptly served. Wait staff fantastic. My kids...pickiest kids ever enjoyed every bit of their grilled cheese, Mac and cheese and crispy fries, I even had some. Yum!"}
{"text":"We always go to this watering hole when in Cave Creek. There is nothing not to like. The bartender is sweet & competent. Always willing to chat. I haven't had the fried chicken since I was a kiddo so I'm going to have to try it again soon based on the reviews. So stay tuned for that."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Since the new owners took over, this place has gone straight downhill faster than a skier on a double diamond slope. Service is non-existent, food is bland, over-cooked, greasy and does not even look appetizing. All this for a half hour to hour wait for a table. Don't be fooled by the empty tables on the patio or restaurant. The frowning woman who seats customers doesn't want the wait staff to feel rushed or stressed out so she leaves most of the tables empty. God forbid they experience an honest day's work for the higher prices they now charge."}
{"text":"Went to Cave Creek and decided to try The Horny Toad!  Was fun looking at the gift shop and the restaurant was tasty.  Enjoyed chatting with other customers that were in the outdoor section, We all seemed to enjoy the place! Service was excellent ! Seems to me the prices were high for what they were! Overall I did enjoy it and had to buy the HORNY TOAD TEE SHIRTS."}
{"text":"Ate here recently. Had their burgers which were large and came out cooked exactly as ordered. Onion rings were very good. Found the restaurant to be very dimly lite. The staff was very attentive and our server was great. We went on the weekend and while the parking lot was full, we did not have a long wait to be seated and were never rushed."}
{"text":"Love the fried chicken it is the best, fresh made, classic and simple. If you are looking for newer styles with twists it is not for you. Also I fing the other stuff a only ok, but we always just order chicken and the kids dig in! Noisy atmosphere makes good places to take young kids too, friendly staff."}
{"text":"I'm hooked on the fried chicken at this restaurant!  I have it every time I go and, looking at my friend's choices, I'm glad I stick to the same thing.  

My friend ordered the beef ribs and they were not appealing whatsoever and had a gray tinge to them.  He said they were alright and I was surprised they were even \"alright\".  

Back to the chicken.  So good and juicy.  They really have got that mastered, in my opinion, and I'll continue to head there when I have a fried chicken craving.  The portion is big enough that I usually have enough left over to take home, except this past visit.  I had a drumstick, wing, breast and back and the back didn't really have any meat on it at all and the wing was minuscule so I pretty much had to rely on the breast and drumstick to feel full and, really, the drum didn't have a lot to it either.  I have to say that in the past, the chicken is usually much meatier and I usually bring one or two pieces home.  My biggest problem with the dish is that they serve these horrible soggy french fries that must be cooked from the frozen state because they certainly weren't cut fresh and were flavorless.  They really were terrible.  I would love mashed potatoes with fried chicken but they don't serve those until after 4 p.m.  Kind of a bummer but I'm there for the chicken anyways."}
{"text":"Excellent food, thank goodness, But the service was the worst!!! Arrived around 130pm Lunch time and the host didnt even smile. It was as if he didnt want to be there at all. So it always starts with the greeting, the server never offered water my coffee up was empty the whole time and she should be happy with a $2 tip because 2 people and a $40 lunch I would of wished that it was more enjoyable. Again the food is great but the greeter and the servers all look like they dont want to be there at work. There are lots of people that would love a job and enjoys people. Management should really work on the staff. Thanks"}
{"text":"Get your best cowboy and cowgirl boots on and head on out to Horny Toad one of the best burger & BBQ place in Cave Creek ! Prices, atmosphere, service and food all fantastic."}
{"text":"Decided to take a drive up to carefree.Looked up a restaurant on yelp we saw The Horny Toad food looked delish.They were famous for there fried chicken Omgoodness it was yummo.A must try if you like fry chicken and also good portions.My boyfriend tried the meatloaf he was in love really good nice old fashion dish.Also gotta try there award winning chili.Was I right a gem in carefree Az...."}
{"text":"Been coming here for awhile but last couple of times have not been great. My fries were fried in rancid oil. They smelled horrible. The food was not great. There were 4 at the table and we all agreed that something was off. Maybe just a couple of bad nights. Unfortunately, with so many other eateries we won't be coming back. Sad"}
{"text":"The fried chicken is the BOMB!!!  That's it.  Enough said.  Oh, and the atmosphere is fun, the décor is fun, and the wait staff is fun.  One of my go-to faves :)"}
{"text":"Love southern fried chicken so had to give the Horny Toad a shot.  Serivce was a bit slow but friendly.  Chicken was deep fried and not pan fried the way i love it but was good for what it was.  It didn't taste too greasy and the meat was moist but the bottom of the plate had grease pooled on it when the chicken was gone.  There were 5 of us eating.  The cobb salad 1 star, the taco salad 2 stars, the fish sandwich 1 star, so I'd have to say the chicken was the best of what we had.  Will I bookmark this for a return visit?  Probably not."}
{"text":"A group of us in the Cave Creek area for the National Concierge Association 2013 conference enjoyed a tasty lunch at the Horny Toad.

The portions are huge, especially the desserts, the service was exceptional and you can even purchase a shirt to remind you of your experience at the Horny Toad.

Horny Toad addressed some of our dietary restrictions without any hassles, which was very appreciative.  

I recommend the Horny Toad for a casual outing if your in the area."}
{"text":"My family and I had such a great time at The Horny Toad. Their food was great and the staff was very friendly. Jim the manager came up to our table to make sure everything was good, and he made us feel very welcome. We will definitely go back the next time we are in Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"Had the ribs and they were very good. Service was attentive, hubby liked his steak. The apple pie with cinnamon vanilla ice cream-yummy."}
{"text":"I should have had the half fried chicken and Ron special on Sunday when ventured in to eat a late lunch.  The decor will remind you of your grandmother's rec room back in the seventies.  Dark, high beams with tri colored window pained glass.  I love it already.  Plus, light fixtures that are old steel pipes.  

Back to the food.  I ordered the French dip.  I beg you, TAKE THIS ITEM OFF THE MENU IF YOU CANNOT DELIVER!  Please!  

A French Dip should be shaved thin and served at medium temperature.  On bread that is fresh.  I can tell this establishment used the French rolls from Thursday on a Sunday.  I'm a blue cheese fan.  But the early onset taste of mold in contrast with the welldone thickly sliced roast beef was comical at best.  Offensive at the least.  I felt let down.  Especially with the menu description.  \"French Dip.  Need we say more!\"  Um, yes!  Tell me I shouldn't have ordered it!"}
{"text":"Western/Biker themed place. Three stars overall, but \"absoposilutey\" 6 stars for the fried chicken. 
Soooooo good!"}
{"text":"OK... I'm not some elitist snob that only dines out in 5 star establishments and though I do have an educated palate, I'm also a realist when it comes to the type of place where I'm dining. 

That said... I accept that I'm now going to be known as the \"Official Curmudgeon\" of yelp... but I can't help but believe in the concept of service and quality in exchange for fair compensation. 

Unfortunately, it's a totally unknown (or ignored) concept here. 

Come on! Really? FIVE BUCKS for a Corona?? This is AZ people, not NYC! 

Combined with the \"famous\" ribs that seriously would NOT place in my top FIFTY and a sour faced waitress that clearly didn't give a s*#& if we were happy, this has to top our list of dining ripoffs. You could offer me 500 bucks to eat here and I'd pick the cafeteria at my old high school instead! 

If this place were anywhere but Cave Creek where people obviously have money to piss away, they wouldn't survive. 

Wish I could rate 0 stars."}
{"text":"Im telling you now!!!! They have the best fried chicken and the service is excellent. I recommend this to everyone could take your family your friends everyone you know to the horny toad"}
{"text":"When I first moved to the Phoenix area I drove past this place a number of times thinking, \"tourist trap where people from the Midwest pretend they're cowboys\".  I suppose that's partially true - hint to the guy from Chicago, black shoes, black over the calf socks, tan shorts, cowboy hat and creamy white legs isn't a good look on you or anyone else. I don't care how horny the toad is.

The first time I came here I had the pulled pork sandwich. It was OK but it wasn't great. It was a bit overcooked making it dry and the BBQ sauce tasted store bought. For my most recent visit I went for the BBQ chicken. Ah yes! this is the meal to order.  It was very good. Tasty, moist, good flavor.  Nice job!

The service is odd.  It was busy and the wait staff were running around like crazy people. A positive is we were spared the \"hi, my name is Suzy and I'll be your server\" bit.  What you get instead is - \"OK, whatcha havin?\" I'm OK with that in a place like this.

Not the best restaurant in the area, but a nice stop for a good meal and you've got to love the name (they sell tshirts)."}
{"text":"Went last weekend. Asked the waitress what she recommend and what was good. She said everything, but that the fried chicken was popular. I ordered the fried chicken didn't think I'd eat it all but it was so good I cleaned my plate. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Very good service and the half fried chicken is the go to dish! Plan on waiting it takes about 20 min to cook! The strawberry shortcake is the local secret, so be sure and box up some chicken for later and have dessert! A must have!!"}
{"text":"Came up here for the 40th anniversary special where there prices were lower.  Was told that we have an hour wait and since it would take over the hour the specials would be invalid.  The fact there is a deadline is one thing but the manager/owner didn't have to have such an attitude about it.  Must be so hard being nice to people when you have a lot of business.  Probably a good place but if you don't want to deal with jerks, skip it.   Just my opinion."}
{"text":"Came here with 3 other people, we ordered the chicken and rib special, if you want to get more bang for your buck, order the white meat. The ribs were fairly good, and so was the chicken , BBQ sauce was good, but over all I have had better, and you are paying for the atmosphere, which is interesting, old west style. The waitress was attentive. I would come back, if some one else is paying. I live here so tourist area theme places don't excite me all that much."}
{"text":"No idea why they call this a steakhouse because everyone knows you come here for FRIED CHICKEN.  I can't speak for anything else on the menu but the fried chicken is great and inexpensive (less than $15).  They don't get rid of the excess fat (dieters beware) on the chicken which may be why some didn't like it, but most people will like it and most women will get a 2nd meal out of it.  And yes Cave Creek is a total tourist trap... but the eats are good and most restaurants are casual so you can be in your sneakers and not feel grungy!"}
{"text":"We stop here every time we're in the area... the fried chicken is absolutely, hands down, the BEST I have ever had. We never have a problem with service, always friendly & fast."}
{"text":"Starting to make my way through the Cave Creek food world. Most of these restaurants seemed aimed at tourists (pomp and circumstance), although people from Cave Creek and Carefree likely frequent some of these joints. The Toad has been around for years, but this was my first visit. Two people had fairly normal bacon Cheeseburgers with some beer battered fries. Not the worst burger, but just average. Chicken strips were better than normal, but personally I had the chicken salad at $12.95. This was the most unusual salad ever teeming with both fresh fruit and veggies. There were corn cobs, cantalope, celery stalks, huge slices of white chicken on a bed of iceberg lettuce. The homemade blue cheese dressing was another highlight - loaded with blue cheese chunks.
    Of course, had to try to famous Strawberry Shortcake and it delivered. Lots of soaked strawberries and soaked cake made this a good bargain (small was $5.95, feeds 3)."}
{"text":"Horny Toad's Known for their fried chicken and strawberry shortcake.
So of course we had to stop in! The interior was a little too dark for our eyes so we sat outside under the Terrance and vines on high end picnic benches.
The five of us ordered all different types of entrées including: fried chicken sandwich, Rueben sandwich, bbq beef, fried chicken and mash potatoes and the taco salad.
WOW! Every single one of us loved our food!
We recommend the BBQ beef sandwich and save room for a dessert!"}
{"text":"So unfortunately I came here after not being here since I was a child and even though I have a good childhood memories the food quality has just changed because food has become so much better over the course of the years I had the country fried steak and unfortunately the potatoes were cold but the waitress brought me new ones that were semi-warm!"}
{"text":"This place is not ready for prime time. If I thought a 30-35 min wait when they had tables avail meant 2 hours to get food I would have said see ya later. I only write this a now because this is not the he first time. Good luck!  Been here before and will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there for dinner last night. He had the BBQ chicken and I had the steak.  Mt boyfriend has been sick since about an hour when we left the restaurant. Unable to leave the bathroom and it's 3 pm the next day.  I had a bite of his and don't feel horrible but my stomach is upset.  I called to ask the restaurant IF anyone else was sick and Samantha answered the phone.  She basically blew me off and said it much have been something maybe we ate for breakfast. She didn't even say I'm sorry we felt that way- nothing.  Horrible customer service.  Would never go back. I hope Samantha gets some further training on how to treat customers."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is amazing, the mashed potatoes, not so much. The atmosphere is wonderful. Nice and friendly staff."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped here for lunch during our day exploring the touristy towns of Cave Creek and Carefree. It was a nice warm day and we chose to be seated outside. We were surrounded by southwestern kitsch - actually kinda fun and fitting for a day spent going around shops which sell lots of southwestern kitsch. The servers were friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was lively (lots of happy retired people and their hyper grandkids). We ordered fried chicken, and fish 'n chips. We all enjoyed our meals, but also ended up taking quite a bit of food home because the portions were quite generous. The fish and the chicken were nice and crunchy outside, moist and tender within; the fries and slaw were OK, not great. And the prices were good, considering the quality and quantity of the portions we got."}
{"text":"I'm confused by the reviews that the \"famous\" fried chicken was bland and forgettable.  We stopped in today because like many Horny has garnered a reputation for having some of the best fried chicken in the state.  Coming from a man that went to school in the Carolinas and has spent my fair share of time in chicken joints in the south, HT was noteworthy! 

We only got the chicken but it had a great color, texture, and flavor. The batter was unique in a good way and each piece was moist including the breast. Maybe HT had some bad days in the past but they were on their A game today. Will go back to Horny's before Mrs. White's or Lolos any day of the week."}
{"text":"This is a good place to stop for some quick uninspiring grub with your family.

We have some typical diner type food here. Burgers, fries, sandwiches. Everyone was satisfied, and the price was pretty good.

Plenty of parking, great place to bring the kids."}
{"text":"Came to this place because 1). It was recommended by a local merchant owner 2). Looked colorful and fun.

Food: Half Fried Chicken meal-juicy, tasty, not too much batter, filling and good.
          Porter House \"Special\" meal for $22!!! and got a bunk fat marbled steak that was inconsistently cooked. I was so disappointed with this. What a waste of money.

Service: Disappointing. What ever happened to quality customer service? A smile, gratitude, being on top of serving their tables???? I had a coke and she never came back and asked if I wanted refills or anything. Nor did she for my husband. When I finally a other server to get our server, (after I constantly saw her chatting it up with other servers), she came and said, \"Is there anything else?\" Yeah, can I please have a refill and the check? She finally came and left. I waited and waited so I could get change to leave a tip. But still I had to flag someone else down to get her to get me change. Needless to say.....I did not tip well. ****There were NOT a lot of people there at all this Saturday afternoon. Guess I should've gone to Brian's Bbq or the Biker's place. 
Won't stop again. Don't recommend it. But love the little town vibe. Relaxing, cooler weather, clean and nice people."}
{"text":"Was exactly as we expected and the food was delicious.  Don't come here to eat healthy,  come here to indulge in authentic, finger licking good fried chicken, moist and hardy bbq beef ribs.  We wanted to experience Cave Creek and to frequent one of their original establishments.  We loved the old west decor, the bottled sarsaparilla was so good and the food did not disappoint.  Everyone, (all 7 of us) cleaned our plates.  2 adults, 3 teens and 2 kids.  I'm a bit of a fitness nut and haven't eaten fried food for years, my okie roots got the best of me  and was interested to see if the fried chicken could rival my grandmothers!   If it didn't,  it would be a close 2nd!  It was a delicious adventure, we will come again!"}
{"text":"Really great fried food- the chicken and fries were awesome! The mushroom and Swiss burger was really big and juicy and cheesey ! The blue cheese salad dressing was great on the mediocre salad. That's the good news! The bad news is the atmosphere is in desperate need of a cleaning and an update- so dark and grungy & the service was very poor. The staff was busy visiting with each other and didn't have much time to spare for my husband and I. Overall good food and unprofessional service. We will be back to try their Friday night fish fry!"}
{"text":"Whenever I crave for fried chicken, I come to this place.  For those who want 'healthy' fried chicken, which in my opinion is a contradiction in terms, this is not the place.  If on the other hand, you believe that, grease should drip out while you are sinking your teeth into a crisp, crunchy, genuinely deep fried, heart-attack-on-a-platter fried chicken, you will find it here.

Other items on the menu, such as steaks and BBQ dishes are authentic and taste wonderful.

No, this is NOT a 5-star resort status restaurant, and the prices and service correspond accordingly.  The food tastes good and you walk away full."}
{"text":"We've had opportunity to revisit The Horny Toad on several occasions over the last few months, given that it is just a few minutes from our house. While the overall opinion of the quality of the food hasn't really changed, we really enjoy the service and the atmosphere. We always opt to sit outside (because the weather is so gorgeous most of the time) and we are always accommodated (even when a server isn't necessarily assigned to that area). The wait staff is always friendly and efficient. They always take time to talk with us and our two kids. The vibe is relaxed and we enjoy brining out of town visitors to The Horny Toad. This has become one of our go-to spots for dining in Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and good service but the food is not so great.  Had wings, fries and ribs, all not good."}
{"text":"On our way home from Sedona today, my wife and I were excited to be able to detour to Cave Creek for some of that \"delicious\" fried chicken at the Horny Toad.  We have been going to that restaurant for about 15 years and it almost never disappointed.  Today we were served chicken that looked and tasted like it was either re-fried or just days old.  It was stringy, saturated with grease and basically inedible.  

Any chef that serves chicken like that does not deserve to keep his customers.  It should have been thrown in the garbage at the end of the day on which it was originally intended to be served.   

We used to drive 30 minutes from Scottsdale for their great fried chicken.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"The service was very poor!! Margarita was nothing but mix and a splash of tequila. Being a Southern girl, I might be biased on fried chicken but calling this famous fried chicken made me laugh! Honestly, I wanted to go in the kitchen and show them how to make fried chicken!!! What a joke! KFC would have been better. The cod was just as bad! Avoid if you have taste buds!"}
{"text":"A great place to come and have a cold beer, I was told that the fried chicken was what the Horny Toad was know for, I'll give there signature dish 3 stars but still a great place to have a couple of cold ones."}
{"text":"Good burgers.  Casual dining.  Nice place to grab lunch at a local restaurant.."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and really neat place.  Awesome patio and good food.  Service has always been nice and enjoy the tap beer."}
{"text":"It is amazing how your memory works.  Or how my memory works I should really say.  Randomly a restaurant came to my mind.  A restaurant that I went to back in 1986 when my family took vacation in Arizona.  That restaurant was the Horny Toad.  Once it came back into my memory I went online to see if they were still in business.  Not only were they still in business, but they were less than 10 miles from where friends of mine lived.  I knew that I would be going back for the first time in close to 30 years.

I remembered the fried chicken.  I sent my dad an e-mail to see if he remembered the place.  His response.  Yes, he did remember it and it was the best fried chicken he has ever had in his life.  Not only would I be going, but I already knew what I was ordering.

I didn't remember the actual restaurant.  There were things that went through my mind's eye, but turns out that wasn't how things actually were.  Didn't really matter.  I was there for the fried chicken and that was what I was focused on.

We came here after a hike so food was just what the doctor ordered.  The fried chicken here is \"famous\".  That is what the menu says.  You can get a half order for $11.95 or a whole chicken for $16.95.  Both come with fries and coleslaw.  I got the half which was plenty big as we had a big drive ahead of us to go down to the southern part of the state and I didn't really have any desire to fall asleep at the wheel.

A breast, thigh and leg came out to me with a heaping portion of fries and coleslaw.  It was a meal fit for a....well, me actually.  I ended up taking one piece home with me as I was pretty well stuffed after the other two and the sides.  The fried chicken was how I remember it.  Better because it wasn't salty as fried chicken can be.  Was it as good as I remember it?  It was very good, but I'll be honest in saying that we have a place back home in Oregon that I think these days is better.  That shouldn't take anything away from the Horny Toad's fried chicken.  That is just my opinion.

Very happy to make it back after all these years.  I'm sure I will be back again in shorter period of time as my friends don't plan on moving away anytime soon."}
{"text":"This will be an unbiased review of the Horny Toad in Cave Creek.
I moved to the Phoenix area in mid 2015.  Went to the Horny Toad, had the fried chicken, and it was amazing!  However, the chicken did have a slight taste of seafood, so I think they deep fried it in oil that had been used for fish.  The day I went in 2015, the restaurant was extremely busy.  Nowhere to park, lots of customers.
Went again in June 2018 at peak dinner hour on a Friday night.  The restaurant was not completely full, plenty of open tables(not a good sign).
I ordered the top sirloin steak at 18.99.  It came with beans, garlic bread and a baked potato.
Even though I asked for medium rare, the steak was medium well.  Since I never send food back because I don't want to eat somebody's spit, I ate it.  The steak was so small I actually put it between the two pieces of garlic bread and ate it as a steak sandwich.  
The potato was OK, the garlic bread was good, but only a half a long bun, cut in half.  
I didn't want the beans, and they would not substitute it for anything besides fruit or coleslaw, so I gave it to my friend.
My friend offered me some of his ribs, but they were just OK, not great.
It's really frustrating to pay 23 dollars with tax and tip to not even be full after dinner.
The service was fantastic, though.  Very professional staff, but the food was average at best.
If you go to the Horny Toad, don't order the top sirloin unless you are a senior and are not that hungry.
I advise the fried chicken, if it is still as good as it was back in 2015."}
{"text":"Fried chicken with cole slaw and mashed potatoes and gravy.  Made fresh while we waited. Nice country atmosphere and extremely friendly service.  Lots of customers not talking because their mouths were full. Only nods and smiles!"}
{"text":"low key, casual atmosphere that is family friendly. The fried chicken was pretty darn good and the kids loved the strawberry shortcake."}
{"text":"Hit or miss on service. Some of the staff is excellent, others are rude and not willing to accommodate even simple requests it substitutions. One child asked for a baked potato instead of fries and they refused. Even though other wait staff had been happy to do so previously."}
{"text":"The Horny Toad seems to fit in perfectly with the tourist-trap cowboy image of Cave Creek - from the unfinished parking lot to the souvenir shop to the old-fashioned wooden decor.

I stopped in for lunch, and started off with a cheese crisp, which was under two bucks, and contained tomatoes and onions on a corn tortilla - a decent cheap appetizer.

I ordered a BBQ pork sandwich with fries ($8.45).  The warm wheat bun was a good surprise - a lot of places seem to just use any old cheap cold hamburger bun.  The meat was cooked well, with plenty of flavor, and finished with a pretty good barbecue sauce - not particularly sweet, spicy, tangy, or really anything descriptive - just pretty good.

For dessert, I went with the strawberry shortcake.  This was not a one-portion dessert (and for $6.95, it's not priced as a one-person dessert either).  It was very tasty, but just way too big to finish, and not really something that can be taken home and finished later.

I enjoyed the food, but it's not something I'd make another special trip to get to."}
{"text":"The service was terrible and the hostess and waitress were so rude.  Had to ask for our bill 3 times and waitress had no idea what we ate so we had to tell her again.  I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Super cute and fun place. Had a prickly pear margarita. That is a MUST if you go there. Was excellent! And their fries are awesome."}
{"text":"Awesome fried chicken! Great fried mushrooms, ranch dressing was good.  Had horseradish for the mushrooms.strawberry short cake would have been better with ice cream."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and both times were OK. 
The first time was a few years ago when I was with my grandmother and then 12-year-old sister. We all ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwiches and they were good, not to die for, just good and more expensive than I thought they should be.

Today I was with a party of five (LOL yeah I can tell what you're thinking... and no, Jennifer Love Hewitt was not there!)

We all ordered burgers. I got the Toledo burger that was 100% ground beef stuffed with mild green chilies and cheddar cheese. I sampled the Horny Toad burger that had bacon and BBQ sauce on it. Everything was decent tasting and the food still has \"gourmet prices\" (like $10 for a burger and a small side!) 

It's an interesting place for tourists, screaming children and the crazy middle age couple at the table next to ours that stared at us the whole time.... But not worth driving out of your way for... only if you're driving through."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid!
The trip to Cave Creek seemed a lot longer back then.
Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon had a quick bite at the bar, burgers are awesome here. Laura behind the bar was awesome, so chatty and friendly!!
We'll always be back!!!!"}
{"text":"It has been way too long since I made the drive out to Cave Creek and stopped by The Horny Toad for the best Fried Chicken in Arizona.  At least five years and the place has not changed a bit.  Which is a good thing!  The Western honky tonk decor and funky furniture and booths just suits the place.  You can choose to dine indoors or on the patio.  We were seated for lunch right away and our service person was prompt and friendly.  I ordered a whole fried chicken.  Just for me.  I do not share at this place.  My buddy had the all-you-can eat Friday Fish N Chips which he said were delish.  The Fried Chicken (actually I think it is broasted) came out pipping hot and I am happy to report was just as tasty as the first time I ordered it thirty years ago.  Wonderful light outside coating, fantastic seasonings, and tender, juicy chicken cooked to perfection.  I ate about half of the chicken and got a to-go box to smuggle the other half back to town for a Sunday NFL football special snack.  MMM--Good!!"}
{"text":"I'm trying not to be negative but we both got food poisoning trying this place out for the first time. He had the \"special\" seafood and I had a salad with chicken. Chicken was very dry and the price was over priced in my opinion. Too bad because it had a nice outside seating area. We came from LA and if you're going to charge LA prices then make sure the food quality is worth it. I could of overcooked my own chicken like this at home and avoided listen to my husband puke all night. Ugh. Scared to give a second chance."}
{"text":"Hands down the best strawberry shortcake EVER!  We had the Horney Toad Burger and it did not disappoint!!!!   Great patio seating, very clean, incredibly attentive and friendly staff made this restaurant one of our top 10 in the entire state of AZ!!   My husband wants an entire swimming pool of the Cole slaw... Yes, it's that dang good!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in to see what this place was all about. Came in on Friday early dinner roughly about 5, not very busy YET and Came out with a hefty bill for less than mediocre food. The menu looks great at first sight, comfort food and I got excited, have I been missing out???? Here it goes.... Start with the drinks, you know there is something wrong when the margaritas are served on the same glass as the red wine is, I couldn't help but to feel ripped off. The same goes for their draft beers over charged as well for a lesser than small glass. I ordered soup of the day, since it's Friday we got clamp chowder, under seasoned really I think the cook forgot the salt.   Moving to the entrees. Prime rib ordered Med. By the looks of it it looked like it was the reheat from the night before, the entire plate warm at best nothings special about the under seasoned brussels, the beef jus served on a plastic cup was cold and when I did ask for a hot one my server did not hesitate to tell me that she boiled it in the microwave, probably where my prime rib was heated.. Flat iron steak ordered medium came out well done not a hint of pink, same warm sides as the the prime rib. The biggest joke was the Pork Chops, it's not a pork chop without the bone, call it pork loin cutlests, also under seasoned and over cooked and same sides as the others, crappy.  The fish and chips was the best dish ordered 3 out of 5, the slaw was tasteless, and hardly any \"CHIPS\" on the plate. Lastly the kids food, why is it that in some restaurants I becomes a second thought,  my kids first word out of their mouth. Oh boxed mac and cheese. Needless to say no desserts were NOT ordered.

When walking out the place was pretty full and led me to think one thing. The owner is sitting on a gold mine of regulars that may been going there for some time and don't care about the food but rather the embiance. Well, only if he could get head cook and a well trained kitchen staff that could execute the menu correctly this place would be great. 

I have never felt this much ripped off while dinning out."}
{"text":"The Horny Toad might be the oldest restaurant in Cave Creek. They've been in business for over fourty years. Because of it's rustic charm this restaurant has been featured in movies and photo shoots.They serve simple basic American Food. The Horney Toad is well known for serving Great Fried Chicken and a fabulous Strawberry Shortcake. 

I tried the 1/2 Fried Chicken. It was made from fresh plump chicken. The chicken was crispy and mighty delicious! The MOIST JUICY BREAST Meat was very flavorful and was a very large portion. I also got fresh made creamy coleslaw and mashed potatoes! It was all great!

My husband tried the Tijuana Torpedo (a BIG hamburger stuffed with a green chile and cheese). The hamburger  was prepared to his request and had a nice flavor from being cooked with mesquite. We could tell the chile came from a can but the hamburger still was very tasty and served on a good bun.

Great fried Chicken...Decent Burgers....Simple food nothing fancy.

Service was very good."}
{"text":"We were told about the neat shops in Cave Creek and that we had to go. We decided to spend an afternoon in the 104 heat walking from shop to shop to look at seriously over priced western furniture. It seemed like a good idea at the time. 
We drove through most of the shops and restaurants to see what was available and after stopping at one that was closed for lunch, we picked the Horny toad. 
The rustic atmosphere is the first thing you notice. It is kind of like an old mine shaft thing, except it had windows. Different at least. 
They had three kinds of nonalcoholic beer on the menu so I was happy right away. My wife had some trendy sarsaparilla. 
I ordered a cheese crisp which was a corn tortilla baked with cheese, onions and tomatoes. It came with a side of salsa and for $1.25 I think this may be the best appetizer I have ever had. What a simple idea. It was a taco shell broke in half with lots of melted cheese and a few onions and tomatoes. Dump a little salsa on it and wow, its great. 
We also had an order of hot wings. They were OK but I would try many things on the menu before I ordered them again. They smelt great, hot and vinegary but the taste was a little bland. The more I ate, the better they got though. Kind of a buttery, spicy vinegar taste. Like I said though, just OK. The home made blue cheese was a nice dip and it was too bad we only got two pieces of celery. 
I ordered the half rack of BBQ pork ribs. When I asked if I could switch the fries for onion rings I got a flat out no. I thought for a small charge this may be possible. I did get the pound of ribs I was promised so I can't complain about that. The ribs were average. They were BBQ'd at least, not boiled like some places. I'm not sure what this place is \"known\" for but non of the things I tried will bring me back. 
My wife had the Broiled Icelandic cod which she ate about four bites. Seriously, there was so much left on the plate that when the waiter came and picked up the plates I couldn't believe he never asked if it was OK. It was broiled with some onions and some kind of powdered cheese or something. Anyway, skip it. 
While we were there, another table proclaimed loudly that the service and the meal were absolutely excellent. We had the same waiter and he was certainly friendly but good at best. Not sure what they ate but I can be sure it wasn't what we had. I'll miss this one next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Went back and had the Reuben, really liked it.  Lightly cooked and crispy,not oily or soggy, lots of meat, sauer, and cheese.  $8.45 with a side was right on.  Service was quick."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 10 years! Some of the best most authentic western cooking on this side of town! Must try the Patty Melt & BBQ pork sandwich!"}
{"text":"Must get fried chicken! Coleslaw is awesome as well get chicken to go or eat there is def good must try if you want fried chicken"}
{"text":"We were trying to make our way to Harold's tonight for the fireworks party and ended up caught in the downpour. We didn't want to turn around and head back to The Phx so we stopped at The Horny Toad as it was the only place I could find a parking spot. Walked in soaking wet and waited about 30 min. Just my luck,,,,,woo hoo, I get the sour faced server from hell! A server can just ruin ruin ruin your meal. Uhh.....She didn't so much as crack a smile the whole time we were there. When taking our order, she asked what my mother wanted and I replied that she was debating between three things. My mother started telling her what she was debating between. Instead of listening and offering suggestions, she cut her off and said, well are you ready? Seriously? She never asked of she wanted something to drink. She dropped off our food and didn't ask if we wanted anything else. We had to flag down the manager and others to get us things we needed. Awful awful. 

Ohh yes, the food. It was ok. We both ordered the prime rib. It was a little over cooked for med rare. We had to flag down someone else because she forgot the horseradish sauce. I've had much better. The food was not great and not bad, just ok. It might have tasted better with a server who gave a damn about her customers."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is amazing!!! And i love the bbq!! Nice menu variety!! Definitely a must try for Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"Good food, except fried chicken was a little greasy. The problem wasn't the food, but was the waitress AJ. We couldn't believe the attitude she had towards us. After she finally came over and took our order, she didn't return for over half an hour.  An update on the status of our order would have been nice. Was our order even turned in? We tracked her down at another table to ask and she completely snapped on my Dad telling him \"It hasn't been that long!\" and then told us how busy they were, with not a lot of customers there. The food finally came out after waiting over an hour.  She gave my son a small cup of bbq sauce and then I asked her for some. She responded with \"Isn't that enough?\" AJ disappeared again. She finally came back and we asked for the bill and to-go boxes. She brought only the bill so we reminded her about the boxes and she responded, \"I only have two hands!\"   She then practically threw the boxes at us. AJ needs to learn proper customer service or find another type of job."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with my daughter, mainly because everyone was raving about the strawberry shortcake. Dinner was fine, basic food. French fries were divine, best fries we've had in Arizona yet. Then we ordered the shortcake. It was truly awful, it tasted like bad cornbread biscuit hard as a rock, the strawberries tasted like frozen barely defrosted in the microwave and the whip cream like cool whip. I was really disappointed especially because it was so talked up by everyone. I'll go for the fries but never get the shortcake again."}
{"text":"The portions were large enough that even after splitting the half chicken there was some going home. I wish that they had a better beer selection. I had chili which must have been fixed first because it was not as hot as I prefer. The cheese melted - so, it wasn't cold.  The tables near us were boisterous - they didn't have a problem with the beer selection. I must admit to having some dessert envy when I saw their strawberry shortcake come out.  I will be back.  I enjoyed how quick Our group of six could get in. I also liked how many choices there were on the menu."}
{"text":"Meh, I stopped in at Horny Toad with my lady to have a drink. It was mid-day on a Sunday & the bar area was empty except for us. We didn't eat, but we had a couple of draft beers. The beers were over $4 each & they were served in small glasses. We didn't even get a full pint! Lameness, Horny Toad."}
{"text":"A Valley staple! After the loss of the beloved Pinnacle Peak Patio, this is one of the few remaining western-style joints that I cherish. Ive only gotten the fried chicken here, so I cant comment on the overall menu, but Ill tell you this: the chicken is the bomb. Never too greasy, and fried to perfection. The fries are great, too! The location is in an old Wild West-ish feeling setting in Cave Creek. The views are beautiful, and the prices are great. Outdoor dining is great in the cooler months. Im not a fan of the dirty gravel lot, but I guess it lends to the overall feel of the place. There is the typical kitschy gift shop next door selling overpriced, authentic (some) Native American items, but its still fun to stroll around in. If youre in the north Valley, be sure to stop in, Im sure you'll like the old West ambience."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, cool vibe, great food. Loved this place. We will be back. 

Revisited this place last night-what a nightmare. We decided to sit at the bar and have a drink and the drinks were awful. I had a \"lemon drop\" and my partner had a margarita madness something or other with pineapple juice in it, both served in cloudy dirty glasses and the bartender had wet hands. The glasses were dirty and the bartender was beyond awkward, almost like she was tweaking- and it smelled like a bathroom in a dirty gas station. I have no intention of going again. There was a lady behind us selling t shirts that was sitting there with the most unpleasant look on her face. For my money I would go to the Hideaway or the Taphaus."}
{"text":"We took
Our family here for dinner tonight. It's delicious! I honestly thought it would be busy for a Friday night but we got right in. The kids had the sliders and wow! Talk about a delicious burger on fresh butter buns. I got the wings and they were crispy, and the sauce was great just WAY SPICY so beware. My husband loved his half chicken and the fries were perfect too!"}
{"text":"Fried Chicken and Strawberry Shortcake.. don't both with anything else on the menu or you're just asking for heartburn! 

I still love this place.. my mother would take us here when we were just wee lads.. the place seemed so big and mysterious back then. The HT  hasn't changed to much over the past few decades but the fried chicken is still really good.. 

Now I get to take my mother here on different occasions and it still has the that feeling of comfort and down home goodness."}
{"text":"So after venturing up to cave creek in hopes of going to the spotted donkey (which we never found.. Thx to the wrong map on yelp!) We were starving and just wanted to eat so we found this joint. And eat I got. It was worse then those restaurants that were names \"eat\" that I would see along the roadside as a kid(which I never ate at). Nothing for vegetarins here other than fried fish. I had green chile soup, a cheese crisp(that was more a pile of greasey cheese than anything) and a ceaser salad. My friend had a steak that resembled the steaks in a commerical for Coco's. After eating this food I felt absoultly sick. I won't be back. I rather eat at EAT."}
{"text":"This place is OK. I was not super impressed though. I had a Porterhouse 
That was I'd say mediocre. Anyway, not bad but not great."}
{"text":"They try very very hard!  The food is good and the customer care is really top notch!  Cave Creeker's LOVE the Toad and we are grateful for those from the valley that understand how hard it is to run a business year-a-round in the Creek!  I love the Fried Chicken and the Burgers!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  Awesome ribs and strawberry shortcake!  The waitress, Jayce was outstanding!"}
{"text":"This is a funky rustic place.  It has been here for some time and fits in with the old west style of other parts of Cave Creek.  There is outside seating with music in the evenings or inside seating.  Friday they have all you can eat fish and chips which were pretty good.  Cole slaw was quite good that came with it.  They have some interesting and and creative cocktail choices.  Service was good.  The dessert was very good.  The cinnamon swirl ice cream was great and even better on top of the apple cobbler which was huge and delicious though heavy on the cinnamon."}
{"text":"Is there a cooler place to eat outside?  I'll bet you are hard pressed to find one and the food here is certainly worth the trip!"}
{"text":"We have been going here since the 90s and its the  same.  We start with the combo apps, I love the Ranch dressing here.  Now its hot when you bite into those lovely zucchini and mushrooms so cut them open first.  
We then get 2 chickens, so we have some to take home,  Love the Coleslaw!  The fired chicken is fresh and hot!  So good.  I love the BBQ sauce as well.  Worth the 50 miles trek to this little place."}
{"text":"Went there with my honey this past weekend only because it's been around so long and had heard of it and thought I'd like to try it to see what it's all about.   

Well, I'm glad I did.  And, no, I wouldn't return.  I'm surprised it's still in business what with the lack of quality and presentation of the food.    I had the half fried chicken, and he had the deep fried icelandic cod.   My chicken had a nice crust on it, but it lacked any sort of imagination or flavor.   Very bland and boring.   It came with clam chowder, which had so much flour it was hard to find the potatoes and the clams.    In fact, if there were three or four pieces of clam in the cup, I'd be surprised.    The dish also came with french fries.   Again, boring and lack of imagination in taste.   UGHHH.    

My honey had the fish, as I mentioned.  It, too, had a nice batter to it, but, again, alas, lack of flavor and/or presentation.   Very so so.   It came with tartar sauce, which tasted like some nondescript brand out of a jar.   It had a tiny plastic side cup of coleslaw, which was falling out of the cup and slopped in.   Again, ughhh in flavor and presentation.   

Other places close by had full and packed parking lots.  The Horny Toad was basically empty.   There were groups of people so I'm thinking there were families there from out of town.    Too bad the food is so nondescript, blah and boring."}
{"text":"Sorry but the service was absolutely the worst ever. We were not even acknowledged. We left."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Cave Creek and when I get the chance to drive up there, I love to explore it's unique places. I love all the places to shop and eat and the Horny Toad is no exception there. The name captured my attention and we pulled into the dirt lot and parked. 2 adorable stores are also on property next to the restaurant. Prepare to step back into the Wild West days with the wood panels, floors and funky décor. A friend and I came for lunch and the patio was crowded so we sat inside. Service here was very good and quick! You can smell BBQ throughout the entire restaurant so the pulled pork sandwich was calling my name! We got our food within 10 minutes. Here's where things went south...the BBQ was very average. Coleslaw was OK. I didn't finish my plate. I do hear the fried chicken is what's popular but of course didn't know that until after I had already eaten. Bummer.

If you're looking for a unique experience in a great little town, go here. If you're looking for amazing food, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Out door seating with views, Indoor is cozy, friendly, good comfort food."}
{"text":"Just had probably the best fried chicken ever. If you're in Cave Creek the Horny Toad is a must stop, trust me the chicken will not disappoint. What the kids say these days straight fire!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years now and have to say that the food and service is consistently above par. A great place to bring friends and family from out of town. Definitely a place to show a good first impression. Rustic western atmosphere. Good times!"}
{"text":"Even if you aren't hungry, this is a great destination!  But who could come here and not enjoy the fried chicken?  Crunchy on the outside...moist and tender and full of flavor on the inside!  You'll need a friend to help eat the strawberry shortcake!"}
{"text":"Went there last week for lunch. We decided to eat out on the patio. It was a little cool and breezy and the picnic table wasn't comfortable. Our waitress was a little slow to get to us so we had plenty of time of read the menu. The menu is pretty basic and so is the food. Portions are large, the BBQ didn't taste too sweet or tangy to me. The ambiance is very friendly and cowboy casual. The coleslaw tasted freshly made and wasn't too sweet. 

My husband also had the veggie soup and he declared it to be some of the best soup he's ever had! I've had better bbq sandwiches in other restaurants and I thought this was just ok. Service was slow and when it came time to leave, it took awhile to find our waitress to get the bill. But I'd like come here again and try the burgers next time."}
{"text":"Good food for what it is: simple southwest country fare; burgers, steak, fish, salads, etc, nothing fancy and not too many options. Typical old west decor, a little dark, stone walls, colored glass. Bigger than I thought it would be, not too busy on a Sunday afternoon. Not a bad place overall, not fancy but might be all you need!"}
{"text":"Being a huge fan of bar food in general, this place hit all the notes for me. The food was great and reminded me of food you'd find at a good old southern barbecue. Simple yet satisfying. 

The chicken was amazing! Apparently they're well known for it. 

If you're in cave creek, it's definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"We visited from Indiana. Went because we read that the fried chicken is amazing. We ended up not getting any fried chicken. Instead we got ribs, country fried steak, mashed potatoes, and the cowboy beans. It was so delicious! The service and atmosphere was also great! Loved it! Really wish we didn't live across the country."}
{"text":"French fries were great, chicken fried steak was small and not up to par, cream gravy was runny.  Beer was warm and margaritas sucked...all mix and no tequila.  Service was horrible!!!!  Pass this place up folks!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for a drink during bike week & the \"crew\" wasn't really impressed so we left to meet others at the hide away so didn't get a chance to really check this place out."}
{"text":"I've vacationed in Arizona for many years and try to make it to the Horny Toad once a trip.  Although its a bit of a tourist trap, the barbecue is delicious. I usually stick to the half rack of ribs and they are always fall off the bone good.  The sides are good but nothing special. 

On my last trip out there I tried their famous strawberry shortcake, and it's definitely famous for a reason! This dessert is so big you'll need a small army or one really hungry person to eat it all. The shortcake was hot and fresh and there was plenty of strawberries and whip cream to go around.    Our waitress said some people even order it before their meal so they're sure they have room for it.  As long as mom's not around, you might as well eat dessert first, right!"}
{"text":"Service is friendly and prompt. The salad I had was out of a bag. My hubby had rib and fried chicken special. He loved it and the bbq sauce too. I am not in a hurry to return but my husband would."}
{"text":"It's true..... the chicken is really great. But so are the French fries, onion rings, deep fried zucchini and mushrooms. My dinner salad was HUGE and the house made blue cheese dressing was very good. We had to wait a few minutes to get a server but once he finally showed up we had great service. All in all a very enjoyable pre-Fathers Day celebration. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We come here for the one thing .... the fried chicken.  It's really \"broasted\" instead of deep fried which makes it non-greasy and moist.  The ribs are okay and the strawberry short cake is worth saving room for.  I love fish and chips, but don't care for theirs.  We aren't crazy about the cowboy ambiance, but then we're just there for the chicken."}
{"text":"Came  here for the fried chicken , it was delicious. My husband and I shared the whole chicken. It came with mashed potatoes or coleslaw. We chose the coleslaw and that too was yummy.  Rustic typical
Cave Creek deco, can't wait to come back and sit outside when the weather improves."}
{"text":"One of the best places for fried chicken in town!  It is served piping hot and very plump and juicy!  They serve you the whole chicken, so it is nice to go there with someone who likes to split it with you!  It is served with their yummy french fries and their homemade slaw!  They have an all American menu with even fried calf's liver!  The pork and beef ribs are also great and please save room for their yummy apple cobbler, or strawberry shortcake as this is a meal in itself! It's really nice to sit outside in their courtyard, but also fun to sit inside their rustic decor. They used to serve you fresh hot popcorn while you wait for your table, but the last couple of times I went, it was only cold pretzels.... When there is a long line up, we go next door to The Hideaway for a drink beforehand:-)"}
{"text":"Love Cave Creek!! Good food and good drinks. Fun old town atmosphere! Super busy little hang out!"}
{"text":"been here a few times and enjoy it every time, our server Jessica was very nice and on point, we started with the mushroom app a little plain tasting, we had the chicken both ways fried and BBQ both of them very good , live music played on the patio which I were I would recommend sitting it's a nice setting, all in all good will be back again"}
{"text":"To some this is a real AZ hangout.  To others it's nothing but an overpriced tourist trap with bad food.  There's a little bit of truth to both of those statements.  Bottom line... it's a decent place to take out-of-town guests to experience an old West atmosphere and eat fried chicken.  Order any other food at your own discretion!  Oh yeah, the beer is OK to drink as well."}
{"text":"The ambiance here is nice--they do the \"old West roadhouse\" thing very well. The food is mediocre, as is the service.  The barbecue was bland and disappointing--I can mention at least 6 other places in the Phoenix area whose faire is much more pleasing to the palate.  The portions are small--much less than we were led to believe from their advertising.  The prices were mind-boggling:  $60 for 1 appetizer, 2 lunch entrees, and a cup of coffee.  No dessert, no drinks.  We left feeling both hungry and short-changed.  Everyone was pleasant enough, but we certainly didn't feel like we got what we paid for at the Horny Toad."}
{"text":"very dark \"old\" atmosphere and dirty feeling. The food was marginal and over priced. The service was SLOW. Disappointing."}
{"text":"The first time I went to The Horny Toad was in 1982. I had the whole fried chicken and French Fries and I loved it. Lived in the Phoenix area for 5 years and used to venture up here periodically for the fried chicken. It's delicious, but it's also all about the fried chicken. It has a cool atmosphere and some great things to see before and after eating. The desserts are good as well. When you go just close your eyes and realize there is nothing for a dieter and embrace that concept."}
{"text":"Had a burger it was edible. Had strawberry shortcake it was ok....overall a very mediocre dining experience"}
{"text":"I am not sure why they pack them in here. Yes I had the fried chicken and it was good , the fries would have been better if they were cooked more they were kinda limp and the coleslaw was creamy but lacked taste. My husband went for the fish n chips thinking they would have the same coating as the fried chicken-wrong. They tasted like they were frozen chunks of fish and they were horrible. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch excellent Blue Cheese and Bacon Burger and Fried Chicken.  Friendly bartender and good drinks!"}
{"text":"I'd read so many good reviews so I was expecting much better than I experienced.  We ordered,Fried Mushrooms Zucchini and Onions, BBQ Pork Ribs, Liver & Onions, Fried Chicken, a burger, Strawberry Shortcake and a Brownie Sundae.  The Fried Zucchini and Onions were good, but the mushrooms were cold and some of the batter was raw.  The ribs were dry.  The Liver and Onions was surprisingly tasty, but the mashed potatoes were \"fake\".  They tasted like they came from a box.  The burger was good, but so is In and Out.  The Strawberry Shortcake was supposedly award winning, but the strawberries were from a can/jar, they were soaked, not fresh and a weird tinge of purple.  The cake alone was delicious and hot.  This dessert should have been served with ice cream.  The Brownie Sundae was the most delicious part of the whole meal.  The brown was hot, and soft and served with ice cream and whipped cream.  The fried chicken was tasty, but not hot enough.  I can't say I will ever go back, other than to have the Brown Sundae again.  The server forgot about us and we went thirsty most of the meal.  This seems like a tourist trap, so no matter how many bad reviews they get, I think they will continue to be busy."}
{"text":"Went back when my parents flew into town and wanted to check it out.  After reading some reviews on their Fried Chicken I had to give it a try and I am glad I did.  The meat was moist and the skin was crispy and tasty.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone that goes up to Cave \"tourist trap\" Creek.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Had the rueben and the fried chicken. Both came with fries, and the food was super hot! Loved the western-ish atmosphere and the music was great ( mix of old school and new country). The service was okay, server was busy though. The only bad thing was the iced tea...it tasted old. But, if that was the only bad thing then we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"You know those restaurants where the memory is just so good and the times you had were just so fun that you can't wait to share it, in all it's glory, with your significant other? 

Well, don't do it. Don't give in. Don't listen to that feeling. The captured moment of yore will be emblazoned within your little noodle forever.... please don't sully it. Time is a cruel mistress. 

I used to come here all the time with my family when I was little. We recently made a visit for a small lunch to bide our time and I left very disappointed. Not only because I had high expectations, but because this place is just not good. 

We sat outside on the patio on a beautiful day. Our server was very relaxed. And by that, I mean she took ages to gather our drink orders and then again for our meal orders. When I finally got my cup of chili, it was cold. The cheese on top wasn't melted. They heaped twice as much diced onion on top as they had of the cheese. Let me tell you, this is not the ideal ratio. Again, our server disappeared. The burger was not cooked as requested... 

Nah, I'm good. Let's just erase that memory."}
{"text":"This place is a great source for BBQ pork and fried chicken in the greater Phoenix area.  The pork is pulled well with very little gristle or fat, and the friend chicken is crispy and delicious.

The BBQ sauce is sweet and tangy, more of a Texas style to me than anything else.

Nothing super special about this place but its a good meal and the service is pretty good!"}
{"text":"I enjoy going to the Horny Toad for a cold drink after a nice hike.  Love sitting outside and take in the view.  Haven't eaten there but I've heard the food is good.  The waitstaff is very friendly and helpful!  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"In addition to a name that makes everyone chuckle, The Horny Toad serves up some quality barbecue that the valley seems to be seriously lacking.

All I can say about the beef ribs is that they're out of this world!  Good beef ribs are hard to find in this part of desert (apparently a lot more people in arizona are partial to pork), and I enjoyed making a mess of myself devouring the meat off the bones.  The sauce is incredible.  The Horny Toad serves up a barbecue sauce that could turn almost any meat or poultry from good to amazing.

We sat on a picnic table outside.  Other than a strong breeze that sent napkins flying all over the place, it was a nice setting to enjoy some cue.  The price seems a little high, but the portions are massive.  The Food will keep you stuffed for the rest of the day, and then some."}
{"text":"I went with a friend yesterday for wings and margaritas.  I ordered 1/2 BBQ wings & 1/2 hot wings.  The hot wings were below part and didn't taste that great.  The BBQ wings were absolutely disgusting. I think the chef doesn't know how to make them,  because they just came with about a cup of nasty, thick, old BBQ sauce dumped on top of them. My stomach is still turning just thinking about them.  I should've sent them back, but didn't want to bother for 5 wings. Oh yeah, they give you 9 wings only for the price of a dozen. NO HAPPY HOUR EITHER. The margaritas cost more than the wings. 
I gave them 2 stars because at least their overpriced fried chicken is good. But we won't be back for wings and drinks."}
{"text":"Really good fried chicken & the meatloaf isn't bad either. Is it anything to write home about, no, but the food was good enough for me to go back. The service is a little below average. They never brought our coffee with our dessert, and we had to ask for drink refills, but that's to be expected from time to time. I would recommend some deep cleaning (tables and chairs were a little dirty)."}
{"text":"We went to lunch here on Saturday after my son's baseball game. It started out bad as the hostess was on the phone for over five minutes taking reservations while people stood there waiting.  Then she proceeded to seat someone in front of us. OK then we finally got seated and waited 15 minutes for Someone to come to us. Then another hour to get our food As they brought others food out in front of ours that got seated well after we did. Then of course the food was cold. We couldn't wait to get out of there. Poor management.  Do not go to this place. Tourist usually get roped in on it, and locals usually know better, we do now."}
{"text":"Went to the Horny Toad for dinner tonight.  The fried chicken was very good.  Tried a little of the barbecue sauce and that was good too.  Unfortunately too full for the desert.  Will have to save that for another time."}
{"text":"I went to the Horny Toad with a party of five.  Sadly there are few redeeming qualities to this place, all of which are in no way associated the actual restaurant.  The decor makes the place look like an abandon mine shaft.  The food was horrible.  The salads consisted of shredded iceberg lettuce and a few uninspiring toppings.  The restaurant did provide a bucket of salad dressing to allow the diner to drown the insipid salad in.  The grade of the ribs was sub-standard and permanently marked from the jockey whip.  During dinner we had several uninvited guests visit us (beetles/roaches).  We found one on our menu, one in the basket of fries, and several more littered around the establishment.  Since I did not see any outside the restaurant, I can only conclude that they lived in the kitchen.  Cave Creek is a beautiful setting.  I highly recommend taking the time to drive up there, but give the Horny Toad a pass, unless you are a gourmand in entomophagy. (I wish yelp allowed zero star ratings)"}
{"text":"We took some out of town family there yesterday (12/26/15). Boy, were we disappointed! Only thing that was good was my granddaughters chicken strips. Rack of ribs dry and not much flavor. Fajitas, well don't order it if you expect real a Mexican serving. Lettuce looked like it came out of a bag. Guacamole and sour cream came in little store bought containers. I always got black beans not black olives as a side. In fairness I have been there in the spring and had better food."}
{"text":"What a disappointment I had the fried chicken.when it arrived at the table I thought I had gotten the wrong order.A basket that contained four tiny pieces of way overcooked chicken.I couldn't
even tell what price was which.I left hungry stopped at Micky D's on the way home"}
{"text":"I was in Cave Creek to visit family and we decided to eat at The Horny Toad. I honestly wasn't sure what to expect based on the name, but I took a leap-of-faith and went with it anyways. It definitely has an a unique look to it, with a very heavy Western influence. The staff was nice and friendly and the place was clean.

At first I thought the menu was a bit expensive but ordered the Mushroom Swiss burger anyways. Much to my surprise, the burger was huge! Not only was it huge, but it was tasty too. 

There were 7 other people in my group and everybody liked what they ordered. There were free refills on soda which was a nice touch. Overall, I recommend eating here if you're looking for good American food. There's also a nice outdoor patio to eat on if the weather is nice (it was a bit cold when we were there)."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat after a long long road trip to the Grand Canyon, also a great family restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here after reading a review in the AaA magazine. We'd never been to cave creek before, so decided to take a quick trip. There are many restaurants in this vicinity so was a bit surprised as I expected more even though yelp said 3 stars. I had the pulled pork sandwich and my husband had half of a fried chicken. There was nothing wrong with the food, it was good but very ordinary. The French fries weren't crisp at all but they were homemade.  Our server did everything we asked, got the food out fast and our check when we asked. It had a great ambience and the food was middle of the road. It wasn't our type of place but can see how many others would really enjoy it."}
{"text":"Faux  old west interior in a tourist trap area.  But the food was decent bar food and it would be fun on a nice afternoon."}
{"text":"When we were passing through town we stopped at The Horny Toad for lunch. I have to say my experience was just \"ok\".  The chicken noodle soup lacked any substance.  My girlfriend had the chile and commented that said \"shes had better\".  We sat outside on the picnic tables which is a cute spot but certaily nothing special.  I doubt I would make a special trip to town just to go to this place.  Server however was expeptional and staff very friendly."}
{"text":"When you need comfort food and a great time with your family or friends, this is the spot. When my family comes from out of state, they always have to make it a point to stop here. Fried chicken is great and the bbq ribs are my favorite. Huge portions of deliciousness. Strawberry shortcake and the cobbler are a party in your mouth!"}
{"text":"The meatloaf was cold and underwhelming. The service was slow and unfriendly. I was excited to eat here because of the reviews but I will never go again."}
{"text":"Stopped off here late on a Sunday night when my parents and I were driving through town. I saw that the fried chicken was popular so we ordered that. It was pretty juicy, worth trying for sure. It was quite greasy though....Like exploded with grease when I took a bite. 

Pros: fun atmosphere 
-Quality napkins
-Pretty good service 
-Chicken was juicy 


Cons: Dirty bathroom 
-Coleslaw was like shredded lettuce dumped with mayo
-Super uncomfurtable seating"}
{"text":"Awful.  Rude and incompetent staff, food was gross, ribs were rubbery and overcooked.  Clearly unless you know the people that work there they don't want you there.  
We reordered food after sending the first lot back,  couldn't get drinks,  food took so long we canceled it and as we were walking out the food showed up,  I told them we didn't want it and the manager says \"really? \" and slammed the food on the bar.
Asked for the check for what we'd had and was told to go to the bar to pay,  I refused and wanted to pay where I was,  was promptly sworn at.  I was getting annoyed as was my wife and we asked for the freaking bill only to be told to quit yelling and was told this is f@#kin shit. I said I was ready to put money on the counter and walk out to which I was told that was a stupid idea. 
Paid for what we ate and left an absolutely dreadful restaurant with awful employees,  awful food and terrible service. 
Not even worth 1 star.  
Do NOT give these idiots your business.  Loads of way better places to spend your hard earned cash in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"I'm visiting here from Va and it was my first time visiting here. The food was fresh , service was amazing, and quick! The fried chicken is a MUST try. The restaurant is so cute. I will go back !"}
{"text":"Great variety - good for families - perfect Fried Chicken!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in Cave Creek! Love the atmosphere and service was great. Just took a long time to get Bill payed"}
{"text":"YUMMY !!!!! pERFECT,,,order FISH&CHIPS  I am from Pacific northwest we are fish country.These fish&CHIPS AWESOME..Went back for fried chicken KEEP UP GREAT WORK ..your kitchen staff 10stars we come from glendale..LOVE horny toad."}
{"text":"Go for the apple crisp dessert but that's about it.  Companions weren't thrilled with their ribs and steak I had was way past it's prime and had to be replaced with another.  Garlic bread is delicious and buttery but not worth the rest of the meal.  Come here for dessert and have dinner somewhere else. I'"}
{"text":"We always have a good time here! Good food, good service and fun atmosphere. We love sitting on the porch and people watching over a casual meal."}
{"text":"I ordered the Taco Salad.
Worst Taco Salad ever. Nothing about it was Taco, except that it came in a taco shell.
No beans, no Mexican rice. Just lettuce, black olives, tomatoes, and cheese.
Sour cream and mushy guacamole on the side. No flavor."}
{"text":"food excellent for location and if you want next door has a bar just for bikers, don't say anything stupid."}
{"text":"A unique locals restaurant.   The decor is cowboy style.  Reasonably priced food.  Everyone seems pleasant.  For a treat you really have to get their home made strawberry shortcake.   It comes heated,  and the portion size that you can split 4 ways with everyone getting plenty."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, but falls short of five stars. It serves large portions of pretty decent comfort food, a variety of salads for which they put dressing on the side w/out asking, and good deserts that fit well with the overall ambiance and menu. Last time I had liver with onions - liver was coded in flower and egg wash which was too salty. The liver was a tad overlooked, so it as rubbery. Fried chicken was amazing and so moist! Salads were fresh. Both types of chicken on them, grilled and fried, were moist and very nicely seasoned. Cod in Fish n Chips dish was perfect. It's a casual place that offers relaxed and comfortable atmosphere both inside and outside."}
{"text":"In town for work. Nice place to get a good meal. I had the pot roast which was good. Ate alone but got a booth. Nice waiter and a constant flow of people coming and going."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on July 3rd.  Great place to hang out for best firework show I have seen in Az (in my opinion).  Place was busy so I would to give our server a break but she vanished!!! Their management is too blame in our opinion.  We found out she was working tables all over the restaurant.  They need to section the restaurant off better for their servers.  They have people running all over the place doing their best but not really serving the customers. 

The Cobb salad was surprisingly good as was the chili.  If you like greasy.. Go for the fried chicken."}
{"text":"I'm a native, and this is one of my guilty pleasures. 

I've been going to The Horny Toad with my parents since I can remember. My mom and I stopped in for lunch and it wasn't very busy. Our server came right out and was very pleasant. 

I don't think I've ever ordered anything here besides the deep fried zucchini and the fried chicken.  (Like I said one of my guilty pleasures)

The deep fried zucchini are delicious, but be careful, they can be super hot when they hit your plate.

The fried chicken on the menu is listed as \"Our Famous Fried Chicken\" \"Plucked & Fresh NOT Frozen\". They're not using that term lightly, it's definitely famous in my mind. Carve into that bird and the succulent juices start running down your knife. With your fist bite your whole mouth bursts with flavor.  I could almost eat the whole bird... seriously they serve you an entire chicken.  You can order the \"half\" option but you'll be disappointed without the left overs.

I don't think they've changed the recipe in 20 years and I'll be back for many more years to come."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've had in a long time. Service, while friendly, was slow or non existent. Food was over cooked and way over priced. I had to go to the bar for more water and beer. My waitress was MIA. And to top it off we couldn't get our darn bill to get the heck out. We will never return. If 0 stars was possible I would have picked that."}
{"text":"Nice ride to Cave Creek.  Excellent chicken with mashed potatoes & gravy.  The Hamburger was excellent also.  Service was great.  We'll see you again soon."}
{"text":"Very cool place!  Good food (I had pork chops) really great deserts!"}
{"text":"Started with a good Moscow Mule but went downhill from there. Wanted to order the special with two pieces of chicken and ribs. Was told you couldn't request white meat if you ordered the special- you got what they gave you. So maybe they should have just said the special came with two pieces of dark meat! Were also told you couldn't order, and pay for, an extra piece of chicken to add to the meal. And all this came from a surly waitress. When the entrees came out of course our special came with two pieces of dark meat- when we asked again why no option for white we were told you take what you get. They serve white meat because we had it in our (full price) half chicken dinner. The chicken was good- not great. The ribs were terrible as were the fries and the mashed potatoes and gravy. Cole slaw was okay. Never asked if we wanted drink refills. All in all, customer service stinks and there are a lot of much better food options nearby."}
{"text":"So maybe the customer service isn't all that bubbly but when you step into \"The Horny Toad\" you are stepping back in time when customer service was mediocre at best, right?  So with that said, the food is what we really need to focus on and it's delicious!  They have the best cottage cheese that I've ever had and their potato salad is amazing.  Also, their tangy and sweet BBQ sauce is perfection.  Love the ambiance and the old western feel... definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"All I can say is fried chicken!  Again, we have been going here for years and never once had bad service.  Friendly staff and always good food.  The fried chicken is juicy and tasty and is my staple when we go."}
{"text":"I've probably been coming here for over 20 years, first time was with my Dad years ago. The food is always very good. Back in the day before gluten became an issue, I used to enjoy the fried chicken. Boy how I miss that chicken! But alas, sometimes with age comes digestive issues. I still enjoy the BBQ, often get the pork or beef sandwiches, just without the bread, the fries are good and the slaw is just right, not too sweet, not too vinegary (is that a word?)  It's always fun to sit outside on the patio on a beautiful day. Sometimes they have musicians play outside and that's always a treat. Service is always good. This place is a definitely must if you have out of town visitors! The whole town of Cave Creek is kind of a throw back, really neat."}
{"text":"Great food and even better people and atmosphere. Nice little Cave Creek spot. Definitely try to get there before the crowds."}
{"text":"Half fried chicken. Came with coleslaw and choice of mash and gravy or fries.
BEST onion rings ever
Amazing porch view
Friendliest and efficient servers

YUMMY"}
{"text":"Great food great service just had fantasic bacon blue burger also had torpedo burger and pulled pork sandwich and shared. All recommended"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed our dinner here.  The burger was ok.  They fried chicken was really good.  Great BBQ sauce too.  Our waitress was really friendly.  We enjoyed eating outside, before the sun went down and it got too cool."}
{"text":"We hadn't been there in years, my wife had the horny toad Burger and I had the combo chicken and ribs, best chicken and ribs ever, wife loved the hamburger, service
 great, ambiance great.....one thing tho, the door to the toliet stall is so high up it provides no privacy if one had to go number 2.... so as long as u don't have to do number 2, you'll be alright..."}
{"text":"Yikes! The new owners are terminating all the older well seasoned waitstaff and now they got rid of the best chef in Cave Creek who had been there 30 years! My late father ran 5 star resorts in this area with world class restaurants. Believe me the food and dining experience at the Horny Toad will never be the same quality we all have enjoyed for decades. There are better cowboy restaurants in Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time earlier in the week.   BBQ Beef ribs were awesome.  Kids food was good.   Service was pretty good.   Dog friendly patio was great.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Iconic and fun spot for soaking up the local atmosphere, drinking a cold beer and eating their unbelievable FRIED CHICKEN.  I dream of this chicken--it reminds me of the chicken my grandmother made on her Missouri farm, killing and cleaning the chickens just before seasoning and placing into hot fat on the stove. Never frozen, unbelievably moist inside and delicious crunchiness on the outside--I will miss this meal as I have just moved out of state. (Oh yeah--review not complete without mentioning how very good the fries are alongside)."}
{"text":"We read many reviews about Horny Toad, so gave it a try. We really enjoyed the delicious fried and BBQ chicken. They are very generous with the mashed potatoes and gravy as well. Cole slaw was sweet, creamy, and tasty. We split the a half order of the signature strawberry shortcake for dessert as well. Came away very satisfied. Loved the indoor ambience and country music too. It did take a while for our order to be served, but it was hot, fresh, and tasty. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went here today to try the famous fried chicken. I was looking forward to trying it.
Although the chicken was very moist it did not have the crispy deep fried  outer skin you expect from fried chicken. I was disappointed to say the least.."}
{"text":"The attitude and service provided by our server was subpar at best. We felt as though we were an inconvenience. Short one word answers and at one point she simply pointed at the menu and walked away. We waited so long for a second beverage I just went to the bar. Food was average at best. 1st and only visit that's for certain."}
{"text":"I had a problem with the service on my last visit a couple months ago, but that was not the case tonight. 
We arrived as a large group this time, but our server handled it pretty well, even with a few last minute additions and changes. 
I came with a couple people who don't eat pork, so I didn't get my usual baby back ribs (cutting a streak of over 15yrs!)... Instead, I got the beef ribs. My husband and his parents also got the same. They were enormous! But also good. I still prefer the baby back, but the beef isn't bad at all.  My husband and his parents also enjoyed them. 
My mother enjoyed her fajita, and my dad and brother shared and enjoyed the whole fried chicken. 
My daughter got chicken nuggets. They were dinosaur shaped, so I doubt they were made there, but she didn't mind."}
{"text":"Service was extremely mediocre. I asked for a menu recommendation and received a look of contempt and a very stock answer. We ordered fried chicken and a burger, and both were mediocre as well. My girlfriend asked for her burger cooked medium and they gave it to her raw. My chicken was almost tasteless with no seasoning-I've gotten better chicken from the grocery store for half the price. Will never come back. For $30 we got terrible, inattentive service and food that tasted like something they heated up from Winco."}
{"text":"We had a party of 50 here tonight. The manager Jim planned and executed the most awesome night for us. Ashley and Kathy were our servers. We had excellent food, awesome service and an enjoyable time. We were in an out of this restaurant in less than two hours. Thank you for a remarkable evening!"}
{"text":"This place could be a lot cooler than it actually is.  It always feels a bit clasustrophobic in here.  Walking from the entrance to the dining room is difficult because of the narrow pathway and all the people walking back and forth.  The service is usually pretty decent though.  The food is okay. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in town! its exactly what every true fried chicken lover wants there chicken to be! 
service, well its exactly what i expected, no frills at all. but if your not needy, snobby or pretentious you'll fit right in.
this place is overflowing with small town character and pride, which i think is a good thing.
con- beer should have been colder.
all in all a pretty neat old restaurant"}
{"text":"Fried Chicken & Ribs - delicious and out of the ordinary for me to order. Very cool old western bar up in Cave Creek (super easy to get to). Worth the trip."}
{"text":"Not as touristy as some of the other places on old town cave creek, but a decent blend of cheesiness and vintage old west decor.  

The fried chicken is what we came for, based on other yelp reviews, and it proved to be just what we were looking for.  

Call me crazy, but I do tend to measure fried chicken against KFC, not that KFC is the gold standard, but it does provide a good measuring stick.  

Toad's fried chicken has a good crispy exterior that generously coats the entire piece.  I would have liked a little more salt and juiciness to the meat itself (brine or buttermilk?), but if you ensure that each bite is a blend of skin/meat, you'll be happy.  

Fried are some of the best in CC, and the slaw is right up there as well.   

All in all, this meal hit the spot and we WILL come back again for the fried chicken."}
{"text":"This is the place we take company when they visit the area.  The menu has great choices.  They are famous for the fried chicken-its outstanding.  We are always amazed at how fast the service is and the waitstaff is friendly!  Its charm, wooden floors, stone fireplace and patio dining make this one of our favorite- comfortable places in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"The horny toad in Cavecreek is the best restaurant in town for your pride chicken and or strawberry shortcake everything was delicious the waitress JC is marvelous and the manager Laurie is fantastic we had a wonderful time and great service great food and fun fun fun"}
{"text":"The most amazing food I have had in my entire life!  We sat on the nice patio which is pet friendly by the way and enjoyed the breeze while we ate. Thank you!!! We will be coming back for years to come!!!!!

The waitstaff was quick and friendly anticipating our needs for drinks, dressings, and even extra napkins. 

I even took the time to PERSONALLY THANK the cook for an outstanding job!"}
{"text":"I remember thinking it was so funny that the Satisfied Frog was right down the road basically from the Horny Toad.  I mean, was the Frog totally getting all the action?  The Toad was left so totally unsatisfied? (Yes, I know what a horny toad is. I am a native, remember?  But as a kid these things are hilarious.)

Strangely enough, that's kinda how it looks.  The Satisfied Frog will have tons of people being brought in by the bus load.  The Horny Toad was always fairly easy to get into.  I feel like the Satisfied Frog actually takes some of the heat off of the Horny Toad so that it could be a better place, but sometimes I think it's trying too hard to just be like the Frog.  

Yea, it's kinda touristy, but it's also really close to some other cool spots.  Do the big Cave Creek loop and, if you're not going for high cuisine, stop here first.  Grab some casual - but not super high quality - grub at the Toad, hang out and watch the tourists while you eat.  Then go over to the Town Dump right down the street.  You've just experienced Cave Creek.  You can now finish the loop and end up in Scottsdale for the rest of your tourist shopping.  One more city checked off your guest's list and you didn't have to fight through bus loads of people."}
{"text":"My husband remembered loving this place as a kid, so we went again. Fun looking atmosphere, but that's the best it gets. We had horrible service. It was a Monday night at 8pm. Looked Busy when we got there but most people were finishing up, so we were surprised by how poor the service was here. Food is ok but overpriced. Read on for details...

DRINKS: My husband ordered a margarita w/ No salt. Guess what, it came with salt. (Strike one). And it took 25 minutes for them to come cuz the ran out of triple sec (strike 2). Poor planning on them cuz the prickly pear margaritas were on special! It tasted good though and u would have ordered two except that the were small portions (wine glass portion) for 8 bucks.  Next I ordered a blue moon (one of the few \"good\" beer options) which came in a glass...not pint. Our server didn't even mention the size. At least they got the Orange wedge right.

FOOD: Grandpa ordered fried chicken and loved it. My husband and cousin got fajitas, I got sirloin streak, and other cousin got pork sandwich. The fajitas come on a sizzling plate with an extra plate of sides. Smelled and looked delicious, but by the time the tortillas arrived (we had to ask for them), there was no more sizzle and food was cold (Strike 3). Also they forgot to bring me my steak (STRIKE 4) so after everyone else's food came (except for tortillas) We had to wait about 7 mins for our server to return and ask if we needed anything. Finally, she brought out my steak and tortillas 10 mins after everyone's food arrived. Steak was cold cuz of the wait, but it was cooked perfectly how I liked it. Oh, watch out for the skimpy dinner salad, though. It's a cheap dole salad with only lettuce with barely any carrot and red cabbage shavings. Big disappointment.  

BILL: I was hopeful our server was smart enough to recognize the shitty service we had and offer up free dessert or something, but she wasn't that smart! We were charged full prices for everything. I pulled her aside and mentioned my frustration. Then she took off the tortillas and gave us dessert. This was her saving grace. 

Overall, they get one star for the bill compromise and one star for food taste. But service and prices were pretty bad."}
{"text":"Extremely nice and welcoming staff.  Super affordable prices.  Very good comfort food.  A carnivore's heaven with burgers, steak and even liver!  

We had the Fried Chicken and it was quite good. 

Friend had the liver and onions and she raved about its flavor and crispness. 

The Bourbon Mules were yummmmmmy. 

The piece de resistance ~ Strawberry Shortcake!! Huge.  Heavenly."}
{"text":"For a destination touristy place, surprisingly good food!
Wife and I shared a full fried Chicken, served with fries and cole slaw. I wanted to try the ribs, so ordered a half rack.
French fries were excellent, crispy coating delicious.
Cole slaw fresh and really good.  The chicken was the best we have had in years. Nicely seasoned crunchy skin, yet juicy and perfectly cooked .Big juicy pieces, not some overgrown pigeon!
The ribs were very good, but rather pricy. Needed the BBQ sauce accompanying to flavor them up, but nicely cooked and good quality.
Finished up with the renowned strawberry shortcake. Perfect finish to a very pleasant and satisfying meal.
Good service, good value, good food. This place is the real thing and a deserving winner.
Can't wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was the lick of the draw and I just got a bad batch but I came into this restaurant last night with my boyfriend for a late dinner.

Our server was awesome. Very sweet and was on top of everything. 

I got a side salad and a bowl of chili. In my opinion the chili needed some kick to it. It was slightly bland. The side salad was much larger than I thought so kudos go then! I'm not sure what happened but I ended up not feeling well immediately after eating the chili. I ended up in the bathroom at the end of the night. At the restaurant My boyfriend had a pulled pork sandwich. It seemed to have been heated up in a microwave or something it was much hotter than a normal pulled pork sandwich. 

Food gets a C and service gets a A+"}
{"text":"Tourist trap!  This place is for children and retired people.

This is nothing special in regards to good food.  It's just a touristy... I don't even know.  I think people just want to say that they've dined at the Horny Toad like it's a funny joke or something.  In reality, the only thing funny is the fact that you're going to overpay for your experience there... wait... that's not funny."}
