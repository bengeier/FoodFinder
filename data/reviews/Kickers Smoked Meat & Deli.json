{"text":"Dropped  in at Kickers yesterday for lunch and was very pleased with the service, and quality of food! I was also on a deadline, so needed to be quick, and the food came out fast, hot, and delicious! The service was friendly, and the atmosphere was great. Sat at the window and watched the people passing by on 1st. SW. A damn good Smoked Meat Sandwich, and Soup!"}
{"text":"Smoked meat - walked in mid afternoon. Owner was behind the counter and super friendly, walked me through all the fine details of smoked meat and made great recommendations. He told me all about the history of the building and the wicked chanedlier in the middle of the restaurant and how he painstakingly restored it. Would totally go back!"}
{"text":"Great lunch place with amazing Montreal Style sandwhiches.  Love the Chandelier, will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in town for the Calgary Stampede.  We had never heard of Montreal Smoked Meat sandwiches so we stopped by and met the friendly owner, Tom.  The sandwiches was so good we went back two days later.  We highly recommend Kickers.  Thanks Tom!"}
{"text":"Rolled in around 2 pm on Friday after the lunch hour rush. Tom, the proprietor, was there and greeted me with a friendly intro to the various meats (smoked brisket, turkey, salmon) and made suggestions on food and beer. I settled on a Reuben, which was somewhat unusual (smoked turkey, cranberry, cheese: toasted). It was a solid, tasty sandwich. I wanted to try the beef and Tom obliged bestowing a free sample of some brisket, home-made mustard, and a pickle.  Also had a nice chat with Tom about his travels, the chandelier and history of the building housing the smokehouse, and the recent Calgary floods.  The spot seems to have a good mix of local regulars and tourists (eg from a nearby hotel arts).  Great local lunch spot. Wouldn't hesitate to drop by again."}
{"text":"A taste of Montreal. I am a bit of a smoked meat snob having spent considerable time finding just the right deli in Montreal for an exceptional sandwich and am a fan of La bi√®re St-Ambroise. Imagine how thrilled I am to find both 2 minutes from my office. I tried the traditional Montreal smoked this time but will be back for the smoked turkey, cranberries and brie sandwich soon."}
{"text":"The sandwiches contain a generous amount of smoked meat, which is served on warm bread with a good house mustard.  The flavour and texture of the sandwich was really good, but the coleslaw I had as a side was entirely flavourless.  The sandwiches are the only thing made in site; all of the sides come from a tub.  Although I was pleased with the sandwich, the price is rather high for what you get, and the bland, prepackaged sides are disappointing."}
{"text":"We were killing time in Calgary waiting for our return flight home and my boyfriend was craving a Montreal Smoke Meat sandwhich. He had one in Banff and wanted more. Found this place on Yelp and it was very close to downtown so we walked over.  Tom is just awesome. Very friendly, loves blues, knows his stuff, and makes a mean sandwhich. We both left with happy bellies back to California!"}
{"text":"I was originally brought to Kickers via a co-worker.  What a great little find.  This is a small place.  It's really what you would think of is someone called it a \"Nook\".  Although it does have huge windows which let in a ton of natural light, so it's not a dungeon or dark.  There is seating for approx 20-25, although I've never stayed (only take-out).  The Order counter is at the back and along the way they done a great job of getting some really wonderful local art work to display.    The menu is simple and mainly limited to Smoked Meat Sandwiches or other deli type sandwiches (ie: Reuben).  They have fries and other sides, but again its fairly limited selection.    Don't let the limited selection deter you.  This place serves up an awesome smoked meat sandwich.  Definitely try the house mustard as well, the paring is great !  If you are feeling hungry order the fries as well.  The fries are baked and not deep fried.  They come out hot and crispy.  Definitely one of the better french fries you can have.  Even doing take-out and walking 2 blocks back to the office, the fries were still hot and crispy.    The staff were very friendly and explained things very well.  I'll definitely be back to have another one of those awesome smoked meat sandwiches."}
{"text":"Fantastic smoked meat sandwich - friendly staff - cool chandelier. Perfect spot for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I rarely give out 5 star reviews so you know Kickers had an amazing effect on me. I've only been once but it's because I don't feel I deserve something so amazing so often. The smoked meat was EASILY the best I've ever had (comparable to the best of Montreal I've been told). The potato salad was awesome as were the healthy fries (the owner actually took the time to explain how healthy the cooking process was). And speaking of the owner, I have never felt so welcomed and appreciated to be in a restaurant regardless the size. I don't care where you are in the city, if you want a truly great experience it is worth the trip into the core. 18/30"}
{"text":"Pros: -Cool little shop with personal service -Prices include side and GST -Nice location, hosts live music occasionally -Toased sandwiches very yummy...especially the one with brie!  Cons: -Wasn't impressed by the Rideau Canal sandwich. I paid $10 for a dry sandwich I could have easily made at home. :( -Side of \"potato\" was actually a small serving of potato salad, which I hate. I wish that was communicated more clearly.    I would go back now that I know what to expect. Seems like the staff are pretty cool and it wasn't packed at lunch time."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this deli from others, and so I tried it out.  Cool little location, and the first place that I've seen that openly advertises that he uses Lester's meat (there's about 4 to 5 main providers of smoked meat in bulk, Lester's is a pretty famous one in Montreal during the ol' Montreal Expos' years with wicked hot dogs).  Another ex-Quebecois who knows what he's doing, the smoked meat was outstanding, though and probably the best representation of smoked meat from a resto inside of Calgary.  If you can't do the 45 minute drive to Canmore, Kickers is definately the next place you should go to!"}
