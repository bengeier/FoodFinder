{"text":"The best sausages, kielbasa, weiners and basically any smoked meats in Toronto!!! I live across the road and this is my go to place for Polish goodies. The owner is very friendly and makes some damn good sausages."}
{"text":"I have bought various products from this store many times. My absolute favourite are the smoked sausages. When grilled in the oven or just eaten as they come, they are absolutely delicious. I have tried other sausages from other delis around the Roncy as well as in Toronto; by far these are the best sausages. The taste of the smoked sausages is so yummy, so mouth watering, I keep going back for more. The owner and his staff are ever so polite and always welcome you with a warm smile. I highly recommend this place. Hope this place stays forever. Thanks to everyone who has recommended this place. We need more of this type of delis selling such quality of meat."}
{"text":"Ok, this is the place for real Kielbasa a hidden gem.   3 different varieties  Made in store !! Family business.  Amazing  Ham , Bacon, sausage, pork tenderloin  . Great staff. And very fairly priced.  My family had been coming for ten years."}
{"text":"You hadn't had a great Polish sausauge if you hadn't tried the ones offered at Village Meat's   Tried one from a visit from the Polish festival this year. They were BBQing out front. They were amazing!  Mild and flavourful, and the taste destroys anything from those street meat vendors peddling their inferior meat warez around the city."}
{"text":"I agree with the above. I've purchased things from this store on several occasions (bacon, pork tenderloin, sausages, condiments, sweets)... we got some of the sausages on the weekend and put them on the BBQ... holy shit... I don't know what they do to them.  Everyone kept going on about how delicious they were-- they stay nice and moist inside and the skin just gets nicely crispy. Amazing bacon too and the pork tenderloin was lovely. I hope they stay open forever."}
{"text":"I come in for the smoked sausages. Super delicious! The staff are very friendly too! They have a good selection of other Polish foods as well."}
{"text":"Sometimes a nice fresh cut of deli meat and cheese on freshly baked bread is simply wonderful.  $4 for a sandwich with butter and mustard---the Europeans sure know how to make a simple Sandwich!"}
