{"text":"Our waiter was friendly, but very scatter brained. I had to flag him down for a soda refill. He forgot the side of sour cream my friend ordered. We had to ask THREE times for the bill. We were there for lunch so it was frustrating when we needed to get out of there and we couldn't get the bill.  As for the food....the salsa was bland, bland, bland. No spice, no heat. The chips were good though. Not too greasy.   My lunch combo came with a taco. I couldn't eat it. Hard to explain, but the ground beef tasted off. The rice was good though. The refried beans were AWFUL. They were almost runny and did not look the right color at all.   The decor is nice. It seemed really clean, too.   I really don't think I'll be back. Maybe I'd have a margarita there. The reviews have mentioned that they are pretty good. It could be that the waiter was having an off day. He was friendly but the lack of flavor in the food was a real disappointment."}
{"text":"According to a bunch of other reviews, this is a love-it-or-hate-it sort of place, although I'm not really sure why. The food seemed quite on-par with Mi Pueblo's and my enchiladas were tasty. There was plenty of food for me to take home, too.  I thought the decor and the bathrooms were just awesome. Excellent ambiance.  The waitress, Josephin, was adorable and super-helpful and attentive.   Pictures, as always, on the blog: http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/07/la-fiesta-restaurant.html"}
{"text":"don't go here. why would you? it makes your body feel like it's been hit by a dumptruck, la fiesta will make you run to la bathroom. don't. don't. don't. (especially combo #8)"}
{"text":"Apparently reservations don't matter here and priority is given if the host knows you. Poor service for Yankee Doodle Mexican food. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Only Mexican restaurant that I've ordered take out from that doesn't give you chips and salsa."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but the entrees were kind of bland.  The flavor was there but it seemed like they went light on seasoning and spice in the dishes we tried.  The salsa and chips were fresh and delicious and the side salads, rice, and beans that came with the food were good too.    Vibe was pretty casual and most people were having margaritas.  The major college football games were on TV.  Servers were friendly.  Food did take a while but having chips and salsa definitely made the wait more bearable."}
{"text":"my family and I went to to the waterloo art walk. We got hungry so my mom looked on yelp for a restaurant that was near us and we went to la Fiesta. I ordered the kids nachos and it was disgusting. I got cheese,beans,ground beef,and sour cream on my nachos. something was watery in it so the chips on the bottom were soggy. my waiter was very nice. And I have no idea why there was valet parking because there was not that many parking spots."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly but food mediocre.  I had the fish tacos.......maybe one step up from Taco Bell?  Restaurant was clean.  Sangria, dubious."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this place with our two kids, ages 3 and 5.  The margaritas are tasty, but not the best I have ever had.  The decor is just OK, but what the place really needs is new flooring.  I thought it was kind of gross as the carpeting was literally worn down in spots.  There was outside seating which looked nice enough but it was too cold to eat outside the day we were there.    The food was good tasting, but I have had more authentic food elsewhere. There was a spicy salsa that came with our chips that we thought was quite good.  The overall experience was OK and  I probably will go back as it is near our house and the margaritas hit the spot.  I just wish they would get new flooring and also give some attention/remodeling to the restrooms-- I visited them 4 times while there with the kiddos so I got to examine them closely."}
{"text":"More expensive than I could have imagined. $40 for two people to eat (and we didn't order anything big or special). The food was bland and mediocre at best. Service was just okay. For the price of the food you could go to a really nice Mexican restaurant and not this place. Hope this review saves someone the trip, I wish I would've known!"}
{"text":"I think that like most Mexican restaurants, some of the dishes are so-so, but others are amazing.  My favorite, which isn't exactly on the menu, is the carnitas tacos.  By recommendation of the host, you should order the carnitas extra crispy.  They have great salsa, and their side of guacamole is really great, and the amount you get for the price can't be beat.  I find the staff to be friendly, but not overbearing like other reviewers have said.  All in all, I hope that this restaurant succeeds.  The people have a good heart and the food is good too."}
{"text":"Gone for dinner on Saturday night. Place was busy, we opted to sit outside in the sun light. We were given a table and 5 min later we were asked to move as the table was meant for bigger groups. Didn't have issue with the request and we obliged.  Server was attentive and knowledgeable about the food. When I asked for my dish to make it spicy, she forgot to mention that the bell peppers had additional charge(minor $0.75). I presume its basic to get customer approval before putting any additional charges.  Food portion size was decent, the food taste regular mexican joint. Didn't standout. I was hoping to taste something different / nice after reading their 50 year history on the menu.  Overall - Nice ambiance, decent service and little pricy"}
{"text":"If you're on the east side and craving non-chain Mexican food (are there any around now that Don Pablo's is gone?), then try La Fiesta. Never been to Mexico, so can't speak to the authenticity of the food, but compared to chain restaurants it's pretty darn good.  Service was noticeably quicker today, but we also commented on what we believed was new staff, so maybe that was the reason. This place has been around for over 50 years, though, and we usually see who we assume is the owner. Quality and taste of food is consistent and they're surprisingly quick to get the entrees out to your table. Between the complimentary chips/salsa and entrees, which include a salad or soup - had the gazpacho today (yum!) - you won't leave hungry!  I've been getting the same thing the past few times - burritos (one, chicken with salsa verde and the other, shredded beef). Splurged and got cheese on both (which I believe was a whopping $1/per item!), but it made a big difference, in a good way! My husband usually gets the chorizo burrito, which has chorizo and eggs. Today, he switched it up and got enchiladas (chorizo, chicken with salsa verde and just plain chicken). Their beans are fantastic, so I usually pass on the rice and double up on the beans. I recommended shying away from a dinner special they call \"seafood burrito\". Got it the first time we went there and the burrito filling was pretty mushy and had a fishy taste. I remember just loading up on chips/salsa that night.      :)  The bar, complete with thatched roof, is usually busy and they have a festive private room with gated entrance for events or large groups (probably seats 15-20). Get a strawberry margarita (or two!) - they're quite tasty (and strong!).  Would give them 4 stars, but they're not open on Sundays - boo! I give them a solid 3.5."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant if you want inexpensive American-Mexican food in a clean, casual environment with top-notch customer service. My boyfriend and I eat out A LOT, and we like La Fiesta for quite a few reasons.  First, and this is a biggie because we're both grad students, its reasonably priced. The more expensive items on the menu will run you around $15-16, but the majority of the full entrees (including: chips/salsa starter, meat, veggies, tortillas [when appropriate], and usually some combination of rice and beans) will be about $12.  Second, they have AWESOME customer service. The employees are very friendly, and are quick to fill water, chips bowl, and your orders. You are greeted with an \"Hola, amigos!\" and sent off with a smile; they have one waiter in particular who is really friendly and does a great job.   Food comes out in less than five minutes most of the time. Usually when this happens, I'm skeptical of the quality, but Fiesta does a decent job being consistently good (not wonderful, but good...see below).   The only downside is that the food isn't the \"best\" Mexican food in town. For that, you might want to go to Huraches Moroleon down the street, or Maize on campus. However, their food is yummy, relatively healthy (they don't douse in oil), and tastes fresh. The shrimp fajitas are great, and my boyfriend always gets the \"quesadilla supreme,\" and is always happy with the choice.   Overall, if you're in southeast urbana and hungry, this is a solid, reliable choice."}
{"text":"Spouse says it was a lot of money and not that great. But it was ok. Take it from there.... We were pleased to see Posole on the menu, since we both lived in New Mexico and that is a special dish. It had lots of pork, but less of the hominy. Good chili base. Needed salt.  I had fish tacos. Hot, fresh. Lots of cabbage. But no salsa. I added from the table salsa bowl. Spouse had chili rellenos. Good tasting with lots of cheese. But not much chili or chili flavor.  So.... Good stuff for Ohio. But if you want the real thing, I say go to New Mexico."}
{"text":"For all the love that Maize, Mas Amigos, and El Toro get (and I love all three), La Fiesta is the best mexican restaurant in the C-U.  We've stopped going to the others because we love this place so much.  It has the BEST prices, outstanding service, and food that is just as good as the others.  It's just not as trendy because it's in a defunct strip mall.  I'm a fan of their Burrito Loco with the cheese sauce.  Lastly, coupons are fairly easy to find online, which makes it even a better deal."}
{"text":"We stopped here while on vacation and ended up regretting it. They are not ready for large groups. The  service was slow and the food was cold by the time it was brought out. In addition the food is not authentic. The pozole is the worst we've ever had. Our drinks were wrong and we had to ask for limes 3 times. The waitress was rude when we pointed out our order was wrong. For the price I'd say we were robbed. One star for them because of the chocolate milk for kids."}
{"text":"Just ok. Food was luke warm, not hot,  service was slow. My margarita was warm as well!"}
{"text":"The good - Great drinks, great server.  The bad - complimentary chips looked half eaten from another table.  The food looked amazing and tasted pretty good after I took it home and heated it. It was like a high grade TV dinner.  When my food arived at the table it was clear that they forgot to microwave it before serving it to me.  I placed the back of my fingers on several spots of the entire dish only to find that out was cool to room temperature. A total disappointment.  Non traditional and over priced for fancy microwave dinners. At least taco bell heats their food before giving it to you."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here on a Wednesday night and we had a blast!!! Shrimp quesadilla suggested by our awesome server Liz R was outstanding! But the most important part, the margaritas were amazing and we are very picky. No overly sweet margaritas here! Caroline and April were sweet as pie as our hostesses and accommodated us very well. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I do not recommend this restaurant.  They were enthusiastic when we walked in, the service was fair, and the place is cute and decorated.  But the food was bad.  We started with guacamole- it was the grossest I have ever had, completely overpowered with onions, yet still tasted bland.  It didn't even taste like there were avocados in there.  And it didn't get any better.  Our entrees were bland (just excess salt), the refried beans were a creepy grey color, the sopapillas were bland.  It just was not a good dinner."}
{"text":"I had really looked forward to trying this place after a friend said it was \"THE BEST MEXICAN IN CLEVELAND\"...The first time I tried it, it was mediocre at best and the service was horrendous and the prices are high for the portion sizes.  I had to ask at least four times for a glass of water to take a pill that I had been holding since being seated.  So, I chalked it up as a bad experience and wanted to try again. The second time was no better. Actually, the service was still very poor and the food was nothing even remotely special. I was super disappointed because I LOVEEEEEEEE la taqueria (next door, ran by the son I believe). Over all, I will not being going back. There is far better mexican food around."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been coming here since I was a kid and they were across the street. Family owned and operated. Brian has done a great job keeping up with the times while remaining true to their roots.  He's even expanded and added La Taqueria next door and a banquet type hall for parties next to that. The best chips and salsa ever, and the salsa is homemade every day.  Uncle Jimmys golden margarita is a perennial award winner and for good reason. I also love the Mexican nachos and you can never go wrong with anything from the combo menu.  My personal favorite is the chicken enchilada with the hard shell shredded beef taco.  Be sure to finish with some ice cream topped with caramel sauce in a fried shell with cinnamon and sugar!    We drive 45 minutes each way just to get our La Fiesta fix. So for us, it's not even a contest. La Fiesta is the absolute best!!"}
{"text":"Decent not great.  Other Mex places are way better   Chicken fajitas were bland.  Service was good."}
{"text":"La Fiesta is awesome!!  A authentic, family-run Mexican restaurant, 3 generations can be there on any given night.  The ingredients are fresh and high quality (West Side Market for many), the food consistently excellent, and the margaritas.....ask the bartender (Jim) for a gold. You will not be disappointed. I always get the simple fare: (chorizo or steak) quesadillas (Chihuahua cheese), chili rellenos (heat will vary with the season), tamales (hand crafted on the premises - a 3 day process), etc. This is not like other Mexican restaurants. If you want typical generic Americanized fare, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Positives, the place looks really good on the inside.  They have a nice little outdoor seating area.  The service is good and friendly.  The drink prices are better than reasonable.  They provide chips and salsa.  All though I am not sure why this is a big deal in Ohio.  Anyway, it is there.  So, to the food.  As has been pointed out, this is some seriously bland stuff.  I am not sure why they are afraid to let any spices near.  We had chicken fajitas.  Most flavorful part were the onions.  Seriously, and take my word for it.  We also had some Caso Flomiata.  Not sure of the spelling.  It is a cheese dish.  This was the smallest little sampling I have ever seen.  Not even close to worth the $6.00.  Also has one cheese enchilada.  The presentation was good, but they microwaved it.  The cheese on the inside was microwaved burnt.  Hard and crispy.  This is about $3.00.     They also do in house salsas, which they charge for.  Did not partake.  All in all if you are there for the drinks, good choice.  If you want to eat something, at this point I would say move on."}
{"text":"Excellent family owned restaurant serving great authentic Mexican food. The food always tastes fresh, never have to wait long for food, and the atmosphere is great. Great service, great food, and great restaurant. Highly recommend coming here, has a great selection of choices to choose from and never lets me down."}
{"text":"Great food, which seems authentic, although we don't really know this to be fact. Golden margarita is on point.   Nice, no frills place. One of our favs on the east side."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Have been coming here for 35 years (I.e., since I was a baby).  Authentic cuisine.  Family run."}
{"text":"I've tried to like La Fiesta, I really have.  I have friends who visit regularly and always rave about it.  I just don't see it.    Visited on a Friday for lunch.  I had the flank steak chimichanga and my friend had the pick four combo plate.  He choose a hard taco, soft taco, enchilada and a burrito.  Both meals came with rice and beans.  My meal was okay.  Not great, not bad but just okay.  My friend's meal was about the same.  Of the four items, he liked the hard taco the best but we both agreed that the food was fairly flavorless, especially for an authentic Mexican restaurant.  While the server was very nice, he was overwhelmed.  There were about 12 tables seated for lunch and a couple of people at the bar and he was the only server for the entire restaurant!  He certainly tried his best but he was very rushed when he stopped by our table.  Our bill was $24 for the two of us which I think is a little high for the quality of the food.  I think I'll give La Fiesta another try since I've heard good things about the restaurant. Maybe if I ordered a margarita next time the food will taste better.  It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"This is the ultimate worst place I have ever been too.  Server had an attitude and wouldn't even look us in the eye.    The restaurant is out of tequila, shrimp, pork.   How do you even run a restaurant like this? You would think prior to ordering the server would know any of this? Needless to say, we got up and left. Mediocrity at its best."}
{"text":"The one star was for the decent Margarita. I got the first one made, and it was the top of an the unmixed piticher, and the rest continued to get weaker as the went down the table.   As for food, this was the worst meal I have ever eaten at ANY restaurant. 12 people from my work meet here for dinner last night. I was initially impressed by what I saw on the menu. I tried the Carne con Chili, which came with a salad or soup. They had Posole  which I typically love. It was a dark red broth, with almost no hominy and very little meat. I ate 3 bites hoping it would get better. The last bite I tried tasted like some foreign type of meat covered in crap. It was not just the worst Posole I have ever eaten, but the WORST ANYTHING I have ever eaten ANYPLACE!   The Carne con chili I had was what they called \"Mexican Hot\". It had the same strange taste to the red sauce, and was not much better. It was again a dark red soupy sauce, that tasted like it had half a bottle of Worcestershire, and with about a cup of small bites of pork. 2 of the 3 biggest pieces were nothing but fat.   There were only 3 out of 12 people said they like the food, and 2 said average. All the people who liked it were from NE. I travel the SW doing service, and am an AZ native. I grew up on Mexican food, and am now a Chilihead. Good Chili Verde is one of my favorite things in life. It's getting harder to find."}
{"text":"I got takeout the other day, expecting more food for over $50 order. Food tasted fine, but nothing special compared to other Mexican restaurants. It is the attention to detail that will get me to come back, and they were lacking in that. Large guacamole was tiny, they did not include the salads, and I also asked for more chips since all that was included was a small bag, and I was denied. Management should empower wait staff / hostess to be more customer focused."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant and I came with high expectations because several people recommended it to me. The place was packed when we arrived and had to wait 15 minutes to get seated which made me think the food must be great! After getting seated the salsa and chips came right away and I wish I could say the same thing about our server. After bringing our drinks I asked for a few more minutes to decide. Needless to say when we where ready to order I couldn't locate him anywhere. We waited for about 10-15 minutes for him to come back and finally asked another server if they could get him. After taking our order he once again disappeared. We couldn't get refills on our drinks or more salsa until our dinners came out which also took a long time. I ordered a combo platter with a shredded pork burrito and chorizo enchilada and my son got the chipotle shrimp. My food arrived cold but I ate it because I fear I would have to wait too long if I mention this. Besides being cold the food was very bland and flavorless. My son's shrimp also barely had flavor. The salsa was spicy but also bland. When our server finally came to check on us I did mention to him that my food was cold. He offered to replace the burrito on my platter but I did not want to wait to get a replacement. He also offered an apology and said that they were packed and that's why it happened. Unfortunately no compensation on my meal ticket came with that apology. In my opinion restaurants should be prepared to handle big crowds and the service and taste of the food should not be compromised. I can say that I will not be eating here again nor will I be recommending this place to anyone I know. Sucks because I have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant on the side of town and I thought this one was it!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was overpriced and fairly bland. The chips tasted like they were out of a bag. The guac was ok, but little more than some smashed avocado. And the chimichanga was fairly bland, even with the spicy mayo. All of these things would have been permissible if it wasn't so incredibly expensive!! Otherwise, the service and atmosphere were nice. And they have a huge selection of Mexican beers. But, I will probably not go back. And, if I did, I would definitely not get the chimichanga. You can get much better for your money."}
{"text":"EWWWW EWWW EWWW is that american cheese in my enchilada.   Now maybe after years of living in Lorain and eating at many Mexican friends' homes I am spoiled when it comes to Mexican food. And maybe after living in Ohio City and having access to Momocho I am very spoiled when it comes to Mexican cuisine but Mexican or not this place was DISGUSTING!  The boy and I ventured into La Fiesta after a movie at Richmond as there were not too many places to choose from especially if like me you don't eat at chain restaurants. It was included in the Cleveland ethnic eats book. .. just a note throw that book away the author wouldn't know good food if it bit her in the. . .anyways. We enter the restaurant and the first thing I notice is . . . no one is Mexican never a good sign.    We get seated by a very perky waitress and as of decor and ambience this place kinda felt like applebees. All I really noticed were alcohol signs. The margaritas weren't bad but were rather pricy ($7 really?). The service was fast and attentive  and perky. . . too perky.  Now onto the food: I ordered- Gazpacho 2 cheese and onion enchiladas  1 chicken with verde sauce enchilada rice and beans  The boy ordered: Azteca soup chicken with mole burrito chicken with green sauce burrito  *both with cheese rice and beans  First came soup. My soup tasted something like cocktail sauce with vegetables. There was no season no spice no heat. The vegetables were crispy but that was the only plus. .  not to mention half of them did not belong in Gazpacho. The boy's soup was saturated with cheese (and avacado but that could be picked out). And while everyone loves cheese. .. there comes a cheese limit. It was inedible.  Then comes the meals. Now the portions were large I will give them that but if I wanted a large portion of crappy Mexican food Chi Chi's is cheaper. The enchiladas which were said to be stuffed with queso blanco. . . were stuffed with white american cheese. .. YUCK! The chicken enchilada was chicken wrapped in a flour tortilla and cooked til the chicken had the texture of cardboard. The boy's chicken was about the same and his burritos were essentially enchiladas just bigger. And his entire plate was covered in that disgusting excuse for queso blanco.  The rice was your standard spanish rice from a box with vegetables from the freezer. . . I think Uncle Ben's 90 second Mexican rice would taste better. And the beans tasted like off brand canned refried beans.   YUCK !   The food could be summed up as chain restaurant food with a non chain price and name.   Not to miss: Star Trek it was the highlight of the evening.  Hit or miss: Margaritas were good but overpriced  Avoid like the plague.  This sad excuse of a restaurant. Go to Mi Pueblo instead!"}
{"text":"I had to write a review, because some of these reviews are not appropriate for this amazing place. If you are looking for drive thru, go to Taco Bell. If you want to relax, have an uncle Jimmy gold margarita, enjoy an app, tackle the chilliaques, football sized burrito, Mexican Carmel sundae, then this is your place. Love the servers, go a couple times and you will feel like you are family. Excellent food, pleasant service, exceptional drinks."}
{"text":"Hmm. The best thing about this place are the drinks. The food just wasn't flavorful to me. Whenever I go to Mexican or Mexican-inspired restaurant and nothing stands out on the menu, I'll usually just go for the steak fajita. It was okay, steak wasn't tender enough. It just didn't do it for me but it's probably a good place for happy hour."}
{"text":"Awesome Authentic Mexican food. You will be very lucky to have Brian as your server. I definitely reccomend the nacho appetizer. The taco salad with chicken is awesome. The house dressing is amazing. I wish they bottled it and offered it for sale. They now have an outdoor patio which is a lot of fun. The golden margarita pitcher is $50 but it is worth every penny. Almost everything on the menu is delicious! You will not regret visiting this place!"}
{"text":"Leaving a bad review may not be one of my favorite things to do, but sometimes necessary. First thing, please remove pot of dirt in entry, it smells horrific and made me want to exit immediately, unfortunately, lunch breaks need to be brief and didn't have time to go elsewhere. Second, the place was empty....strike 2. 3rd issue.....too expensive for poor food prep, presentation, taste standpoint.  I ordered Carmina's, not on lunch menu....11.99, co worker, chicken fajitas, think 10.99. Carnitas came out and the meat was red. Looked like corned beef. Waitress sent manager who said they were cooked 8 hours and lots of paprika used to season. They sure we're tender, but such odd look and texture, I sent them back. Shared Co workers fajitas which were sub pat but edible.  Not good in any way, shape, or form....this place needs serious help. Actually feeling very I'll, hoping I didn't get poisoned!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Tucson, I didn't have the highest expectations but ended up being very pleasantly surprised. The waiter we had was excellent with his suggestions, and was very pleasant. I tried the Huevos Rancheros and found them to be flavorful and excellent. My dining companions had various dishes including tostadas and burritos. Everyone was satisfied. We finished by splitting a flan, which was devoured.  Even coming from the plethora of choices offered in Tucson, if this restaurant were located there, I would eat there again. We'll be back the next time we visit."}
{"text":"I would not come here again. The waiter completely forgot about us and the food was below mediocre. I got a beef burrito and it was basically all refried beans and hardly any meat. The pork was hard, tasteless and unappetizing. I suggest Dos reales for better food, service and prices!"}
{"text":"Place is just ok. Service was a little slow/forgetful. Food came out so fast they hadn't heated my boyfriend's meal all the way. Chicken was cooked but the burrito itself was cold.  My fish tacos were hot out of the fryer, had a good flavor but mostly batter. Beans and rice were kind of bland to sum them up. Queso was decent but tasted a little like processed cheese (think velveeta).   I would say the salsa was the best thing we had. A bit overpriced."}
{"text":"First time coming to this restaurant! Waitress was pleasant. I Order the chimichanga meal with rice and beans, The beans were fine. When it came to me eating my steak chimichanga, The meet, was horrible, tasted old and refrigerated. Taste like it was From the night before, ended up hurting my stomach, I asked them if they can give me something else! so I ended up getting the bean and cheese burrito. I will not end up coming here again, I wasted my money!"}
{"text":"20 years ago we were frequent diners at LaFiesta until three family members received food poisoning from the chicken which had tasted fine at the time.  We narrowed the illness down to food poison since all 3 who got sick had the chicken and the other 4 who did not get sick did not have the chicken.     Letting bygones be bygones we decided to try LaFiesta again last night and found that while the chips and salsa were tastier than we remembered, the rest of the food was quite lousy.  No one from our party of 5 got food poisoning but, 3 of the 5 members were in the bathroom most of the night with upset stomachs.  It must have been that our stomachs were not prepared for the \"authentic\" cuisine of LaFiesta, including the MonteSumas revenge...  I will say that bar none, LaFiesta has the best Chili Rellenos around.  I wish I could be more positive, but the other foods including the pork tacos and steak Chimichangas just weren't very good."}
{"text":"I love La Fiesta.  I think the food is delicious.  The prices are VERY reasonable. And the waitstaff is friendly and efficient.  We love that kids eat free on Sundays and they don't make it a secret....they actually tell you this when you order!"}
{"text":"They served undercooked fish. That happens, but i grade on what happens next.  The waitress took the plate back to the kitchen.   I would expect that a new piece of fish would be fired. Nope - same fish.  I would expect the restaurant to apologize (manager level or higher) . Nope - only the waitress visited the table even though the owner and owner's son were working.  I would expect a response of a discounted bill. Yes - five dollars off of a $23 dish.   1 out of 3 expected responses don't cut it. The cheapest response (the apology) wasn't given.   When i told the owner's son i was disappointed (after paying), his response was mumbled and not an apology.  Other than the waitress who got no support, the only real response i was told was \"I didnt cook it\". That's a fail. 1 star and i wont go back. I have eaten here at least 6 times previously. Every other visit was fine."}
{"text":"Pretty slow service. When coming here give yourself plenty of time. It took us almost two hours from sitting down to leaving.   I have dietary restrictions; after speaking to the waiter and asking multiple times about different options on the menu, I was reassured they were safe for me to eat. By the time we got our check I was already having symptoms that way food contained my allergens.   Pretty disappointed that the staff was unsure of their own food, and worse reassured me it was O.K. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Horrible wait staff.  They didn't have enough menus for a 10 top with the restaurant half filled at lunch on cinco de mayo.   Its not like it doesn't come up every year.  Side not.  You should have a menu for every table and every seat in your restaurant.  Have a host/hostess ready to seat people at lunch and dinner.   We will not be back. I wouldn't recommended you go."}
{"text":"My wife and I love to go to La Fiesta and the catch a movie at Richmond Mall... not because movies at Richmond mall are great, but because it's convenient for us.  Our move is to get a pitcher of the gold margaritas, have some chips and salsa, maybe a little hot food, and then sober up during the movie.  The gold margaritas are quite good.  Very strong.  They should be, as a pitcher is $50.  But, we've done the math, and really... to get completely loaded on delicious margaritas is not a cheap proposition.  No complaints on the price.  When the chips are fresh, which they usually are, they are very good.  Properly salted and everything.  Their salsa is adequate to slightly above average, as far as cheap Americanized Mexican restaurants go.  They have a tasty chorizo dip, which we usually get.  I wouldn't go much further down the menu... we occasionally do dinner there, and I'm always unimpressed.  Their primary seasoning seems to be salt - mounds of it.  I like salt more than any healthy person should, and it tends to be too salty for me.  Very little spice in anything... I could use some more heat or some more cumin in most dishes.  For some casual Americanized Mexican food, it's decent.  The food doesn't suck completely, and the margaritas get the job done and taste good in process."}
{"text":"Went here for a first date, and was apprehensive because for this to be a Mexican restaurant there were no Mexicans. Lol, but the food was great, a good amount of traditional flavor with contemporary flair for this Texas girl. My date had the shrimp quesadilla and I had combo platter with chicken burrito w/ mole, tamale, and chicken enchilada. Don't expect authentic Mexican dishes like flan but definitely very good food. Only complaint is the staff would not leave us alone, after all it was a date."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican food. Family owned- the staff is great. I drive all the way from the west side just to get my fix! Highly recommend!   Favorites: strawberry margarita, the nachos Mexicana, and the tacos al pastor! So yummy!!"}
{"text":"I feel a moral obligation to compensate for not so hot reviews. My food wasn't bland, my service didn't suck and I certainly don't regret going here. The menu sprawls out very prodigiously and so I doubt there's anything Mexican you could possibly want that's not here (maybe lengua or menudo but I sure don't want that). I went a little more \"traditional\"/entry level with las enchiladas supremas and I feel like they were easily comparable to the enchiladas I've had in little, hole in the wall taquerias near where I grew up on Chicago's south side. I'd imagine the same is true for the other dishes.   Also, today was $1.99 margarita day and they sure as shit didn't skimp on the booze. If I think of a two dollar margarita, I imagine a perfunctory splash of tequila and a lot of sweet sugary juice. Nope.   And finally, I could tell this place was the real deal by the tortilla chips. The best Mexican restaurants, as my dad tells me every time anyone brings up Mexican food are the ones that have tortilla chips that are basically cut up, fried tortillas. While Chipotle may be the exception to that rule (although I do like Chipotle), those chips were the sign of authentic Mexican food.  Anyway, above average service and really tasty food for someone who (not to brag) actually knows about real Mexican food. So remember, y'all, as Jemaine from Flight of the Conchords says, \"Be more constructive with your feedback, please.\""}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Mexican food this is the place. My Spanish teacher took is here when they were in the Hilltop Plaza. Now across the street the family continues the tradition and continues to serve great food."}
{"text":"Went to dinner last nigh around 6pm.Seated right away.Service was slow(waited a very long time for two entrees).Food was luke warm & A hot pepper was placed (not ordered) in one of the burritos.Not impressed,& will prob not go back..."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good, menu offers an ample variety of choices.  Servers are friendly and efficient.  The food appears to be made from scratch, is well-flavored and is certainly not in the same league as Taco Bell as other reviewers have suggested.  Salad I had was fresh, no preservatives on the lettuce and the house dressing is delicious.  There are few Mexican restaurants in Cleveland's eastern suburbs; this is certainly a cut above."}
{"text":"So far this is the best Mexican restaurant I've tried in Cleveland Decent enchiladas and tamales I prefer the red sauce over the salsa verde enchiladas The pozole is quite good too- hearty with big chunks of tender pork Good service, and you get a lot of food for your money"}
{"text":"The best Mexican I have found in Cleveland, and I have been to great, authentic places in Arizona and Colorado.    We have been long time patrons of La Fiesta and enjoy this family run restaurant.  Last night was a great night for gazpacho and La Fiesta is on par with the best homemade soup I have had.  Refried beans are made from scratch and very tasty.    The Chili Rellenos are very good.  The service is always good."}
{"text":"Wow, this place really redeemed itself in my eyes!   The kidlet and I met the spouse for a lunch.  Because of my past experiences here, I wasn't expecting much.  I aimed low.   However, I had nothing to fear!  La Fiesta has their act together now.   We ordered from the ample lunch menu: fried beans, rice, kid's quesadilla, chicken tostada, chicken flautas, and chorizo enchilada. We also ordered beer, blended mango margarita, and kid sprite.   First, out server was nice; and she was efficient.  The restaurant was clean, not overly noisy, and comfortable.  The drinks were good.  The food was very fresh!  It was presented neatly and attractively.  The food was prepared and delivered quickly.   I don't know what happened, but this food is now on par with the old Luchita's in Shaker Square back in the day.   Complimentary salsa and hand cut tortilla chips were excellent.   The menu is diverse and includes molé and other choice entrées.  If you haven't been here in a while, it's worth the trip back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a happy hour drink and a snack out on the patio.  I was pleasantly surprised by the ambiance, flavor of food, and how La Fiesta manages to drown out the outside influence of traffic and eyesores.  I am rating it 4 stars mainly because there are NOT that many places with nice patios in the area.  Unlike Corwin, I enjoyed the salsa but thought the chips were a little crispy, not freshly fried or even seasoned.  Salsa is like wing sauce, bbq sauce, corned beef, etc., everyone has their preference and personal taste.  La Fiesta is thin, not chunky, but refreshing and not filling.  We also got the bean burrito and some guacamole, both were very good.  We might just make this our Friday spot before picking up the kid at daycare.  Quiet, quaint, and won us over given the other places in the area.    Apparently its the oldest Mexican Restaurant in the Cleveland area and I think the decor proves it."}
{"text":"Service sucks, food bland, too many waiters around asking if you needed anything. Sometimes too much of a good thing, isn't good."}
{"text":"!Hola meego! That's the enthusiastically friendly greeting everybody gets at this fun little Mexican restaurant. The decor matches the enthusiasm of the staff well: bright colors (even for a Mexican restaurant) are everywhere and everything intangible about this place is bouncing off the walls cheery. I guess its not a coincidence its called \"The Party\".  They have a pretty extensive menu of all the expected classic dishes, plus many that you might not expect. I ordered the \"Ceviche Mexicano\" with chopped (cooked) Tilapia and shrimp in a very lively light lime sauce over tostadas with lettuce, tomatoes, avocados, onions and other good stuff like beans, rice cheese, etc. I liked it a lot. The lady had very good Burritos Suizos, which were far too big to finish. Prices were $10 or less per entree. Good fried tortilla chips with salsa were gratis.  The highlight of the meal were the (Friday night special) 27 ounce Margaritas for $5.95 each. Dont bother with the math. This is by far the best Margarita deal I have ever come across in this town or any other en los Estados Unidos. No, I didn't drive home.  I can't review this place without one more mention of the fact that everybody working here is just so damn nice. As our meal was winding down, no fewer than 5 staff members asked us how everything was. Any server/busser coming within 3 tables of us checked our table to see if we needed anything, every single time.  La Fiesta is not fine dining. However, it is a superlative casual dining Mexican restaurant and delivers incredible value and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night. Enjoyed everything. We both had combination plates. A lot of food for  $14 soup or salad, rice, refried beans and two tacos  or burritos or enchiladas or you get the idea. Food  is authentic and good."}
{"text":"Al Pastor is slow-cooked pork on a spit, akin to gyro meat or shawarma. At least in Mexico City it is...This was a quarter-inch thick grilled pork chop with little seasoning. It even still had the hard fat on it! It was mixed with canned pineapple that I do not believe was even heated served with bland beans and even blander Spanish rice. Wife had bland chicken fajitas that were served with above bland rice and beans. Kid also had the requisite quesadilla, and bland beans, rice. Salad on side was nice addition. It was a bland iceberg cut up with one quarter of a tomato and had an Italianny dressing.  Wut? Never again."}
{"text":"THE GOOD:  Food quality is good, some of the dishes are unusual (to me), and I would guess this is more authentic that the average American-style Mexican cuisine.  Nicer interior than most Mexican places. Cloth napkins etc.  Very friendly and well-informed staff, willing to help you customize the dishes for your dietary needs. They know the ingredients and they know what a vegetarian is, as well as what is/isn't gluten free. (They can substitute corn tortillas for wheat flour.)  They apparently have a new separate vegetarian menu on request--I have not yet tried it, but am hopeful it resolves some past problems.  THE BAD:  Considerably less food for a bit more money compared to a run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant. I'm sometimes left hungry unless I want to keep adding more dishes. (Then again, I'm overfull at other Mexican places.)  The old \"Vegetarian\" section of the menu was NOT vegetarian! The servers do know what a vegetarian is, but the old menu did not: vegetarian dishes included beans made with lard (even though non-lard beans were available). The new separate menu sounds like it has probably solved that, as well as adding much-needed variety for vegetarians. I'll update this once I've checked the new menu out."}
{"text":"Tamales were awesome. Loved the refried beans and rice. Chips were excellent. Try the Golden Margarita, they're tasty as well."}
{"text":"My family has been going here for a few years now, mostly at lunch time on Sundays. The food is quite good, in my opinion, but lately they seem to be running the place shorthanded every time we go. It's really hard to get a refill, to get a requested side or extra, or to get the bill in even a remotely timely fashion. You sort of have to stand up and wave both arms to get someone's attention.  Today was a real disappointment. A couple of my family members were at home ill and I was out and about, so I called in an order and went to pick it up on my way home. The person with whom I spoke over the phone read me back the order, so I know it was received correctly. I was told that the order would be ready in ten minutes, and I when I arrived at the restaurant fifteen minutes later, I was worried that I'd allowed everyone's food to get cold. As it turned out, the order came out forty (40) minutes after the initial call. I paid and drove the rest of the way home (three residential Urbana blocks), and upon opening the bags, I found that they'd mistakenly substituted a quesadilla for a cheese enchilada and that some of the items in the bag were COLD - not tepid, but cold as though they'd been prepared and then refrigerated. Since we live quite nearby, I figured I'd call and at least go pick up an enchilada fill out the order as I'd placed it. When the employee picked up the phone, I heard, \"Hello, La Fiesta, just a minute.\" About 30 seconds elapsed, and I heard, \"I'm sorry, go ahead.\" I told him that we had received a quesadilla in place of a cheese enchilada and that I'd like to come by to get the correct item, and again he said, \"I'm sorry, just a minute.\" This time, I could hear over the phone, in the background, that he was seating customers who had walked in, and after about two minutes of this, I hung up and microwaved a meal we'd paid over $30 for.  I'm sorry, but when you mess up someone's order and you have their money already, you TAKE CARE of that situation FIRST. Hire someone if you need to; you can't tell me that there's nobody in this neighborhood looking for a job. My recommendation: The kitchen seems to do pretty well, so it's worth a try, but DO NOT rely on carry out. Once you're out the door, they're done with you."}
{"text":"I've been to La Fiesta twice. It's definitely not the best Mexican I've had, not even close. But it's not terrible. I'd say it's average, good even for the Cleveland area.  Here's my review for my second visit: One big plus is that our server was friendly and attentive to our 1-year-old. She brought a kids' cup and some crackers for the baby, which kept her occupied while we decided and ordered. Another plus, the baby liked all of our food that she tried.  We do like their chips and salsa. A few of the chips tasted burnt, but the others were good. I like that they offer both mild and hot salsa.   We decided to share our meals, ordering an appetizer chicken quesadilla (served with no sides) and a trio of two chicken tacos and a chicken enchilada served with rice and beans.  I also heard that the owners are planning to open a Chipotle-style take-out place next door. We'll be checking that out for sure."}
{"text":"Best margarita in Cleveland, hands down! Amazing staff and service always. Some of the most authentic Mexican food I've had since leaving the home land. Tamales are excellent, posole is perfect, and the pollo con mole is outstanding. If you're not eating here, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Amazing strong margaritas. Everything is super flavorful especially the ground beef. It was all perfectly seasoned. I'm shocked at the other reviews I have been to Mexican restaurants all around the country ad this place is the real deal. Good authentic Mexican with a good price with attentive service."}
