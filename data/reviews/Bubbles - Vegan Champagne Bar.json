{"text":"Although a little hard to find the first time, it's worth the effort. Warm and inviting. Romantic. Alex, the host/owner and staff are attentive but not overly so. A nice variety of champagnes/sparkling wines and the list will probably grow wider as clientele expands. The chocolate souffl√© was delicious and just the right amount for two with an evening sweet tooth. This is a new spot and very quiet and as yet undiscovered. We had a great time with a few friends last night, but will definitely return for a romantic evening for two."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed our date night at Bubbles. It's a cute little champagne bar tucked back in the Agua Caliente shopping center. We loved the brut rose' paired with the goat cheese and fig bruschetta. The owner, Alexis was very friendly and inviting. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fabulous place! Great champagne and great tapas! We had an amazing time and we will be back!"}
{"text":"A fine dining experience with a intimate elegant feel, Bubbles really makes every experience unforgettable! I absolutely love this place, especially when they do live music. It is perfect for a romantic date night or to catch up with your girlfriends.  This place and staff is amazing!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place! The drinks were delicious and so was the cheese plate! The bartender was super nice and fast"}
{"text":"What a charming experience!  Alex, the proprietor, is so eager and engaging and willing to share his philosophy behind the concept for Bubbles that it was difficult not to order one of everything let alone leave. Beautiful ambiance, delicious tapas and champagne choices, delightful music and a charming venue. Discover this gem soon before everyone else does!"}
{"text":"Alexis the owner is very passionate, the atmosphere here is great and the champagne and small food pairing are diverse and delicious! Try the Aubrey champagne!"}
{"text":"Horrible Horrible place. This place has been closed the last 4x I have tried to come. It's finally open and the owners refuse to honor my groupon that's for their conpany! DO NOT GO HERE EVER!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed. The bartender was really rude and unfriendly. The place seemed really dirty as well. I wouldn't recommend going here."}
{"text":"Well. I tried to go here for my birthday. We had a reservation. Got there, and the place wasn't open? I called and nobody answered.  It didn't appear shut down, just not open. On a Saturday night.  Such a disappointment, as we were looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"Great place with fun, unique drinks! I also loved the vegan options of pastries, they were amazing."}
{"text":"This place was a little sketchy at first, especially when we walked in and nobody else was there, but they sure made up for it! The champagne was fantastic, and their avocado toast was incredible! Such a nice place that is tucked away and a little unknown I suppose. I would say that if they took your order at the table and/or brought you your drinks it would have been a little nicer, but the staff was fun and energetic. You don't have to be vegan to enjoy this place. Perfect date night spot and sure to make a wave with a little more attention to service! Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"It does seem like a bit of an odd location as this was the only place open in the complex as far as I could tell at 8pm tonight. My sister and I made reservations to stop in for one of our \"sister dates\", and we were both really happy with our experience! There was one couple when we got there but no other customers, except two more people came later. So we basically had the whole place to ourselves. The guys working here were incredibly nice! They told us about the delicious desserts and let us sample a pomelo bar, it was tasty! The savory food menu looked yummy with all of the toasts, but we ended up just getting treats. My sister got some kind of pecan bar, and I got a brownie that had pop corn, cashews, and a strawberry drizzle on it. My sister got a mimosa-type drink and I got the green apple boba drink. Never thought I'd have boba in prosecco before but it was cool! Only complaint was that I couldn't seem to get the boba in the straw enough so at the end there was a ton of boba left and no champagne. My sister loved her mimosa! Our treats were delicious too. I'd never think to have popcorn on a brownie, I was surprised at how good it tasted. I plan to come back sometime this place was really cute!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!   My girlfriends and I celebrated our friend's birthday there last night and we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  The champagne and food are well worth the price.  The food is prepared fresh and to order and is exquisite.  We're all very excited to go back again soon and check out the live music!  Bryn DeFusco"}
{"text":"Nice and cozy place. The owner is  very friendly. We tried the Pata Negra and it was outstanding, unique. Champagne is at a reasonable price. We will come back. I recommend."}
{"text":"Imagine a mimosa..  now imagine a glass about half the size of a normal champagne glass... imagine about a tablespoon of champagne and then top it off with fruit juice... imagine looking around you too see an unfinished bar... imagine slow service... now.. the best of all... imagine paying $14 for one 'mimosa'! And, there you have it, is Bubbles. Dont waste your money."}
{"text":"We were stoked to see a vegan champagne bar opened and REALLY wanted this place to be cool but our experience with their overpriced badly made cocktails and strip mall ambience left us utterly disappointed.  There was an overwhelming smell of sulfur as soon as we walked in which may have been coming from the salon next door as we were assured that smell did not originate in their bar.  The place itself reminded me of a vacant nail salon that furniture had quickly been moved into in order to create a new business.  The music being played was a local radio channel.  As I mentioned before, the drinks were overpriced and not well made.  Neither my partner nor I were happy with our drinks.  We didn't try much of the food, just a couple dessert items which were the highlight of our visit.  Hoping they can make a better go of this in the future.  Also, don't worry if you don't have a reservation as the website suggests, the place was nearly empty when we were there."}
{"text":"This is such a sweet little place. I love the intimacy of it. I've only been for drinks, champagne and champagne cocktails, so I can't review the food. I'm curious, too, about their brunch. I also like that the art on the walls is by local artists, for sale and regularly rotated out."}
{"text":"A vegan Champagne bar? How glorious! Anyone who knows me knows that if a Champagne bar exists in any given city, I'm going to find it and go there. But a vegan Champagne bar? There is a god, I guess.  I was in Scottsdale for several days for a work conference and had a free night to get dinner. I'll be honest. I was expecting more from you Phoenix/Scottsdale. I didn't see a plethora of enticing options on Yelp when I searched, but then Bubbles popped up (heh) and I suddenly decided that I'm moving to Scottsdale because in all my travels, I have never encountered a vegan Champagne bar with a variety of small plates and sweet dreamy things like lemon bars, brownies and more.   Did it live up to every expectation? Yes! As others say, the staff is lovely, the space is charming and the food is excellent. The bread they use is simply incredible, with a chewy/toasty texture and whether you get avocado, cashew cheese, hummus or even their faux gras, it's the perfect compliment to the toast. I ordered both the cashew cheddar and stoner toast (popcorn! I'm so putting popcorn on top of my hummus and maybe even avocado toast in the future!)   There's a nice selection of bubbly both by the glass and bottle and it arrives perfectly cold to your table (oh how I despise when places bring half flat and slightly cooler-than-tepid champers to you). Buy two glasses and your third is complimentary (at least on a Thursday night. I'd check to make sure as their specials do change).   I absolutely loved the shortbread part of my lemon bar (of course I ordered one) and the lemon portion is tasty, although possibly because it was cold, was rather firm and kept separating from the shortbread.   Will you feel kinda like a baller when you get the bill? Um, you've been drinking Champagne, people. The toasts and sweets are all priced similar to what you'd expect of small plates. Portions are generous.   Please support this place, local vegans. I know you're out there! I would make this my regular if I lived in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Completely Dead. Bad customer service. Go anywhere but here. I'm surprised this place hasn't closed down."}
