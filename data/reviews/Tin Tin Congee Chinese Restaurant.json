{"text":"Hey people this place is still open as of May 9/2017 went for some Chinese food so I don't where some yelpers say is closed, location next to osmon wrap  food is good"}
{"text":"For a college kid like myself, I think Tin Tin Congee is an absolute godsend. It's cheap, cheerful and gets the job done. 

When I ordered a $4.50 bowl of noodles, was I expecting a 5 star gourmet? Absolutely not. The fact of the matter is that it is a small restaurant and it doesn't make a very high margin on its products so you can absolutely expect the quality to be on the lower end. That said, for the price you pay, the value you get is excellent. 

For anyone reading this review, I would highly recommend something more Asiatic and off the beaten path of the typical Manchu Wok fare- for the adventurous I'd say to order the congee and for the more casual diner I'd recommend the noodle in soup. Neither of which will rack you up a bill more than 7 bucks a person (delivery included) and are more than satisfactory for a single person.

I also appreciate their delivery- prompt and with a driver who possesses the quiet humility of a Tibetan monk. The restaurant owner even called and welcomed me as a first time orderer which is both security on her end, and tells me as a patron that she wanted me to come back. I thought this was a nice touch.

Regarding the other reviews here, I think they give the place a little bit too much flak for a small Chinese restaurant. Is it like the duck a l'orange that you'd find in a sweet French cafe? Definitely not. But will it stretch your buck farther than any other place on the York Campus, you can definitely bet your ass."}
{"text":"I came here in a group of three on a cold night looking for some salty and spicy food.  
As soon as I walked in I was greeted by a lady with a super cute baby in an otherwise totally empty establishment.  What was amazing was that this baby throughout our whole dining experience was smiling and staring at us the entire time.  She must've been 3 months old.  Laughing and smiling all the time.  So we started the dinner with a good vibe.

Remember, this is right across York University -- so I know their target market.  The prices are cheap and there's a copy of the menu on the storefront window that had everything I was looking for: chilli chicken, chicken fried rice, beef with black bean sauce.  Salty, spiced, fried comfort food.

I ordered and then shortly after I heard a bunch of frying and cooking noises coming from the kitchen.  The food took about 15 minutes during which time we were given our pitcher of water with cups.  

The food tasted fresh.  Normally hakka style chinese food takes 2 minutes to be served from the time you place your order.  This place clearly wasn't busy enough to have pots of the stuff ready to serve so it means they make it a little fresh for you.  Was it outstanding? No.  But...All of us were pleasantly surprised.  Because it was exactly what we were all looking for.  We all got full and left happy, like that chubby little baby."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim because of a craving for fried rice noodle with beef (gon chow ngow haw). The place is small, but clean and bright. 

We ordered two things originally: fried beef noodle with sliced beef in soya sauce, and dumpling soup. After perusing the menu some more, we also added the marinated beef noodle. 

Fried beef noodle with soya sauce was good! Not too salty and not heavy on the soy sauce. There was a lot of bean sprouts and onions, more than I usually see in this dish. They were quite crunchy, which is great for the bean sprouts, but I wish the onions were cooked a little bit longer. The sliced beef was fantastic - sliced thick and extremely tender. 

The dumpling noodle was great too. Dumplings were really big and you get 5 in a bowl. It's packed full of shrimp, bamboo shoots, and wood ear mushrooms. The broth is also light and not salty either. I liked how there was shredded ginger in the broth for flavour. 

The marinated beef noodle was easily our most favourite. A combination of shank and brisket, each beef piece was tender and super flavourful. There's just enough spice in here to be considered spicy, but not overly. Add in some really fresh bok choy and  a generous helping of thick cut noodles, this bowl was extremely satisfying. 

The only thing to keep in mind is that service is a little slow. Don't expect food to come flying out of the kitchen, but you can hear everything that's going on in the kitchen so you know your food is made fresh to order. 

Definitely a good place to return to for some good ol' comfort Cantonese food. Next time I want to try their congee."}
{"text":"Decent food for good price! We head there at noon on Sunday and it was not busy, which our family prefer than other crowded Chinese restaurant! 
Washroom is definitely much much cleaner and nicer than the washrooms at other Chinese restaurant. Lol."}
{"text":"The food has turned my stomach inside out. On the first bit, there was hair. I paid $26, even tipped the driver, and I have eaten nothing. I asked nicely for a refund, and was refused. After a huge argument, the owner told me I had to come in for a refund. Ubering there and back would cost me half the price of my meal. They finally agreed to send the driver back, yet I'm still waiting. The food was 45 minutes late as well, and after a single bite, I feel sick to my stomach. Never order food from here."}
{"text":"If there is not a driver at my door with a refund by 2:30pm, I will be notifying the health inspectors about my experience."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time yesterday with a couple friends and it was delicious and well priced! Loved it :)"}
{"text":"Location:4205 Keele Street (right next to York University)
Price: $$
Service: Good

A friend and I ordered food for delivery yesterday. To our surprise the food was really good! It took around 45mins- an hour for the food to arrive- it shouldn't take that long if it is literally across the street from YorkU. It was hard to order the food since there was no menu and I had to look it up on yelp. They also didn't give us a menu when they delivered the food either. The frustrating thing about this delivery was that they added an extra order and charged us for it, then we had to call them back and get the food. It's always frustrating to play phone tag.

We ordered; fried rice noodles with beef and vegetables, sweet and sour pork (soo good!), beef and broccoli, and hot and sour soup (decent and it would be best if you ordered the small cause the medium size and massive). The food was really fresh and yummy.

Verdict: good to order =D"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Chicken curry and rice as well as fried wontons.  Told them to specifically make the chicken curry extra spicy.  

Order arrived in good time, and it looked to be decent portions in styrofoam containers.  Mind you, delivery must be at least $25.00.  

Fried wontons were crunchy and had some random piece of pork at the centre. I have only had it one other time and it didn't have this at this other establisment where I ordered.  Still yummy though.  1 star for this.  

Curry chicken had much left to be desired.  Wasn't spicy at all and had a watery consistency.  I had actually anticipated the dense curry flavour, but was left wondering where it all was?  The chicken looked to be all dark meat, when you picked through the mqss array if skin and bone.  Skin! Ew! No preparation needed to make this meal.  I just opted to eat the friend wontons.  

Thankfully I ordered the fried wonton as it made up basically the entire meal.  

Next time I will take the advice of fellow yelpers more seriously."}
{"text":"All day $7 specials near York University....what's not to like?

They call themselves a Congee house with 14 items

But they have over 100 traditional Chinese dishes so they offer more

Place seats 30 or so people so bring a group and order a pile f dishes and eat and eat well

This is the only chinese  place I have come across
That offers a Cullen or Doughnut on the menu

Enjoy a beef tripe & turnip with a Pork Liver Congee and a hot tea"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese congee and other great dishes - great tasty portions for price! Right across the university - highly recommend for anyone looking for convenient, homemade tasting cooking."}
{"text":"I believe this is the closest Cantonese place to the York University area. It is located in a modest strip plaza with plenty of parking. Ordered won ton noodle soup, some fried noodle dishes, and congee. This is a very small place, but the food was decent, and the prices were cheap. Service was friendly. I would come again."}
{"text":"Was surprised to find this clean and tasty congee-noodle house in this part of the city.  The portions are good and the price cheap like Chinatown.  They have a TV which broadcasts various Chinese cooking shows. They fry their own fritter sticks which is a plus."}
{"text":"It was only 1st visit (I walked out of neighbor Aji Sushi for rude service)   but can't  complain becuase they prepared the dish (Hunan Beef) exactly as I asked (suicide-spicy).  No dirt or debris in food like most downtown TO \"authentic\"  restaurants, so good enough for me."}
{"text":"1.5 star

Expectation was set pretty low even when I stepped inside Tin Tin. 

One good thing about the Wonton Noodle Soup ($4.50) I ordered, portion size is huge. 

But the wontons though big and the shrimp is the bigger ones with a good bouncy bite.... but there is ton of uncleaned intestine.. 

I was thirsty and this dry mouth feel afterwards. A little heavy in MSG. 

But Tin Tin might be perfect match for the area as it is right across York U. I still remember my University days that I was on a tight budget and always hungry!"}
{"text":"Tonight for dinner at work we decided to order from Tin Tin Congee. I have to start off by saying i like the decor of the restaurant. It had a very homey feeling. You can tell it is family run.

The food itself was pretty bland with not much taste. we ordered the following:

-Taiwanese Chicken 
-beef egg poached congee
-Lai Wei Congee
-rice roll and xo sauce

By far the best was the Taiwanese chicken. The taste was pretty authentic. The beef egg poached congee was given to us with chicken instead of beef and you could tell they used water instead of broth. The rice roll with xo sauce was very bland with little to no taste. 

I would recommend the Taiwanese chicken out of everything we ordered. You can not complain about the price though. Everything is well priced with great sized portions."}
