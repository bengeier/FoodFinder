{"text":"The Laurel has always had one of my favorite Reuben sandwiches.  Last night I convinced my son to have one as well.  We both ordered them and drat -- they have changed their corned beef.  This is the first time I have ever had a Reuben that tasted like it was made with bologna -- not pleasant at all.  I hope they go back to their old corned beef for people's sake.  I doubt we'll go back t find out.  YUK."}
{"text":"Had not been here in years so decided on Badger game away would have lunch & watch game here. The food absolutely fantastic, one of the tastiest Veggie Burgers around. Standard bar food, nothing fancy, exceptionally good. Decent selections of beer on tap, good variety of local craft beers. My big problem & the reason I decided to leave & go watch Badger game elsewhere, there is no wi-fi network. Bartender told me depending on carrier may not be able to do anything on phone. She was absolute right, as could not even send a text, she referred to it as a dead zone. In 2016 how can you own a Sports bar & not have a wi-if connection available for your customers?  Will I come back for a burger now & then, probably would, but am I going to stay for extra beers when my phone is not usable, probably not."}
{"text":"My family LOVES the Laurel Tavern! One of the best fish frys in Madison and an even better prime rib on Saturday night! We also love going there on Thursdays for their prime rib sandwhich special. Their burgers are just average but their specials will make up for it!!!!!"}
{"text":"We have loved the Laurel in the past but tonight they were awful on all points.  Took my girlfriend for her Birthday dinner unfortunately. We were told 30-35 mins and were seated almost an hour and a half later.  Rail booze old fashioned was $6.25 per.  Don't mind paying for a good drink but thought that was high for a neighborhood bar.  When I asked another bartender what a bourbon old fashioned cost he stated $5.  The last time we were there they were $3.75 so not sure where the price list resides.....and no it was not a happy hour issue. Hash browns were other-worldly.  Like no other I've ever had and we dine out often and hash browns are a go-to for me.  Our normally fab walleye were both way overcooked.  Never offered the night specials while other tables were.  She never stopped back after setting the plates down.  The hostess did clear the salad plates and brought our check 10 mins after we finished. Never offered dessert.  I will say the salad was acceptable. I have never left such a crappy tip in life but I thought it was deserved. It was not a \"it wasn't the waitress' fault\" as she played a major part in the failed birthday dinner. Honestly one of the worst dining experiences ever not sure when we'll go back.  Might ha try someplace new after this. We thought maybe we peed someone off there?  We went through the scenario and could not come up with anything we may have did or said-nothing.  I did gp and check on our table after an hour or so??? I have heard Fitz' on the Lake and Villa Tap both have good walleye might try those next."}
{"text":"Good food. Local crowd. Good selection of taps. One of my fave spots to take in a game."}
{"text":"Went with two classy broads that are just friends but I'd entertain the notion of clapping under the right circumstances. Great atmosphere, feels like you're in a down home supper club despite being located on the yuppy cesspool known as Monroe Street (tho outta that part of it). The kinda establishment you could take your racist grandma to, or, because it's so outta the way, your side hoe. Stellar beer selection. All three of us ordered the so called \"best Reuben around\" (quite a bold claim) and some fried shit. Everything went down the word-hole real nice. Certainly the best Reuben in that neighborhood, once you start expanding what \"around\" means that claim gets real trumpy. Waitstaff was quite nice, and granted it was busy af (Saturday eve) didn't come around til post eating & I was fixing to get the beers going. Also, doesn't seem like a very Mary Jane friendly place, although we were grounded so I couldn't say for sure. Very Hebrew friendly however."}
{"text":"By far the best fish fry in town.  Also best old fashioned (but ask Diane to make it for you!).  Always packed on Friday night but turnover is quick.  Family friendly and family run.  One of my favorite restaurants in Madison for 14 years running."}
{"text":"I have been to the Laurel a handful of times, and my most recent visit was the worst out of them all. The food is OK, nothing too fancy, just your typical bar food. The prices aren't bad but I have yet to receive good service at the Laurel. The last visit the waitress was so rude, you could tell that she didn't even want to be there. My friends and I had called ahead of time to ask if there was a wait, we were told there wasn't one, less than ten minutes later when we arrive, there are several people lined up waiting for a table. How do you go from no wait to having several parties waiting for a table? While waiting for a table this particular waitress was rude when we asked her how long the wait would be. Her response was \"I have no clue, you are just going to have to wait\". When we were finally seated and handed menus, she walked away for several minutes before returning to take our drink order. When she finally came back to get our order she proceeded to walk away before all of us finished ordering. She then proceeded to ignore not only us, but other restaurant patrons as well, when we (and they) tried to flag her down for a simple request (requests for a refill, additional cutlery etc). Now I'm not expecting for any waitress to be overly friendly and bubbly, but this woman was clearly in a horrible mood. No smile, no how are you, how can I help you, nothing. I have never received friendly service at the Laurel, which is one of the reasons I don't go there often. Not only did this waitress have a foul mood, but she made it known that she did not give a rats a** about anything. One of my friends decided not to tip her at all because she was very rude the entire time, and my friend was so disgusted by this woman's attitude. My friend has ALWAYS left a tip no matter how shitty the service, but in this situation she felt that this woman did not provide the service one would expect. Come to find out a few weeks later, that this waitress wrote in a $2 tip on the credit card receipt, after my friend had written a ZERO in the tip section. Who does that? I will NEVER return to this place again. I have also heard that other newbies or people that don't come here often have complained about service before, and that those complaints were not taken seriously.   If you are a regular, chances are you will be treated way better, but if you are a newbie or someone that doesn't frequent this establishment often, do not expect fair or even decent customer service. If you don't care about the quality of service, and want a good greasy burger, then by all means visit this place."}
{"text":"I usually order the hot dog which is something like 3/4 lb. The mini corn dogs, which are bite-sized, hence the title, are a good finger-food appetizer. The fries are a bit of a disappointment in my mind however. I am not a fan of crinkle-cut fries, which is how the Laurel serves them, because the crinkles keep the heat in and when you pop them in your mouth they are SCALDING hot. They only taste good if you leave them to cool down for like 20-30 minutes. They have a lot of sandwiches, which I don't order because I just don't order sandwiches, but I have heard they are decent. The burgers, though small, are pretty good, but the Reubens are awful. Usually my dad orders a Bleu Cheese Reuben, but lately he just isn't a fan anymore. He says they don't make them like they used to. So one day we went there, and he orders Buffalo wings instead of his usual BC Reuben, right? Well not to elaborate but I had a wing and they were horrible. The Laurel has definitely been on a steady decline in service and taste since Gates and Brovi showed up down the road.  Some good points to The Laurel, though: they're drinks are really well made, they pride themselves on that, being a bar, and they have a game room with a pool table and dartboard when you walk in via the lot entrance and TVs everywhere, so really, the only good business they get anymore is on big game nights. I personally do like this place over Gates and Brovi, but The Laurel just isn't what it used to be, and I expect them to peter out in a couple of years."}
{"text":"Solid neighborhood bar.  Good burgers and a very decent Friday Night fish fry.  Always give a substantial amount of sides and the service has always been good.  One of the favorite places for my kids to go to so also great for families.  Its been here for quite some time so obviously they are doing things right.  You can be sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Disclosure: we're rating this solely based on our one take-out experience of Fish Friday.   We got an order of walleye with hashbrowns o'brian and salad, and cod with fries and coleslaw to go.  The fish were excellent, flaky and tender,  with the perfect ratio of batter and fish.  Even after the 20 minutes of getting home,  the fish stayed hot and crunchy.   The woman at the bar that checked us out wasn't too friendly,  maybe it was because we used a restaurant.com coupon, maybe it was an off day. I'd definitely come back and get take-out fish again."}
{"text":"This place is the quintessential American tavern. Cheap greasy food and beer. The couple times ive been in the staff is always friendly and attentive and the food is pretty good. I typically gonwoth the basic burger and fry but their ruban isnt too bad either."}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: homey, busy fish fry.  Four of us stopped by this unassuming brick bar on Monroe for a Friday night fish fry to find it packed to the brim. There's a long bar area, a back room with a pool table, and a side dining room. All were filled with seated and standing patrons. We were quoted 45 minutes but ended up waiting closer to an hour and a half. Such is life. We partook in some decent Old Fashioneds and beers in the meantime.  Once seated we ordered immediately. I got their Fried Cod with hash browns o'brien and a side salad ($11.95). Our waitress was hurried and kind of non-existent due to the crowd, but out food came out very fast. My cod was solid fried fish fare, and the wife's fries were good. But my venture into the o'briens was a poor decision; the hashbrowns were burnt and the cheese on top seemed to be a slice of melted Kraft. It appeared unnaturally square.  Overall I enjoyed my fish fry at Laurel Tavern for a townie stop. I wouldn't go out of my way, though."}
{"text":"Pretty standard bar food. I would not recommend it unless you were in the mood for simple fried or grilled food. Maybe a beer too if you're a middle-aged Packers fanatic. It's a cozy little old-American joint that honestly just reminds me of life in the suburbs, minus the gigantic portions."}
{"text":"In case you were wondering if Kate T's comment about free drinks with Packer touchdowns is still true, I can assure you that it is.  Just think about a 6 touchdown rout over the Giants....six drinks per person!   The Laurel has a good selection of tap beers, a decent amount of bar food apps, and I've heard their fish fry Fridays are amazing and cheap.   The only drawback is that the bartenders basically need to be smacked in order to notice you unless you already know them. It felt as though they really didn't want me to drink, which stands directly in contrast to what I want while watching a do or die Packer game.   If you live in the area, or if the packers are playing a weak team, come here. It will be worth your while!"}
{"text":"This review is based, solely, on the service aspect because we didn't stay to experience the food. We stopped by for a casual lunch on 7/14/14 at around 2:15pm, there was nobody up front. After sitting and waiting for someone to appear for a bit, my boyfriend stuck his head in back to give the bartender a heads up we were there. This to which he received a very unenthusiastic response. She came out and said \"what do u want to drink\" with a pretty significant eye role. Needless to say, we will not be offering our business to a place that treats their customers like this. Note to management: I read a couple reviews that resemble our experience, today. This isn't a one time incident."}
{"text":"Saturday prime rib special was very good. Food came out quickly. Confusing set up when you enter the restaurant... I asked another customer if there was a host to be seated with and they said yes. After standing for a bit, I had to ask a waitress how long the wait was for three people.  If I hadn't said anything, I'm not even sure whether they would've greeted me at all. Considering they were not a full house, I was surprised at the lack of customer service overall. Our server seemed irritated with our questions of her recommendations on the menu. Food was good but service could use improvement. Again, not extremely busy so perhaps there was a rush before we got there, causing the staff to be irritable by the time we got there, but it was only 7:30 so seemed relatively early in the night. Food was 4/5, service 2/5."}
{"text":"This place is an old stand by. We have always had good bar food and drinks here and return whenever we can. Their burgers are right up there in my top ten places to go and its a young fun crowd."}
{"text":"The current free drink policy is one free drink ticket for the first Packer touchdown of each half when you already have an alcoholic drink in front of you. Less generous, but still nice (although I hear rumors that the High Noon Saloon gives out free shots for every Packer TD, \"my  people\" are here)."}
{"text":"Positive: battered and deep fried green bean fries are novel if, uh, way overpriced and tasted like they were fried at a carnival.  Negative: what is a thick slice of raw onion doing in their signature patty melt? The whole time I was thinking, \"somebody better complain about this because this is way gross.\"  Please someone comment or message me a suggestion of a place that I don't drop $14+tip for a patty melt and a side and then hate it. I would love to do a positive review of something because hitting misses is unsatisfying."}
{"text":"Comfortable, relaxing neighborhood  place. We bring the whole family.  It wouldn't be a destination restaurant, but we live nearby, so we return again and again. Simple burgers and fries menu. I wish they  served fresh tomatoes on the burgers."}
{"text":"A definite contender for our \"Winchester\" -our go-to neighborhood pub like The Winchester in the movie Shawn of the Dead."}
{"text":"Two of my friends and I went there on April 4, 2015 to watch Wisconsin play Kentucky in the Final Four. There were five or six guys at the end of the bar by the door on Monroe Street who were extremely inebriated. As they game went on they got louder and more boisterous, yelling at everything, good or bad, that happened. They used the F-word in almost every sentence, often multiple times, yelling at the TV. \"What the f*#k kind of call was that? F*#k, yes, that's the way to do it.\" I walked over nicely and said hello, said I hoped that they were enjoying the game and asked nicely if they would refrain from using the F-word. The said \"No\" and were upset I even asked. I then asked Dave, the bartender, nicely if he would say something and he said, \"No.\" I was stunned. One of the guys yelling then went outside to have a cigarette. When I turned to look that way he made threatening gestures towards me indicating he wanted me to come out and fight, which I ignored. When the game was over he came up to me, was very aggressive and tried to engage me in a argument. At one point, another bartender looked at me and said something to the effect, \"they're just having a good time.\" If I recall, Dave said they were there drinking when he got there at 6 PM. While the behavior of these guys is horrible, I'm more surprised and disgusted that the staff would over serve them, tolerate such horrible behavior that was making the other patrons in uncomfortable and rationalize it as just some guys having fun. Not only did the behavior create a very uncomfortable environment, I felt unsafe by the aggressive behavior. After I told Dave about the aggressive behavior and that I did not feel safe, he volunteered to walk me to my car. Frustrated we couldn't leave without missing the game, we stayed."}
{"text":"Small neighborhood tavern with lots of regulars,  it seems. I had a great burger and a couple of beers. Great service from friendly staff."}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars. This is bar food. This isn't great service, fancy atmosphere. The service isn't the friendliest but they get the job done. They do have a game room with a pool table and dart board but they don't always work. Drinks are good. The one thing I will say I love about the place is the grilled cheese!!!! Best bar grilled cheese I've ever had. You get to pick your cheese and pick your bread. Plus the bar chairs are awesome. They are tall, cushy, and they swivel. This isn't the best establishment but it's a decent neighborhood bar that I think will continue to grow on me. Oh and I'd like to add that yes the fries are crinkle cut but I think they are great!!"}
{"text":"Went here with my husband because we had a Restaurant.com certificate. It had been rumbling around in a drawer for over a year when we found it the other day - hooray for no expiration dates!   Laurel Tavern struck me as more bar than restaurant - shocking, with \"tavern\" in the name, right? It was a Monday night and their happy hour special was simply 50 cents off. As such, paying $4.75 for a pint of Ciderboys was a bit steep, in my opinion (and that was with the 50 cents off).   We started with cheese curds - they were awesome. My husband ordered the cheeseburger and fries special. Toppings are a la carte, apparently, and he wishes he had added some onion to it. He says it was a fine burger but nothing exciting.   I ordered the pizza burger. It came with pizza sauce and cheese on it. I thought the sauce tasted more marinara-y than pizza-y. Overall a bit bland.   Employees were friendly. It's too bad the food wasn't a little better - we'd probably go back if it were."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere in this place. I went to learn a card game with a meetup group and had a very nice time. It's a great spot to be able to hear each other talk, and they accommodated a larger group of people (about 14, I think?) between two tables.  I ordered the chili dog, which was just ducky (I mean... it's a chili dog... can you really go wrong with a chili dog that's not made with Man-Wich?). My guy ordered a burger. Both of us were satisfied. The fries were good too--not too oily, and tasted like they change the fry oil out often (which is a big pet peeve of mine with other places).  I had an old fashioned--which was a-okay. BF had Snowshoe on tap (a basic beer that's dern good).  There's a little private lot on the side, and it was mostly empty on a Sunday evening.  I'll definitely go back. Next time, I'll bring Exploding Kittens.  ;)"}
{"text":"Good reuben and excellent beer selection.  But then again, there's really no such thing as a bad reuben.  I like drinking and eating here, but  am a little put off by the ever-present intense west-side badger fans screaming about how you have to protect players and break the legs of other teams every time I go.  Love the mural, however.  Hot."}
{"text":"The Good: Service was very fast, and it was a busy Friday night. Beer selection was great. Had a lot of local beers on tap which is always a plus for me.   The Meh: The food. Nothing was bad, in fact I would even say it was a decent meal. It just wasn't memorable. I have been to a lot of fish fry places in Madison, and all of them had something I remember, from the ambiance, to the food quality, or even the drinks. I feel like in 3 months I won't remember anything about the fish fry at the Laurel. So for me, there are many better fish fry options in Madison that I would go back to before the Laurel."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar with friendly staff.  I love a local taven and will gladly try it out wherever and whenever I happen across one. A large bar on the left greets you when you walk in from Monroe Street.  There are also some seating in the bar area as well as a separate dining room.  The interior is cozy and welcoming.  The beer selection is your typical local offering.  Some macro and craft beers but nothing too extreme or unique. On the food side, expect appetizers, burgers. sandwiches, and the like.  I opted for the bremaster burger-cheddar, pickles, fried onions, lettuce and a mustard garlic sauce.  Clocking in at a 1/3 pound, I found it to be very average.  The fried onions were cloying sweet and the mustard garlic sauce didn't do anything for me.  Yes, definitely cheaper than those that can be found on Monroe St ($6.45) but I would gladly pay more for a burger that deliver flavorwise.  Our waitress was sweet and I wouldn't hesitate to stop in when I am in the neighborhood to grab a beer but save my appetite for somewhere else."}
{"text":"I came here for a celebration with a large group and unfortunately a couple members of the group didn't tip. Don't know why, but they didn't. Super shitty of them. Even more shitty was that the waitress came over to our table and confronted us about it, complaining. When we told her that it was super shitty and we were sorry and would definitely make up for it she responded by saying things like, \"Oh, no it's fine. Don't worry about it.\" If it was fine, why did you come to our table just to complain to us about it?  I am consistently disappointed with a couple of the waitresses here because of this attitude and their vocalization in response to it."}
{"text":"Good food, bad service. Our waitress was so rude I couldn't believe it. We came in on a Sunday around 2 p.m. to a minimally filled restaurant and never got even a \"hi\". We received a \"what do you want to drink?\" I had to get our own menus and service was slow.  On the bright side, there was a younger gentleman there working in the back who popped out to help the tables our waitress was ignoring (I hope that isn't true, but it sure felt like it!) and he was as friendly as can be. Thanks to him, we were able to order and be treated like we were wanted there. I wish I could say it was a fluke, but judging from another customer I heard complaining to our waitress about her service, I'd say I wasn't the only one dissatisfied here."}
{"text":"The fish fry, for the price, is the best in Madison - and I mean it. 3 big pieces of walleye with a potato side and soup or salad m8? Sign me up. Don't go between 5 and 7:30 on Friday   Otherwise it is a neighborhood bar. Try the Scotch ale."}
{"text":"I've been here a lot, as I live literally two blocks away.  My best memories are coming here with my whole family and my Grandparents when they came to town. My Grandpa would let me have the cherries from his Brandy Old Fashioned, and I would always get the Chicken Tenders.   I was recently here for my graduation, and we had a party of seven. It looked like the fireplace table, what I would assume to be the largest table in the restaurant, had cleared, so the waitress cleaned it up for us and seated us quickly. She was kind and helpful when ordering for us. In fact, when she asked us what the occasion was (we were all dressed up), and we told her that it was Graduation night, she told us that her brother had also graduated from my school just a few years back, and my brother told her that he knew him. Small world, huh?  The food was good as always, and since it was getting later, so the restaurant was starting to empty, so we headed home.  I would definitely recommend this place if you have the chance to come here. As other reviewers have said, one of the best things about this place is the atmosphere. It's just really nice.  Will come again."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were looking for a nice spot for lunch before hitting Trader Joe's and thought the Laurel Tavern looked like it would be just the place for some good grilled burgers.  We were sorely disappointed.  He ordered the mushroom burger and I had the bistro burger (sauce, lettuce, tomato).  Both of our sandwiches were completely tasteless. No grill flavor at all - in fact all I could taste was that the sauce which seemed like mostly mustard.  The fries were just OK.  We have to be careful with money and don't get to go out that much, so this was a real disappointment.  The only reason we would return might be to try the fish fry."}
{"text":"Excellent Friday fish. This is a great neighborhood bar and restaurant that's been around forever. Friendly and cozy."}
{"text":"It's been years since I dropped by the Laurel, so when I was running some errands in the Dudgeon-Monroe neighborhood the other day, I thought I would pay my old haunt a visit.  I'm always a sucker for a good Reuben, so I selected the \"Best Reuben Around\" from the menu along with a bowl of chili.    After eating the Reuben, I would consider renaming the sandwich more along the lines of \"The Best Reuben within a Stone's Throw\".  It was an OK rendition of the classic sandwich but nothing worth getting too excited about.    When I first saw the sandwich, I almost considered returning it, since it looked like it was burnt to a crisp.  However, that was more a function of the color of the rye bread rather than too much time on the griddle.  I really enjoyed the bread component of the sandwich.  The thick slices of marble rye held up well to the moist interior and the time on the griddle added a nice crunch for some textural contrast with no greasiness.  I also was pleased to notice there was no caraway in the bread.  The weakest link of the sandwich was the dressing.  It was watery and didn't add a lot of flavor.  Meh.  The sauerkraut, while applied in the right proportion was light on flavor and crunch.  The corned beef was your average tavern-grade meat, it was lean and tender, but didn't wow me with the flavor.  I also you have liked more corned beef on a sandwich with no sides that set me back $7.45.  The chili was above average bar food and had a homemade taste and feel.  It had none of the problems often encountered with bar chili.  It didn't have the grittiness that occurs from adding too much chili powder.  It was loaded with tender ground beef and tomatoes, giving it more of a stew-like consistency versus the soupy consistency of some bar chili variants.  Most importantly, it didn't have the greasiness that plagues other versions of this dish.  While far from transcendent, I'll definitely consider grabbing a bowl the next time I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Burgers and fries are a little pricey for what you get but the service is quick and the environment is nice. Pretty good environment for kids too; at least during the lunch period and on a weekend."}
{"text":"Prepare to wait 30-45 minutes for a table during the peak Friday Fish Fry hours but it's definitely worth the wait if you relish lightly battered walleye or well-seasoned baked cod with the traditional salad starter and super reasonably priced brandy old fashioned's.  The long and narrow bar area becomes quite crowded at dinner and you may need to work a little bit harder than usual to get the bartenders' attention. There are a couple 2-top bar tables that are first-come-first-serve and a back waiting room area that is more suitable if you have children in tow."}
{"text":"loves the fish sammich.  the drinks are very good, but they sometimes come in these ridiculous tear drop shaped glasses, which make the manly act of ordering a scotch and soda less manly.  good place for a drink."}
{"text":"Best cheese curds in Madison! Service is generally not very good they can be slow and don't seem to care if you need anything after food is dropped off.  Prices are a little high for bar food.  But poor service and slightly high prices wont keep me from going back for curds."}
{"text":"The laurel has become our packer game day bar. The food is standard (but great) Wisconsin bar food, and the burgers are stellar. They have a good beer selection, but they recently took velveteen habit off tap which is seriously disappointing! Please get it back! Service is great. Lots of TVs to watch the game. It's a nice laid back neighborhood place to enjoy a good meal and a few drinks."}
{"text":"Great fish fry! Came here on a Friday night and really enjoyed the fish fry. We started with the fried green beans, which were fantastic! They were very lightly breaded and the green beans were fresh and juicy. Great appetizer.   I went with the walley fish fry with hash brown o'briens. The walley was superb. The fish tasted great and the breading was crispy. The hash browns were ok. They came with cheese, peppers, and onions. The potatoes ended up a bit soggy. I should have went with the baked potato."}
