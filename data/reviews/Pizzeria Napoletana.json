And the desert was below average.
They only take cash 
Wont be going to this pizzeria anytime soon"}

{"text":"Il ne suffirait que de régler le service (plus qu'ordinaire) et ce restaurant mériterait amplement un 5 étoiles. Pour avoir essayer plusieurs pizzas, je n'ai jamais été déçu! Portion généreuse, saveurs au rendez-vous... Bref on goute vraiment l'Italie!! Mais bon, jamais plaisant de boire son vin blanc dans un verre (à eau) encore fumant du lave vaisselles. Et ce n'est pas un cas isolé -_-"}
{"text":"I really feel that this restaurant is overrated. Based on the reviews, we were looking forward to some great authentic Italian pizza and food. I think the glowing positive reviews must have been written after a bottle or two of wine because the saving grace of this place is that it is BYOW. 

The food: we ordered 3 pizzas (#33, #15, #3) , and they were all pretty bland and very sparse on ingredients. The thin crust was so hard it felt like we were eating a cracker with sauce and toppings. If you're going to charge $18 for a pizza with sauce, basil and Buffalo mozzarella I don't think it's unreasonable to put more than 3 small pieces of cheese and 2 small sprigs of basil on it...quite disappointing overall on the pizza front. The pasta - we ordered Gnocchi with tomatoe sauce and pennine al forno, super basic italian staples that were edible but again bland and lacking flavour. I've made tastier tomatoe sauce at home.  

The atmosphere: this place looks like an outdated casse croûte fast food restaurant with big communal tables, paper printed coasters and a bunch of very eclectic decor hung everywhere (a giant Mona Lisa, huge fake tree, a big painting of an Italian soccer team, a landscape mural painted over one wall...I could go on). This is not a romantic restaurant to bring a date to by any means or even a pleasant night out with friends. Incredibly loud to the point of having to shout at someone sitting next to you, very bright lighting, several large screen TVs playing sports and no wine glasses. Yes...it is a BYOW restaurant where you must drink your wine out of regular water glasses . We kept waiting for them to bring some out until we looked around and saw everyone else using the water glasses to pour wine in. 

I know I sound like a grumpy old lady but we were a trio of 30 year olds just wanting some tasty Italian and someplace chill to drink the good wine we brought. This place failed us and we will not be back. A $140 bill for 3 people with no alcohol included is a bit steep for the value here. There are just too many other amazing restaurant options in Montreal to go to mediocre ones like this one."}
{"text":"Situated in the heart of Little Italy, Pizzeria Napoletana is known for it's thin-crust Naples style pizzas. We went there on a Thursday night and there were at least 10 people waiting outside on the sidewalk for their turn: and it was not even 7 in the evening. The pizzas are good, a bit expensive but perhaps on average only as expensive as pizzas at other restaurants in Little Italy. 

The service however was very bad. Since there are always people waiting outside, the waiters seem to rush everything which we didn't like. If you're comfortable with in-and-out burger style eating then this joint might be your thing. This also means that the waiting time between  you asking for the bill and waiter bringing it to you could be anywhere between 15-20 minutes.

The other negative point about Pizzeria Napoletana is their seating arrangement. Their dining rooms (yes they have more than one dining room, 2 1/2 in fact) can look and feel very crowded at times because there's hardly any place to move between tables and chairs. You could easily listen to what people around you are talking about without wanting to eavesdrop (and people did tend to speak louder in this restaurant than in any other restaurant I've been to, I don't know the reason though).

Once again the pizzas are ok but the service and ambiance leave a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Don't get intimidated with the menu that reads like study notes of an Art History major - There's 41 pizzas, and 33 pasta dishes, it might be a bit daunting to make a decision. I encourage you to explore the menu and pick different dishes, and share with the rest of your table. Family style eating is always a great way to go especially from this family run joint that's been around for 64 years."}
{"text":"Wanted to eat at this restaurant because it had been featured on the Food Network show \"You Gotta Eat Here\"  Let me tell you, you really Don't Gotta Eat Here.  The best part is that it is a BYOB.  The pasta was very good, so no complaints there, but the pizza was NOT impressive at all.  

At a price of $19.00 for a very thin crust with basically no toppings at all, it was very over-priced. We ordered the #37 \"Latina\"
(mozzarella, tomato sauce, italian sausage, onions, green peppers, jalapenos).  First off, \"where's the cheese\"!  I was able to count the sausage on the pizza which resulted to about 8 small pieces.  the green peppers we cut into tiny 3mm x 3mm square pieces (how un-italian), as were the onions.  I have honestly had better frozen pizza from the grocery store. It would not hurt them financially at all if they used more toppings on their pizzas. 
 
This is an insult to me because I feel as though the owners are quite frankly laughing in the customer's faces as we pay for our meals. I like to get my money's worth and I don't like to be taken as a fool.  I strongly feel that the popularity that they gained by being on a television show has been over-abused.  

The service was also terrible, so i did not feel any remorse leaving a tip of about $2.00 on a $42.00 bill.  The waiter basically opened my bottle of wine but did not pour it into my glass.  He brought the bread basket with my serving plates underneath and just left it for me to place them.  I separated and served myself the pizza.  Not a smile was offered by my waiter, almost like I was a nuisance to him.  Did not see my waiter or any other waiter come back to my table to inquire if everything was to my liking.  

Sorry but very over-rated.  If you want this caliber of pizza just visit your local grocery store.  By the way, the grocery store accepts all major credit cards."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in Montreal so far. True that pizza is not Montreal's speciality, but these ones are truly Italian. Is not a fancy place, though."}
{"text":"Quoi de mieux qu'un bon resto italien sans prétention, sans artifice... Simplement bon. J'y retourne souvent!!!! Ca vaut le détour, vraiment!"}
{"text":"Très moyen ,pour ne pas dire décevant,si vous aimez la pizza congelé style Mc cain alors vous êtes à la bonne place,sans parler du service."}
{"text":"I don't think I really need to post a review about this place but just in case you've never been let me tell you, boy are you missing out!! As a European I can guarantee you that this is some of the most authentic pizza I've ever had, may even be better than some of the ones in Europe.  Not to mention when you're eating here on a Sunday for lunch and you're surrounded by Italian families you know the food is authentic."}
{"text":"I visited Pizzeria Napoletana during the 2012 August Italian week.  We were packed like sardines but what can I say about their pizza?  This is what pizza is supposed taste like! Even though I'm not Italian I would say that this is what home made pizza should taste like, not Pizza Hut, Domino's...

I will definitely go back accept this time not during an Italian festival!

Ciao!"}
{"text":"Forget this place !
the people who like this kind of pizza probably never tryed the real pizza from other place than Napoli (italy).
Just tomato sauce on it and nothing more...
Quattro formagggi and i was searching the cheese on my pizza so trust me, try something other.
Also, it's not even wood oven which is the most for make good pizza.
No credit or debit card, just cash and nobody care about you...
Just one things is bring your wine but for eat like that better to stay home..."}
{"text":"Good pizza (especially sauce & crust) but not for the price. We had a nice time on the patio."}
{"text":"Best pizza coal pizza in Miami i went there 4 times in the last 2 weeks good service good portions and reasonable prices 
When I spend my vacation in Miami i always visite that place . Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I come here every few months with my friends and I'm dazzled by the food every single time. The food is... AMAZING.

This is a typical Italian pizza and pasta restaurant that has a \"cafeteria\" style décor (which I love). The place is usually full and a line-up is normal.... It doesn't take that long for us to get a table, and the wait is so worth it. 

I would suggest you split a pizza and pasta dish with a friend as there is so much on the menu that is divine. 

Please note, this is a BYOB and they only take cash. 

I strongly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"The best pizza I've taste since my latest trip to Italy.I guess it gives you a idea how good its was. I had the Caprina pizza, the pizza crust was just perfect. The perfect place eand area to have lunch with friends or just a simple take out. Very good price value."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Little Italy and maybe even all of Montreal. If your visiting Montreal this is definitely a place you need to check out!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in town!!  So many choices and so many possibilities to satisfy the picky eaters.  Personally I prefer my pizza nice and simple (Vegetarian style).  Don't forget to bring your wine.  The ambiance is fun and the service is very friendly.  Don't forget to try out the Salsiccia alla Rocco.  

I did not try their pasta but I am sure you cannot go wrong.  I believe that Pizza Napoletana and Pizza Focolaio are the best Pizza places in Montreal in that order."}
{"text":"Terrible service just trying to call and make a reservation. The lady on the phone told my husband that they can only take reservations for 6 people and up, and when I called, said only 8ppl and up. She also hung up on us twice. Would never go there."}
{"text":"I've heard about the pizza at this place and have always wanted to try it. Saw it on a show on the Food Network a few years ago but never got around to going. Finally got to try it this past Saturday when we were in the neighborhood. After having a bad experience at another restaurant (see review for La table du Pecheur) we decided to pick up a few pizzas for the ride back to the South Shore. I couldn't believe how many people were waiting outside for a table on a Saturday at 8pm. Luckily for us, we were taking it to go. Two of us walked inside and it was like a mad house in there. It was small and packed full. There was no one at the counter so we waited a few minutes then finally flagged down one of the waiters running around to ask who we could order with. A woman came out of the kitchen and gave us no greeting or anything. Just a \"yes?\" very rudely. I said take out and she pointed to the menus. Since I have never been there, I just said a large pepperoni. She rudely said \"we only have one size\" so I said ok just 2 pepperonis and one all dressed. She said rudely again, \"what number?\" At this point I just wanted to leave but we were hungry and it was already late. So I patiently found the correct number and gave her the orders. She gave us the total and I took out my bank card. She said rudely \"cash only. We have an ATM but it's broken. One down the street\" we called our friend who was waiting outside and he brought us some cash. We paid and she said \"come back in 15-20 minutes\" we left and sent our friends to go pick up the pizza cause I didn't want to deal with that rude B*%#* again. 

Pizza was ok. I've had better. Found out later that night after rewatching  the episode on YouTube that the rude B*%^# was the freakin owner, Linda. Why people go there, I'll never know."}

{"text":"You remember that scene in Sopranos when Toni and Paulie go to Italy, so excited for the Italian food?  But once they are there, everything on the menu seems foreign to Paulie?  This is what I imagine some Italians must feel after coming to this pizza joint. 

It is a cute restaurant located in Little Italy, and there are usually lines outside.  It has a family run feel, and has been there since 1948.  There are plenty of selection of both pizzas and pastas.  We sampled both pizzas and pastas, and didn't feel like either were exceptional in any way.  The pizza crust tasted store bought, and the pasta was bland and creamy.  It wasn't what I was hoping for, but maybe that is because everyone has told me that the best pizza in Montreal is found here, and I guess I was a lot disappointed.  And the house-made tiramisu was so wrong, we couldn't even finish it.  

It is a very family friendly spot, and the service felt uneven.  One other thing, you should BYOW, which again made me feel very very far away from Italy."}
{"text":"Note: we went on labour day, so the restaurant was super super busy.

I wouldn't call this the best pizza in town, but certainly a good one. We ordered the  Donatella and Tutta Bella. TB was fantastic, Donatella was nothing to write home about. We also shared the Romana pasta, which was well \"al dente\", sauce and ingredients were good. Service was edgy with mistakes here and there, but hats off despite the fact given it was a very busy night."}
{"text":"On était pas encore à Montréal qu'on en entendait parler .. Napoletana par ci, Napoletana par là ... 
Et finalement c'est la déception qui l'emporte .. Salle EXTRÊMEMENT bruyante, pizzas plus que moyennes ; nous ne retournerons certainement pas à la \"meilleure pizzeria\" de Montréal ! A bon entendeur,"}
{"text":"Food was great, there's no denial here! Can't say the same about the service though... All male crew serving you, saw some nice ones but also some old men fed up with their job. Our server completely ignored us when we tried to get his attention a couple times. We had to go get our own water and bread... I'd still give it a try if you've never been, the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"So disappointing... Industrial crust, ordinary toppings. There is so much better in Montreal. Try Magpie instead!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza and hearty pasta dishes, in the heart of Montreal's quaint Little Italy district. My advice is to keep the toppings down to a bare minimum since the crust cannot support too many extras. Basic  interior without much in the way of design or features, much like a traditional 1950's Boston or New York pizza joint, very noisey and crowded when busy. I had a simple Margerita Pizza for $8.95 which had a thin crunchy crust and unlike all other pizzerias in Montreal they put the cheese UNDER the sauce!. Fettucini Alfredo was rather creamy and portion size was larger than expected. Service is not particularly attentive and the 2 indoor dining rooms and outdoor terrace both get packed at both lunch and dinner times, so show up in the mid to late afternoon for a better experience without the need to wait on any lines. You can bring your own wine and beer. Skip desserts here, and if you dining during the summertime, instead head over to the nearby Alati-Caserta bakery a block away on 277 Rue Dante for their homemade ice cold lemon granita."}
{"text":"Lieu qui convient tout à fait pour des soirées de groupe, anniversaire ou autre, car grandes tables et spacieux. Mais cela devient très bruyant aussi!
Décoration très italienne ! Couleurs et tableaux vous mettent dans l'ambiance!

Pour ce qui est du repas. Beaucoup de choix dans les pizzas et pâtes !! Pour les amateurs de cuisine italienne vous allez avoir du choix!! La pâte est extra fine !

Je ne le mettra pas dans le meilleur des italiens... ont été 10 ce soir là. Et unanimement il en est ressorti que c'était bon mais rien de bien exceptionnel non plus... Les pizzas vont de 12$ à 17$ environ et les pâtes pareils. 

Je vous déconseille fortement les desserts !! Aucunement fait maison !!!
Les profiteroles sont des surgelés, la crème brûlée goûtait plus la feta que les ouefs et le tiramisu à éviter!

Pour 2 taxes et service inclu, environ 50$ pour une pizza et des tortellini et un dessert chacun.

C'est un apporté votre vin donc parfait pour vos soirées de groupe!

Bref, restez sur les pâtes ou pizza! Et allez y en groupe surtout pas en couple!"}
{"text":"Qualité mediocre par rapport au prix....pate congele...ingredients presque inexistants....bref c'est l'austérité chez Napolitana"}

{"text":"I thought I was going to write an update & was surprised that I'd never written an initial review. It's super casual family resto. I've been to many times and the food never disappoints.

My most recent visit I had the Insalata Napoletana, my usual is the Insalata di Parma but I felt like changing it up.

My friend had the Cannelloni which she totally loved. She commented on how she could imagine a Nanna in the kitchen making the pasta. Fresh & yummy!"}
{"text":"I have the chance to live in this area. I tried many pizzerias and I always come back to this one. I love their classic Margarita with imported Italian cheese (#33), the thin crust and their salads for a great start. Quality is consistent and the place always crowded. They just opened a little boutique in front for people to wait and buy wine. This is brilliant ! I ordered last Friday, my order was ready quickly and I love to skip the line to get my pizzas while people wait ;) I went to their boutique to check the wine prices, it seems fair (under 20$), some are organic or nature, which is a must for this kind of place, to offer something different from SAQ.

Cons: you have to wait to go there on busy days and bring cash."}
{"text":"Ran out of desserts! Pizza is awful, lasagna had chopped up left over ham in it - gross! Our server left to go home halfway through the meal. Lastly they have massive TVs playing their food channel appearance where they cook things not on the menu. Don't believe the hype- it's cheap and being your own wine the rest is subpar slop."}
{"text":"Overall a good spot. 

Ambiance: Really great for long dinners (we spent about two hours there), so it's perfect for family and friend get togethers. Not the best for a date, since the ambiance is less romantic and more loud with all the people they can fit in that place. Definitely has a familiar, big Italian family vibe. We went on a Monday mid-August, and were able to get a table for 6 on the sidewalk, but there were 15 people waiting outside when we left at 8, so if you want to sit outside, get there early or be 2-4 people. In the winter avoid sitting in the seating area close to the door - it can get chilly, especially with people waiting and going in and out.

Food: Decent. Not my favorite pizza but it's certainly yummy. Their antipasto and pasta dishes are maybe even better than the pizza. The fact that it is byow means that this restaurant have good value for money.

Service: they let you take your time, so don't show up starving. I asked someone who brought us our food to please get us some spicy oil, he said \"sure\" but then never returned. Oh well! Everyone who works there is clearly very busy, so if you like being left to your conversation this is a good thing. We found the service fine.

Overall: this place is very popular. Best for early dinners unless you don't mind waiting. Open late-ish. Good for a group. Best part was getting seated outside. We will be back I'm sure!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was suggested to us by a Canadian-Italian family friend (as to confirm that Italians too eat there, not only Italian food-loving tourists) and it's been a favourite ever since. We stopped eating pizza anywhere else. This restaurant can (and usually will be) loud and packed every night of the week but you can always get a seat within a reasonable time. The atmosphere, staff and food is authentically Italian and you can tell, and taste, that they don't buy their products at IGA or Metro, but more likely at nearby Milano. The choice of pizzas can be overwhelming at first but over time you'll come to have your favourites. The margarita is a good one to start with."}
{"text":"Worth the 20 minute wait just for the desserts . Cash only but they have a atm on  site ."}
{"text":"Beau, Bon, Maison !

pas cher ! apportez votre vin ! La carte de pâtes faites maison et de pizza four a bois marie bien le menu classique italien et autres fantaisies du chef. Les entrées sont généreuses, le service est rapide et serviable.

Ambiance bruyante et le décor est plus ou moins élaboré, mais bon, c'est pas pour ça qu'on est la !

Rien à redire, un des meilleurs endroits de la petite italie à mon avis !

{"text":"This joint has been opened since 1948 and, to my great shame, I must say that in my 47 years of existence, I had not been there until this past Tuesday, including the 27 years I lived in Montreal. 
While, in my opinion, Pizzeria Libretto rules the roost in Toronto for authentic Neapolitan pizza, it still gives out a few concessions to hipsterism ( here's looking at you, duck confit on a pizza!). Napoletana does no such thing. If it's not on a pizza in Naples, you can bet your sweet bippy that it won't be on a pizza here!
Pizzas come in one size. The menu is overwhelming: 41 pizzas, 34 pastas, antipasti, desserts. No mains though. This is a pizzeria, not a formal restaurant. it is cash only and they have an Instacash one-armed bandit in the place if you are running out. It is stricly BYOW, which means you  can go vhe nearby SAQ , get a wonderful bottle of Ripasso like we did and avoid restaurant wine prices (which we sure did!).

We had  pizza. A Rustica (Mozzarella, Bocconcini, sliced tomatoes and pancetta) and a primavera (Mozzarella, tomato sauce, anchovies, clams, black olives, artichoke hearts and mushrooms). The crust is perfect , toppings are plenty. If you have a pizza avoid having anything else before unless you share. Portions are very good.
For dessert, we shared a cassatina ( almond paste, cake, mascarpone cream, a cherry on top, looks like a boob but delicious nevertheless! With one cappucino, the damage was $46.27.
The room is basic with  traditional italian artifacts on the walls, as well as some tvs (ideal for the NHL playoffs). The clientele is mixed, singles, couples, families but they all have one common denominator: a love for great pizza. 
When you go to Montreal and crave for pizza, Napoletana is a must!"}
{"text":"Very laid back at the corner of Dante street, in the heart of little Italy. We came here on a nice summer evening. It's BOB, so we picked up a bottle of wine from the depaneur across the street. We sat outside on the Terasse and enjoyed every moment. How can you go wrong? Pizza, pasta, wine, in the heart of little Italy. Good vibe and no complaints with the food. Pizza's are thin crust."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a casual lunch/dinner in Little Italy, this is the perfect place to go to! This pizzeria sells thin crusted pizza cooked to the right amount of crunchiness. In my opinion, I would have wanted the crust to be a bit more chewier; it was a bit too dry for me. I got a pizza with pancetta, sliced tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella. The sliced tomatoes and cheese tasted so good!! The cheese was in strings when you took a bite of the pizza. They also give you a bread basket as you are waiting for your order. The price was decent, but I would have gone to a different pizzeria and got better pizza at the same price. Their pizza prices range from ($15-$18). My friend ordered the spaghetti with just tomato sauce and she said it was very bland. So I suggest staying away from it. Service was ok. When we tried to order, we had our raised up for a while even though a bunch of waiters obviously saw us with our hands up. If you're in the area, by all means go. If you aren't, do more research and find a different pizzeria to go to. 

THEY ONLY TAKE CASH!! They have an ATM inside. They also let you take out your leftovers!"}
{"text":"This is BYOB family style restaurant. Its extremely loud, the service is basic as is the food. This is NOT an authentic Italian restaurant. All their pasta plates including their pizza has way too much tomato sauce. Their oil and garlic is although quite tasty. If you're looking for a place to bring your annoying kids and family this is the place. However, for some reason this place has become a Montreal institution. It's always full, they don't take credit cards and as I said earlier its so noisy you just can't wait to gulp down your food and leave. Really the only thing good about this restaurant is the price. In fact the pricing was 15% better prior to the government imposition of mandatory invoicing. That is, the pricing was tax in whereas now it's plus tax. Great business model when it's cash only eh!!!!I recommend you bring your favorite wine or one or two steps above so you can have something nice to say at the end. Go once when you don't feel like cooking. 2 pizzas will cost you $25. Oh and by the way never take home uneaten pizza as it tastes and looks like card board the day after."}
{"text":"Very good food for a decent price. I've tried many of the pastas and pizzas and they were all delicious. Only downside is you have to wait a long time for a table"}
{"text":"Awful. They serve thin frozen pizzas and the toppings are poor. Noisy and overcrowded place; escape if you want a real Italian pizza (source: Italian who has always loved pizzas and lived in Italy for 28 years)."}
{"text":"Very fun pizzeria.  Great in summer if you can get a place outside.  Bring your own wine makes this place a great deal.  Share a couple of pastas and pizzas to get a sampling of the menu"}
{"text":"I don't understand how a place this good and authentic and iconic doesn't take reservations, but they don't. I'm flabbergasted, but no matter what do, they will not reserve a table for you.

So you go early and line up outside and wait till a table frees up. Come in spring, summer or fall, I can't imagine waiting outside for a table in the cold, but I'm sure many have.

Once you're seated it's entirely possible they'll re-assign your table to someone else if you decide to go to the washroom before your meal! This happened to me, but the waiters did correct the error and seated the people who had been seated at my table elsewhere.

The menu is a swirling vortex of chaos. There's something like 80 types of pizza. And they also do pasta, though I never got around to that end of the menu. I'm overwhelmed by that vastness of choice. I prefer places that have like eight things on the menu. I feel like there's less chances I'll order the wrong thing.

Anyway the wood oven pizza is great, not too salty. Note that the big Parmesan cheese shaker on the table is in fact full of sugar. I managed to get quite a bit on to my pizza before realizing the errors of my ways.

Their desserts are nothing special though, I'd go to a bona-fide dessert place afterwards if you're gonna do the dessert thing.

All in all a good experience, might try the pasta next time."}
{"text":"I've been to Pizzeria Napoletana a couple times and the food quality is not consistent. Sometimes it's great, and sometimes it's meh. I definitely recommend ordering pizza over pasta. You'd think an Italian restaurant would master their pasta...but nope. It was a tasteless $17 dish. 

Also - don't go here if you want to have a good time drinking wine with friends - they will literally put a 2-hour timer on you and kick you out once the time is up."}
{"text":"Ok, I don't get why people say its great or the name. It is not Neapolitan style pizza. The base is like a cracker - I like charred but chewy and airy dough - especially for a Neapolitan style. Why is there so much sauce on the pizza, the ratios are just not right! This was very disappointing. BYOW, so I guess that was good."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been a family favourite for many years but recent visits have been disappointing.  The pasta sauce was sciupata (bland) and noodles overcooked.  Don't get the feeling that there are many Italians in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Decided to hit up this spot with the boo on a brisk Monday eve. First thing's first: there's a depanneur conveniently located across the street to pick up a bottle of wine. And believe me, you want to pick up that bottle of wine. Also, CASH ONLY (there is an ATM in the restaurant with a $1 fee I think). We arrived at a good time apparently, only waited for about 10 minutes or so for a table (as we were leaving the line looked much longer). The place was packed with families and couples on a romantic night out. There were TVs showing soccer games, a faux tree thing right in the middle of the room complete with fake leaves, and a replica of the Mona Lisa even. Tacky in a good way I suppose. Some red and white checkered tablecloths and Italian folk music would've sealed the deal. But really though, we were here for the food, and boy it didn't disappoint. From the extensive pizza and pasta menu we settled on the \"Rustica\" pizza with mozzarella, sliced tomatoes, bocconcini, and pancetta, and the Ravioli Biancoverde: meat-stuffed ravioli with cream, pesto and parmesan cheese. The ravioli was tasty, but maaaaaan the pizza was out of this world, arguably the best pizza I've had in Montreal up to this point. Our fresh-out-the-gym big-biceps beefcake server provided average service; apparently the \"bring your own wine\" also meant \"open and pour it your damn selves.\" But alas, the food earned this place their stars. Can't wait to come back for more pizza."}
{"text":"For Montreal, this is by far the most authentic naples-style pizza you can get. And for quite the decent price plus BYOB! Honestly, we are never disappointed, and take all our guests from out of town there, and we have never had any complaints, except from people who like deep-dish or thick crust nonsense. 

You may wind up waiting for quite some time, but at least everyone is cheery and you make some friends along the way... Efficient service, great food, no rush, and amazing deserts. Truly, a gem!"}
{"text":"PIZZA WAS AMAZING. I ordered the pizza #3 ( pepperoni ) but it's more like small slices of italian sausages. Also ordered tortellini must say that i wasn't a big fan but definitely will come back for that pizza. Delicious."}
{"text":"To say I'm a fan of Pizza would be like saying Cookie Monster is a fan of Cookies. That being said, I know the pizzas made at Pizzeria Napoletana aren't traditional neapolitan pizzas. 

But to be perfectly frank, if it tastes good, I'll gladly throw tradition out the window (or at least only keep it in mind when I go to Italy).

I opted for the Tutta bella and it was great. A nice crispy crust with a slight char on the bottom, sausage was a nice balance of salty and peppery, the mushrooms complemented nicely as a earthy component and of course the mozzarella and tomato sauce were on point.

As other have said, service is, for the lack of a better word, \"serviceable\" and really is the only reason I can't give the place a 5th star."}
{"text":"Never ended up eating there. I have no issues waiting in line when I see the place is busy. But when I see multiple tables empty for over 5 min and realize the lineup is just because the place is poorly managed: big red flag.....needless to say, I walked out. There are so many other good pizza places in lil' Italy anyway. I'd rather pay for good service. I guess that's always the compromise with a BYOW. Next suivant . Ciao"}
{"text":"This pizza was delicious! Thin and crispy crust, outstanding sauce and yummy toppings. I can't wait to try it again. Warning: peak hours are very busy, so you will have to wait. Try going off-peak. It will still be busy, but a short wait. 

Our server was extremely friendly and helpful. Got us set up at a table quickly with a stroller taking up a seat. Happy to speak English with me, which wasn't as common in Montreal as I would have guessed. Generally available when we needed something. 

I got the chocolate mousse for dessert. It was good but I would probably try something else next time. There was a wide variety of desserts available."}
{"text":"Meh. Average pizza, bad salads. Nothing special at all."}
{"text":"It's a little bit surprise to see this restaurant get great review. The pizza crust is very thin and the topping is so little even we requested to add mushroom on it. The spaghetti al pesto is disappointing."}
{"text":"Pour un vrai souper à l'italienne, avec le bruit inclut, vous ne serez pas déçu! Prix raisonnables et tous les plats sont excellents. Il y a plus de 20 ans que je viens ici et toujours le même goût typiquement italien. Si vous aimez les plats piquants, vous ne serez pas déçu de la sauce Al?´Arrabiata, selon mon conjoint, c'est la meilleur!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, good pasta, with a whole lot of varieties and flavours on the menu. It's a classic Little Italy spot that you should check out if you're looking for some comfort Italian food. Good experience overall"}
{"text":"Back to Pizzeria Napoletana, and I brought my dad to celebrate my Birthday lunch with my fiancé.

  Picked out a bottle of vino at the SAQ on St-Laurent just around the corner. Make sure you have Cash here. They do have an ATM in the back if you forget.

The waiters were friendlier this time, dont expect friendly.  I know they have a reputation for not caring, just busy working. They brought out menus, opened the wine bottle , and brought out Euro-Style Small glasses for the wine, great so you don't knock it over, and so the waiters can Stack the Glasses Sky-high like the Tower of Pisa when they clear the tables, amazing to watch.

We ordered the Antipasto della casa :  its prosciutto crudo, Bocconcini, roasted red peppers.  Really delicious the Bocconcini cheese (similar to buffalo mozzarella) was so fresh, it needed seasoning like salt or pepper or balsamic glaze, but it worked with the Prosciutto and roasted Red peppers (they tasted like sundried tomatoes dehydrated and salty), they combined into a delicious party in your mouth. 
This Antipasto was designed for 1, not so much to share.

Choose from 34 pizzas and 31 varieties of pasta dishes. 
We chose the no.9 Arrabbiata Pizza : mozzarella,  tomato sauce, olives, anchovies, Hot Peppers.  I love the thin crispy crust it just works with anything. I found the pizza to be salty, but that's what anchovies are. My dad really enjoyed this pizza, he also ate it with the bread rolls they complimentary brought out .

Also ordered the no.25 Genovese : its Pesto,  Smoked Turkey, marinated hot peppers, mozzarella, parmesan, sliced tomates .  Wow! My Favourite I'm loving this pizza soo much I wish we ordered two!    Again crispy thin perfection crust, smokey Turkey flav,  delicious mozzarella, tasty Parmesan, a little bite with the pepper rings and delicate tomato slices to finish it off.  Yumm.  *see pics*

My dad ordered an espresso Alongé and was happy.

I stared at the Pastry Display case as we made our way out of the Restaurant, Tiramisu, Cannolis,  Millefeuilles, Profiteroles, wiped the drool away and left happy cause I had an awesome Pizza.

\"Try something from \"You Gotta Eat Here!\" The Donatella, O'Sole Mio, Mafaldine Casarecce, or Polpette di Angelina\" **"}
{"text":"L'équipe est bien agréable et le restaurant est grand mais les pizzas ne sont malheureusement pas à la hauteur. Je regrette d'avoir choisi ce lieux pour y emmener 12amis. Les patte ne semblent pas de bonne qualitée pour une pizzeria italienne. 
Le petit plus c'est apportez votre vin !!"}
{"text":"Pasta portions are generous, pizzas are good (yay thin crust!) and varied choices of antipasti (Including imported mozzarella di Bufala! I was instantly transported back to my memories of last summer in Italy). The number of choices for both pizzas and pastas is staggering. I think I spent a good 15 minutes just debating what I should order, because frankly, everything sounded delicious. 

The place has a very warm and casual atmosphere: it strikes me as the perfect place to get together with friends and family. Go early, or make a reservation if you can, because it was very crowded when we left at 7 (on a Tuesday night!) The service was prompt and courteous, which is frankly remarkable considering how swamped the waiters looked. 

All in all, I can see there's good reasons this place is considered an institution in Little Italy!"}
{"text":"Ordinary pizza - very ordinary 
I was really disappointed 
Only good point: bring your own wine"}
{"text":"Great pizza if you enjoy thin crust!!!!! Light and not too greasy so it's perfect if you don't want a heavy meal. I enjoyed so much I got a frozen pizza to go :-)"}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good....a little difficult to cut after you've had some wine maybe, but that was a personal decision. Yes, like others have mentioned the service isn't great - in fact it may be non-existent. I know it's a BYOB but is it hard to ask if a table would like their bottle opened? Offer more glasses? Check if there are condiments on the table and how the food is? The QPR suffers here: the prosciutto, arugula, and other toppings on my Toscana pizza were good. However, I'm not sure if it merits a $18 price tag. Maybe that is the issue, the pizza was good...but not great. Maybe it would have seemed great if there was more attention paid to the customer's experience. In the end all I can say is that it was slightly disappointing. Would I come back again? I'm undecided.
Pro-tip: Do not order a pizza with greens on top if you've been drinking on an empty stomach. They will go everywhere."}
{"text":"We went this place yesterday ...was a really horrible experience these guys rip you off the food quality was so bad &  the quantity was too little for  the money they changed...it was so much overly priced on the top the host was so rude.. asked only cash when we don't have Canadian Dollars they took US dollars ..which is more value ...on the top the lady on the counter was really rude...calling us cheap where ever these people ripping off the customers...I don't recommend anyone to go this horrible place"}
{"text":"Good solid spot gets 3/5 cause the terrace is nice and its BYOB. The pizza however is nothing to write home to mama about."}
{"text":"There is some great pizza here.   I spent a week here as a tourist and this is probably the place the felt the least touristy and most like just a regular place in a nice neighborhood.

This is a cash-only place.  I think this is more common in Canada, because I ran into that three times in a week and haven't had that happen three times in my life in the US.  I had some cash anyhow, but they do have an ATM.

It did appear to be BYOB.  I'm not much of a drinker so I don't mind."}
{"text":"Déception pour moi quant à mon passage à la Pizzeria Napoletana.

Je me faisais une joie de manger une bonne pizza dans la petite Italie et j'avoue que cela n'a pas été a la hauteur de mon attente.

Tout d'abord le cadre, comme déjà dit fait plutôt cantine tout comme le service, très expéditif.
Par contre je trouve plutôt sympa de pouvoir apporter sa propre bouteille de vin. (à noter qu'un SAQ se trouve à quelques minutes sur le Boulevard Saint Laurent).

Soit je suis là avant tout pour les pizza, je me suis donc laissé tenter par une Campagnola et j'ai été déçu.
Je n'ai pas vraiment réussi à retrouver le goût de la saucisse style pepperoni, tout comme les champignons. La pâte quand à elle n'était pas non plus transcendante. 

Bref à retenter pour les pastas mais pour l'instant la Pizzeria Napoletana ne m'a pas franchement convaincu."}
{"text":"Here's how I judge my pizzas. Dont matter is it's thin or thick crust as long as it's crispy and still slightly doughy on the inside. The crust must be solid enough to hold the cheese and doesn't get soggy underneath. Every slice must have equal amounts of toppings on each slice, I hate getting a slice with no or very little green peppers or mushrooms on it if it's an all dressed!  Final test is biting into the pizza and everything remains in tact and the cheese or topping doesn't just slide off.

I dont understand the hype for this place. its okay pizza, I don't hate it but its nothing to rave about. If a location is suppose to be known as the best of something, BE THE BEST AT IT. unfortunately I don't believe that Napoletana lived up to the expectations and I will not be returning anytime soon"}
{"text":"Good service and the place looks very old fashioned inside which I love. We walked 5 miles and I was looking for something tasty so someone recommended it. I ordered the salmon salad it was so delicious and out of this world because of the dressing. We also got the antipasto di Casa which was good and the fresh mozzarella was delicious and the sundries tomatoes . My friend ordered the ravioli biancoverde. It wasn't too heavy but just delicious.we would definitely come back here. The air conditioning in the place was awesome where as most places don't turn it on lol"}
{"text":"This place was unreal. Make sure you bring cash and ear plugs. Hope you're dining alone because it's nearly impossible to have a conversation and good luck finding your server. Never again!"}
{"text":"This was the worst restaurant I have been to in years!! I rarely do reviews but this particular restaurant deserves it. After seeing this on food network, we decided to try it. When we arrived we were rushed to sit down and order, we had brought a bottle of wine and wanted to relax and enjoy a glass of wine. The server who didnt even look us in the eyes once, quickly brought stale hard bread and rushed our orders. My partner took the lasagna and i took the tortellinis, it literaly took 2,5 minutes and we got our meals! We didnt even start eating the bread! And dont get me wrong, usually  rapitity in this industry is a great thing but this was way to rushed, almost like if it was microwaved pasta! For the meals itself, my tortellinis were to be honest, tasted like shit and my partners lasagna wasnt consistent at all, a slurpy , salty sauce. 
8,5 minutes later he quickly picked up our plates and rushed us the bill and obviously they dont take credit or Interac! It's fucking 2015! Get a free square if you cant afford anything else!  After waiting about ten minutes at the table we get up and the waiter tells us we need to pay up front! Thank you sir for not saying anything! Oh and by the way they dont even have ice !LOL I really dont recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My friend insisted to go there, claiming it was one of the best spots for pizza in little Italy. I never go in that area so I trusted her on this one. 

There was a line-up. I asked for a table for two and they told me I would have to wait 15-20 minutes. I immediately went outside and they called me 5 minutes later. 

It is incredibly loud in there. There was a World Cup match on T.V. but I doubt it's very different when there isn't. Italy wasn't playing. Towards the end we were pretty much yelling at each other and I deeply hate that. 

This is a BYOW and cash only. I think I saw 15 people using the ATM machine while we were eating. 

As for the food, they have an interesting selection of pizzas: vegetarian or not. I had the Tutta bella: sausages and mushrooms. It was okay, even better with the spicy oil. 

We also ordered garlic bread and that was not so good. It was basically a little dipped in garlic butter. Difficult to eat and let's face it, not very appetizing. 

Overall, it was acceptable but I just wanted to leave as quickly as possible due to the noise. Will I go back? Absolutely not."}
{"text":"Maybe the best at what they do! 

Fantastic thin crust pizzas. OMG. I ate there for lunch, I'm still full, yet I'm craving more. I'm out of control!

Now if this wasn't enough... It's bring your own wine. BYOW! 

Friendly staff. Fast service."}
{"text":"Basic perfectly decent quick italian-ish food. Authentic? Nope. But good enough to do the trick. Seems to be a family joint. Lot of crying babies when I was there. Comment si dice \"earplugs\"?"}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Italian places outside Italy with phenomenal pasta! Very casual and could probably pull off a cooler space."}
{"text":"I'm giving Pizza Napoletana a 4 stars, why?

That's because their pizza and pasta are good. Furthermore, it's a bring your own wine.

Don't expect good service, you go there for the food and value.

Every time I come here, I come relaxed because I know what I'm paying for!"}
{"text":"Our second stop for Pizza Week in Montreal, Pizzeria Napoletana did not disappoint. Unfortunately we were feeling a bit too full prior to even being seated. I wish we had more of an appetite to enjoy their delicious pizzas! 

The list of pizzas to choose from is vast. It's basically ever combination of toppings possible. I stuck a simpler choice - #5 from the menu which included artichokes. They bring out this spicy oil to drizzle over anything you order. I NEED to find out how to remake it, it was THAT good."}
{"text":"I went here during a recent weekend trip to Montreal.  While the restaurant is billed as \"authentically Italian\", in my opinion, it's far more Italian-American than traditional Italian fare (fine, if that's your thing).  Reminds me of the \"red sauce\" Italian places you find commonly in NYC.

First up was a mozzarella di buffala with tomatoes and basil - a simple, classic dish that I love to make at home.  The dish was edible but the cheese was too firm, the olive oil was thin and watery and finally the basil was chopped too finely to be tasted.

Two pizzas were up for dinner, the Toscana with prosciutto, arugula and diced tomatoes and the \"chef's special\" with Italian sausage, rapini and parmigiano.  The first was fresh and tasty but a little uneventful.  The second was loaded with a cheap, salty parmigiano cheese that overwhelmed the flavours of the other ingredients.

The bring-your-own-wine, cash-only bit is a bit downscale given the prices. The servers are all in a tremendous rush to keep the food coming which makes it a difficult place to relax.  Great place to bring the kids since it's noisy and bustling though.  Given the chance, I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Getting old ! There are plenty of solid alternatives for pizza in montreal so one must constantly be on top his game in order to remain relevant. Service also requires a review and basic pleasantries are lacking here. I give it 2 stars as I have had good pizza here in yester years and I hope this place can turn it around."}
{"text":"Quoi manger un soir de semaine vers 22h! L'endroit était plein... Assez bruyant mais la pizza est bonne. J'y allais il y a 15 ans et c'est encore bon maintenant. Service ordinaire cependant!"}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant de pizzas et de pâtes. J'y suis allé des dizaines de fois, car j'habite proche et c'est toujours bon. La pizza comme les pâtes, vous trouverez votre préféré. Certaines pizzas peuvent être cher payé pour ce qu'il y a dessus. Certains de mes amis trouve que c'est un peu cher pour finalement manger de la pâte! Mais c'est un apporter votre vin. Pas de réservation possible et c'est souvent plein. Le mieux c'est de prendre pour apporter!"}
{"text":"Maybe one day I will understand why everyone likes this spot. Until then, I will continue to dislike their bland cardboard thin rock hard crusted pizzas with barely any toppings or cheese on them the lack of a debit card machine \"they convinently direct you to the atm machine which has a fee to withdraw money\" because they are too cool to own a debit machine, the rude and rushed waiters who have no patience or your unused buns which get convinently tossed back in the bread bag sitting on the floor near the kitchen swinging door Enjoy."}
{"text":"Je viens ici depuis 30 ans. Un bon resto italien, pâte et pizza, sans prétention à bon prix. Apportez votre vin!"}
{"text":"Non capisco come possiamo chiamare ste \"pizze\" napoletane ! Napoli sta piangendo."}
{"text":"I've been to Napoletana twice now which clearly means its worth visiting more than once. 

My first visit was a Saturday afternoon and we waited no time getting seated- however, the three of us had to share a table on both sides with two different parties. I'm never a big fan of this. 

The hostess was sweet and so was the guy who brought us out out water but when the salt-and-pepper haired guy came out I asked him what size the pizzas were (all one size) he looked at me as if I was stupid until he eventually pointed outside.  I asked him again (at this point annoyed) and he again pointed outside. Given that I didn't see any pizza outside I asked what he was pointing at and he finally huffed and said the pizzas were the size of the empty plate I was supposed to be looking. All that when he could of just said 10 inches... All the pizzas are about 10 inches people. 

My partner and I ordered the classic mozzarella and pepperoni and a fettuccini alfredo to share... The pizza was incredibly flavourful. The crust was crispy until the last bite and the mozzarella and sauce really went far beyond a regular pizza shop. The fettuccini was perfectly al dente and the sauce was sheer comfort. 

Overall we were really happy with the food. about $40 for the both of us and very regrettably cash only so we had to withdraw from the ATM there.

I came back today during lunch (Sunday) and put our names on the list to be seated. We were five people this time and the host quoted us 10 minutes. We waited a couple minutes short of 40 minutes but at least got our own table this time. The staff was super friendly and patient with us. I passed on the pasta and ordered myself the \"Rustica\" pizza and waited anxiously. The crust was, again, unbeatable but the pancetta was insanely salty which made it uneatable.  I picked it all off and still couldn't eat the parts of the pizza that had had the pancetta. I was all in all disappointed and still forced to withdraw money from their cash cow ATM. 

I haven't given up on this place and I'm sure ill be back. Their dessert menu looks really tempting (Nutella cheesecake?). This place has open 50+ years so I know they're doing something right and that my review isn't gonna make them or break them so I'm gonna give them their fair shot!"}
{"text":"Great pizza with many other selections I want to come back to try.  Service was a little slow, but I came in for lunch at 2:30 so I wasn't expecting much.  

BYOW, so come prepared."}
{"text":"45 minutes d attente, au lieu des 20 annoncees, pour être en terrasse, la salle étant vraiment trop bruyante, ça.commencait mal... \"Les meilleures pizzas de Montréal\", bon, ca valait surement le coup d attendre. Et bien non... La pizza du chef n'avait aucun interet tout comme les pates d un de mes amis, noyés dans une sauce grasse insipide... une addition elevee m'a convaincu de me mettre que deux étoiles, le seul intérêt étant la terrasse, agréable. Bref, une adresse à éviter, pour qui aime un tant soit peu la cuisine italienne!"}
{"text":"This place used to be a Montreal landmark.
The pizza here WAS the best in the city.
I'm very sad to say that it's lost it completely.
The pizza is really really lacking . Last night I ordered the buffala pizza. Very simple pizza - tomato sauce, mozzarella di buffala and basil. On the whole pizza I had maybe 4 slices of mozzarella. And 4 leaves of basil, all unevenly spread out. Not only that, i swear I feel like they mix tomato sauce and paste from a can and use that as their pizza sauce. The gnocchi was the biggest disappointment. Again the same tomato sauce.
Real shame to see this family restaurant and Montreal landmark go down the gutter."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty solid cant complain about the taste. Not sure what all the hype is all about, it was like any other thin crust pizza. The prices are fairly reasonable. 

I ordered the 'Marechiara' with mushrooms, mozzarella, tomato sauce and olives. The olive were not pitted which i found annoying. The service here was great! Be weary of the long wait and they only accept cash."}
{"text":"Delicious food tucked away by Parc Dante since 1948. The service can be slow when the joint is packed, but I love to see it full of families, and last night full of friends. I loved the rapini and sausage pasta so much I took my leftovers home even though they were kinda debate-ably small for such a request. I've enjoyed the pizzas and antipasto here before and would highly recommend it except I'd love to remain able to get a table, so let me clarify: this won't do for fancy work lunches, or dinner, or fancy anything. And it's clattery loud with laughter and talk, not date night ideal. The TVs seem totally out of place and annoying to me, but then I am not a sports fan, so I see no need to broadcast anything while eating. The patio is romantic by the park... but forget I mentioned it!"}
{"text":"I love the Pasta here, and the Pizza too. The owners are really Italian, and its not the typical Italian restaurant, It is kid friendly, and it is higher paced then most Pizzerias.
THIS IS NOT PIZZA HUT. and should not be compared to Italo-American Standards.

Pizzeria has been has been in business for over 50 years. They must be doing something right. Don't go here to expect a romantic evening, it's quite small, and always busy."}
{"text":"So, this place claims to be the best pizza in town and living here for 10 months and being a pizza enthusiast I have tried a lot! First off if you decide to go I world recommend a reservation or showing up an half hour before you're viciously hungry because there will  be a wait. 

But I do believe  the wait  is well worth it. The pizzas are truly delicious. I would recommend you get a pizza, and your pal get a pasta and you share them both since the pastas are very, very good as well! 

It's BYOB which I love, so Make sure to stop buy a SAC and bring a good bottle."}
{"text":"Below-average pizza with rude hosts and plus, you can only pay cash! Over-hyped at best! Before you dismiss this as a customer having a bad day: We ordered a napolitana that was salty to the point of inedible (my poor mom stayed polite though). We also ordered a gnocchi a la bolognasa, which turned out to be the most horrific pasta I have ever tasted. Gnocchis boiled in saltless water (tasteless then) and with salt sprinkled on them. The gnocchis shattered as I approached them with the fork. The bolognase smelled like pork while the hosts insisted it was pure beef. Don't waste your time here. There are plenty of good Italians in that neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I have to admit the pizza is great, the pasta is amazing but the portions are a little small and they only accept cash. This is the only reason for a 4 star rating instead of a five. The vibe in the restaurant is really relaxing and family oriented. The waiters are very personable and it seem like anytime you make eye contact with one they have a smile and are willing to share a joke with you. Lovely atmosphere, true Montreal feel and nice outdoor terrace (when the weather permits).  I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Pizza napoletana was great! I ordered a prosciutto pizza, which came on their signature thin crust with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. My only critique would be to add the prosciutto after it's done cooking so that the delicate coldcut doesn't turn into a slab of ham. I prefer my prosciutto uncooked, but all in all it was still a great pizza. I also got to try the four cheese pizza, and that was spot on. 

This place is great for someone on a budget. Prices vary enough that you can have a fantastic meal for under $15, which is a steal for the quality of ingredients. The byob makes this place golden.

While I prefer bottega's pizza crust a little bit more (it's gotta be those burn marks), I'll still be back to napoletana for sure. It's got a good location to offer, killer sauce, and an ambiance that can't be beat. Deserves the hype."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for a while and today was the day I had to try it out!  Let me preface my experience by explaining that I had arrived here @ 11:40 AM on a Sunday and the place didn't open till noon.  Okay, I was a little annoyed as I wanted to order my food and head home.  Patiently waiting, I went in to see if they would open early as there was 4 - 5 guys getting the place ready.  11:50 AM...door was unlocked but the guy at front said \"we open in 10 min\"!  As I waited one couple came by me, then another, then another couple.  To me this is a good sign!  One guy opened the door for us and what looked like a small restaurant opened up as they had a bunch of tables to the left! 

The place is nicely decorated with lots of photos.  In the front one photo of John Catucci (Food Network host - You gotta eat here) just next to the cash register.  Behind the counter was a professional looking Espresso/Cappucino machine!  This to me is another good sign!  

15 minutes later I got my food.  I ordered a #10 Tutta Bella Pizza (mushrooms, sausage pepperoni, cheese) and a Pennine Arrabiatta.  Driving home the smell in the car made me salivate like a hungry dog!  

Amazing selection:

7 different salads, 41 pizzas and 34 pastas.  I also counted 20 different desserts!  

What I can say about the food is this is some of the best reasonably priced Italian you can find in Montreal.  It's also bring your own wine!  Pizza was thin crust but with the tomato sauce on top!  Flavour and texture was amazing!  Arrabiatta was awesome too penne was cooked el dente!  I think the best Italian food is some of the simplest in terms of ingredients but the flavour you remember!  

*****Beware!  They only take cash, but claim to have an ATM on site!  I'd recommend coming early or if you don't mind waiting as it appears to be a very popular restaurant!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and an amazing Bufala \"salad\" (really it's just cheese and tomato, let's be real, but that's heaven). We arrived late and were seated quickly, service was quick, and price was reasonable.

It's a little loud, and I don't love the TV screens in the restaurant, really distracting - but I think that's the vibe they're going for. There were birthday parties, drunk teenagers, couples, an old man alone reading...it's a good people watching spot. And the decor is cheesy and great."}
{"text":"great casual date spot. everyone working has a super relaxed, welcoming and nonintrusive attitude. menu selection is large and simple. keep in mind its cash only and bring your own wine - there's nowhere really nearby to get an affordable bottle, and their ATM will charge you :-) been here several times and it's been consistently great!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here since 1990. The food is exactly the same... Amazing!
You don't come here for the service you come here for the food and bring your own wine.
Yeah you might wait a while outside.
Yeah the service is whatever. 
Yeah it's loud 
Yeah tip is included
Yeah they only take cash. 

But damm the margarita pizza, spaghetti meat sauce, penne a la romana, the sausages with chimichurri, the palmare salad and the killer good wine your gonna bring and drink in those tiny water glasses, well that my friends just makes up for a lot of bothers in life. I'm going to be back in Montreal in June for the whole summer, and let's just say I'm counting days and nights to go there and I smell the food in my sleep."}
{"text":"Cafeteria style dining with fairly authentic italian style pizza and pasta. Great for kids. A little pricey considering the output volume, but solid flavours. BYOWine makes the mildly steep prices a little more reasonable! The sausage and rapini pasta is a personal favourite!"}
{"text":"Une institution à Montréal dont je ne connaissais pas l'existence jusqu'à tout récemment. 

La pizza? Rien d'incroyable. Bonne mais vraiment pas extraordinaire. Croûte mince avec légumes coupés en dés sur la \"Campagnola\". Un peu déçue...
Par contre, les fettuccine alfredo étaient très bons. 

Vous pouvez y apporter votre vin. 
Argent comptant seulement. 
Vous avez votre table pour 2 heures. 
Service rapide efficace mais expéditif..."}
{"text":"Toujours bondé de gens, service expéditif invitant vite au départ pour laisser les nouveaux arrivants à prendre place, pizzas très ordinaires et service médiocre: la fois où j'y suis allé on nous a carrément fait tomber les assiettes sur la table."}
{"text":"Amazing place, very reliable for quality and taste. Best pizza and pasta you can find in town. Always busy even at 10pm, so make sure you have patience to wait. Service is fast, and food is fresh all the time."}
{"text":"There is no doubt this is the best pizza place in Montreal."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. I haven't been here in years and let me assure you, nothing has changed. The pizza is to die for. Considering its BYOW and the pizza is phenomenal, why not go here??? Reminds me of real home made Italian pizza. Not too greasy, not too over dressed ... Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Italian-American Robbed in Naples (Canada) 

This is a straight rip off Pizza Joint. Stay Away. 

Girlfriend and I were looking to grab a nice pizza in the Little Italy section of Montreal. This was probably our first mistake as \"Little Italy\" is usually known as a collection of rip off restaurants anywhere in the world (or \"ladri\" as they say in Italian), and it wouldn't be any different in this Canadian adaptation. 

Mistake #2 was eating at any establishment that has Naples in their name. Google \"Naples\" to see what it is synonymous with (hint: more crooks and thievery than pizza)

As we sat down to grab pizza, our waiter kindly mentioned that if we didn't like all of the ingredients on a certain style of pizza, we could swap it out with 1 (ONE) (UNO) ingredient from another pizza, in which then it would be considered equal value. A meat for a meat, a topping for a topping etc etc. However, a second or even a third alteration would cost extra. Great! Duly noted! 

I ordered the #29 with tomatoes, mozzarella, bocconcini and red peppers. Instead of the red peppers I decided to swap that out with chili peppers for a spicier kick. 

My girlfriend ordered the #13 with mushrooms, mozzarella, olives, and capicolla, but decided to swap out the capicolla with \"prosciuttino\" (aka we make you think it's fancy but we just charge you more for what is basically prosciutto). 

When our pizzas arrived, my face was stunned to see a Margherita (which is basically a plain normal pizza, for those uninformed) that was literally a pie with tomato, mozzarella, and pepper flakes on top. Yes, the same exact pepper flakes that were right next to us on our table and considered to be a free topping. Go on patrons, shake on as much as you wish. 

I'm not usually one to make a scene, but this was a bit perplexing since the pizza before me was more expensive than a plain margherita. I called the waiter over to ask where the chili peppers and the bocconcini were hidden and he pointed out to me that the bocconcini had melted in the same space as the mozzarella and the chili peppers were merely the dried pepper flakes lying there motionless on my pizza. 

The taste was of a thin crust, sub par pizza with generic mozzarella cheese, and tomato sauce that tasted neither as though it were fresh nor like it was any different than canned tomato paste you find in cheap super markets. My girlfriend said hers tasted ok. From what I could see from my vantage point, her pizza at least had a semblance of different ingredients on it. 4 sorry looking olives and 4 pieces of what looked like prosciutto.  

When the bill arrived, we noticed that this establishment was surely trying to purloin the last bit of Canadian dollars we had in our pockets. My girlfriend's pizza had now cost extra due to the meat swap and obviously my sad mess was still the ridiculous price of a Margherita Napoletana (aka we call a plain pizza a fancy name and take your money)

We attempted to argue that the waiter had told us a simple meat swap would not cost extra but it was of no use. Apparently the prosciutto costs 1 dollar extra than the capicolla. Best part is the waiter never even mentioned this casual detail when we were placing our order. God forbid my girlfriend had asked for different piece of charcuterie topping. I shudder to think of the cost this place might have incurred.  GASP! \"Importing\" old meats from down the street. Ladies and Gents, remember that small detail... if you ever dare venture into this flimflam establishment. 

In hindsight, arguing with the cashier sort of felt like complaining to the police in Naples after you've been robbed of all your belongings. They simply nod and say you should have known better, and they continue to go about reading their gazzetta dello sport. 

Next time I want to get robbed after eating pizza, I might as well venture off to the real \"pizza napoletana\" in Naples. At least I can wash it down with a nice Limoncello.

Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Came here again.. this place is good.. we like it.. it has yummy pizzas, it's BYOW, and has a lively atmosphere.. there's just something a bit miss with the service I feel.. you constantly feel rushed, the staff barely stand still to take your order and midway through appetizers (at about $15 each) mains are slammed down as soon as they're ready followed by the check mid meal.. everything is attended to it just seems rushed and a bit frustrated.. my wife made the observation that it was all male staff, and maybe they need a female on the team, which we thought was funny..

otherwise we like it.. great pizzas, but it'd be nice if the guys took 4.5s to just say and act out some basic pleasantries etc. at $30 per person, i don't think it's that crazy to feel a need for.."}
{"text":"Si vous aimez ce qu'on vous passe dans les grandes chaînes, restez-y... On est en Italie ici et c'est à mon avis une des meilleures pizza de la ville de Montréal. Les saucisses italiennes dans l'huile d'olive avec persil sont excellentes. C'est hyper bruyant, kitsch et les gens sont toujours heureux. Viva Italia!"}
{"text":"Our first time in Montreal and we decided to go to little Italy. We went to la napolitana.  People were waiting to go in. The wait was not bad 20 minutes.  The waiter was not very friendly, however the host was nice. But once the food came it was so good it was delicious."}
{"text":"Perfect thin crust pizza, so many to choose from, I wanted to try everything!  If you are with friends, each order a pizza and everyone share so you can have a variety!  We had 3 pizzas between 4 people and we were stuffed at the end.  Amazing pizza in Montreal, but bring cash, and expect a wait if coming on a weekend when its nice out!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I'm from NYC and raised in an Italian household. We know pizza. 

Now that that's out of the way, the pizza was ok. Mediocre to ok. The crust was unflavored, thinner than I expected, but the size wasn't the issue as much as the lack of taste. The sauce was disappointing, also lacking much flavor. And the toppings were good, but nothing I really couldn't get at any below average to average pizzeria back home.

I got the white pizza with prosciutto and arugula, and it was definitely decent. The cheese had good flavor as well as the ricotta that was on it, and the arugula definitely made it extra flavorful, but it would have benefitted from some salt and pepper, or olive oil, or just something to make it the way it should be - really really flavorful. 

My wife got basically a meat lovers pizza, which sounded good until we both tried it and it immediately reminded us of the meat lovers pizza at Pizza Hut from our childhood when we would get the free pizza for reading a certain number of books at school!  Not exactly the flavor I was expecting nor wanted. 

As for the decor, the place is over the top gaudy and stereotypical. Pictures of the Mona Lisa, the School of Athens, Scarface, as well as a tree covered in the tri-color lights in the middle of the restaurant...a bit over the top, but if they really like it, more power to them

Overall, the servers were very nice and accommodating, the food was eh, and the prices were kind of high for what you get. Also, they don't take credit cards, which could be difficult when you have a limited amount of cash in a foreign country!"}
{"text":"The food here is incredible. The staff is wonderful. I have never had better Italian food in Canada. A Montreal blog ranks this restaurant high, so we decided to try it out our first night there. We went back for supper the very next day. 
You have to go to this restaurant. 
It's also bring your own wine"}
{"text":"If I were judging this just on the food, it'd be a pretty easy four stars - the pizza was quite good with a nice thin crust; a little bit skimpy on toppings for the price maybe, but it was a tasty pizza nonetheless.

Unfortunately, both servers we had during the course of the meal were neither friendly or helpful. It wasn't a particularly busy night, but I don't think they said a single word to us until the very end of our visit when we took out a debit card to pay, which the server saw and mumbled something as he walked away. We eventually figured out the mumble was \"cash only\", which (as far as I could tell) was not displayed anywhere beforehand."}
{"text":"This place is seriously delicious and the most perfect portion size ever! I got the mushroom and black olive pizza and it was delicious! The toppings are under the sauce and cheese as well as on top so when you bite into your pizza, everything stays in place instead of toppings and cheese sliding off and burning your chin. (That always seems to happen to me haha)

Had the tirimasu also and it was soooo good!

I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"As someone who's lived in Naples for several years of his life, I have anticipated my visit to this restaurant for many years apprehensively knowing fully well how a Napoletana pizza should taste like. (And for the record, if you're ever in Sorrento, Italy.. go to Panetteria-Pizzeria Franco for the best pizza on the planet!)

After passing by this area one night and seeing the ridiculously long lines outside at 7 PM to come into this place, I was convinced I should make the visit after reading these generous 5 star reviews to this little pizzeria. How can they be 'wrong'? :)

I made it a point to visit it during lunch to avoid the lines.

But were the previous reviews to be true?


DECOR :

Situated on a small street where parking in the area is a nuisance with locals getting all the privileged spots, you can find yourself spending a significant amount of time getting your car parked. Once you walk up to the pizzeria on the side of the street you can't help but notice a small side patio with ugly cheap aluminum-looking tables that I eventually found out were very uneven and needed to be balanced by the gruff waiter twice.

I didn't spend a whole lot of time on the inside of the restoraunt as I wanted to be seated outside due to the fantastic weather. 

However, my first impression was that it looked small and cluttered and I don't see this place being viable for a quiet romantic dinner but more for a family and noisy place.


FOOD :

I ordered a Napoletana pizza (mushrooms, mozzarella, anchovies, parmesan cheese, tomato sauce) and a Chinotto Brio. Sadly, the pizza was loaded with a cheap, salty parmigiano cheese that overwhelmed the flavors of the other ingredients. I had hoped for better quality of ingredients but this single thing ruined a possibly good pizza for me. I'll definitely have to avoid the parmesan the next time.


SERVICE :

The service was lacking, even if the place was moderately busy. I waited in the front of the store with 2-3 other couples while no one greeted us coming in and looked on the staff discussing sports at the counter with each other for well over a minute.

My waiter was gruff and didn't have a whole lot to say. I genuinely felt that I was bothering him being a single patron taking a table of 2 on the patio where half the tables were already unused.  

I also wasn't given water until I asked for it  after I received my pizza and I waited close to 15 minutes to pay my bill completely unsure if I was going to pay at the table or at the counter. T

The service could have been far better than it was considering it wasn't that busy and annoyed me greatly.


PRICE :

This place can be expensive with most pizzas being priced around 15-16$ on average. Expect to pay a good amount money and make sure to have the cash on you as this place ONLY ACCEPTS CASH!


BOTTOM LINE :

I can't help but compare this place to my favorite Napoletana styled pizza place... La Bottega and simply shake my head as it's unfair to do so as La Bottega overall quality of food, service and decor overwhelms this small rustic place by a long shot. 

If you also want a nice classy and romantic place to have dinner, this is not the place to go to neither.

I might come back eventually and try a pizza without the cheap parmesan stuff but I have far too many other pizza places to visit before doing so."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!! It's a great BYOB and perfect for groups. Make sure you arrive early because there's almost always a line-up!! Try the buffala mozzarella salad, the rapini pizza/pasta and a cannoli for desert - and you're all set!"}
{"text":"I am hoping that at some point I will be able to update this review with a better rating because I have had good experiences here in the past. There's always a long line and they don't take reservations unless it's for larger groups (great for them making good business but if you come during peak hours/days be prepared to wait) , cash only and service is very hit or miss. The food isn't bad but it didn't blow me away. I wasn't a fan of their pasta or their classic gnocchi , while not horrible it lacks a bit in the way of flavour and slightly overdone for me. Their pizza is the better option by far and a lot of people I know really like it a lot. I do like it but I can't say it is my first choice for pizza in town. On the plus side this is a bring your own wine in little ltaly and is big enough to handle groups (indoor and some outdoor seating). This is more a family joint or a place for a casual group dinner as opposed to a romantic date type option. I wouldn't be opposed to coming back because like I said the food wasn't bad but if left up to me this wouldn't be my first choice for pizza/pasta spots but definitely wouldn't discourage anyone from trying for themselves !"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in Montreal. They have a terrace outside with a cute little view of little Italy. Their menu has a lot of delicious options, and the service was absolutely amazing. The food came extremely quickly and the waiter that served us was very kind! :) I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Many people have raved about Pizzeria Napoletana to me over the years but I have never understood the hype.  The restaurant has been around for years and is quite a popular spot.  Even on the Monday night that I came the joint was jumping.

The decor is a little dated and you can tell that they haven't really updated it much over the years.  The walls are covered with photos that pay tribute to the restaurant's Italian and Neapolitan roots.  They really cram the tables in there so it can feel like space is at a premium.  I also found the chairs a little uncomfortable and noticed that my back was aching by the time I left.

Now as someone who has experienced the real Neapolitan pizza in Naples I had great expectations and certain standards.  Unfortunately I was left disappointed by the pizza here.  I ordered a Verona pizza, which had mushrooms, eggplants and zucchini.  First up the crust was paper thin and more like a cracker than pizza crust.  I also felt that they used cheap mozzarella and that there wasn't very much of it.  That pizza was about $17 and I have to say that I have experienced much better ones for more reasonable prices.

Remember to have lots of cash on you if you come here because it's cash only and if you don't have enough your only option is one of those generic ATMs that charge exorbitant fees.  It's also a BYOB so if you want a drink with dinner plan ahead.  The closest SAQ is probably the one at the Jean Talon market.

I have to say that my visit here left me underwhelmed.  The pizza just didn't do it for me and I feel like there are other pizza places in this city that offer a much better product for a more reasonable price.  I'm not sure I'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Nourriture excellente. La pizza est incroyable. Dommage que le service soit très mauvais. Les serveurs ont aucune façon."}
{"text":"I feel semi guilty leaving this review because the food truly is excellent. Also the fact that it is a byow makes it the perfect place for a night out with friends. However, the management leaves a lot to be desired. They only take reservations for big groups- understandable because it is always packed there on the weekends. I called a week in advance and made a reservation for 10 people under my name. Upon arriving to the restaurant with my group, I told them my name and they said that they had a reservation for \"Sophie\" and not \"Sam\". After concluding that they must have made an error writing my name, they quickly seated us. About 5 minutes later, the real Sophie arrived asking for her table. This is when the staff made a terrible call. They came to me and said that I had lied about making a reservation and told us we had to leave. I argued for about 5 minutes with them to no avail. I showed them proof of a 1.5 minute conversation with the restaurant the week before but they continued to be very rude and refused to take responsibility for the mix up. Eventually they found a table for Sophie's group (who was much more understanding than the restaurant thank goodness) and they stopped telling us to leave. Mistakes do happen and I would have appreciated an apology. 
The rest of the meal was excellent. The pizza and pasta I shared with a friend were delish and the wine helped calm me down as I was quite furious due to he restaurant's approach.

Last issue was that when I was in line to pay, an older woman (possible owner or manager) was punching in our meals for us to pay. I asked for the bill right after handing her my money and she said that I would have to wait in line to get the bill (at least 10 people were behind me). I found that to be super sketchy and after telling her I'd wait, she seemed to still not want to give me a bill..
Overall, this one really bad experience tainted my view of the restaurant. However, this is not to say I won't give it another try.

{"text":"I've been living in Montreal for years and hadn't actually heard about this place until I saw an episode of \"You Gotta Eat Here!\" on Food Network. I've read a lot of positive reviews and can say this place serves good pizza.
First impression is that the place looks small, cluttered, and definitely very noisy. It's family friendly, not so much a good place for a romantic dinner.

My dining partner expected to order a classic \"all dressed\" pizza, but we were overwhelmed with the menu choices and combinations.  It's a good thing the service was a little slow, gave us time to contemplate the options. After making our selection and ordering a drink, waiter informed us the soda was on the house due to long wait.
We got some bread and butter, which I found too chewy and tough. I can't tell if that's just its texture, or that it wasn't very fresh. 
Pizzas were good, albeit very salty. I ordered the Rustica one: mozzarella, bonccocini,  tomato slices and pancetta. I was very glad they left an entire carafe of water because I had to down so many glasses....
Portion size was enough to fill me.

For dessert, we tried their Lemoncello and Ferrero Rocher cakes which were light and fluffy. Not too sweet. A good end to this meal.

However main drawbacks were pricing, which I found a little steep. Their pizzas range from 10 to 20 $, most of them within the 15 $ range and these are individual portions. 
Also, my biggest complaint is that this place ONLY ACCEPTS CASH!
I guess they're keeping it old school, and not only that, even their ATM machine is outdated.
Both my boyfriend and I tried using their ATM and got refused, to find out that it does not accept cards with a microchip (which almost all bank cards have nowadays!) . Luckily there is a convenience store across the street where we were able to pull out some money.

I never pay anything in cash and was quite shocked to find a well established restaurant, serving full menu and full house for years to lack any debit or credit card terminal.

So if you plan to go as a family or group, make sure you bring cash and lots of it."}
{"text":"J'ai connu mieux en terme de pizza croûte mince à Montréal...Ambiance cafétéria, service expéditif et bâclé, prix abordables, mais ça sera pour moi, la dernière fois ici. L'entrée était simple et bonne (antipasto napoletana 10$) tranches de jambon, salamis, anchois, curs de palmiers, câpres, artichauts & tomates. Comme j'aime évalué les pizzas, je prends toujours des pizzas margheritas sachant que tous les restos italiens en préparent. Voilà donc ma pizza margherita (12$) qui arrive, je la coûte, un gros bof, sans plus, pas de qualité, pas de goût extra, pâte à pizza pas assez cuite, style de pizza surgelée d'un supermarché, pas la meilleure en tout cas, juste déçu! À savoir, argent comptant seulement, pas de cartes de débit/crédit acceptées, y'a un guichet sur place pour retirer.

2/5 visité en avril 2016"}
{"text":"I wish my experience lived up to the legend that this pizzeria carries with it. My pizza did not arrive piping hot with the cheese looking nice and melty as a pizza should look like. It was dry and notably not very tasty - though perhaps it had something to do with the fact that there was no meat on my pizza (just zucchini and eggplant). The crust was also not something I would remember fondly either. On the other hand, I had a taste of my friend's lasagne, and it was REALLY good. If I ever do come back, I will bypass the pizza for the pastas, but with the lineups so long to begin with, I doubt I ever will."}
{"text":"1) Best pizza in Canada if not in North America 
2) Excellent pasta but the way they make there pasta is boring no chicken in  fettuccini Alfredo no sun dried tomatoes no onions no garnishing it's just a basic pasta that's all but it's still good quality,
3) Excelemt service 
4) Friendly employees
5) It's time to buy new plates and knifes and forks they are old all scratched up
6) Dessert are really really really bad, they are prepackaged  tasteless and disgusting NOT ITALIAN STYLE :))
7) I WILL NEVER GO ANYWHERE ELSE FOR PIZZA SIMPLY THE BEST"}
{"text":"Pasta is awesome, pizza good, ambiance great and the staff friendly. You feel at home when you come here with good friends, family and a bottle of wine. Typically bring your own wine places in Montreal are pretty average or less than average when it comes to the food.

This place is better. The pasta was cooked perfectly, the sauce great, pizza was very good and the Parmesan is fresh. We asked for basil and they brought us a bowl of fresh leaves which we enjoyed. It would've been nice if you told us he was going to charge us extra for that. But hey. The vino kept us nice. 

Other mediocre points: the pepperoni was not that great, the butter was hard cold and it's cash only. 

It was a beautiful night, tables outside looked comfortable but there's more room inside so that's where we were seated. There's always a line!"}
{"text":"I make it a point to go once a month at least... I have to admit I am a foodie... so I go to lots of restaurants. Some of them keep me coming back. Napoletana is one of them... maybe even my favorite in the city. The food is outstanding, the quality of the ingredients is excellent and it's consistent. Love it! 
(FYI: It's BYOW)"}
{"text":"So many people have been telling me about this place but it took a friend's bday to finally get me there. Pizza among my favorite foods and, as such, undergoes the more of scrutiny than would any other dish in front of me. That being said, I wasn't disappointed.

PROs
- Great selection of both conservative and adventurous za's
- Quality ingredients and execution (my smoked turkey/jalapeno was divine)
      o Thin crust gave the slice structure without a deafening crunch
      o Cheese gave good coverage without being overly greasy
      o Sauce was present enough to add flavor and bring the ingredients together without                    making a sloppy mess
      o Toppings were fresh and each contributed to the overall flavor
- The staff is very friendly and efficient


CONs
- I'll update if I can think of something but I doubt that will be the case

Notes:
The place is a BYOW so it's great for a date or big party. The loud and bustling atmosphere is probably the result of the wine-drunk patrons. Personally, I prefer being in a vibrant atmosphere when I'm enjoying good pizza and drink with friends but I leave others to decide their preferences."}
{"text":"Salle très bruyante, ambiance cantine, ça passe encore.
Mais grosse déception sur les pizzas : pas de gout, garnies à l'arrache, pâte seche....Le tout pas donné. J'ai mangé de bien meilleures pizzes à mtl."}
{"text":"Upon hearing excellent things about Pizzeria Napoletana, my friends and I who were visiting from Buffalo, NY were excited to check out this historic staple. Us Western New Yorkers take our pizza (and wings) very seriously so you could imagine our astonishment and abhorrence when our pizza arrived. They could've served this on an 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper and we wouldn't have known the difference. I've had thin crust pizza before but this crust was more comparable to a saltine cracker. It was without a doubt the worst pizza we have ever had in our lives. I would take a frozen Mama Celeste over this any day. On top of that it took almost an hour for this sorry excuse for a pizza to come out. Our entrees arrived shortly after and we were mainly satisfied with those, aside from the huge bay leaf my friend picked out of his entree. To top it off, our server never once checked in on us or asked us if we needed anything else during our time. We would love to visit Montreal again, but we would never visit Pizzeria Napoletana again."}
{"text":"This place was okay, but really not up to our expectations. The service was meh, and the food was good but not anything special, which is disappointing for little Italy. The pizza itself is large but the quantity of ingredients is not generous. We came a second time to give it another chance but I don't think we will go back. 
Also, note that it is cash only!"}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant quoi qu'un peu bruyant. Bon choix de pâtes et de pizza. Très savoureux.   Nous avons du attendre une vingtaine de minutes avant d'obtenir une table. C'était plein un mercredi soir. Super qu'on puisse apporter notre vin. Ne prennent pas aucune carte de crédit ni même de débit."}
{"text":"Un voyage en Italie pour moins de 20$ ça se fait? Ici, oui!

C'est un resto \"apportez votre vin\" qui sert principalement des pizzas et des pâtes simples mais oh combien délicieuses. Ça paraît que tout est fait maison et selon la tradition italienne. J'imagine la grand-mère dans la cuisine qui surveille les cuisiniers pour s'assurer que tout y est! Les prix varient mais en général, vous sortirez de là, peut-être même avec un plat à emporter, pour moins de 20$ par personne. Et vous serez content d'avoir un lunch pour le lendemain parce que c'est assez bon pour en rêver pendant des jours, des semaines, des mois.

Le resto se remplit assez rapidement, alors soyez patients, ça en vaut vraiment la peine, ou bien faites vos réservations à l'avance. On est assez serré avec les autres tables, mais ça ajoute un élément chaleureux et vibrant à l'endroit. Un must à essayer en petit groupe ou bien pour un souper romantique sans trop de fla fla. Comme Hugues le dit, ça peut être bruyant alors vous pourrez en profiter pour vous regarder dans les yeux!"}
{"text":"This bring your own wine and share a pizza or pasta dish with friends. This place is always busy so be prepared to wait for a table. Food is very good but you can order 3 plates for 2. I prefer the pasta over the pizza, don't misunderstand, he pizza is very good but my opinion the pasta is a better choice. So I go back to 'order 3 plates for 2 people '. It's always fun to share.
Staff is friendly and efficient and the place can get loud."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza  Gotta try the pasta, seeming equally deli. Would get 5 stars if they would accept getting paid by CC or DC."}
{"text":"Mmmm so much choice and it's all completely awesome: thin crust pizzas, pastas, gnocci. Everything is done to perfection and the service is top notch. You may end up sharing a table with complete strangers, but who cares, that's totally fun! There is truly something for everyone on this menu and you cannot go wrong no matter what you pick.

I had the Chef pizza: mozzarella, black olives and tomatoes; it was deeelish.

Best part about Napoletana is that it's BYOW, yesssss! (There's an SAQ a 3 minute walk away, so there is no need to settle for a bottle of Chateau Dépanneur.)

Oh yeah, and it's cash only!"}
{"text":"Now I tried both Amelios and Napoletana, since both claim to have the best pizza in town. The very clear winner is .... drumroll...Napoletana.  Try the Mediterrana with blue cheese. Sounds unusual, but is absolutely delicious!

Our waiter was friendly and sociable. It is a BYOB, and we had brought two bottles by accident. The waiter charmingly resolved the issue by picking the wine for us - of course he went for the Italian.
The only drawback was that we had to wait quite a bit to get in. Clearly it is no secret how good the food is. Consequently the place was buzzing with customers of all ages, and a little bit noisy. But in the end - the great pizza makes more than up for any slight inconvenience."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good food, BYOW! I had the fettucini verona which was delish - loved the sauce! My friend wanted a surprise for her pizza and they didn't dissappoint. The cannoli was soo yummy also - must try! Our waitors were very nice as well."}
{"text":"If there is one blind spot in my Montreal food repertoire that I feel somewhat embarrassed about, it is Pizza. Despite my absolute love of all things Pizza related - I could honestly eat pizza everyday if such a thing were reasonable from a dietary point of view - I have not exploring many of Montreal's fine establishments. If someone were to ask me where to get a great slice of pizza, I honestly wouldn't have an answer that I could base on personal experience. Well... I want to change that. So last weekend, I took the opportunity after a visit to Jean Talon Market to try a Little Italy institution, Pizzeria Napoletana.

Right off the bat, I am not a staunch advocate of either thin crust or deep dish pizza. I give equal time to both sides... as long as it is done right. In this instance, we would be treated to a classic Italian thin crust pizza. When coming to a place that has been doing it since 1948, one hopes you will be getting a great slice of pie. With thin crust, you are looking for a nice crisp base but one that still has a bit of chewiness to it. Too thin or crisp and you get something that tastes completely burnt. On the toppings front, you want a nice tomato sauce and good cheese. You want just enough of both to cover the dough but not so much that it overwhelms the flavor of the crust.

I decided to go with a Quattro Fromaggi pizza for my first try. Before I add extra ingredients, I want to see if the basic pizza is done well. Napoletana uses Mozzarella, Parmesan, Romano and bocconcini for their version. This was a very well done pizza. It pretty much had everything I was looking for. Crispy yet tender crust - check. Bonus points for the slightly burnt edge as well. Right amount of both sauce and cheese - check. Tangy tomato sauce - check. Nice mix of cheese - check. Very satisfying pizza overall.

My sister went with a even simpler pizza on her end - the classic Margarita. Once again, a very nice pizza with the same characteristics of the previous one minus the added notes of the Romano and bocconcini cheese.

As the 1st true entry in the Montreal Pizza search, Pizzeria Napoletana was exactly what I expected from a Montreal Institution - a place that serves solid pizza, tried and true. It was a good initial benchmark to set my expectations for a good Montreal Pizza. Walking into the restaurant, you absolutely get that old school pizzeria feel - the pictures of celebrities on the walls, all the staff in restaurant t-shirts and caps, paper placemats and the fact that this still only take cash. If you're looking for a classic Napoli style pizza, this is a good place to start.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my third visit to this restaurant in two years. I was hoping that maybe this time the service won't be rude, but I was wrong. 
From the moment you walk in you feel like you're being taken for granted because of the unexplainable hype that this place has.
We were four people, two of us were there for the first time. The waiter was rude from the start, and when asked for parmesan for the pasta that he just brought us, he just pointed at a small jar on the table (which we haven't noticed was there), made a face and took off, never to be seen again. 
The restaurant wasn't busy at all and it wasn't during rush hours. 
No \" enjoy your food \", no \" how is everything \", no more water, no more bread. NOTHING! 
The two stars I gave is just for the food, which was nice, but nothing special. 
There are dozens of Italian restaurants in that neighbourhood, serving exactly the same food. We'll be exploring other options next time we're craving some pasta or pizza. It's all the same anyway."}
