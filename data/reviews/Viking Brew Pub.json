{"text":"We've been here 2x now and each time the appetizer plates are dirty.  This time there was actually enough food on them we could scrap it off with our fingers.  And the service is slow.  Come on Stoughton."}
{"text":"Very slow service. I have been there twice and the first time was slow, ordered iced tea and the waitress brought ice water and just failed to check in to see if we needed refills or anything else. The kids liked the Viking ship bar and wanted to go back.

Second visit was offensively slow. We debated just leaving after an hour since our waitress was no where to be found. There were several other people in the place but not many seemed to be eating, it was apparently karaoke night which was loud and obnoxious, but didn't explain why the at least the waitresses couldn't keep up with the couple tables eating. After we finally got our food we never saw our waitress again, I finally had to ask the bartender for the check. While doing so she must have wandered from the back and he called out to her that he was getting us or check for her in a kind of hint hint go check on your table kind of way. She stared helplessly for a second trying to process if she should come over or not and then just meandered back into the back. Even my kids, who really loved the Viking ship, don't want to go back; one fell asleep waiting and the other lost his appetite and just wanted to take his food home. It's a shame because our send like a cool place and fit stoughtons Norwegian theme well. Hopefully the restaurant that moves into that space next can play on the theme while offering better service."}
{"text":"Really great pub experience! Great pub food, really great beer! The food has a creative Norwegian spin. The beer is worth the trip, met with the brew master David, gave us a private tour of the brewery area, just from asking! And a smoking dragon-headed-boat-bar! We'll be back."}
{"text":"I was excited to see this new brewpub open here in Stoughton, and checked it out last night with some friends. While it seems like they're stilling working out some of the kinks of being new, it's definitely a fun place to hang out and has some good beer. 

The \"Viking\" theme in their decor is striking--especially the bar shaped like the prow of a ship! The main bar area is spacious, with plenty of seating, including tables and booths. There are several big TVs throughout the space, which gives it a bit of a sports-bar feel. Not usually my favorite kind of place, but there was enough other stuff going on in the decor/atmosphere that it was pleasant even for this non-sports-loving gal. We also discovered a cozy little back area with some couches, which is where we spent the evening. We had a server offer to bring us our drinks, and she was very friendly and attentive.

The beer menus they had were inaccurate--apparently, they were newly printed and the bar didn't have all the beers in stock yet. However, they did have their 3 in-house brews plus some other options, and our server was good at making recommendations. I tried the Midnite Sun, the house-brew cream ale, which was refreshing but a little bland for my taste (though I'm also not a big fan of Spotted Cow, everyone's favorite cream ale, so if you like that, you might love the Midnite Sun). My husband tried the Soot in My Eye, their black IPA, which was rich, complex, and a bit spicy. I didn't taste the Nordic Blonde, their other house brew, but perhaps next time! 

As far as food, they only serve pizza right now, but the server indicated that they will be offering more food some time soon. I think once they have their beer and food menus sorted out, this place will be even better. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Whenever we go on vacation, my husband and I always seek out the closest brewery for a meal. When in Stoughton recently with the kids, we checked out Viking Brew Pub first for a flight and to see if it would be a good fit for a large party we were going to be dining with later that night. Tried four beer and was pleasantly surprised by each! Came back later and had a great meal. Service was super friendly and efficient on both visits!"}
{"text":"The jalapeno poppers were so yummy!  And the berry dipping sauce sounded strange at first but balanced the flavors oh so well.  I had the Portobello sandwich and homemade fries with cheese sauce. Great sandwich . I wish the chips would've hot though. 

I'm not a beer drinker, but they did have a full bar.
The ambiance was great,  beautiful Viking ship bar, and lots of great looking natural wood tables, etc."}
{"text":"I would not advise going here unless you have unlimited time.  The service is extremely slow.   The food is average and the plates and silverware are not quite clean.   Also, don't expect to get your drinks refilled quickly or without having to flag someone down to get them."}
{"text":"Sterile atmosphere, inattentive service. Didn't try the food. Might try one more time but with great reservation."}
{"text":"Have gone in a few times. Beers are good. The green beans and cheese curds are good. Staff has been friendly. The first time we went could tell our server was new but she asked for help when she needed it and did a good job too. The second time sat at the bar. The bartender was awesome. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I debated giving them a four star review, really. 

Here's my list of why I like the place:
- Environment, super cute and I love the viking ship that does occasionally blow out a little steam and it's very spacious. 
- Beer, pretty good, my husband enjoys it.
- Food, delicious it's made fresh and they offer things that aren't offered anywhere else in Stoughton. 
- Service, friendly and willing to help you with a couple of suggestions if you can't decide what beer or food you want.

Now my list of why only 3-stars:
- Bar, WAY WAY WAY under stocked. I know, I know I should be there for a beer but can't blame for me for just wanting a good rum or hard cider once in a while.
- Food, it's just such a tiny menu and I feel that each time I go they either change the ingredients or get rid of something all together without taking it off their menus. 
- Prices, eh. I'm willing to pay them but eh. 

I do plan on going back, it's a great place to meet with friends and family and since it's right in the middle of Main St it motivates me to go shopping in the small stores surrounding it."}
{"text":"Most recent visit was 11/21 and I am looking for excuses to get back to Stoughton to have another beer at this place.  Very nice, professional, fun staff and overall great atmosphere.   I am not a big fan of brewpub beer but I gotta tell I had all three of them on this visit.  Very nice!  Rumor has it they have live music from time to time, every little town in WI should be so lucky to have a bar like this."}
{"text":"The service was quick and with a smile. Food was good. The chili was homemade and delicious.  Love the beers. Dragon's Milk is definitely a Must Try!!! Will be back. .. thanks for letting us hang out."}
{"text":"Came for their Norwegian meatball special on Saturday night. Had reservation for 7 people at 6:30 got there at 6:20 and table was ready: great.  Drink order wasn't taken until 6:45.  We then tried to order appetizers and meal at 7(after the table behind us ordered even though they got here 15 minutes after us) to be told they were out of the special plus the cod plus another entree. We asked for more time since what we came for was gone. . 15 minutes later we tried to order to be told they are all out of the pulled pork. 2nd time I've been here in 2 months and they seem to run out of food and beer. Not really good for a brew pub.  Friend went there 2 weeks ago and same experience. Seems to be a pattern of running out of food and drinks. Maybe it is a new category:  \"hope we have some\" brew pub.  KH"}
{"text":"We've tried it a few times since.....service is still rude and slow....now that they serve 'food' it's even worse.  Crowd is very clique-y.  Who wants to get the stare down from people just because you  walk in?  Owner is clueless....because his 'friends' keep telling him how great it is.  Since its a brewery....well....yeah, about that.  They don't seem to have the basics down for any style."}
{"text":"Couple of things I would like to add. Viking Brewpub has a daily specials menu to augment their regular menu for those that don't want the great bar food menu on offer. The daily specials is more adventurous, not crazy, but not run of the mill either. Definitely worth a try.  The other is that the dragon head that forms part of the bar actually breaths fire! Yes! Don't worry, it is a fog machine, but it is pretty neat to see the smoke coming out of the dragons nose. I know the dragon has an official name, which I wish I could remember."}
{"text":"The inside is beautiful.  The bar is made of wood and has a dragon on the end that spits smoke.  

Nice menu, but a little overpriced in my honest opinion.

Beer is tasty and original.

Service is slow."}
{"text":"We went here as a family while we were in town for our daughter's volleyball game. We sat almost 10 minutes before our server came to take our drink order. While we waited we looked at pretty limited food menu and a hand written beer list with things scratched off updating the beers they were out of. I think it would serve them better to type it up, way more professional. Our waitress mentioned they were still getting everything straightened out from just opening. Her comments made me think they had only been open a few weeks, but it looks like they have been open a while.

We ordered our food and drink right away when the came. The food didn't take too long. Our meals were ok, my husband and I each got burgers that were ok. The kids split a chicken strip meal,  again just ok. 

If you are just looking for a place to drink beer and have ok service this place would be ok. Until they work out the kitchen kinks we wouldn't go back for more then beers,"}
{"text":"We love this place. We live in Stoughton and joined their mug club. I like that the beers rotate and there's always something everyone can enjoy. I also like that it's smaller, kind of cozy. Makes things even better. We try to go once a week and it's worth it. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The cheese curds are so good. The bar is a Viking ship! How cool is that? It's a really cool place with a lot of good bar food and drinks."}
{"text":"A group of us, 3 couples, came here  for dinner after a concert at the Opera House.  It's a great location and easy to find.    I had a read a number of positive reviews so had high expectations.  But in a nutshell, we were all disappointed in both the service (slow, inattentive, forgetful) and the food (over cooked, long waits for beverages, refills and food, etc.).   The pub was not busy, but it was an off time when we were there. We don't plan to return."}
{"text":"We were able to get seated earlier than expected, but it took us over an hour to get our food after ordering. They did offer us a round of drinks for the wait, but overall thought it was just average overall. A number of the foods on their menu were also unavailable."}
{"text":"Very standard Wisconsin fare, but the decor is really quite unique. There wasn't any detectable smoked salmon in the chowder though. Maybe they're being stingy or the cook was on quaaludes that day"}
{"text":"The one star is for their soft pretzel and wood dragon bar. Other than that - this place is ridiculous. Definitely the worst service in Stoughton. Third time is supposed to be a charm - not this time. Every time we've visited service has been slow to non-existent. The \"Please Seat Yourself\" sign at the entry should also read \"Serve Yourself and Do Your Own Dishes\". There is no waitstaff and we won't be back. This place has potential but if they continue on the path of no customer service they'll unfortunately have an empty place with an \"Out Of Business\" sign instead of the audacious \"Please Seat Yourself\" sign. Allow yourself an extra hour if you boldly go here..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have the cutest bar that looks like a Viking ship, great beer, and awesome food. Definitely try the sriracha chicken bites appetizer and 13 colonies IPA."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and FABULOUS pretzel bread!!  The IPA and wired squirrel were outstanding!"}
{"text":"New brew pub in Stoughton they currently have 3 of their brewed beers on tap. Tried the Nordic Blonde which was a great tasting lighter beer. They have a full Bloody Mary bar available to build it to your own preference. They are still working on getting a full meal menu once their kitchen is fully installed but they have appetizer food like pizzas available. Their staff is very friendly and have a great hand carved wooden bar in the shape of a Viking ship with a smoke blowing dragon at the front.  They have trivia contests on Thurs evenings which I heard can be fun here. They hope to start having live music on the weekends.  There are plenty of large TV screens to watch a wide variety of sports. There is a back room with large sofa chairs and couch for smaller intimate groups."}
{"text":"It's hard to be in a Viking bar with the Packers about to kickoff,  but the atmosphere here makes it worth while.   It's especially nice being one block from the Stoughton Opera House where we are about to see a show 
It's clear this place just opened, pizza and bar snacks are the only eating option...but I give the atmosphere and decor an A+ 
The service is good and a fair amount of wine and beer to choose from, including three beers brewed here."}
{"text":"I've been in here a few times now, and I do really like it! 

Came in on a Friday once for fish. The place was PACKED! There was a long wait, but we found a spot at the bar so it wasn't a big deal. 

We were called up to our table much sooner than what they had estimated, so that was really nice! 

The food was really good. It seemed to take quite a while to come out, but when it did, it was worth the wait. 

The inside of the restaurant is really very cool. It's got a couple different levels, different seating areas, and of course the centerpiece being the Dragon bar. Really well put together."}
