{"text":"Doesn't get much worse than this place! It's typical to hear about people getting shot or robbed at this place.  Best to avoid this bar"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The owners are friendly. The late night weekend crowd is a whole different story. Not my type of scene unless your a youngster. Not for us older people but the afternoon and early evenings are fine"}
{"text":"This is the div3 bar to be at on Saturday night.. Pizza is awesome and $2 coors Kitchen is open late and all the chicks are hot.   Not what i was expecting for a mckeesport bar!  Not feeling southside, id recommend cals as a happy medium with parking!"}
