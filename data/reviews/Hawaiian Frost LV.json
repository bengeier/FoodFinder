{"text":"First visit. Out here in the heat fundraising by washing cars....wall down to get a nice cool treat and what......no open! Says open till 10pm but no one stay i sode and its closed up tight. Sooooo sad. Well wont make this trip again."}
{"text":"Some of the best shaved ice I've had in Vegas. Sad thing is, I pass by almost everyday and they're always closed"}
{"text":"The Tigers blood is soooooooo good! It's coconut strawberry flavoring. I will be coming here more often. Already planning to go back on my day off next week!!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Hawaiian shave ice complete with mochi balls, condensed milk and ice cream.  Even offers sugar free syrup flavors.   Would help if they had a few chairs to sit on.  Shave ice consistency is perfect."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we came across this shave ice place! We've been here a few times already. We love supporting local small businesses. People here are nice and give great customer service. The Hawaiian frost and shave ice are perfect for the crazy summer heat here in Vegas. Also reminds me of a certain shave ice place back home. The ice they use is so soft, how it's supposed to be! Not the typical mainland \"snow cone\" hard ice. If you haven't gone to them yet you need to!! We definitely will be here all the time :)"}
{"text":"I had the strawberry Hawaiian Frost, it was delicious. Very refreshing.   Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"It's only been a week since we've known about this place and we've already been here 4 times! It's conveniently minutes away from our home and such a refreshing treat in this crazy Vegas heat of ours. I've tried a lot of shave ice here in town and never found anything as good as back home on Oahu until now. I may prefer this over Matsumoto's actually - crazy right?! Luckily we've only experienced a wait once here and still, it was only maybe 7-10 minutes with 5 people ahead of us. Pua and Lei are so fast and provide great customer service!   Li Hing Mui shave ice with a scoop of Thrifty's ice cream and condensed milk to top it off is my absolute favorite! Must try! :)"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The small size \"frost\" is served in Dixie cups. It's too sweet and doesn't taste like vanilla. It melts right away and gets super watery. Plus, I got a stomachache after eating this. Do not go there no matter how hot it is. You'll only be left thirsty."}
{"text":"We always drive by this one, and finally decided to try it out - we will definitely be going back! The shave ice is the real deal."}
{"text":"So amazing to have a shave ice place that is actually good!! It's amazing to stop here on the way home and it's always amazing!! We wait in our car because it's hot outside.   I like to get the Tigers blood with the ice cream in the bottom and extra condensed milk! So amazing.   Thanks for the great service and quick shave ice. We will see you soon!!"}
{"text":"Love to get a little dessert, Hawaiian Frost, from Hawaii! Perfect for the summer heat in Las Vegas. Unlike a regular shaved ice stand, they offer Hawaiian Frost, a Hawaiian Dairy Treat that comes in 6 different flavors: Strawberry, Strawberry Banana, Island Coffee, Coconut, Strawberry Vanilla and Honeydew Melon. Our family tried the Strawberry Banana, Strawberry Vanilla and Coconut tonight. All 3 tasted great, I especially loved the Coconut, it had lots of real coconut, filled in every single scoop!  They will be at this location for the rest of this summer and possibly into the Fall too. I am definitely coming back to try the other flavors and buying some to take home!"}
{"text":"I'm from Hawaii so I know how real shave ice should taste and this place is the real deal. I got the large rainbow with ice cream and it was delicious and not overly sweet and the consistency of the ice is perfect. Also tried the Tigers blood flavor which is a coconut strawberry flavor. It had a strong coconut flavor which I didn't like too much but my brother enjoyed it. I didn't have a chance to try the soft serve which I always had back home so I definitely will come back.  The only reason I'm taking off one star is because when we arrived there no staff was visible. The lights were on the bench was out and they looked opened but I couldn't see anyone in there. So after bout 5 minutes went back into my car and called the number listed on Yelp. I spoke to someone on the phone and he said that someone is there and just to knock and they might be closing up earlier because of the weather which was kinda gloomy. And once I hung up and walked back there was an employee there."}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here maybe 3-4 times a week! They have so many flavors to choose from and so many choices to get! They also have Li-Hing Mui which is a PLUS if you're from Hawaii! Conveniently located on the corner of Rainbow/Windmill in the Yellow food truck! You can't miss it!"}
