{"text":"Even though they make a good pizza their customer relations is truly among the worst i have ever encountered.  To give you an idea they had long delays and after over an hour of waiting and promises that it was on the way. Instead of apologizing the manager started to become belingerant . Telling me i am impatient. There are many pizza places in the city and i strongly suggest that you find another place to order from. I am in a retail establishment myself and i were to talk to my customers like that they would also leave."}
{"text":"I moved to St. Laurent 6 years ago, heard of this restaurant from my sister-in-law long before my arrival, have been a fan ever since. My faves are the pizza and submarines (the mamma`s special is the best). I usually call ahead for pickup as I live a few streets over, it is very busy during the lunch & dinner rushes, but have dined there once with great service and happy staff."}
{"text":"Came to Mamma's on the recommendation of some friends. Went on a Wednesday night so not a lot of people there. Ordered the Mamma's special 14\" sub with fries. It was a steak sub with mushrooms and green pepper (ask for no pepperoni). Server was nice and polite. We were 3 people and we all enjoyed our meals and the best part was the dirt cheap menu. Most places charge way more for smaller portions. Its a great new find. They are also know for great pizzas so I'll have to come back and have a taste."}
{"text":"This is my Fav pizza to order. Sadly, very very very sadly, I can no longer order from them as I now reside in  Fabreville.   I almost want to ask them to open near my house and make me partner.   I'm picky when it comes to pizza because there are so many pizza joints out there. At mammas the pizza is outstanding, juicy, yes juicy and loaded with toppings that do not overwhelm you but blend in beautifully together to give you one of the top best pizza's out there. They are not shy with toppings and cheese and the sauce is just right and light , not tomato pastish ( yup, I invent words )  The service is quick and you really get what you pay for. I've tried the sub once and loved it.   Please !!!!!! Open in laval !!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of their pizza for many many years. This isn't your Dominos or Pizza Hut or 2 for 1 cardboard pizza. This is pizza like Mama would make! But wait... she did;)"}
{"text":"I have tried this place 3 times, and each meal was worse than the previous.  Today  I  ordered an omelette. It came with a roll that was freezer to microwave fresh, and still tasted damp. Inedible.  The side salad was drowning in a vinagrette that tasted of chemicals.  The \"mashed\" were not real potatoes, so I took fries instead.. greasy and tasteless.  Definitely a place to avoid if you have hypertension.....they used so much salt that I felt dehydrated for about 24 hours."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery but they made two mistakes on the order. Spoke to Ken to rectify the situation and he blamed me for the error and called me a liar. Ken refused to give us a customer relations discount despite the headache and attitude. Food wasn't worth the pain of dealing with Ken. Should have went with Marathon Greek."}
{"text":"This is my Fast food goto spot.  My regulars are the pizza and souvlaki and for what you pay you can't ask for any more.  I've been ordering here for years and don't really bother ordering anywhere else.  Good prices, fast delivery, and consistent quality for fast food."}
{"text":"Pros:Fast delivery. More toppings than your typical fast food pizzas.  Cons:Pizza crust not strong enough to even hold toppings. Not enough sauce on the pizza. overprice & Expensive for what they offer.  Not impressive and would not recommend."}
