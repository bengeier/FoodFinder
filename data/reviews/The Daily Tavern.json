{"text":"Thumbs up for this newcomer!  Cozy atmosphere and very professional staff.  Great selection of craft beers from east and west coasts.  The white bean and quinoa burger is made in-house and very tasty."}
{"text":"Great vibe inside, nice porch on outside. We came for Sunday brunch. Food was delicious and service was fast and friendly. We had the Southern biscuit and chicken club - so good!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, great service, perfect location. The cheddar biscuits are so yummy they will make even the most hardcore paleo people fall off the wagon. Great beer selection, delicious cocktails. Biggest surprise was the brunch which rivals the best of Charleston. The Cherry on top is the service. Friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. Shout out to Christie! Thanks to Andrew Curry for giving Charlotte a great new place to eat, drink, and chill."}
{"text":"What a great new addition to the dining / imbibing options in Uptown Charlotte! Andrew & Moe aren't very attractive to look at but they sure do know how to run a great show here .. the food is superb & they know how to pour a Guinness® in proper fashion!  Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Walked in were greeted with a smile :-) atmosphere is nice and cute server was great! But we waited on our food for 42 minutes. Kitchen definitely needed to speed it up considering we were the only guests . Paid 30$ for a meal I truly didn't like southern Benedict..but I took it home for my dog:-) hopefully he likes it"}
{"text":"Overall it was a solid experience. Service was above average and the food was good. Menu was plentiful with lots of options to share. We sat at the bar and the atmosphere was laid back. I'll be there again."}
{"text":"We finally got a chance to check this place out on a Thursday night for dinner.  The interior is very cozy and the outdoor patio is super cute!  I had the G Man vodka lime drink and it was delicious and refreshing.  My husband had the Bulleit cocktail and said it was great.  We had some fried pickles to start which were crispy and tasty.  He had the pot pie for dinner and loved it while I had the burger with shoestring fried and it was all wonderful.  Andrew was super friendly, as always.  We will definitely be going back to try some of the other foods and check out the fri/sat night DJs!  Great new gem uptown."}
{"text":"Not sure this place has figured out what it wants to be yet. Very cozy feel and the service was very good. However the food was a bit disappointing. The menu is short and trying to appeal to all kinds which means most will only find a few entrees if interest. I ended up getting the burger which was hearty but lacked any real distinctive taste. Also tried to order the fried pickles but was told they had just run out (on a Friday at 7:30). But upon further discussion found out that mean the chef didn't think they were good enough and was not serving them in this night, so I'll give kudos for that. Ended up being in and out in 30 minutes. I will be back but will also give it some time to see if the place evolves. Given some of the other places this group owns I think this will be a winner but needs to figure out what they want to be."}
{"text":"The Daily was great!! I called ahead for an 8 PM table for 5 on a Friday and they held a table for us no problem on the patio.  Landon was a great server, the food came out quickly, the beer and cocktail selection (we didn't try any wines) was great and their vegetarian options were fantastic. They do a white bean burger and instead of serving it with fries, they automatically serve it with a side of veggies (carrots and cauliflower) because the fries are cooked in animal fat. The burger was great and the consideration of vegetarians was very thoughtful. We'll definitely be back next time we are uptown!"}
{"text":"Really good wings, great Bloody Mary (though different so don't expect ZingZang), and awesome place.  Had a DJ playing music (New Years Day) but it wasn't overly loud nor house music so it was enjoyable.  Everyone that worked there was great and the inside is really comfortable.  Great spot for food and a few drinks.  Only things to consider is that its not a spot for game-watching (TVs are small and few) and the lighting is on the very dim-side, could use turning up a bit.  All in all really enjoyed it though."}
{"text":"The biscuits here are to die for and will make up for the slow service and mediocre other brunch dishes. They are the *best* biscuits I have ever had and the sweet honey butter that comes with them are the perfect accompaniment. I will be back for those biscuits."}
{"text":"Visited this bar after dinner. Had excellent service from our server Sarah. She recommended the \" Old School\" for the men and my friend ordered \"the Daily\" and I had a Goza beer. Loved the atmosphere and appreciated that our server asked our names, invited us back, and truly made the drinks with care. We are looking forward to going back there."}
{"text":"Pros: The wait staff are super nice and laid back.  The beer selection is really extensive, they have cool signature cocktails, but they are all on the sweet side so be prepared for that They allow dogs on the outside patio which now has seats too, so that's been great for us to stop by for a drink or snack while out walking our pup!  Cons: The food can be inconsistent. In the past 5-6 times we have been here, the wings are a staple that we order. I'd say the last 2-3 times they came out in like 3 minutes after we put the order in, and they were cold and had a funky aftertaste? I dunno if maybe a lot of them get cooked at once and they just sit under a warmer? For what they charge for 6-7 wings and garnish, I'd gladly wait the few extra minutes to get them fresh fried?  Aside from the food though, this is definitely a place where you could walk in during the day, have drinks and hang out, and not even realize it's already the evening. Great dive bar vibe, I'd recommend checking it out if you live in the area."}
{"text":"Waited at the bar for a good 10 minutes without anyone approaching me. Then two guys come in and sit next to me and immediately get greeted and get their drink orders taken. I literally had to wave to the bartender to get his attention and ask for a menu. He didn't apologize or seem to care to tend to me. Didn't ask if he could get me a drink, just handed me a menu and walked away. I was so appalled I got up and walked out. Would never step foot in this establishment again. Horrible customer service. Blows me away how unattentive and careless the bartender was especially since he literally makes money off tips. My biggest pet peeve is a server or bartender with a bad attitude or horrible customer service skills since we the customers are the ones giving them money which they live off!"}
{"text":"We came for brunch and had a great time! Whether you sit inside or outside, they have a great atmosphere and TVs. We got avocado toast, breakfast sandwich and white bean and quinoa burger. We really enjoyed sitting outside and watching the World Cup!"}
{"text":"Brand new bar right across from the discovery place in uptown. Super cozy interior, great outdoor space, friendly staff. Their chicken wings were awesome and just the right amount of heat. The Carmel corn was also yummy. My friend had beef jerky and the clams with cheddar biscuits, she was full and happy. Their cocktail list looked interesting, though I stuck to rose,I'll have to come back to try some!"}
{"text":"Stopped in during the Friends of Fourth Ward Garden Tour as they were giving out free nibbles. They also had discounted cocktails-oh my! The location was delightful and I'm excited for the menu. Honestly, I had assumed it was all just beer and wasn't planning on giving it another thought. But when I saw the menu and the patio space... well, let's just say that I'm planning on checking out all of the food items at this point."}
{"text":"I love this place! They are located in the fourth ward uptown, right next to the Discovery Center. They did not skip out on the food or cocktails here! The White Bean & Quinoa Burger was delicious and the bloody mary was the best I've had in Charlotte. The mix is house-made and a bit spicy, but not overdone. They have a couple vegan and vegetarian options available, and plenty of good beers on tap (Deshutes Fresh Squeezed IPA and Birdsong Jalapeño for the win!) as well as some local favs in cans. The atmosphere is dim lit and very tavern-like, but I dig it. Our server was great and very attentive. I can't wait to visit the patio when we go back!"}
{"text":"The owners bring the best ribs in charlotte to the daily.   This corner needed a place with this type of ownership and great service."}
{"text":"My daughter brought us here for Brunch on Father's Day... what a blast. Not only did they have great pub food (I enjoyed both the  in house made beef jerky and tender fall off the bone confit pork ribs with blueberry BBQ sauce) yum...... nice selection of beers (to wash it all down) & tasty cocktails there after but there was more.......something I have not seen b4 but definitely added an enjoyable twist for Father's Day........ they had a drawing of prizes 4 the dad's. I pulled a $20 grift card to OMB.....niceI'll be back....."}
{"text":"Had a delicious brunch this afternoon. Ordered the Southern Benedict and it was absolutely delicious. Who wouldn't love a biscuit topped with fried chicken, an over easy egg and sausage gravy?? They have a good beer selection and cocktail list. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Mama Bear left the cubs back in Cali and headed to North Carolina with my aunt to visit some family. On one of our ventures out, we ended up at The Daily. One of the things that drew me in was the variety in the menu-a nice beer list, cocktails and wine (I don't like being pigeon-holed in terms of my liquor, especially if I'm not craving anything in particular). Walking in, the place is dark and cool (the AC was on blast which was quite refreshing since it was a warm day). It was not very crowded so we were able to sit in a nice booth inside (although there is also seating outside). So, what's good?  Try both of the wings (hot and BBQ-they are delicious, especially if you need something to soak up those beers or cocktails). Try the fried pickles (extra crispy dipped in ranch is pretty cool). Being from the west coast, trying appetizers like fried pickles is a nicety. I also had a salad with strawberries, walnuts, etc. and it was so good. In terms of drinks, my aunt ordered a chocolate cake shot (she threw back three in a row which tells me that they were probably really good!). The Mexican Mocha (a hot cocktail) was quite bitter (if you're looking for sweet, this is not the hot cocktail for you). You can really taste the liquor though, so if you're in to strong, bitter, hot cocktails, this is for you (not so much me...). I ended up ordering a cider which was refreshing on a warm June day in Charlotte and made up for my sweet tooth by ordering the Chocolate Pot for dessert. The cocktails are around $12, but they run daily specials during Happy Hour, so don't forget to ask about it.   Nice vibe, good selection of beverages and appetizers and great service. If you are in Charlotte, check them out.   Tip: there is a parking structure right next to the bar (cost: $3 for first 20 minutes and $3 for each additional 20 minutes, but The Daily does not validate)."}
{"text":"Cozy place with good beer and the food is great as well. Recommend the white bean &. Quinoa burger."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and bar! The patio is amazing when it's nice out and the food and drinks are outstanding. Insider tip, the brunch is delicious and only on the weekends (I had the Southern Benedict and my wife had the breakfast biscuit). The bloody's are also fantastic. It's a little dim inside, but there are plenty of TVs for sports and is a great spot for drinks."}
{"text":"Best and well structured menu in Uptown for every type of diet. The staff is great... Angel is my favorite person in the restaurant he is the best!!!"}
{"text":"The clams may be the best thing on the menu. Warm drinks are great on a cold day. Great location, good drinks and friendly service. Great place to start your night."}
{"text":"This restaurant is terrific!  Every detail of this place is well thought out and done with style and care.  They bring you tap water in chilled green bottles that look like you're drinking Pellegrino.  Each wooden table is simply decorated with a pretty daisy and a mason jar candle.  Just the right blend of rustic and charming.  The bathrooms were immaculate!    They didn't have a lot of beers that we knew of to choose from, so the waiter suggested Palmetto.  They weren't to our liking.  But he was!  He provided terrific service.  He was fast, attentive and friendly.    The menu was rather small, and I didn't see a lot of items That weren't fried, but the prices were fair.  You get a lot of bang for your buck!  I would not hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"Despite a few negatives, i absolutely love this place!  Negatives:  Not a place to watch sports. TVs are tiny. My computer monitor at work is bigger than the TV at the bar. There are others that  are a little bigger. Okay for the casual sports fan.   Really loud if you are over 37 and four months. Acoustics issue i think. Sometimes the bartender can't hear you. Music is great though.   Wings - one sauce to rule them all? It is a good sauce but it tries to be spicy, zesty and yummy.  I can pull that off but the sauce doesn't. Give me a few choices dammit!  Everything else is great. Bartenders are one of the best crews in Uptown which says a lot. Collectively they are smart, professional, knowledgeable, funny and hot.   Strong food options. Really enjoyed the pot pie, gnocchi, oysters and chopped salad over the course of several visits.   Beer selection is excellent and includes many locals. Only tried one of their cocktails. It was good but too sweet for me.   Love The Daily!!"}
{"text":"Love this new place, definitely will be my go to spot for a drink. Their Bloody Mary is by far, the best one that I've had!!"}
{"text":"Hungry for Wings and The Daily didn't disappoint. Also enjoyed their Double Mac Burger. Staff friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"If you want to eat a meal here, do not order the delicious cheddar biscuits first.  Each one weighs about 6-7 lbs and comes with honey butter.  Once you start eating them, you won't have room for much else.    I would recommend starting with the beef jerky, though.  It's a great way to enjoy a snack while you sip on a cocktail. The beef jerky and the white cheddar biscuits were the highlight for me.    The cocktails and wings were fine, but I would come back here for the beef jerky and biscuits, with a couple of drinks."}
{"text":"This bar/restaurant has Character.  Old charm with some cool modern characteristics.  I got the steak which was cooked perfectly and had amazing flavors. Also had the pickled eggs that were yummy."}
