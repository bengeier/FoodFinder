{"text":"They turn more of my orders away than they take.  I guess now they only deliver on Fridays and Saturdays.  Told them I have coupons on multiple orders but when it gets to my door it is always full price.  I've called before at 7:50 and they say they won't take my order because they shut down at 8pm.  Then why does the web site say 9pm.  Good food but I guess they could care less about returning customers.  From now on I won't even bother with them.  Too many other places around."}
{"text":"Great pizza, excellent cheese steaks.  I'd say second best cheese steak I've had outside of Philly, just behind The Philly Way, In Milwaukee. Yeah, they don't have Cheese Wiz, but the bread and the meat are spot on. 

I would give them five stars, but I do have an issue with their delivery. I don't know if I'm just calling too late, or they don't have a driver the whole night, but some nights they don't deliver.  

Also they have some menu options online that are not available at this location.

Update: I gave up on them but I think they might be closed now."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and you gotta try the philly cheese steak deluxe! Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Westshore may have migrated north to Ohio but their customer service skills stayed in Florida.  

Don't get me wrong - fantastic food!...  but I've had issues with my order multiple times now and my recent order where I tried to order online went completely wrong. I was told \"We order differently than the Florida locations\".  Then why allow online ordering?  The order went thru and I received a email confirmation. 

 I'll still recommend it to you but don't order online.  For me,  I'm done patronizing this location. 
Sorry Westshore."}
{"text":"Time to update. Have been going here for 6 months and what started as good customer service has declined to unacceptable customer service. I have story after story, from being scolded for asking for more sauce (one ladle or two), to coupons printed online can't be used here, can't order online for some reason (owner huffing and puffing as she tells me) and then there's last night. I can't use a coupon for my pizza because I'm using a gift certificate??? Huh? It was a normal gift certificate, no restrictions, etc. You know, like a cash gift certificate. The dude was so rude about it! All of the other issues and attitudes have been from the female owner. Guess she's trained her employees well. WE WILL NOT BE BACK! Too bad about their attitude because their pizza and hoagies are awesome. Now what to do about this second gift certificate I have."}
