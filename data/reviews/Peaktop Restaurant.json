{"text":"Peak top is the anchors place at First Markham place. 
They have excellent BBQ , pretty decent Cantonese cuisine ...
But why do the owners have to chase away their clients by Nickel and dime their clients? 

I used to Be a peak top fan because they have good food, and even a good server Patrick,who has since left last year. 

I have been going to peak top since they open at First Markham and even after they renovated. 

The reason why I stopped becoming  their fan was because of the same reason why I will not go back again....I went here on December 11, 2015 to give them another chance :)

Again food is good..a but oily but ok. 

I ordered their flaming oyster with shallot in a foiled package, BBQ pork, Chinese \"hollow\" vegetables with CHINESE chili tofu paste and beef. 
The server came back and said that the \"hollow\" vegetables are not in season, and I could pick other vegetables. So I said okay. The vegetable that I substituted was Chinese lettuce which is cheaper than the \"hollow\" vegetables. The list price for the vegetable and beef was $10.50

When the vegetable plate arrived, it was missing the beef. So the owner guy took it back into the kitchen and it came back with some beef (a bit tough) and overdone vegetables. But I figured that at least they tried. 

The surprise came with the bill. They charged us $13.50 for the beef with vegetables, which was exactly what they used to do - changing prices when they felt like. Previously , if you asked for BBQ meat platter, you could not ask for the combination that you liked, I was told that you have yo lay $4 more. This is not the same practice I other BBQ restaurants.  

One time I went there and asked for the same tea that I always had, I was told that they just changed the policy and If you want to get a different type of tea, you paid more. 
Another time, they ran out of some vegetables and they substituted with vegetables of similar value, I had to pay more, just like this time. 

So NO more peaktop...  Because until they realized that they are no longer a monopoly of the best BBQ, clients don't feel like being manipulated by their DYNAMIC pricing...or just buy the out BBQ and leave their price manipulation to the owner guy, his sister and wife to have fun with! 

Also they NEVER take credit card, ever!  So their greedy owners can keep changing prices, and take all the cash!"}
{"text":"Went to Peaktop on a Wednesday night, early-ish dinner, around 6.30. I was expecting a hole in the wall type of restos since the BF bought me their takeout roasted duck 'lai fun' once, which was delicious and truly authentic. But they had quite a few tables with spacious seating. Spare me, because the English could not be found of the traditional 'lai fun' found in Asia. It's a noodle made of rice flour or tapioca starch, difficult to eat with chopsticks, but that's how you know it's authentic. I haven't found a place in Toronto that says they sell 'lai fun' that is the actual one. 
Back to Wednesday night, we ordered a lai fun (of course), some roasted duck, roasted pork, and a side of veggies. the veggies were flavorful, but the batter to coat the veggies were a little disappointing, nonetheless enjoyed. The roasted duck and pork, delicious as always, and the noodles, top notch. 

Because it was an early Wednesday night, not many customers were there yet so the waiters and waitresses were quite relaxed and welcoming, something more rare at a typical chinese resto. The man behind the counter butchering the roasted duck and pork to order was super friendly as well, and I overheard him making sure a customer was okay with the meats they got to-go and seemed really friendly to the couple of customers that ordered takeouts whilst my time there. I'm pretty sure that's owner attitude right there, and if he is, great. If he isn't, even better.

I'm quite surprised as the low ratings they have here, but honestly if you were a 90's kid like me, or you never really got to know the authentic ingredients they use, one would probably not know how to appreciate them either. I'm glad someone brought me to this gem."}
{"text":"terrible food and dining experience here. 

token chinese restaurant in a non-asian area. located in the plazas outside of vaughan mills shopping mall. 

no competitor in the area so they can get away with serving things that their usual customers of (non chinese background) would have no idea how it should taste.

avoid"}
{"text":"I love their Five assorted BBQ item on rice (\"5 goodies rice\") lunch special on Tuesday. $5.99 only, best value in town, beating a McD combo."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday afternoon for lunch, and we ordered the \"daily specials\". Well guess what, the daily specials do not apply for the weekend - when the menu clearly states \"Monday to Sunday\". Also, why give us the daily special on a weekend if you can't give it to us at that price.

When we got our food, the BBQ meats were extremely small portion. Not only that, the BBQ Roast Pork with Rice did not have ANY vegetables - just rice and meat, very cheap. The BBQ Roast Pork and BBQ Duck were very lean, the duck had almost no meat on it.

We also ordered a plate of vegetables - they tasted fine, but they charged us $11.00 for it.

When it came time to pay, they only take cash and debit. So we paid with debit ... but they wanted the tips in CASH ONLY. Tax evasion anyone?

Considering the quality of the food, the high price for vegetables, and the issues around payment, I say go somewhere else. There are better restaurants - even the BBQ stores in the food court are better!"}
{"text":"It is amazing how bad their food were lol

I don't come to this plaza often, randomly walked in this restaurant because of the mouth watering photos outside. The restaurant is small and cozy. The servers were not very attentive, it was probably because we were 4 young 20 something kids, and the other tables were middle aged or seniors, understandable. 

We got bbq pork(cha-siu), braided e-fu noodle, chicken stuffed with sticky rice and Japanese styled egg tofu.

The bbq pork was the best among the 4 dishes, but not stunning. It tasted like the pork were first steamed and then roasted. Which made the pork quite juicy, but not as flavorful as the ones made with traditional method. 

The braised e-fu noodle was what told us we picked the wrong restaurant. This $9.95(or around that) dish had barely anything other than noodle, not even onions and enough sauce. This dish usually come lots of mushrooms and green peppers or other vegetables. The menu also mentioned mushroom as the ingredient, yes it did had a few pieces of mushrooms, probably 6-7 thin slices. The noodle was bland, dry and very undercooked. We informed the server and she kindly took it back. Few mins later she brings it back, a bit better, but still undercooked and under seasoned.  Ten bucks for a dish I can make better at home is a joke.

As we lower our expectation, the sticky rice stuffed chicken was brought to our table. This dish was not that bad, but we agreed that we can order the chicken and rice separately, since preparing them this was do not improve the taste of this dish in any way. The chicken skin were crispy, the rice were a bit salty. Glad we ordered just half the chicken. 

The last dish, Japanese style egg tofu. At this point we just wanted to get all the food and go to a differ et restaurant afterward. 6 or 8 pieces of deep fried egg tofu, no seasoning or sauce whatsoever, plain battered fried, did not taste anything Japanese in it. I guess they are trying to achieve tempura style tofu. Food court quality...

We had so much food left but no one wanted to pack anything home. The overall experience was 2.5/5, but the food only worth 1/5. No star for that noodle, 0/5. Maybe we didn't order the right food. I don't see myself coming back unless if the food is improved."}
{"text":"1/5* service : Horrible service here from waiter to manager to store owner. Waitress was unprepared for order and seems unknowledgable with anything (including how to write). RUDE, ATTITUDE, and hypocrite with their own words.
4/5* food: Aside from unfriendly staff, I got to say their peaking duck was fairly amazing. Skin was crisp and not fattening. The duck was meaty, juicy and flavorful. This restaurant is on a pricy side yet with this price I think they had the best peaking duck in Markham."}
{"text":"I don't think they worst even a star
I went there for lunch  Friend Order lunch special for 2, the picture menu look really nice and dishes big. Unforturnately, the outcome were surprisely small and rubbish! It charged almost CAD30 included tax in cash! 

I believe most of people go there just one time off! Or you want to see how worst it is, you may try once. I trust, you are just putting you money into garage! 

Not worth even a star! so I put no star!"}
{"text":"Used to come here quite a lot when I was a kid, as my parents were quite fond of the place. It is a testament in itself to see that the restaurant is still around about a decade later, with modern decor that changed with the times. So props for that! 

With that being said, the overall quality has gone down quite a bit over the years. The first thing now my mom tells everyone about the place is that they have the shittiest tea around! They give you a pot for your table, but apparently restaurants that are cheaper have better tea. Not a good start. 

Lunch isn't bad, as there are variety in specials. Unfortunately, the menu is quite confusing in itself. Only certain meals come with a drink, soup, or some veggies, yet they all sit on the same page... How would your customer know which one is which! To top it off, the server was exceptionally rude about it. She spoke to us as if we were stupid, and showed us a photo on the page to show that we didn't get veggies. Uhmm, nothing written on the page and photo is pretty much a poor representation 100% of the time. (We even got the veggies as she was talking to us... That shut her right up!)

Food quality itself is pretty good. Which makes up for the overall, giving it a 2. Quite a poor experience compared to what I remembered as a kid."}
{"text":"My goto places to eat Chinese are at Asian Legend and Congee Queen.  I wanted to try a new place.  Google gave it 3.8/5 stars and facebook 4.9/5.  My fiance and a friend accompanied me on a Sunday afternoon for lunch.  The food at this place has been the worst Chinese food since I've lived here for 18 months.  I can only recall that I ordered rice and an entree of soya chicken and char su pork.  Like a previous reviewer, I didnt find the rice fresh.   The tea was not very good. The chicken and char su were nothing special.  I can't recall my fiancee's or friend's dishes but they agreed that we wouldnt be coming back.  On the plus side, I can say that the wait staff was attentive that day."}
{"text":"We thought, from the reivews, that it's a casual BBQ place, but it's much more than that.  First, the decor is more upscale than a BBQ place, and the menu is much more extensive.  Mostly Hong Kong style Cantonese dishes, even quite a few dessert items. We tried a few dishes at dinner and it's pretty decent.  BBQ ribs and pork is delicious, nice crunchy skin.  We ordered the set menu but was able to substitute an item w/o much fuss. 

Service is really good and accommodating."}
{"text":"Peaktop Restaurant has been a longtime establishment at First Markham Place. It is a typical spot for classic Cantonese cuisine style dishes. 

They have a lot of menu selections to select from, ranging from Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup to BBQ Pork on Rice to Cantonese Chow Mein. The food was very tasty. It was prepared very freshly and came steaming hot to my family. 

The Fried Lobster with Green Onion with E-Fu Noodles were very tasty as the noodles were tossed with the lobster, which was a special touch. The Singapore Fried Vermicelli was very tasty , as there was just enough curry spice towards making the dish very palatable in the mouth. The BBQ was prepared very nicely as it is a step above other typical Chinese BBQ places. 

The decor of the restaurant is very modern in its style with their approach towards a night club/ pub feel for the diners.  The service was very decent as the waiters were very attentive and accommodating to all the request my family had. 

If you are looking for a simple meal with bold flavours, then check out Peaktop Restaurant."}
{"text":"My parents were having lunch here and I decided to join them. They have been here a few times for their BBQ lunch special, which changes daily for $5.99. This is the reason I'm not giving this place a 1 star. They seem to enjoy their meals. Fridays have the liver sausage and BBQ pork with rice and bok choy, I believe. 

I ordered their general tao chicken lunch special that comes with choice of soup, entrée, and spring roll. The  hot and sour soup was alright. Slightly better than what you'd get at T&T. The general tao chicken wasn't breaded, which is what I was hoping for. The flavours were there, but I found the sauce a bit too slimy in texture. Spring roll wasn't that good. It was mostly pastry. I took one bite and set it aside. I got the curry beef lunch special for take out for my sister and I was charged $1 for take out, which seems a little ludicrous to me. There's no way a take out box costs $1. Update: they gave my sister all fat pieces for take out and she didn't eat any. 

When it came time to pay, I didn't have any cash on me and I wanted to treat my parents. They made a huge deal of me wanting to pay by debit. It was screamed across the restaurant to everyone working there. I felt a little awkward. Then someone said I wasn't allowed to pay by debit because I ordered their lunch specials. Then someone else said I was going to be charged an extra amount. Fine. How much was it going to be? By then, my mom was so fed up that she took out her cash. The bill had been adjusted to charge me for a debit transaction. They were going to charge me $2.50! Never have I seen a transaction fee so high. My bill was $41 as it is. I have only been charged a transaction fee when my bill was under $10 and the most I have ever been charged was $0.50. 

Anyway, I felt like this restaurant tried to gauge us at every opportunity possible. Their other lunch specials aren't even that cheap, so I felt a little ripped off leaving this place. Never again."}
{"text":"The place has an amazing service, i was treated really well... The only but is the peaking duck, where they don't slice it i front of you, who knows when the duck was :S.. They have another location in Vaughan and that one is way better"}
{"text":"Went here with a large group for an early Christmas/Holiday dinner.  We got set course duck meal and bunch of dishes to share. The food wasn't too bad it was overall a good experience. A good try but not sure if I will return.

Food: 3/5, the duck was moist but didn't seem like there was enough for everyone. We got two plus 6 extra dishes

Service: 2/5, they didn't come often even though they weren't that busy to refill the wraps and other orders. We started our dinner a bit late and I got this uncomfortable feeling that they wanted us to eat fast and leave. They said there was another reservation but there were multiple empty tables.

Ambience: 3/5, typical Chinese restaurant decor; somewhat claustrophobic with chairs and tables close to each other that you have to squeeze in often for the waiters to pass by.

Price: 3/5, average price; around 20-30 per person. There are cheaper chinese restaurants around if you believe chinese food should be cheaper."}
{"text":"I came here before they made it all modern looking and pretty. That's when they were actually good. They were the go-to place for awesome BBQ pork and roasted duck and chicken and whatever Chinese BBQ you desired. They closed for 2 weeks for renovations and I guess that changed everything else as well.

I honestly couldn't tell you what happened, they are still owned by the same people, same waiters work there, same chef...but somehow the BBQ stuff changed and so did the cooking. 

Everything is greasy and the BBQ pork is overly fat and having dinner there was just not enjoyable anymore. The service was ridiculously slow, yes it was a Friday night but honestly, there is a total of 1 waiter, 1 busboy and the 2 owners helping out. It's not a large space but seriously, I think you need to hire a few more people, at least one more person. 

Our food was so slow. We got one dish and finished and waited for another 15 minutes before receiving the second one. We order 5 dishes...

I didn't enjoy the food that I ate and my favourite pork butt dish, it was 3/4 fat and 1/4 meat...not a good ratio and it was so greasy it made me ill. The usual soup to start only comes if you \"know\" the owner, which we do, but that shouldn't be a condition.

We had come here a year earlier and said that we'd never come back again but we again decided to try and was disappointed yet again. This time for real, never going back."}
{"text":"This place is a shit show. Do not come here on a weekday night (e.g. Tuesday night), because the place will be empty, and the D-class kitchen staff will cook the most atrocious Food Court Style - yes, the food was so bad, the description warrants capitalization - Chinese food, that it'll leave you wondering why how on Earth you paid close to $90 for a four-person meal at a plaza known for decent food at a decent price.

Like OK, I know this is First Markham Place, I'm not expecting Yorkville quality here, but from what we ordered, it's as if they just don't give a fuck about their Tuesday night customers and just gave us what was left over from the day. We asked for golden pork (the meat that has the crispy skin), and they said they don't have any left (because it's 7:45PM in the evening). That's fine, I can look past that, but  when they gave us our other dishes, the dishes were cold and dry!

We ordered black pepper salt shrimp as a dish. They had fried it for so long, the shrimp meat inside tasted like paper. Paper!! If I went to Manchu Wok for black pepper salt shrimp, this is what I would get, but why am I getting this tasteless shrimp from a sit-down restaurant?!

Another thing we ordered was sweet and sour pork. Simple enough. I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong with sweet and sour pork. The pork and the flour they use to make it crispy was good enough. But overall, the dish used a lot of really old oil, so it tasted super greasy and made me super thirsty afterwards.

We also ordered this golden pork, eel, and Chinese mushroom bowl. This dish was so salty. Hey, I get it, Chinese people like their salt, but this time it was to a point where they didn't even measure the amount of soy sauce they put in and just chugged a whole bottle in or something. Yet another dish that made me super thirsty.

One more dish: The Beijing duck. Careful of how much oil they slather on your dish because it will seem as if the Beijing duck is swimming in oil on your dish. Hahah. Yeah, no, it's gross.

Then the rice? Hard and stale. I mean, I didn't mind it because I don't mind my rice a little chewy, but when you can actually taste that it's stale and not boiled to a harder chewier texture, then that's a problem.

All in all, this place is trash. Do not go here. If you want Food Court Style Chinese food, just go to the First Markham Place food court. If you want cheap food, then go to the Chef Wong's next door or something. Or if you want cheap food that has minimal MSG, try The Owl of Minerva."}
{"text":"One of the better chinese restaurants in Toronto. The food is tasty and fresh. The fish is fantastic as is the lobster. The duck is succulent. I highly recommend the peaking duck here. The Peking Duck is probably one of the better that I have eaten in Toronto. They also have a sticky rice fried rice. Normally, I hate sticky rice. But they somehow make this into a fried rice dish which is really good. They also have a lobster fried rice dish which is fantastic. Highly recommend this if they have it. I believe it is one of their specials so they may not always have this meal but if you see it, definitely get it."}
{"text":"Please don't come for afternoon tea. Food quality is horrible. The cook and the servers do not know basic food concept. Even as simple as fried chicken thigh, a normal person can do better than this. Basically you can eat the oily batter and that it. Also, bad attitude from server, rushing customers to take order without giving them enough time to read the menu, but there was only one table in the restaurant. Also, who would bring a spoon for noodle/spaghetti? Duh..... never come back to this restaurant. Total disappointment."}
{"text":"They used to be a decent Chinese restaurant with high quality food, but I'm disappointed to say that I'll NEVER come back again.

Went on a weeknight, ordered two lobsters which was way over cooked making the meat smushed. It seemed like the chef has no idea how to cook a lobster at all, and the dish was not cheap!

The sweet and sour pork was worst than food court quality, pork was not fresh, ingredients were from canned food, portion was way too small for $9.99.

We also order a dish in hot pot with tofu and bbq pork and it was extremely salty. (we drank two pots of hot tea afterwards) 
Lastly, the rice in hot pot with Chinese sausages was just bland. Nothing to see and nothing to taste!

Service was another BIG issue for them, servers with no heart or passion in the food industry. They've got this young woman who truly doesn't want to work, and you can even tell by looking at her face. She would drop food at your table without a smile or care. She even took orders from another table with her back & butt facing those customers while \"serving\" us. She just yelled \"say it!\" (in Chinese) 
I truly believe she is of relations to the restaurant owners, because I would not have hired her in the first place. 

You will definitely be over paying without receiving any quality of food or service. And make sure you bring enough CASH if you do decided to risk your taste bud and frustration, because they don't accept credit cards! (who in this day and age don't accept credit cards?! Do they live on another planet or something?) And if you use debit cards, they charge another 5% on you bill!

I suggest trying any other restaurants in that plaza (First Markham Place), you'll be sorry going in to Peaktop!"}
{"text":"I came here for a family dinner.  A whole table of 10 of old, middle and young.  The servers were friendly and nice to tables of families like ours; I supposed we were their bread-and-butter clienteles.  The many food items we ordered were cooked well.  They tasted authentic Cantonese and delicious.  We didn't order any expensive seafood dishes, yet the servers changed our eating plates mid dinner, as if this table were high rollers.  The portion was decent, so was the services.  

Fair food, fair decoration, fair services and fair prices.  A decent and presentable neighbourhood family restaurant.  Solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"They have updated their menus, the old staff is still there, amazing BBQ duck and pork!  

The suckling Roasted pig is amazing- i always purchase that at this place and the turnout is always a 5 star from everyone. 

I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"If you order BBQ combo, you cannot choose which two items you want. If you want to choose, they ask you to pay an extra $2.  This sounds very cheap.This basically means whatever leftover they have, they give it to you. The food is a bit salty overall. The quality is just OK judging by the Canadian Chinese food standard. 

As they do not accept credit card, I paid by US$. The check is $46 something. I gave them US$60. I had waited for 10 minutes.  The waiter didn't bring my change back. When I reminded the waiter to bring my changes, there were only CAD6 in the plate. I told the waiter the correct change should be CAD$14.  The waiter said because of their currency exchange rate is CAD1 vs US0.95.  What the fork!   The current exchange rate is CAD1 vs US$1.05.  All the places around, if they accept US$, they usually exchange as US$1 vs CAD1. If they told me ahead of time about their unfair exchange rate, I would accept it anyway as I didn't have any Canadian dollars with me. This is suck. They really treat me like a tourist who will never come back."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for almost two years, and have always been very happy. Our order is typical...Peaking Duck, Hot&Sour soup and whatever special our server suggests. The last time was fresh scallops in the shell with XO sauce. Very Good. The service is typical (mediocre) but the manager is a very nice man and always greets us with \"welcome back my friend\". Peaktop is always on the list for my visiting family from Geneva and Philidelphia. Prices are reasonable and food is good! We typically visit the Markham location and are usually the only non-Asian table. We always enjoy, and for the life of me, not sure of the whining from the other reviewers. Reviewed in the Globe and Mail as top Peking Duck."}
{"text":"Peaktop exceeds what one would expect from a typical Chinese restaurant - aside from rude staffs and mediocre foods, there might be a surprise for you to find. 

Let's say... Regardless of how many times or how many staff members you ask, everything you ask for will never make it to your table. except for a piece of plastic you might find in your stir fry."}
{"text":"We have not been here for a while, and didn't feel like going to the food court for lunch. What a refreshing experience.
Their service was very friendly, as they made us feel very welcomed. The deco was thoughtful and nice.
We were very impressed with our food, as it is obvious that their wok were very heated to give them that we'll cooked taste.
We will definitely come back as there are lot of dishes we would like to try. They also make their own desert, which are available for take out."}
{"text":"I came in today with my family and it's will probably be my last time because they won't be around for much longer.  

We came today around 5:30PM and it was near empty (1 other table) .. and became empty as we were leaving (nobody had come in for that hour).  
The thing about this place is .. they seem to want to be a \"jau lau\" like a high-end Chinese banquet restaurant.  & I'm sorry PT but you are not.  

The food here is very mediocre and the food that was done well were disappointing in the portions we were served. 

For example, we ordered the hot pot rice with BBQ ribs and chicken claws .. the rice came out wet.  I cannot, cannot, cannot abide wet rice.  My rice has to be moist and fresh .. wet rice is the biggest asian turn off if you're not looking for actual congee. 

Another example is when we ordered the sweet & sour pork.  It was nicely crisped but I swear I could have finished that dish on my own without any help. 
Like I'm trying to have a family dinner and they're serving like it's for a person who just came out of jail (Chinese reference - somebody who hasn't \"ate\" for a long time). 

The restaurant seemed clean overall and the staff was attentive (but then we were the only table).  

It's a little disappointing because if they only gave a little more attention and effort they would be a lot more successful.

My recommendation is to try the foods along Kennedy Rd esp the restaurant on Hwy7 & Kennedy if you're looking for a Chinese fix (esp dim sum! yum :)"}
