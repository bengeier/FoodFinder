{"text":"We stumbled upon this place as its the exact same place as where mama bear taiwanese cuisine used to be, so we thought to give it a try. The place looks totally different as they renovated. It's basically white inside with some very bright lights, so the decor is nothing to write home about. Service wise they were very attentive. They mainly speak mandarin, and it is mainly cuisine from China. My wife and I ordered two bowls of noodles (beef and beef rib) and a side dish  (I can only describe this as hot pepper popcorn cartilage chicken)  The bowls of noodles were full of noodles and beef, very filling. The side dish was also quite tasty. I wasn't sure what to expect at first, but it was both crunchy and tasty. It was nicely coated and fried and not too oily.  My wife and I have already gone back, and wouldn't hesitate to go back again"}
{"text":"Nothing tastes good..  Lamb skewers had no fat... sauce for the shredded potatoes and hand pulled chicken was bland... food took a long time to come... mantoa was burnt and didn't have any condensed milk even when we asked for it..  Only dish which was reasonable (not amazing, just reasonable - 3 stars  None of our party of 4 will ever return  ~~~~  2 star = wouldn't return even if someone wanted to go  3 star = would return if someone wanted to go, but wouldn't suggest going 4 star = recommend!!! Let's GO!! 5 star = WOW!!!!! Best of the best!! Must try!!! Montreal Schwartz)"}
{"text":"Another Chinese skewer/BBQ place! Located right where Mama Bear Taiwanese used to be. Really good flavour with courteous customer service.  Ordered the beef skewer, chicken cartilage, potato slices, mantou bun and ma la fish.  - Beef skewer: good, not too salty - Chicken cartilage: might be too bony for some, but pretty yummy if you're about it - Potato slices: first time having it, really liked it. Kinda like chips! - Mantou Bun skewer: YESSSS. A little salty but it was delicious - Ma La fish: I've been scarred by super spicy numbing ma la fish before, however they made this dish with just the right amount of spiciness and oh my goodness was the fish tender!  Overall I would definitely come back as I have other things I'd like to try on the menu."}
