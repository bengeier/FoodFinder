{"text":"I've passed this place by many times, always thought it looked very inviting.  Some people said it was '....a BBQ joint...\",or \"...they have bar food...\".   checked out the web site and it was instantly apparent this was no \"bar food joint\".  it was a nice little 15 minute ride out of Euclid down a nice little \"country\" road (Rte. 6 or Chardon Rd.)   It was just what i expected --very homey and inviting, with a kind of hunter's lodge/cabin chic.  Large fireplace, rustic decor.  Came to get a steak or maybe prime rib that looked so good on the menu online, but instead it turned out to be Friday all-you-can-eat beer battered haddock fish fry night.  Best fish fry I ever had !!   The service was great and very friendly.  She was constantly bringing us more fish, too, instead of disappearing like some \"all you can eat\" deals.  i looked around at other diner's plates too, and they looked like really good meals as well.  The drinks, and the after dinner coffee were standout too.  Met Mark the owner.  ( sorry, Mark, i forgot your last name.)  He took over about a year ago and apparently is well on his way to making this place a real upscale gem, although the prices are very reasonable.  There's not many places like this in the area, and we're definitely coming back.  It might even become our \"go to\" place, I think.  I've got to believe some of the negative reviews you may have read are left over from a few years ago under the old manager/owner.  Head out there, let's help this place stay in the area for a long time"}
{"text":"We were really excited with the menu when the owners of Ballantine took over.  The food was good, the service good, the beer list great. Since then it has gone downhill.  It seems to be worse each time we go, and tonight both the food and service was so terrible I'm not sure we'll return.    Our server(s) were unenthusiastic at best.  My fiance was not even asked what he would like to drink, and when we caught the waiter who took our initial drink order as he was walking away, we felt as though we were putting him out.    The food was ... sad.  The \"barbecue sauce\" served alongside my pulled pork sandwich was essentially straight molasses, and entirely un-pourable.  When I tipped the glass bottle to pour it, the congealed mass just made a thud against the top, and two little droplets came out.  Perplexed, I asked if something might be wrong, but our server simply advised us to take the lid off and stir it.  Seemed strange to me, but I did so, and it was still unable to pour.  Nothing like the various (and delicious, I might add) sauces they used to serve.    The walleye sandwich my fiance ordered showed up with two small wilted pieces of iceberg.  Again ... sad.    I am terribly disappointed by this restaurant.  The service and food (and beer selection) has obviously declined, but the prices have not."}
{"text":"We were interested in seeing what changes the new owners had made and had a card for free drinks or appetizer.  Unfortunately dinner was barely worth the effort.  The bar needs serious help - anything beyond beer and wine seems beyond them.  Their Bloody Mary tasted like tomato juice with a little vodka added.  I ordered a Lemon Drop and was served a clear liquid in a shot glass with a wedge of lemon on the rim.  One sip was like drinking lighter fluid.  When I indicated it was not what I was expecting - that I wanted a martini, the waitress apologized and returned with the same shot in a martini glass.  It still tasted like lighter fluid!  Dinner was better, but a long time arriving and $11.95 for a fish sandwich and fries seems a bit much.  So, the bar isn't, the food is average and pricey for that - not likely to return."}
