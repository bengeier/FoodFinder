{"text":"By far my favourite pizza place.  I've introduced a few friends to pizza mamia and everyone loves it."}
{"text":"This is a corner pizza joint with good service and bad ambiance, but more importantly the pizza was terrible. Given the choice between this and frozen pizza, I'd go frozen. It is a very thin, burnt crust, with very few dry toppings on it."}
{"text":"The joint is closed for good - TBH neither the pizza, nor the service was very good.  Cominos Pizza is a much better local, independent pizza joint.  Check it out if you are looking for a good homemade wheel!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the bet pizza I've ever had. The staff is so kind and almost gives you a family feel when you order from there. The home made pizza and sauce is absolutely perfect. I will not order pizza from any where else."}
