{"text":"Great service, drinks and food. Went on a Monday night which meant it was less crowded which was great for a date. Nice relaxing music and dim lighting made for a great time."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Highly recommend. Great staff and  owner! Very accommodating and friendly.  Relaxed, comfortable ambience. Love this place!! A must visit!"}
{"text":"Overall atmosphere was quite pleasant, waitresses were amazing and quite accommodating.  However,

Business Owners ourselves, yesterday we were guests from out of town here in Charlotte, NC for what should have been one of the most happiest days of our children's lives was abruptly interrupted.  Half way through their festivities, the Owner approached several guests with his bad attitude and unacceptable, horrible demeanor.

I approached in an attempt to calm the situation down as quickly as possible yet he continued being extremely confrontational, combative, unprofessional, rude and out right disrespectful, I'd even go so far to state during our event at this establishment, we experienced racial profiling at it's best!  This guy needs anger Management and Customer Service 101 refresher training immediately!

Our children paid in full good money when reserved, did not receive the menu ordered for their venue and this behavior turned the entire event into a horrible experience, one we will never visit this establishment ever again, nor would we recommend to any of our Charlotte friends, family or colleagues."}
{"text":"If you want to feel swanky and sophisticated, this is the place to go!  I've been here about 4 times with various friends, and last night, I went there for a happy hour with a young professionals group.

The atmosphere is definitely the reason to come here vs. other wine bars.  It is chic, it is sophisticated, it all feels so very worldly and I feel like a globe-trotting fashionista (no matter what I'm wearing) whenever I come here.

They have very good apps as well.  I came here one time with my BFF after going to see a play, and we had the Filet Mignon Salad and the Artisan Cheese Selection.  Both were served to us on a piece of slate tile with big chunks of sea salt randomly decorating the edges - very cool presentation!  And the food was good too!

The downside is that the parking can be rather limited.  There is a lot in the back of the building, but it has maybe 20-30 spaces and its for Five Guys and The Wine Loft.  If you come here on a weekend night or a Thursday night, it's really difficult to find a space.  But, hey, it's in Dilworth.  It's hard to find parking at most places in Dilworth."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, wine, and service.  Just please add some bottles of wine under $30, everyone else does!"}
{"text":"So I went here tonight with a friend and we got the daily special which was half off a bottle of wine over a certain price.  We picked a bottle of wine over the minimum price, drank it and then as we asked for our check were told that we had to also buy a food item.  We stated and then confirmed with the menu that this wasn't listed as part of the special.  We were told that this was a \"common problem\" and they were ordering new menus so it didn't keep happening.  So we of course said that we wanted the special that was offered in the current menu, as advertised.  We were told that the owner and \"manager on duty\" wouldn't give us the special without a food item and they could give us something to go.  We were both going to dinner afterward and were actually about to leave aka asking for the check so we didn't want anything to go, just the listed special.  We ended up having to get the cheapest food item on the menu, which was ironically sold out, and just had to buy it without actually receiving anything to just get out of there."}
{"text":"Let's start with decor: it gives me a Manhattan vibe. Music is phenomenal.. Food is delicious.. Drinks were great and bartenders are really nice. Check this place out.. Great vibes!"}
{"text":"Did afterwork drinks with some friends at WL on a Friday night. It was surprisingly luxurious inside and had a large outdoor seating area as well. I had a couple glasses of sauvignon blanc, a mixed drink and shrimp cocktail which were all just ok. Some folks in my group had the gyro, which they seemed to enjoy. It did appear a little understaffed for a Friday night so service was a little tardy for the party at times. But overall I'd say WL is AOK and probably one of the better date spot options in the area."}
{"text":"Great lounge atmosphere. Diverse crowd. Good food menu. Great service by bartenders and servers. Owner is welcoming and accommodating. Place to meet new people"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, amazing atmosphere; best  place to meet with your friends after a long day! The server and owner are very attentive. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This is a good place for a first date or after-work drinks.
The space is quite small, but has a nice ambiance.  Pop/techno music was playing.  There is bar seating and banquette seating plus one bar-height 4-top table.

Food was mediocre and overpriced for what you get.
Wine-by-the-glass list was very small for a \"wine loft\".  Nor did they have food/wine paring suggestions as you may expect from a place focusing on wine.  You'd be better off at Georges Brasserie, which has an extensive by-the-glass selection."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere. Ask for the roasted almonds to compliment the wine. Highly recommend. The bartender had excellent recommendations for the wine selection and the owner treated me like a long lost friend. If you are stopping through Charlotte or have lived here a while, stop in for a good time at The Wine Loft."}
{"text":"Best place for daily drink specials! Great customer customer! Try the baked Brie, it's amazing!!"}
{"text":"I hosted an event here and the owner was extremely rude to me and my invited guest. Showed very little appreciation that I selected his wine bar for my event. I was embarrassed of his behavior and hate that I chose the Wine Loft to host an event for recent transplants to the Charlotte area.  My city has much more to offer to people paying their hard earned money than piss-poor customer service. Very unacceptable and unprofessional, unsure why he is the owner or still in business."}
{"text":"This post is a review for Wine Loft on South Blvd. 

So my Yelp app is taking forever to download, and I'm not sure if it's still the best place to write reviews so I'm going to do it here.  I don't usually do this but I know this is the place for the word to get out and spread so here goes.  
Tonight Chris and I started his weekend bday celebration early by going to Rock Salt for some oysters and beer.  Loved it.  Good food and great service.  We followed by going to Wine Loft on south boulevard because on Thursdays they have half price bottles of wine when you get an appetizer.  A while back I got a bad taste in my mouth because I thought the owner treated his staff poorly.  I feel ashamed that I still went there tonight, but after this evening I will not go there anymore.  The bartenders, always female, are friendly and knowledgeable of their drinks and food.  But the owner is always present and watching their every move.  He once belittled a server for not pushing a certain wine.  We always sit at the bar and get front row seats to him doing this.  I feel he is a womanizing asshole.  He always seems to know one or more of the young women that come in, and have his female staff cater to them while he sits with them.  Tonight a young lady came in and as he was talking to her, a bartender asked the girl if she wanted some water.  The guy threw up his hand and snapped at her.  I thought he was going to hit her, literally.  I left in tears and made Chris close the tab.  This is completely unacceptable.  Treating staff like shit is completely unacceptable.  Period."}
{"text":"We really hoped the Wine Loft was going to be our regular spot, unfortunately we will not return (expiring Groupon/Living Social deal or not)... 

Ambiance: 
Pretty nice but very dark.  We had to use the tea light candle and cell phone light to view the menu (once we received a legible menu).  The stools were half sunken which made it a bit awkward to sit.

Staff/Service:
With the exception of one waitress, most of the staff seemed overworked, unenthusiastic, nonchalant, and verrrry slow.  We waited 20+ minutes for 2 overpriced martinis.  I overheard a gentleman at an adjacent table say he asked 4 times for lemons.  :-\ 

Drinks:
Besides over priced, the blueberry martini was pretty good, whereas the pineapple upside down martini was least to be desired.

Tapas: Pretty good (fortunately our food was fully cooked unlike other reviewers')"}
{"text":"Love the vibe and the small plates and dessert, not to mention the wine! Generous pour of great tasting wines and the Mezza plate (hummus, feta dip, and olives) and raspberry creme brûlée cheesecake were all delicious! Definitely plan to try the bruschetta and a cheese plate next time. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon The Wine Loft one Monday evening and I'm so glad I did! I've been looking for a Wine bar type place that stays open relatively late (why do so many close so early?!). Well, this place definitely delivers. I've only ever been during the week and it hasn't been that crowded (which is perfect). I post up on one of the leather couches and enjoy a glass (or three) of wine. They also have specials each night of the week so check them out! They have nights with half off apps, half off wine, etc. It's a great place to go and hang out, chat and catch up with friends. The staff seem knowledgeable and always willing to help! 

 I've had some of the appetizers, the Mezza plate (olives/hummus/feta dip) and the Caprese salad. Both were good but I though that the Mezza plate could have come with more olives. I also had the chocolate mousse dessert and wow - it was so rich and chocolaty! Yum!! 

Also - if you have any type of groupon/restaurant.com deal, know that these cannot be combined with their daily specials."}
{"text":"Great variety, service and patio! Wine and food selections great, try the smoked salmon flatbread, yum!!"}
{"text":"Great place to unwind after a long day or start the night.  Staff is always super attentive and friendly. Great selection of wines and the food is delicious.  This bar is always a win regardless of the occasion.  Ask for Lauren when you go in, she will ensure a great night!!!"}
{"text":"Seating is comfortable and lounge style.  The wine list is OK, not many high end wines, but still a good selection for most people. I enjoyed the steak salad and the antipasto board for sharing between two people. Service was great. Nice date night."}
{"text":"Not a good place to sit, snack and enjoy a glass of wine.  We sat on the patio, which is steps away from the street and traffic.  Inside is a dark bar, aspiring to look trendy.  The glass of wine we had was undrinkable, the bottle had probably been open too long.  The menu is composed of light fare, which appeared to be a bit creative, however the sampling of cheeses and meats we had was generic and uninspired.  The waitresses were obviously hired to be \"young cuties\", so what is it, a place to get wine or T&A? Not a place for foodies or wine lovers."}
{"text":"Came here for girls night and half off wine (Thursdays). The waitress was excellent at making suggestions and we got a cheese plate! Great place for girls night and drinks will come back again."}
{"text":"Been here twice and will NOT be returning.

The first time was on Valentine's Day, they conveniently decided not to take their Living Social deal on Valentine's Day which was the whole reason my boyfriend and I decided to go there (no where did it say not redeemable on holidays in the fine print of the deal). Still wanting to have a nice, relaxing evening, we decided to stay and have some wine and an appetizer. The baked brie was delicious but it didn't come with nearly enough bread, we asked for more and they charged us .75 extra on our bill without even informing us. First of all, 75 cents? Pathetic. Second of all, just tell us there will be an extra fee.

The final time I went there was on a random Friday evening. Still needing to use my Living Social, my boyfriend and I went to have some wine and another appetizer. This time the service was terrible. One of the waitresses told us to wait while she got us a table, so we did and while we were waiting, another couple walked in and took the last open table that we were supposed to sit at. When the waitress came back we told her what happened and she basically said there was nothing she could do. Yes there is something she could've done, she could've apologized, admitted her mistake and given us some sort of compensation.
So, we wait and wait for another table to open, my boyfriend goes to get us some menus, the same waitress who screwed us on our table takes our drink order while we wait, leaves, brings another table what they asked for, and asks us AGAIN what we wanted to drink because she failed to remember ours. At this point I want to just walk out and forget about the Living Social, but trying to keep cool we stayed. We finally sit down, have our glasses of wine (1 each) and cheese platter appetizer (we were sure not to ask for more bread this time) and our total was $40. I'm sorry, but for two glasses of wine and a cheese platter, $40 is a bit steep, especially when the service is horrendous.

All in all, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY AT THIS PLACE. It's terrible."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for at least a year, but I finally got around to it this week at I was very disappointed by my experience.  

I had not been to a wine bar in Charlotte before, but have lived in Nashville and Orlando where there are numerous wine bars.  I am used to wine bars that offer a staff that is passionate about wine, wine flights or tasting options, a wine selection that I can't find anywhere else, and wine pairings with the food menu.  The Wine Loft did not offer any of this.  

I enjoyed the ambiance of the place.  When I first walked in, I was impressed with the modern and cutting edge decor.  It looked like it belonged in Manhattan.  We wanted to get some dinner and wine, so we sat at the bar. The setting set my expectations high for my experience, or at least comprable to other Wine Bars I enjoyed.  The other seating arrangements are couches with coffee tables,designed to enjoy light appetizers and wine. The server greeted us with a disappointing menu tour.  I hoped she would recommend wines and food options, as well as pairings.  Instead she just told us that if we wanted to buy wine by the bottle, to multiply the price by 4 and that the $5 Martini's on special cannot be used with any coupons.  

I first looked at the food menu to determine what I would want to eat and then pair it with a wine. Prior to coming, I had looked at the menu online and saw quite a few items that would make for a good dinner, but the menu presented was different and offered only two entree type meals.  In addition, the food was between $12-$18.  I assumed that since the food was in that price range, that I would get either a descent portion size or be blown out of the water with the culinary art of the dish.  Also, if the current menu was posted online, I would have suggested to my date that we go there for drinks and share an appetizer before going somewhere else for dinner.  In addition, their website said advertised a Wine Down Wednesday where there would be wine sampling/tasting from 6-8.  This was not the case.  They had $5 Martini's that could only be used if you were not using a discount or restaurant,com gift card.  

We placed our order, and I ordered the pumpkin ravioli (was not on their menu online, plus that is more of a fall dish but I was excited to see it in February) and my date ordered the mediterranean plate (also not on the menu online).  I told the server I was not sure what wine I wanted, hoping she would offer a good pairing for the pumpkin ravioli.  Instead she said okay and didn't return for 5 minutes.  I ordered at Pinor Noir from Chile and my date ordered a domestic beer, even though he wanted to do the $5 Martini's.  They would have made more from us since he ordered a $2 or $3 beer and we would have ordered more than one martini.  

When we received our food, the portions were small and the ravioli was comparable to store bought.  In addition, our food came out rather quickly, leading me to believe that  the labor going into our food was pre-prepared and cooked in a turbo chef.   I felt that my four ravioli's soaked in olive oil  for $15 was way overpriced.  I ended up sharing some of my dates food, which was pretty good but still portions were small.

Our bill came to $42, before tip.  I had purchased a restaurant.com gift card and used that to pay for the first $25.  I was glad to have had the card, because I was very unhappy with a high bill and such low quality food and mediocre service.  Our final bill came out to be $25.  

I would recommend this place if you are looking for a modern, relaxing atmosphere.  If you are a wine-o, don't come in with high expectations.  For those who are average wine drinkers, the prices are good for the wine, but you might want to skip the food. 

For me to give this a higher ranking, the food should match the food prices (whether in quality or portions), the staff needs to be knowledgable and friendly, and the wine offerings should be unique."}
{"text":"Stopped at The Wine Loft on a Sunday night to meet a friend and his wife. The staff was very knowledgable about the wine selection and recommended a great Bordeaux. The owner, Sam, was very friendly and made us feel at home. Definitely coming back for more wine, the ambience, and the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great ambience & wine. The food is tasty& the service is great! The owner Sam was super personable. Definitely a great date spot.  This is a must try in Southend"}
{"text":"I seriously go here for the cheese plate...well, and the wine, but that's a given. I'm serious, their cheese plate is AMAZING!!!! I don't live in Charlotte anymore, but whenever I go there, I go to the Wine Loft for the cheesy goodness. :)"}
{"text":"I've stopped in the Wine Loft a couple times recently and it's a fun place! A great spot for girls night. The staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Good  service. Pretty good specials ( $5 Martinis on Wednesday, $5 House wine on Sundays). Nice dark decor. Cute patio. Only lounge in the Southend area."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Great wine selection. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"The Wine Loft should be the sort of joint my wife and I would embrace - we love wine, and cheese, and tapas... and wine. Did I mention wine? So, why the 3-star review?  Good question. Two reasons:

1. The prices at the Wine Loft are plenty jacked up, for the food and, yes, the wine. It is mostly off-labels I don't recognize and it's hard to walk out of there without dropping some serious cheese... errr... cash.

2. The heavily-accented barflies -- lots of opinions here, and loud, and opinionated, and loudly opinioned... \"Hey, want me to tell you what to buy?\" the guy next to me asks. \"Nah, we're good, thanks pal.\" \"But wait, are you sure, I know my wine, and I know the owner, and yada yada yada...\" I could do without that. And its been that way each of the three times we've visited. Different guy each time, too.

In the end, its decent, and we continue to go back and drop $80 on a bottle of wine and cheese and crackers. I guess that earns me 2-stars for decision making??"}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday night with my husband.  

The food was very good. We ordered meat and cheese plate, caprese salad, and mushroom pastry. Portions were not large but bigger than we expected after reading the reviews.  We also shared 3 glasses of wine.   

Our server was very nice and friendly and informative.  She was able to make suggestions for us and we were quite pleased with the results.  

The atmosphere was neat, the place is quite dark but has a middle eastern feel to it.  You can sit on the couches or at the bar.  

The place got quite crowded around 10.  We met the owner before we left and it was a very pleasant experience all around.   I'd definitely return for a good appetizer and a glass of wine.   Probably not for the super hungry though.   Moderately expensive."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this bar has some great wine selections, and a great look/decor. However, I have gone to this bar several times and there is always a group of 3-4 older (Russian/Romanian) guys who know the owner and act like they own the place, and will grope/hit on/make inappropriate comments to any female that walks in there. 
The wine selection is not worth dealing with these lowlifes, which is why if you are a female looking to get a drink without being groped or catcalled I recommend that you go to another wine bar in South End."}
{"text":"Great variety of wine, albeit quite pricey.  The baked brie with honey was fantastic and a good appetizer to share between 4 people.  Good service with a slightly romantic atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just average wine selection, not worth the price. You can't sit at the tables unless you order food, even if the place is empty. Staff was friendly. It's very dark inside, so a good place for a romantic date but not so much for meeting with friends."}
{"text":"Not bad for a 'franchise' wine bar - patio is cool but overlooking south blvd is not ideal. Staff is attentive and good selection. Nice change of pace for Charlotte from the typical 'bar.'"}
{"text":"Because I live way out in the 'burbs in the Ballantyne area,  I don't get out to SouthEnd or Uptown very often to check out the night-life.  So for my b-day celebration, when I actually had a DD for the evening, I was excited to have an excuse to check out the Wine Loft for the first time. 

We met some friends there after dinner.  I don't recall what time we arrived, but the place was pretty packed.  Our friends had us on the list for table, so for the first 45 mins or an hour, we hung out around the bar area. 

The servers & bartenders were super-friendly and very helpful.   They hustled all night to make sure everyone had beverages.  I felt they really went out of their way to make sure we felt welcomed and valued as guests.  Also, they were good sports for taking pics of our group when we asked.  

After we finally got our table, someone in our group decided to place an order for appetizers. They got 2 or 3 spreads (hummus and some sort of cheese spread along with olives) and pita.  I tasted it and thought the quality & flavor was very good. 

We had a lot of different beverages in our group - with some drinking beer,   some drinking wine, and a couple of shots even. I had a Baby Guinness and thought that it was a generous shot.  The servers were very helpful in making wine suggestions if you saw something on the menu that you weren't sure about.  While the selection of beer & wine was not the most extensive in town, there should be something to please everyone here.  While they may not have the most unique or exotic wine-list, they had some decent selections.

Based on my experience here, I was very impressed  with the Wine Loft.  The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is such a tiny place & easily could be over-crowded at times.   Also, the music was a bit loud at times which  made it somewhat difficult to talk to others in our group... felt like I had to shout to be heard.   But, I would definitely go back - I really like the decor & vibe of the place.  And again, I really felt that we had very good service here!"}
{"text":"One of my girlfriends was having a bad day so we gathered some friends and came to Wine Loft. The exterior seems very casual and low-key as it is located in between Five Guys and Nothing, but Noodles. The interior on the other-hand is much more elegant and upscale. The space is fairly small, but I love the intimate setting. We had a small group and were able to snag the comfy couches! The wine bottles are pretty expensive, but it was half price bottles that night (They have different specials throughout the week). I must warn you that the wine bottles are pretty expensive and are probably not worth the original price tag. You're basically paying for the setting, but we definitely had a good time! I recommend this place after a long day/week. Very relaxed with a touch of class (heyy that sorta rhymed!)."}
{"text":"Great music, selection of small apps and food, amazing wine. Sold! This venue is more of what clt needs - lounges! Nice, romantic atmosphere and the music makes it fun to go with friends too. I helped throw a private event there with their event manager, Tara. She's amazing. She can whip up anything in a week! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for drinks, and it was okay. It's rather sexy inside. LOL. There is a seating area around the bar with comfortable looking chairs and couches. The inside is small. It's also really dark, so hard to read the menu. We ordered the cheese plate which was a decent size and had a good selection of cheese. I still have to try the one in Richmond, and now I have something to compare it to."}
{"text":"A lovely little wine bar - that has a bit more sass to it - than others I've been to. 

I was in Charlotte for work and visited the Wine loft with a friend who lives locally. The neighborhood was great. Super close to downtown and had a lot of little breweries and shops to see.

We planned on only having a few glasses of wine and it turned into 3 bottles and staying until close! 

We stayed with the same bottle - the Rock and Vine cab and it was delicious. It was a great suggestion from our server. 

Although the music got a little loud a few times and had a lot of people singing along we were still able to chat and catch up. 

Towards the end of the night we started to get wine hungry and although the kitchen had just closed they made us a hummus platter, a cheese plate and a delicious pizza! 

The service was phenomenal here. 

Hope to visit the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"YEAH for the Wine Loft - I really like this place. Tuesday night half price bottles, Wednesday nights is ladies night $5 Martinis. 

This place has been on my radar for awhile now I'm\"m glad i finally made the decision to walk in my restaurant.com gift card was a good incentive as well. 

I stopped in with two of my girlfriends for dinner and of course wine they bartenders have a heavy hand which always make me happy the more wine the better and the food was great we shared three plates and had plenty of food left. Mushroom toasts were so yummy. All the bartenders were extremely friendly and helpful. I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Loved our visit here - very intimate and romantic, great service and the food was incredible. Great wine recommendations too - worth the money!"}
{"text":"Hidden wine bar with good atmosphere / not too crowded.

This place is rather hidden in it's current location. Unless you know that it is there, you wouldn't think to just walk in off the street.  Parking is in the back and it is next door to the 5 guys.

Once inside, the atmosphere is trendy/posh with lots of seating and a long bar. The pour is good and they also have a full bar - so this is a good place for your friends who are not wine drinkers when you want to have a glass or two - they can order whatever they'd like.

The mark-up is not crazy expensive on bottles, so you can get a nice cab to share with your friends. All the appetizers were really good. The cheese plate was nice and the oil and sea salt almonds were awesome.

Great off the beaten path place to meet a date or friends and cheers!"}
{"text":"Nice place but small.  Night we were there we had no problem getting a seat at the bar though.  Great wine and beer selection.  Good service.  Will go again."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the hot and cold sentiments about this place. I've been many times and LOVE the ambiance and decor.  The wine bar with small plate menu is great-they have some good deals like wed night $5 Martinis.

It's too bad that you can't always count on a great experience, however.  Sometimes the staff are just rude and snobbish.  Once I had a living social to use at this restaurant (having read the fine print clearly and there were no restrictions on when it could be used) and the bartender told me he \"regretfully couldn't accept it because the owner just decided a few hours ago they wouldn't take any of those tonight\".

It was outrageous-I get the sense that owners/management/staff do what they feel like in the moment.  Just too inconsistent for the prices you pay on the regular.  Unfortunate because I would be a regular otherwise."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a glass of wine and sit and talk to friends. Very nice environment. I'm looking forward to coming here to do a wine tasting one day."}
{"text":"A great place for a meet up/drink/snack or date. Nice bartenders. $5 Martinis on Wednesday. Cocktails are ok, but I wouldn't get then again. Watered-down."}
{"text":"The bartenders were unresponsive and the waitress was very rude. I sat at the bar, in this small establishment, for 20 mins constantly waving at the bartender to place my order and not only did no on make eye contact, they had not even cleared the previous patrons drinks and food plates from the bar. The place was not packed enough to excuse the poor treatment. I am not sure if the lack of customer service is the norm for Wine Loft but after today, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Hmmm. It seems to embody a trendy wine bar, but with a \"almost-clubby\" feel. From the modern decor on the walls, lighting, and seating to the Medieval knight in one corner and a tv in the other corner, the ambiance was such a curious thing! I wouldn't expect a club in that business strip (especially without a dance floor), but at some level it seemed to cater in that direction. With the intimate lighting and space, I imagine jazz music to fit better with the ambiance. 

The servers were friendly. The cheese plate was plentiful and delicious! They have a good selection of wines. 

All-in-all a nice stop for starting a night out. They have a patio facing South Boulevard with about 4 tables (they seem to go quickly). Indoors offers a raised seating area (and can be reserved) and then a few lounge seating areas on the side besides sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Fine, not great. Probably a better deal if you go on a Tuesday (half price bottles) or Wednesday (drink special). Sadly, I was there on a Thursday night. The service was good, but the food prices were way too expensive (cheapest thing was $10 for a bruschetta-no thanks!) The space itself was dark and fairly loud with not a ton of seating, but my group (5 women) made it work. 

The scene there seemed to be a lot of 20-something girls and old dudes trying to buy them drinks. 

Not super interested in coming back, but I wouldn't refuse to go either."}
{"text":"BEWARE: This place has false advertisement. You can't advertise for half price wine and then force guest to order food. 

My fiancé and I had a huge meal and then wanted to try this place out. We sat down and we're greeted quickly by a server that explained the half priced wine was only ok if we got food. The cheapest food item was $11 (outside of my but allergy). I don't want to have to order dessert after just eating. The server explained this rule as not OVER SERVING guest. Really? When two guest order a bottle of wine, that's two glasses a person. I think they are simply trying to keep food cost up so they don't have to have a membership club. Either way there are way to many places in this city that offer half priced wine without stipulations on ordering food. 

GO TO FOXCROFT WINE INSTEAD, TRUST ME!!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars

Nice wine bar option in South End. Good wine selection and knowledgable owner and bar staff. Had a cheese plate.....that was OK. Nothing great. Also tried some other finger foods......OK as well. Prices were a little higher than expected, but good quality nonetheless. I didn't see a whole lot of seating in the place. It is a little dark in there, which is OK, and the bar is small. Not sure what you'd do if the place is full......the patio isn't huge either, not a lot of space to lounge around.

Overall not bad. Wish they could expand their space though......"}
{"text":"First upscale bar/lounge/something I've gotten to go to in Charlotte, and I was pleasantly surprised. Went for a birthday and sat down at one of the very comfy tables, The Wine Loft offers a very upscale, but mellow atmosphere. Something out of the movie Hitch. Definitely a date place.

- Ambiance
Honestly I really liked the place because of this. The room itself is lit dark, with some good electronic music in  the backgroud. The area has just enough space where it's very comfortable to move around, yet small enough to feel very exclusive. The bar is extremely nice and the waiters are very friendly, its a classic place for people to come,  chat, and enjoy a night out.

- Drinks
I'll be totally honestly, I didn't like the wine. The bottles were priced as a wine bar should be, but the wine just didn't give me the impression it was that special (sometimes it tasted a hint like La Finca from trader joes). However, the mixed drinks were very good.  We even started ordering off the menu and giving our waiter (who proclaimed to be a mixologist) our preferences in tastes so they could concoct a random drink based on our likes. All in all, i'll come here for the mixed drinks and not the wine.

Didn't really try the food since we ate before coming here, but definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend on St. Patrick's Day to grab some food and \"pre-game\" before heading over to the Irish bar for the evening.  

I was fortunate enough to have a LivingSocial coupon for $40 worth of food and wine, so I thought we were set.  My friend and I are both wine fans, so I thought this would be a great spot.

Long story short, the food was unmemorable (I think I had a cheese plate), if you wanted \"real\" food you were certainly going to pay for it ($$$) and I don't believe I found a glass of wine for under $9 a glass.  I could be wrong.  I could be cheap.  Not sure.

As far as the staff, the initial male bartender was very friendly, and was pretty open to helping us spend $40 for our coupon.  However, there was a female bartender as well, and she was not pleased with our couponed-meal.  If you've read my reviews before, you know how I feel about properly tipping the staff, no matter your Groupon.  However, this chickadee didn't want to give us a chance, and was pretty rude after delivering our bill.  

Oh well.  I normally love trying artsy-fartsy places, but this place missed the mark with me.  It was neither good nor bad.  The end."}
{"text":"A really romantic atmosphere, with a great selection of wines. The food choices are very limited and come in a tapas style.  The hummus in the Mezza plate is really good. The four sisters Sauvignon Blac is super delicious. A very great intimate date place."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy going to the Wine Loft and have spent much money there in the past, so much so that one day, the owner introduced himself to me and shook my hand.  However, on the weekend of August 8, 2015 I went there with some friends and had a most shockingly unpleasant experience.  It was one of my friend's birthday weekend.  Also, my other friend, a United Nations Diplomat, was visiting from overseas.  We ordered lots of tapas and bottles of wine.  We laughed and talked loudly and freely, as we were out on the patio.  At some point, a man who I recognized as the owner walked up to our table and asked if two empty chairs were being used.  We all said no, and he immediately pulled the chairs away.  I was in the middle of telling a story to my friends, so I just quickly said, \"You're welcome\" and kept telling my story.  The man turns around and hovers over our table to ask me, \"Is there a problem?\"  We all -- perplexed now -- said, no.  Then he says, \"Well, you seem sort of tense; is there a problem?\" We said no again.  Then he turns around to put the chairs at another table, and I held my hands out and said to my friends, \"All I said was 'you're welcome.'  That's when the owner turned around again and said, \"But I DIDN'T say thank you.\"  It was so shockingly rude, and by now nearby customers were all staring, that all I could think to say to deflate the situation was, \"Well, you're STILL welcome.\"  I honestly thought he had said thank you.  I guess he really wanted me to know that, as the owner, he didn't have to say thank you.  To deescalate things more, I said, \"I know you're the owner; I've even met you before.\"  And that's when, with an angry scowl on his face, he hovered over our table again and replied, \"Then you ought to know that I don't have time to deal with attitude from people like you.\"  I was blown away.  Other customers were just staring with mouths open.  That's when I told him that he was \"f-ing\" with the wrong person.  He came back over to our table and loudly scraped other chairs across the pavement and said, \"Get out! I want you all to leave NOW!\"  We finished our wine and left.  I will never spend my money there ever again.  EVER!  And Trip Advisor as well as all my worldly connects will hear about this, too."}
{"text":"Great vibe! Staff is excellent! Great recommendations on both drinks and food! 
Couldn't ask for a better chill wine/cocktail spot! 
Thanks The Wine Loft!!!"}
{"text":"Place was nice like always. drinks and deserts was good. i went on half price bottle night so the price weren't bad. but all the tables were \"reserved\" so we were forced to seat at the bar almost at 11pm, it wasn't very comfortable at the bar for me."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to this hidden wine bar, you are severely missing out! Half off Tuesday Appetizers? $5 Martinis all night on Wednesdays? Seriously, what have you been doing with your life?
The Wine Loft is located across from the Atherton Mill in Southend. Don't let neighboring businesses such as Five Guys or Chipotle dissuade you from stopping in. The bartenders are extremely knowledgable and friendly, and they offer a very happy pour for Happy Hour!
I love the charcuterie board or the antipasto board. Perfect place for a Happy Hour with the girls or a little date night! Parking is available hidden in the back as well."}
{"text":"Decent wine selection, the food is amazing, fantastic atmosphere.   Perfect date spot!

Sunday and Monday's are Bottle of Wine, Appetizer and Dessert for I believe 40 bucks.
Wednesday's are $5.00 Martinis.

Highly recommend!  No complaints whatsoever!"}
{"text":"This is a really good place for a celebration or a date night. There's a little area for private parties, tapas style food, and candle light throughout the bar.. Definitely a place for classy people. The music is sexy and the service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Loved the vibe. Low lighting, great wine, and comfy seating. The staff was all personable and very helpful.  Definitely a great date night spot in charlotte."}
{"text":"Just OK, nothing remarkable. Contemporary decor creates a trendy look. Wine prices are on the high side. First try at ordering a bottle of wine was met with an apologetic \"we ran out\". Had a nice Washington Riesling for $40. Antipasto platter was worth the $15. Service was friendly, piped in music could be a tad lower.
You should try this place to decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Great relaxing atmosphere... Nice patio too.... Lauren and Tara will take great care of you behind the bar!"}
{"text":"This spot is super sexy! Great for 30 somethings! Those who want a chill place to have a few drinks, and still be able to have a conversation. My absolute favorite bartender works there now too! His name is Chris! *tell him I sent ya ;) * The food is pretty good too! I had the Steak Gyro, which was quite tasty! My friend had the pumpkin ravioli, which was good...we just didn't need a whole bowl of it. But we enjoyed the evening tremendously! I'll definitely be back in soon! Hopefully on a date! LOL ;)"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years and wanted to come here for some drinks and food. The kitchen was closed when we arrived, which sucked, but the drinks we ordered were great. The bartender offered great suggestions!"}
{"text":"I visited this location on May 24, 2013 with my friend on a bon voyage night.  The food was good.  The drinks were just right; its very rare you go to a place and the drinks are not water down.  I was happy with the fact I recieved a real drink.  Atmosphere is good.  The one thing I would change is more space.  Overall we plan to go back."}
{"text":"Great wine! Great location! Very friendly service... My first time here... Its very clean.. I do recommend this place to anyone who wants to go out and relax... To get a piece of mind with friends or just to mingle"}
{"text":"Place - nice ambiance, good music to vibe to. Upbeat and a mix of pop mixed house music.

Drinks - majorly expensive :( Shots $10, glass of wines $10-11 (but I guess that is normal?)

Service - decent and nice.

Went for a friends bday bash, it was great with group of people there. Just too darn expensive, my pocketbook hurt that night. Would I go back, meh. There are other hot spots that are much more affordable and better."}
{"text":"So sad.

I flew into CLT and went out of my way to give this place a try. I found my way to the parking lot at  just 10:30. (it's easy to miss the place - next to 5 Guys) I simply wanted to grab a glass of wine and a snack and check place out. 

Upon seeing me pull in, and while I was headed to the door, someone inside walked up and locked it. Thinking I was mistaken or that the hours on yelp were wrong, I called the place only to get the automated message... confirming that they are opened until 11:00 on Sundays.  

I was quite disappointed, after navigating through the city to find this place, to be brushed off. 

Boo...."}
{"text":"First night in Charlotte and what a find!  Service great, treated special, food was delicious and our martinis were yummy and strong!  Would come back again if ever in Charlotte.  Had a decent wine selection and good selection of small and large bites.  The charcuterie board was the best.  

Would highly recommend!  Loved it!"}
{"text":"I've only actually been here once because the other two times I've tried to go it was so crowded there was literally no where to sit or stand. The atmosphere is a little weird to me, but maybe that's just my personal taste. There was nothing particularly special about the wine, food, or service. Wish I could give a better review because I love wine and small bites places, but wasn't particularly impressed here."}
{"text":"We have visited this place in the past and really enjoyed it. We have brought our out of town business visitors there because of the unusual, eclectic decor. We enjoyed the food so much in the past it makes me sorry to write this review. I believe some of the photos on yelp are from one of our happier visits.

Although we find the wines a bit pricey, we have always enjoyed the funky club atmosphere.  We returned last night for a pre-anniversary stop for wine and apps. Unfortunately, our experience was so bad, I doubt we'll be back. 

Our food came out so undercooked, I'd bet one of the dishes never made it to the oven. The cheese wasn't  melted and the mushrooms were cold. The other app was just so so. it's hard to believe the bartender would even serve something that clearly didn't look cooked.

To make matters worse, we feel sure either an owner or manager was sitting opposite us at the bar working on a laptop. it may be helpful for him to walk around and meet his clientele, ask how everything is/was. 

The worst turnoff was the restrooms, both of them were so filthy we almost lost our desire to dine there. it seems that a place as nice as the Wine Loft with wine priced at $70 and up per bottle can do better."}
{"text":"SOooooo disappointed! Enjoyed every restaurant/lounge/bar I visited while in Charlotte with the exception of this place. It's obvious that some of the reviews were left by people who are friends with the owner. I'm not even sure why this is called a \"wine loft\" to be honest. I will not be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a 5 star place! Best service I got in so long and it was really unexpected. The place was a little hard to find. I found it on Yelp by the way. Once I walked in the Wine aloft I was amazed about the decoration. It's on point! Modern, warm and classy. I went there with coworkers to celebrate my promotion and our experience was nothing short of incredible. The staff was very friendly. They over heard about the special occasion and surprised us with glasses of bubbly wine. That really made the difference. We also had a couple of bottles of wine suggested by the bartender Tara and everything tasted delightful. Tara made our experience particularly more special by being so personable and accommodating. We can not wait to be back. I will definitely recommend this place for anyone trying to have a more private get together in a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here for a low key girls night and had an awesome time. Nice ambience and great service. We received complimentary champagne at the end of the night. We will return. Get one of the wine flights they are really good portions."}
{"text":"Popped in for a bit and some vino on date night recently and instantly impressed with the decor first and foremost.  Very trendy and chic place with nice seating like love seats and leather sofas so that you can really unwind.  I love that.

The service was as ok.  I probably would have been blown away if the service was able to keep up.  I think it was just a night they were short handed, maybe from an employee not showing up.  The owner was there and even pitched in to keep things moving, so that was impressive.

I'll be back for sure and give this place another solid shot and impressing me a little more and if the weather is good give the patio a test drive."}
{"text":"The owner of this establishment spent the entirety of 2 hours sexually harassing me while I was trying to organize and host an event for the firm I work for. He offered me food when I arrived - which was delicious - but then \"joked\" (more like threatened) that he roofied the food I had just eaten. He berated me for not accepting his offer for a free alcoholic beverage (I don't drink at work events). He, upon finding out that I was a lesbian (via intrusive questions about my engagement ring and \"husband\") asked me 3 or 4 times which one of his bartenders I would like to have sex with, accompanying his gross and objectifying sentiments with deeply personal information about each one of them. He sent me text messages reading \"you better come back!\" when I went to the restroom. He slapped my butt as I walked by him. He relentlessly commented on my appearance and at one point, quickly took my shoes off while I was sitting in a barstool to \"admire\" my feet. GROSS. He couldn't keep the conversation from going sexual, even as I tried to continue to organize the event for the guests that were about to arrive. I left the place sobbing and had to have another event manager take over for me. If you're considering hosting an event here, don't. The owner is a rapey piece of trash and even though he might \"shut down the restaurant for you\" (as he proceeded to do for us), it comes at a price."}
{"text":"Chic and modern decor, with a worldly and dark vibe that is a perfect nook for some low profile gatherings for either couples or slightly larger parties.  Sadly, though, this place strays from greatness with their rather limited wine selection and a minimal, safe food selection.

I stopped in last weekend with the wife and another couple friend for the specific purpose of having some good wine and conversation.  We grabbed a nice corner of couches that was perfect for the purpose of the evening.  The lighting was pretty dark, save for the lit candle centerpieces on the tables.  Candles should make a serious comeback- perfect mood lighting that gets lost with larger scale dining rooms.  Points to Wine Loft for this.

However, irony starts to set in when you go to look at the wine list offered by \"Wine Loft.\"  All the basics are covered here: chard, zin, cab, and sparkling, but the options are all safe plays- well-known brands find their way onto and all over the menu.  Nothing exciting, nothing new and tempting.  On top of that, I brought a couple bottles of my own wine and asked if they could open and pour with an appropriate corkage fee- common at most restaurants.  No dice!  The server said they flat out don't allow outside bottles into Wine Loft.  I get it- they want to see you buy their stuff, but you can kiss the die-hard wine community buh-bye with this policy.  

The other thing I questioned is their price by the glass vs. price by the bottle option.  Basically, all their wines are served by the glass and if you want a bottle just multiply that price x4.  That's the usual number of glasses one should get from a bottle, but that just reinforces the idea that all the wine choices here are safe bets- nothing special.  Nothing rare or interesting enough you would only sell it by the bottle (and command the typical premium for this).  This misses the mark in a wine bar that otherwise is designed for and has the execution to attract an upper end of the market.

We did have a couple artisan cheese plates, which were served with a decent portion of 3 different cheese and a number of crackers, fruit slices, and some almonds.  No problem here, but again, the cheese selections were all safe and borderline \"artisan.\"  There was a gorgonzola, a brie, and two others that obviously didn't register enough with me.  No options to craft your own mix of cheeses, no note of who actually made those cheeses or where they come from.  Yep, nice and safe again.

There are a handful of other appetizer-type choices on the menu and a couple desserts.  I can't speak to those other than to say that I'd not try to make dinner out of them.  All starters or finishers, at best.

I'd go back just for the ambiance this place exudes, but I'd definitely plan to eat elsewhere and I'd not go here again with the idea to really drink some serious wine.  Maybe this is a good place to meet up, have a first drink, and then head out elsewhere?  That's the most you'll get from me when you stick to playing it safe."}
{"text":"Visited this place for drinks on a Saturday evening around 6pm and it was pretty much empty.  It is a very cute, trendy type place, that is perfect for a date night.  We ordered 2 drinks total and our bill was almost $34!  These were simple cocktails with just one shot of rum, a little orange juice, and grenadine...I couldn't believe how expensive the drinks were.  This is probably the main reason that I would not return or recommend this place to a friend.  The trendy vibe is not enough to pay about $16 for a simple cocktail!"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING!

I have been vomiting for the past 24 hours thanks to this place. Makes sense after reading other reviews about undercooked food, etc. Also, I saw the owner or manager (an older man probably 50s) grope two young female employees, on two separate occasions, clearly inappropriate and gross misconduct right in the middle of the restaurant! 

So it doesn't necessarily surprise me that a looseness with morality would expand to a looseness in food safety standards."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, it has a very trendy and metropolitan vibe. Wine selection isn't as vast as some of the other wine bars but the atmosphere really makes up for that. They also have beer and liquor if you have people in your group who don't drink wine. I have only had the cheesecake here but it's good. The other food looks good as well."}
{"text":"Good wine. Good martinis. Good antipasto meat and cheese board. Bartenders were nice. Would def come back. No complaints. Super chill. Think NYC wine bar on the more chill side. Love it. Great for first date as you can always eat or just grab a drink!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  great drinks. The food is pretty good too. A bit on the pricy side,  so if you're pulling an all nighter I wouldn't stay there long. But it's a great starting point."}
{"text":"If it was possible to give this place more stars, I would. I went here to meet a friend last night (Friday) upon their suggestion and I am pretty sure this is the best spot I have been to in South End - and possibly Charlotte - since I've been here. The servers/bartenders are beautiful and incredibly friendly, they treat you like you are being hosted as a guest at their home rather than at a restaurant. The music is excellent and a perfect volume, so you can hear it but are at no point screaming over it. I had wine (predictably at the Wine Loft) which the server helped me select and it was excellent, my friend also very much enjoyed his Mixed drinks. We didn't eat, but the people at the table next to us were excitedly discussing how delicious their food was. Even the owner came by to say hello and was extremely welcoming and polite! A much different scene than the snooty uptown/south end treatment of customers. I already can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this wine bar. Came in on a Monday night with a friend and the ambiance is perfect - small, dimmed lighting, and plenty of great seating options ideal for conversation. I also enjoyed the music selection but not sure why they had it so loud, especially since there were only about 8 people in the bar. We didn't try any of the food but the wines by the glass were good and reasonably priced for this setting."}
{"text":"Sweet... this place surprised me on the inside.  From the outside, it looks like an un-assuming little place next to the Lowe's and Five Guys, but it does have a cool vibe to it once you go in.

Stopped by on a Saturday night and it was pretty busy, there were a couple of groups eating dinner(?).   The reason for the question mark is that their plates were wiped clean of food... I guess that means it was good.

Our group of friends was large enough to occupy the \"reserved\" area in the front that steps up.  It was nice just lounging and enjoying a couple of bottles of wine.  After the sun went down, the place got pretty dim inside and really reminded me of something you would see in Vegas.  The bathrooms are super clean (also dark)... I don't recall seeing a black toilet with so much water pressure in my life - also could have been the wine, but still.

Definitely have to come back and sample more bottles."}
{"text":"Went here for a first date a few weeks ago. Great spot! Very classy with nice ambiance. Loved the decor and the intimate setting. We sat at the bar but the tables looked nice! I've been meaning to go back and try the food bc it also looked delicious."}
{"text":"It's a nice little place & the background music was chill, but as a lot of the wine bars around are - a bit pricy.  4 glasses will set you back $50 bucks so you might as well go with the bottle.  The food smells good & looks good, but we haven't tried any.  We've been there a couple of times, but if it's not your neighborhood it isn't worth the drive unless there having a 1/2 price night but I don't know when that might be."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere. It's great for date night. My boyfriend and I love coming here. We have even gone on double dates here. This is our favorite wine bar so far in charlotte."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to find a good wine bar in the area, but so disappointed in the wine we ended up getting! Came here with a group and we were immediately seated by a server in a cozy corner of the restaurant. I got a flight of red wine but was disappointed to find out that we weren't allowed to select our flight and had to go along with the pre-selected wines! Not that big of a deal I suppose... but the wines we got were bad! They tasted very cheap and a little like grape juice. Wish we had gotten better options."}
{"text":"If there was a lesser rating than 1*, this place deserves it. It was the second trrip for one couple and a third for another.  None of us will go back again. And probably even with this review, management/ownership will not care. 

From previous trips and present, the owner has favorites that he caters to and only cares about. The two servers/bartenders were working, although slowly, to wait tables and tend bar and the manager/owner stood around on his phone emailing or texting, oblivious to any other needs except those he deemed worthy. We had four people with two bottles of wine and he never acknowledged us at all.

Even with an un-crowded night, we waited at least 20 minutes for our drink orders to be taken. A party of 12 came in after us and was being served before our drink orders were even taken. 

From top to bottom, this place needs some education in customer service."}
{"text":"So nice to have a little wine spot in the neighborhood.  Unassuming but a nice place.  We had the meat/cheese plate and a nice little bottle of wine.  Little pricey but if you want something different than a bottle at home, this is a good alternative."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here before hitting the town with some friends the other night. We had some time to kill before meeting with out friends so looked up a wine bar and was brought to this place. We must admit that were were thoroughly impressed. My wife and I did not have any of the food here, but we did think it looked quite nice from what we saw of it, but we did experience the service and the wine.

First off, there is one down side to this place potentially, the parking. We did not have any issues finding a spot, but the parking does seem like it is very little considering that they share a lot with at least 2 other restaurants. 

When we first arrived we were pleasantly greeted by the bartenders that were there. We loved the atmosphere as we came in. The place has lots of couch seating and was very romantically lite. The wife and I started to look for a place to sit because the place was quite crowded, however, one of the bar tenders approached us and asked if we would like to sit at the bar and made room for us to site there. We were then handed menus. After looking at the menu, both my wife and I ordered glasses of wine, she the Tempranillo wine and I the Coastal Vines Cabernet. When the bartender delivered our wines we were both also provided with a glass of water which was quite pleasant since my wife and I like to try each other wines when we get different ones. After we tried each others we both liked our wines but decided that I had selected the superior wine. I high recommend the Coastal Vines now. Through our evening there the service was prompt and we really enjoyed our time at the Wine Loft. I highly suggest it to anyone that loves good wine and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere. The bartenders are always friendly and attentive. Drink specials during the week are great, on the weekends it's pretty pricey, but they have a great selection of wine. They have basic food offerings - nice stuff, but pretty fun of the mill. 

Their specialty martinis range from stiff traditional drinks to sweet and fruity. It doesn't seem like you can get a great hand crafted cocktail, but their specialty is wine. 

Overall, I'd go for happy hour, but for me, it's not a destination spot for dinner or an evening out."}
{"text":"First time here. It's a little hidden. Decor is nice. They are a little pricey for drinks. I got a Malibu bay breeze and it was $15!! It's usually $5-7 anywhere else. My fiancé got a bottle of wine and he said it wasn't that great and it was expensive for what it was especially with it being a twist top bottle."}
{"text":"Well color me impressed! I didn't really have super high expectations for Wine Loft, but I left quite happy and full of prosecco goodness.

The interior of Wine Loft is dark, shiny and kind of sex-ay. You'll find a nice lounging area to the right as you walk in and a nice variety of tables and couches throughout the rest of this cozy wine bar. Service was solid and our bartender was friendly and on top of our drink orders. The menu offers a nice variety of affordable wines by the glass and bottle, a  nice martini list and an array of small bites that looked pretty tasty. 

Our group sipped on a bottle of Perfecto Prosecco ($36) and enjoyed the low key ambiance with plenty of shiny tiles overhead and glowing candles. For a low key glass of vino, definitely check out Wine Loft!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday party, my husband and I got two mixed drinks and two low end beers and paid $60.  Our mixed drinks alone were 20/each which is absurd for house liquor for a negroni and the same thing with bourbon instead of gin. Have fun spending way more money than anywhere else where you could easily have a better atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went with a friend recently and had no expectations one way or the other upon arrival. I knew - literally - nothing about the place. We gave the menu on the window a once-over before entering and the manager came out to invite us in - I like that kind of hospitality.

The interior is dark with lushly-upholstered lounges, dark wood, wrought iron, and sliver and gold accents. It has a very alluring, adult appeal that a lot of places shoot for and miss completely. It was on the crowded side so we pulled up a few stools at the bar.

They have a fairly large wine list, priced like you would expect to find in a by-the-glass establishment. The expected is there, as well as a few hidden gems if you look hard. The beer assortment is thin, just enough to satisfy the beer drinker, and they also have a cocktail list. The mixed drinks are prepared fairly well and were nicely balanced. Wine pours were not on the skimpy side, either.

It seemed, though, that the entire staff that night was hired based on being young, fit and blonde than on knowing anything about wine. These ladies were incredibly kind and hard working- don't get me wrong. I just question the owner's motives behind that decision and the kind of crowd he hopes to attract."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had. My friend and I visited for my birthday. Service was decent up until the end when I asked for the check. The server assumed I had a living social without me mentioning it. (I did have one that was gifted to me from my sister for my birthday). She told me the bill would be different because she needed to add gratuity. I thought that was weird considering I had once worked at a nice restaurant that had also done living social but would never add gratuity based on that alone. I said ok but asked what amount the gratuity was. She stated 15% and that \"it was in the fine print and standard procedure for them.\" I said \"ok but I would like to see the total amount before the discount because I usually tip 20%\". She stated \"ok. I can remove the gratuity if you'd like.\" I thought that was strange since she just gave a short monologue about it being \"standard procedure\" for them to add the 18% for living socials. I stated \"It doesn't matter. I'll leave 20% regardless. I just want to know the total.\" She proceeds to remove the gratuity and gives me the new bill with the living social discount. Then she tells me \"I have full confidence you will tip 20% now that I've removed the gratuity.\" I could not let the tackiness continue. I just had a bill of $90 for three previously frozen cheese dishes to have a bartender racially profile and talk condescendingly to me and my friend! I told her that she was out of line and that I thought it was disrespectful and inappropriate to say what she had said. The owner (who was standing near her the entire time) steps in at this point and says \"we aren't targeting you specifically\" WHAT. THE. EFF. So I tell her, \"I have worked in the service industry for ten years and would NEVER think to say anything remotely close to what she has said to me. I will still tip you the 20% because I said I would but this is really outrageous and rude.\" The owner interjected again at this point and says \"that was rude. Youre fired!\" The server looks terrified and says \"are you serious??\" He owner says \"im kidding. Just trying to make this situation lighter.\" My (white) friend tells the owner that \"that's not cool. And there was a better way to handle this.\" The owner gets pissed and yells \"are you trying to tell me how to handle my business?\" At this point, the owner has proven he is probably mentally unstable but definitely incapable of handling poor customer service. I just get my bill, pay the undeserved 20% tip (as I said I would) and left. 

This place is a disaster. Please avoid this place. I wish I could give it a zero rating. There are other wine bars close enough that are so much better. Fidelli kitchen is a top one that comes to mind."}
{"text":"Very tiny, trendy, wine spot - went there one night with my boyfriend and we just had wine (2 bottles) but we had a great time.  The service was awesome and very friendly.  Wine was moderately priced - not the best selection but a little of everything."}
{"text":"Liked the kobe sliders. Liked the kobe salad. Liked the cheese plate.

Pass on the chocolate lava cake.

Everything was reasonably priced. This place is a dimly lit little place sandwiched next to a Noodles and Co. Despite this, there was a great atmosphere, and hot bartender. I do wish they had more dessert wine options."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Saturday evening.  It was over Labor Day weekend so we had the place to ourselves. I started with a glass of moscato and he had a glass of Reisling.  Both were pretty tasty.  We chose the antipasto board which came with 3 kinds of meats and 2 types of cheese, the pumpkin ravioli and the Authentic Hummus Platter.  It was more than enough food but it was all delicious.  Since this was our first time visiting Charlotte, I went to Restaurant.com and picked up a gift certificate for the restaurant.  I'm so glad I picked this restaurant.  The bartenders were friendly and filled us in on the local scenes which was really helpful.  

The atmosphere is sexy.  The music and lighting just makes the place.  When we come back for another visit we will definitely be coming back to the Wine Loft!"}
{"text":"Meh.....is how I felt about this place.  Here's why.  

1.  Walked in through the back entrance and thought I had walked into a Hookah bar.  Huh? Where are we??  I thought this was a wine loft lounge.

2.  What's with the loud trance dance music??  \"WHAT??  Excuse me, WHAT??  I can't hear you over this loud dance music\"  It would have made sense if there was a dance floor.  omg..I'm old and now my head hurts from the music...or it is the wine?

3.  I felt like the staff was nice, but not helpful when they lost a friends credit card.  What in thee whirl??  How does that happen?  Maybe if you'd chill-out the music some, you would have heard your own thoughts and been able to concentrate more.  Granted we were a large party...but we were the ONLY large party in there.  

I dunno...maybe they turn up the music the later it gets on Fridays and Saturdays. Not what I expected.  At.All.  Wine prices were...I dunno...a bit pricey.  I think I'm almost done w/ buying wines by the glass...the mark up is crazy in some places.  (This being one of them) You'd be better off splitting a nicely marked up bottle of wine with others just to break even on cost. (Gosh I sound cheap.  but I'm not....promise.) Probably won't be back...

The end....."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Usually it is full of stuck up people. The drinks are rather pricey. The waitresses are never really very friendly, maybe once in a blue moon. Last night I went for NYE and it was decorated very nicely. Everyone was pretty nice. May come back, don't know. Nothing thrilling."}
{"text":"I tried it and once again wasn't disappointed although this time I noticed something I didn't the first time. I did a girls night out with my neighbor who didn't have the best time the first time she came here but I assured her that it really was a nice place to go and relax with a great glass of vino fino! Well she agreed to go and we both had a great time catching up in this laid back and relaxing atmosphere. There are plenty of outdoor seats and indoor tables and chairs but we hung out on one of the comfy sofas. We had a great time catching up but I noticed something I hadn't before on my earlier trips. When I got home I sat down to check my emails before changing clothes and soon I noticed that I reeked of the smell of grease. I had to immediately put all my clothes in the washer. I had noticed when I was there that I was stuffed up and thought it was allergies. Now I know it was the air in the place. Although not noticed when there, the place needs a good airing out or a filter change. I love this place and will gladly return but hope that next time I will be able to breathe again."}
{"text":"I ordered quite a few things from this place and if you don't know much about food ingredients, stay away. We ordered the wild mushroom bruschetta which is suppose to come out with aged Manchego Cheese, it came out drowning in mozzarella. My wife had the shrimp salad which was supposed to be Olive oil, garlic, cumin, lemon juice, mozzarella, tomatoes, apples, and Parmesan but it also came out covered in mozzarella. Are you seeing a trend yet? I wish because my steak gyro was suppose to come with mozzerella and came with no cheese. The app we ate without saying anything because the bartender was also the waitress for all the tables and we had already took a few bites before noticing. The entrees I just gave up on because we hadn't seen bartender in a while so we just ate what was in front of us and left. The place has potential, that experience did not highlight that aspect. I hope they get a dedicated server and someone in the kitchen that can see past the mozzarella ."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would. 

Do not book an event here.

Take a moment to read this: 

We booked an office party here on 3 December 2016 for the 8th of December (2016) at 8pm EST. We were told that they would take a deposit and if anything should happen, we were required to send them a cancellation notice within 48 hours of the event. Here I am, almost 48 hours before the event, asking for a cancellation. I call Tara (who is wonderful) to let her know the situation and she states that it shouldn't be a problem. She calls the owner (who is in Egypt) and then calls me back to let me know that he meant to tell me that the policy is \"48 BUSINESS HOURS\" (~7 days). We have not signed any contract whatsoever. How could we possibly know of this policy?

Needless to say, we will make this situation known to our network. 

My suggestions if you are looking for chic banquet rooms and common courtesy: 5 Church, Reid's (their outside patio is wonderful), Sullivan's, Del Frisco's

Please note: the staff at the wine loft is incredibly helpful and kind. This is just a note about the business owner's problem solving technique. \"48 BUSINESS hours\""}
{"text":"I can not say much for food as I only had a few drinks, but like the reviewer before me says it is a great place to sit and relax.  

Surprising the food and wine is very reasonably priced.  The exterior gives no indication what so ever of the romantic environment within.  The layout, lighting, seating, and overall set up is quite impressive.  

Definitely a place to take a date."}
{"text":"Came here by happenstance and I'm glad that I did! Their lounge music, decor and ambiance was relaxing. Their wine selection was varied with reasonably prices. Our server was very attentive and friendly. I'll definitely be back : )"}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch! We came in, greeted and sat immediately. We ordered two small plates as appetizers. We had the fried green tomatoes 3 ways, which was to DIE for!! So delicious, I want to go back just for those. We also had the mussels. They were excellent. They came with a spicy sauce. It was delicious. On to the entrees, my friend ordered a burger which she said was absolutely delicious! I had the margarita flatbread with garlic and chicken added. It was flavorful and delicious. Then, we had dessert. My friend had the crème brûlée which I tried, it was good. I had the molten cake and it was absolutely perfect. Of course we need a nap after all that food but I was incredible. Service was great too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The owner, Sam, is extremely accommodating, friendly, and conversational. Every time we come in he remembers us and greets us with a hug! He is an exceptional businessman and wonderful with people & his Wine Loft has a classy, calm environment were one can savor some of the best wines in Charlotte along with whiskey (my fave!) and select quality beers like Chimay Blue (my husband's favorite!). His employees are also noteworthy! I have not met a bartender/cocktail waitress here who wasn't witty, funny, and an absolute delight! Love Lauren, & love Tara! 

Absolutely try the greek salad with chicken! Generous portion size and absolutely delicious! I own a salon around the corner and come here for salad after work and a glass of wine. 5 stars isn't enough. Locally-owned, meticulously maintained, and just right."}
{"text":"It's Ok. Just Ok.  

I've had mixed experiences here.  One time the wait staff was so unbelievably rude that I never intended to return.  By contrast, I stopped by this past weekend before the evening rush and the staff was very nice.  

I think that they have improved the quality of their wine over the years.  It's decent, but nothing that will blow you away.  

The small plates that I've had there have been pretty good. And there are a good number of weekly deals.  

One frustration is that some of the wait staff seem to know Nothing about wine.  Literally nothing.  For example, I walked in there on a cold, wet winter evening and asked what the most robust red was that they had.  The server recommended a pinot noir as the their most robust red, even though the wine list included zins, cabs, and Super Tuscans. She clearly had no knowledge of wine.  I enjoy having some eye candy serving me as much as the next guy, but train your staff so that they know the difference between tempranillo and sauvignon blanc."}
{"text":"Recently attended an event at this bar and refuse to return due to the extremely disrespectful nature of the owner. There was slight miscommunication about the intended use of space in the venue so the owner came around pointing and asking who was in charge of the event. Once he found the person he proceeded to degrade and speak harshly to the host in front of the guests. I was completely appalled and shocked that he would speak to his guests in this manner. He clearly does not value his patrons. I will not return and we be sure that no one I'm connected to returns to this facility."}
{"text":"I met a friend for a drink, which turned into two and an appetizer, at The Wine Loft on a Saturday evening.  They have several tables on an outside patio, however, very limited due to the space.  Although we started outside, the wind and rain picked up so we moved inside and took two seats at the bar. The service was nice, and they offer a great variety of wines, however, there is a definite minimum menu, and a little pricey for what is available.  We ordered the charcuterie, which was good, although I think they could have served better crostini's, I think they were from a package from HT or another local grocery store.  
As the night when on the crowd definitely got larger, which surprised me, since it is such a hidden gem.  We  also had the pleasure of meeting and talking with the owner, very friendly and is there for his customers!

Overall I enjoyed the evening and will definitely go back, especially on a nice night to enjoy a glass of wine on the patio."}
{"text":"Too bad the owner of this place has to hang out there. When meeting colleagues after work for an informal gathering, we asked for the speaker in the front seating area to be turned down. Making the wait staff uncomfortable , the owner refused.  While the whole place struggled to be heard, he sat at the bar and remained impassive. Maybe the over-priced wine and tiny little portions on the meat and cheese plate should have been indicative?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I loved having a glass of wine on the patio. Victoria (our waitress) was super nice and the prices were reasonable. I look forward to making it a go to spot and I can't wait to try their flatbreads- their food looked awesome!"}
{"text":"I was Ill prepared for the lavish world that I was stepping into. I was under dressed and was expecting something rustic (why, I dunno). Whilst the building in which the Wine Loft is housed is fairly new and modern, it gives zero indication of the chic ambiance lurking inside. I seriously had a \"woah\" moment upon entering.
 
Rich, dark, masculine undertones are complimented with black contemporary furniture. Dimly lit lights make for an intimate and romantic environment to either impress that hot date or vibe with the music with a nice glass of wine. Low key, mature and just plain sexy."}
{"text":"Awesome spot to come with friends!! Passed by here a bunch of times but decided to come by for a girls night and it was amazing!! Great music and drinks. Also, bartenders are super attentive."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and staff. The mushroom bruschetta is delicious. Cigar and wine on the patio to close it out."}
