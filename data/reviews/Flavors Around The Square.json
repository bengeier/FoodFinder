{"text":"Went on a frgid Saturday and ordered the FATS eggs benadict and it was delish.  I was afraid it was going to be too spicy but the sauce had a nice sweetness to it and just the right amount of spice.  My daughter had the Irish Skillet which she enjoyed as well. Food was hot, service good and the rest room was clean."}
{"text":"Flavors on the Square is slightly off the beaten path in a small storefront downtown. My first visit was on a Tuesday around 12:30 p.m. I was greeted by a friendly staff & immediately seated among a dozen other diners.

The dining room is small but comfortable & tastefully decorated. There are several tables in the center which may be combined for larger parties. The room was also well-kept.

I'm a brunch person so ordered cornbeef hash, 2 eggs, homefries, & toast for 7.50. My meal was quickly served & very good. They also have a separate \"specials\" menu at the table & I saw on option for AUCE soup for 4.50. My server was friendly & made check-ups.

Based upon my experience, Flavors on the Square is very good & worth visiting, especially because so many local options are fast food chains.

{"text":"excellent food and very reasonably priced !! I had the turkey club and fries, delicious...ate breakfast there another day, I did the \" build your own omelet \" and that was great too. Seriously if you're in Painesville and hungry, stop here."}
{"text":"Went to the new location this morning for breakfast.. It's much smaller than the one lost in the fire. It's very well put together. Prices were reasonable. The pancakes were a little on the dry side and the grits weren't as hot (temperature wise not spicy) as hoped. Other that a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I gave this a high rating because service was great, the cleanliness was perfect and food was very good. The pricing is very good as well. I ordered a chicken salad pita and I added the cold, clean and all you can eat salad bar for only a dollar. Soup is also included, two types to choose from. I will come back.  Their menu has great choices."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend for brunch. Very tiny establishment, but great food with great pricing. Employees are very friendly. Despite how busy they were food came out quickly. I recommend their French toast, it's cooked to perfection, most places the middle is soggy and you can taste the egg but here it's Texas French toast and it's cooked just r"}
{"text":"Very greasy food.  Keep looking. They need to use real meat instead of mystery meat. I feel for what you get the prices are out of the ballpark. Bada Bing here I come"}
{"text":"Love itttt! NY native, just moved here from boston-this is food good enough to make me feel at home! Fantastic Greek salad!"}
{"text":"Service was okay despite others being served even though we sat first. Menu and pricing where great and a nice selection to choose from. Kat got the stuffed French taste and I got their signature item FATS Egg Benedict. French toast was amazing. Benedict was horrible. Waiter had no problem letting me choose something else or taking it off the bill. Oh and they got amazing iced coffee!"}
