{"text":"Never had Filipino cuisine before, but this place made me fan. Very small place, I suggest call ahead with your order..."}
{"text":"First time eating Filipino cuisine. It was great. A lot of big flavor and interesting choices. The older woman who works here was a total sweetheart. If you in the mood to try something new this is a good place to start."}
{"text":"Kainan is a small Filipino carry out hub by State Road run by the sweetest lady you'll ever meet- Mely!:)  They serve a lot of Filipino staple food like adobo, pork barbeque, sapin-sapin, pancit, EMPANADAs and more! They can also cook your food for parties and gatherings. I consider Kainan as my kitchen away from home as Tita Mely's cooking really cure my homesickness. A lot of my friends order filipino food from them for special occasions and they never disappoint.:)   The food here is mui delicioso, so filling and very affordable. Tita Mely's warm smile and personality makes my take out experience seem like just getting my lunch or \"baon\" from my lola.:)"}
{"text":"the best filipino food i've ever tasted here in cleveland! we like to order ahead of time for big orders like palabok, pansit, beef steak, lechon paksiw and puto. I love the food and nanay mely :)"}
{"text":"Having just moved to Ohio from Los Angeles, I've been longing for legit Filipino food and I am thrilled that I've found some compatible to that of my hometown. Mely's is so authentic, right down to the location- it's exactly where I expect to find true Filipino cuisine. They make their lumpia fresh and fry it up when you order it. The bistek is AMAZING and the lechon is delicious. I'm not a diehard lechon fan, but I will happily eat Mely's anytime! Mely is so sweet and friendly, and her dishes are full of flavor. Definitely worth visiting again and again!"}
{"text":"It may be a small mom and pop place but they have the best tasting Filipino foods out there so far. Their prices are reasonable compared to other Filipino stores like Nipa Hut. I do definitely  recommend stopping by to check out their foods."}
{"text":"Second visit to Mely's was a little disappointing.  Its probably my fault, because I just ordered the beef and pork combo without seeing what it was.  But they didn't have rice.  How can you not have rice and be an asian restaurant.  The pork dish was not Adobo, which is the classic that I got last time.  And the beef was more tough.  It was a little disappointing, but I'm going to go back and try again in the future."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by today for a quick lunch. We had the Bistek, and it was great. My wife took some pork(adobo? Not sure)carry out and some kind of flan or pudding. I would ask her but she's at work. I know the place is good when my wife says it's good, instead of \"fine\", which really means \" it is borderline shite\" in Filipino. She's picky with food, especially Filipino fare. MacArthur said he would return but never did. We will  return, asap.  Oh, and at the risk of being pedantic, this place in Parma, not Cleveland."}
{"text":"So far the best filipino food Joint I have tasted here in Cleveland... Foods always fresh... ;)"}
{"text":"Tried Kainan today with their famous bistek (beef steak), also tried other stuff the dinuguan, and shanghai rolls (0.50 each).   The bistek held its reputation.   i gave it a four because the foods were very oily. probably why they were so good. i dont mind sifting the oils off. The dinuguan were ok. I like my dinuguan a little more sour depending on who's cooking and who's eating i guess. The rolls, i can taste a little oil while biting on the rolls. But other than that, the bistek supercedes everything I dont mind going back to try out their desserts and bakery.  The sweet and sour dip for the roll also looked and taste homemade, not too bad. Nice owners. Got there too early coz i only saw cassava's for dessert.  Keep in mind, always bring cash. They dont have swipes and chips. Otherwise you'd have to risk your life crossing the street just to go to the atm machine."}
{"text":"went to cleveland from califonia and I was craving for filipino food. Stayed for 4 days in ohio looking for  filipino restaurant nearby hotel..we found one ,so we drove 1 hr to get filipino food. when we get there , I saw it and at first I was like kinda suprised because it was really small. This is just a small place for to-go-food. They dont have chairs for us to seat while waiting. this is just like turo turo and go. But the lady and her mom were so nice, so thoughtful, so sweet. Their foods were delicious too, I ordered their menudo, the pork is so tender, and also dinuguan is so good though its a lil bit salty but its ok..I love how they fix everything for you..their ensaymada is good too...I highly recommend this to my friend and.people.who wants filipino food."}
{"text":"Talagang gusto ko ang pagkain dito. Ito ay masarap at nagpapaalala sa akin ng aking pagkabata.  (I really like the food here. It is delicious and it reminds me of my childhood.)"}
{"text":"Literally a whole in the wall place which means food is awesome!!!! I got the lechon kiwala which was freshly cooked and the tamarind sauce was phenomenal. I got the pork empanada which was cold but tasted so good! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cute little lady. Very small place not much room. Kind of like a hole in the wall but don't let the place fool you. Food was amazing."}
{"text":"Ok... let me preface this review by stating that this is not a place you plan an evening for... no dates, no groups, no hangin' out with your buddies. It's a very tiny take out joint. You walk in the door and you have about as much space as a broom closet to stand in. It's cramped, looks a bit disorganized, but folks... let's face it - we're here for the food.  Owned and operated by an authentic Filipino Lola (grandma), she and her place serves the quintessential Filipino comfort food. I say comfort because when I sit down, wherever I may be, to enjoy a meal from Mely's... I am taken \"home\". Memories flash of all the tastiest Filipino dishes made by the greatest Filipino cooks I've ever had the pleasure of being fed by. I've tried just about everything Aling Mely offers at this joint. Everything, and I mean everything is authentically good. But I have my two staples that I get just about every time I come here: 1) the oh-so-crispy lechon kawali - wok fried pork belly with the skin ever so crispy, chopped up in generous bite-sized pieces, served with Pinoy gravy. 2) The dinuguan. Oh, man! The dinuguan. I won't describe the details of this pork dish here, but if you're a fan of dinuguan, it's as good as any of the best I've had. It really is. And if you don't know what dinuguan is... just try it over rice. I promise you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Grab take out last night , having know idea what I was getting added to the adventure.  I was lucky a regular explained a few of the dishes for me . I can't tell you what I got sorry as it was the daily specials . However the food was amazing , melt in ur mouth . Only down fall it's cash only with no prices posted . So have no idea how much anything costed . However I enjoyed everything . I will be back !!"}
{"text":"Oh so satisfying to find \"worthy\" Filipino food in the area and even this state!!   I have to say this place tops many of the places we've been to in California, places such as Daily City and Vallejo where Filipino food is a many and places are very goooooooood!!! That is making a huuuuge statement but well deserved here.  Masarap!  We arrived on a sunny afternoon, around 1ish. It seemed like this place gets \"raided\" pretty early and our short visit here, less than 10 minutes, there must have been 5 additional customers lining up to take what was left! Bottom line, arrive early or call ahead to secure your food!   This place doesn't offer much in terms of visual simulation! If you blink, you might miss this small location nested in the middle of a small shopping location.  Matter fact it echos what you might find in the Philippines traveling down a city street and finding that home cooked meal in an alley carved out of a small store front.  Behind the simple store front is a very small location, enough to maybe fit 3-4 people, standing room only, were nothing in terms of a sit down exists here.  However, visual aside and small standing room only, it means they can focus on one thing, the FOOD!   Prices were a bit higher than we are used to in Daily City or Vallejo California. Not that it was ungodly expensive by any means. To be fair, you can throw a rock and hit 5 different Filipino joints in the Bay Area of California... Supply and Demand is working here but well worth it!   The food was amazing!  We'll be hitting this one up on the regular!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm. Filipino food.  Being randomly in Parma, we decided to get lunch and was happily surprised by Melys.  It's small-definitely take out only. Being half Chinese-Filipino (and the other half Canto), I have a deep appreciation for Filipino food and culture. So when we searched and Melys came up, I was thrilled!  A cute little Filipino lady runs the place. We entered and got the lechon (with the gravy), and the pancit. She then showed me some fresh lechon (without gravy), which I had to get a box of. Total? A ton of Filipino food for only 20 bucks (yes!).  She instantly knew I was Chinese and tried to sell me some steamed buns. She kept being like \"you know what this is! Bao!\" Hahahahahaha. I politely declined, but it's nice that she had some!  Too bad there was no Filipino desserts or drinks out, or else that would have been icing on the cake. The rest of the food that she had looked great- I may be back for that adobo. The lechon was meaty but the skin was fried to perfection- slightly fattier than what I'm used to, but still very good.  I loved the homey feel of it, and also the little Filipino lady that ran it. For that, the restaurant worked it's way into my heart, and I give it five stars.  If you want some good Filipino food, skip the buffet and just go to Melys. :)"}
{"text":"C'mon yelpers. The food is fair but this place needs some dusting and decluttering. Cash only, everything is ala carte. Guy behind counter was nice...But you can't plan to eat here, it's meant to take out so it's impractical for someone driving from a distance away from home. Depending on time of day, you may have to warm up your own food. It's only fate that determines whats still hot and fresh once you arrive. Menu is very limited, so again, don't plan to eat on site. Rating is closer 2.5 stars as it has much room for improvement. Price for my entree (beefsteak) was 8 dollars without rice. Filipino food that doesn't include rice.. kinda hurts my feelings."}
{"text":"Mely's Kainan is cash only with a single table set up if you choose to dine in. This is mostly a carry out style business. I drove out here from Independence for my lunch today. I wanted to get my usual mainstay of adobo and unfortunately they did not have it. I advise to peruse the online menu and try to order ahead. I went with the special for the day which was the bistec. It was a tender serving of beef and onion served atop a bed of white rice. A few Filipina women came in while I was there and all ordered the same. I also had the shanghai rolls and BBQ pork skewers. Everything was delicious.   What really won my heart over was the star of the show; Mely. We had a great conversation about life and our experiences as human beings. She is extremely busy because of the business and often caters to local hospitals. Her birthday is coming up in August and I am definitely stopping up to eat and celebrate. I hope that she does not retire any time soon because I want to eat some more of the wonderful food she cooks. I highly recommend Mely's Kainan for some great Filipino food."}
{"text":"I'm sorry for people who'll get offended with my comment.. but we just went there so as they say, first impression lasts.. I can bear the place and ambiance since I grew up with it. It was Sunday afternoon stopped by to grab some lunch. Though their food looks like old I didn't mind I still ordered menudo, dinuguan, and grilled chicken. All was set except for chicken, he made me choose which one so when he finally grabbed it, holy shit there were WORMS so I told about it to the man that serving it and he couldn't hear me so I had to say like 5 times I tried not to freak out.. so they checked it and told me it was because of the warm weather yesterday.. that means food was really from yesterday. I just settled with the first two orders and paid. They didn't even give us a discount and act normal like it was just a simple matter. I didn't see any surprise with their reaction which is kinda weird. But yeah we noticed that they're health permit is 5 months expired now. Well we don't always have the best experience. Just want you to be aware and pay more attention. I usually don't but learned my lesson in adiagusting way"}
