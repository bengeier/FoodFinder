{"text":"I haven't been to one of these in years.  They have closed a lot of them near me if not all of them.  We stopped here on our way to the Cleveland Zoo.  We were actually going to hit Taco Bell unitl we saw this place right next door.      The burgers and fries are as good as I remember.  The burger may have been a tad bit better actually.  I had the Buford which was two juicy patties with white cheese (American, I think) lettuce and red onion.  I love that they use red onion.  The fries are still the stellar, seasoned fries that I remember.      This place is really three and half to four stars but I pushed the extra star for nostalgia.  It reminded me of working at a movie theatre when I was 18 years old. I think we ate Rally's every other day-for the fries of course.     What a great, fast food experience. Can't wait to go back to the zoo again so we can stop here."}
{"text":"again again again this place is really starting to suck. i hate that this Rallys keeps messing up my orders"}
{"text":"I come here very often The staff members always provide me with excellent customer service especially the afternoon crew and the food tastes great the seasoned  fries are exceptionally good and the burgers are amazing"}
{"text":"Food is always Hot and fresh service is excellent at this restaurant. If I'm in Elyria I usually stop for a burger and fries here . Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I won't bother with the specifics because pretty much everything was wrong. Every single time I go to this place, the order is wrong and poorly made, that's IF their \"system isn't down.\" This is hands down the worst fast food restaurant in the region and I would be ashamed if I were responsible for it."}
{"text":"Better then McD and Bk. The Rally burger is kind of small the fries were good. Overall great alternative. Will try more options next time."}
{"text":"food was Great.... Now the service i experienced was bad. i waited for nearly 30 mins for my order and while i waited i notices that the drive thru was orders were moving fast. so if you order from rally's i would suggest going to drive thru and make sure to check your order or it my be another 30 mins before its corrected"}
{"text":"This place is the worst.  It's like they've never run a restaurant before.  I complained about the 20 minute wait for the drive through, and the manager acted as though that's normal and acceptable.  FAST food f*ckers.  Too bad as they have good burgers, totally not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Spicy chicken was really good. Fries average , Buford was better than in and out but not as good five guys. Staff extremely nice and food was ready within a minute. Overall good pricing. Would recommend to all."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Rally's, so I decided to try it out. I won't bother going back.  When I pulled up to the drive through there was a car at both the left and right hand lanes. I pulled up behind the right hand car who had yet to order. The left car soon pulled forward and then three other cars went through the left drive through while me and the car in front of me waited to place an order in the right one.  Since I had sent a text right when I pulled up, I know it was exactly 18 minutes from when I arrived to when I was able to finally get away from the place.  The lady at the window didn't know what I ordered, so I had to tell her again.  I'm not sure what I expected, but the food was mediocre at best. It reminded me of food you'd get at a bowling alley or a hospital cafeteria. I didn't finish my lunch.  I would avoid this restaurant if possible."}
{"text":"The food served here is decent. But the staff has alot to learn when it comes to appearance,hygiene and representing a business they work for. They are suspicious individuals with visible tattoos on arms and necks. They have blue,red,and green sprayed colors in hair. Nose piercings. And their attitudes are poor when it comes to customer service because they havent been educated properly and trained well to do their job in a respectful manner. The owner needs to hire quality staff workers not just a bunch of young kids that look like punks and who draw suspicious individuals and groups that hang out in outside dining area making other guests uncomfortable and feeling unsafe. The owner is like a slumlord....just collecting his money but not overseeing his business. Clearly doesnt care about the Eastlake community his business is in,if he did he would address these issues but has not. Money is all he cares about. Wouldnt recommend if you dont like feeling unsafe around suspicious shady people."}
{"text":"Since leaving Florida I missed Checkers (what Rallys is called over there), and boy was I thrilled to find it in AZ! It's been a while so I couldn't wait any longer...  Ok, so at first glance this place might not give off the best vibe. Who cares. The food is good. Tried the double rallysburger, w/ fries and a choc. milkshake. The burger is actually somewhat similar to Burger King (in a way), but better imho. The choc. milkshake was the bomb diggity fo shiggity. I mean I drank that sucker down. Others around me had nothing but good feedback so I guess it's safe to say I will pay another visit in the future.  Forget the negative reviews. Hit the drive-thru if you have doubts. The food is good!"}
{"text":"So I tried hitting the drive thru at this place the other day and after waiting for somebody to respond at the speaker for several minutes, one of the workers literally turned me away because apparently he was the only person there and he couldn't take orders and cook food all at the same time.... mind you, this was in the middle of the day too! the owner of this particular rally's should be very ashamed"}
{"text":"Banana Shake and Seasoned Fries.   Stick with that and you are good to go!"}
{"text":"Waited in line for 20 minutes, eventually pulled up to the window. The woman told us they are not running the drive thru in the side we were at. Asked them to tiurn off the light so others don't make the same mistake. She said she has no control over that. Asked if she could put up a sign so others don't make the same mistake. She said she's not allowed to do that. Asked to speak to a manager, she said she is the manager. We were instructed to get out of our car and go to the walk up window or get into the back other line for drive thru."}
{"text":"It's Rally's, either you like it or you don't. I've had delicious meals here and some that kept me away for months. But their fries just keep bringing me back!"}
{"text":"I ended up here by accident (not a happy accident).  The burger was half decent and the fries OK. The chicken tenders didn't taste like chicken, WTF? I thought almost everything tasted like chicken.  And the price, oh boy, over $21 for 2 meals of cheesburger, soda and fries, plus chicken tenders... No thanks.  Cheers"}
{"text":"The drive through guy was in a bad mood. Gave us the wrong order. Then he missed one of our sandwiches. The fries are cold and yes we are in the car. And we asked for one sandwich with onions and the other without and yep there are no onions on either."}
{"text":"Last night, my guy and I were craving seasoned fries. We are both fans of fried food, and even though we try to suppress our cravings, we cave more often than not. This time our unsuppressed craving lead us to Rallys, where We indulged in the largest order of fries. Like I said, we're down with the fried naughtiness, but these fries were WET with oil...and had an unmistakable fish flavor throughout. I had heart burn and acid reflux like crazy for the rest of the night. I like some potato with my fry please. Ouch."}
{"text":"If you want bad food, shitty service and have it served out of a dumpster, than this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"World's SLOWEST service at a drive-thru. If you want someone to offer no apologies for wasting the only thing a person can't get back then this is your spot! Add a sprinkle of Walmart across the street and you are in time-wasted heaven."}
{"text":"Made a stop before heading to the airport and do not recommend this Rally's.  No fries, bbq flavor wings, vanilla ice cream or apple pies.  Why don't they just shutdown and go home!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  I used the drive-thru and ordered two Buford burgers, one fish sandwich, and fries with all the toppings.    My dining companions liked their buford burgers.  They said these burgers reminded them of Wendy's burgers. I guess that's a good thing.    I ordered my fish sandwich because it comes with two fish filets and my head reminded me how McDonald's only gives you one.  I cut the sandwich in half and looked at the side only to find that these fish filets were super thin and there was more breading than usual.  So I was really disappointment with this sandwich and would not order it again. McDonald's gives you one filet but it is thick and delicious.    The fries were really good with all the cheese, bacon bits, sour cream(?).  They were seasoned fries to begin with so the toppings made them even better.   Tony, the server at the drive-thru was super friendly.   I Can only give you 2 stars and one if for Tony's service and friendliness."}
{"text":"The food they serve is made to order, so it takes a little longer than most \"fast food\" burger joints.  Not to worry..  It's well worth the wait.  I've eaten here a handful of times.  They are pretty consistent with their service and their food.    This weekend, I ordered via the drive-thru window, and when I got home, my fries were still crunchy.  That's always a plus for me."}
{"text":"If you go during the day, you'll get great service. Polite staff. As soon as the night time crew comes in, stay clear of this place. The people taking orders are so incredibly rude. The night time staff always seems to mess up the orders too."}
{"text":"By far the worst. The chicken I got was inedible it was so hard I couldn't even tear it in half . Fry's were also way over done this location is a joke"}
{"text":"Rally's isn't a \"fast food\" in the sense that you food is flying out on a tray 10 seconds after your credit card is swiped. It took about 3 minutes for my meal to be prepared with generally nobody else here.  So if you are in a rush... go to Taco Bell or McDonalds.   With that said... I ordered the Roadhouse Bacon Burger. It was good. The bread was even flatbread, which made it more than just standard burger.  Fries are awesome too. No ketchup required!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time to try something new... bad idea. Expensive, lack luster burgers. Their menu here on yelp does not pair up with what they actually offer either. We went through the drive through at about 830pm on a Saturday and they forgot to give us our wings. Didn't notice until we got home :-(   Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I can't even give them a star very disappointed never got treated so bad at a place,my meal looked like a 2 year old put it together so I turned around and walked up to the window to let them know how it looked they snatched my food like I was wrong for asking for fresh food so I asked for my money back the older guy working was alright but then as I was walking off the guy working the register said go eat at your on kinds place if I wasn't grown I would've acted out but Then wouldn't give me a number to the manager or nobody to contact it's sad they have workers with so much disrespect working for Rally's  then I have to give a star to post my review crazy world we in"}
{"text":"Rude people,the one\"manager\" kept ten dollars of our change and then agured about it.when I asked for the manager she said \"unlucky for you I am the manager\"I got a number to call which is just a recording and nobody calls you back."}
{"text":"I ordered a small combo number 4 without ranch. The bread wasn't toasted and dry. The meat was lukewarm at best; the bacon was chewy and fatty. I ordered strawberry Fanta and ended up asking for the orange when the CO2 containers made it taste spoiled. The fries were just about the only good thing about the meal and I wasted seven dollars."}
{"text":"First time at a Rally's, last time at a Rally's. Their fries were good but the honey mustard sause was a weird gelatin consistency. I asked for another one at too looked like brown jello. The \"chicken\" strip were paper thin oddly flavored strips. The big chicken sandwich should be called the big mayonnaise sandwich. Fries aren't worth coming back."}
{"text":"I wish I did not even have to give these people a star ! Parked in the parking lot . Was talking to my girlfriend after I ate . I was there a total of 1 hour And they called the police on me! Don't go there after work and expect to text and make any phone calls there! Unless you are the type that like to deal with police for no reason! The cops treated me like a criminal! Never step foot near this place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful low priced food. Love the fries! Love the Buffalo Hot wings, Good spicy chicken sandwich, good chili cheese fries, Good variety of burgers.  Fast service. I fight the urge to stop in almost daily!"}
{"text":"It was late and we just got off the plane from a tiring flight. Decided to try Rally's for the first time since it was pretty much the only thing on the way home that was still open. I was also kind of excited to try it out given the really good experience I had with its brother company Checkers before.   Anyway, we ordered a baconzilla combo and a 5 parm garlic wings combo. That was it. Nothing complicated!  Drove all the way home just to find out we somehow ended up with 2 sodas (yes), a small order of fries (yes), a baconzilla sandwich (yes), a spicy chicken sandwich (nope), and a big box of parm galic FRIES (NO NO NO!). More fries, yet my 5 pieces of wings are nowhere to be seen??!   The small regular order of fries was pretty tasty and crunchy. But the baconzilla, the chicken sandwich and the big order of parm garlic fries was very bland, soggy, and cold. So I only had half of the regular fries and my soda. The rest was given to my friends who just ate it because they didn't want to waste so much food.   It was almost 11pm. I ended up going to bed still hungry and disappointed because I paid almost $15 and all I got was a bit of fries and sprite :("}
{"text":"This place don't deserve no stars ! I ordered the Chicken bites combo with unsweet tea . They literally put  5 cold ass chicken bites and put fries for the rest to make it seem like they're was chicken bites in the box. The tea was left over tea and watered down with gross ice. I'm going to report you guys to the health department !!!!!!! You guys rip people off and are careless."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! Crap fries,hard hamburger buns,burger tasted like crap! I'm so disappointed! Obviously there employees take no pride in there food! I'm so pissed at this place it used to be so good!!!!!"}
{"text":"Convenient place for an affordable late night drive thru. Service is quick... food is good... prices are cheap. There is a lot to like here."}
{"text":"Stood outside waiting 20 minutes to get my order taken not recognize one minute nobody said wait hold on a second we left took 20 minutes for the lady next to me to get to ice cream cones won't be back they won't last longand only two cars in the drive-through window no one else standing around so that's four customers"}
{"text":"This place was actually disgusting on every life level. If I was starving and the only thing to eat was a rally's burger I'd probably die."}
{"text":"The burger is not tasty but the seasoned are effing delicious!!!!!!!!  The fries give you the 4 star lol..,"}
{"text":"The Roadhouse burger is a good, solid, so-not-good-for-you sandwich. Coupled with Rally's spicy fries, it's a heart attack waiting to happen. The fries on their own are worth the trip."}
{"text":"We go through here frequently, as hubby likes their cones.   This place is like all other Rally's, with 2 sides and speakers from which to order. We pulled up to the other side to order, and were rudely told to go to the other side. Fabulous. A sign, or a closed lane indicator would have been less inconvenient. But no, let's instead bark at the customers to use the other side.   I like Rally's, but this one is not a great example."}
{"text":"Used to love it here until onetime we got a meatball sub and it was everywhere. All over our food and the bag and we took it back and they were very rude. Also it is not clean. There were flies in the kitchen and on the food and one lady dropped a bun on the floor, picked it up and put it on a burger. Very good food but not at this location."}
{"text":"I love Rallys rarely go to them because often they get the order wrong but more than that pricing issues. I ordered something that was $7.49 or $7.69 I don't recall. I got to the window and it was $9.69. I said to the girl at the window,that's not the price on the board. She said we have a new sign just haven't put it up yet. I said then I should get it for the posted price. She said nothing abd closed the window. Opened it tip give me my drink and food. That's it! No answer,no I'm sorry,no change back for the price listed. Not good business practice. I was hungry so I wasn't going to make it a big deal. I'll just refuse to pay that price / leave next time."}
{"text":"go back to the days of standing in the 3rd grade lunch line. you are served up a weird textured burger on plain bun and it is so nasty you eat just enough to make it until you get to go home and not too much in order to prevent death by cafeteria food. this was very similar. even in the awkward freezer burn then microwaved scent. want to relive the elementary lunch room? take a visit here.   i really hate to give 1 star but the entire hamburger and fries had to be trashed. so nasty.  If someone suggests going to Rallys for a burger you better scream no!!!!!!!   I was hopeful, I had been a few times, never impressed but never disgusted, but i also wasn't paying attention bc i try to only eat at places like this if i'm in a hurry.  today, i was disgusted. I don't know if my senses were on height or something but this food was stinky. i have a thing about microwaves and these burgers tasted and smelled microwaved. I'm not sure if they were but i don't care, that's even worse if they werent. the meat was kinda grey and the tomatoes were colorless.   I always upgrade my drink to a large and they asked if i would like to rally my fries. i stupidly made the assumption that this meant large fries and usually places charge you less if you upgrade both, so i said yes. let me tell you what it REALLY means. it means they are going to put every nasty condiment on your fries and serve them to you with a spork.   after throwin my burger out i figured i could at least eat the fries(this was before i knew that they had been 'rally'ed up)   i KNEW i could smell mayonnaise somewhere. i HATE mayonnaise. these fries were soaking in mayonnaise, and a bunch of other slop. I didnt take a very long look at all of the nasty things on top bc i had to trash it before i threw up.   my goodness it was so gross. i can't even handle how gross it was."}
{"text":"Went to Rally's to get that quick burger fix. Service was fast and friendly as always. My only gripe was when I got home, the two of my 'double' rally's burgers both only had a single patty on them. So I basically paid for two burgers to only get one. I'll try again one more time hopefully."}
{"text":"Basic Rally's food. I only go for the fries. I got bold one day and got a fish sandwich... It was nothing to rave about. Unseasoned and bland. Fries are still hot and fresh though."}
{"text":"For a burger location these guys are great. Service is fast, double drive through lines so if you have a RHD vehicle you can roll through like a boss. Specials are great, food is tasty.... Wings are a little on the small side but about what I would expect from a fast food joint. I had a burger here and then got promoted at work..... the two might not be related but it's worth the chance."}
{"text":"Food isn't great but it's better then anything you will find at McDonald's or burger king, and it costs less for more."}
{"text":"I remember in my old high school days we would ditch school and go to Rally's to hang out and get some bomb ass fries. I was so excited when I saw the Rally's \"coming soon\" sign on Chandler Blvd just west of Alma School. Tell me why they took forever to open, though. I believe they started construction way before a certain \"Eat Mo Chiken\"  place up the street and they just barely opened a week or two ago. Anyway, I finally came by tonight to get my yummy fries fix.   Hmm... I didn't really remember the fries being like this? Maybe I'm getting it confused with another place but I thought they were regular thick cut fries with seasoning salt? Well, instead it was something similar to jack in the box curly fries, only thicker, not curly and better seasoned. It wasn't what I remembered but it was still very good. Dangerous! In fact, the burger I had also reminded me a lot of JITB. I had some sort of a bacon cheeseburger on sourdough. It was like a cross between a sourdough jack and a Carl's Jr western burger (because of the onion rings and bbq sauce). Pretty tasty.   Overall, it was a nice revisit of a chain I used to frequent. I will certainly add it to my occasional fast food rotation which thankfully isn't quite often because I'm  sure those fries are super bad for you (I know, I know the burgers are too)"}
{"text":"Working in the business area of Washington and Priest and only having 30 minutes for lunch sucks. Usually it's an epic race against time to pick something up and make it back to my desk before it's too late.   Today I decided that I was going to attempt to make it to Rally's and it was a great success. The drive-thru was completely dead, so I was able to make it back with time to spare. Personally, I think the burgers here are average but the thing that has me coming back for more is the fries. Their fries rock! Tasty and crisp, they make my fat ass happy. The only downside to this location is that the placement of the store is pretty bad and to get back on Priest can be a real pain in the ass. They also have a really bad pigeon problem outside so if you're eating there beware! Those birds are swift and dangerous and extremely hungry. Their prices are reasonable and I have never had issues with the staff."}
{"text":"I'd there anything better than a good greasy cheeseburger.  Yes, one with bacon.  I tried their steakhouse bacon double cheeseburger.   It's served on their Texas toast or is it flat bread?  The sandwich was really well seasoned and the meat was perfectly cooked.   The deal was $5 for Combo with fries and a drink.   At 12:15 pm, the line was three cars and it went quick enough I had to wait for food.   Very friendly but a little over top in trying to add dessert.   Really three times was good, four times is annoying.   All in all.  Good lunch stop."}
{"text":"Let me just state the fact that the food here isn't terrible. The problem doesn't lie within the cut up animal that is served between two buns with cheese, tomato, and lettuce. The problem is the animals that are taking and fixing our orders. They just keep fucking up my order every single time. Now I know what you are thinking you smart ass \"If they are such fuck ups then why even bother to go there? Why get on here and complain?\" The answer to that is simple: Big Buford 2 for 5 deal. This burger is delicious, but not nutritious. It's loaded with meat and cheese and has flavor. It's so damn good. It's so damn good to the point that you are willing to deal with lazy, stupid employees who hate you and their life. One bite out of this thing and you are in burger bliss, baby. The animal that had it's life taken from it serves a better purpose now than when it was alive. Just make sure for the love of god you check your order when you get it. That needs to be done every single time. They still owe me two medium sized fries. Pricks."}
{"text":"My food was repulsive.  I ordered a rally burger without the bun and what I got was a cold hamburger patty with a cold slice of American cheese along with the toppings. No attempt was made to warm up the meat or melt the cheese... It was truly disgusting. My kids Love to come here for the fries but that's all we will order from now on. I would never order a hamburger from them again. Gross!"}
{"text":"food sucked, bread was very stale on my bufford, fries were cold and hard! went back to give a second chance using one of their guest coupons i got from leaving feedback, same results! Then to top it off i could hear the white trash cashier telling the manager \"he's got one of those guest crap coupon things\"."}
{"text":"In the final moments of your life you'll clutch in vain to your chest as it convulses while your heart dutifully tries and fails to force blood through the clogged and hardened garbage disposal which was once your aorta..   your life will replay at lightning speed through your darkening mind - revealing at once the moment this fate was sealed.    That moment will be Rally's french fries.    Your final gesture will be a Mona Lisa smile of satisfaction and peace,   because it was WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"It is so annoying that a FAST FOOD restaurant charges for water I mean seriously when you sit here the atmosphere is bland and boring the employes are not enthusiastic or inviting the restaurant industry should serve hospitality not regret it's quite irritating they need a lot improvement. A good staff is the back bone of a restaurant so a better attitude should result"}
{"text":"I only come to Rally's just to order their fries and sometimes their strawberry cheesecake stuffed cone ice cream. For some reason I am always craving those two items. Everything else is unappealing to me. If you come late at night, service can be a little bit slow because there is only one guy working there."}
{"text":"Rally burger is a pretty great alternative to McD's or BK, and its somewhat unfortunate that there aren't more locations in the Phoenix area. Their seasoned fries are awesome and even better with chili. What I was really impressed with, though, is their value burger selection and flavor. A simple rally burger is a buck and change and seems like some of the non-value burgers at other fast food. Good condiment to meat ratio, and flavorful. And no skimping here...you get all the condiments even on a value burger: lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion...all that. The other thing I really liked was they have a value buffalo chicken burger which was actually really tasty. All in all, yes its fast food, but its a different flare with unique options and arguably better quality in some areas."}
{"text":"Rally's is slow either you like it or you don't. I've had good meals here and Not so good new items so I go mainly for a burger and ice cream. .."}
{"text":"I tried Rally's for the very first time on Thursday. It was lunchtime and I got in and out of their drive-up in 5 minutes tops! Their service was so quick and good, but the food was a bit pricey for my liking ($7.45 for what I had).   I will say this though: I did enjoy the combo I had that day. It was their Double Double Fish Combo with a large size Diet Coke and Seasoned fries.   I'm sure I'll try them again because they have other items which look very good as well."}
{"text":"Wow!  I haven't eaten at a Rally's in like 15 years.  Almost every one in Pittsburgh was in a pretty ghetto area.  I had to check out the new one in Chandler because it will be nice to eat at a Rally's without constantly  thinking, \"Don't make eye contact.\"  The hamburger was below average.  It fits right in with Jack in the Box, Burger King, Carl's Jr, etc.  (Maybe Sonic is the best comparison.)  It's a notch below my favorites of In & Out, Wendy's, and Whataburger.  Note:  McDonald's is in its own class because it doesn't even seem like meat... you could give me a full kitchen and a chemistry set, and I could never make anything that tastes remotely like McDonald's.  The fries were outstanding, probably the best of all fast food fries.  They're extra crispy with a spicy seasoning.  (In my youth, I remember them having an orange cheetoh tint to them, but they looked normal today.  You could even see potato skin on the ends of them.  Nothing else stood out.  They have hot dogs and wings, both of which are a little unusual for fast food places.  Like competitors, they've added giant hamburgers to keep pace with fat America.  Miscellaneous tip:  The parking lot is so incompetently designed that FEMA must somehow be responsible.  You might want to park behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love their cheese champ burger! My only complaint is that their hours of operation are never the same. Online it says they open at 9:30 but they are never open at this time. I even came another time at 10am and was told they wouldn't be open for another 10 minutes. So what time do you open 9:30 or 10:10? Please figure out your hours of operation and update your time online, this is a business."}
{"text":"If you want your food cold and wait a good 15 minutes, this is your kind of place. The service was below average and so was the food. I could recommend staying completely away from this establishment"}
{"text":"WOW this place is the BEST. The fastest drive thru friendly. Realy better then (in and out burgers) ."}
{"text":"If you love sitting in your car waiting for slow drive thru service, this rally's is for you. Slowest rally's I have ever been to.  Even mid day.  Food is ok.  I love the taste or rally's.  if the service wasn't so damn slow it would be a regular stop."}
{"text":"Rally's was the best place here in the valley at one time!  Sorry they closed so many stores.  When I saw this one still open, we tried it and to our dismay, just wasn't the same.  The people behind the counter were NOT friendly whatsoever. The Burger was semi-cold along with the fries and when I brought it to their attention, they thought I wanted my money back, not the case, just thought as an owner, I'd want to know!  Oh well, moving onto the next find!"}
{"text":"Oh Rally's how I've missed you! While I do what I can to avoid fast food, Rally's has a special place in my heart - cholesterol. Not sure how this location has been overlooked, but it is one of the better Rally's I have been to.  Place is clean, employees are friendly, orders are accurate, and best of all, food is hot and made correctly!  Bacon Roadhouse burger was excellent! Cinnamon apple pies were quite good too.  But this being fast food, I really can't in good consciousness give it 5 stars. Does that make me a food snob? Do I care? :p"}
{"text":"Rally's...what can I say? I'm so so so so sorry for ever going to the Burger King down the street! I didn't know you were there! Tucked all in the corner there, with the black and white sign, no big neons or nothing!   Baby you know I love your Big Bufford! It is really big, but baby you know I like it that way! NO... I LOVE it that way. C'mon!  You know when I dig deep into your fries that I love you! I don't know why you doubt me... the McDouble was just a phase! I was young and stupid...   I was wrong. I love you. I'm sorry..."}
{"text":"Not bad...not bad at all.   The looks of the place will make you never want to come here. The pigeons having lunch on the tables would make you want to stay away. However, it was not bad A-OK as Yelp would say.   O....fries were bomb."}
{"text":"I generally like Rally's simpler burgers -- they get carried away for my taste with some of their elaborate combinations.  Service is good at this location.  Food prepared well and quickly.  Nice, convenient location for those fast food cravings."}
{"text":"The only food that is good is the chicken box, good prices. The only thing is sometimes it takes a while to get food. I waited 10 minutes one time for anyone to come help me due to what looked like a pretty obvious drug deal in the back. But overall is decent, good apple pies"}
{"text":"absolutely horrible..messed up my order and food was soggy and disgusting..never again."}
{"text":"Initially, when I started this review I had it @ one stars and then realized that the frys were A-OK so I changed and bumped it up to three with regard to the frys.  Everything else.  Bleck.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger.  I'm not sure what was going on with the shape of the hamburger.  It looked like a flower.  But more over tasted like nothing.  No flavor, no heat.  My burger was cold when I chomped down on it.  That's just gross.  When I kept looking @ the burger itself I couldn't help but think they were the frozen patties that you get @ like Costco or the local supermarket.  At least with those you can gussy them up a bit.    The medium drink cup was good.  It wasn't a thimble or a 182 oz size.  Perfect.  The medium fry box was a joke.  The fries are good.  Nice seasoning, cooked well.    This was my first experience with Rally's.  I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food is ok, no restrooms to wash up.... bad lunch spot when you only have 30 minutes."}
{"text":"(Real name: Rally's)  A pretty good fast food burger place. Just as good as Burger King or McDonald's. It's a drive thru place though and there is no real sit down space except for some picnic tables outside. Decent fast food and fairly quick service so I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I've been here a few times and everything I've tried had been delicious. I just have two gripes, otherwise I would have given this place 5 stars. The building is run down. It looks like their property manager or owner is slack with getting routine maintenance done on the place. Also, the service has been kind of mediocre. One time, I walked up to the window and was put on hold in mid-sentence so the cashier could finish up at the drive-thru. Another time, they screwed up my order. Oh well. At least the food is awesome."}
{"text":"They typically argue with what their website says the have. They don't understand that \"plain\" or \"only meat and cheese\"  means no ketchup, onions or mustard. They give the wrong condiments and take forever to begin making the order. Through the window you can see them wrapping up a conversation about their personal lives BEFORE  cooking the meat or fries or whatever you ordered.    The only redeeming quality is the flavor of the food itself. So if you're good with the default set up of a burger and waiting twice as long for it to be made if they decide that the menu item you're ordering exists then go for it. And if the website is wrong then maybe it should be dealt with."}
{"text":"Got there when it was super busy. They got our order and set us on our way pretty fast. Got 4 roadhouse burgers, 2 bacon double rallyburger with cheese, 3 large fries and 2 large pops for about $30 which is pretty not bad since we got extra stuff on them too."}
{"text":"Fries are good. Burgers are okay. Shakes taste good and are thick but are kinda warm which was a weird experience. All in all no real complaints but it's just another fast food place. Nothing really special."}
{"text":"I recently visited this location of Rally's Hamburgers. The crew had left the front unattended. A few others and I were waiting for a long time and nobody came to assist us. The others that were others waiting for the crew members to assist them and they stated that they had been waiting about 15 minutes and knocking on the windows to attract the attention of the crew members. At first it seemed as though they all abruptly left during their shift but then I later saw them appear as I left. It seems as though their ice cream machine never works."}
{"text":"Went in for late lunch after visiting Sweeties Candy. The burger was really good and their fries were perfectly seasoned. Only complaint is that their pricing is strange - they have a 2 for $3 menu but the woman didn't tell me that if you only want one, it's $3 on it's own. I could have basically received a burger for free if only I'd asked for it. Unhelpful staff is annoying, but I have no complaints for the food."}
{"text":"A bit sketchy at night, but we always go through the drive thru and their always pretty quick.  Their burgers are great, and their seasoned fries....*drool*. My hubby loves their bacon cheese fries."}
{"text":"Gross. The spicy chicken sandwich was small and basically all lettuce. The \"chicken\" was questionable - basically tasted like a sponge. Never again."}
{"text":"dude. I just like it. It's hot, fast and cheap. (Kind of like someone i know... that's what she said... but I digress.) The only thing is that sometimes at night there is no manager on duty so the employees are totally fucking off and slow and will charge you the wrong total... but it's so inexpensive anyway you likely won't really notice or care. But I'm a cheapass so i noticed."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Everyone here had an attitude. They took 25 minutes for one order and got mad at me when I asked for a status when people behind me had their food before me. Do not recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm glad we all agree this place is the grossest all time worst.  I tried the fish sandwich, without question it was the greasiest gross disgusting fish in the fast food industry.  The double burger had a  wet bun with a disgusting mess of stale veggies.  It doesn't get worse, honest.  Almost forgot the trifecta hat trick, the fries were ultra greasy, sloppy and tasteless"}
{"text":"You know you've hit the dregs of post-2 A.M. grub when you see that anything quick and fit for human consumption is closed and you turn your wearied eye towards Rally's.   If it's not the homeless man who tried to wedge himself between your car and the window and offers to give your money to the cashier for a fee that gets you, it's the disgruntled teenagers hanging out that shower your car with what's left of their milkshakes.   I can say this for certainty: This place sells food ostensibly for humans. Whether you should purchase and willingly put it in your body is a question only you can answer."}
{"text":"If you want to feel really bad about what you're eating, you'll love Rally's...  I tried this place for lunch, after I heard about the \"Baconzilla\". I love bacon, so this burger sounded like a match made in heaven for me. The burger itself was OK, though I didn't love it. It was two patties, cheese, and about 47 slices of bacon. The bacon was the saving grace, as the burger itself was a little dry and didn't have a ton of flavor. You can also have different styles of \"loaded\" fries, I had seasoned fries with cheese and bacon. When I think about my meal there, it's amazing that I've lived long enough to write this review...  It's a quaint little place, you can either walk up and eat outside or do the drive thru, either way the food is ready pretty quick. In addition to burgers they have chicken strips and a double decker fish sandwich, so it's not all about the red meat. It's not high quality, and it's the furthest thing from good for you, but if you're in the area and you want a greasy burger, Rally's is a good place to try."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just went for a very late dinner. When we ordered, the worker on shift seemed slightly rude but it's almost 1am so I understand. After ordering, we received massive cups for our drinks (they're huge I suggest sharing) which was not a bad thing at all. We received our food and started snacking on fries while we drove home, about 1-2 miles down the road. The fries were almost doughy, with very little flavor, they were just very flimsy and chewy. After we arrived in our apartment, we opened our burgers (we each had 1 rallyburger with cheese) to find completely unmelted/room temperature cheese and a cold hamburger patty. Everything seemed like it had been sitting out for quite some time. The burger tasted identical to a McDonald's burger. Rally's was $14 for two #4 combos, I could get the same stuff a McDonald's for less than $10 with a large drink upgrade. Personally, I would save the money and go to McDonald's. Also, rally's to me was not worth all the calories."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was never a fan of this place, but there is a Rallys right next to my work, so I decided to go one day on my lunch.  I was pleasantly surprised. I have gone back multiple times since.    Food is always hot when I get it.  Quality for the price is pretty good in my opinion.  They give you coupons with every order, 20 coupons to be exact, and I feel like I am stealing.    $2.49 for a spicy chicken small combo (with coupon).  This one is my favorite, and how can you beat $2.49!?  Drive through is fast, I think I only had to wait one time, and that was because the car ahead of me was clearly having a difficult time with what they were ordering.  I am not a fan of the fries, I will eat them, but they are not my favorite.  They are seasoned.   As for the drive through, always use the right side. For people that complained in other reviews, lets put our thinking cap on!  The right drive through is the drivers side, meaning you can order, pay, and receive your food on the drivers side.....if you go to the left drive through, you have to do all that, on the passenger side, and what a stretch that is. Obviously if you have a passenger it is not an issue, but the right side is the main side, and will always be the one open  Pretty easy to tell when it is opened or closed, if there are no cars on the left side, then it is closed.  pretty simple.   4 stars, because the price is unbeatable with the coupons they hand out, and the quality is pretty good for what you pay."}
{"text":"rallys dude drove here drunk last sunday. me and burd ordered some blt's and i said \"gimmie ur largest order of onion rings my man!\" we were sitting there chowin down when all of a sudden a brawl broke out. luckily  they were throwin broomsticls chairs and razor wire (only at each other dude)i had my mace can but fired it backwards out accident as i tried firing indiscriminately. shot it in my bug glasses sorry dude."}
{"text":"Just not feeling Rally's. someone got takeout for me in 2012 and I even refused the soda. Just. not feeling. it."}
{"text":"Not sure why this Rally's gets such a bad wrap. I've never had a problem with my order. Always accurate. Always hot. Fresh fries."}
{"text":"Rally's has the best french fries in the universe.  I don't know if they were the first to do it, but Rally's french fries were the first seasoned fries that I ever had, and that was in the late 80s or early 90s.  The Big Buford is one of the best hamburgers around, and their prices are quite reasonable.    My first experience with Rally's was in my home town in Escondido, CA.  I hadn't eaten at a Rally's in over 6 years when I ran across this location by accident a few weeks ago.  When they first opened in Escondido I remember that the seasoned fries were the signature item.  I don't think they play them up as much anymore, but they're still just as good as I remember.  The location of this restaurant is not ideal for most people as it's a little too far for most ASU students to get to quickly and there isn't aren't a lot of businesses nearby either.  If you find yourself in the are, then eat here.  You'll love it!"}
{"text":"The food here is like a worse version of Arby's. Waste of money!"}
{"text":"I think all of their sandwiches are pretty terrible. They're bland, small, and have an odd texture. I tend to feel awful if I eat their sandwiches. Their fries however are probably my favorite fries from any fast food joint. My boyfriend and I have actually grabbed some of their fries to go but pick up sandwiches elsewhere. Lol so they get 3 stars for the yummy fries!!"}
{"text":"Horrible Service! I had placed 6 orders individually to avoid any mess up. Well as the line grew behind me I start hurrying up but still reading my orders carefully. THEY STILL MESSED UP! We got no fries for 2 of our orders and one order was something we didn't order! OK, we only have 30 mins for lunch, I called them 7 times and NO answer, I get a fax #. I have a co-worker that offered to take my receipt in and pick the missing items. I agreed, she called me while she was there picking up the items and put me on the phone with a lady that wasn't the manager, because she was yelling out to the manager my issue, they tell me because the order that was not right I have to bring back the burger to get replaced, that's fine but I'm not getting off work to fix a burger. Then she told me because my coworker doesn't have both receipts she can only replace ONE order of fries and a small at that but I got a meal for a large, got the soda but not the LARGE fries! I will never go back here. I wouldn't even rate them one star."}
{"text":"Has anyone seen the Undercover Bosses- Rally episode It's a good one I enjoy chowing at Rally's from time to time. It always seems like such a different experience compared to today's big corporations like Mcdonald's and BK This is the only Rally's location I know of in Phoenix but I am pretty sure there are a couple more  The food is good here The Burgers are nice and a good size The fries have a nice texture The milkshakes and sundaes are wonderful  The customer service is superb as well  If you haven't been to Rally's  You're missing out"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today after a a co-worker talked me into joining him. I have not been to a Rally's for about 15 years - I used to come here when I was younger because it was always inexpensive.   I had a double cheeseburger combo meal. I'm not really a fan. The service was actually fast compared to some of the other reviews, but I'm just not a fan of the food. The fries were really greasy and I didn't like the taste of the burger.   Yeah, yeah... I know. \"It's fast food - what did you expect?\" But with so many other burger options out there, I will not be coming back. You can get a much better quality fast food meal at Five Guys or In And Out."}
{"text":"Went last night to try the Cheddar biscuit shrimp and fries for $2.00.  Was greeted with a friendly greeting, promptly took my order and was again greeted at the window.  Meal was about what expected.  They do have great burgers though.  I will be back for the 2/$5 Big Bufords, they are the real deal. I like them better than 5 Guys."}
{"text":"You can bring your bike when ordering. Service is fast and courteous. Fries are the best!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Got murder wrongntwice in A row. Manager did nothing other than say sorry. Waste of time and money never will have my business again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their cheeseburgers and fries. 4 stars bc a little pricey for the sizes"}
{"text":"I wouldn't give this place any stars if it was an option. Absolutely terrible service. Did not pass health rating. Literally has a public notice in the window of the drive thru. Food was of extremely poor quality."}
{"text":"So I ate at Rally's for the first time in several years yesterday. All in all, it was better than what I remembered. I was surprised, and as fast food goes, I would have given it a five but I got the milkshake and it was not good. I would eat there again but stay away from the shake."}
{"text":"Was super surprised that I found a Rally's here in Arizona.  Growing up in San Antonio, Rally's was always a place I ate at with my family, but sadly they closed in Texas so I figured that they went out of business.  When I got my burger and fries it was just as I remembered, fantastic!  If you want a different take on a fast food burger this place is it!"}
{"text":"I went through the drive through and ordered four Rally burgers with no cheese and a kids chicken and fries kit. The order taker said, \"Do you want cheese on those Rally burgers?\"  I loudly and clearly said, \"No!\"  When I got home, all four Rally burgers had cheese and no one in my house, except me, eats cheeseburgers. That's not good because the cheese was melted onto the burger so much that it could not be removed. So my wife took my daughter to Burger King while I combined the four Rally burgers into two double Rally burgers. The Rally burgers were pretty tasty to me!  I looked at the receipt and I was charged $1.49 each for cheese burgers instead of $1.00 each. That kind of pissed me off, but oh well. Since when does \"No\" sound like \"Yes\"?  Don't answer that.  Two stars for service.  Three stars for food."}
{"text":"Only one side of the drive through was open, but they didn't have it marked in any way, so I wasted a few minutes there. Once I was on the right side, it took fifteen minutes before I had my food. The sauces I asked for weren't there and they gave me the burger (which he had confirmed was a burger) in the chicken sandwich form, which I don't like. The employees were clearly understaffed and working hard, but rushing."}
{"text":"Love this Rally's! Excellent food and service. Their fries are THE best! Very fast and good customer service. They usually run pretty good specials too!  Nice outside dining area that is kept clean and well taken care of. Glad this Rally's opened up in Eastlake!"}
{"text":"Just went to the 150th location with the pooch, because I had a coupon. This is about the only reason I hit fast food ever. Feeling like I pulled a fast one on the restaurant. The fact I had to order  something called a \"Big Buford\" shook me to my core. But she loves the drive through so much. She dances in the back seat and squeals. That's probably a bad thing. Cesar Milan would most certainly frown on that shit.   However, this 117th location has much more historical value. We used to drive out from Lake County to go to the Chamber(Stefanie chortles in her labcoat) every couple of months. Once you get out of there, you're drunk, hungry, oddly horny, and everything is closed. Except My Friends. And we're not doing that since we don't want to see all the same people who were just in the Chamber. So we would hit Rally's. Banana shake and fries. Every time. Devoured before we even got to Route 2. Though we never finished the shake. It sat in the fridge overnight and became a morning hangover slime to down with aspirin. Truly, food for the undead.  Now that I get it once a year as an actual meal, I can't say it's better or worse than any other fast food. But the experience always takes me back to those days. The employees are always laid back folks who have pretty much hit bottom in life and are just there as part of their probation. The fish sandwich(the Deep Sea Double I believe) is a way better bargain than the McDonald's Filet O Minnow. The fries are still top notch. We even took our out of town yelp visitor from Minnesota there on the way to the airport when she had to leave. This was after a night of drinking on the front steps(after a visit to the Phantasy- oh, how life repeats itself). Don't know if she reviewed it/liked it/ kept it down. Never asked her. But, it's always there waiting for post debauchery appetites like that line from the song \"It's a Thin Line(between love and hate)\". Lyrics:  IT'S FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND YOU'RE JUST GETTING IN YOU KNOCK ON THE FRONT DOOR AND A VOICE SWEET AND LOW SAYS \"WHO IS IT?\" SHE OPENS UP THE DOOR AND LETS YOU IN NEVER ONCE ASKS WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN SHE SAYS \"ARE YOU HUNGRY? DID YOU EAT YET?   No, Rally's I haven't. Let's do this."}
{"text":"After going to a Rally's regularly when I lived in Indiana, I was excited to see one of these in Tempe. However, my excitement was tempered over several visits.  First of all, if you're not familiar with Rally's, it is drive-up and walk-up only, with no inside dining. If you are not sitting at one of the few patio tables with umbrellas, you're gonna get it to go.  The fries can be some of the best around. However, they can also be less than desirable, who knows what changes their quality from visit to visit. The burgers can range from really good to almost crappy. Once again, I haven't figured out why they change so much. Service is consistent, though. Consistently slow.  I'm not saying stay away...but if you go, expect slower service than many fast food places, and inconsistent food quality."}
{"text":"This location has no dipping sauces today the shake machine is awesome down and customer service actually sucks today."}
{"text":"Didn't know if the place was even open. Service was fast, food was delicious (like, really delicious), and we didn't get food poisoning.   If you're looking for comfort, you won't find it here. The place is sketchy. The food looks gross. But if you're just looking for a scrumptious burg, some dope fries and don't care about the presentation, I'd recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"First time ever eating here and probably wouldn't go back if given the choice. Not this particular location, but any in general. The food wasn't terrible but the portions were very small for the price."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh there is a freaking Rally's in Tempe!  I drove past it and I swear my heart fluttered.    The burgers are just as good as I remembered them.  The onion rings are oh so yummy!  The shake wasn't quite as good as I'd remembered from the one that used to be by my house during the \"Rally's explosion\" in the 90's, but it was still good.    While I was there last time there was - and I SWEAR to you I'm not joking - a small bus pulled up in front, a group of people got out and went to stand at the window.  As I was getting my food and driving away folks were slowly getting back into the bus with their food.  Where to I sign up for the Rally's tram???"}
{"text":"It's been a little over 25 years since I have been to a Rally's. Last time was when I was stationed in Florida and I was pregnant with my daughter, Rally's was my favorite place to go. A Rally burger with extra pickles and Vanilla shake is what I always craved. So when I saw one here in Tempe I was excited and decided to come and get a classic. The service was fine, however shake machine was down, no worries, but the Rally burger was awful. It was cold and could not find the meat. Of course I went through drive through, my office is three blocks away. The burger was worse than a McDonalds burger. I was very saddened at my experience today with Rally's as it was one of my most favorite places back in the day. The fries were good as I remember and I settled for a smoothie because again the shake machine was down. The Mango Smoothie was pretty tasty. I give 2 stars because the Rally burger was absolutely awful. Maybe I will visit again at a different time and try again for a burger but, if I am met with another cold, unmelted cheese because so cold burger and hardly any meat, I will have to bid farewell to a place that used to be rated better than the average McDonalds. I hope Rally's looks at their review and improves their burgers to the quality I know they can be."}
{"text":"I'm giving Rally's 4 stars because I love their fries! Their fries are so good! They come with other options like loaded fries and chilli fries but I've never gotten those kinds. We have had the Rally burger, the Big Buford, the spicy chicken, fries, ice cream - thats about it. I will say, it doesn't seem as cheap maybe, like the spicy chicken combo is a regular price combo, but it is made of a chopped up chicken patty, when I would expect a real chicken breast for the price.   This place is a drive thru - not sure if that is trypical, tho I think it is. They seem to be pretty good with getting the order correct, and moving the line along."}
{"text":"Rally's... I seem to cross paths with you every couple of months.    Now your fries are without a doubt, hands down the best I have ever had.  Ever.  I just wish your small order contained more than 18 fries (yes, 18 was all that was in a small order.  $1.29 for that)  In my opinion, worth it.  Just barely.  On my latest visit, my order was taken by a girl waving me to the window, a nice, fresh, proudly displayed hickey on her neck, and I think she was older than I am in.  Took a bit to contain my laughter and place my order.  The burgers, nothing to write home about.  Not all that bad, but not all that extraordinary.  But for the prices on your budget menu, I'm not in a condition to complain.  The grease soaks through the buns nicely.  The cheese never seems to melt all the way and remains suspect.  So, there is no inside dining room here.  The seating is outside on a covered patio, like at a Sonic.  Most of the tables have graffiti carved in them in some sort of language I can't read.  Almost like cave dwelling pictures. When the weather is nice in Arizona, I do like sitting out on the patio, taking my time eating, savoring those awesome, awesome fries, and wondering what sort of chemicals are in the cheese.  This particular location, however, has a pretty serious problem with pigeons.  On my last particular visit, I was trying to eat, and those winged, rat bastards were getting close, standing on my shoe, looking for food with absolutely no fear of people.  They looked a bit heavy and knew they had a good thing going there.  I try to kick them off and \"\"shoo\" them away.  I failed impressively.  They didn't care.  When I was leaving, another customer sat down, put his food out, and walked back to the window (I assume for ketchup or napkins or something because he was only gone for about 30 seconds)  In that time, the birds jumped up on the table, and attacked his food with the precision of a smart bomb.  Jumped up on the table, ate ALL of his fries, almost the entire top bun of his burger, and knocked his drink over.  He comes running back, yelling \"Go away, get!\"  (The pigeons do not speak English, and continue to devour his food)  He looks at the tattered remains of his meal, throws what is left in the bag, and throws it away in the trash can, yells \"FUCK!\" as loud as possible and storms off to his car.    One of the remaining pigeons shits on the table.    Laughed my ass off.  Not a bad place to stop at, just don't leave your food attended."}
