{"text":"I freakin loved this place! My friends and I dropped mushrooms, danced to this kick psychedelic rock band that I wish I remembered the name of and had a great time going back in time. Do yourself a favor and do the same then take a stroll around town. One street,you can't get lost,  its beautiful, its safe, its quiet. What more do you want people!"}
{"text":"Small town dive bar heaven! Walk in to a shot gun room that goes waaaay back, a long dark wooded bar that goes about 3/4 of the waaaaay back, old copper ceiling tiles, dark brick walls, a flat top grill & deep fryer behind the bar, a jukebox and a gosh darned popcorn machine. This place is perfect. Not to mention the cheap beer & drinks. And, they serve one of the best bar burgers in the universe. We ALWAYS hit Shipley's when we're in Madison. Alas, they still allow smoking, but the place itself is clean including the restrooms."}
{"text":"This place has amazing burgers! Omg so good!  Wish there was a little more room. It does get crowded and getting up to the bar to order or pay can be difficult if the place is crowded"}
{"text":"Honest to God... I spent my-last-minute-why-not bachelor party here.  It's a good dive.  One bar down the side with some bar games in the back... standard and worth it.  I remember there being food but I was mostly wasted off my future father-in-law's open tab but we were fed...  It was a good night, with no need to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"We were visiting Madison for the day and were told that Shipley's was the place to get the best burger in town.  Shipley's is a bar and they categorize themselves as such, complete with juke boxes, sports paraphenalia, a huge bar and some seating, not necessarily on the comfortable side.  BUT, we had great service from a friendly and knowledgable server who gave me a large free sample of Shocktop beer.  I'm not a beer drinker but Shocktop was very refreshing, citrusy and really good!  The cheeseburgers were tasty and cooked just right for all three of us.  We all enjoyed the hot and fresh and crisp fries and done-just-right onion rings."}
{"text":"Wife and I drive from Louisville just for the burgers... They can't be beat! The staff is always attentive and friendly-thank you Kendra for your mad ninja griddle skills!  Best of all this is a no frills no B.S. bar. Its not shiny or trendy its perfect. Don't change a thing."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!!!! By far one of if not the best burger ive ever had!!!!! Onion rings were fantastic as well.  Service was amazing the ladies were very nice.  I would highly recommend this place.  Don't be intimidated from the outside of the building it is a friendly atmosphere and very clean and nice.  You will love it I promise.  Take it from a fat guy it was awesome."}
{"text":"This place is perfection. Great bar, good food, and $4 pitchers of beer. And BONUS! They are now nonsmoking. No smoke! Brilliant. Go here now!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer specials daily best food and Kendra is the best and makes a great burger!!!!!"}
{"text":"The beer's good. The whiskey's aged. ( if you get here late in the day). Smoke free since October. Git here now."}
{"text":"Stopped in at 4 pm on a Saturday and the place was about half full.  Bartenders were very nice, friendly, and quick to fill an empty glass!   

We had a burger and fried green beans.  Very tasty bar food.  

Cool atmosphere from a bye-gone era.  Clean and comfortable with reasonable prices.  Highly recommend.  Over 21 and older."}
{"text":"Our local triple D!!! As in Dive bar.   The cheeseburgers are the best in town.  Flat top griddled and made to order we order lunch once a month.  Cold cheap beer and a burger what can I say ... You'll crave it once you go and know."}
{"text":"The place is a bar with good food, what's not to like.  The bar was absolutely packed with one bartender/cook/all in one.  I still received pretty good service for the amount of business they had.  It's not four star dining and I wasn't expecting that.  Tried the Fried Bologna sandwich based in bartender's recommendation and I Was not disappointed. 
I would go back but would not make a special trip to get there"}
{"text":"Shipley's Tavern was one of my most common bar haunts during my time in college. Now that I've just returned back to the area, I just entered Shipley's for the first time in years. It hasn't change much--with the exception of removing the bowling maching (NOOOO!) and adding some new games in the back. They still have $1.00 jello shots, $4.00 pitchers, and $2.50 well drinks all the time. One thing I had never had when in college was their food (besides the free popcorn). I had my first even Shipley's burger today for lunch. Their normal size is a half pound, and their small size is a quarter pound. Massive burgers! They come with fries. The bartender/grillmaster was so nice, helpful, and her customer service was fantastic. Definitely a great place for a juicy burger. My only complaint is that the bar still allows smoking. If you don't want to smell like an ashtray, I suggest taking your order to go."}
{"text":"Best Fish Sandwich!  Our hiking group, 16 of us stormed into this wonderful place after a six miles hike at Clifty fall state park."}
{"text":"The Shipley cheeseburger will have you thinking about it for weeks.  We live about four hours from here and try to stop in for some beers and a burger every time were near.  We love Madison and try to go a few times a year.  The people hear are always nice and its a clean bar with a lot of history.  No smoking since October."}
{"text":"My first time exploring Indiana, we drove through this little down and decided to get a bite to eat. It's your typical dive bar. The service was mediocre. I ordered a strawberry beer which was interesting! The beer was really cheap which was a plus. I tried the Shipley cheese burger, it came with pickles, onion, and tomato. It was a good burger and I ate the whole thing. It also had a side of French fries, they were really nice and crunchy. Overall it was a pleasant experience, but personally didn't think it was anything to rant and rave about. If I lived in that town I would eat there occasionally but I wouldn't drive hours to order their burger."}
{"text":"Yes it's a dive!!! But hey what's the fun in a chain??  1.50 longnecks on Sunday!  Decided to take a mini road trip and found ourselves here!!!  Bartender very nice and the locals polite too!"}
{"text":"The burger is huge! And delicious. The fried green beans were phenomenal, French and crunchy.
There is a coupons in a booklet available at the hotel for buy one get one free burger, so lunch was a bargain."}
{"text":"Had a Christmas party at shipleys last night. 
They did not disappoint. If your in Madison don't miss shipleys. It worth the visit just to have a cheeseburger. One of the best dive bars in southern Indiana."}
{"text":"Best cheeseburgers in Madison, IN! It's a dark little bar, so be prepared. No smoking anymore which is great!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and great drinks. In love all the ladies who work there to make it an awesome place to hang out. Love meeting up with family and friends for burgers and beers!"}
{"text":"Know for Big Burgers.... should of got them... wings not good enough to rate.  But the burgers looked good.  Got wings because it was the special of day.... service 5 star.... lady on grill rocked it.
Will go back , but grabbing a burger.  4.9 stars as a visitor... Chef rating just under 4 stars... mainly for reason be good at all your menu especially if it is your special"}
{"text":"I can't believe these are the best burgers in Madison. Dry, no taste and 45 minutes to get one. At least the bottle beer was cold. Won't go back."}
{"text":"a fun place...with surprisingly good food...

....and you don't even have to bother bringing your smokes...since there is more than enough second hand smoke to satiate even the most die hard leather lungs !

The smoke is unfortunate...but....that's whatchya get in small town Hoosieranna....

Terrific staff...and a crowd hell bent on having a great time !"}
{"text":"The burgers are great the sauces they had were a hit with my crowd! Nice local hang out close to the music venue in the
park on the river. I'll be back when I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Amazing hand made hamburgers at a little off the beaten path bar plus pitchers of beer and very pleasant service"}
{"text":"Burger was great. The bartender was great. There was a fight outside between a drunk guy and his girlfriend then he came in and was obnoxious.
Another drunken google eyed weirdo wouldn't stop staring at my girlfriend. 
Weird vibe but food and drinks and bartender were cool."}
{"text":"Hamburger and French fries are the best!  Place is small, service is ok, but the burger can't be beat."}
{"text":"You must try the Shipley burger. Best burger and fries we've ever had.  They cook everything to order on a grill right behind the bar.  Casual but comfy atmosphere and a  favorite with locals and visitors."}
{"text":"Their Facebook page says they open at 10am every day, so we went for a morning motorcycle ride to Shipley's to beat the heat. They don't open until 11am, so we found a better bar in town."}
{"text":"5 stars! The best service we've had in Madison! Cass and Deb were attentive and great and hands down- THE BEST burger I can remember having !!  The couple next to us at the bar advised they live 40 min away and come every Friday for a few beers and THE BURGER!!! Juke box  was filled with great music- including Old Crow and .38 special...and they shared the wifi password- so nice and helpful- so I could Yelp review!!"}
