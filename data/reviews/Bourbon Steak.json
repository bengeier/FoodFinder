{"text":"We went to the burger bar at bourbon steak with 3 other couples after a day drinking and hanging out at the pool.  We were looking for a fun and simple dinner.

First of all the service was sooooo slow.  From the time we ordered our meals until the time the burgers showed up, over 90 minutes had elapsed.  We were there so long sitting on these hard wooden chairs that we were starting to get decubitus ulcers.

The drinks were good, made with high end ingredients.

As always, the duck fat French fry trio was Devine.

I was disappointed with the burgers.  It tasted fine, maybe  6/10.  But I ordered mine medium rare and it was rare... There was nothing medium rare about it.  I didn't bother sending it back because at that point we had been there over two hours and we just wanted to eat and get out.  Everyone at the table agreed that their burgers were under-cooked, so it wasn't just me.  If it takes 90 minutes to make a great burger, I'm ok with that, but it had better be on point, and this just wasn't.

One of my friends got the falafel burger and it was inedible.  It was hard and rubbery and you could barely even cut it with a steak knife.  For real.  I think that if Michael Mina knew that his name was attached to this hockey puck, he would be devastated.  It was that bad.

The adult milk shakes were really good.  If not for the milk shakes and fries, this would be zero stars instead of 2.

On this night, I wonder how the patrons in the main restaurant were enjoying their dinner?"}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner on the patio. Highly recommend the wagyu trio and asking for Logan as the server."}
{"text":"Awesome food, with service to match... As the saying goes you get what you pay for... This isn't McDonald's folks...  Come with money.."}
{"text":"Horrible. Expensive and nothing taste good.   We ordered two steaks and two sides, but they were disappointing"}
{"text":"Food delivered to table cold. Had a $165 porterhouse with my wife. Perfectly cooked but not hot and served sliced in a cold serving pan. Waiter offered to reheat. But who wants an overcooked, microwaved $165 steak. My son had the ribeye medium rare. Came out very rare. He did not want us to complain. Sides were not hot either. Waiter compted us our two deserts. Big deal on a $400 poorly delivered meal."}
{"text":"I went during restaurant week: 3 courses for $40 which made me smile.

Course 1- Duck Confit, elderberries, and cornbread with a side of French Fries fried in duck fat (paprika dusted with some bbq sauce, pepper dusted with aioli, and salted with ketchup.  This was the best course BY FAR.  These french fries were out of this world and the duck was as tender as osso buco.
Course 2- Flat Iron Steak cooked medium rare.  Very good piece of steak and they did the best with flat iron that I've ever head.
Course 3- Rocky Road Ice Cream with homemade marshmallows.  Great ending to a great meal.  Lighter than most chocolate desserts, which is fine by me.

Drinks- Were decent and this keeps it from getting 5 stars.  If I'm spending $16 for a cocktail, it better be incredible.  They were simply good.  I had mezcal & ginger beer, and a bourbon based drink."}
{"text":"This was good, not great and was a let-down from what I had expected in looking at the menu before coming to the restaurant.  Came here with a medium sized party for a birthday celebration.  The service was excellent, but the food wasn't worth the price tag in my opinion, hence the lower star rating.  We had people ordering the wagyu strip that were not impressed - if you're going to spend over $100 on a piece of meat when you add white truffles it BETTER be excellent, particularly when they sell you so hard on it.  Then got an overdone ahi tuna (which they did fix) and a dry pork chop (granted - the pork had to be ordered to well done for the person's food intake requirements at the time, absolutely nothing could be raw, but I can cook one at home that isn't raw or dry!).  the desserts were good, and i liked the mushroom soup.  Overall, this was good but didn't make it to our 'must visit again' spots."}
{"text":"Wonderful! This was our second trip to Bourbon steak and it was even better than I remember it! The appetizer menu is terrific. Try the ravioli and fondue, won't disappoint. The waygu challenge with both American and Japanese beef was both delicious and interesting. End with the peanut butter dark chocolate pretzel pie...so incredibly yummy!  The service was friendly and the executive chef came by to make sure we were loving our experience, we absolutely did. Michael Mina...you don't miss."}
{"text":"How do you go wrong with a French Pinot Noir, a pate appetizer, a tenderloin and a lobster side?  By eating here!!   This was, by far, the MOST expensive, WORST quality meal that my family have NOT enjoyed in a long, long time.  I had to send my steak back twice.  The second time they just brought my steak back and blamed the lighting.  Do not eat here unless you want to be RIPPED OFF!!!"}
{"text":"As many good things as I had heard about Bourbon Steak, I couldn't bring myself to try it when their prices make even Mastro's look reasonable. However, during the summer, they run a special $39 3-course Summer Menu that is a terrific value. They don't offer it automatically, though, so be sure to request it.

The restaurant is situated in the beautiful Fairmont Princess - valet is complimentary. The space is the steakhouse modernized - dark tones, warm lighting, top-40 and rock music. The service is terrific, from the hostess to the server to the GM. And the food is Michael Mina great. For a chef who has developed quite a large collection of restaurants across the country, his places never disappoint.

Bourbon Steak begins your meal with a trio of duckfat fries, \"compliments of the chef.\" This is the Holy Trinity of fries...true perfection, and far better a start to a meal than any bread could be, although they also brought us black truffle potato bread that was excellent. I can't speak to any of the dishes on the regular menu, but if you decide to try the Summer Menu, I highly recommend the date and mozzarella appetizer. We also had the calamari app, but it was a little disappointing - the jalapeño poppers it's served with were delicious, and the dipping sauce was great, but the calamari batter was a bit soggy. For entrees, both the short rib and the skirt steak were terrific - tender and flavorful, with not a bit of fat. I'd say the short rib was the slight favorite of the two. And I can only imagine how crazy good the chicken mac 'n' cheese is, but it seemed a little too indulgent for such a big meal. Finally, both of the desserts - the passion fruit panna cotta and the Greek yogurt parfait - were fantastic. The perfect light and refreshing ending to the meal. If you're only getting one, it just depends on whether you like something a little more tart (the panna cotta) or sweeter (the parfait).

I'm thrilled they have this summer deal to allow diners who might otherwise be frightened off by the prices to give them a try. While I probably won't be back anytime soon without a corporate expense account, I'd say Bourbon Steak should be up there with Mastro's and J&G (which, of the three, is the best value, IMO) as the Valley's finest steakhouses."}
{"text":"Bourbon Steak, chef Michael Mina's 12th restaurant, is scheduled to open officially on Feb 11th at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess. $6.9 million is said to have been invested into this NY-style American steakhouse, featuring such premium cuts as Japanese \"A5\" Kobe beef filet mignon priced just under $200.

Last night, we had the honor of being invited to their first preview hosted by FBR.  As we walked in through the foyer flanked by floor to ceiling rows of glorious wine, we got a glimpse of chef Mina autographing his cookbook for a guest but that was the last we saw of him.  The space has a very masculine NY monochromatic decor befitting a steakhouse.

Prior to dinner, we were offered kobe sliders, which were a bit messy as finger food and looked better than they tasted.  Servers also offered us a choice of sauv blanc or the 2003 Silver Oak Cab.  

As we pondered over the menu, a trio of duck fat fries with a trio of sauces and focaccia in a large cast iron pan were brought to our table.  Honestly, I could not taste the difference with the duck fat but the truffle cream sauce was very good.  The focaccia would have benefited from more olive oil and herbs.  

First course was the bibb wedge salad - three wedges of the lettuce served on a bed of avocado puree and topped with Oregon smokey blue cheese and bacon bits.  The bibb lettuce was sweet and crisp contrasting nicely with the intensity of the savory blue cheese.  The avocado didn't contribute much except to hold the wedges in their place. 

For mains, we were offered a choice of wood-grilled chicken, miso-glazed black cod, and all-natural filet mignon.  All were served with foraged mushrooms, truffled mac & cheese (oddly with bits of broccoli florets) and creamed spinach.  

Btw, what does all-natural mean?  As opposed to part artificial elsewhere?  And while I'm at it, did the captain really have to explain that foraged means wild?

Nobody at our table ordered chicken so I can't comment on it.  The filet mignon was of course tender and surprisingly flavorful given the cut - it was probably slow-cooked at a low temperature and then quickly seared on the grill to give it the nice crust.    The cod, a classic Japanese preparation made popular by Nobu, was the most moist and flaky version I've ever tasted.  Unfortunately the heavy sides did not pair as well with the fish as they did with the steak.

The forager of the mushrooms will be disappointed to hear that their hard work was wasted.  The mushrooms were undercooked - still containing a lot of their moisture and acidity.

Three other sides were brought in cast iron pans to the table for sharing - marble potatoes Lyonnaise (baby black and white potatoes with caramelized onions - delicious), sour cream & onion potato puree (this was way too wet - almost soupy), and glazed baby carrots.

Everyone at the table found the food to be overly salted, probably compounded by the heaviness of each side.  Feeling a bit laden, we hoped for some brighter tastes in our dessert.

Alas it was not to be.  Beignets, churros and doughnuts:  I challenge you to find a heavier combination.  
- The beignets were served with a trio of pot de creme - vanilla creme brulee, chocolate and the highlight an 18-yr Macallan butterscotch.
- The citrus churros were served with a shot of Mexican spiced hot chocolate.  
- The doughnuts with half a caramelized banana and cinnamon ice cream.

The doughy fried concoctions would probably have been delicious on their own but all together they were too alike.  The ice cream flavored with ground cinnamon was gritty and overpowering.  Would have been much better if they had used cinnamon sticks to flavor their mix and strained it out before churning.

Bourbon Steak still has a quite a few kinks to work out before their opening in less than 2 weeks.  With almost $7 million invested, I have no doubt that they will deserve 5 stars when that happens."}
{"text":"Nice Resort steakhouse. Food is good. I wouldn't rate this say on a Mastro's level although it seemed to be our waiter was trying to make us think we were there, but in general the place is just ok."}
{"text":"I'm giving Bourbon Steakhouse only 2 stars because of the service. My husband and I were there on Dec. 22nd to celebrate my birthday.  It wasn't busy since our reservations were at 6 p.m. but we waited 10 minutes for menus, then waited to order drinks and water. Our food order was taken but another 20 minutes before we were served the delicious fries. The meals were fantastic but another half an hour went by before we were able to order additional drinks and ask for more water! When the drinks arrived 20 minutes later, the ice was melted! No one ever came by to ask if we needed anything! We had to ask a busboy to find our waiter so we could get the check! When you spend $250 you'd think they'd pay closer attention to the customer."}
{"text":"We made the last-minute decision to come here for Christmas dinner without a reservation (scary!) but we called ahead to make sure the lounge (first come first serve) was going to be open. We went in around 5:15 and there was only one other party in the lounge.

The service was amazing, they were extremely accommodating of our toddler (the waiter even offered to bounce her while we ate) and the food was fantastic.

They gave us free duck fat fries... they will change your life.

We ordered from the dinner menu. My fiance and I split the wedge salad, I had the scallops, he had a steak and we both shared the broccolini and the truffle mac and cheese. Everything was SO good.

My ONLY con is that the drinks were a little weaker than we would have liked but we will definitely be back to try the lounge menu. Perfect Christmas dinner!"}
{"text":"Best thing about the experience was the hotel's valet parking...
Messed-up our reservation, wanker of a waiter, airport cafeteria decorating, limited menu (although the filet was just fine), waaay overpriced wine list, and a dreadful interpretation of carrot cake for desert."}
{"text":"If it's duck-fat fries and Martinis that meet your fancy, then I'd recommend Bourbon Steak. Unfortunately, my experience went downhill from here. Service was so-so, wait time from sitting down was extensive as it seemed to take forever to bring a cocktail and guests shouldn't have to remind the waiter to bring wine at a restaurant of this caliber.  Nothing to write home about for the rest of the dining experience. Wedge salad was good but nothing special (nobody seems to beat Fleming's in this arena) and the rib-eye steak was dry and lacked of flavor (unless \"charred\" is the flavor you are looking for). Creamed spinach with smoked onion was good, but not remarkable. And despite sharing that we were celebrating our first wedding anniversary, there was nary a mention or any recognition of the event (although it may not be their thing). And to top it all off, the toilet in the men's room had previously overflowed, leaving a wading pool of enjoyment during my visit. Not what I'd expect from a four-diamond establishment and not a spot I'd heartily recommend or return to anytime soon."}
{"text":"Im not even sure where to begin on this one.  This was the best dining experience of my life.  And yes it was a dining experience.  Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable.  Not to mention perfectly attentive.  The duck fat fries were the perfect start to the night which got better with the king fish sashimi (huge chunks of fresh fish with jalapenos!) and the lobster grilled cheese with tomato soup (more lobster would have been appreciated).  After that we sampled the bread (saving room for entrees) and were very impressed by its light texture (must have been the potato flour).  I had the ribeye cap (BEST STEAK EVER) and my husband had the tapioca crusted snapper (he loved it).  I would highly recommend getting the ribeye cap as it is a cut of meat you cant find elsewhere and you dont even have to work to eat it -- there is no fat to cut off!  It is all the flavor of the ribeye without any work! :)  
The wine list was great.  I really appreciated the range of bottle price ($28-2008) and was even happier when the waiter didnt scoff at my choice of a $42 bottle.  
For dessert we had the beinets with the vahlrona pot de creme and it was perfect.  FYI: the beniets tasted great reheated the next morning so dont be afraid to get them to go."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was top notch. From the moment you get your car valeted and walk through the long picturesque walkway to the low-lit insides and the home-style bathrooms (clothes towels!), this place screams class and enjoyment. And that's just the atmosphere.
The food was ridiculously good. Duck Fat Fries were amazing (white sauce is to die for...). We got the truffled mac cheese with broccoli which was so good and creamy, and the creamed spinach was equally good. We were lucky enough to get a bottle of Cliff Lede cabernet from 2006. It's the type of wine you drink that makes you truly appreciate a good quality wine. That paired excellently with the 10 oz Filet Mignon. It was prepared with perfect. Nice and slightly crispy on the outside and smooth and juicey on the inside. To top it off the Chocolate Molten cake was a perfect end to an unforgettable meal. The staff was also extremely accommodating and very informative. 
The bottom line is this place is awesome. You go here to drop some serious coin to live like a king for a few hours. Definitely the type of place you tell your friends about just to make them jealous..."}
{"text":"From start to finish, one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a really long time.  Perhaps it's my fault for going during restaurant week, but then again, the place wasn't even crowded.  
     The first sign of trouble was the waiter taking twenty minutes to take our cocktail order.  He returned after thirty minutes (no hyperbole here) to bring us the cocktails and tell us the bottle of wine we'd chosen was out of stock.  It would be another twenty minutes before the waiter visited again to take our order.  Were it not for the amuse bouche of french fries, we may have starved.  
     Then the fire alarm went off and I thought we'd have to evacuate.  This would have been the best thing that could have happened, but it stopped.
     Finally, our salads arrived.  I had what I believe they call the bibb lettuce salad and it was uninspiring, a chunk of lettuce with an inadequate amount of blue cheese and bacon on top.  
     The next forty, yes FORTY, minutes were the longest of my life.  I queried the waiter twice as to what might be going on in the kitchen to delay our steaks for so long. We were ready to get up and leave when I asked to see the manager, who finally sauntered over just as the meal arrived.  He had the waiter pour us each a glass of muscat \"for our trouble.\"  Gee, thanks for the desert wine.  
     The flavor of the steak was good, but would have been much better, had it not been cold upon arrival, and if I hadn't been cutting it with a dull knife.  At this point, we'd been there close to three hours and I was really just ready to go.  
     I've really never had an experience where the wait staff seemed so clueless and inept.  Based on so many good reviews, I have to think this was an off night for Bourbon Steak, but I won't be back.  A sincere apology  and a few cocktails on the house might have gone a long way toward making the wait more tolerable.
     If you want a good steak in Scottsdale/Phoenix, go to Mastro's, City Hall, or Ocean Club.  They are on their game 100% of the time."}
{"text":"The food was pretty average for an \"upscale\" steak house.  Menu is limited for people who don't want to pay a car payment for dinner.  Spending over 200 for 2 filet and two sides that were \"ok\". Filet was served on a cold plate middle was barely warm and barely seasoned. Mashed potatoes were nothing fancy.  Everything at this resort is overpriced."}
{"text":"The value is simply not there. My wife and I had dinner and I can honestly say you pay at least double what it's worth, for a simple meal with entree, one glass of wine with a side and dessert. Add a few more items and you getting a whopping bill. 

The steak is good, not great compared to the many steak restaurants in the area. The service was good but the food was served very fast as if we were in a diner. Taken altogether the atmosphere was great, food is average, and cost for the complete package excessive - unless you are on someone's expense account."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service - Jeremy is a star - our kids loved the service and surprises!"}
{"text":"Service and food were excellent. Sat on outside patio with cool ambiance ... love the light fixtures.

The \"amuse\" is a trio of fries (paprika dusted with bbq sauce, black pepper dusted with a garlic aioli and salted with roasted onion ketchup).

I started with the sweet garlic soup with fried meyer lemon, artichoke barigoule and ricotta gnudi ... fantastic combination of textures and flavors ... 

My husband started with the seared foie gras with white chocolate and other delectables ... he loved it.  He also very much enjoyed his perfectly cooked flat iron steak and truffle mac and cheese.

I ordered 6 ounces of the A5 Wagyu cooked rare to medium-rare and it was simply outstanding ... red and warm in the middle with a crisp outer sear ... so buttery with marbling ... probably could have ordered 4 to 5 ounces as it does get a bit rich ... the sides (broccolini, white cheddar hashbrowns and sauteed spinach, unfortunately were a disappointment, the first two being bland and the last overly seasoned).

Enjoyed an extremely nice bottle of 2009 DRC Vosne-Romanee.  Nice wine list.

Parting gift from Chef Mina's crew here are little bags of caramel corn."}
{"text":"I was here a few months back. I had the 3oz  Kobe beef which was the best beef I have ever had but it was over $100 we also had the Mac and cheese, it was so rich I could only take a few bites. For dessert we ate the bread pudding which I was completely underwhelmed by. My husband had eaten earlier in the day so he only had a salad and we each had an alcoholic drink. The beef was definitely the star of the night. Our bill was 200 before tips."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic time.  Staying at the hotel and wanted to watch the game.  Crystal behind the bar was fantastic and I could not recommend the restaurant and Crystal enough!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a five, Steaks are prepared perfect. They have some great specials. I had the wagyu rib cap, it melts in your mouth.  Great service, if you want a lighter meal sit at the bar and get a burger or fish tacos. Yes the duck fat fries are great, The only reason i didn't give a five(would do 4.5) was because of the sides, the house potato dish is ok at best and the jalapeno corn, was terrible. Other than that it was perfect, I will eat there again and I have loved every Michael Mina restaurant  that I have been to.  They do have a great wine list, a tad on the expensive side. But they do have a couple of great tempranillos."}
{"text":"Food was a C- at best!  Server never told us we would be paying $8 a bottle for water.  No wonder the busboy kept filing up the glasses.  Cesaer salad had no taste, the fried chicken was dry and the macaroni and cheese was more like a soup.   Oh by the way--the menu says whole chicken but you only get one drumstick and breast!
Overpriced wine list .  Not a good experience.  Finally, the seats were uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I will have to disagree with many of the previous writers here.  I have been to Michael Minna in San Francisco, which is way more famous and crowded but this one is better.  Let's begin with something that impressed me.  When my partner and I sat down, someone came over and immediately handed her a black cloth napkin.  Sounds simple, but it's nice when you have nice black pants on and don't want white crap all over them.  Second, the food was great.  The duck fries were really good (and free)... I had a great corn chowder with cilantro and a small grilled cheese sandwich which was perfect. (I never eat those). My main course was a skirt steak in a fantastic sauce.  My dessert was beignets and creme brulee.  The beignets were great and the creme brulee was good.  (My gf makes it much better)...we each had two drinks, a pear martini which was excellent and an even better white cosmo.  All in all, the food was tasty and the appearance of the place was nice and swanky.  It's about time Scottsdale started opening restaurants that can compete with S.F. and NY."}
{"text":"The bar is very nice and serves a great martini.  After that, it's downhill.

We waited for service as the couple next to us was seated, was brought an amuse bouche and ordered.  We still had not heard from our waiter.  We finally flagged down someone and they made a half hearted attempt to serve us and brought us menus.  At that point, we should have left.  But we did not.  Wanting this to be good, we preserved and waited for our waiter  to have some free time for us.  

When he finally did show, he was abrupt and obviously slammed.

Since none of us drank the same wine, we each ordered by the glass.  This did not seem to amuse our waiter in the least.

The steak was average...maybe below average for the price.  I left half my steak (which I NEVER have done before) on the plate and our waiter did not ask if we enjoyed our dinners.  This is inexcusable.  He did have the decency to not ask us if we wanted deserts.  The check, I might add, was brought promptly.  I could not help but wish I had gone to Mastros or Oceans - or the TPC Grill.

Bottom line - If you can entertain your waiter by placing an order for an expensive bottle of wine and meet his schedule for getting your order in, you stand a chance of having a very expensive about or below average dinner.  (Read expense account on boondogle)."}
{"text":"Three words mean big flavor at the Fairmont Scottsdale's, Michael Mina group restaurant: DRY AGED BEEF. Without explaining the chemical process to my vegan friends, just take my word for it and recommend this place to steak lovers everywhere! Comfort food with a twist finds an Arizona chic home in Mina's, Bourbon Steak. Sirloin, Ribeye, Filet Mignon, you name it, you can get your 'carne' on here! Appetizers are served family style; meant for sharing. Try the trio of duck-ft fries. The dipping sauces alone will haunt you for years to come! Does your mouth water for mashed potatoes and mac n' cheese? Yes? You will light  up like a Christmas tree after sampling the elegant and satisfying horseradish mashed potato puree or truffled macaroni and cheese. Asparagus served with orange zest and parmesan shavings is in a word, transcendent. ( I can still feel the heads of those green stalks snapping satisfyingly in my mouth!) 
Add in an impressive wine list and the sleek, black, leather, contemporary feel of the glassy candlelight and diners are literally forking over their wallets for an experience. This venue is not for the budget minded. At Bourbon Steak you will pay for the quality and innovation proffered. My advice: pay willingly. You will NOT be disappointed! Cost is not a factor when the value of this dining room is felt full-force. Trust me, when you have eaten a 14 oz. dry-aged sirloin with the accompaniments described and then polish off a made to order dark chocolate creme brulee with homemade beignets reminiscent of Cafe du Monde in the French Quarter, you will be thanking your fairy godmother for this chance to eat like a prince or princ-ess if the slipper fits!"}
{"text":"Husband and I were not impressed with the food.  He ordered the ribeye and I ordered the duck.  The duck was disappointing.  It was not as tender as other places I've been.  Husbands steak was cooked well but flavor and and tenderness was not there.  We were in a large party which may have compromised the food quality.  we were sorry to he disappointed since the restaurant had high expectations."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best steaks ever. Had the Rib Eye, and my wife had the Wagyu Filet. Just incredible. Service was exceptional, and giving it 4 stars only because of the wine list. While we are no strangers to spending $100 on the right bottle of wine, 90% of all wine selections were $100 and up, including many familiar selections that were 30-40% higher that other high end establishments. Other than the wine list, this place is excellent."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about my dinning experience at Bourbon Steak but I'll highlight just a few things. Service was great, Jeremy and the whole team were supper attentive and detailed. Food was excellent, we went for the filet mignon, I like it medium and it was cooked to perfection. For sides we order the truffled mac and cheese and the baked potato, both delicious but the later was our favorite. Dessert was my favorite part, their cheesecake was decadent and the Bourbon Bar is a must for chocolate fans. When you come visit request Jeremy to be your server, he is a rockstar!"}
{"text":"Whether you are staying at the luxurious Fairmont Princess, or just visiting Phoenix / Scottsdale, you won't find a better restaurant than Bourbon Steak.  My wife and I shared: an 8 oz rare Filet Mignon, baked potato, delicious Brussels sprouts, and a Farmer's salad.  Bourbon Steak gladly split the entire order, and threw in French Fries to boot!  It was more than enough food for two.  Bourbon Steak has now displaced Maestros, Ruth's Chris, and LG as our #1 restaurant for steak!  There really is a difference in their Mesquite Grilled steak.  Equally important, the friendly, personalized service from Stephanie made this a very special night.  The key to success for Bourbon Steak: the entire staff was equally attentive to back-up Stephanie and make sure our dinner was an experience to remember.  5 stars for Stephanie, the chef, and the other staff members at Bourbon Steak!   Don & Fay, Hermosa Beach, CA"}
{"text":"My husband, some friends and I went to this place for restaurant week. We all sampled different dishes to experience a range of items - the multi-flavored french fries, soups, steaks and desserts. While everything we sampled was good, I was not blown away. My steak was good, but not great, and considering the regular prices, great should be on the menu. Also, the restaurant is one main room with hardwood floors, effectively creating an echo-chamber. This is one of my major restaurant pet peeves - you sit down at a nice dinner only to have to yell across the table. I expected more from Michael Mina and certainly for the celebrity chef-inspired prices. A better steak, and better experience, can certainly be had for less."}
{"text":"A big shout out to Mike, the stupendously stellar bar manager.  I will be back to discuss the history of Vodka.

Thank you to restaurant GM, Anibal, who stopped by to see us not once, but twice.  Enjoyed the education regarding the secretive life of truffles. 

Aaron, the fantastically knowledgeable Sommelier, had me paired with excellent wine suggestions with only a few hints of my picky palette.  

Appreciated the Manger of Stone Rose, Sam,  coming all the way over from the other side to dropped in and sat with us to chat about upcoming events.

Can't wait to go back to try out there new bar bite menu in 2 weeks, and take advantage of the locals' secret  1/2 off bottle night on Tuesdays from there amazingly huge book of wines to choose from.  

Thanks again everyone: you made a potentially disastrous date night from visiting an establishment previous which (to say the least) did not go well, into a very enjoyable and fun evening."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service, it was spotted at best. The  rib eye was just plain bad.
and the overall experience was not nice...sorry"}
{"text":"We decided to give Bourbon Steak a try during restaurant week - why not?  The place has an amazing entry, but then a fairly blah interior once you're inside. Our biggest complaint was their music selection and volume level - think Beastie Boys. We are in our 30s so it's not that we are old, but it is supposed to be a high end restaurant experience. 

We found the service to be solid and friendly. They were always coming by to see how things were going and offer refills. 

The food was good, but short of exceptional. Perhaps it's the restaurant week offerings, but their goal is to attract new customers, right?  The duck fat fries were yummy.

So we would come back, but we have many other steak houses to try first."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with family from out of town on Friday night.  First, I am a big fan of steak joints, and second, I am a big fan of Michael Mina, so I was really excited.  Yeah, yeah, the fries are great, but you could probably fry shoelaces in duck fat and they would be tasty- bottom line, how was the steak?  Answer:  Pretty good, but it did not blow me away.  I had the ribeye, because that is my measure of a place and it was, well, pretty darn good.  What did blow my doors off was the prices of wine, or in this case, whine.  Our wine tab came to $350 for one ok bottle and one very tasty bottle.  However, I could have re-created that for about $75 bucks at Bevmo and costco.  I mean, I get it- super swank wine display, big name chef owner, but seriously.  Really good food- go for the lamb, but not quite worth the $$$$."}
{"text":"I had just moved to the Phoenix area for my husband's job, so he wanted to treat me to something special, and it was something special indeed. The experience starts with driving up the the front of the Fairmont hotel grounds, which even at night is impressive. The restaurant interior was hip and tasteful with plenty of mood lighting. We sat in the bar area because the ambiance seemed nicer there, so I never actually sat in the main dining area, although I think we made a good choice. True to being a Michael Mina restaurant, the service and food were both impeccable. Enough with the restaurant description and on to the food!

We wanted to be able to stuff ourselves with meat, so we avoided getting appetizers, but we received a complimentary trio of fries with different seasonings (normal, garlic, and cajun) and dips, and fresh, hot buttery (or olive oily?) foccacia served in the cast iron pan it was baked it. So yummy! I got the special cut of beef of the day...I can't quite recall what it was, but I remember the server describing they kept the fat cap on it? I think it was some version of a NY strip. My husband got the filet mignon. Both were perfectly cooked to order,  incredibly flavorful and tender. We didn't get the kobe...but I can't imagine that t could be that much better for the price, but then what do I know. Along with the meat, we ordered several of the sides. I love mac & cheese...and when they have truffled mac & cheese, well that just makes a delicious treat so much better! You can really taste the truffle, which gave the mac & cheese an additional rich, earthy flavor. I want to go back just for the mac & cheese...well, and for everything else too, but especially the mac & cheese. We also got the soy marinated shitake mushrooms and the broccolini (in order to have that nutritionally balanced meal...) which were surprisingly tasty despite not having any meat or cheese involved. 

Unfortunately we were so full that we didn't order dessert, which I know is a crying shame. But that is another reason why we'll definitely be going back. Those beignets sound delicious! I've been to the Michael Mina restaurant in San Francisco, and although these are totally different restaurants and styles, the dedication to food and service are obvious in both of them. And compared to the SF restaurant, this place was a real bargain...heh heh, which I know isn't saying much. Definitely not your casual date restaurant, but not a bad 'convince your wife that she didn't make a mistake leaving the Bay Area for Phoenix to join her husband' restaurant."}
{"text":"While the ambiance is lovely, the food was not what I expected.  For $79 for rib eye, I expected it to melt in my mouth and amaze my taste buds.  I found it to be very bland and a bit rubbery.  The organic mushrooms were good.   Service was decent.  But honestly and with all due respect, the food just wasn't great."}
{"text":"Went to Bourbon Steak tonight and \"Meh\" pretty much sums it up. 

Duck fat fries - stone cold, mildly interesting dipping sauces, dipped in cornstarch or some other material to produce a false crispiness. Had one and done. 

Burrata cheese appetizer: The small amount of cheese that I received was delicious but hey, it's Burrata. Tomato jam that I needed a microscope to see, not olives but an olive tapenade - that was pretty good, lemon preserve that had no business whatsoever on the plate, white bread \"insides\" that had been pulled out in fluffy balls and lightly toasted (there is a fine line between creativity and idiocy - a flavorless slightly toasted white bread falls to the idiocy side) and a few random sprigs of frisee. 

Oysters, they only had Fanny Bay tonight - prepared well and enjoyable. 

Filet - mine was flavorless (despite the strong mesquite smell), fatty and so severely undercooked from the medium I requested that the cook (and I mean cook, not chef) in the kitchen here should be ashamed. 

Husbands filet was medium rare and was cooked slightly more than mine - he said it was a good steak but not anywhere near the level of a Mastros. To me, that is the understatement of the century (see my Mastros review). 

White cheddar hashbrowns: Three small undercooked grated potato hockey pucks each with three specks of bacon and a flavorless cheddar. 

Wine list - extensive for bottles but not impressive, by the glass was a joke. 

All for under $250 so I can't complain about the price but in this case, you get what you (don't) pay for. 

If I recover from the temporary deafness caused by their blasting of Sirius 20 on 20 combined with the off the charts volume of the dining room, I might call to complain about the experience. 

I won't even bother complaining about the service, it wasn't bad - more like a time share pitch. 

To add insult to lousy dining, we caught the valet whipping my AMG around the parking lot before bringing it to the front. 

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Dined on a Thursday evening with a reservation. Asked hostess to be seated away from a table full of kids. Instead was seated directly beside them. When asked if we could be seated elsewhere on the inside of the restaurant (an entire section was available) we were told it was impossible because they were trying to keep that section closed. It is a shame when staff is inconvenienced by customers...having to support two sections.). 

We were seated outside instead. Not my favorite way to dine, but better than the kid zone. 

The food was underwhelming. The carrots were inedible. (We argued a long time about the best descriptor....this was the only one polite enough to use.). The porterhouse for two was average. The mashed potatoes were the star of the show. 

We won't be returning. Much better options for food and service in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Its pricy.  but I expected that.  Atmosphere is better than the food and I have had better steaks for the price.   Service is awesome and everyone was very friendly."}

{"text":"I recommend this place for a dinner and was so disappointed.  Order a $79 steak and it was cold.  Sent it back and it came back tough. Did not want to be that guy but this place is off the list.  For the price you don't get the value, just go to Maestros."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dining experience on March 8th!   We had a party of 12, and sat at the Chef's Table .  It was our first experience and we will go back!

The food, ambience, and level of service were all terrific!  Any special requests were handled properly and cheerfully.
We were not rushed in any way, and were given a perfect mix of privacy and good service.  Our guests all were happy and pleased with their selections.   Thank you Bourbon Steak for making our evening memorable..."}

This is really something special, not your run-of-the-mill steakhouse, like we have all over town. 

If you're a wine lover and want to experience something unique, go to Bourbon Steak. Their Somm has a vast variety for the wine enthusiast. I mean, really cool stuff, not just the labels people order to be seen drinking expensive wine. 

The Fairmont Princess is a gorgeous property. Perfect pairing. 

Well done, Michael Mina. Well done."}

Our waiter Todd did a incredible job,  our family enjoy the evening and are thankful to Todd for making these happen. Food delicious and amazing customer service. Great restaurant"}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant is awesome. Along with awesomeness comes a huge bill at the end. When I say huge, if you are a normal person, it's huge. Maybe pocket change to some of the tech crowd and super rich, but the normal person, be prepared huge for final bill. I went to this place fully expecting 

I had the bone in ribeye and my wife had the filet mignon. The steaks were cooked to perfection. We shared the salted baked potato and the Mac and cheese. We also had the house Cesar salad. We also had a bottle of wine with dinner.

The Cesar salad is a standard salad and there was nothing really special about it. The mac and cheese was awesome! Probably the best I've ever had at an expensive restaurant. 

The salted baked potato was equality awesome. 

The steaks were cooked just as we liked it. The meat was tender and tasty. I had the special, the 12oz bone in ribeye for $69. The  20oz porterhouse is $157 and the 15oz strip is $82. I'm sure they are great, but I will never know. 

To top it off, we shared a piece of lemon cheesecake. Again, awesome. So rich and tasty. It's a must share. 

The wine! The lower priced bottles start at $140 and go up to about $1500 a bottle. The average price for a bottle is around $400 to $800. You can buy some wines by the glass, but a ball park price is about $40 a glass. 

Although I probably will never go back, if I struck it rich, I'd be there tomorrow.  

I'm not one who believes places that are expensive are great. And I have reviewed some places that were not worth their hype. This place is down right EXCELLENT! 

The staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go. The wife and I like to spend every chance we get here. The atmosphere is amazing, dark and romantic. They bring you their duck fat fries and they are to die for. All the entrees and desserts we have gotten have been top notch. Highly recommended for special occasions."}
{"text":"Would you be impressed if I told you we've been dining at home with elk burgers served with fries and black truffle aioli?  And then would you smirk when I admit the fries are from McD's drive thru and the aioli is jarred from William Sonoma ($18 soo good)?

Delicious meal and great ambiance... if I get an opp to hang at the Princess again, I'll humbly cut my cloth to fit my means when it's outside of Restaurant Week.  Catch me bellying up to the bar for a burger, trio of duckfat fries w/ the adored truffle dip, and finish w/ the 18 year old butterscotch pot de creme with beignets.

Unfortunately was not wow'd by the truffled mac and cheese, but I own a few bottles of truffle oil myself... I know what we'll be serving at home soon..."}
{"text":"Nothing short of amazing. The service is like nothing I have seen. Management was not only accommodating but stepped in and served tables as needed. Food was spectacular! Must order the grilled smoked Gouda and mushroom fondue as an appetizer.  The rest is up to you but nothing will disappoint."}
{"text":"On the food and service alone-5 stars. The wine pricing was a 0. Good wine list but cost structure was out of this world. In a high end steak house, I expect 2x retail. This place was about 4 times. My glass, which was $26 per glass retails for  $28/bottle. Obscene. Steaks were a little over priced as well. Snake river flat iron was great value and taste. That saved it. So if you want to overpay for good tasting food this is your place"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for my birthday this year.  It was alright....to be honest, I was expecting a little more for the money.  I did enjoy the fries they bring out when you first get there.  And the ambiance of the place is pretty cool....But, as far as the food goes..nothing too special for the price...good but not great.."}
{"text":"I am 85 years old and have eaten in the finest restaurants throughout the world.
This restaurant was the most expensive and  worst food experience I have ever had,
The filets were not even prime and not cooked properly I don't think they were even 8oz  as listed, the waiter should have been in a roadside diner. The salads and accompaniments were sub prime, and the bill over $200.00 was outrageous.
Not a top rated steakhouse......Will never go back.."}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary. We visited the spa first and ended our evening with a 9pm dinner here. They knew it was our anniversary and the chef sent out complimentary:
French fry trio tasting
Falafel tasting
Brussel sprouts 

It was amazing! Not just because it was free but was delicious and super thoughtful. We shared the wedge salad which wasn't memorable. However the filet was awesome. The whipped potatoes with gravy was spectacular. The crispy brussel sprouts were exceptional. For desert we opted for the beignets with the creme brûlée dip. It basically was like two desserts. 

The service was spot on. We sat outside. The patio was beautiful and the weather was perfect. It is pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try bourbon steak for a while now heard great things they were pretty much all right I would say the number one thing was there service I had a little problem because I didn't eat pork and I ordered something that had pork ask do not have pork in it but they brought it out I had pork in it so the server had it remade but the manager came over comp the appetizer and gave us two free desserts Way Beyond what he had to do great management server was very nice very well-informed and they bent over backwards to please the guest now for the food I had the octopus which that's what had pork with it that was quite good cooked perfectly tender and charred perfectly on the outside I ordered there ribeye steak which was good but not great I'm not a big butter suvi guy but it was so pretty decent had the beignets they are good especially with their chocolate caramel sauce so delicious their chocolate cake was good great presentation but maybe after eating the Beignets I was little sugar doubt and the limoncello is pretty damn good too definitely will be back"}

My filet with blue cheese was actually a 10. The wedge salad with the pickled red onions and their special blue cheese dressing was top notch. The toffee pudding for dessert was also a 10. Our petite Sarah is as also a 10. So that's a 30. Love this place"}
{"text":"Very good food and a lot of fun. We visit every time we come to Scottsdale!  Get the lobster pot pie!"}
{"text":"L says - \"Chef Jeremy's passion for food was on full display and it was a remarkable experience. This is the best steak in town.\"

J says- \"Anyone can put vegetables on a plate, but it takes a true chef to be up for the challenge of a 5 course vegan meal. It was the best meal yet.\" 

First Impression/ambiance
Nestled in the grounds of the Fairmont Princess, the restaurant was elegant and the outdoor booth was the perfect spot for date night. 

Drinks
The Sommelier was very helpful with the wine pairings.  He brought several wines and we couldn't go wrong with any of his choices. L went for a red and J went with a white. Sadly, we did not remember the brand. Both were very excellent! 

Food -
The first item brought to the table was a small portion of shoestring French fries with 3 different dipping sauces: a house made ketchup, an aioli, and a house sauce which appeared to be half of each of the previously mentioned sauces mixed. J stuck to the ketchup while L enjoyed all 3. The next item was an \"amuse Buche\" a steak tartar in endive for L and a vegan beet tartar with some strawberry balsamic reduction for J. J loved the creativeness of the chef and the beet tartar. The next course was a mushroom soup which the chef was kind enough to make a special vegan version for J. The soup was so delicate yet flavorful it was heaven in a bowl. L loves mushrooms so he was also very pleased. The next item was a strawberry basil granita to cleanse the palate. Both J and L thought this was very refreshing. Next was a salad course. J's salad was a fresh bed of mixed greens with shaved radish, cucumber and some lentils while L's was a mixed green with avocado. Both excellent options. The main dish was next. L had a phenomenal steak that with roasted cipolini onions with mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked to medium rare perfection and was so flavorful on its own without any sauce or condiments (just as a great steak should be). J was served a cauliflower steak with chimichurri sauce, crispy Brussels sprouts, green beans, zucchini ribbons, grapefruit segments and a red pepper coulis. Again, J was impressed. The attention to detail and the perfect combination of flavors was amazing. For dessert we chose a selection of house made vegan ice creams. 

Service
L called in advance and asked to talk to the Chef regarding J's particular diet. L left a voicemail and Chef Jeremy Macmillan returned his call a few hours later. It was a delightful conversation to say the least and L left the conversation excited with anticipation. Chef Jeremy said he was very excited for creating the menu and meeting us. Our hostess was very gracious and took us to a booth in a quiet area per L's request. The sommelier, as previously mentioned, knew the ins and outs of wine and learning about the regions from each wine offered was a treat. The servers were very attentive to our waters and our plates. Chef Jeremy came out to greet us towards the end of our meal to check up on us and made sure we were taken care of. It was a pleasure meeting you kind sir! Overall service was top notch as expected from a fine dining restaurant. Michael Mina, you have a great chef at your disposable! We will certainly be back to see what else Chef Macmillan has cooked up his sleeve."}
{"text":"We have been many times with family and friends.  We have never been disappointed.  The service was always spot on, with friendly greetings from Kenny, Donald, Krystal, Saige, and Una.  
The food is always delicious.  I get the meatballs off the bar menu they are so good the sauce they put on them is great.  My husband had the Lobster potpie once and he said it was fantastic.  
We usually take the grand kids at Christmas time to see all the festive lights and going stuff they have at the resort then pop in to get a bite to eat at the bar.  They treat the kids very well.
I would recommend this place for a date night, a family night or a place to meet friends."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal from start to finish!  The Last Word was a very refreshing and different cocktail.  Every menu item was wonderful,from the oysters, grilled octopus, to the Caesar salad, to the seafood sampler, to the waygu  beef with bernaisse sauce and foie gras. The bourbon bar was a wonderful dessert.  Pricey, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Our waiters Logan and Todd were amazing. I love this place I'm definitely coming back the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Our family of 6 had New Years Eve 2015 dinner at this establishment.
Our server Micheal was nothing short of spectacular.
The meal fell quite a bit short.
The lack of meal choices was disappointing to all.
The real problem however, was after completing dinner, we were all enjoying our wine and conversation when the Manager came to our table, asked how our meal was, and then suggested we all proceed out to the New Years Eves party being thrown by the hotel.
We told him we were still finishing our wine, and he then told us we could just finish our wine out at the party and became more forceful in his mannerisms, and made the comment we needed to move out to the party which was outside in 32 degree temps  raining, and nobody there with the exception of Josh the Bartender who took our family photo.
This place is NOT worth the $250.00 per person cost for dinner by any stretch of the imagination.
May I suggest if you are looking for an excellent steak house Dominicks in Scottsdale is a great place to visit with many choices for each individuals palate."}
{"text":"Big groups can be tough but last nights dinner was a disaster. TERRIBLE service is an understatement. Waiter took advantage and \"suggested\" seafood towers to one of the ladies and 4 appeared, so $400 wasted. 4 hours and $6000 later we finally we're done. I would suggest IN N Out instead of this joke of a restaurant. The Fairmont should be embarrassed. If you have a bad experience do not bother talking to the managers because they are pathetic."}
{"text":"When I found out this was a Michael Mina restaurant, I was expecting a quality experience and meal.  My expectations were met. The meal was great from beginning to end.  Our waiter was excellent and very knowledgeable about the menu.  We had five people in our group so we shared a number of the sides including the beets and the mushrooms. I had the strip steak cooked medium and the flavor was fantastic. Three members of our group had the filet mignon and recommend it.  For dessert, we had the beignets and the bourbon bar. The bourbon bar was my favorite.  I am looking forward to my next visit to a Michael Mina restaurant."}
{"text":"Steakhouses are a dime a dozen where I live, so on a recent trip to Scottsdale, when friends suggested this for dinner it had a high bar to get over, as I've been to some of the best steakhouses in the country. 

We arrived on time for our reservation. There were 5 of us so when the host showed us to our seat, imagine my surprise when the table had only been set for 4. We stood awkwardly around until the host grabbed a chair from a nearby table and we all moved around to make room. Eventually a bus boy also grabbed a place setting from a nearby table. We were not off to a good start. This should never happen in a fine dining restaurant. 

Once we got settled with drinks in hand, a server brought out three kinds of fries with three sauces as a little appetizer for the table. Quite tasty and much appreciated as we were all starving. 

The sommelier, Aaron, was quite good. We told him what our favorite wine was, and while they didn't carry it, he did find another Cabernet that was very good and actually made it on my list to have again. 

The menu is set up with a cold shellfish section, first courses, specialties of the house and a more typical steakhouse menu with a range of steaks and sides. 

We chose from each with some wins and losses along the way. The wins? The fresh oysters that change daily, the heirloom tomato and burrata salad, and the wedge salad were some of the best starters. For entrees- you can't go wrong with any of the steaks. All were perfectly prepared and the specialty lamb chops were also good. 

The absolute best thing that we ordered was the lobster pot pie with truffle cream. This comes out in a copper baking pot with the crust on. They cut the crust off, placing it on your plate and then proceed to spoon the lobster and vegetables on top of it. Absolutely amazing! 

On a side note -if you like lobster- don't order the poached lobster. It was way over cooked and so tough that we could not get a knife through it. They did end up taking this off of our bill, but again- surprising for a restaurant of this caliber to so over cook something. 

And a couple of the sides ended up disappointing as well. The asparagus was thick and a weird flavor from the olives and herbs surrounding it. And the hash brown cakes? Dry with the only flavor coming from the bacon that was on top of it. 

But save room for dessert (in fact- this is so good you might just want to start with it) They have in house made beignets with three kinds of dipping sauce. Forget the chocolate and creme brulee dip. Only order the 18 year old real scotch butter scotch pudding dip. Absolutely the most amazing flavor! It makes any other pudding seem like, well secondary. 

Service was efficient but not overly friendly. The bus boy was actually more helpful and pleasant and it was nice to hear him talk about the career path that this restaurant has for their employees. 

Know before you go that this is not a cheap date. Dinner with wine and tip for 5 ran almost $700. For that kind of money, I really expected more than I got thus the lower rating. 

A-OK sums it up perfectly. It was fine but I just don't think this will go on my list to tell people to check out."}
{"text":"Took a group here while I was at a conference. This place had a wonderful atmosphere but service was inconsistent. Think there was a large party of 25 that may have contributed to the delay.  The majority of the table went with the tried and true Filet Mignon.  The filet was cooked perfect for everyone which is a hard task to accomplish. The side were enough for the table to share. The mashed potatoes were whipped perfectly.  Presentation was top of the line.  Drink choices were a little more limited than other places at the resort.  Everyone skipped the dessert as there was nothing over the top that was worth the calories.  Overall I would say if a steak is what you are looking for this is your place!!!"}
{"text":"After wanting to try Bourbon Steak for months, we finally went for Restaurant Week.  I wasn't sure how far $29 pp was going to get you at a Michael Mina restaurant, but I was pleasantly surprised.  First off, I am not a fan of hotel restaurants, but I immediately forgot my location once we walked in the entrance.  The place had a great vibe and if the weather would have been a bit cooler, we would have wanted to sit on their awesome patio.

Straight out of the gate, they brought the french fries that I had read so much about.  Three different seasonings....three different sauces....and fried in duck fat.....(cue the Homer Simpson drool sound.)  Amazing.  This was followed by freshly baked focaccia bread, served right in a mini cast iron skillet.

I went with the Corn Soup and Jalapeno Grilled Jack Sandwich appetizer, followed with the Skirt Steak main course, and finished with the still hot Beignets.  Every bite was amazing and I was sorry for it all to end.

Our server was extremely knowledgeable an enthusiastic about the food as well.  The only black mark I would give the restaurant was their very poor selection of vodka.

Still the meal left me wondering why it had taken me so long to try Bourbon Steak and definitely has me making plans to go back soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Bourbon Steak for Restaurant and had a very lovely time.  

For starters, the service was spectacular.  The waiters came by regularly refilling water glasses and drink orders.  The bartender was extremely friendly and knowledgeable, he made excellent recommendations and mixed a mean Manhattan.

The restaurant was a bit loud and dark, but we were in good company and unaffected by our surroundings.

The meal started with complimentary Duck Fat french fries served three ways.  These were delicious and a great start to a wonderful meal.  There was also some sponge bread which was alright, but not spectacular.  

I ordered the Lobster and Corn Bisque, Kobe Flat Iron Steak and 18 Year Butterscotch Pot de Creme with beignets.

The soup was tasty, the sweetness of the corn and lobster paired well with the spicy apples.  There was also a corn bread fritter which added nice texture to the soup.

I thought the Kobe flat iron was delicious and prepared very well.  It was paired with bone marrow mashed potatoes and onions prepared three ways.  The dish was delicious and well rounded.

The desert was fabulous.  The butterscotch pot de creme had just the right amount of bitterseet UMPH.  The beignets added a nice sweet balance to the creme.

All in all we had a fantastic experience.  I don't know that I would come here and pay full price, but I was extremely satisfied with my $39 meal."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had a belated Valentine's dinner here on Saturday night and it was the best upscale meal I've had since being back in AZ, hands down. 

I'll preface by saying that I am not usually a huge fan of steakhouses - they're a bit of a hard sell for me because they're generally uncreative and they just don't try very hard. However, Bourbon Steak has been on my list for awhile because I heart Michael Mina restaurants and I was pleasantly surprised to see that he had one in Scottsdale. 

The restaurant is located at the Fairmont Princess but has its own entrance just beside the hotel lobby. There is no self-parking, but you can get your valet slip validated by the hostess at the restaurant so that there is no charge for using the Fairmont's valet. You're greeted by walls of wine bottles along the hallway as you enter. The decor is sleek, modern, and sophisticated with lighting that is low enough to be romantic but bright enough that you can see your companions and the food. The dining rooms are very segmented/partitioned, which creates lots of little cubbies perfect for an intimate dinner (instead of a large sea of tables in a cavernous dining room). We sat indoors but could see out to a few small patio areas which looked lovely as well. 

Although they offered a split of my favorite champagne (Billecart), I opted for a specialty cocktail instead. After reviewing the list for a few minutes, I settled on a few options and asked for our server's expert opinion, as she informed us that she had bartended in the past and was very familiar with the list. She recommended the Gypsy, which was a mix of elderflower liqueur, Mezcal, and lime served up in a martini glass and it was delicious! Crisp and refreshing. 

We deliberated over the menus for a bit, then placed our orders. We were surprised by a gift from the Chef (which seems to be automatic for everyone) of three small cups of french fries fried in duck fat along with a few different sauces. They were delicious, but a bit overwhelming as an amuse to a meal which promised to be quite heavy already :) 

Our appetizers were Butternut Squash soup and Crispy Pork Belly. Both were tasty, although the Butternut Squash Soup was definitely the more memorable as it had a bit of habenero in it which gave the flavor a nice kick!

We both ordered NY Strip as our entree and they appeared cooked to a perfect medium and mouthwateringly delicious - prepared with just a touch of salt and butter that complemented the flavor of the grass fed beef perfectly. The side dishes were fun: Hashbrown potatoes topped with cheese, bacon, with chive creme freche on the side AND brussels sprouts with bacon marmalade. The brussels sprouts were absolutely memorable - they did not look like much when they came out (in fact I grimaced a bit because I thought that they were overcooked) BUT they were amazingly delicious and addictive... definitely a highlight. 

We waited for the dessert menu with baited breath and perused it thoroughly before making our decisions. The only hiccup in the process was a misunderstanding on my part, when my sugar-deprived \"diet brain\" hopefully mistook the last line on the menu with overwhelming excitement:

\"ALL DESSERTS  - $9\" 

as some sort of amazing value-tasting of every dessert on the list. Alas, my conscious mind was able to knock some sense back into me and we settled on just two of the desserts: the Beignets and the Bourbon Bar. 

Point of note: The beignets say \"choice of one\" dipping sauce, but our server kindly reminded us that we could have all three if we wanted (and we DID!) They come with Creme Brulee (a dessert unto itself and amazingly delicious, with a perfectly toasted brulee top), Valhrona 66% dark chocolate, and Macallan Butterscotch... dunking the fluffy pastry pillow beignets into each of these was a joy - they were great!

The Bourbon Bar is deceptively small in size, but very rich! There was a brownie bottom, peanut butter ganache layer, and chocolate mousse layer covered with glacage. We cleared out every bite.

Service throughout our dinner was incredible - attentive, appropriate, gracious, but with personality. Our server was obviously knowledgeable about the menu, but even more impressive was the knowledge and enthusiasm that the back servers and food runners displayed when dropping our food - each dish was announced and explained when placed in front of us, and the staff members happily pointed out their favorites before departing the table. Our places were marked appropriately prior to each course, silverware was cleared and provided according to what we were each having. Refills for my water and my husband's iced tea were prompt and unobtrusive. The dining room captain stopped by during the meal to ascertain that we were happy with everything, and several staff members stopped on our way out to thank us for coming in and wish us a good night.

I was impressed and truly enjoyed my experience. Can't wa"}

{"text":"We had the most wonderful experience last weekend at Bourbon Steak Scottsdale.  The craft cocktails were perfect, everything we ate was exquisite; perhaps the most difficult part was pairing it down to an acceptable amount for our party of 4.  We decided to go family-style and order the tomahawk with a bunch of appetizers and sides.  Dessert is not to be skipped, the beignets and Bourbon Bar are highly addictive, the vanilla bean cheesecake was heavenly and the Meyer Lemon Meringue was an absolute masterpiece; not something I would ordinarily order but it was truly spectacular.  Kudos also to Trevor (and all the other staff who came by to drop a plate of deliciousness) who provided the perfect, warm and unobtrusive service."}
{"text":"We ate here a few weeks ago.  Everything was great.  Service was attentive, but never intrusive.  Our server was very knowledgeable and guided us through the menu with excellent recommendations.  We enjoyed grilled octopus, chilled corn soup, foie gras, ny strip, filet, traditional mashed potatoes, and sautéed spinach.  The chef sent out a few small amuses that were also very nice including a trio of duck fat French fries and a tuna tataki.  Enjoyed some nice cocktails as well as some champagne."}
{"text":"Michael Mina never disappoints. Was thrilled to stumble across an MM restaurant in N. Scottsdale, located at the Fairmont. 

Specialty cocktails are delish and well-made. Ahi tuna tartare is outstanding - high quality tuna prepared with ancho chile, pear and sesame oil. HH specials are great. Kumamoto oysters were fresh and beautifully presented ($2 e during HH). Short rib sliders (2 sliders/order) are well-constructed - the short rib was flavorful and tender.

Excellent service. Beautiful wine list. Fantastic ambiance and decor."}
{"text":"I love Michael Mina restaurants and always have a great experience. We ordered Wagyu, filet and lobster pot pie. The lobster pot pie presentation and serving was amazing. My husband's Wagyu was good but not the best he has had and the filet was tasty. The trio of fries cooked in duck fat were good. Since we are from Ca, we ordered the foie gras. It was good but definitely an acquired taste. Overall everything was delicious and will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I chose to kick off the first ever Phoenix Restaurant Week at Bourbon Steak in the beautiful Fairmont Scottsdale Princess.  While the ambiance of the restaurant is somewhat fun, the food and service do not have me running back.

The restaurant itself is done in a very modern white theme and its very large.  There are several dining rooms (some that are more tucked away than others as well as a large dining room), a bar/lounge area, and a rather inviting looking patio.  I remarked on the way in that it would make the perfect place for a group dinner- its fun, lively, and can easily accommodate a large party.  (If you are looking for a romantic evening, this probably isn't your spot).  The selection of music is questionable, as we heard a range that went from Jack Johnson to Snow Patrol to the Eagles to 80s.  

The service left much to be desired.  We waited entirely too long to place our orders, so much so that the duck fat fries and foccacia had already been brought to the table by the time we did.  (We also waited for water for entirely too long...water should be put on the table moments after we are seated).  Once we had placed our drink orders our two glasses of wine took a bit to get to us.  Our table wasn't properly set (a huge pet peeve of mine in restaurants) and we had to ask our server for plates to enjoy the foccacia and fries.  Throughout the night the service was spotty at best.

The duck fat fries were very crunchy, yet very good, according to my husband.  (Being allergic to duck I was not able to enjoy them, but I much appreciated the fact that it was announced they were cooked in duck fat when brought to the table.  But then again most upscale restaurants announce the dish and method of preparation when delivering it).  The foccacia was great.  I selected the heirloom tomato appetizer with Burrata cheese which was lovely, and my husband enjoyed his soup (which he found to be sweet) and his mini grilled cheese.  We were both disappointed with our entrees however.  My husband selected the skirt steak which was fatty and very tough to eat.  I know that is the nature of the cut, however, I have had skirt steak that has literally melted in my mouth.  My prime beef short rib was good, but alas, prime rib is prime rib and when I eat it I always feel as if I'm at a wedding.  We had also ordered a side of their truffled mac and cheese which was perhaps the most disappointing part of the meal.  When I order gourmet mac and cheese I'm doing it because I want to indulge...there was nothing indulgent or decadent about this mac and cheese.  It was practically flavorless actually. Of all the mac and cheese side dishes I have ordered in my life (and trust me, there has been a lot), this was my least favorite.  In fact, we didn't even finish it.  Dessert was delicious, even if my beignets were more like zeppole.  My husband loved the vanilla pot du creme which was caramelized perfectly on top.  His trio of ice creams was unremarkable.

The regular menu is a la carte style and was actually more reasonably priced than I had expected.  Although Yelp has it listed as a \"dressy\" restaurant there were people in jeans there.  (I don't think there are actual \"dressy\" restaurants in Phoenix....)   

Now, yes, this is Restaurant Week and I do understand that sometimes restaurants can be overwhelmed with people.  Bourbon Steak was not full by any means (we were the only people seated in our section for quite some time) and I can't imagine our server had more than 2 other tables.  I also understand that the menu options are being produced en masse.  However, in selecting the menu one would expect a restaurant to choose dishes that they know that they can make en masse and make them well.  Restaurant Week is supposed to entice the customer to come back for more, but I have to say that I don't think the quality of food warrants a second visit anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I'm confused as to why this is only a 3.5 star restaurant. We went tonight to celebrate our anniversary and I can't think of one negative thing. We had a 7pm reservation on a Friday night and when we arrived we were immediately escorted to our table. The hostesses were friendly and congratulated us on our anniversary. We were given a card signed by all of the staff as well as complimentary champagne. 

Instead of bread you get a trio of different seasoned French fries and dipping sauces which were all excellent. For dinner we each had a filet, we split Brussels sprouts, truffle macaroni and cheese, and prawns. The filets were tender and juicy and cooked perfectly as ordered. The sides were delicious and very flavorful. For dessert we had beignets with a dark chocolate dipping sauce as well as a trio of uniquely flavored sorbets. The desserts were absolutely incredible. For drinks we had an old fashion and a glass of Malbec and both were high quality and smooth. 

On top of the food the service was impeccable. Everyone was so kind and helpful throughout the entire meal. The atmosphere was modern and inviting. We sat on the patio and it was a beautiful setting with tranquil accent lighting and greenery. 

We will absolutely be back and would have no qualms recommending this place as a 5 star steak house"}
{"text":"Fabulous meal. We had a 5 course pre set dinner. The salmon was one of the best I have ever had. The filet was incredible with the perfect amount of spices. Definitely worth the experience. The staff was also extremely attentive to our group"}
{"text":"I will start off on  the good stuff. We received a card celebrating our Anniversary.  It pretty much went down hill from there.  The waiter was nice, but ALLL his recommendations were really bad. My wife asked him about the Lobster Pot Pie ($65). He said it was great a must have. However it was anything but. on a scale from 1 to 10 it was a 1.  The salad he recommended was a 1 out of 10. It had no dressing on it. Th waiter said nothing to us when we told him that. My steak was very good, however at $85.00 what would you expect.   

Over all we would not go back, for a $292 bill, we were very very disappointed.  Don't go here. Save your money."}
{"text":"I had a really nice dinner everything was wonderful I was pretty obsessed with the gnocchi and caviar appetizer.  Sitting outside was definitely a plus but the inside would've been fine. Service was on point,  of course. There's nothing to complain here.  The oysters were extremely fresh. The American wagyu steak was to die for but even the cheaper filet mignon was just as good."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I were attending a conference at the hotel and decided to try the steakhouse rather than the buffet provided to us. I was really looking forward to a great experience, however after spending $240 for my bill alone-yes just mine, the six of us racked up $800 plus, I was left very disappointed. My $59 bone-in rib eye steak was cooked improperly, over done, and as soon as my knife hit it I knew it was not tender as a marbled steak is supposed to be. I ordered medium rare and received a tasteless, poorly seasoned medium plus. After already sending my wine back for something more palatable I chose not to hold up the other diners and eat the steak. I also shared a $75 lobster pot pie that boasted 2 lbs. of lobster in the menu description. NOT! Ask for a scale if you order this! There was one small tail and two claws under the large, mostly empty and also tasteless pastry dough. This was the most expensive meal I have ever eaten, and the most disappointing. Save your money and go someplace else!"}
{"text":"I took my wife on a date here this past weekend and loved it.  The food was amazing, and well worth the money. Our server, Todd, was great.  This was great choice for a night out."}
{"text":"I am a foodie, recently relocated from San Francisco.  My standards for dining and food are high.  My husband and I have dined often at Bourbon Steak - while here on vacation and now that we live here.  The food is consistently excellent - for steak - it is by far the best in town.  The service is also excellent - we always ask for Jeremy as our server.   He is professional and personable.  Everything is timed to perfection when working with him.  We recommend this place often and suggest our friends request Jeremy as their server."}
{"text":"I recently visited the Bourbon Steak at the wonderful Fairmont resort in Scottsdale, and I was anything but pleased.  Our waiter was very nice and attentive; props to him.  The food on the other hand was very mediocre for the price.  My family's dishes were all over salted almost to the point of being inedible, and my pork chop was pure fat.  I was hoping for better and  wanted to have great food, but I came back with a very disappointed result.  All I ended up getting was a pricey check and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Service was very attentive and mindful. 
Water was always full, servers and bus staff were very attentive.
menu- really over priced 
Sides- were great choices

Overall, the atmosphere is a 4
Staff is a 4
Menu and Value -kind of a 2.5 
Its a little underwhelming in that sense but I realize this is very high end but I have had much better elsewhere for the value."}
{"text":"Cocktails, sides were amazing - steak was a bit salty.  I was so impressed with Bourbon Steak - the decor, the cocktails, the service was top notch. I thought the green goddess salad was delicious too!!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with other reviewers on this restaurant.  We went their for happy hour since we were staying at the hotel and we didn't want to go out again.  We sat at the bar and decided to try a few happy hour menu items and also a couple of items from the regular menu.  The positives - our bartender was very knowledgeable about the food and provided great service.  The wine list is also extensive.  The food is just ok and given the value, it is less than okay.  The not so positives - We started with deep fried macaroni & cheese - it was good but not memorable.  The duck fat french fries (3 different kinds with three different sauces) were very good.  They were crispy and the sauces were flavorful.  The pulled pork sliders with some cream corn pudding sauce.  The sliders had very little taste, buns were dry and the sauce was not edible.  The philly cheesesteak springroll with carmelized onions and spicy ketchup was very good.  Small appetizers for $5 each.  We tried the tuna tartare $19 - tuna was fresh, habanero infused sesame oil was overpowering in sesame flavor.  it also came with diced pears, hot peppers and pine nuts - again, sesame oil overpowerered everything.  Happy hour wines $5 were okay.  The bourbon malt adult milkshake was very good.

Overall, overpriced for the taste of the food.  I don't mind paying good money if it is good - I definitely wouldn't return to this place.  It wasn't awful, just not worth wasting a meal there.  This was my first time at a Michael Mina restaurant and it was disappointing."}
{"text":"Convinced by the excellent reviews, Hubby and I went to Bourbon Steak's Sunday Night BBQ last night and had a very good time overall.

Pros: nice, comfortable, casual room; varied appetizer buffet- we especially liked the Kobe sliders and the salads; the \"complimentary\" duck fat fries; the skirt steak and salmon entrees were both outstanding and perfectly cooked; delicious sides- grilled corn smothered in a zesty sauce, grilled asparagus, baked beans; dessert overkill with apple crisp, root beer floats, and chocolate slivers and pecan cookies; mostly great service (they brought me the wrong entree at first).

Cons: obnoxiously loud DJ music- we could not hear each other across the small table until they lowered the shade \"wall\" directly behind us; neither of us cared for the soups; for me, the gin selection was a little limited.

It was spendy- with 2 drinks, bottled water, and tip it was over $160, but we left very satisfied. In fact, I was so full, I couldn't eat my cookie. But it smelled so good, I wanted to try it later. I asked for a piece of foil so I could wrap it up and put it in my purse. What did they bring me? The single cookie in a huge entree sized tupperware-style container and in a large Bourbon Steak bag. When I laughed, the server explained, \"Well, we have to make it look good.\" 

We'll be back to try the regular menu soon."}
{"text":"I went for an event here Thursday night. I didn't try a full dinner but got to try a sampling of items - seared steak skewers, steak tartare, duck fat fries, truffled mac and cheese. The truffled mac and cheese won hands down, fantastic. I've heard the prices here are steep so can't vouch for how I'd feel if I came for a full dinner and paid for it, but my first impression was good. More importantly the setting was fabulous. The patio is really great - now that the weather's cooling down at night this is a great place to eat outside and linger over cocktails! Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Difficult to review a place when you're part of a large, private party.  For obvious reasons, the food prep is different, the service is different (not necessarily better or worse), the ambience is almost always different than the main dining room (not necessarily better or worse), and often, the menu is pre-set, as it was last night.

Having said all that, we had a wonderful experience at Bourbon Steak last night.  We were seated at a very large, long table, so you could only converse with the person sitting to your right or left and across from you.  The room was more of a \"space\" which was open to and adjacent to the main dining room.

As it seems to be the trend, Bourbon Steak is designed to be very loud.  Quite literally, its walls are made of bare concrete.  The floor is concrete.  For me, the space is simply too loud, with noise even spilling over from the crowded bar into the main dining area.  The noise aside, the atmosphere is very cool, with dark tones and tasteful decor.

The pre-set menu included choice of salad or mushroom soup.  I opted for the soup. I was served a bowl of fresh mushrooms and then the server poured a delicious broth over the top.  I also opted for the filet mignon over the vegetarian option and the salmon option.

The steak was very good, but not over-the-top or memorable or superior to any of the great many great steakhouses around Scottsdale. The sides included duck fat fries and crisped broccoli, both very good.

I wasn't thrilled with the pre-selected dessert, a sort of dark chocolate covered peanut butter \"log\".  I'm certain there are other delicious desserts served here--I'm just not a peanut fan.

Overall great place, especially if you're at the Fairmont already.  Lots of strong steak and seafood competition nearby, however."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for a nice, classic dirty martini last night and R.J. (bartender) filled the void perfectly. Served with a skewer of small,  delicious Kalamata olives. This was a pleasant twist to the big, green olives. The martini was clean, smooth and perfectly balanced. Thumbs up R.J.! 

On the other hand, the Vegetarian Falafel burger that I ordered was thumbs...sideways. I've had falafel burgers and traditional fried falafel countless times before so I was stoked to see it on their menu. My experience was a disappointment in flavor and texture. The burger was completely bland and could have used a little extra texture. The burger is touted as Michael Mina's mother's recipe. So I really hate to give it a negative review. Perhaps Chef Mina should step Mom's recipe up a notch! #Just saying. 

When my server asked how my food was, I let him know that I wasn't a fan. His response was,  \"Ok, I'll let the chef know\" and sheepishly walked away. Huh!??? That's it? Our server was very pleasant and attentive, but when it came to responding to \"I don't care for my meal\" he could have done better. And frankly, if I wasn't with business associates, I would have sent the burger back. I felt that instead of simply saying \"I'll let the Chef know\" he should have asked if he could bring me something else. I accidentally skipped lunch and starving, so I ate the burger...reluctantly. 

I've been to Bourbon a few times but always just sit in the bar which I think has great ambiance. The last time I was there, me and my friend ordered classic cheeseburgers. We asked for them to be cooked medium. We got medium-well. The beef is high quality, so the taste was good and we didn't complain. But still, we ASKED for medium. The red onion rings were delish however. 

Question is: can I get a consistent meal at Bourbon Steak? Jury is still out."}
{"text":"Exceptional. One of the best places I've ever eaten. The lobster pot pie is so unique and the flavor profile is out of this world. Steak, brussels sprouts, truffle mac & cheese, shaking beef appetizer... Plus fantastic, warm service... I really appreciated it. Thanks to Michael and Andrew!"}
{"text":"I came to enjoy some dessert with family before the NYE party and I have to say for the amount you receive and the price it costs, it wasn't worth it. 

The presentation and service was excellent, and the restaurant is very beautiful but the desserts were not mind blowing. We ordered the Bourbon Bar which is a chocolate covered peanut butter and bourbon bar. We also ordered the Baked Alaska as well which was a strawberry champagne sorbet with meringue."}
{"text":"This place is a JOKE!!!  If I were Michael Mina, I would pack my bags and go home quietly.  Then again, he's the one laughing all the way to the bank while serving up french fries and corn dogs.  Sacre bleu!!!

This place is great for assisting the Snottsdale crowd and other unsophisticated palates at overextending their revolving credit a bit further but if you want good food then go elsewhere.  More expensive doesn't always mean better quality.  Sometimes it means you're just getting screwed without the benefit of Astroglide.

Artificially elegant setting with a provincial crowd and maybe fine for a HALF bottle of champagne but I say forget it altogether.  Zinc Bistro is more fun for people watching while sipping your bottle of Krug and chompin' on yer mac n cheese hoss.  Want a good meal?  Go to Houston's."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service are outstanding-food is delicious. But everything is à la cart so be prepared. The baked potato is not worth $16 so don't even bother. The wild mushrooms were nice and the file-but fillet was cooked more than it should've been. Requested medium rare and it came out Medium-but was still good. The shaken beef was nice and tender and tasty-the rack of lamb was well worth it and the best item on the table. Delicious and cooked to perfection at medium rare. For more food he chat follow me on Facebook @FoodieGuido"}
{"text":"This place is really good. Every year we come here for a business trip and I have to come here at least one night. It's located in the Fairmont Princess where our event is held.

Ambiance is very nice. Long dark hallway to the hostess. Make sure to make a reservation otherwise you'll end up eating at the bar somewhere which is okay but it can get full so you may not have a place to eat. If you come here you MUST order the SHRIMP. It's the largest shrimp I've ever had and they give you 2 of them. WOW!!! They also presented us with complimentary french fries with 3 different kind of dipping sauces (truffle, onion ketchup, and a bbq something). The truffle is outstanding. 

So, I've ordered the filet mignon which is cooked to perfection (however you prefer). I've also had the short ribs which was tender and soft so it was easy to cut. I would definitely go back and order either. I'm sure everything here is excellent. I did also have a bite of my colleague's foie gras which melted like butter in my mouth.

The waiter also refilled our glasses of water before even asking."}
{"text":"The title of this review will be: \"should I wear a helmet to dinner?\" Doesn't that make you want to read more... My fiancé's mother made a reservation here. We have been to a Michael Mina restaurant before in Vegas at the Bellagio. We always like to dine at celebrity/chef's restaurants so we are excited about this experience. We had a plan to walk around the Princess Hotel in Scottsdale after, as it was a few days after Christmas and they have a beautiful Christmas village set up all around the hotel. This was our second time to the Fairmont Princess and our first time to Bourbon Steak restaurant. We had gotten there a few minutes before they opened. They told us to wait in the lobby until they were ready to let us in. My fiancé and I walked around a little bit and noticed that there was a little wine tunnel that was pretty cool. The restaurant reminded us of the certain Decour that Las Vegas dining usually has. They brought us to our seats which was lovely. It was right in the back so we had a great view of the outside area, but it was too cold for us to sit outside. Although others were sitting outside underneath heat lamps. We were greeted by our server whose name is Logan. He was lovely. He knew so much about bourbon. My fiancé and his father know a lot about bourbon so it was nice to hear them talk about the different Bourbons that they enjoy. I learned a lot from Logan as he really knows a lot about not only the taste but also the distribution and barreling process behind each bourbon. He was patient enough to bring a few bottles over from the bar so we could see what they looked like. We started out with duck fat fries instead of bread. They said the bread could be requested if needed. The fries were pretty good, but I try to stay away from the fried stuff because it hurts my stomach. I got a vodka martini which was delicious while the boys ordered bourbon. We split a wedge salad which was big enough for four people to share, if you're not starving. I ordered the king Salmon and that was delicious as well. The ambience was cool, our service was phenomenal, and the food was pretty good. There were a few dishes that  came out compliments of the chef. One was this delicious mozzarella ball, and they gave us gingersnap cookies at the end although we did not order dessert. Now getting back to the dramatic stuff, I was sitting there finishing my dinner when one of the other servers walked by me and dropped a heavy menu right on my head. It ricocheted off of my head and hit my fiancé's shoulder. He said it really hurt his shoulder so he could only imagine how badly it hurt my head. I was very surprised and shocked when it happened, and my fiancé sort of had to replay it for me. It wasn't really the fact that that menu dropped, although he could have been more careful, accidents happen. It was the way that he handled the situation. He said sorry in an obligatory way, and then went on his merry way. I had to say something to management in case I ended up with a concussion or something worse later on that night. They were nice enough to remove my fiancé and my own meal from the check. First they said they would only offer us dessert, in which we said we would like to see the meals removed as well. However, I really didn't feel like enough. They also had that particular server come over and apologize to me. Again, it seemed forced. Overall, the next day we went out to dinner at a different place and I felt a little PTSD as far as getting menus dropped on my head. I'm only half kidding. This was a very interesting ending to it could've been a pretty good dinner. For how highly priced everything else, I would say maybe stop by for a drink and an appetizer, but don't plan to spend the night there."}
{"text":"This meal was a disappointment for my husband and me. The service was not great. There were a few larger parties and we were left hanging a few times. It seemed like we were a bother. 

The beet salad was yummy and hubby's filet had good flavor but lacked in the presentation. I liked the flavor more than he did. It looked blah. 
We asked which side was a good one and went with the hash browns. What a waste! They were straight out of a freezer with a little topping. Not what we expected. 
The prawns were good. 
Great wine selection with some very affordable options. 

Not sure we would go again...
I would rather get a cab and go to nearby Capital Grille."}
{"text":"Hmmm, where do I begin.  Went there on a Thursday night during FBR and was not impressed.  The lighting was SUPER BRIGHT...could've been a little more dim in the dining area.  We had the Foie Gras Sliders...which are not really your typical sliders...OK!  Another appi we had was the Ahi Tuna Tartare...another no no :-)  So I thought, OK, I'll order the \"wedge\" salad..and that was much to my amazement at PAR (no pun intended).  I had the 8oz filet as my main entree and although good, not sure it garnered the price tag to go with it...yes $72 for an 8oz filet...can you believe it.  We had the asparagus (my favorite vegi) and it was OK.  I think my entire favorite part of the whole experience was the company I was with.  Drinks followed at the outside bar...great bar area out there!!!!  Would go back just for that!!  And I think I'll stick to Flemings for my steaks :-)   Fred F...how did you have a 10oz filet for $48???  Why do restaurants feel they can change a price tag just because of FBR???  That's annoying!!!  And NO the free fries did not make up for the delays we had!!"}
{"text":"Writing this a little late, but we came here during Restaurant Week. We were seated in a small dining area, which felt closed off from the rest of the restaurant. I wasn't a fan of the lighting. I felt like I was in a fitting room. 

Anyway the service here was great. Our waiter explained both the Restaurant Week menu and their regular menu. They immediately brought us the duck fat fries and 3 dipping sauces. I love them all. The french fries were great. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. This is a great starter. 

We tried the cauliflower veloute and the beef carpaccio for our appetizers. The carpaccio was ok. It did have too many unnecessary ingredients. The cauliflower veloute however was divine. It was so smooth and creamy. It included a lobster fritter and pieces of apple. I could have had a bucket of this for dinner and have been in heaven. We also received some focaccia bread with out appetizers. It was so warm and buttery. We hadn't even had our actual dinner yet and we were getting full. They certainly give your your monies worth. 

We both ordered the flat iron and short rib for our entrees. We got a little bit of each, which was just enough since we had quite a few other things to eat on the table. The flat iron steak was juicy and flavorful. The short rib was tender but just not as appealing as the steak. 

Lastly we shared the mascarpone cheesecake and the beignets with the butterscotch creme. Both were delicious. The beignets came with more than enough creme so we took a bit and layered it on top of the cheesecake. Yum. 

Nice place for dinner. I love coming to the Princess to lounge and have after dinner drinks. The open air bar with their huge lounge area is a great place to come on a nice night and enjoy our beautiful weather."}
{"text":"We took advantage of the TravelZoo deal after having an AMAZING experience at Michael Mina in San Francisco.  This was not even in the same realm.

We purchased the 5 course tasting menu and had made reservations weeks in advance for our anniversary.  I confirmed prior to purchase that they could accomodate food allergies (as Michael Mina had done) - they said yes so I purchased the TravelZoo 5 course tasting menu for 2.

We arrived at 5:30 PM and were the 3rd party seated in the restaurant.  Drinks, amuse bouche, and two rounds of complimentary bar snacks followed in quick succession.  Each time something was delivered the server noted it had accommodated my allergy.  By the time the first course arrived we had been there for 30 minutes and we well attended to.  

After 6 PM the experience fell apart.  Other diners were seated and the only staff member we saw consistently was the busser who provided water.  The Manager was circulating and actively visiting other tables but never came to ours.  We waited from 10 to 20 minutes between arrival of each the remaining courses.  Our waiter no longer explicitly stated that the dish complied with my allergies, but I figured I was ok since he was well aware.  For the palate cleanser and the 5th course - which did say Happy Anniversary - we had another server.  This new server brought me something that clearly contained ingredients I was allergic to.  So instead of a beautiful dessert, ten minutes later I received more palate cleanser!  The next day I experienced signs I had been exposed to allergens, possibly from courses 2, 3 or 4.

This was a subpar experience. Poorly paced, ok food and mediocre service after the first 30 minutes. This was not a $354 experience. Even with the TravelZoo discount it was not a $217 experience. And we were there over 2 hours and 15 minutes!

Grossly disappointed.

Wine a delicious $20 a glass Pinot Noir
Amuse Bouche - Ahi tartare (me), Ahi Poke (guest) - best thing all night
Bar Snacks #1 - Truffled Popcorn (me), Trio of Duckfat fries (guest) - ok not mind blowing
Bar Snacks #2 - Beef Butter with radish (me), Mushroom Arancini (guest) - meh
Course #1 - Corn Soup - tart, delicious 2nd best thing all night
Course #2 - Crab Risotto - creamy, garlic, chewy rice, a few lumps of crab - 3rd best item
Course #3 - Crispy Skin Salmon on Onion puree  - nothing special
Course #4 - Chimichurri Steak, crispy broccoli - nothing special
Palate Cleanser - raspberry lime sorbet
Course #5 -   Sorbet trio (me), Bourbon Bar - chocolate brownie, ganache, peanut powder, chocolate covered pretzels (guest)

The manager seemed to visit every table but ours - I can only assume it was because we were using a TravelZoo deal.  We had not used a coupon/deal at Michael Mina in San Francisco and it was awesome.  Don't sell a TravelZoo deal if you are not going to treat your guests well!"}
{"text":"A fabulous design - from light fixtures to table and stemware details. The service was attentive, maybe too much. There was someone at our table every 3 seconds refilling a water glass. A bit annoying when trying to have a conversation.
Was my steak worth $60-no way. I don't mind paying for great food, but it wasn't that wow. The side dishes were ok, nothing to rave about.
The highlight for me is that they serve Lamille coffee.
But I think I won't revisit this one."}
{"text":"I was taken here by my family for my birthday and was treated like royalty by the staff. Great selection, great food. Wr had a very enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"Since this is the wine + steakhouse concept at the Fairmont Princess in Scottsdale, we expected a five star experience. This is that classic example of how a restaurant can have a perfect menu, great wine list, pleasing environment...but if the service/staff is unenthusiastic...it sort of falls off in a hurry. 

Now, in full disclosure...my dining partner on this eve is not the most user friendly guy - he'll tell staff how and when he wants to them to clear plates and that he does not care which app goes to whom and then changes his mind when he sees the app and then tells the server to change the plates - but a 'great' restaurant has staff that knows there are 'strong' personalities out there, and is able to roll with it. That is the reality of the hospitality business (despite my CORE belief that you should ALWAYS be nice to people at all times, but that is another topic entirely). 

The food...was fabulous. Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna, Hanger Steak, grilled shishito peppers, tuna tartar, fois grois...each was done to five-star standards. 

My wine was a great selection for a by the glass pour...a Hearst Paso Robles cab in a good year. Much appreciated!

Just wish the staff were more in sync with pleasing people with the greater picture in mind...I got an overall vibe that guests were to be tolerated."}
{"text":"As stated in previous reviews, I've been a Michael Mina fan since the beginning in SF.  Bourbon Steak is one of his newer establishments, bankrolled by Agassi, and specializes in more American style dishes than his signature \"trio\" style of preparation.  

We had fois gras sliders, Mina's signature tuna tare tar, and plenty of steak (poached in butter, then grilled to perfection).  Sides were truffled mac and cheese, asparagus and white cheddar potatoes.  All very good, but not outstanding.  

What was outstanding was the 18yr old Macallan butterscotch sauce for the beignets.  No joke... serve that stuff on a woman.  Forget the beignets... just give me that butterscotch and some privacy with a lady.  That alone is 6 stars.  All you haters out there are just upset you didn't think of that first.  And yes... my \"to go\" bag had plenty of butterscotch."}
{"text":"Lets start with service. First class and very knowledgeable of the dinner and cocktail menus. Food was first class and well worth the money. I had the Saratoga Steak andbit was tender and full of flavor. The creamed spinach was fantastic. Great experience.!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! No Yelp review could possibly do this restaurant any justice. It is impossible to articulate such a remarkable experience with just words, but I was enamored, so I must try.    

My husband and I recently celebrated our 5th wedding anniversary and he wooed me with the phenomenal culinary experience that is Bourbon Steak. The atmosphere was modern and upbeat. The food was captivating; I was truly seduced by each bite. And my gosh - I didn't know it was possible to fantasize about Duck Fat Fries! The food is unparalleled. Lastly, the impeccable service must not go unnoticed. Special thanks to the staff and our server, Todd, who made our anniversary and dining experience unforgettable."}
{"text":"What do you expect? it's Michael Mina...This place is a fortune, but well worth it. It's not someplace you'd come to on a regular basis, I'd say it's more of an 'occasion' restaurant. The dishes are pretty much culinary masterpieces and the service is top notch. Even the 'bread' they put on the table is this rosemary baked potato truffle concoction. I can't tell you how disgusting you will feel after eating at this place, you will be so full! I could not believe that I was eating the most spectacular french fries (they give you a trio of flavors\"...the secret ingredient? duckfat. uchhhhhhhhh. but sooo good. Definitely a heavy meal...be in the mood to chow on fine food. You will not want to eat the next day!"}
{"text":"I really was disappointed with the atmosphere. The music and song selection was low volume and horrible. They have a lot of windows which makes it really hot and they don't turn the AC down. I got a filet and it was really salty and unappetizing. The price was extremely high and for the price it's so not worth it."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for four people on Saturday night.  
First, they sat us 30 minutes past our reservation time. 
Second, the wedge salad was not good.
Third, all of our steaks were flat out cold.  I ordered a filet medium well and it came out rare. When they brought them back, two of the steaks were still not cooked right and cold.  Some of the side dishes were cold too.  The table behind us also had to send back their food as well.  I've eaten at the Bourbon Steak in Washington, DC several times and it is outstanding.  Stay away from this one."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! My fiancé and I had one of our best dinner EVER. We love Michael Mina and ate in his restaurants in Vegas...but this place is just the best!!! The food was perfect and cooked to perfection and the service was outstanding!!!! Thank you Carrie you made our night so SPECIAL!!! We loved the oysters, foie gras, the duck fat fries, the ahi tuna tartar...the snapper was exquisite and the NY steak to die for...we also had the butternut squash soup...the best!!! Also an amazing wine selection...we thought Carrie would have to roll us out of the restaurant...haha...almost...we will be back for sure!!! And the beignets...Were DELICIOUS!!!!Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"The decor, service and food were all very nice. We had the filet mignon, horseradish potatoes, salad, key lime pie and the beignets/crime brûlée dessert. The desserts were excellent, as was the filet mignon. We enjoyed the salad and potatoes but it wasn't something we would crave. It's definitely the way to go if you're going to come for their Christmas event, as you get free parking and entrance."}
{"text":"Instead of bread they give you a trio of French fries, cooked in duck fat and served with three dipping sauces to start. They are out of this world. What a great start to an incredible meal. Next we had the Ahi tuna tartare. It was good, but not great.  Honestly, I was a little worried after the Ahi tuna tartare that the food was a bit overrated.  Then came the perfectly cooked (and thoughtfully sliced - yes, they asked if we wanted it sliced!) 32oz Porterhouse.  We also ordered the delectable white cheddar hashbrowns with bacon and scallions and the smoked onion creamed spinach.  OMG!  Delicious!  We couldn't finish our food and it was just as delicious when we finished the leftovers the next day for lunch.  Yum-O!"}
{"text":"First and foremost this is a steak place. If you love a good steak the reviews from the rest of my party were very good. I don't have steak all that often, and opted for the scallops and risotto here. Being from New England I know good scallops, and this place certainly has great scallops. They were thick juicy and very tasteful. You will spend at least $30 per entrée, and then another 15 for your salad if you choose. Tack on a couple of drinks and an appetizer and it's pricey night. That being said, the food was delicious, everyone was very satisfied with your meal, the service was excellent, and we had a very enjoyable night. The complimentary fries with the dipping sauces was also a great touch. If you are here you are probably on vacation so live it up have a good meal and enjoy."}
{"text":"Long stem clovers for a salad? Tasteless dressing? Noisier than Costco? Wine by the glass price is insulting! This place just didnt click.......If it wasn't for the great service, I'd give it a 1."}
{"text":"I dined at Bourbon Steak yesterday evening for their Thanksgiving dinner with my family. Three of us ordered bone in ribeye steaks. They were cooked perfectly. My wife ordered the turkey cutlet which was a huge disappointment. It looked and tasted like it was a frozen cutlet. One would think that the chef would offer fresh turkey on Thanksgiving. Most of the sides were very good accept for the dry stuffing and odd cranberry sauce. Our bill with the gratuity came in at $500! I don't mind spending that much for an excellent meal but my wife could have had a better fresh turkey meal at another restaurant at a much lower price. 

One month after the first review. No response from management. After spending over $500 one would think that a response would be appropriate. By my wife not enjoying her meal it ruined it for all of us. I guess they just don't care. We will not be returning to Bourbon Steak. 

These people stand behind their food and service and took care of the issue I had. This is a steakhouse and they make excellent steaks. The problem we had was with a turkey cutlet. Stick with the steaks and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I really like trying a different high-end steakhouse every so often, and when I found out that Bourbon Steak poaches some of their cuts in butter before cooking, I had to try it. Based on recommendations from several different staff, I ended up ordering the Skirt Steak (which I never thought I would have done at a steakhouse like this), and was pleasantly surprised! With one slice, the knife cut right through the steak, it was well-seasoned and cooked to perfection. We also ordered the mushrooms and macaroni and cheese gratin, and both of those were almost as fantastic as the steak.

The drinks at the bar were excellent, and Krystal, our bartender, was friendly and inviting to not only us, but all guests that were in the bar.

I'm really looking forward to going back and trying a different cut!"}
{"text":"They like to hide that Happy Hour Menu at the bar so \"ASK FOR IT\". I had a little chuckle while they \"pretended and tried\" to look for it. They should be proud of that menu because it is pretty awesome. I enjoyed the roasted Brussel sprouts and the Cauliflower. Keep a look out for $6 Modelo and be careful to carefully select a Margarita or they will make you a 17.00 one with upgraded Tequila. I really enjoyed the Salmon Burger and Duck Fat Fries. The restaurant is awesome but they hide it in a strange way near the lobby ....Don't be shy march on to the bar and order up. Its worth it"}
{"text":"Just exquisite.. this place is amazing. The salmon was so moist and the rib was tender and perfectly seasoned. Addition the red wine (92) was paired perfectly with our meal! am definitely looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere...they did an amazing transformation of the restaurant from Marquesa.  The service was good, but the food was just ok.  I did like the fact that they give you fries with dipping sauces as the amuse bouche and the bread was fantastic, but probably really fattening.  I would go back from drinks in the bar, but not to eat."}
{"text":"Made a reservation on Open Table, which I love, and in the notes I explained it was our 12th Anniversary. 
My Husband thought of a idea of opening a bottle of wine that we purchased on our trip to Napa. It's a special occasion type bottle.  I did a search online to see if they do a corkage fee.  I came across a website called No Corkage Fees.com. 
http://nocorkagefees.com/directory/locality/Scottsdale/#.VES0QNm9LCQ
It gives the restaurants number and address so I know I was getting the right place.  I called and a very young sounded lady, answered the phone Bourbon Steak.  I told her I had a reservation and was coming in for my anniversary dinner and was wondering if I could bring in a bottle of wine. She was quiet for a minute and said that we could do so.  We were very excited that we could bring in a bottle that we had been saving for a special occasion from our Napa trip. 
I have to admit, I didn't read my fellow Yelpers reviews and I wish I would have.  After seeing the restaurant, to me, this is not a romantic Anniversary dinner type place. 
We got to the restaurant and go to what we thought was the hostess stand.  Waited for a few minutes and then we started walking around the restaurant to try to find someone who worked there.  Finally found a server and I asked if there was a Hostess. The server said yes and was looking around to locate one or the only hostess. He started to walk us back to the hostess stand and I told him he didn't need to take us back and for him to please let the hostess know that we are waiting.  A few more minutes went by and a pretty redhead lady came by and said sorry for the wait.  I told her my name and she said Happy Anniversary.  That was a nice touch.  There was a young lady that showed up behind her, which I assumed was another hostess. They both were talking very low to each other so that I could not hear then the pretty redhead started whispering to the other hostess. I thought that was a bit unnecessary and rude to be whispering to each other when someone is standing right in front of them.  Not sure what they were talking about. The 1st hostess started to take us to our table and as we were walking around I was expecting something very different. The decor is not your traditional steakhouse. The dining room is very bright. 
We were sat in a corner but there was another couple sitting next to us and they looked mad that we sat down.  The tables were super close to each other.  My husband was sitting across the table and I was closer to the other guest than I was him, it was very awkward.  We did have a Happy Anniversary card that was sitting on the table when we sat down which was nice.  Glad I picked it up quick cause it had been on fire from the tea light candle.  I took our special bottle of wine out of my purse and places it on the table.  We sat there for a good 6 minutes before a server came to greet us.  The table next to us had been there for awhile and had water and menus.  During that time we again felt very awkward with this other table being so close. We looked around the dining room to see if there were any other possibilities of moving tables to be somewhat private. Didn't see one that would have worked.  Our server came and asked us what we wanted to drink then gave us menus. We showed him our bottle and the server said I am going to have to ask a manager.  I told him I called ahead and specifically asked and was told that I could bring it in.  The table next to us still was not approached by a server and they looked mad, not sure if it was the lack of service or the fact that we were extremely close to them.  They actually got up and left.  I was actually a bit relieved that they left, it was weird uncomfortable.  I still felt weird here cause of how bright it was and I knew we would have other people sat next to us.  The 1st hostess came and started to pour us water and she said that it was AZ State Law that they can't open our bottle.  I told her I specifically called and spoke to someone who said it was ok.  She asked for the name who I spoke to, I said I didn't remember and that it was a young lady.  Then she asked if I called the right place. Yes, I called the correct restaurant they answered the phone Bourbon Steak.  I then told her about the website No Corkage Fees.com and that's how I got their number.  We both decided that we would leave.  The pretty redhead, what we thought was a hostess said that she was the assistant manager and asked what was wrong.  We told her and she asked if we would like another table, we said no. We said the evening here isn't going well and we want to enjoy our anniversary.  She did offer to make reservations somewhere else and we said no. 
My review is on poor customer service and awkward seating arrangements.  The food may be wonderful but we will never know.  I also want to say that I am fine with not being able to bring our own bottle of wine if that is a AZ State Law, just don't tell me it is ok."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour and it was very lively. You were able to talk to the people sitting around you without hollering. That was great. The sliders and fries were great. The bartenders where very knowledgeable about wine and drinks. Great place. Enjoy"}
{"text":"My wife and i wanted to celebrate her birthday 
So we decided to try bourbon steak invites a couple of friends to come 
The atmosphere was great the service lacked a bit of professionalism as we were sat in a wrong table and then we were asked to get up and go to to the right table no worries at all there everyone makes mistakes 
The duck fries were great 
Here comes the disappointing part
We ordered the oysters when the platter got to our table we all laughed out loud at the size of the oysters they were small and just disappointing
When we asked the waitress why they were so small she said they were baby oysters that information would have been helpful before we ordered them my wife got prime skirt steak that looked more like a flank steak the taste was ok if we hard some tortillas we could have made tacos out of that meat it was very disappointing 
I got the 8oz filet when it arrived it looked more like a hockey puck than a steak i asked for medium rare and it was more on the well done side (picture below)
The whole experience was not a good one at all
I don't even want to mention what our friends ordered as it was the same deal with then as it was with us"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful family dinner here this evening! Jeremy was an outstanding server and we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I went here last night with my wife to celebrate our 2 year wedding anniversary.  We purposely arrived early to have a drink at their bar.  There wasn't much of a selection on their happy hour drink menu so we just ordered our go-to drinks.  Champagne for her and a martini for me.  The hostess/waiter/waitress were very friendly and prompt.  When we were ready for dinner we were brought to the main dining area and our bar tab was transferred without trouble.

I made a reservation a few weeks prior and made a notation that it was our anniversary.  Upon arrival at our table there was a card saying happy anniversary which was a nice touch.  The table was smack in the middle of the dining room so my wife asked if we could move to another table.  The host was very accommodating and gave us a better table.

The place is pretty sheik to the eye but uncomfortable.  The 2-top tables are small, too close to other people, and I don't want to sound like a 90 year old, but the chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable.  I don't know about you but I like to eat my too expensive meal in utter comfort.  The noise level is also above where it should be but they were playing some pretty solid tunes throughout the night.

Our waitress was excellent and knowledgeable but was taking care of way too many tables which made her unable to come around as often as I would have liked.  I especially liked our sommelier who gave us an awesome wine recommendation.  Also, I'm not sure if this is all the time or not, but all bottles under $300 were 1/2 price so we splurged on a more expensive bottle than we would have normally purchased.

The Food:

* Fries - they give these to you instead of bread.  They are excellent especially the truffle ones.  My only issue is that you could tell they were sitting out for a half hour before being served to us.  I would have liked them fresh but whatever.
* Wedge Salad - just ok.  The blue cheese and bacon were great though.  It just wasn't the typical steak joint wedge I am used to and was looking forward to.
* Burrata Cheese - this was very unique to me and pretty good
* Truffled Mac n' Cheese - not the best I've ever had but still pretty good.  Not as thick and cheesy as I would have liked and they use weird noodles.
* Wagyu Beef Trio - My wife and I shared this.  Perfect amount for the both of us to share.  Each 4oz piece of steak was perfectly cooked, juicy and delicious.  I still can't tell the difference between regular beef and wagyu though.  The sides were also very good.  We especially liked the mushrooms.  The mashed potatoes were too creamy and just eh.
* Beignets - we shared these for desert and they are fluffy, sugary awesomeness.  The sauces are equally awesome.

All-in-all it was a fantastic meal and great experience.  Good food, good wine, good company.  I would come back any time to enjoy a steak or one of their burgers."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is the best meal I have ever had! We have traveled around the world and this was by far the best dinner. There were 4 of use celebrating 2 birthdays and we sat in the bar/lounge area. The bartenders were on top of all of our drinks and continuously refilling our waters. The service was top notch, from the servers, food runners to the mangers, everyone was very attentive. We tried several different items since there was 4 of us. For the appetizers we had the warm olives (yum) and house made pickles. Starters were tuna tartar ( which the food runner did a lovely presentation) and the Raviolis. You would never think a fine dinning would have the most incredible raviolis . They were one of my favorite dishes. Dinner we got the Filet, NY and the Cornish hen. All three were spectacular, I was super surprised how delicious the Cornish tasted. With dinner we asked for a bottle of wine to pair with our meat course and the Sommelier picked the perfect red wine. Lastly, was the very rich and delicious Bourbon bar. Our experiences was unforgettable and we look forward to going back in the future!"}
{"text":"What an incredible experience! This was our second time here and it was better than the first! Our server, Michael O., was incredibly attentive, knowledgeable, and willing to take a few of our bad jokes. We had all our questions answered and he was a perfect guide for our evening. The food is a one of a kind experience and really plays with unique flavor combinations. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Most important:VERY EXPENSIVE!!!  A filet, sautéed spinach, and shittake mushrooms cost me $70!  An iced tea $4. A latte $7.  Three beignets with chocolate sauce $9.  Food was delicious though, with outstanding service.  Think I would come here only for speciual occasions."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I recently celebrated our birthdays at Bourbon Steak with our husbands. The staff was knowledgable, friendly, and professional. The sommelier picked out some fabulous wines which paired beautifully with our meals. The tuna tartare is a must eat on the appetizer list. My husband I split a sirloin and the king crab with bearnaise. The sirloin was cooked to perfection, however I probably would not order the kind crab with bearnaise again. Bourbon Steak is the perfect place for a celebratory meal, especially during the holidays. The Fairmont Princess does a beautiful job with their holiday lights, however enjoy the lights prior to dinner as they turn off at 9pm."}
{"text":"I came here ready to write a review of Bourbon Steak but Larry S. beat me to it, almost word for word.

The only difference is that I had the Macallan 18 Butterscotch Pot de Creme: Nutmeg Beignets, Toffee Float for dessert.  It was excellent and I would order it again.

I would not visit Bourbon Steak if it weren't for the great deal during restaurant week, its just not worth full price."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about Bourbon Steak and am, in general, a big fan of Michael Mina's concepts as I had already visited Nob Hill Tavern at the MGM in Las Vegas but was a little disappointed  in my experience at Bourbon Steak at the Scottsdale Fairmont.  Let me start by saying that I don't have enough good things to say about their lounge, the selection of classic cocktails that you rarely find anywhere these days, even in high end restaurants, and the knowledge that our server had of these delectible cocktails.  Have you ever heard of a Sazerac?  It is rare to find a bar that has any idea of what this great cocktail is but our server not only knew of it but also knew the history behind it."}
{"text":"This was my first choice for Valentine's Day dinner since we were staying at the Fairmont. I booked a table for two through OpenTable.com, but when I checked the restaurant website, it said they were closed on Sundays. So did the voice recording I got. Hmm. Sooooooo, I quickly cancelled the reservation in favor of BLT Steak. 

We decided to check out Bourbon Steak another night, since every night seems to get you 1,000 points on OpenTable. Unfortunately we weren't super hungry and we'd already had steak, so it took us a long time to decide what to order.

This was complicated, though pleasantly so, by the arrival of the famous Michael Mina trio of duck fat fries, compliments of the restaurant. These little sticks of crispness were some of the best fries I've ever had. They were great on their own, but also came with a trio of sauces, including truffle aioli and a spicy ketchup. I hate cold fries when they get all soggy, but somehow these fries retained their uber-crispness even after they'd been at the table for a while.

I had originally planned to try one of their burgers because I also wanted the fries, then I considered the foie gras sliders as my entree. Finally, we decided to share a rib-eye. Honestly, the menu seemed limited compared to BLT Steak's, which was probably a good thing.

A small loaf of truffle oil-brushed focaccia appeared on our table shortly after we placed our order, but I had to request that the fries be left behind as the server whisked them away. The steak was quite good, and cooked medium-rare, as requested. It was served to us sliced, on the bone, since we were sharing. However, it was sliced purely by grain, not by cut, so one of us had more of the tender strip than the other. The side of squash that we'd ordered was nicely seasoned and a very large portion. All in all, I felt the food was good but not fantastic.

Even though we were comfortably full and originally planned to decline dessert, we were swayed by the beignets with a choice of three different accompanying puddings. My boyfriend couldn't resist the butterscotch pudding with a topping of Macallan 18-year-old Scotch. These little beignets were good, but the pudding was amazingly creamy, and topped with a sigh-inducing Scotch caramel sauce.

We have a Michael Mina restaurant in San Jose, and I would definitely try it after eating at Bourbon Steak. The promise of duck fat fries and Scotch pudding are definite draws, but so are the specials offered on certain nights at Bourbon Steak. If the hamburger nights and 50% off wine nights are available at Arcadia, you'll find me there soon with a bigger appetite, perhaps trying the lobster pot pie or a spiked shake.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Awful service. This place is owned and run by some crazy corporate people that have never been in the service industry. This is a classy place that was too cheap to finish the flooring and kept the concrete. They have decent happy hour but the drinks were warm and not good. They have a Ketel One Cosmo on the menu - that uses only Ketel One Citron - I asked for regular Ketel One and I could not have it on the Happy Hour price because some outside accounting firm measures all of their alcohol shots - WTF? Keep up the good work guys - I will NEVER be back. 
I should have fetched the manager, took him to Stone Rose across the hotel and showed him what is place could look like. Stone Rose has NO happy hour and $14 drinks - PACKED! Bourbon Steak - $7 drinks empty - any reason why that is?
Idiots!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing! I wish it was easier to dine at unfortunately. It was hard for me to get everyone to agree to come here for my birthday dinner because The Princess Resort wants to charge $85 PER CAR for valet. Absolutely the most absurd thing I have ever heard. We just want to come in dine, explore the wonderland (which is an additional cost) and we can't even Uber because they charge $20 at the door for drop offs per person. I was honestly flabbergasted at the price and it scared off a lot of my friends because all they could think was if the valet is $85 how much is the food?? But once I did get my group in for dinner everything was great from there. The food was amazing and the chef sent out a lot of complimentary appetizers for the table. The server was knowledgeable and distributed our separate checks with ease. The portions were a little small but everything was so amazing. I got the steak with mushrooms on top and the mac and cheese which was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Do not waste your money! So disappointed! Martini ... so-so. Prawns (3 for $30) were large, tasteless, and the sauces bland. Next a deconstructed Caesar salad, the best part was the cheese peelings ... go figure! Our medium rare New York was way too rare but it was so tough we couldn't eat it anyway! Asparagus, 10 tiny, vinegared spears ... like I said ... keep your wallet close and do yourself a favor by going somewhere else!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at Bourbon Steak  tonight and I have to say how fabulous our evening was at this establishment. Our servers, Logan and AJ were attentive, knowledgeable, informative and personable. The food was outstanding (trio of fries and sauces, Arancini, Gnudi for apps) and the Wagyu burger for the main. Our dessert was the beignets with Mc Callan butterscotch sauce....to die for!! It's a must to try Bourbon Steak."}
{"text":"This place just seems overpriced to me.  Good food, great service--- but not excellence as prices would suggest.  If someone else is paying, hey, have a ball!  I recommend the duck fat fries and one of the signature cocktails."}
{"text":"Michael Mina prices with Mickey Mouse food.

The restaurant is set in the beautiful Fairmont-Princess hotel; great bars abound on this property all worth a visit.  Going on the bars look I couldn't wait to see the restaurant, especially the bar adjoining the restaurant.  As I went to the bar, I did notice a restaurant, very bistro/casual almost thrown together.  This would be the dining room.  OUCH!  Staff was okay, maitre d was good.

I started with the chilled corn soup which was very good.  I followed it with the 32 ounce Porterhouse (T-Bone), order medium rare, this was not so good ($60).  The strip was cooked rare and the tenderloin was  medium-well , not quite the medium rare I ordered.  If you are \"fine dining\" and cannot cook a steak you need to find a new job.  Note to anyone - never send a steak back no matter where!  The side dishes come in small metal dishes ($9 a pop) - mushrooms (greasy); mac'n cheese (over-cooked); spinach (gritty).  I decided against dessert.  The wine list is mind blowing expensive and out of keeping for the restaurant, I wasn't exactly spoilt for choice as I looked for wines in the $80-125 range.

Cannot see coming back.  Just a very ordinary experience at a very high price."}
{"text":"What 8 word phrase can bring me to tears? Besides, \"Your BCS National Champions -  the California Golden Bears!\"?

That would be \"Whole fried chicken with truffled mac and cheese.\"

Yup, Michael Mina had me shedding happy tears all night. It started with the tasty and potent pear martini and the complimentary trio of duck-fat fries with dipping sauces and by the time our crispy chicken was presented at the table, I was single-handedly ending the drought. 

The chicken was one of the best I've eaten and friends, I've eaten lots of chicken in my short lifetime. The truffled mac & cheese? Well, let's just say that if I could bring some back to the room and eat it with my fingers at 3 am, I would. Oh wait, I did.

By the time our meal ended with the the molten chocolate cake, I was exhausted from all the eating and the weeping and more eating.

Thanks everyone for not kicking the crazy, crying lady out of your restaurant that night. She was just really, really happy."}
{"text":"Staying at the hotel and came here for

{"text":"The Sunday BBQ was incredible.  $49 was a steal for your choice of NY strip, chicken or salmon + sides + a buffet featuring salads, soups, kobe beef sliders, lobster rolls and a chilled seafood spread + a root beer float and warm chocolate chip cookies.

if they make this happen again next summer, I'd consider a trip back to Scottsdale just for this."}
{"text":"This place is 100% legit.

Service was fantastic, from our host to the waiter to the sommelier.

I had the filet which was the best I've had in AZ, cooked exactly how I like it with an amazing flavor.   

Our sommelier recommended an awesome cabernet that perfectly complimented the filet, Chad L. and I had no issues finishing the bottle ourselves.

All in all we had a fabulous meal, cannot wait to get back to Scottsdale and give this place another go."}
{"text":"Tucked away inside the beautiful Scottsdale Princess Resort is the only Michael Mina restaurant in Arizona, and it was A-Ok. I vascillate between 3 or 4 stars, but I think I'll stick with the 3. Here's why:

The customer service here was simply outstanding. The manager offered to take photos for us, struck up conversation regarding my restaurant likes and details of the restaurant, and even asked the bartender to comp us one of their signature drinks, the Cable Car. The service throughout the meal was also really great. 5 stars for Service.

The sides, and duck fat fries were also really amazing. For our sides, we had the shiitake mushrooms, asparagus, and on my plate was the horseradish mashed potatoes, and assorted veggies. I would come back just for the sides. The three flavors of duck fat fries + 3 dippings sauces came out compliments of the kitchen, and I wish I could have these every day. 5 stars for sides + fries.

To start, my friend and I shared the foie gras sliders,and I was a little bit disappointed. I think the idea was good, but there was definitely a lack in flavor. 2 stars for appetizer.

The entrees (2 filets and 1 prime beef short rib) were beautifully presented, but again, the flavors did not hit the spot. Although I enjoyed the sides on my plate, I had a really difficult time putting down the short rib due to the sweetness of meat. It was cooked perfectly, though, as the meat just fell onto my fork. My friend who had one of the filet mignons asked for medium well, but her plate was very bloody compared to the medium rare of our other friend. The one with the bloody plate also said she preferred Ruth Chris' filet. 2 stars for meats.

Lastly, we ordered the beignets for dinner. They were delicious, nice, soft pillows for your mouth I wish I could sleep on and eat every morning. It came with a Macallan 18 yogurt for dipping, and that was also awesome. 5 stars for dessert.  

I know the average of all of the whole experience is greater than 3... BUT to be called Bourbon Steak and carry the title of \"Best Steakhouse\" three years running, the meat carry the largest weight, and they definitely should've WOW-ed us there."}
{"text":"Restaurant was closed this evening due to our group renting the entire place for our sales convention. Fixed menu. Everything was excellent and flavorful, flank steak, potatoes mushrooms. Just not enough to go around the table."}
{"text":"Had such an amazing experience there.  Service was top notch, atmosphere is fantastic, and the steaks were excellent.  Great all around."}
{"text":"For about $130 and only trying a few appetizers and a round of drinks, this was probably one of the worst values in Scottsdale. Service was OK but the food served was not anything special, the highlight was the tartar."}
{"text":"I went for AZ Restaurant Week and got the $39 special.  

I went with the Roasted Lobster and Corn Bisque: Tempura Cream Corn, Spicy Apples as my 1st course, the Kobe Flat Iron Steak: Bone Marrow Potatoes, Three Way Onions, Pinot Noir Reduction as the entree' and the Seasonal Berry Parfait: Honey Granola, Frozen Yogurt as dessert. 

Sadly, overall, my expectations were not met by the food or the ambiance - only by the AWESOME service. 

The complimentary duck fat french fries were definitely above average.  I could not really tell anything about them that screamed \"DUCK FAT !!!\" but the seasonings on the fries and the sauces were all very tasty.  Not bad for \"free\" food !!!

The \"potato sponge bread\" or whatever that was they brought to the table was very \"meh.\"  Bland almost.  Forgettable.

The lobster and corn bisque was tasty and deserves a \"Bravo!\"  Met my expectations, maybe exceeded it a little bit. 

The Kobe Flat Iron, however, fell flat (pun intended.)  I have prepared a Kobe NY strip (which I purchased at A.J.'s Fine Foods for $39/lb.) at home on my grill that tasted better than the dish I got from Bourbon Steak.   

One would expect a Kobe steak to \"wow!\" you when you take that first bite and also that last bite, and in this case, it just did not happen.  The steak was not particularly flavorful, and was not particularly tender.  The onions overpowered the dish a bit, leaving me with a strong and unpleasant \"onion\" taste in my mouth for the rest of the night.

My advice on Kobe steak:  if you want an affordable Kobe experience, hit A.J.'s and grill it yourself at home.

The Berry Parfait was totally tasty.  Great ending for the meal - super-fresh fruit chunks, everything worked together very well.  I'd pay $8 for that on a menu.

The place was very loud.  It was only about half full, but the sound reverberates in that place.  Tables are close together so you get to hear your neighbor's conversations, barely, above the overall din.

The SERVICE WAS SPECTACULAR.  Within 5 minutes of sitting down, I had my order placed, water to drink, and duck fat fries on the table.  They never let me sit there waiting around for water, or to remove a completed dish - they were ALL over it like a good team.  I'd bet 6 or 7 different people served my table.  Service definitely was the best part of the experience.

So, in summary:  Would I take a date there and spend $150 per person?  NO.  Would I take advantage of another $39 special next year and try something new?  Quite possibly, yes."}
{"text":"Visited Bourbon Steak the night after Mastro's and Bourbon Steak disappointed - both in an absolute sense and relative to Mastro's.

I was sort of crammed in the back of a large table, so I may have been invisible to the waitstaff, but my water was never refilled and I was passed over for fresh wine about half a dozen times. I couldn't even get their attention by peering longingly in their direction in an effort to establish eye-contact.  Maybe they thought I was stalking them, but really I was just thirsty.

I ordered the filet (along with 3 others at my table) and it was improperly prepared (ordered medium, it came rare).  That was fine, I am not overly picky, but I thought it should have at least been warm.  It was actually COLD through and through when it got to the table.  Even this might have been fixed had the waitstaff ever asked, \"and how is your meal.\" but, they didn't, so...

If you are ever in Scottsdale and in the mood for a filet, I would probably skip Bourbon Steak and seriously consider Mastro's.  Oh, and if you go to Mastro's, get the lobster mashed potatoes to go with your steak, I hear they are amazing."}
{"text":"All the finest bourbons; Pappy, Whistlepig, Garrison Bros., High West.
And all the finest meats: Wagyu, (Kobe).

Now, put them together with a knowledgeable bartender and food server and you've got an experience that few restaurants can rival.

Plan on barfing up your kid's college fund to eat here, but it's well worth it.
You won't leave here upset over spending a bunch. 
You'll leave here talking with your date about how incredible the experience.

PS
Thanks to Texas' Garrison Brothers - who helped to keep me out of Sunday Easter Sunrise services."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times since and I love the beignets!  The duck fat fries that they serve in place of bread are AMAZING. The service varies, I have had amazing wait staff and disappointing wait staff for a restaurant on this level. It seems to be the luck of the draw but the food is wonderful if you are willing to splurge on cost."}
{"text":"The reason why expense accounts exist.  I'm not a huge 'steakhouse' guy and if I'm dropping some serious dough on a meal I prefer it to be more creative and nuanced.  Having said that, I have no qualms about someone else buying my dinner at a place like this.  

Probably my second favorite filet in the valley.  Exceptionally tender and full of flavor.  The sides were solid but sort of indistinguishable from other spots in the Valley like Mastros or Steak 44.  A true and unique highlight came at the end of the meal with the Bourbon Bar.  Top it off with a polished staff and a nice comfortable setting."}
{"text":"I am so in love with this restaurant,food is always excellent
My favorite item is definitely the stake with whipped mash potatoes and duck gravy the mac and cheese is a must 
I also love the lobster pot pie so delicious 
And last but not least the vignettes are to die for butterscotch sauce to dip in is the one 
I was so blown away by the service we had  a very late night dinner almost closing time and everyone make us feel so welcoming 
Specially Shawn and Michael they  are amazing they definitely know the menu so well and they are so charming make sure you ask for them they will make you feel like home 
Manager Ryan was super nice also he took the time to come to our table to make sure we were having a great experience and of course we were 
Thank you everyone and we will be back pretty soon"}
{"text":"I was so excited to go to bourbon! We only heard good things about this place. My gf and I came from la and SF to celebrate her bday (long distance relationship). We heard great things and my gf had a great experience in the Santa Clara location. Unfortunately the experience was not the greatest or even mediocre. The server took a long time to take our order, the table next to us got their order in even though they came 15 min after us. We were nice about it and ordered from another server. The food came out and the food runner was lost and did not know where to bring the food we had to flag him down to tell him it was our meal. The food itself was mediocre but not worth the $300 we paid between two people especially since it took so long for the food to come out. In the end I hoped that they would bring a good dessert since I did tell them it was a bday but they forgot which was very disappointing as we came all the way from different cities to meet for a special occasion. The manager was nice and brought us a glass of free champagne for the complaint but overall was still disappointing for a Michael mina restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for dinner between Christmas and New Year. The place was packed, and everything was flowing efficiently. Noise wasn't bad. Waiter and sommelier were professionals.

Located in the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess grounds: Nice bar...you can eat there at Happy Hour. But, the main show is the dining room, where the waiters and sommelier perform expertly. 

Get ready for the menu...lots of choices; and I recommend that you listen to the waiter's explanations (user assistance for the menu). It's key to your ability to order well.

What I came away with: the steaks are sublime, and so are the accouterments (mac & cheese (may have been a special item on our night), salt-baked potato with a huge array of traditional fixings, creamed spinach with smoked onion, sunchoke gratin with goat cheese sauce, and so on).

We had the 14 oz New York Strip...cut it in half ourselves, and that was plenty of steak for us. Very good steak by any standard.

But, even though the steak was sumptuous, the best part of the meal was the dessert (remember, \"life is uncertain, EAT dessert!\" ...  Ernestine Ulmer). We had the mascarpone cheesecake. This is a deconstructed cheesecake served with strawberries, raspberries, and pistachios. Short of Bavarian cheesecake from Munich, very nice! 

Bon appetit."}
{"text":"We came here in May, our server was Chris. We ended up all getting the Restaurant week menu.

I really liked the chilled asparagus soup.  They had fries as appetizer and a small sweet bite to finish our meal.

We all had the prime hanger steak, and 2 of us were very pleased with it. One of them however, was very tough. They offered to replace it and they did, but once they brought it back it was sliced and still tough... so it seemed it was the same one, just sliced... Had it been in one piece I would not have that suspicion...
Anyway, it was still not meeting the expectations... I did try it and it was in fact very tough, even hard to swallow, which was very weird because mine was delicious.

Everyone at the restaurant was very nice and friendly.

The other thing is that when I got home I noticed I had lost a small device. I called them and the hostess I spoke to confirmed someone had turned it in. I stopped by a couple of days later and my item was not in the lost and found records or items, I spent over half an hour there because I could not believe it, however no one was able to help me.
Such a disappointment, for a place like this, this was overall a not very good experience."}
{"text":"Bourbon Steak is the Scottsdale outpost for celebrity chef, Michael Mina, and also the    high-end restaurant at the Fairmont Princess.  The restaurant tries to be everything to everybody and falls short of everyone's expectations.   As with Mina's other restaurants, the interior is monochrome, ultra-modern with sharp, angular furniture.  The staff are energetic and photogenic as any trendy Scottsdale hotspot.  The schizophrenic nature of the restaurant starts with the loud 90's/00's music.  Not what I'm expecting at a high-end eating establishment - but hey, it's Scottsdale, I assumed they were going for a hipper vibe. The dining room is open concept and there's nothing to dampen loud music / conversation / screaming babies.  The clientele is a mixed bag of out-of-town guests of the hotel, young hipster foodies with money, and the elder Scottsdale diners.  When I was seated in the dining room, the other diners were adults.  But as the evening progressed, several different dining parties with a gaggle of under 10 children were seated around  me.  Some elder Scottsdale types who were about to be seated  took one look at those diners with under 10's, and immediately asked to be moved as far away from them as possible.  I had front row view of a two year old spitting half masticated food into her mother's hand.  Unfortunately, I was 3/4 of the way done with my meal, and so I valiantly carried on through the caccophany of running children / screaming babies / and young parents unable/unwilling to teach their children appropriate dining behavior. All of this could have been assuaged had the food been spectacular, but it was surprisingly mediocre.  The scallop sashimi with compressed nectarine and passionfruit vinegarette was a bust.  The flavors just didn't work.  The asparagus was cooked well, but the sauce Gribiche which was made table-side was not whipped adequately and so the sauce was never emulsified.  My dining experience at Bourbon Steak can be summarized as disastrous.  As long as you don't expect delicious food or a sophisticated adult dining experience, but a very expensive hotel restaurant then you'll be OK."}
{"text":"Here is the real skinny on this place.

Great ambiance - like the decor
1.  Liked the foie gras - definitely worth it
2. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE OYSTERS- terrible and so small.  Should have been $1/oyster instead of 3/oyster 
3.  Wine collection is great - we brought our somalier to dinner and she was impressed
4.  Food took a while to come out
5.  I had the wayagu flat iron a tasted like crap (like a tire).  I had a steak at the Spanish restaurant the night before that was so much better and 1/8 the cost
6. Sides were ok - mac and cheese, mushrooms and baked potato were great - fried rice was not cooked thoroughly 
7.  I b*tched about the bad oysters so they enriched the desserts - desserts were average.
8. Lobster pot pie was not all that they mAke it out to seem - it's just a metal pot with a fancy puff pasty on top - not worth it.

Overall - Disappointed...."}
{"text":"Came here for Restaurant week
Anchor Steam $7
Ketel One dirty martini $14
Old Cuban $13
Truffled Mac and Cheese $9

As everyone else mentions, their duck fat fries are a very nice touch, different than your usual bread.
BF had the pistachio crusted halibut which he loved (I thought it was lacking in... flavor). I had the filet, which was great!
For dessert I had the strawberry \"cheescake\", which I'm not sure if it's on the usual menu,but it was basically mascarpone cheesecake Filling, no crust, piped onto the plate in decorative little blobs.Though very small, it was delicious, reminding me my fat rear doesn't need a crap ton of sugar+fat for dessert. BF had the bourbon-y pudding dessert, which again, he loved.

I think it would be Underwhelming to come back and pay full price, but it's a good value during Restaurant Week."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed dining here on NYE and it was extremely delicious! This restaurant is situated inside the Princess and has a great atmosphere. It's lively and overlooks one of the pools. It's much more open and airy than other steakhouses. The service was excellent and we were treated to five star customer service from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. Once our waiter learned that I was expecting he made sure to only serve me food that was pregnancy approved as well! 

The only downfall of the night was when we arrived and learned that it was a required prix-fixe meal. We made our reservations several weeks in advance and when we did, they didn't mention the mandatory prix-fixe meal. They called us two days prior to our reservation to confirm and when we spoke with them they still didn't mention the prix-fixe. It wasn't until we were seated on NYE that the waiter placed the menu in front of us and we learned that we didn't have the option to simply order off the menu. This resulted in the meal being much more expensive then we planned and it also limited us from getting to enjoy the items on the menu we would have liked to (I was itching to try the Lobster pot pie). The meal ended up being spectacular and we enjoyed a several hour event with five courses of sublime food, but it would have still been nice to have been warned prior to the meal. 

However, because this was NYE and a special night out, we looked past the prix-fixe issues and thoroughly enjoyed our night! The meal was fun and delicious and we enjoyed the Princess NYE party after the meal which was free for guests and diners of the restaurant to attend. 

I would definitely recommend a visit to Bourbon Steak but if it's a holiday, confirm their menu with them first!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of trying out their new Bar menu which is a burger lovers paradise. They bring you a clip board, a pencil then you go to town.. choose the meat, beef, lamb, salmon, and falafel.. then chose your toppings, from cheese to foie and everything in between.. the burgers are on the pricey side but do come with either duck fat fries or red onion rings. 

Both of the burgers we ordered, beef, medium rare, were very good but the portion to price ratio is off.. burgers are smallish plus we both had bacon on our burgers ($3 upcharge) but, it was only one slice cut in half.. Come on, really? For a $14 burger plus $3 bucks for bacon, put some fucking bacon on it! Seriously! 

While I think I would have given the bar 4 stars I can not based on the price and while tasty, that little shitty piece of bacon."}
{"text":"Excellent service decent steak. Food wise, I would only give it a 3 however the service knocked it up to a 4. I had the flatiron Wagyu and my friend had the rib eye. They were both cooked nicely (medium rare) however his lacked in flavor....it needed more seasoning. The wine list is insanely overpriced. We are used to buying $100 bottles of wine however the majority of wines were $120+.  I always appreciate a good meal however I would come back for the service."}
{"text":"I have been to this steak house few times .. Love there flat iron tender steak and truffle oil and asiago  Mac and cheese .. They are just yummy only complain I have while service is Great we felt rushed .."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner experience! We had dinner on Christmas night. Set menu that evening with choice of wine pairing. The meal was glorious... Especially the chestnut soup with scallops. Service was spot-on! We had a wonderful evening and can't wait to return!"}

{"text":"I have been to Bourbon Steak for their annual Kentucky Derby Party, however, I had never taken the time to go in for dinner even though it is literally 2 miles from my house. We decided to go in for light appetizers and a few drinks. Everything was amazing!  Thanks in part to our phenomenal waiter, Jeremy. His recommendations were absolutely outstanding and on point. It was THE BEST appetizer \"dinner\" we have ever had. When you go, and you should, make sure to ask for Jeremy...the man knows what he's talking about!"}
{"text":"Terrible! First, we had a reservation and asked not be be seated in a main walkway..you guessed it..we were put in a main aisle. Next we ordered a filet mignon medium well..it came out 'on the hoof' rare..RED RED RED! The other steak was good. When the raw steak was sent back, 10 mins later the same bloody steak was brought back out..the steak was again sent back. This time the steak was ONLY SLIGHTLY better cooked, still RED and this time about 50% smaller in size. Apparently from what I can tell is these steaks are so infused with water, oil/fat that the cook is AFRAID to serve more than rare as the food would be the size of a postage stamp. So now back to the steak..this last time the meat was a bit more cooked, 50% smaller and tough. The potatoes and spinach were very small and barely enough to eat for two people--considering each of these SMALL portions was over $12 each..what a disgrace! This is a shame as each SMALL serving of 'sides' was all this other person could eat since the horrible steak was largely inedible. I will say however the manager 'comped' the one inedible steak, however the point of going to this restaurant was to EAT, not to get a freebie!! 
After leaving with one of us hungry from the inedible steak and my also feeling somewhat hungry and annoyed, we were both feeling like some good/real food and were hungry that we had to go to another restaurant on the way home..this is a first I have had to do this in my life.. Oh, and on another note, take away the nice lobby, the restaurant itself was 'minimalist' in nature..hard seating, uncomfortable, echoey, very underwhelming! I eat regularly at Flemings, Morton's and Dominics..all are FAR superior to this overpriced, uncomfortable, ripoff called a 'restaurant! Buyer beware!!!"}
{"text":"In the past I was in complete ahh with your standard run of the mill steakhouse. I stumbled upon this fine steakhouse by accident and I am thrilled that I did. Move over Mastros there is a new boss in town. Upon arriving here you are greeted with three flavorful varieties of French fries with house sauces. We ordered a vast selection of appetizers and salads. The tuna tartare was exceptional, fresh and fancy! I also had the beet salad. The beets had a tangy taste that kept me wanting more. Next on the chopping block was the delightful 8 ounce steak cooked medium. From beginning to end this Steak was cooked to perfection. Flavorful crispy outside pink middle filled with succulent beef juices. Paired with this godly steak was a couple of crispy Brussels sprouts that are so addicting. I also had a baked potato which was super delicious. What can I say from beginning to end this place is five diamonds."}
{"text":"This is a great steakhouse with great services. The fries trio from the chef came with three types seasonings and corresponding sauces. Great start to go with the sparkling. Tuna tartare was good and the waiter mixed in the ingredients in front of us. Fillet mignon and ribeye were cooked to the right doneness. Side of mushroom and baked potatoes are fine too. Nothing was wrong with any dish, but I would have expected more surprises - could be the cooler decor inside and outside, more comfy chairs, more innovative ingredients or presentations. Just need something to light it up and make the experience special. Overall, the food and the services were solid."}
{"text":"Anniversary dinner:  Reservations at Bourbon Steak.  We were promptly greeted at Bourbon Steak with a card signed by all of the staff, congratulating us on our anniversary. Great welcome! We were then seated at a private romantic table and were waited on by Justin. He was extremely professional, and welcomed us for our anniversary. We started with some cocktails, recommended to our likings by Justin. They were hand-crafted and wonderful. Exactly in tune with our likes and preferences.  We ordered our meal, and were surprised when Chef Jeremy McMillian decided to spoil us with multiple tastings from the kitchen, courtesy of Bourbon Steak. One after the other, we were greeted by exquisite single portion tastes of the finest foods we have eaten, creations with a depth of thought and emotion put into each concoction. Each tasting was a new experience to savour in its own creative explosion of flavour. In fact, it was such a meal to remember, we asked Justin, our server, to email us what we had eaten. 

Our incredible meal was as follows, and a very big personal thank you to Chef Jeremy McMillian:

Amuse 1:  Trio of Duck Fat Fries  Ranch fry with fancy sauce. Bacon fry with BBQ sauce, Old Bay fry with Tartar Sauce

Amuse 2: Wild Mushroom Arinchini w/ Pecorino Fondue

Appetizer: Fresh Hand pulled Mozzerella Salad w/ Poached pear, Shaved Speck (smoked Prosciutto), and arugula

Entree:  Mixed Grill w/ Two Wash Ranch Guinea Hen, Prime \"Coulotte\" Sirloin, Prime Rib Cap, and Prime NY \"Pave\"

Dessert:  Apple Financier w/ almond cake and Butter Ice Cream

 It was a dining experience that will not be soon forgotten. We eat at many 5 star restaurants from Vancouver to Seattle to Scottsdale, and in between, and this was one of our very top experiences to date, from the level of professional service, to the quality and creativity of the food. It left no room for disappointment in any category. 
 We then returned to our room, enjoyed a scotch in front of the cozy fireplace, took a bubble bath in the giant tub in our suite, and retreated to bed. 
 The Fairmont Scottsdale Princess from check in to check out, was a 6 star experience, and I must say, has ensured our return for every anniversary going forward. The Fairmont knows how to treat their clients. We have stayed at many 5 star Scottsdale resorts, and many luxury resorts around the world, and this was by far the best experience we have ever had at any price level we have paid. Thank you Fairmont Scottsdale Princess. Your level of attention to detail, professionalism, luxury offerings, and the simple \"know how to treat your clients\" has been greatly appreciated and noted.  You made our first wedding anniversary absolutely perfect! We would not have changed a single thing!"}
{"text":"Took some clients here- great setting, the walk up is amazing and the valet and service was quite nice. The restaurant was packed, so it was loud and unruly. I had the steak and it was quite good, but also quite expensive. It came with almost nothing and we had to get sides to make it a meal. The wedge salad was just ok- with too little dressing and the dressing was not well placed. The wine list was quite extensive but once I saw the price I decided that we would not be drinking wine- it was unproportionally expensive. I did talk to their somalie and he was quite knowledgeable and helpful, but with their prices, I had to pass on wine.

Food: 4
Atmosphere: 3
Service: 4
Parking: 4
Wine: 1
Value: 2

This is a VERY expensive restaurant and mediocre value for what you get. The food is good, which is a saving grace, but just very expensive."}
{"text":"This review is for May 20, 2013. We made reservations to celebrate my birthday. We arrived a little early and were greeted warmly. The ambience is very nice, quite, private and romantic. I especially loved the low lighted wine cellar on display, as soon as you arrive. We were greeted by our server and he went out of his way to explain their concept, as well as describing all the menu items. He also explained the restaurant week menu, but we opted for the regular menu. 

My fiancé ordered the Market Oysters, I can't remember the type of oysters, but these were amazing. He grew up in the South of France, right by the ocean, and said these were the best he ever had. I completely agreed. My mom ordered the \"Bacon and Egg\", this was amazing crispy perfect pork belly with frisee and a panko fried poached egg. This dish was perfection as well. I ordered the foie gras appetizer. Foie gras perfectly seared, served with brioche toast points, the most amazing wild strawberries, and a rhubarb jam. Every appetizer was divine.

We are all ribeye lovers, and each of us ordered a ribeye. The mesquite, butter poached steaks are amazing! These steaks aren't served with any sauce and you don't need it at all. Each of our steaks were perfectly cooked. We ordered the Waygu fried rice, White Cheddar Hashbrows, and Asparagus with truffle oil, poached egg and parmesan. We enjoyed the sides, the only one that was okay was the fried rice. We were quickly filled up and had plenty of leftovers. 

We also enjoyed a very nice bottle of Cabernet, and there is a very exceptional wine and cocktail list. For dessert we enjoyed the beignets. They were very delicious. My fiancé enjoyed their specially blended, just for Bourbon Steak, Cognac. He loved this Cognac and I know he wishes he could purchase a bottle. 

This was an absolute divine dining experience. This will definitely be our special occasion place."}
{"text":"I will make this one short and sweet. This is the second chef Mina restaurant I have been to in the last month ( American Fish in Vegas). I would go back to any of his establishments in a heart beat.

We had two dozen oysters, duck fat french fries, foie gras sliders, duck fat fried chicken with truffle mac and cheese, bone in prime rib, creme brulee, and the cheesecake pistachio streusel. Ohhhhh my lord did I just say that! It ended up being top five meals of my life. So F-ing delicious I shed a tear just thinking of it. If you ever have the chance to try any of  Michael Mina's places don't even think twice about it, JUST DO IT!

Service= 5 stars,  Ambiance= 5 stars,  Food= OFF THE CHARTS!"}
{"text":"Bourbon Steak was the highlight of Arizona Restaurant Week. I have been wanting to come here for a long time so when they were listed for ARW, I was on board. You can't go wrong, starting with the atmosphere: you pull up to valet at The Fairmont Scottsdale Princess and make your way through the walkway adorned with wine bottles into the the dark, sexy lobby.

In stark contrast the restaurant is white stone with modern, minimalist decor....and great music playing. We start off with the complimentary serving of duck fat french fries, three servings each dusted with a different kind of seasoning and dipping sauce.

I started with the bacon and egg, which is pork belly and breaded soft boiled egg accompanied with kimchi and basil. The farm salad also looked fresh-from the garden delicious and bountiful.

 For my main I had the filet mignon which was cooked up a perfect medium rare that you could almost cut with a fork. It was one of the best pieces of meat I've ever had-VERY flavorful and satisying. I also got to try the salmon. Now I HATE salmon because it is almost always smoked, which I cannot stand. Their salmon is grilled, not smoked, is light and flaky without being dry and is topped with a light crusting. I would come back her for the salmon (or a steak, or both!)

For my dessert I had the strawberry shortcake with basil gelatto....doesn't get better than this, right. WRONG! I got to try the butterscotch pot de creme with beignets. There was booze in the butterscotch.....need I say more?????

We finished off the evening with a nightcap at Stone Rose. It was the first cool night of autumn so how better to top things off than a drink under the stars by a fire????

Great success of an evening and well done to Bourbon Steak.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing place! The food was great but our server was even better! Sarah took care of us the entire night and made it such a wonderful experience. Can't wait to dine here again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's Michael Mina's steakhouse in the Princess. It's very modern inside with candles and fireplaces outside. The waiters were very friendly and had a good knowledge of the menu. They are attentive with water refills and clearing the table. The pacing was excellent.

The bread to start was fresh and had a slight char on it from the grill. The compound butter served with it had great flavor.

For my appetizer, I had the octopus, charred and served with fried chickpeas and harissa. The octopus was so tender it cut with a fork. The flavor was unbelievable. This is one of the most difficult dishes to execute and they nailed it.

The oysters were so fresh and served with ponzu sauce on the half shell. 

The 20 ounce ribeye was a perfect medium rare and seasoned excellently. One of the best ribeyes I've had. The fat was rendered very well for medium rare that it cut like butter.

The charred Brussels, hash browns, and spinach were also wonderful. The portion sizes were great as well.

For dessert, the candy bar and beignets were amazing. 

All in all, probably one of the best steakhouses in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Unbelievably true five star restaurant in the valley! You must try the broccoli, I kid you not it is amazing. Snake River flat iron steak...wow. Huge flavor and Jason pulled out a bottle of the best wine I have had outside of my personal collection!. And to finish with Beniets dipped in creme Brule......most amazing meal and service I have had in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Duck fries would have been a perfect start if it started with it. It didn't come out until dessert came out for the kids. Came here hoping to be wowed and found nothing. It's my second time at Bourbon steakhouse. Actually, I was disappointed in the San Jose, ca location, but said I would give this another chance as it was another location. We had to ask anyone who walked by just to get assistance since our waiter was too busy with other guests. Fine dining such as these are known for their food and the experience to be memorable. Well, it was a memorable night for me. Unfortunately, a great disappointment. I was so disappointed that we spent $300 on a meal for basically two with a server who didn't give a dam. I only gave a two stars because at least the manager was somewhat apologetic. After seeing the 3.5 Yelp star reviews I thought I would give the place a chance in hopes that a Michael Mina restaurant would be above a 4 star.. However like the others that reviewed with low stars.. I have to sadly agree that it is not a restaurant where I am willing to spend my money on."}
{"text":"Went for the first time as I've been wanting to go forever!! Honestly, I had the most amazing experience & it was JUST what I needed! Fantastic meal & we LOVED our server Jeremy!!! He shared his favorites & details on dishes & helped us pair wines! Loved the filet! BIG thanks to Jeremy for creating a memorable experience with every detail covered!"}
{"text":"This is how food should be cooked for everybody. The menu is exquisite, The plating presentation is phenomenal. The food is outstanding. My steak was cooked perfectly. The potatoes that were cooked with duck fat are heavenly. Absolutely impeccable dinner service. Staff was super friendly and the ambience was awesome. Just an all-around great time! Highly recommend it if you're in the area"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner. We had the tasting menu that we purchased through Travel Zoo for $125 for two. Each course was incredible. Unique tastes and just the right amount of food. (They are small portions, hence why they call it a tasting menu). 
The service was impeccable, all the staff was very attentive. I would definitely return for dinner again.

Surprisingly there were quite a few families with kids dining there at the same time, it's certainly an expensive place to take children."}
{"text":"When we first walked into the restaurant from the entrance doors it looks amazing.

Then it started to head downhill quickly.

Wine list... amazing. Be sure to take a second mortgage on your home prior to ordering, as the prices will shock you. As I have a VERY extensive wine cellar, with many of the wines that are on the BS list, the prices are way above what would be considered normal mark up.

Ended up ordering beer. 

Then... the food menu. Again, incredibly over priced.
With so many incredible restaurant choices in Phoenix, these prices were VERY HIGH. Then, your meal arrives... very small portions, including the sides.
My Alaskan Halibut was undercooked. My wife's pork was incredibly fatty, and way over spiced. She should know, as she is a chef.

Our friend ordered a Ceasars salad and a 8oz filet. They were happy with their meals.

Was headed to the Glendale California BS restaurant, next week with friends, cancelled our reservations.

Really too bad, as we always make it a point to go out with our friends when we are in Phoenix, and this was my pick fpr restaurant's. Bad call!"}
{"text":"We came for Restaurant Week & didn't even order off the menu. Everything looked good, but the regular menu looked even better so we went with that. The fries are a nice touch to the meal but I wish I hadn't eaten so many since I was pretty full after finishing them. We started with the ahi tuna tartare app which was fabulous. I can see why it's a popular item on their menu.

For my entree, I ordered the scallops. Not a big fan of peaches, but I actually enjoyed them and they complimented the scallops very well. We ordered a side of truffled mac & cheese which I thought was way too rich - we only ate a bite & had to stop and bring it home to finish the next day. Dessert looked fabulous but we were in the mood for froyo so we passed.

Service was great - since we told them it was our first time coming to the restaurant & we were locals they gave us a 20% card for our next visit. We will definitely use it, as this restaurant is far from cheap. 

Beautiful restaurant both inside & out - the patio is gorgeous. Come ready to eat & definitely spend some money."}
{"text":"Great night out. Logan, not only knows the menu cold,, but delivers the meat HOT!!!!!  Thanks Logan!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Scottsdale.  From start to finish Bourbon Steak is exceptional.  The hostesses, waiters, bus boys go out of the way to make our experience 5 Stars.  The food is always outstanding.  The steaks were mouth watering.  We also like the complimentary french fries brought to us with dipping sauces.  We dine here 2 to 3 times a month.  Sometimes more.  We always bring friends that are first time diners and they are always happy.  This is our first choice restaurant for our birthdays and anniversaries.  
You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place! Made all the better by Matt Doerr!  best bar commander I've ever run into!"}
{"text":"Food was incredible, I absolutely loved the ambiance of the restaurant. My boyfriend and I took a staycation and decided to try out bourbon steak and could not have been happier with our decision. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. Todd was our server and couldn't have been more charming and professional. He recommended the ribeye cap and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"OMG, thank you Michael Mina for opening the best steakhouse in the Valley.  The Kobe tartare is absolutely incredible.  The tapioca crusted red snapper...beyond words.  And of course their steaks (I've tried the rib eye cap and filet) are absolutely decadent.  (I don't think I'll ever attempt to blow $150 on their A5 Kobe cut).  I'm still trying to comprehend why I wasn't wowed by the lobster pot pie since it's a Mina signature dish.  The presentation was very nice but I wasn't excited about lobster being covered in a heavy sauce.  Top notch service, beautiful interior and their wine list kicks ass!"}
{"text":"We started off with the pride merlot. It is the best merlot you can ever drink. Then we progressed to the seafood platter, which was to die for."}
{"text":"The staff and chef were super accommodating to my mom's garlic allergy. They also made special vegetarian gluten free complimentary food in place of the bread or duck fat fries. The food was all a little salty for my taste, but the meat eaters all seemed thrilled."}
{"text":"We dined at Bourbon Steak to celebrate my husband's birthday this past June.   We had a reservation and were seating immediately upon arriving. 
 
They start off with three different types of French Fries which our daughter (8) loved!  We did too but were not fans of the third fry (a Cajun fry).

Appetizer:  Shrimp Cocktail

Dinner:  Filet with the most amazing seasoning, Bone-in rib eye with white cheddar hasbrowns (these were a hit!) and our daughter had sliders.  She said these were the best sliders she had ever had!

Desert:  Carrot Cake - delicious and the presentation is an \"A\", Valrhona Chocolate Custard and Ice Cream.

Service:  Excellent

Price:  Expensive 

We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went to Bourbon Steak a few nights ago. We had a great experience and the food was excellent! The whole staff was so friendly and helpful guiding us through the menu(I always have questions).... not to mention what a beautiful restaurant with industrial charm. Loved the whole experience and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend cooks the best steak ever... And when I go to a steakhouse it's always tough to beat and my expectation is that it must be much better than he can cook...bourbon steak gave us a fantastic meal, great service and everything cooked perfectly...great wine selection and recommendation for us.  We invited our adoptive parents with us to dinner and everyone enjoyed, thank you!"}
{"text":"This was the best meal I have had in a VERY long time. Every single bite was a delight to the taste buds and the service was perfect.  I had the yellowtail and the spices and sauce complimented each bite in a different way. My friend's snapper with basamati was amazing with the berries in the rice adding a great flavor. Husband got steak which is grass fed and free range, and it melted in your mouth! We had our 14 year old with us who wanted a burger and the server accommodated by allowing her to order something that was normally only available on the bar menu.

Save room for dessert. We had the Strawberry \"cheesecake\" which was the best and the others got the beignets  with creme brulee..PERFECTION.

The ONLY slight knock is that the music was WAY too loud for a place that charges what they do for food. If I go to a nice place I don't want to have to yell to be heard. They did turn it down when we asked but it doesn't suit the place to have loud bar music blasting."}
{"text":"Christmas here is magical. The atmosphere and dining experience were superb. My mom and I had a memorable evening. We will return. 
Nothing negative about this review."}
{"text":"Never been here before but wanted to take my boyfriend out for a birthday dinner. The atmosphere is charming. Warm and welcoming surroundings. The choice of food is lovely. Our meals were fantastic! What made the evening even better was our server Sarah. She made the night so special she was fast and so knowledgeable. Very very funny and created a really fun enviornment for us. She was on it for everything we needed. For sure a night to remember."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. The service was beyond acceptable, the food was adequate. The Lobster Pot Pie was covered in heavy brown gravy, ordered steaks medium rare, came medium, had to ask for bread, had to ask for plates for bread, ask for plates for appetizers, took two napkins away and had to ask to replace. Ordered a great bottle of wine, after first pour, ended up pouring our own! Will say that it was a birthday celebration and there was a card signed by the GM & Chef, also they sent a dessert with Happy Birthday wishes. Not returning any time soon, the chairs were so uncomfortable we asked to be moved to a booth and were told they only seat 2....there were 4 of us."}
{"text":"The entrance to the resturant was impressive; a corridor lined with thousands of wine bottles. The dark lighting and poignant accents set a mood of opulence. 

The layout of the restaurant was that of any fine dining establishment; beautiful seating, brilliant utensils, decorative pieces of art. We were a party of 14 with a Corporate credit card, my expectations were set high. 

Our server was young, polite and inexperienced for a restaurant of this caliber. His mistakes were due to lack of experience, training and support.  Specials of the day were shared with the far end of the table only. We expected a more engaging server with expert product knowledge.  

Our dining experience lasted 3.5 hours with huge gaps in between courses, this included cocktail service.  My wife's second cocktail arrived after the meal. 

This nights dinner was the last night of a long weekend of five star dining.  We ordered light.  My wife and I both ordered the 8 oz. filet, medium and split a blue cheese wedge.  The salad was separately plated and peppered at the table. The wedge lacked flavor and needed salt that was nowhere to be found.  

My wife's filet was cooked to a perfect medium. After the first cut it was obvious my filet was on the rare side of medium rare.  The customary table visit after the meal was set down was non existent.  I had to flag down a server to have the filet checked. When the filet was returned, quite some time later, I was down to only 5 oz.  Expecting the temperature to be perfect at this point was just not the case.  The filet was now a solid medium rare.  By this time our friends were nearly finished with their meal.  Unacceptable for a high end steak house.  Furthermore if you use Ruth's Chris as an example of a perfect 10, this filet was a 7.

The sides were small and over priced. We brought a special bottle of wine to share and complement wine from the wine list.  They did not offer corkage fee and requested we ordered exclusively off the wine menu.  

I expected more for a meal that cost nearly $2,000.  Don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"Ambiance was good, however it was ruined when the couple behind us started cursing and fighting so loud that all the other tables around us could hear clearly. This went on for about 30 min or so. This is not the reason for 3 stars though. The main reason for 3 stars is that the place is way overpriced for what you get. 

I had the Lobster Pot Pie ($75) and it was good but not great, wife had the Filet ($50) also good. We shared the Tuna Tar Tar, not impressed, and the horseradish potatoes, they were good.

Everything came to $260 with drinks. All in all, I feel like I've had much better dinners for under $100. Main reason for 3 stars is value."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but it was disappointing, and in the ways that mean the most.

The Caesar salad was very good but you have to try hard to screw that up.

The creamed spinach had a mesquite smokiness to it. Cute idea but Creamed spinach should never taste like mesquite. I could not finish it.

Had the 8oz filet. It was over cooked and was also over seasoned with whatever salt seasoning they use. With too much salt and the over cooking it  also made the meat dry.

Really sad. Beautiful restaurant. The duck fat fries they offer when you sit down are nice, drinks are good too. It was just the food preparation that was disappointing. I think this place may need a new head chef that knows the difference between edgy cuisine and stupid (mesquite creamed spinach). They probably also need to get their line cooks trained a bit better so they aren't destroying perfect cuts of meat with too much seasoning and not knowing when a filet is cooked to the ordered temperature."}
{"text":"Came here for Thanksgiving. Overall, the food was very good. Was disappointed that we couldn't taste the truffles in the lobster pasta appetizer. (Probably would have been thrilled with the app, if they hadn't listed it as having truffles.) The turkey was fantastic, but the vegetarian risotto was a bit too healthy for Thanksgiving (maybe some cream instead of water to cook it?) and the stuffing was a bit dry. Mashed potatoes were good, pass on the potatoes au gratin.

The dessert definitely took the cake (no pun intended). The pumpkin one was AMAZING. The chocolate and apple pie were both really great too, but the pumpkin one was just phenomenal."}
{"text":"First time and last time there.  To start, the side Caesar salad has no flavor and better yet, no dressing.  Ordered the Ahi Tuna which had no flavor once again, no seasoning whatsoever.  Side dishes are $11 a piece, so your main course is just your meat which looks ridiculous.  I ordered the baked potato which once again, had no flavor and was very dry. The cost for a glass of wine here is amazing.  It's nice to sit on the patio but the cost and overall taste of food is not there."}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant my Wagyu steak was fantastic! We sat at the bar and our bartender Sage was very personable, gave us great recommendations and excellent service! I loved it here and will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and cool vibe. Fantastic thanksgiving 3 course meal. Todd was very attentive and had great recommendations. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Worst fine dining experience I have ever had last night.  it took half an hour to get a wine list.  The server went away and told us our selection was not available.  Then the sommelier informed us that was an old wine list. He made a decent recommendation but that took another half hour.  Still no one had taken our order.  She finally took our order and was bitchy.  We got our salad 45 minutes later.  Very plain for what we paid.  The steak arrived 30 minutes after they cleared salad plates (an hour and 15 after we ordered and 2 hours and 15 minutes after we sat down) cold and flavorless.  It sickens me that we had to pay so much for such a lousy experience and they meal tool a total of 3 hours from arrival to departure."}
{"text":"Don't let the haters fool you, Bourbon Steak is an excellent restaurant. Yes it's expensive but that's to be expected -- it's a Michael Minna restaurant in a swanky hotel. That being said, they do a great job of making staple American cuisine as fancy as humanly possible (lobster pot pie anyone?)

I don't have any complaints about this place but I do have a couple observations:

-It's very easy to order too much food. The complimentary duck fat fries eliminate the need to order appetizers

-The beignets I had for dessert were good but not mind-blowing. I'd probably get a different dessert next time.

-The Eagle Rare bourbon is probably the best overall value on their bourbon list. Try it in a manhattan.

That said, Bourbon Steak is a great option for upscale dining in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Andrew Mcgloughlin at the Bourbon steakhouse was fabulous. He gave us the best customer service I have ever had at a restaurant it was a very busy night after a long late conference and he got us a great table. The customer service didn't stop there he checked on us made sure everything was OK and even got us some little snacks. He really made a difference in our experience. Thank you Andrew!

Our waiter Justin was also great. We will come back."}
{"text":"I wish I could remember our server's name. He was great! I really enjoyed the ambiance here and the wonderful service from ALL of the staff. I stayed at the Princess over Fourth of July weekend and the restaurant was busy but you wouldn't even know. I hardly waited a moment without someone coming by to fill my water, ask if we needed anything, or bring food to our table. I ordered the chilled corn soup for an app and I can't stop thinking about it. We ordered the lobster pot pie to share (sorry we didn't order more, we felt fat from eating and drinking all day). But the pot pie wasn't  small by the way. The presentation alone makes this dish worth it. Such fun! Everything was so nice and I would love to come back and take advantage of the wine list next time too! Thank you for a great dinner and awesome service! :-)"}
{"text":"I dined at Bourbon Steak recently and was really impressed. I have been to many of the valley's fine steakhouses and loved the casual atmosphere (unlike the stuffy Capital Grille). Everyone from the hostess to the manager seemed thrilled we could join them for dinner.  The amuse bouche fries were very pleasant and I couldn't stop myself from picking before the appetizers came out.  I enjoyed the Hamachi Sashimi which was nice and light and a little fun, but not exactly amazing.  My husband had the steak which was wonderful and I had the fried chicken.  This fried chicken was awesome, wonderful flavor,and a no-bone chicken breast atop mac and cheese with a wonderful onion jus that really balanced the dish and made it pop.  For dessert my husband almost licked the bowl of the butterscotch pudding while really enjoyed my super thick and creamy chocolate custard. Then as the check arrived a nice little bag of caramel popcorn was dropped off to take home. How nice! Everything was wonderful except for the waiting. This is the one downside to Bourbon Steak, and what kept it from being 5 stars. A coke would sometimes take 10 minutes and dessert took 15. Always presented with a smile and apology for the wait...but still a shame.  I would totally recommend, just understand it may take a little longer than expected."}
{"text":"Bourbon Steak - Round 2!
Bourbon is definitely a rare treat for me, and well worth the wait! I had dinner here on Friday night with a friend (AND NO KIDS!!) & it was easily the best night I've had in a year! While, no children and adult conversation were surely key contributors, the atmosphere and food for absolutely phenomenal!

My friend tried the \"double mule\" but not being a grapefruit fan, I opted for the margarita(s). Surprisingly, I really liked her drink as well, you could taste the ginger in it but it wasn't overwhelming - just refreshing! The patron Margarita was seriously on point, thus the need for 2!

We of course had the duck fat fries - the pastrami \"dusted\" fries & Russian dressing tasted exactly like a Ruben ~ So delicious!

We also had the duck confit, which sits atop a German potato salad with pickled mustard seeds (you need this in your life!). I do recommend that they should note it is made with bacon on the menu, though I ate around it and it was still amazing.

Everyone knows the steaks and sides are fantastic, we had the creamed spinach and soy glazed mushrooms. I was pretty sure I wouldn't be able to eat as much as I did given the tightness of my dress but it was so hard to throw in the towel!

Holly was our server and she was so perfect! She explains the specials professionally and has great recommendations without feeling like we were being pushed into anything. She visited the table just enough - I never searched the room for her, nor did I feel like she was interrupting our fun, in fact she was part of it! 

Loved it again and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a top notch spot. Great bar! Great service! Great food! What a great dinner experience! This is a steak to remember. The bar is stocked with a wide selection of tequila, which is my measure of any establishment. We all enjoyed the filet mignon. Wonderfully prepared. The sides accompanied perfectly. So what's keeping this place from 5 stars... I did wait in between courses. Maybe it's me... but I'm impatient. Bottom line. This is a fantastic venue. You can't go wrong! Best not not look at the prices, I don't, but perhaps bring a rich uncle to pay the tab. Any way you shake this is a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"We came here during a recent trip to Scottsdale.  It was a close call between this (something new) and Element (where we had been before and loved.)  We chose to do something new.  The entrance was dark and masculine.  The interior was masculine too, except not as dark as it needed to be.  You know that really high lighting that makes the room bright an unromantic, yet is so high is kinda blinds you from really seeing the things that are right in front of you?  That is the lighting here.  I am kind of a lighting fanatic, but I believe a dining experience should be pleasant to ALL the senses.  I noticed the tables on the patio, which looked like a better choice for ambience.

Our meal started with the amuse bouche of a french fry trio w/3 different dipping sauces.  I loves this non-pretentious approach.  Light hearted and fun.  We split a caesar salad, which was perfect on the portion size.  I had a Kobe filet and it was amazingly tender, I thought it could have used a little more seasoning.  More then the steak, I was really impressed with the mashed potatoes, which were the best I ever had.  You could certainly taste the butter and cream, but there was a textural thing going on that I couldn't quite figure out.  Almost like the potato was riced, then pureed with cream.  Anyway, I have never been so sad to leave something unfinished....but we were really full.

Service was just OK.  Several times I poured my own wine, which is kind of a bummer.  The restaurant was pretty empty at that point, so I guess our waiter was done.  We left without anyone acknowledging us."}
{"text":"Another great (hairless caramel) experience at Bourbon Steak.  The fries still rock, and I was happy to see an Iron Horse sparkler on the wine list by the glass.
I avoided the ahi tuna tartare because it's endangered yo and I'm trying to be responsible (though it smelled really good).  I split the olive oil poached halibut and a 10 oz steak with the lovely dining companion to my right.  They cut the portions in half and plated them beautifully for us.  The halibut wasn't as mind blowing as the dish I had at Dovetail in NY, but it was good.  The steak was lovely, and the sides, again, stole the show.  Truffled mac n cheese, potato cakes with cheese and bacon, broccolini and mushrooms.  Nom.
I made everyone split the beignets with me (with all three dipping sauces) and they were excellent.
Again, I'm glad I wasn't paying, but it was a solid meal with great service."}
{"text":"We can't comment on the dinner menu, entrees or food, but really liked the bar to start off the night.  Great cocktails, but if you are a Bloody Mary fan don't bother.  Great service, ambiance, atmosphere and bar food."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing from start to finish. The waitstaff here is incredible! They took time to stop by our table and talk to my brother who is in school for hospitality management. Impressive food, great wine and cocktails. Very expensive but not to be missed!"}
{"text":"I ate here this past weekend and it was one of the best meals I have had in a long time! The service was terrific and you can't beat the atmosphere.  We sat on the patio and it was a gorgeous night!  The restaurant is located inside the Fairmont Princess Hotel which is very beautiful.

We started with a Tuna Tar Tare appetizer and it was out of this world delicious.  For my entree I had Artic Char which is my favorite fish and my boyfriend had a Kansas City strip steak which he enjoyed as well.

The only reason I'm not giving this restaurant 5 stars is because it is definitely a little pricey.  Our dinner for 2 people was over $200.

That being said, I'm sure we will be back.  The food, service, and atmosphere were all terrific."}
{"text":"We came for a quick staycation on groupon - highly recommended.  I also found a travelzoo deal for half off tasting menu at Bourbon steak.  It was $125 for two (for a $250 tasting menu for 2) - great deal I thought.  The problem was the restaurant clearly just gave us a $125 tasting menu for two.  Small portions, cheap ingredients.  Two bites of bland tuna tartar, two cappuccino cups of melon soup (sadly the best course), two beet salads that had about four beet pieces on it, two small sad pieces of tuna, three thin slices of some sort of meat on cabbage(!) without any sides, and two chocolate desserts (not too bad). But the kicker is they automatically added 20%tip to ... $250 \"original price\"!!  With a bottle of tasty chupacabra wine ($54) add extra $129 to the bill.  Fail.  Avoid."}
{"text":"Might be the best $800 I've ever spent on myself. However, I did request to meet the Chef but was denied. Could've been because I was extremely intoxicated."}
{"text":"The other night I was craving a delicious steak dinner after a quick search I, thankfully, discovered Bourbon and Steak at the the Princess in Scottsdale. The food was great however the service is what will bring me back. Crystal was awesome at the bar. Made me feel at home while I was waiting for a table then Jeremy continued the experience with his  hospitable tableside manner. All over a fantastic time. Thanks all around!"}
{"text":"Over rated and over priced! Coming from the DC area - known for its steaks houses - this restaurant pales in comparison. With the $$$ you will part with, great food and service should be spot on - but sadly not here! This restaurant is on the property of the Scottsdale princess.  If you have a car I would recommend going to another steak restaurant - lots close by- the hotel also provides a car service for a nominal fee.  
Unfortunately, when we were there a table of parents and very small children were close by- one little one very fussy.  It did dampen the dinner and night out."}
{"text":"Went there with some out of town relatives over the Christmas break. We were looking for an \"upscale\" spot to celebrate the holidays. My wife and I have been huge fans of the Princess Resort for...well...decades, but had never been to Bourbon Steak. In short...WE WILL BE BACK...Now let's be honest...this place is a tad pricey, but the words \"worth it\" don't even begin to describe how perfect they made the experience. The food was as you'd expect...fabulous....and the little cream puffy desert wonders were gifts from the cosmos. But much more than that...it was the experience...a perfect location and a staff that was about as professional and attentive as I've ever experienced. A special shout out to our waiter Todd...who took pride in going the extra mile. This IS the perfect place for a special Scottsdale's occasion. I couldn't recommend it more highly!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Bourbon Steak for ages, and thought Restaurant Week might be a good time. But sadly, it was a disappointment, and I doubt that we will go back. There are too many other choices nearby that outshine them, like Mastro's. The farm salad was average (told no tomatoes available), the \"prime hanger steak\" was so chewy, my husband spit out the bite I shared with him. It was cooked to correct degree of doneness, however.  Tables were ultra close together so that the party of 2 businessmen sitting at a table next to us were close enough that they could have been our guests. Noisy and busy, even though our reservation was 5:30 pm on a week night.  It was hard to hear the explanation of the food, like the paring of the 3 kinds of fries with the 3 dipping sauces, or what was that puddle of sauce/potatoes under my steak.  Loud music blaring (Tom Petty, Bob Dylan) We had trouble getting our \"doggie bag\" that truly went to our dogs. Our server never came back, and we had to track down our busser. The complimentary french fries were good, and they gave complimentary little bags of caramel corn with the payment. But when I contrast the food and service with other Restaurant Week experiences, this falls short. Some places like Fleming's and Eddie V's became regular stops with us due to a very positive Restaurant Week experience. Bourbon Steak is a very casual place for one so pricey. Even the wait staff wears jeans. I would imagine that if you order off the regular menu, it would be at least $100 per person with tax/tip. Burgers in the bar are $18. Fleming's at DC Ranch offers a better one with better atmosphere for $6. Tonic in mixed drink was flat. Wine by the glass very pricey. Ladies Room needed attention. Used washcloths were not put in basket, toilet not flushed, no seat covers. Surprisingly dated rest room for place remodeled from the fabulous Masquesa just 6 years ago. Hope they do a better job on the remodel of The Grill."}
{"text":"Painfully slow service.  Weird music.  Ridiculous.
Has Michael Mina even been here?

Great if you're on an expense account and you have the whole evening."}
{"text":"Despite the hype, more often than not celebrity chef restaurants tend to disappoint, so I was prepared to add Michael Mina's Bourbon Steak to the list of  big-name letdowns, particularly since this is just one of four Bourbon Steak locations (San Francisco, Miami, and Detroit being the other cities).  Instead, I am giving an enthusiastic five stars and including it on my personal favorites list. 

Located in the lobby of the Fairmont Princess, the dark (I mean really dark) and sleek interior looks like it was lifted straight out of the Aria Las Vegas, which coincidentally is also home to another Michael Mina outpost, American Fish.  On display as you enter is an extensive and impressive collection of wine, much of it from small boutique wineries, all of it high quality, much of it very difficult to find. 

The dining room is quite elegant, with a soaring ceiling, softly lit.  This room is the definition of modern chic.  For whatever reason, a lot of these newer places have dispensed with tablecloths in favor of bare tables, which looks cheap to me, but overall it is a stunning, luxurious room.  

Having reviewed the wine list that afternoon, and after a nice chat with the sommelier, we had selected a couple of bottles for the evening.  As requested, a bottle of '07 Altamurra cabernet had been decanted prior to our arrival and was waiting table side. This is a stunning wine, and proved to be the perfect complement to our experience. Sadly, our second bottle, a 2002 Dal Forno Romano Valpolicella, was both expensive and disappointing.

The house favorite duck fat fries were served as an appetizer. While not the best fries I've ever had (for me, that distinction still goes to Danny's BBQ in Cary, NC), they were still quite tasty.  In addition, we also ordered the ahi sashimi, as well as a good (but not great) carpaccio. I would skip the carpaccio next time, but the ahi was superb. 

Dinner for me was the wagyu beef trio, which comes with three, 4oz cuts:  a NY strip, filet and flatiron. It also includes a side of horseradish whipped potatoes and creamed spinach. All three cuts were a perfect medium rare.  Of the three, surprisingly the flatiron was my favorite, incredibly flavorful and dense. I will be dreaming about this steak for quite some time. 

By the time dessert rolled around, there was not too much room left, but I pressed on and ordered the beignets with Macallan 18 butterscotch pudding. Whoa, these was some incredibly amazing, totally empty calories. They serve three beignets, but unless you want to risk a sugar coma, you may want to limit yourself to just one. 

Service was stellar, from start to finish. Friendly, attentive, and totally unobtrusive, they made the meal a nearly perfect experience.  

So, while I am still skeptical with regards to restaurants that have a marquee name over the door, in the instance Bourbon Steak proved worthy of the name Michael Mina."}
{"text":"Prime cut steak? Really?   This place needs a new meat supplier because this was the poorest \"prime\" steak I've ever had.  It was also over cooked. My son commented his steak looked like it was purchased from the local grocery store.  The Prawns were ok, the Mac and white cheese was not great.  The noodles were under cooked. 
Our waiter would disappear at times. He never checked on us once the meal was delivered. 
If you are a true steak connoisseur, I highly suggest you avoid Bourbon Steak. 
A friend who lives in Scottsdale warned me about this place, I wish I had listed to him"}
{"text":"The food is good but if your eating in the bar bring a fan - it is way to hot - there is no AC - pathetic"}
{"text":"A friend and I took advantage of the Travel Zoo deal for the 5 course chef's tasting menu. I was a little nervous after reading other Yelpers reviews of the deal and the service, but we were so pleasantly surprised! Everyone from the hosts to the variety of waiters, servers and the sommelier were very friendly and knowledgeable. A slight annoyance for trying to clear our courses very quickly (we were definitely taking our time and enjoying everything!). 
To our surprise, we actually had an 8 course meal, 9 if you count the sorbet! 
1. The chef sent duck fat french fries to all tables and they were so good. They were in three containers, each with it's own seasoning and sauce. 
2. an aronchini ball on a parmesan sauce. They used risotto and it had a lot of flavor. 
3. a little shooter of gazpacho that was so flavorful, tomato based, a little spicy with nice fruity olive oil sprinkled on top. They served it in a cute little cup that you could pick up and drink from.
4. Smoked salmon salad - this was my favorite course. House smoked salmon with cucumbers, summer squash on a tahini sauce. I know I'm missing some ingredients, but the flavors blended together so nicely, it was interesting in a good way.
5. Raviolo - a giant ravioli! They somehow managed to get an egg yolk into the filling, so that when you cut into the raviolo, the egg yolk ran out and became part of the sauce. 
6. Grilled calamari and mushrooms. This was my least favorite course, the texture of the calamari was strange, but it wasn't a bad dish, just not the best. 
7. Steak course - hangar steak with shishito peppers. soooo good. I don't remember what the sauce was on the plate, but there was a fresh garlic/herb oil on the steak too. Honestly, at this point, we were looking at each other like, how many courses are we going to get?!? they just kept coming. It was awesome. 
8. Dark chocolate peanut butter cream cake with peanut brittle and peanut butter powder. Amazing. We took two bites, but had to take the rest to go because we literally couldn't eat any more! 
We also had a bottle of wine from their summer recommendations. It was a pinot noir and was reasonably priced at $45.00. If you are a wine lover, they have a very extensive wine selection. They display them beautifully in their entryway too. 
Yes, this was an expensive meal, but it really was an event!!"}
{"text":"We chose Bourbon Steak for restaurant week and were sadly disappointed. We were seated in the bar not the actual restaurant as apparently they did not want to offend regular clientele with the servings. Several couples were  all seated together along a wall with the restaurant week menus. The server came and told us he recommended a Kobe steak, interesting, as it was the most expensive item. We were given a salad that honestly had 4 bites. The portions were small and the food was so average. Will never be back."}
{"text":"Chef Curtiss and his staff created the most amazing birthday dinner for my wife. I called Bourbon Steak and asked them to create a tasting menu that would be good for a pregnant lady who was allergic to tree nuts and crab. I also asked that they create mock-tails for her to drink along with every course that we would have. Not only where we able to enjoy an insanely good meal my wife got to feel so very special on her day.

I highly recommend Bourbon Steak."}
{"text":"The wife and I decided to hit up Bourbon Steak for Restaurant Week 2009.  We couldn't get in last year because we waited a little bit too long on the reservations so we were definitely anticipating our visit.  The first word of advice, if you don't plan on utilizing valet parking at the front of the resort, please be prepared to be confused where to park.  We saw at least three lots that were virtually empty but we weren't able to park there without a special code or room key.  

We arrived right on time for our 6:30p.m. reservation and were seating right away outside on the balcony.  It was nice out, a little humid, thought they might ask us if we'd like inside or outside...  One note about the seating outside...the tables are VERY close together, not only could I hear everything the couple next to us was talking about, anytime the server was helping them, his butt was a little too near our table.  

We were greeting by our waiter quickly, and he took our beverage orders, and explained how restaurant week worked.  Shortly after he left to give us some time, another employee came up with some duck fat fries, compliments of the house.  There were three different flavors with three different sauces.  The herb fries and truffle fries were enjoyed, the paprika ones, not as much.  Shortly after this, we were brought out a nice tasting focaccia bread.  Our waiter came back and we ordered our apps, entrees and dessert from the restaurant week menu, and also added an order of truffled mac n cheese from the regular menu.

I had the beef carpaccio, which was pretty tasty. One thing I did not like about it was that there was some random things on it, but I couldn't tell what it was, because by this time it was dusk and I couldn't see my plate real well.  The wife had the greens, which she liked.  For entrees, we both ordered the kobe flat iron & short ribs.  Both were flavorful, but I have to say the flat iron was better than the short ribs, only because the fatty flavor of the short ribs became a little overpowering after eating the whole thing.  The accompanying carrots and pasta were also quite tasty and I virtually cleaned my plate.  Next, out came the desserts, wife with the marscapone cheesecake and myself with the beignets w/ butterscotch sauce (or pot de creme for the foodies).   I had heard pretty good things about the beignets...I have to say I was just whelmed w/ them, they were fine.  Okay flavor.  I didn't particularly care for the sauce, I'd have preferred a little more butterscotch, this seemed more scotchy to me (but if you really like scotch, I bet you'll like the sauce).  The wife loved the cheesecake.  I was seriously surprised that she let me try some the way she was raving about it.  It was pretty good, I have to say.  You may be wondering though, 'how was the truffled mac n cheese'?  I'm still wondering the same thing!  They never brought it out.  It's no wonder, as it didn't make it to the receipt, so our waiter must have just spaced on it.  Probably for the best because we were stuffed after this delicious meal and I don't know where we would have put some mac n cheese.

I rate Bourbon Steak four stars.  The food was for the most part great.  The service was very attentive, with one blunder of a missed order.  The atmosphere was also very nice with the exception of the close quarters and poor lighting.  I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This is an excellent choice for dinner on the resort. My wife and I had a great dinner and the service was excellent. The steak for two was wonderful. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"I am catching up on reviews. However, the service here was by far the most excellent service in the Valley I have received thus far. Why only four stars? Well, it began most wonderfully with a trio of fries and sauces. We were there for Restaurant Week, which I suppose had a play in our experience....Service was impeccable from the beginning. We never wanted for water and each dish was nicely displayed and described. Then, the food. As foodies, I suppose we expected more. The egg appetizer was a hit, but the corn soup was good but not something I would talk about. At this point it was either the fries or the poached egg that were interesting and noteworthy. The main course arrived with our competent server and his entourage. The short ribs were nothing \"short\" of amazing."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for a romantic night out.  We had a culinary experience event coupon that had some confusion initially.  But Andrew the General Manager was over the top in making things right.  

From the appetizers to the main course to dessert - it was a culinary experience.  And we have eaten at some of the better places in Scottsdale.  I am unsure why there are some reviews that are mediocre because this place delivers.  Wonderful ambiance, great food and friendly staff.  Nice views over the golf course too.  You can't go wrong in  eating here."}
{"text":"First time visitor from Orange County California and man it was the best experience ever! From the cocktails to the recommendation our server Logan gave to us to even the details of the ambiance! For someone that works in the fine dining industry, i was beyond impressed to every detail there was at this restaurant. My family enjoyed it as well. Yes it's a bit pricey but you are paying for the overall experience of this place. Yes, yes, and yes!"}
{"text":"This was the second time I have eaten here on the annual boys trip.

As at all other Michael Mina places they start off with a sampler of fries with unique dipping sauces.  This is a nice start, especially since most steakhouses don't give you an amuse.

This time I got the duck raviolo and the skirt steak.  The raviolo was very good.  The egg yolk adds the richness to it to make the difference.  Could have used a bit more salt but it was still quite enjoyable.  The steak was cooked perfectly.  Skirt steaks have a nice amount of fat to them that there is no shortage of flavor.

Desserts here do not speak to me.  We shared a large order of beignets.  It came with 3 different dipping sauces.  This just ok.  They have the same dish at the other Mina restaurants I have been to.

Service was excellent.  We had a large party but they did a good job making sure our glasses stayed full and the pacing on food was pretty good.

Solid steakhouse that is not friendly on the wallet, but then again nothing is at the Fairmont Princess hotel."}
{"text":"When my GF and I go to Scottsdale we always have at least one \"fine dining\" experience. The last trip it was Bourbon Steak. There was no need to order an appetizer as they sent out the awesome fries: made in duck fat and three different spices along with dipping sauce. I had the A5 Japanese Kobe steak and my GF had the fried chicken. OK, my steak was melt in your mouth make me scream good. One of the top 3 steaks I have ever eaten. 

My GF wanted the chicken, but here is the catch: it is made for two because the whole chicken is fried in duck fat (once again). That was the only bummer, if you want the chicken and no one wants to share with you (hey, I came for the steak), you are stuck. But my other thought is: if you really want something, screw the cost, order it, and take the rest home with you. I had a thigh the next day and it was amazing. Along with the chicken you get a healthy portion of truffled mac and cheese with broccoli. It was pretty damn amazing--especially the gratuitous inclusion of the broccoli. Our server told us later that you can ask for more broc if you want--note to self. 

They also have a great wine selection. Since my GF offered to be the driver, I ordered a half bottle of my favorite pinot noir: Merry Edwards, and that just topped off the night.

Also, if you are not a fan of truffle oil (crazy, I know. I love the stuff), this is not the place for you. Other than that, we had a great dining experience. Service was great and timely. It would have been a 5 star review if the chicken somehow could have been a single serving. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had dinner with some coworkers here the other night and I was very impressed. It's at the Fairmont Princess which I had been to once before for an event, but I hadn't been on the site before otherwise. We arrived a few minutes before they opened and found a table in the bar. They were having issues with their sound system which was slightly disrupting (loud static), but the manager was very apologetic and they were quickly resolved. We first started with drinks and appetizers - trio of duck fat fries, tuna tartare, and the chicken wings. The duck fat fries were so good that we got a second order of them. I am not a lover of seafood, but I tried the tuna tartare and I didn't hate it, so that must be good for something. The KFC wings were really good! Had a great kick to them and were very big and meaty. 

We went back and forth between ordering off of the dinner menu or getting a burger, and the four of us decided on burgers and we all ended up getting the All-Beef. It was really good, but next time I would get it without the balsamic onions. With our burgers we shared side orders of the truffle mac and cheese and the grilled (roasted?) peppers. I would have easily eating the mac and cheese by myself, it was delicious. I can't find a description of the peppers, but I had never had them and they were also good. We took our time eating and drinking, our server was great and hung out to chat with us throughout the night. We ended with an order of beignets and the apple crisp. First time eating beignets and they were delicious. Get the butterscotch pudding dip, you won't be disappointed. They even brought out an extra (4) so that we would all have one to try. The apple crisp was also great."}
{"text":"I dined here last week with my wife and in-laws and, I gotta say, it doesn't get much better.  Ambiance was dark but classy.  Loved the music (no dated Rat Pack stuff here).  Started the evening with their amazing Trio of Duck Fat Fries.  The truffle emulsion may have been the best sauce I've ever had in my life!  Only got better from there: Shellfish tower was loaded with goodies and all tasted straight from the ocean!  For entrees, my wife got the Trio of Kobe Beef and I had the Fried Chicken for two.  One of the top meals I've ever had in my life.  The chicken was so moist an came with a truffle mac & cheese and onion jus.  I did say it was for two but it was so good that i refused to share.  My wife couldn't stop talking about the Kobe Trio.  

But, I gotta say, the best part of the experience was the staff.  Knowledgeable just isn't enough to describe the service here.  They care about every single detail, never missing one.  The Sommelier made excellent wine recommendations (and each one well within my price range) and never skipped a beat when it came to pouring for the table.  The server was as professional as professional gets and the Manager seemed to always be there to pull out a chair or provide a fresh napkin.  Flawless.

Well done Bourbon Steak!"}
{"text":"Ambience was fantastic! Eclectic dining, fire pit area was wonderful. Appetizers and drinks were priced fairly for 5-star hotel restaurant."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place, but as soon as they stopped making the amazing burgers, my husband and I stopped coming here. I can't even describe how much we loved Michael Mina's burgers... they were probably the best burgers I've ever tasted. When we found out they were taken off the menu, to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. Yeah, I know that restaurants change up their menus, but I thought this was one of the main attractions of this place. We enjoyed eating them in Bourbon's bar... it was always a highlight of our vacation, and we'd come more than once during any of our trips. 

We also dined in the restaurant portion before, and the steaks are what you would expect from a high end restaurant. The wagyu beef was especially wonderful."}
{"text":"Not cheap...but you will leave a better person!

Wow this place was great. My only gripe was with myself...really wish I'd come in hungrier!!

Instead of bread they start you off with a medley of fries and dips. Three different flavors (mesquite, truffle, and I forget the third) all with their one dipping sauce. All were phenomenal. 

I ordered the American Wagyu Carpaccio as a starter. The Wagyu was perfect. The greens were stellar. It was a bit spicy. Just amazing. 

Since I wasn't that hungry I only got the market oysters as my main course. It came with 5 huge oysters. Perfectly shucked and so fresh. The accompanying sauces were also delicious. 

My parents got the snapper. I tried a bite and it was also very good. Next time I'll be sure to come hungry enough for a steak!

The service was great. My glass of water never came close to empty. They were all attentive and very nice. One bus boy kept saying \"welc\" though instead of \"you're welcome\" which I found kind of funny. 

Love this place. My wallet hates it...but my stomach loves it!"}
{"text":"Been back to the bar for Happy Hour many times since the last review, and still the service, atmosphere and cocktails are the best - hands down.  Need to knock it down a star, though, because the Happy Hour food menu looks more like it belongs at Uncle Sam's than a Michael Mina Restaurant.  The Happy Hour food is executed as well as it could be, but let's face it, it's Fair Food. Like I said, best cocktails around, and I'll keep hoping to find more appropriate food on the Happy Hour menu next time."}
{"text":"The food was horrible. I ordered Crispy fork belly it came out super soft pork belly full of fat on it. The ambiance of the restaurant was very good but OMG you need to talk to your Chef and have them evaluate their menu."}
{"text":"This place is the classic example of a resort restaurant. You will be treated like a one-time customer.  We sat at the bar and ordered from the restaurant menu.  We are local diners who tried something new.  There are numerous other steak restaurants that offer much better service and superior quality food.  For example, Mastro's steakhouse, Ocean Club, Dominick's and even Outback Steakhouse would be better choices.  It took almost an hour for our entrees to arrive even though we ordered the daily \"special\".  We also didn't stick around for the last two courses because the delayed service was so painful.  The Spice Poached shrimp cocktail offered two medium shrimp on a huge plate for $22.  It was ridiculous.  Save yourself some grief and take a 5 minute cab to one of the many alternative places just outside of the resort grounds."}
{"text":"Not a typical hotel \"steak house\". Just had appetizers and cocktails in the bar... Could use a slightly larger selection (cater to the hotel crowd) but those we had were top-tier (lobster roll, sliders, fish n frites)."}
{"text":"Bourbon  Steak is located at the Fairmont Princess Hotel. . We sat outside on the patio and the setting was very nice. 

Tim was our waiter. He was attentive and very friendly. We ordered  oysters on the half shell, Caesar and Farmers salads, 16 oz rib eye to share, mushrooms and cauliflower as sides.   The meal was delightful and as expected. We ordered the Meyer lemon meringue and beignets for desserts. They were very good. 

Overall the dinner was good but what made the evening special was Tim and the wait staff!!"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner and superb service by our server Jeremy Mends. Our anniversary dinner couldn't have been any better, can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely thanksgiving dinner here with my family. The service, top notch. The atmosphere is absolutely the standard for both design and comfort. The food, was right to boot. I ordered the Lobster Pot Pie, which was although a little confusing as a dish; absolutely delicious. The butternut squash soup prior made my taste buds sing. I had never been here before so it was a very smooth and pleasant first visit. After dinner, we took our wine and toured the christmas lights throughout the resort which just topped it all off nicely. The outdoor bar and fire-pits were a nice spot to relax after a nice walk too. Will definately be back for more!"}
{"text":"Our evening there started off poorly due to an undesirable table and the complete ineptitude of the hostess. Once I made my feelings known to a manager, they responded well; however at this level of dinning these things just shouldn't happen in the first place. If our dinner blew us away, I would be more favorable, but it was just good - not great. Actually, not even close to great. Bottom line is you have MUCH MUCH better options for steak in Scottsdale at Modern Steak, or in Phoenix at Durant's. I would not return to Bourbon Steak."}
{"text":"My over all experience of this restaurant was one that was mediocre. Don't get me wrong they can cook a steak and the restaurant is beautiful. The service brings the experience up but would i go back? No. I worked at this resort and therfore knew what standards to expect when we came for a staycation. The resort, pools and bar were everything you would expect and more and they really did make 'moments into memories'. I know that there are other fantastic restaurants on property that i have repeatedly eaten at and will continue to frequent. Save your time and  money and skip Bourbon steak house."}
{"text":"Best. Burgers. Ever.      Really yummy, delicious burgers.     I'm a huge burger lover and this place has a great variety of burgers that always hit the spot.    The appearance of the restaurant is extremely appealing, the service is top-notch, and the food, burgers or otherwise, never disappoints, the appetizers are stellar and this place has probably the best Happy Hour in all of Scottsdale.     Comfy seating, nice scenery, great food, what more do you want?"}
{"text":"If I were rating Bourbon Steak on just the Lobster Pot Pie, it'd get 10 stars!  It may be the best dish that I've ever tasted.  I can't wait to go to a Michael Mina restaurant again just to eat the Lobster Pot Pie.

Being from Chicago, I have high expectations for a steak house.  Aside from the Lobster Pot Pie, the rest of our dishes were just so-so.  The Tuna Tartare sounded way more interesting than it actually tasted.  The Oysters were good, not great.  Service was awkward.

But the 10 stars for the Pot Pie more than compensate for the rest of the meal & service.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful steak house, though I always do love a Michael Mina restaurant. When staying at the Fairmont Princess in Scottsdale, I loved the smell of smoke that began to waft from the restaurant in the early afternoon (I forgot to ask what sort of wood they were using, it was really enchanting). The space was open, yet intimate and very well appointed. It makes the San Francisco outpost of Bourbon Steak look totally white trash. There were three distinct dining areas, a huge bar/lounge area, the main dining room and an expansive patio area with sweeping views and lovely fire features.

Both nights I was there I started with an amuse of three types of duck fat fries with three dipping sauces. Delish! The whiskey-based cocktails were innovative and delicious as well. The beef tartar was probably the best I have ever enjoyed. 

One night the service to start was horrible (we began in the lounge before our reservation in the restaurant) and the server was being a dick that I didn't want to order food with him. I finally just started to deal with the bartender instead, which pissed him off more. I alerted the manager via Twitter however and he was dealt with. Otherwise the service was incredible. 

Certainly consider this restaurant on your next trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I love Michael Mina, and I love steakhouses - independently of each other.  Mr. Mina's iteration of the classic steakhouse was superb. Cocktails, alone, occupy their own separate binder (awesome), and BS has the most comprehensive wine list that I encountered while in AZ.  I had the 10 oz filet, which was pretty close to perfect, asparagus and broccolini.  The most awesome part of the meal was, by far, dessert.  The beignets should win some kind of award.  Waitstaff was lovely, as well.  Only thing I hated, and didn't really understand? Decor of the main dining room....it's tragic and confused.

Bottom line: If you're in Scottsdale, you need to experience Bourbon Steak."}
{"text":"Fab.... 

HOLEY moley the cocktails in the bar are insane...

The bar menu is killer as is the happy hour. I love lamb, and I had the lamb burger which was fabulous. I had oysters which were sweet and oceany. I had more drinks, and more drinks and more drinks and was so impressed with the bartender (Christina's) skills at making unique cocktails.

The duck fat fries are rich... and I don't mean driving a Rolls Royce rich, I mean holy moley you will need to be rolled out of there in a wheelbarrow.

I cannot stress enough just how awesome the bar is.

I have eaten in the main dining room too, and while I enjoyed the service it just felt somewhat more sterile and less fun... it was intimate, which is great if you are taking a date... but if you are on your own you better sit yer tush on the stool and order up a Pink Panther.

A+++ for Michael Minnas only AZ spot."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE a good steakhouse. We originally planned to dine at Ironwood Kitchen, but the service was terrible! Waited almost 20 minutes with just water in our cups...no server in sight (mind you, too, we made a reservation). So instead, we headed over to Bourbon Steakhouse (which we've been wanting to try), and asked if they could squeeze us in. They had room at the bar which ended up being just as good as the floor dining. We had a booth all to ourselves and LOVED the ambience and service especially. They gave us a sampler of their potato fries and sauces for free, being first time customers...5 stars for that!

3 stars goes to Bourbon Steakhouse food for the following:

My husband is a filet epicurist and loves a good, minimalist approach to a rare - cooked steak. He was bummed to find out that they only offered an 8oz portion, which he could easily eat two of. And at the price of $50, it wasn't worth the size. His sides were a baked potato and a shrimp cocktail. Only two prawns for the appetizer at $30 (not nearly worth that price). His potato was good - portioned, but he had to dress and mash it to his liking, which got a little messy. He said his filet was good, but not great. He preferred Eddie V's filet.

I ordered Mushroom soup and a wedge salad. Blue cheese (which I love), was a little heavy on my salad, though the pickled onions on it were terrific. Mushroom soup was good, but have had other soup appetizers better other places.

To average out food and service, a good 4 stars is deserved. Would go again, but it might be a while...
We're glad to say we've tried it!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were amazing and Todds was right about the ox tale  lfried rice was amazing! The whole staff was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding. We ordered off the southwestern part of the menu, don't recommend that stay with the classics. Duck fat fries were great with the dipping sauces. Loved the foie gras sliders."}
{"text":"Full review blogged:

Trio of Duck Fat Fries including Smoked Paprika-BBQ Sauce, Pepper Dusted-Rosted Garlic Aioli, and Fine Herbs-Onion Ketchup:  Known in the past for his 'trios,' at his San Francisco Flagship the meal at The Princess started the same as that at MGM Detroit with a trio of perfect French fries each dusted with a signature spice blend and matched to a complimentary condiment.  Crunchy on the exterior and just a bit toothsome within I'm still not exactly sure that I'm 'sold' on the way so many chef's flaunt the use of duck fat for fries but all things being equal these were really good, particularly the fine herbs interpretation.

Foie Gras Duo with Roasted Bing Cherries and Almond Streusel:  While I generally eschew the restaurant week menu it was the non-RW appetizer that would prove to be the biggest failure of the meal and, perhaps, the biggest food failure I've had since moving to the valley - simply stated, this was a piece of foie that should have never made it to the kitchen let alone to the table.  Undersized, overcooked, poorly cleaned, and still somehow lukewarm on arrival there was really nothing to like about the seared portion of liver aside from the cherries - and least of all the veins and sinew zigzagging the palate.  Moving on to the second half of the duo a creamy terrine beneath cherry gel was presented and paired with buttery brioche it was nearly good enough to save the plate - but not quite, particularly as Christina's response to our complaint was simply taking the dish off of our bill rather than suggesting the chef take a second try with a better piece of foie gras and more attention to detail.

Caramelized Black Mission Figs- Spicy Sopressata, Preserved Lemon Ricotta:  Rather horrified by the liver I was heartened by the first choice from the restaurant week menu; a sort of composed cheese plate featuring the intense fructose of fresh figs matched up against the bite of sopressata and lightly fragranced ricotta.  Like most Bay Area chefs I'd suggest that if a Mina restaurant is offering up a fig dish you'd be wise to order it.

Crispy Sonoma Duck Breast- Cipollini & Brussel Sprout Hash, Huckleberry Compote:  One of three RW main courses and for my dollar the most obvious choice by a landslide the kitchen was gracious enough to serve us each a separate portion of the Sonoma margret and while I cannot say it soared to the same levels as Chef DeRuvo's version at Davanti Enoteca a few weeks prior this was another excellent preparation of my favorite protein with the aged fowl's slight must perfectly tempered by the pungent hash and sweet berry reduction.  Easily cut with the edge of a fork despite being served with one of the restaurant's signature steak knives and as tender as you could hope I'm still having trouble getting over the fact that I now live in a city where good duck exists at not just one but multiple restaurants.

Whole Fried Chicken for Two with Truffled Mac & Cheese:  Yes it is $58 for chicken, but compared to the $200 Bresse at Savoy or the $78 version at The Nomad I guess you could call this brined, battered, and duck fat fried version a bargain if it was nearly as good as the others...and thankfully it was.  Featuring a plump hen with breading so dainty that it approximated the thickness of skin the bird was carved tableside and laid on a bed of truffled macaroni and cheese plus baby carrots before being topped with crispy onion rings and with each of the accoutrements quite delicious none were as good as the chicken itself - dense, moist, full of flavor, and complimented by rather than being overwhelmed by the seasoned breading.

Bourbon Bar- Dark Chocolate, Peanut Butter, Pretzel:  Seeing as how my writing is impossibly behind at this point suffice it to say I'd already experienced this dish at Baltimore's Wit & Wisdom and I was glad to revisit it as the alternate RW dessert.  Described loosely as the chef's interpretation of a candy bar this dessert beings with a core of sweetened peanut butter mousse and dresses it with dense 70% dark chocolate ganache before bespeckling it with crumbled nougat, peanuts, and finally chocolate covered pretzels.

Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Icing, Crème Fraiche Sorbet:  With Mr. Mathias stopping by to check in a conversation about Mina et al's approach to pastry ensued and after mentioning my fondness for his unique interpretations of American comfort foods we found ourselves gifted this one last plate.  Beginning at its base with airy spice cake flecked with carrots and studded with currants atop a smear of whipped cream cheese this dessert, much like the panna cotta, was taken to a whole different level through the addition of two frozen quenelles, one tangy crème fraiche and the other strikingly vegetal carrots.  Bite for bite the most delicious and complicated of the evening's three desserts this was just another exam  how Chef Mina understands the powerful effect of American comfort food."}
{"text":"Did not feel this was worth the price. $12 martini came with the smallest olives I've ever seen!  Steaks ok but for $55. They should be great. I feel Mastro's has better meat and much better ambience. Tonto Verde Clubhouse has better steak for half the price. Service was very slow. Nicest touch was a complimentary starter, duckfat French fries with different sauces. We went to take in the Christmas extravaganza and that was great."}
{"text":"I have gone back to bourbon every time I have gone to Scottsdale. I brag all the time about how great it is, until this last time. 

I talked a friend into getting the wagyu beef by the ounce. She did not want to pay for it but I assured her that it was worth every penny. The waiter recommended the wagyu strip which was different than what I had last time. We ordered it medium rare and he said the chef recommends medium. I never, ever get any meat at medium but I always take a chef's recommendation. It was not good. I ended up paying for my friend's portion because it was not up to par. 

I notified the manager and they really didn't do anything. I should have sent it back while I was there but I just hate doing that. In the least they should have offered my money back. I will not go there again."}
{"text":"Very good steakhouse.  The lobster pot pie is different... and very tasty.  Service is prompt and not at all pretentious.  Better than Dominicks... different than Mastros.  Definitely a good choice for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I love steak and I love steakhouses. I also expect incredible service for the prices you pay at a restaurant like Bourbon. First the good news....the food was delicious. Mikey, who was not our server, but the servers assistant was absolutely terrific and truly knows the definition of 'customer service' - he knows his product and knows what a customer expects from a restaurant of this caliber and is proud and happy to share his thoughts, knowledge and special touch. 

Amanda, who was also not our server, also picked up where our server fell short again. 

Our server was missing in action for most of the evening and had it not been for Mikey and Amanda we would still be waiting for our order to be taken. 

While the food was good, we were so preoccupied with the poor service of our waiter, it really ruined the whole experience. 

I just don't get it, how can you command these prices and not back it up with excellent service. We literally had to go to the hostess stand three times to find our waiter. 

The restaurant is beautiful but service leaves a lot to be desired. 

I hesitate even giving it three stars but Mikey, Amanda and the food made up for the failure of others."}
{"text":"A Michael Mina Classic. I have wanted to try a Mina restaurant for a long time and thanks to friends Bil and Lorita I got my chance last week. All I can say is this..duck fat fried french fries with white truffle dipping sauce, warm rosemary and truffle bread, fillet mignon, awesome Pinot and great service. The menu even included a variety of specialty steaks including Kobe Fillet Mignon $175. We had a great time the decor and service rocked. Great place for business or romantic dinner"}
{"text":"Didn't know Arizona food scene had come this far!  Wow!  Literally - an Oasis in the Dessert!  Get the side of mushrooms and the pink drink with basil and raspberry's!  Ohhhhh and that Flip Nog - wow!  The manager came out and made us feel like a million bucks!  My sweet Aunt loved the Ahi Tuna Tartare and the GM Andrew was kind enough to let her know she can text her with the code \"Tuna Date\" and she can come in for her Tuna at the bar.  The Michael Mina hospitality is really coming through here and Scottsdale is lucky to have the King of Hospitality make his castle be the Princess!  Thanks to server Kenny who was knowledgeable and also makes a mean cocktail."}
{"text":"Terrible! Today was my 40th birthday and we went to Bourbon's steakhouse and it was HORRIBLE!!! The service was some of the worst service I have ever experienced, they were mostly dumb teenagers who did not know the menu. We had to ask the staff to clear the table as they just kept walking by and wouldn't remove the empty plates. The food was downright awful, we had the octopus and it was absolutely disgusting, the kanpachi appetizer was mediocre at best and the steaks were tough and chewy. My mom got the bone in ribeye and literally could not cut through it with a steak knife it was so tough and such a bad piece of meat she sent it back and did not request another steak. There were 7 of us and the bill was $900 and it was such a disappointment."}
{"text":"It's no Kai but it is excellent food and if you get the happy hour, a great value.

The Somm here THOMAS is excellent. Great guy who really knows his stuff.

The steak was outstanding, we recommend the Flatiron. The Ribeye left us a bit flat.

All in all, a good experience for 4 star dining. Probably wouldn't repeat for anything other than Happy Hour foods and an excellent wine selection."}
{"text":"I had a fabulous dinner here at Bourbon Steak. They bring out French fries w dipping sauce instead of bread for the table. Yum! We split a bone in ribeye, salad and dessert. All was wonderful! Also the wine list has a lot of options. The wine is marked up a lot and I had wished there was a more reasonable Bordeaux BUT I ended up w a great Italian wine. This was our splurge dinner and it delivered. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is we thought service could have been better. It wasn't bad but to get 5 stars it needed to be a notch above! 
Also next time we will sit outside- they have a cool outdoor area"}
{"text":"One of the most remarkable dining experiences in recent memory...Superb food, exquisite presentation coupled with warm, kind and attentive service.

1) Crispy French fries to start with and their trio of sauces

2) Duo of salads...heirlom tomatoes, fried tomatoes, even a quail egg, crispy pancetta, bib lettuce...perfect way to start the meal and stunningly presented.

3) Organic filet mignon...cooked to perfection served with scrumptious sides (mushrooms, mashed potatoes so deliciously creamy you need a straw to enjoy them, and sauteed mushrooms)

3) Dessert - so mind boggling delicious...I quizzed my taste buds and they couldn't even remember what I ate...Chocolate custard with red velvet brownies...ooooohh boy...the server noticed how much I enjoyed it and even offered to bring me an extra one...how sweet is that ?Of course I said yes....2 hours of cardio for me today ah ah!

The service received was beyong impeccable and all of that without being intrusive. Considering how many restaurants Chef Michael Mina has, I am very impressed at how well his individual restaurants are run.

They even offered a tour of the kitchen...oh my ! I was in heaven...no restaurant even does that any more."}
{"text":"This review has been sitting incomplete for a couple months... Finally getting around to finishing it. 

Bourbon Steak is the type of place you go for a dining experience. Bf and I went for restaurant week and probably enjoyed it that much more because of the great price. We sat at the bar while waiting for a table and enjoyed a couple drinks. The drink menu had a lot of classic, masculine-type drinks. My bf, who knows his wine, commented that the wine list seemed really marked up. 

The restaurant has a cool decor and excellent service! We were brought a sampler of different flavored fries and dips which were so good (I have a weakness for french fries). All the other food we ordered (soup, fish, dessert) was definitely above par. My boyfriend said his flat-iron kobe steak was good, but not the most outstanding steak he's had. 

Overall, I'd recommend Bourbon Steak for a special occasion or to enjoy restaurant week/summer specials."}
{"text":"Not sure why Bourbon Steak is getting less than 4 star reviews. Their service was impeccable, everything that our party of 6 ordered was prepared with the best execution. 
Having been to other Michael Mina Restaurants in CA, their prices here were slightly lower in comparison, yet the experience was still delivered at the same consistently high level. 

We all ordered some type of steak, filet or ribeye, each with their own aging or grade that offers a unique experience. A definite highlight of the meal has to be their prawns, those things are huge and are true knife & fork size prawns that come both as a prawn cocktail or as a grilled add-on to a steak.  

Bourbon Steak is one more fantastic reason that the Fairmont Princess is one of my favorite places to be."}
{"text":"Bourbon Steak gets 5 stars for atmosphere.  Beautiful restaurant, really attentive and friendly servers. Classic but creative menu. I had the filet and a baked potato. They were both great, although a little overpriced ultimately for what they were. I don't mind paying a lot for food that makes me weak in the knees, but I didn't quite get there. I probably won't go back just because there are other places to get steak that I love more, but I would definitely recommend folks try this place, as there are probably other delicious menu items that I am too picky to try. Too bad I can't do a 3.5!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Bourbon Steak twice now and both times have been incredible.  The food is unique and creative and the service is impeccable.  

We have made sure to order different appetizers each time we've gone in order to experience a wide range from the menu.  Everything we have ordered has been amazing but, this last time, there was a definite standout.

The Local Goose Egg:  Our server explained that the chef is friends with a local farmer who sells his goose eggs to Bourbon Steak.  The egg is whipped with cream fresh and served with black trumpet mushrooms, English peas, and buttered country bread.  The egg isn't quite scrambled (like I said, it's whipped) but it isn't runny.  It's just soft and fluffy and, I would venture to say, only a little more viscous than a soup.

We have each ordered the New York Strip both times that we've gone and it has been perfect both times.  It's cooked just right and nice and salty with every bite.  I considered order the Prime Lamb Tasting this past visit, but couldn't pull myself away from the New York Strip.

They do offer the standard USDA cuts as well as two Wagyu selections from Snake River Farms in Colorado and one Australian Wagyu at Market Price.  Two of those have the very high price tag you would expect, but they 10 oz. Flat Iron Wagyu steak is priced at $49 which is just a few dollars over the New York Strip and seems very reasonable.

For dessert, we  ordered the Bourbon Bar which has dark chocolate, peanut butter, and pretzels (can't go wrong with that combination), and the Beignets.  The beignets need a special note because the menu offers the choice of \"Tongan Vanilla Crème Brulèe, Macallan 18 Year Butterscotch Pudding, or Valrhona Dark Chocolate Pot de Crème.\"  If you were going to make a decision between those three, I would suggest the Macallan 18 Year Butterscotch Pudding, but you can actually have all three of them brought out as a trio.  This would be my recommendation.  Why limit yourself to one dessert when you can have three?

Bourbon Steak has been the highest quality restaurant I've been to since moving back to Arizona from Las Vegas a year ago; they are definitely on par with the highly rated restaurants on the Strip.  Which, since moving back, I have found it difficult to discover quality and service that match what I became accustomed to as \"normal\", but Bourbon Steak does."}
{"text":"Good food and energetic ambiance. Rather inflexible menu, but attentive staff and a trendy feel. 

I'm not sure that it's truly one of the best steakhouses in the valley, but it is a good place to try a variety of american and wagyu beef."}
{"text":"Fancy steaks for a special occasion. My family party of 12 went for dinner around 6:00pm and the restaurant was about half full. There are outdoor heat lamps and patio seating, as well as plenty of separate dining rooms; we were seated at a long table in one such room. There was no table decor (tablecloths, candles, centerpieces, or place settings); for an upscale dining experience, this stripped-down seating felt casual. We ordered around 6:30 pm but our entrees were not served for another hour and twenty minutes. Disappointingly, we did not receive any updates on the order status. I recommend ordering 1-2 passed appetizers to occupy your time. Some of us began with the Caesar salad ($17), which was light and quite ordinary. The chicken ($35), fish ($43-$45) and steak ($55 for an 8 oz filet - $185 for a 40 oz porterhouse) are plated simply, but you also need to order additional sauces ($9-$32) and side dishes ($12-$22). The sides can be shared, but by no more than 4 people. You can see how your bill can skyrocket very quickly. Even the kids menu is pricey. Overall, the sticker price can't be justified unless you are a corporate exec expensing to the company card. The food is tasty, but I wish the dining experience had been more memorable."}
{"text":"Eghhhhhhhh. It's a Michael Mina restaurant that can be hit or miss on service but the food is fantastic if you're willing to pay a pretty penny.

Ambiance is on point and great for a nice fancy dinner. Very comfortable seating indoors and outdoors as well.
My favorite thing to do is sit out by the fireplace in fall for happy hour drinks and some appetizers. It's somewhat \"family seating\" outside so sometimes you meet some chatty out-of-towners to take to, which is always a blast for me. Spreading my yelpiness to people new in the area looking for places to try or things to do. 

Their happy hour is from 5-close if you sit fireside, and you can get a $5 dollar glass of wine or beer which I think is very reasonable. If you haven't been here for dinner yet and want to kind of check it out before committing to a fancy 175 dollar dinner, I would suggest coming at this time. 

GREAT food on the menu:
Lobster pot pie- it's rather large. So I would suggest splitting it. It's rich in flavor and amazing on a cold night.
The tuna tartar is AHMAZING if you're a seafood fan and looking for a light and fresh appetizer.
Duck fat fries are addicting, but very filling. 
OBVIOUSLY if you haven't tried the butter poached steak you're missing out on life. 

In regards to the bar-side: they barrel age their own fireball whiskey, which is quite good and definitely something I suggest indulging in if you're a whiskey drinker.

I'll keep this place on my birthday/anniversary/holiday dinner list."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic dining experience. Our server Logan, was excellent. He gave us a thorough run down of the menu, and recommended the tuna tartare which was amazing! Our steaks were cooked perfectly. They had a special for a side and Logan checked in the back to make sure it was still available, then offered us the last portion of it. It was incredible as well and it was an overall five star evening. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great, great place!  We had great food, great wine, great service, ambiance was fantastic...everything you'd expect from this caliber restaurant. If only I made more money, so I could eat here more often..."}
{"text":"We dined at Bourbon Steak for our anniversary.  The prices seem to be a little steep when comparing to other similar restaurants, but the service was spectacular.

I didn't enjoy the set-up of the restaurant though.....all tables, and pretty small.  I wasn't comfortable...and comfort is huge.  The steaks were cooked perfectly to how we ordered them...and they melted in our mouth.  Our favorite part of the dining experience.  The mashed potatoes were a great side choice....deliciously creamy.  The macaroni gratin, however, was not as good.  It lacked flavor...otherwise it would have been great.  My pomegranite martini was my least favorite part about my experience there.  It was just a decent cocktail....nothing notable in flavors or taste.

Overall....we had a wonderful time there, but most likely won't return, because there are so many options these days and there wasn't anything memorable enough to return."}
{"text":"The most exceptional dinner I've had. Our server Tod was a treat and the food was amazing. Certainly an expensive spot but you definitely get what you pay for. Five stars all around"}
{"text":"Bourbon Steak house was a fantastic experience for us. I was able to take my bride and our daughter here at the end of our stay in Scottsdale. Food was great, the service was outstanding. A very classy menu and staff. 
The food was a wonderful experience in taste and texture.."}
{"text":"This meal was the biggest disappointment of our Scottsdale trip.  When we have a series of evening meals (which is typical), I usually try to reserve one night for a good steak.  Bourbon was my best opportunity, given that we were staying at the Princess.  Salads were quite good.  My appetizer of mini grilled cheese sandwiches disappointed -- seemed to be slightly-toasted Wonder Bread, and quite yawn-inducing.  Granted, my better half is a master at grilled sandwiches, so maybe I'm a bit spoiled here.  The accompanying butternut squash soup was quite nice, though the temperature was a  bit cool for my taste.  The duck fat fries were definitely delicious.

As for main course, my filet totally fell short -- it was dry, seemingly overcooked (I ordered chef's preference), and relatively flavorless.  Others in our party expressed the same opinions.  Dessert was so-so -- my chocolate custard was somehow rich, yet not satisfying in an empty-calorie sort of way.  Hard to explain, but...it is what it is.

Take this review for what it is, given that it's based off a single meal, but I would head elsewhere for a steak fix.  If I had a chance to eat here again and had a similar meal, I would drop this to two stars, given the prices you are paying.  Hoping they had a bad night..."}
{"text":"Great Service.  Everything I had was good.  Steak was great!  Sides (asparagus, truffled mac and cheese)were awesome."}
{"text":"Bourbon Steak is an excellent restaurant. Yes it's on expensive but that's to be expected. The only thing I had a problem with was the service 2 out of the 4 times I have been there. They need to have better management in my opinion. They have many unique foods and appetizers. Just give them a try and I'm sure you will not be disappointed. At least with the food. LOL.."}
{"text":"We finally went this weekend and when my boyfriend asked if I'd come back my first thought was- \"Nah, I'd rather go to Flemings.\" Our first disappointed was the choices of wine by the glass. Seriously? Nothing under $16.00? Being in the booze industry it's annoying to see such a GYNORMOUS markup. Just greedy in my opinion. The service was great. Food- mediocre. I'm not a fan of the dinner plate as artwork. A smear of sauce here and there and little drops of veggies is old. The flavors weren't knocking me out either. They didn't seem to compliment the meat (chicken and scallops) or the other ingredients. Desert was disappointing too. Something butterscotch which sounded yummy but it had booze in it and I'm not a fan of the boozey sweets. Overall not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"I need to preface that I only ate in the bar with my 6yr old.

How does a place like this stay in business with the deep recession we're in?!!?!?!?!?!?!?

It is crazy expensive.

I imagine that that cuts of meat are probably outstanding.  I however will pass on the $150.00 16oz NY strip of wagyu until the whole 10% national unemployment trend blows over.

Good grief! Phoenix is close to being at the epicenter of the loan foreclosure mess and yet they still have a completely a la carte menu.  If you want a vegetable with that Wagyu...it's another $8 bucks...oh a starch too?  ...another $8.00.

My little one and I had:

1 Shirley Temple
1 Beer
2 diet cokes
1 Calamari
1 kids mini burgers
1 Burger ($14 bucks + $5 more if you want fries)

It was almost $70 dollars!!!!!!!!!

The waiter charged me $4 dollars for each of two diet sodas.  $8 dollars for two sodas.  Lord in heaven!

I get it. Go to McDonald's if you want a value meal right? I see that.

The food is good. It's well prepared and presented.

My only point is that I'm surprised that a menu strategy with those price points can survive in the new economy in places like Phoenix!

And, I don't care if I'm at Lutece...you don't charge for soda re-fills especially if they're $4.00 a pop!!!!  That's clearly an overzealous waiter trying to pump up the bill."}
{"text":"The 5 stars is for the bar.  The bartender here is awesome.  Its cool they serve the entire menu at the bar and service some good cocktails. One of my new favorite places to eat in Scottsdale.  I'll be back the next time I am in town.  I can't stop thinking about the salmon burger. nom nom"}
{"text":"Very pricey (even with Travelzoo vouchers...), but the food is incredible.  Definitely a special treat, great for events, romantic dinners."}
{"text":"Just got back from the Fairmont Scottsdale, spent three nights there and ate at the Bourbon Steak all three nights.  Let's get to it:

Day 1: Plane touches down at 6:30 p.m.   The wife tells me there is some sort of happy hour half-price deal so we need to get on the foot to get there quick.  Somewhere en route I get out of her that's it's just half price cocktails with purchase of a hamburger but hey, that's still a deal.  We get to the hotel a little after 7 and send the bags to the room to head to Bourbon straightaway.  Sat at the bar and had a really good hamburger.  The fries are $5 on the bar menu but are well worth it, mmm...fat.  I have two Rogue Dead Guy ales and....hey what's the alcohol content on those? Wait, I have the internet, I'll look it up....I'm being told it's 6.5% which explains the quickly ensuing buzz...also got the red onion rings which were beautifully stacked and all perfectly coated with goodness.  Winner.

Day 2: The wife has never seen the Grand Canyon so we take a 13 hour van trip through Sedona and the park.  The canyon remains impressive.  Get back to the hotel at 8:30'ish and decide to forego any more car time and go back to Bourbon, again in the bar, this time at a table.  Feeling like I'm on dangerous ground from a culinary-responsibility angle I have the salmon-burger 'banh-mi' style.  My request for 'as rare as they will make it' is heeded with remarkable sincerity and the fish comes out virtually raw which is fine by me.  A repeat of the fries and the onion rings.  Feel guilty about it until the first bite at which point I feel awesome about it.  Two more of those Rogue's now knowing full well the likely effect.  Tonight the service is spotty bordering on lousy and the two tables next to us almost riot.

Day 3: All day at the pool (4th of July!).  My pool bar tab: 12 Coronas at 6 bucks per and two hot dogs at a felonious 9 apiece, an even 90 (and my mother's heart sinks somewhere for a reason she can't put her finger on).  Tonight we have an actual reservation so we go back again, this time for a full dinner.  Echoing many other reviews, the lighting in the dining room is atrocious and, for some reaon, there are a ton of people sitting down to dinner at 9:30 with their mo-fo 10 year olds.  Strange, and also lame.  There are, however, a couple good booths in the bar which are not floodlit, to one of these we decamp.  The wife tells the wait person about the previous night's crappy service which she (the wait person) takes to heart as the service was an A+.  Tonight, ordering off the dinenr menu, the fries are free (word).  The soft-shelled crab tempura, ahi-poke, wedge salad, hanger steak, and marrow bones are not.  They split both the steak and the salad for us very nicely which was a nice touch.  The meal was delicious.  I like the food here.  I tell the server, \"the food is really rich here\".

Day 4: I was on the treadmill for five miles watching the Wimbledon final and was really sweaty and thought I smelled duck fat but that might have been my imagination.  Anyhoo, as I write this I now remember I took one of the after-dinner caramels back to our room and packed it in my suitcase which I unpacked this morning (but missed the side pocket) so there's a caramel in the luggage closet.  I will forget this by 7 p.m. tonight and will therefore discover this caramel near Labor Day when I next likely need that duffell.  Alas, I digress."}
{"text":"We generally like Michael Mina restaurants, but Bourbon at the Fairmont Princess in Scottsdale was not a favorite.  The bill came to over $800 for four people, so we were not looking for a deal - we wanted to eat and drink well!The $98 Wagyu beef fillet was ok, but I really regret paying so much for it (see the photo). The beet salad was good, apparently. 

That aside, service was awfully slow and we were unable to get anyone's attention without getting up to flag down a waiter.  Michael Mina - we sat with empty glasses most of the time - if your waiters were on the ball, the up-sell profits could have been through the roof."}
{"text":"Havng been to other Michael Mina establishments, (lame Clock Bar in San Francisco), my husband and I decided to try Bourbon Steak in Scottsdale (at the Fairmont Hotel). What a difference a city makes is all I will say! THis place had incredible management, an amazing staff, and outstanding food. The best steak house I have EVER been to all around. Here's to hoping their reputation, in my books, keeps their stamina from our last vsit!"}
{"text":"Michael Mina's Scottsdale enterprise, order anything and you will be pleased.  The tuna, salmon, snapper, and steak are amazing.  The creamed corn side dish, is no ordinary creamed corn, and is not creamed at all.  The beignets come with Tongan vanilla crème brulée, Macallan 18 year butterscotch pudding and Valrhona dark chocolate pot de crème - unbelievable."}
{"text":"We have been fortunate to have visited several of MM's restaurants and we looked forward to this visit as well last Saturday night. We purchased the half off coupon from Travel Zoo for the tasting menu. It's the only way to go. Prices here are very high. The food was outstanding. Each dish was expertly prepared and presented beautifully. Sometimes tasting menus get a bad rap for portion size. We felt that the portions were actually quite large for this tasting menu. 

The service here was truly a \"team\" effort, where we were taken care of by seemingly every service person in the place. They all did an excellent job! 

The only reason for not giving it 5 stars, was the noise level. It was loud and we were seated next to a large party and our table unfortunately became an area for people to stand right over my shoulder and have an off color conversation.     

Net-Net -- If you're looking for a terrific food experience here at Bourbon Steak, get the Travel Zoo coupon."}
{"text":"My friend and I had been traveling all day long and once we finally got to the hotel the restaurant was closing in 3 min.  Thankfully they let us in!  Because it was so late we didn't want a big steak.  We decided on their burger.  It was amazing!  The French fries were also to die for.  I would imagine that their steaks would be to die for if they can make such a great burger!"}
{"text":"Our Party of four had dinner here on December 25th, 2017. We ordered a lovely bottle of Clerico Nebbiolo which three had.  I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio.
For appetizers one had soup, one had Xmas wedge; and sadly TWO of us had Ahi Tuna Tartare.  It was NOT FRESH; and for two days two of us were very sick.  When I called Rachael she said we buy best seafood? (Maybe they might have  forgotten to put it  in Fridge?) No offer to refund the $30.00 BAD TUNA!!
Three had Steak Filet.  It was good; and one had Prime Rib which was OK.
For dessert we had Xmas Pecan, Xmas cheese, and xmas banana.
Our waiter Michael and his staff did a good  job providing us excellent service with vegetable, etc.

My advice if you want a steak with Ahi Tuna appetizer, I suggust Maestros Steakhouse!

Sincerely,

Ed Altman, Jr"}
