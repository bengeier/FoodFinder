{"text":"Love the ambience. What a hidden treasure! Family oriented restaurant. Had the buffet brunch on the weekend, everyone had what they liked - waffles, omelettes from the omelette station, fresh orange juice, bacon, sausages, etc. Plus they take reservations and the service is EXCELLENT! Adults $16.95+HST, Kids $10.95+HST"}
{"text":"Food was so so and service could have been much better...prices are outrageous for the portion and quality...would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I like Muddy Duck's atmosphere a lot. You have a verity of good options for your breakfast buffet  with a good quality + fresh orange juice. The service is great. However, I think the price for the buffet is a little bit high (16.99 before tax)"}
{"text":"We went here for a late lunch on a weekday. Upon walking inside, we were hit with a musty stench. It felt dusty and smelled like an old stuffy basement. We were seated in the solarium. The interior was old and dated.  We both ordered a soup and one of the daily specials; the chicken souvlaki with rice, potatoes, and Greek salad.  The French onion soup was tasteless with stale croutons that  had a freezer burn after taste. The potato leek soup was salty and tasted like something out of a can.   The plates came out ridiculously hot (everything was probably microwaved?) The potatos were dry and flaky and the rice was tasteless. The chicken slouvaki skewer was also bland and overcooked. It tasted like the  ones you'd buy from the grocery store.  I thought the salad was okay, until my girlfriend found a small bug in her salad.   We came here because the place always seemed busy on weekends, I guess the breakfast buffet is better quality because everything we tried off the menu today was horrid."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. I had Eggs Benedict with fried $10.95 Food is good service is excellent! They have a lot of regular customer.  Next time I want to try for brunch."}
{"text":"Too.... homely...  Good service yes... but the dishes were too plain.  I guess vote is more of a 2.5/5 stars"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to the Duck since about 1980 or so. It's obviously our local \"go to\" place and when home are there most Friday evenings. A warm thank you to all the staff for these many years of good service and food and always making us feel like we are part of the Muddy Duck family."}
{"text":"One of the best brunches in the GTA, reasonably priced, good service."}
{"text":"i will never go back again.  i ordered fish 'n'chips, and yes, they were supposed to be beer battered.  they were soggy, and gross, and even cold.  not to mention they took about 40 mins to get to my table, when it didn't seem busy at all.   when i  politely explained to the wait staff i didn't like it, and thought it should be a bit hotter, instead of taking my plate, like a normal waitress, she said she'd be back, and came back 10 mins later, and asked \"what do you want me to do? heat it up?'  what a moron- and this is why you will be doing this job for the rest of your life..."}
{"text":"This is a comfortable place, and the sunroom is lovely. The music is not too loud, and the food is reliable. It's a great place to sit and talk. Suitable for families, for seniors, for all ages."}
{"text":"We unfortunately dropped in around 1pm on a Sunday, looking for a brunch place.  The place was toooooo packed.  They expect your to pay full price for a buffet which is almost empty.  We had to ask for most items to be restocked.  It became too much of an effort to have to ask for the restocking.  So after one plate we left.  VERY disappointing. Will never go back to this establishment again!"}
{"text":"This is a low quality brunch.  It must be riding on history or Mississauga standards are markedly lower than Toronto's.  We went and it was packed, but you get low quality pancakes, limited breakfast meat selection and mediocre pastries.  The omelet bar is decent but it burned at least one of our large party's omelettes."}
{"text":"I've only gone for the breakfast buffet, but it was a great experience, with lots of selection at a great price. Wasn't busy at all when I was there with my family."}
{"text":"Awesome classy well mannered service!!!! I'll deff be going back more than once ;).. The host was extremely friendly and welcoming as were the waitresses. The food extremely fresh and tasty. Real fresh  orange juice and maple syrup. Loved the service and food hands down 5/5"}
{"text":"Went in there for Father's Day Brunch. Service was good at the restaurant, no issues. Way over priced.  No value for seniors either.  Plain breakfast nothing special.  2 dudes sweating over 6 frying pans, doing their level best not to burn your  omelette.  Bacon tasted like they cooked the whole pack in a microwave.  If you like quantity than quality. Go here. The best thing?  The freshly squeezed orange juice machine.  Another good thing coffee and juice free included in the price if you are a camel."}
{"text":"I visit this place each and every time i go to Toronto.  The wknd brunch is great, lunch is yummy, dinner has the classics such amazing french onion soup, steak n ceaser, & prime rib.  {I don't eat deserts like i used to, and i recall these guys had the BEST, now i am not too sure.}  None-the-less, all the famDAMily mets here for mini-reuions and we all have a good time.  (just this past wk, i went here 3 times: once for brunch, then late nite coffee & desert, then lunch)  Don't expect this to be the best of the best, but over-all it is dependable, convienent, home-y, reasonable prices for food and drink, and all-u-can eat brunch for $14 can't be beat.  (plus, it's next to love craft - mwahahahaha)  bonus :-)"}
{"text":"The restaurant was nice, we enjoyed the 80's style ambiance. The rest was despicable. We got there at 2:30 pm. We were greeted and served by a man who had some kind of mole on his face. Perhaps he was the owner or managed the restaurant, because no way a staff can keep a job with the kind of attitude this man had towards us. He made us feel like he is doing a favour by taking our order, he would turn around and have his back towards us while still asking questions. Never an eye contact, we honestly felt we are inconveniencing him by him having to serve us. Absolutely horrible service. The food was sub par ..bland. not sure how a very small bowl of ceasar salad is worth 7 dollars but we ended up eating only a few bites from our food as it was just gross. The onion soup was too salty and cold, the burger tasteless. Will never go there again and I caution everyone ..there is much better and more pleasant ways to spend money than visiting that establishment."}
{"text":"Muddy Duck has been around for years. People flock here on weekends for the famed brunch buffet.  Standout's are the omelette station and freshly squeezed orange juice on tap. Croissants, bacon, and waffles were also quite good.   The deli section was slacking. I would have appreciated more variety such as smoked salmon with lox fixins and BAGELS.  3.5"}
{"text":"Used to come to this place a lot a few years ago, quality of food went downhill so stopped coming. Thought we would give it another try. Nope, still pretty bad food for a Saturday evening night out.   Ordered a Mushroom burger from the menu which was supposed to come with their \"chunky\" French fries, while the burger was not too bad the fries were horrible frozen things full of oil. Could not eat them. When the server came I mentioned this to her to be told, oh yes, they are always like that."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on our way out of Toronto Sunday morning, it was recommended to us by a friend for brunch. From a \"value\" standpoint, it comes up short, there is really nothing here that you wouldn't find at a standard buffet, yet they call it \"The Ultimate\". The fellas cooking the omelettes have the heat way to high which burns the outside before the inside is cooked. I asked if I could have jalape√±os, they said no, I asked if they had spinach or goat cheese, no, only basic standard ingredients. There were two positives to this dining experience worth noting. The hasbrowns were very tasty and perfectly cooked and the coffee was good. I had to get my own coffee and I was told that I should have asked the price before ordering when the server saw my reaction to the bill. $55.00 for 2 people at an average buffet. This is higher than most high end hotel buffets and not nearly as good (hasbrowns not withstanding). She was right, I should have asked, we just never expected to pay over 30 bucks per person with tip for breakfast, we were also not given an option or told the price when we sat down. One star for the browns and one for the coffee, best I can do here."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype about this restaurant. The food is substandard and the service is horrible.   I took my family here for a late lunch (party of 5). I had to continuously ask another server to get our server to come for various reasons. Between us ordering drinks and receiving them, about 20 minutes passed. This pretty much carried on throughout the experience. This is the second time I've been to MD and both times the service was really bad.   I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I had a burger with Caesar salad.   The service was friendly. My friend and I were given the choice of sitting anywhere we liked, this was much appreciated.  The burger was excellent.  The atmosphere is family friendly.   The ducks on the walls are entertaining subjects of conversation."}
{"text":"Food on a normal day is meh but the weekend brunch is awesome!! Omelette station, fresh juice and ALL the fixings. This is one of our favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Here's a great family brunch spot which is a definite gem near the airport. It has been at the same location a short bus ride from Kipling subway for around 30 years and counting. There specialty is without a doubt the breakfast buffet which has a variety of options including an omelette station, fruits, meats, breads, waffles and pancakes etc. all which are made fresh throughout the day.  A nice touch is the variety of freshly squeezed juices offered made fresh in front of you for the buffet. It has a beautiful solarium where you can sit at the front of the restaurant. Service is very friendly and it has a very homey atmosphere where it feels like there's a lot of regulars who know each other creating a very friendly   Environment. Pricing is very fair and the portions of food you get for the price is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Good brunch place in Etobicoke. It doesn't rival the places in Downtown Toronto but for an all you can eat brunch, they have a small selection. I would skip the pastries as they are a little hard and dry but the fresh pressed juice was definitely the highlight. Pancakes, waffles, bacon and sausage were fresh and hot. The omelet station was good as well -- however, my omelet was made perfect but my partner's omelet looked more like a messy scrambled egg. Overall, it was a quaint place to eat but not sure I'd return."}
{"text":"Another great Sunday meal!  They have an amazing brunch but we ordered off the regular menu. Schnitzel a al Duck, Baron of Beef with au jus.  Always consistent and yummy.  Great staff and atmosphere.  Nice family time!"}
{"text":"This is my family's standard breakfast/brunch place as it has something for everyone. We come here every few months and every time we leave satisfied, the service is always good, the wait staff are on top of our drinks and clearing our plates.   The buffet offers a variety of hot and cold dishes, ranging from pastries and fresh breads to pancakes, waffles and custom omlettes made in front of you by their cooks (6 at a time as mentioned by the previous poster.) There is also a good selection of fruits to round off your meal. The wait staff will bring you hot tea and coffee but there is also freshly squeezed OJ on the buffet line.  If you come on the weekends and have a large group (4+) I'd highly recommend you call in a reservation as they are usually very busy and you might be waiting a while to be seated."}
{"text":"Brutal $20 breakfast buffet. I swear just go buy the food yourself and make it at home. Eggs for a dozen is 2$. Bacon $4. Hash browns $3. Bread 3$ a loaf. Pancake mix $3 box. You got breakfast for a month!! This place sucks!!! It seems the cleaning lady is making the omelettes!! No fricken idea how to cook whatsoever. Burnt eggs. At least not many people there. All smart.  One good thing that have the second star. Owner is friendly and wants you to eat! If you don't eat enough he tells you to eat more!!  Go next door if you're cheap to Bounty. At least it's 6$ breakfast meal which should be sufficient."}
{"text":"Heading to this neighbourhood, so looked and found this place on yelp. Good homey brunch buffet. Friendly staff, clean dining room.  Highlights: Fresh squeezed orange juice, assorted cured sliced meats, future bakery bread, frosted flakes for my son, custom omelettes, fresh cut fruit. Didn't try the waffles but looked good. Solid and straight forward."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I woke up super late for breakfast on a Sunday morning. Around 12pm, at this point we wanted eggs but something heavier than breakfast... brunch it was. I had heard a lot about Muddy Duck's Restaurant so we decided to try it out.   The buffet offered was great. There was a great variety to show from. The best thing was the freshly made orange juice which was made on the spot in front of you. The place is cozy and it almost makes you feel as though you are at grand ma's home.  They offer brunch on Saturdays and Sundays which they offer from 8am to 2pm. It's $20 which includes juice, coffee and tea.   My only issue is that if you sit inside the restaurant, it's quite dark and there's no toaster to toast your bread."}
{"text":"Wow! I really am wowed. Who knew such a gem of a place existed. Walking in I was immediately welcomed by an old yet favorably cute rustic-country style buffet. Who knew that existed behind those ugly green and yellow walls with lame ducks. The solarium is the place to dine, but I was happy being seated near the fire. If you're not a big eater at breakfast don't bother. This place has everything you could possibly eat at breakfast and much more. Pancakes/waffle bar, egg/omelette making station, assorted cold cuts/cheese, an assortment of pastries, cereal, sausages, eggs, fruit/veggies, cereal, soup ahhhh I'm getting excited at just the thought and that's not even everything. I ate like a Queen, and was treated like one too. Coffee was poured frequently and our waitress was really upbeat and friendly. For $16 a person I think its totally worth it if you have 9 stomachs like me. No worries, I balanced it all out with a glass of freshly squeezed grape fruit juice (:"}
{"text":"I dont know what I am supposed to write about a restaurant that has a soft serve ice cream machine in the buffet area.   So this is a home style, no frills, all you can eat breakfast/dinner spot. For $19.99 you cant go wrong. Come with an appetite and you will be fine. It is very casual, with a lot of food.  You can get made to order eggs, they have about 4 burners, two chefs going at once.  There is a selection of pancakes, waffles, all sorts of meats, cheeses, breads.  Again, its not fancy whatsoever. Service is slow but it is a self serve restaurant so I cant really co sign the complaints from other reviewers here.   I would go back with a group. It gets very busy during brunch."}
{"text":"Up and at 'em Sunday.  We were on our way to the Kipling subway station and decided to stop by the Muddy Duck and try it out.  Since it was only 8:20 a/m. or so, breakfast was $13.95 for the buffet (early bird special).  The buffet had numerous items that consisted of: -Sausage, bacon, waffles, quiche and pancake in one section -Fresh fruits and freshly squeezed juice in another section.   -Breads/sweets in another section -Omelette/made-to-order egg station.    I didn't have any of the waffles or pancakes, but the sausage was average and the bacon was crisp, but a bit salty for my liking, and I think that's exactly what bacon is supposed to taste like.  Maybe I just don't like bacon.    The omelette station is a good touch, and I had one with sausage, mixed veggies, mushroom and cheese.  Cooked perfectly, nice and fluffy and huge.  I also had an overeasy egg to accompany my bread later. lol.  Speaking of breads, they seemed fresh, but I didn't like the ones I grabbed with the exception of one, which was like some type of bread slabbed with butter on top.  This was more soft.  I love soft bread dipped in egg yolk. :-)    What I really liked was the fruit station as they had fresh pineapple, cantaloupe, honeydew, strawberries, oranges, bananas and freshly squeezed orange juice.  I love my fruits!  While not overwhelmingly special, it's more a cheaper version of a good hotel buffet and for that it'd be a 3.5/5, but I'll round to 4 since the server was nice."}
{"text":"Family restaurant with super friendly service and a great breakfast selection. Omelette bar is hosted by talkative and energetic chefs that make the wait seem short. Freshly made waffles are delicious and are adjacent to thick cut bacon not those overly dry, \"ready made\" stuff (though a few were a little undercooked for my liking but were perfect for my wife's tastes). You rarely get thick cut bacon at buffet places, so dig in! A healthy accompaniment was a wide selection of freshly squeezed juices; house blend of carrots, apples, beets, celery and oranges was refreshing and easily my wife's favourite. What a great local find!"}
{"text":"We have been to this local family restaurant several times for either a casual dinner or their Sunday brunch.  Place is nice and friendly, service is decent and food is satisfactory.  With all the other Mom and Pap options in the area we probably won't go back very often."}
{"text":"The Muddy Duck is good for families and groups, and people looking for multiple plates.  Breakfast/Brunch is buffet only. Omelet station was delicious, we arrived during a lull so there was no wait.   Buffet options included waffles, pancakes, potatoes, sausages and bacon. There was bread, bagels, danishes, muffins and a croissant-ish thing all with an available toaster. Freshly squeezed juice and cereal options were also there, along with some sort of ice cream machine.  We were not the target market, this is for people who love getting multiple plates for breakfast. I was happy with my omelette, and disappointed in our bacon. My better half thought her waffle was adequate, but cold. Who wants a waffle sitting around at room temperature?  We were put in a freshly open section, and no server came by, so I served ourselves some coffee. Nothing brings a waitress to your table faster than doing their job for them. We served ourselves food, your only job is to bring me coffee and the bill.   They've been around for over 20 years, (as has the decor) so they are doing something right. We tried something new but this is not the place for us. Omelette station 4 stars, buffet 4 stars, service 2 stars."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant because they had what looked like a breakfast buffet and it was on till 2:00pm. Perfect for my planned brunch date!   There's nothing you can't get. Pancakes, waffles, eggs made to order, bacon, sausage, potatoes, fruit, cereal, a variety of breads/pastries and freshly squeezed juices. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is going to sound a little negative but I will try my best to be more diplomatic. They seriously need to stick with just the breakfast/brunch menu so everything thats fried or toasted is fresh. Period. I assure you that you will somehow enjoy it. Or not. Depends on the cook I guess.   Their dinner menu on the other hand is disappointing. Our appetizer of fried calamari was slightly undercooked, it needed a little more time in the fryer because it would have been perfect. And the lasagna has got to be the worst, it was serious soggy as anyone who knows how to cook can tell that it was frozen and was just reheated in the oven. Not worth $15.   And the dessert, I shared a truffle royale cake and it was not worth $7 because we were handed a small portion. Like for real. Pissed about it still. And it came late too!  Overall, I wouldn't personally go back here anymore but if I had to tell anyone with interest who would like to go here to just go during their brunch/breakfast time. This place seemed like the type where they had older patrons visit over the years and its a hit or miss for the \"younger\" generation."}
{"text":"We used to LOVE this place years ago but stopped visiting when we moved. Upon a recent return Muddy Duck sadly seemed very ordinary. During a fairly quiet mid-week lunch service seemed slow, the lunch specials weren't that great of a value, and ended up being nothing special.  I may chalk it up to a one-off and may give it another chance, but the old Muddy Duck would have made it a much easier decision."}
{"text":"There's four different kinds of fresh juice. Four. And they're all delicious.  Beets Carrot Orange And grapefruit   That's all for now.  Kay, I'm back. There's an omelette concierge...I'm getting a little lightheaded. It's all too much. The fresh smoked black ham, the fresh cream cheese, the strawberries and fresh cream, the fresh rice pudding, the fresh warm waffles, the hotcakes the AHhhhhhhh did I say fresh? For somebody who hates croissants, I happily let that fresh powdery goodness melt in my mouth. In fact, all the baked goods were flaky and buttery and very very tasty. We were super impressed with the breakfast buffet and all they had to offer - you get an insanely great value for your money!   Since I couldn't sleep there I decided to take a piece of Muddy duck back home with me and by piece I mean chocolate mousse pie. I hope it tastes as good as it looks.  Bonus: chamomile tea (a la carte), soft serve frozen yogurt (buffet), real maple syrup and hot dijon mustard!"}
{"text":"Seriously, I just love the liver and onions at this place.  I've probably dined here on numerous occasions over the years.  I like the homey-ness of the place.  (and the super cute duck on the lawn).  That's how you know you're in the right place.   I always want to have dessert, but the portion sizes here are so big, I almost never finish my meal.   I don't know that it's worth the drive here to eat, but it's definitely worth coming here if you are in the hood!  Try the liver and onions, with extra gravy.  My hubby likes the French onion soup."}
{"text":"This review is for their weekend brunch. Came here after the unbearable line up at Cora's on Queensway. Good thing it happened because I would have never found this place! The restaurant is cozy with lots of locals. It is a breakfast buffet with a separate bar for omelletes and waffles. Great service. I would come here again. Paid $45 tax and tip included for two people."}
{"text":"Tried the buffet with the wife, the brother in law and his fiancee and I thought I was just so-so.   The omelettes that were made on the spot were too oily. The bacon was not crisp. The sausages were overdone.   The freshly squeezed orange juice and fluffy pancakes were good. Fruits and pastries were pedestrian. Service was ok.  However I didn't find it good value. $72 plus tips. Thank god my brother in law picked up the bill.   WILL NOT COME BACK."}
{"text":"There's a big duck out front, and somehow we thought that was a positive sign, but overall the brunch buffet was middle of the road. The manager who seated us was kind and enthusiastic, really seemed to care about guests. Saw our server at the beginning, but then he did not return for a long time. My husband had to flag down the manager to get a different soda since he's anti-Pepsi, and the server didn't warn me that that's what I would get when I ordered him a Coke. All in all, that wasn't a huge deal since there's unlimited free juice available at the buffet. The OJ is fresh squeezed and was one of the highlights. The omelet station had a decent selection of toppings, and since that was made while I watched, it was hot and fresh.   Overall, the rest of the food was a bit disappointing. There's cereal, breads, Danishes, muffins, fruit, quiche, sandwich meat, bacon, and sausage, but it was just okay. There's also pancakes and waffles. Waffle was good, but wasn't warm because it was already ready when I got to it and just sitting on a plate, so didn't taste as good room temperature. If you're up for eating a lot of readily available okay food or you and the people you're eating with like different kinds of things, give it a go. Otherwise, the buffet feels like it's $17 for fresh squeezed juice and an omelet, which doesn't seem like as good of a deal."}
{"text":"Finally tried The Muddy Duck this weekend and regretted it. We arrived mid Sunday afternoon for a late  lunch and there were only two other tables yet our food took 40 mins to arrive...ridiculous! After 35 mins of waiting, I asked how much longer it would take for our food to arrive, and our server rudely said there was only so much she could do....I wasn't blaming her, but she was so defensive and totally unapologetic. Heard the server speaking rudely to another table as well. Food was sub par...decent portions but very basic and in terms quality, definitely not worth the hefty prices. If I were evaluating based on wait time and customer service, I would give a \"0\" if I could I'm sure I would have had a much better experience at one of the other restaurants around the area. Never agaIn."}
{"text":"Gadzooks, the Muddy duck is more like the Dead duck, am I on an episode of Hells Kitchen? Dirty, the food was certainly microwaved. The one star is for the poor guy that had to serve this crap."}
{"text":"Got the salmon and chicken with feta crepe. Very very good. Will definitely return. Great selection of flavoured coffee."}
{"text":"I liked this place.   Maybe it helped that I was starving :).   Buffet was alright.   I was late so I had to really rush.   Orange juice was yummy.   Real maple syrup, nice!.  Omelets were like one fellow said,   made with too much oil, but it tasted fine.    Waffles were yummy.     In the whole for their price point, I don't think you can complain.    The service was great.    Everyone tried very hard to please.   On the whole a pleasant surprise...."}
{"text":"Good place for a Saturday family brunch! Easy,simple but cozy environment. If you are looking for creative breakfast, this place is not a good choice for you."}
{"text":"good for sunday brunch but make reservations or expect a line up after 10:30am.... good service, manager on the floor was nice & actually helped clear tables!   awesome waffles -made fresh every few mins, so warm & delish:-)  freshly squeezed orange juice - machine is out front & you can watch it being made. pretty neato!! wasn't a huge fan of their V5 juice tho...  fresh fruits & pastries abound. ... omelette station offered a good amount of toppings & served up really quickly.  DH loved his & had seconds!!  overall, good food selection & decent price. check it out:-)  p.s. love the cozy, homestyle feel to the decor & the duck theme!!"}
{"text":"I've only been here for Brunch...but, wow, it's pretty awesome! Anything you could possibly want for Breakfast can be found here. It's about $40 for the Brunch buffet for two.   Fresh OJ, Sausages, tons of Fruit/Fruit Salads, Croissants, Bagels, Bacon, Eggs made to order.   My only regret is that I didn't take my Wife here when she was pregnant because we really would have gotten our money's worth."}
{"text":"We attended a family brunch for Victoria Day here. It was a pretty good deal, an AYCE brunch, with some hot stations. The guys on the egg station were pros, doing a great job at managing about 10 different pans of eggs at once. They have all the options, everything from waffles to bacon to even some soft serve.  Still, it took me actually tracking a guy down for us to get our coffee refilled, and the whole atmosphere feels slightly grungy and dated. The whole restaurant is in dire need of a facelift. So, it's not awful, but also not somewhere I'd totally go out of my way to go to, unless you have a large group and need reservations."}
{"text":"This place is an old favorite of mine, tucked away in Etobicoke off Dundas rd west this quaint little family restaurant is a little hidden gem.  Catering to a slightly older crowd the Muddy Duck's menu reflects this; they have a tried and true menu that stays pretty much the same with a small feature menu that offers new chef selections. Personally I love the menu, it is large enough offering salads, pasta's, burgers and some really good entree's, many that seem inspired by European cuisine and done very well too. A variety of Schnitzel dishes, perogies and other authentic and delicious dishes, but the main menu always stays the same so your sure to get your favorites anytime you crave them. My go to fav here? The le grande; real french onion soup served with Caesar Salad and garlic french stick bread. Absolutely delicious served fast and fresh, perfect every time but I will forewarn its a fair bit of garlic in one little dish so a lunch date may not be the best time to order this one. You won't want to miss the dessert display ... well its hard to miss with all the wonderful treats they make in house... too good! They always offer buffets I remember they had a fantastic breakfast buffet but now they are advertising a later dinner/evening Italian buffet that sounds rather intriguing but haven't tried as of yet.  The location itself I find very welcoming and warm, plenty of space with several seating areas including the most popular sun room but in the cold summer months sitting by one of the several real fire places is the place to be.  In all the years I have visited here I have only had one negative experience in regards to service but other then that I have always had fast, friendly and efficient servers. This place does get very busy in the peak hrs.... breakfast, lunch and dinner but the place is large enough to accommodate it. And I will say this again and again.... YAY they have free parking!!!  Ultimately this is a really great family restaurant and if your ever in the area I suggest you try it"}
{"text":"There are a few restaurant places like this in that stretch of Dundas Street on the Mississauga/Toronto border. I love the duck figures that are outside, so i stopped in because of that lol  We stopped in for their brunch, which was pretty standard equivalent to a Golden Griddle sort of buffet breakfast. Definitely a step up from a greasy spoon, but pretty ho-hum food. It is OK as a cheap breakfast, but not sure i'd go back."}
{"text":"Nice family restaurant that's been open for a long time in the east side of Mississauga.  I haven't ate here years but when I finally came back it was nice to enjoy their yummy food.  Their appetizers are delicious and I also enjoyed their lasagna,  shrimp and chicken pasta which was really good.  My friends had the ribs and steak which was reasonably priced but I was just okay.  If my friends are open to eat g there again I wouldn't mind going.  The staff that worked there are really nice a few crabby ones but that's about it.  Definitely worth giving it a try one time"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for lunch. The place was not busy but the service was very slow and the waitress seemed flustered. When we got our food it was just average, nothing special. Place was very clean. Not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"What great buffet place you can stuff yourself silly with great food . The staff is great very friendly and helpful great place to eat"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to going out for lunch on a Saturday. Picked the Muddy Duck--very disappointed in the service. Did not appreciate the waitress wiping her runny nose on her hand then on her sleeve.  Ordered the Bruschetta and a breakfast. The Bruschetta was cheese and cut up tomato on toasted French bread, no flavour except the horrible taste from the cheese--explained to the waitress was told it couldn't have a bad taste.  The breakfast was fine. We will not be going back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is like on of those late night places you go to because nothing else is open or you dont have time to seek other options The place is old and extremely unkempt..service is just ok and food is just ok Options are limited just standard breakfast items on the buffet menu The omelette station is a wreck They use way too much egg y the time they pour the omelette on your plate it looks like it fell on the floor Its like when you fill up at mandarin and curse to never go back cause you feel like shit after and for the next 2 days lol Same feeling at this place...def not worth the price at all!!!"}
{"text":"We always see this restaurant whenever we pass the Mississauga-Toronto border. Something with that dark green facade and white lettering, and the quirky sound of \"Muddy Duck\" caught my interest. One Saturday after an early appointment, my husband and I finally tried it. On weekends though, they only have breakfast/brunch buffet until 2pm and they don't serve anything from the regular menu. Now buffets are risky because quality often suffers for quantity, and as I feared it was a bit of a mayhem in there. We came at past 10am and the place was packed but we managed to get a table. One look at the buffet set-up and I wanted to change my mind, but we were already there. Anyway, there were heaps of everything and they did a pretty good job in making sure the trays were not empty. One time I saw the cook taking out a big mound of pancakes. I'm not a fan of mass production and I'd rather my food be done meticulously and with a lot of love. Anyway, most of the food were cold except for the freshly made omelettes. There's fresh orange juice which was all right and a selection of other fruit drinks. The bread/pastries section was okay, but no oven in sight for a little bit of warming. The sausages were wrinkled and overcooked, and bacon was not crispy. Waffles were probably the best I had during the buffet. Maple syrup was just left out there in big jugs, which I found a bit barbaric. Another thing I noticed, their plates seemed a bit off-- more like decorative plates which don't really go with the homey country feel of the restaurant. The service was good though, and they knew exactly when to refill my coffee. I also think the interior is charming and I'd considering coming back to give it another try.. But next time I'd go for the regular menu rather than their weekend buffet."}
{"text":"We've been coming to the Muddy Duck restaurant for their Saturday & Sunday brunches for years. Hint: if you prefer to avoid lineups, come on Saturday morning, it's the exact same deal.  No law against it, is there? So much to say about their buffet & so little time! So let me highlight: fresh  squeeze juices of all kinds,  cold cuts,  pickles, cheeses, bread, muffins, make your own omelettes, you can add SHRIMP to your omelette! All kinds of tea or coffee.  Soft serve frozen yogurt, fresh fruit,  cake,  tarts.  Crudites next to cold cuts.  Cute duck decor all over.  Muddy Duck how do I  love thee?  Let me count the ways!  No, can't count em all. Come and eat yourself!"}
{"text":"My weekend brunch to this Mississauga institution was part of a celebratory affair.  Our close friends were celebrating 50th anniversary and for nearly a decade, they ate brunch here every 2nd Sunday.  Considering this place has stood the test of time,  it has to be doing something right!  Our group arrival was shortly after 10 am and service is very friendly and warm.  To be honest, it was probably the best thing about the place.  Quick happy service with the restaurant manager talking to everyone and making sure everything is up to their standards.  It's rare to see such dedication from everyone.  Even though it was 60% full,  all plates were removed quickly,  coffee refilled, and conversations always occurred.  I think they get a 4 star for service.  The food was buffet style and it was your usual continental breakfast with a made to order omelette.  It was well stocked and very clean.  Some items seem to be nearing their 'best before' date as croissants and Danishes seem stale and mushy.  Bacon and sausages were lukewarm.  The pancake was too moist from sitting around too long.    I wish I could rate this higher but the plentiful food wasn't warm or memorable as the service.  Even the funny duck outside the restaurant sticks in your mind longer than the food."}
{"text":"Cost was about $15 with tax for breakfast on a Saurday morning. Danishes were great as well as the orange juice and fresh fruit. Solid breakfast all the way around. Some other foods included deli meats, muffins, waffles, pancakes, omelets, and cereal just to include some but not all items."}
{"text":"Slow service, food ( I got the Stilton burger) was average. The solarium is very cozy though."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast/brunch buffet. Cozy country ambiance. Great hospitality and very attentive service. I was extremely impressed by the quality of the waffles, pancakes, sausages, cold cuts, fresh juices, and custom omelets. The fresh apple/beet/celery juice was sooo good. Muddy Duck is at the top of my list for the next time I'm in the area.  At about $12 per person, it's a genuine gem."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited here for Saturday brunch and it was a nice, friendly place that seemed very popular as it was buzzing and busy.  There was a large selection of foods in the buffet (which both of us got) to suit all taste types.  At the time we went it was a bit picked over and they didn't get around to refilling things until we were just getting ready to leave.  Maybe we needed to eat slower!"}
{"text":"We went there for a birthday brunch with about 10 people. The food was hot, the eggs were well cooked and the pancakes were soft and fluffy. The price wasn't the cheapest for a brunch buffet, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"We went to The Muddy Duck this morning as a group of friends who go to school and had completed another set of exams this week. We decided on the breakfast buffet, which was amazing, with lots to choose from. There were made to order omelets, which included fresh ingredients of our own choice, waffles, pancakes, continental breakfast items, fruit, eggs, bacon, sausages and so much more.  The restaurant itself was quiet and relaxing, although I have been told it is a busy place during the weekend. We had good service and were well looked after by our server who kept us topped up with plenty of coffee. We sat in the sun room which was pleasant and bright while we stayed for quite a while discussing our future academic plans. I would recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"All-you-can-eat breakfast/brunch. If you are looking for something with healthier options, this is not the place. Some variety of bread, pastries, but nothing too special. The omelete is very greasy. Too pricy in my opinion."}
{"text":"They have good breakfast buffet for $22.99 a adult and $12.99 for kid.  Is bit pricey for breakfast but you can find good hot food, they make you egg you like and you can have sandwich if you prefer. You have to try the orange juice they have, I promised you will not regarded. They have freshes orange juice EVER!  I wish to given 5 star but they place need to be touch up a bit."}
