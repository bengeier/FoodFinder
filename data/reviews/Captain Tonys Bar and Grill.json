{"text":"Husband and I tried captin tonys last  night. Nice atmosphere. Clean, new and non fussy. We both tried a totra . Different flavors. We liked them. They are huge though.
I recomend spliting one with someone and maybe adding an app. or soup. Nice bar. Only complaint was the music was so loud we had to yell over ;it. The server did get it turned down for us. Background music during the dinner hour would be welcome. Just not screaming loud. Owners were willing to listen to our suggestions about our experience there. I say give it a try. Small independent business' need our support.
Nice patio too. Go support them."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place.  Went here thinking it was still The Oasis.  Come to find out ownership has changed again.  However, could be for the better.  While I loved breakfast at The Oasis, Captain Tony's was a good stop for lunch - haven't tried dinner yet, but plan to.  The menu is sort of all over the place - mexican, burgers, seafood.  I had the quesadilla and my friend had the California Burrito which she loved.  Overall, pretty good and will definitely go back.  Nice patio."}
{"text":"Decided to give this local place a try last night. It was around 6:00 pm and wasn't too busy. Seemed like an older, local crowd. The bartender and wait staff were all very friendly. The inside is clean with a bit of lodgey feel to it. Plenty of flat panel TVs too for such a small place. However, given how few people were there, it was a bit on the quiet side (I am still amazed at how many restaurants don't place a little background music for ambiance!). I had a couple Miller Lites from the tap and the glasses were ice cold (hit the spot on this hot day). The menu was sort of an American/Mexican hybrid. I asked what was popular and was told that the burritos, tortas, and burgers were all big sellers. I decided to try the smoked pork chop torta (never had a torta before) and it was pretty good. The pork chops could have been a tad more tender, but it definitely had a Mexican flavor to it (probably the guacamole and Mex cheese on it). The fries on the side were typical diner fries, nothing special. Overall, my bill for the torta, fries, 2 draft beers and tip was $15 ... not bad. I'd like to stop back some time and try the \"super burrito\" when I'm more hungry."}
