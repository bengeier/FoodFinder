{"text":"The first time we ordered was great - awesome portion sizes and great flavour! only downside was the delivery person could not find our house - on a well lit street with a number out front. (whatever - the food was great and so what if we had to nuke it for a few mins right???....)  Tonight was the second night we ordered and WOW what a difference. We ordered the singapore vermicelli as a reorder and Oh My Lord it was a totally different dish. We actually found it nearly inedible (and we are pretty easy going....) It was kind of pasty ...like as if the seasoning's hadn't quite dissolved or were not mixed well (??) Not to mention, I had to call to find out if our order was on the way after over an hour of waiting. When we finally got our order it was actually cold. Not warm...not barely warm - COLD. We put it in the microwave and it was ok, but the point is when you order out, you expect it comes hot - so you don't need to do anything with it! Overall, I've ordered from this place 2 times and although the dishes are good - its nothing is great. There are other MUCH MUCH better thai take out restaurants in South Mississauga! I will not be ordering from this place again - sorry!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I really hoped that this place would be at least half decent.The noodles were particularly awful, drowning in soy sauce and yet completely tasteless."}
{"text":"The sign on the door claims to be very authentic. This is not the case. This is Chinese food with some thai inspiration. 

The volume of food you get for the money is great, but it's just not very good food. Things like pineapple and shrimp are stingy to the point of almost wondering if they forgot to put them in.

Tried it once, would not try it again."}
