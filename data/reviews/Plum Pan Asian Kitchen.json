{"text":"Plum is a great option if you want sushi and prefer a more upscale atmosphere. Sky is an excellent sushi chef, and try to sit at the sushi bar so you can watch his work. All the fish is very fresh and beautifully prepared. There is a small and nice bar area with a TV, and the restaurant is very nicely decorated. I adore the plum/lychee martini!"}
{"text":"Confusion [kuh n-fyoo-zhuh n]  noun 1.the act of confusing. 2.the state of being confused. 3.disorder; upheaval; tumult; chaos: 4.lack of clearness or distinctness:   A great Chinese philosopher Confucius once uttered, \"serving delicious and beloved traditional dishes in a tasteless  and over priced manner shall be  called \"confusion\". -Confucius (:-)  A beautiful and chic decor was impressive as it felt as if I was entering an upscale and contemporary cafe in Manhattan, NYC. Having said that, there was not a single dish that was impressive. Pad Thai was watery and bland while the eggplant with tofu (extra $2) was ok at best.  Pad Thai did not have any crushed peanuts so we asked for some crushed peanuts (extra $3). We had requested the eggs in Pad Thai to be served on the side since we were dining with a  vegan friend (extra $2).  They don't tell you about the extra charges up front and we only discovered it when we received our check. We were  relieved to see the check did not include charges for using the restroom twice and looking in the mirror thrice (a la the inn keeper in the musical,  Les Mierables).  The wait staff needs to be trained by a professional as they appeared to be bunch of introverts and lacked any signs of enthusiasm. We dined on a Sunday night around eight and the place was almost empty. Not a good sign. While the name says \"Pan Asian\" the menu had no Vietnamese (no pho or spring/summer rolls) or Korean dishes  (kimchee or bibimbop) on the menu!  Are you serious?  The owners apparently does not understand the meaning of the word \"Pan\" used in \"Pan Asian\". It's like opening up a Pan American restaurant and serving only the dishes from United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.... Perhaps the owners were using the word \"Pan\" in the context of \"Frying Pan\"... While the menu comprised of random selections of Chinese, Japanese (sushi only, no udon, ramen, etc ) and Thai in traditional and fusion styles, none of the dishes had the flavors that made the traditional versions a beloved national dishes.  We had pan fried veggie dumplings (bland and unimpressive) served in a traditional style with watered down soy sauce to accompany it and the pad thai noodles were watery and lacked flavors. The best tasting dish of the night was the hot and sour soup, priced at four dollars  bowl! Overall, this restaurant is over priced while it under delivers. I do not like to leave negative reviews  and I seldom do but the purpose of websites like Yelp is to make honest and objective reviews for the consumers. As such, I don't think this restaurant is worth a visit unless you want to experience first hand the true meaning of the word \"confusion\"."}
{"text":"For starters, we had the Endive Lettuce Boat with Shrimp. It's a bit pricey, but it's definitely a \"must-order\". The shrimps are very chewy and not dry, and they give generous portion of shrimps (about 3-4 shrimps per boat).  For soup, I had the wonton soup, and my girlfriend had the hot & spicy soup. The portion is not huge (which is expected given that the soup is only $3-4). Of the two, we would recommend the hot & spicy soup. The wontons are delicious, but the soup tastes just like regular water.  I ordered the rainbow roll, which is extremely delicious. All the ingredients are fresh, and everything was perfect.  My girlfriend had the sushi club, which was that night's feature. It is like a sushi sandwich. The toast is replaced by rice and soy crepe. The insides are ingredients that you would found in those specialty rolls. I would definitely come back and order this again."}
{"text":"Food would not be able to compete if it were in a proper food focused city. But Pittsburgh isn't one of those towns. And this place totally gets the job done. If you're ever in need of quality MSG-free Asian food with consistent flavor and proper technique, this is your spot. Avoid the Americanized dishes and ask for carved fresh fruit for dessert. Plum is a great spot for a weeknight dinner."}
{"text":"Great ambience, good service, and very inviting. Ate here several times. However proceed with caution when ordering takeout. Food is a complete hit or miss..."}
{"text":"Decor was aesthetically pleasing.  Service was nothing special.  Food was a small notch above PF Chang's.  I don't eat sushi, so i can't speak on that.  Would go back if invited, but won't be in a hurry to go again on my own.  Worth a try, though."}
{"text":"We were the last guests in the restaurant and they provided wonderful service. We did not feel like an inconvenience at all! Andrew really took care of us and pulled out all the stops with drink recommendations and meal selection. The food was excellent. The Volcano roll came lit on fire! The portions were huge, Plenty of food to share and even some for tomorrow. This was our first experience and we will definitely return to Plum!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the curry and atmosphere. I would put this on my \"maybe one day I'll go back in the future\"."}
{"text":"Very nice place to get Eastern Asian food. Seafood dishes are very tasty. Ambiance is very nice with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Arrived Friday night w/o reservations. I asked if the bartender had blue cheese olives.  She responded, \"We don't have any cheese here.\"  Okay; a pronouncement not so gently made and embarassing to me.  This is your philosophy, yet your bar serves specialty drinks.  It was a bit uncomfortably delivered to me. Ordered the shrimp and scallop w lemon grass sauce.  The scallops were bay scallops and large and done well in terms of texture.  The shrimp were just a wee bit overcooked.  But the sauce was a disaster; it needed to be put through a food mill.  It was grainy, not coherent in flavor and inexpertly done.  The baby bok choys were woefully overcooked.  And the onions had been put through a food processor.  The onions added nothing to the dish.  Truly, the choy and the onions served as a base on which to sit the scallops and shrimp.  As a dish, not coherent.  But the sauce, again, was awful.  No flavor of lemon grass.  Wait staff very casual and tentative.  Waiter  took the order of a table seated after us.  Then turned to us and said he'd get to us.  The meals were delivered and the rice was placed down.  Then the waiter returned w a serving spoon for the rice.  And nanoseconds later, asked if the food was all right."}
{"text":"This would be a very nice spot for a date or business meal. It's a lovely space, though the little details are looking rather worn. Our waiter was attentive and the food was plated nicely.  However...the food was not great. Acceptable, but there are plenty of other Asian restaurants all over the city with excellent food. We chose this one because it was convenient, and they had happy hour until 7 (!). The catch: happy hour is only available at the bar or the sushi bar. They will also give you their happy hour prices at the outside table, but of course, this isn't option in March. No one mentioned this to us at the front, or we would have asked to be seated at the bar. The bar is also not very big, so if there's more than four or five people, I guess you're out of luck. Looking at the menu online, I see that they have it printed right at the top. So I guess you need to read the fine print on the menu."}
{"text":"Between this place and BRGR across the strreet... you might not need to leave this street corner... Plum is great, the drinks are a tad pricey but if you don't walk in there and realize that, you only have yourself to blanme!   The rolls are great! The management is great and very friendly! The soup is on point... you can tell it is sitting there for a couple of hours but where is it not!   Make sure to make a reservation because the place packs quickly!"}
{"text":"Love the dishes at this restaurant. There are so many vegetarian options and they're all delicious. I recommend the mee goreng noodle dish and the skinny dip sushi roll. The ambiance is also beautiful. The restaurant is spacious and never packed. I always make a reservation but you probably don't need to make one unless you're a party larger than 4."}
{"text":"Nice decor, but generally overpriced. Website isn't updated at all and the overall customer experience isn't great. I've been here twice, and both times felt my bill was way to expensive for what it was and the service fell short. My latest experience was when I called in to order lunch for pick up, they took my order. Only after going to pick it up did they tell me it would be 60% more than what was listed on the website because 'they only serve dinner all day on Sunday'. Pointed out that their website doesn't say that -- at which point the girl I talked to told me she told me that over the phone (she had not). There are other options nearby (literally within half a block of this place) that have better service, less 'confusing' menus, and better value."}
{"text":"Great food at great prices and a fun atmosphere. But every time I've been here, the servers have been less than adequate...slow and unresponsive."}
{"text":"Ever been to PF Changs? Ok, imagine you're in PF Changs except there are more windows, way less people, and no music playing. That's Plum, summarized.  I don't like sushi, so I can't comment on that, but the other main dishes are good. The cocktails are tasty, the food is standard. I usually get egg rolls and orange chicken, and it's all comparable to PF Changs. I always have leftovers.  But man...it's always so dead inside. And so, so quiet. It's a bummer. It could be a nice little date spot."}
{"text":"Amazing. I had the opportunity to dine here solo tonight since my husband is out of town on business. Food was perfect.  Tonight, for I believe the first time a \"chef's special\" was simply that in all its sweet and savory spectacularness- SPECIAL. I order all sushi.   The chef's special was a tempura wrapped sushi stuffed with decadent chunks of white tuna, wrapped in fresh avocado, topped with gobs of lobster salad. Seriously, does life get any better than this? It is lightly doused with mango puree. It sounds like it would be too sweet. But once dipped in soy sauce and heavily soaked fresh wasabi= HEAVEN. The pearly gates serves this dish daily. Dramatic much? I think not. I spoke with the chef, as I dined solo at the sushi bar. I raved about his food and I shared with him that I have had the first REAL chef special I have ever eaten. He humbly and plainly shared with me...sushi can be so simple: fish, seaweed, and rice. I think, I must take sushi to an elevated place. And he did. I am elated at the final products.  I also ordered the Marilyn Mon Roll. Let it be known: I am a die hard spider roll fan: fried soft shell crab, avocado, cucumber, masago fish egg...tonight I have become a changed eater. The Marilyn Mon Roll is spider roll meets decadence. Fried soft shell crab, cucumber, tobiko caviar wrapped in avocado, topped with spicy mayo and eel sauce. The avocado is interestingly wrapped on the outer side of the roll. This highlights the chef's excellent knife skills. Slightly thicker than paper thin. All the flavors are balance. Many places in the 'burgh can provide an extraordinary meal but left unbalanced and often times missing...something. Not here raw fish lovers. Come one, come all- only if your refined palette can appreciate this experience.  Don't be deceived...this is not \"fake\" sushi found at such places as the wanna be sushi joint that immature sushi seekers flock to in the southside. Loved is the art, skill, and tradition turned modern interpretation here."}
{"text":"ASIAN FUSION DONE POORLY:  Food: 1 / 5 Service: 1 / 5 Atmosphere: 4 / 5 Price: 1 / 5 Overall: 1.75 / 5  5 of my friends and I went during an uncrowded and not busy Thursday evening. We were immediately seated but the waiters were incredibly slow. It took at least 30 minutes to get drinks and refills. Then, it took approximately 1 hour for all of our food to arrive, which is absurdly for a slow evening. And note, we ordered about 3 rolls and 3 mains so really not an insane amount of food.   As for the food, quite sub par. The skin around their deep fried foods is very thick. The quality of the sushi rice is not great. The Philadelphia roll in particular, had way too much cream cheese (and my cousin loves his cream cheese). Their $17 Thai Basil Stir Fry is mediocre at best; you're better off ordering a better $12 stir fry at any Thai restaurant.  This restaurant is definitely not worth the price.  The inside is pretty though, and the lighting is not too dark nor loud like many trendy restaurants these days. I liked how I was able to see what I ate. If I'm REALLY knit picking, the chairs are pretty low for the table, but that's just a minor detail. Anyway, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"--- Absolutely NOT a fusion cuisine--- it is a shameful fission --- The menu is a hodgepodge of dishes from various Asian extractions. It is a pretentious over-priced restaurant serving mostly Chinese-like dishes. The very big menu indicates an unimaginative kitchen crew. The egg rolls are very greasy, dry, bland, and almost charred! Many of the dipping sauces are painfully sweet. The sushi, if one could call it that, is choked in undercooked small grain rice. If you want fusion, go to Soba. If you want sushi, go to Umi. If you want Thai, go to Thai Gourmet or Thai Tamarind or Smiling Banana."}
{"text":"I don't think the prices are badly priced at all! Sure, it's not necessarily cheap Chinese food but for the quantity and quality, you get your money's worth. I ordered the Honey Walnut Chicken for $15 and the portion was extremely generous. I took half of it home for lunch the following day.  We Made a reservation earlier in the day and were seated within 5 minutes of arriving. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. For starters, we got the Angel Roll followed by our entrees and everything was delicious. We will definitely be back. Absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"This place just barely gets 5 stars for us. The sushi is GREAT, the rest of the menu is pretty good. It's not the best, but since most the choices are still very tasty, come in large portions, and very reasonably priced when I always take half of it home, it gets that 5th star.  We always start our experience with a specialty cocktail, which are all very tastey! I've been here 4, 5, maybe 6 times and tried a different cocktail each time. I approve all, though I am really partial towards the ginger one.  Miso soup is a must for our appetizer! It's a small portion, but it's like a little bowl of miso heaven.   We will typically follow up with a roll or two. This is our go-to place for sushi rolls. The portions are large, presentation is beautiful, fresh ingredients are used, and they are well-priced for the portion size. The tuna spring roll is amazing, definitely a non-traditional roll but it satisfies us just fine.   Our favorite non-sushi item is the basil black cod, served in a clay pot. It's enough for two people to share (if you've had all the previous items we typically order) and you'll be full without paying a ridiculous price.   The service is friendly and as fast as you can expect for a crowded dinner place. We typically go a little later and also make reservations so we can get faster service. The ambiance allows you to enjoy the experience and not worry too much about a wait, if there is one.  Overall, this is our favorite place to go for sushi and a guaranteed tasty experience, whether its lunch or dinner.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place was really good.  Good fresh flavors, we had a veg and tofu dish, a pork dish and a chicken dish it was all good.  The food came out really fast.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the hostess was a little scattered and came off as quite rude at times."}
{"text":"I'm speechless from the amazing customer service experience I just had. I have eaten here a few times before and had a great time. This time I decided to order from Postmates for delivery. Unfortunately my order came without any of my sushi (which of course was the main reason I ordered!) so I first contacted postmates. After that, I decided to give the restaurant a call to politely ask if it was the drivers mistake or see If in fact the food never left the restaurant. I cannot believe what happened next. Mark (I believe the manager) told me the food was still there and then delivered it himself to my door!! At an incredible speed might I add. I told him it was not necessary but he did it anyway. What a wonderful experience. They definitely understand the importance of the guest as well as \"word of mouth\" in this business. So glad to see. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Dined here with a friend recently. I recommend the dinner menu rather than the sushi and appetizers, our sushi and appetizer items were mediocre at best. My dinner selection was good, my friend's dinner selection was bland. The service was fair albeit disorganized, we had to ask the manager to summon the waitress for our appetizer order. I may return to give another chance."}
{"text":"Best General Tso chicken, ever.  Prices are very reasonable.  Very large selection of dishes."}
{"text":"My partner and I dined at Plum about a month ago and were satisfied overall with the experience, despite a few snags here and there. We arrived around 8:30 PM. This was significantly later than when we usually eat, but we decided to avoid the crowds and instead opted for a low-key, leisurely experience. It was very quiet and peaceful. Walking through the entrance felt like entering a museum, it was so beautiful. It was definitely more upscale than we were used to, though it still managed to appear approachable. The atmosphere was sophisticated yet warm. The décor was very much minimalist and modern; the color was limited to various tones of white mixed with dark wood. However, the candles set on the tables and the cozy seating made the setting feel quite intimate: the perfect spot for a romantic date. The hostess greeted us with a warm smile, and had us seated quickly in a comfortable spot by the window.   To start, we ordered drinks. The wine and beer list was extensive and easy to navigate, as was the menu. We each chose one of their select IPAs. Each was smooth and crisp and served in a tall, elegant beer glass. The glasses were tall and slim--another welcome touch of modernity. We then ordered spring rolls for our appetizer. We were less enthused by these. They were uncharacteristically soggy, and didn't have much flavor aside from the dipping sauce they came with.  Despite the minor setback, we were eager to try the sushi! My partner ordered the Marilyn Mon Roll--the restaurant's own twist on the traditional Spider Roll. I myself ordered the eel and avocado roll. Both were astonishingly delicious. We loved it so much that we put in another two orders!   Despite our luck with the sushi, we were disappointed by the frequency in which we saw our server. This would be more understandable during prime business hours, but we were one of only three couples there, and this was a relatively late mealtime. We often saw multiple waiters chatting in the corner. This led us to infer that the staff was inattentive because they were tired from a long day and wanted only to socialize and get home. As understandable as this sentiment may be, it is important that the customers feel attended to and comfortable. After all, this is what we are paying for.  When the waiter returned, we thanked him for the meal and requested our checks. This process was much quicker than anything else had been, confirming my earlier theory on inattentiveness.  As we finished our meal and prepared to go, we noticed one last thing: the music. \"All Summer Long\" by Kid Rock was playing. Compared to the otherwise sophisticated atmosphere of the restaurant, this particular detail came off as cheesy. The contrast was pretty off-putting, and my partner and I couldn't help but laugh. We then proceeded to pay our bill and gather up our things. There wasn't a server in sight by this point, which made our departure a very awkward and cold experience. It felt as if we had broken into the place and were trying to quietly sneak out before anyone noticed there was food missing.  Overall, our experience was satisfying, despite the lagging service and questionable choice in 'mood music'. Based on the sushi alone, I would highly recommend Plum. However, for the amount one pays in such a restaurant, a certain level of service is expected, and we were left disappointed."}
{"text":"we had a really bizarre experience...it was a sunday night...not very busy...actually kind of empty. the service was slow and the waiter complained about how tired he was from working all day ( I don't know...maybe there was a private party or something but plum didn't open till 4...maybe he had another gig...i don't know but he was a sad sack!) we ordered stir fry...it took too long considering there was hardly anyone there and...it came out tepid!!! not hot and steaming! and by the time the waiter came to check on us it was darn cold! so...he said he would have the dishes remade...and eek...they re-wokked( is that a word?) our cold dishes...and...i can't even believe this...it was still cold!!! we complained...saw the manager checking us out...he did not come over...he hid behind the wall...it was very frustrating...i was hungry and annoyed and didn't want to cause a scene...we paid...expensive for what it was...and left....never to return..."}
{"text":"So disappointing!  I ordered take out and could barely eat it.  The green beans were soggy, the pad Thai unremarkable. The sweet and sour soup, so salty! And the won ton soup..really like dishwater!  All this for almost $40...I don't know what hurts more, my wallet or my stomach."}
{"text":"If you like P.F. Changs, then this is your place. They call their food pan-Asian, but what this translates into is really Asian-inspired American food. With the exception of the sushi, the food strays far from anything resembling an authentic dish, obliviously with the intent of pleasing the American palate. 2 stars seems kind of harsh, but the description, \"I've experience better,\" is exactly what I felt. It you are in the mood for something a bit more authentic, I would start with a restaurant that narrows their scope to one Asian country. That said, fake, Americanized Asian food may be your thing and in this case you may love this place."}
{"text":"I want to give Plum a better rating, I really do.  I would go for three and a half stars if possible.   Overall, the decor and location are great.  I only go to Plum for the sushi, which I can safely say is excellent.  The prices are reasonable and the quality is fantastic. However, it is the experience with the service here that brings down my rating.   The first time I had gone, it was a relativity slow day, and although our food did take a while to get to the table, it was nothing to complain about.  I quickly forgot my annoyance by how wonderful and fresh the sushi was.   Onto my next visit:  The service was literally one of the worth experiences I have ever had at a restaurant.  I understand it is difficult during the crazy lunch rush for the servers, but once we placed our order we never saw her again.  No one came to re-fill our water glasses, we were sitting at the sushi bar so the sushi chef gave us our food, and I then waited for almost 30 minutes for our check.  When I realized she wasnt even coming over to our area, we went and gave our cards to the front of the house.  My biggest suggestion: block out a significant amount of time before you visit Plum."}
{"text":"The egg rolls are so good! Our waitress, Jessica, whom we've had twice now is so sweet! I got vegetable dumplings today and they were amazing!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere lovely and serene.    I had the hot and sour soup which was quite tasty, but pretty much like all others I've had in my life.  For my entree I had the basil chicken with brown rice--it was fine, nothing spectacular.  I don't think they used Thai basil in it, just the regular sweet basil, and I was disappointed by that.    My favorite Thai place, The Green Mango, has a fabulous basil chicken--this did not compare.    Overall, it was good, but I will not be running back to it like I do with the Green Mango."}
{"text":"So, a group of nearly 20 of us had made plans to gather for lunch as one of our friends was leaving Pittsburgh.  We had selected a popular chain restaurant on the South Side - one known for its desserts - however, the manager told me that during the holiday season, certain \"rules for larger parties\" have been put into place: a limit of 4 credit cards for the entire group (\"servers don't have the time\")...a 2 hour limit for the duration of the party - these \"rules\" were being spilled out via a sour and bored face tinged in arrogance (\"You're putting US at an inconvenience if you come in at 12:00 rather than at 11:00); I was so unimpressed with the disregard this manager expressed for our future patronage that i made the reservation with every intention of cancelling and finding another restaurant.  And, that restaurant was PLUM! From making the reservation to the time we departed, the experience was simply A+; the manager was both cordial and accommodating; the staff was very friendly, efficient, and attentive!  We were allowed to bring in a sheet cake which they helped us to serve...they accepted both cash and credit cards without any drama. . . everyone enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. There was no time limit placed on our party. We all felt they really appreciated our patronage .... . . I would strongly recommend PLUM for any gathering or meet up. . . Great food; great staff,polite, friendly and very accommodating. .. clean premises; FREE PARKING... thanks, PLUM!"}
{"text":"I work right beside this place and have stopped in for lunch once or twice.  The ambiance is great and the wait staff was attentive.  The food is OK.  The prices are a bit high for the quality of the food.  I've had the pad thai and also the pineapple fried rice.  I've never tried the Sushi but my co-workers mentioned that they've had better around the city.  All in all its a nice place but it's a little over priced for average \"Chinese\" food."}
{"text":"Just had my first meal at Plum.  The lemongrass shrimp and scallops were spot on.  Large, quality seafood and great flavor.  Would definitely come back.."}
{"text":"I am basing my rating on the quality of both the sushi and the service.  Both are very good.  Keep in mind that I have not sampled the non-sushi dishes (the sushi is too good to pass up).  Truth be told, Plum's sushi isn't the absolute best that I've ever had, but it is excellent.  Consider getting one of the combination platters; the chef makes worthwhile selections."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this restaurant for a while now, and I've never had a bad experience or a bad dish.  I'm a sushi novice, but the sushi I've had here was quite good.  All of the dishes I've had have been yummy and fairly priced, and the rice that comes on the side of most of the dishes seems to be perfectly cooked.  I'm also impressed with the friendliness of the staff and the rapidity with which your food is served to you.  There have been quite a few times that my girlfriend and I have come in, eaten an appetizer and our dinners, and left in under an hour because the kitchen and staff are just that fast."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I would not recommend it.  The quality of food is sub par and I find the service to be unfriendly and a little arrogant.  I've given it atleast 5 chances which I think is fair."}
{"text":"The service I got here this weekend just bumped this up to 5 stars.  This is for sure the best pan-Asian cuisine in the neighborhood.  Called the day-of for a Saturday night reservation and they didn't have any, which I thought was suprising, and I said my part of five wouldn't mind sitting along the wall or something.  15 minutes they called back and had a table for us, and when we got there, it was one of the best tables in the house.  That said, I was trying so hard to make a res because  their Plum Duck Special is the most succulent duck I've ever had, and it is perfect every time and beautifully presented.  Everything else, like Pad Thai, random sushi rolls, Tuna tartar type app, the Chinese dishes- these are standard but very well done and I would say more like in the $$$ price range, contrary to some other reviews but def better than the Thai, Sushi and Chinese places on walnut which are similarly priced.  So to sum up: excellent food, great location, really nice ambiance, great service and a little bit more pricey than some of it's peers but worth it.    Get the duck."}
{"text":"This is not my favorite Wendy's location.   1) the drive through is always closed. You have to eat in and parking in yuppie East Liberty is impossible these days.   2) they screwed up the logo on the sign. It is very difficult to tell that this is indeed a Wendy's.   3) they were out of all my favorite Wendy's foods like baconator, nuggets, FROSTY.... even french fries. How the hell do you run out of french fries?   4) the alternate menu was a confused jumbled mess of cuisines without any coherent identity. Also, sushi? At Wendy's? How did that happen.   5) the food was all kind of bland, flavorless. Lacking in the nuanced umami I have come to expect from the \"Quality is our ingredient\" mantra.   6) the dining experience is nothing more or less what I would expect from a Wendy's dining room. Nothing special though I am normally a drive through customer.   On the plus side: FINALLY a Wendy's with a decent wine list.   I give it three stars for trying but not trying hard enough."}
{"text":"Will not recommend this restaurant for Asians. The food is decent and from some points they look good, but it's not good enough if you're craving for some authentic Asian cuisine. I had tofu Napoleon and the tofu was deep fried and the dish was made with very American-Chinese sweet and sour sauce."}
{"text":"The quality of the food was pretty bad. Especially when you consider the price and atmosphere. It's unfortunate because everything else about the restaurant was top notch! The service, the decor, the aesthetic/plating of the dishes. Our waiter was friendly and we were well taken care of, but what matters the most to me at a restaurant is how the food tastes. And it wasn't good. The chef cared more about how it looked than how it would taste. It was all pretty flavorless. For appetizers, we had dumplings, chicken satay (the sauce was green which I've never seen before and tasted like nothing). My boyfriend had a mee goreng that belonged in a Chinese food stand on the side of a street topped with a large chunk of tomato... why? My entree was salmon coconut curry. I can cook salmon better at home. The mix of vegetables was not complementary, the curry was too thick and coagulated by the end of the meal. The dish came with egg noodles and the waiter had asked what kind of rice I wanted when he took my order. I didn't think about it when he asked but when the dish arrived and I realized I had noodles and rice on my plate I was confused... one thing I did love was the sake mojito! So there's that."}
{"text":"I'm a slacker about reservations, so going in on Feb 13th, I shouldn't have been surprised it was booked.  We sat at the bar, and let me enthusiastically recommend this option to everyone - the service was fast, fantastic and the food was just as good as the first couple times my husband and I went."}
{"text":"GREAT SUSHI AT GREAT PRICES! AFFORDABLE AND TASTY PAN ASIAN EATERY!  So - long story short - some of our best friends invested in this place and help run day to day operations. They are an ethnic Chinese couple who grew up in Vietnam. They are wonderful cooks with rich culinary backgrounds and really put a lot of effort into this new place along with several other Asian American business folks in the area.  The eatery is Pan Asian so they try to touch on a several different flavors throughout Asian Cuisine including Indian and Thai. And the real show stopper is their sushi! One of their head sushi chefs comes from such notables haunts as Nobu - so it's no surprise their are some really great sushi rolls to be had. My fav is the Dixie Chicken Roll and the Rock and Roll. When I'm no longer pregnant I will work my way through all the cooked and non cooked rolls!  What the owners have stressed here is the reality of the neighborhood. This former Richard Chen's space is now a more relaxed affordable place that people can make their own and hang out at. Instead of the Richard Chen's bank buster - here you can afford to come once a week and have sushi and not break the bank. Understanding your audience is key to success and at Plum I think they understand that better than Richard Chen's.  We had nearly every dessert they make and all the ice creams are excellent. Apparently they did retain the old pastry chef from Richard Chen's so your gonna find really inventive and thoughtful desserts here. Definitely save the room!!!!!!!!  Plum does lunch and take out as well - so think about stopping in to sample more during different times of the day."}
{"text":"Food was okay... Not amazing by any means. The food looked really good online and in pictures but tasted fairly bland and not particularly impressive in person. The yellowtail jalapeño was stale and fishy. We actually had to send it back. I honestly would avoid sashimi here and just stick to the cooked food. I think I like Soba better in all honesty."}
{"text":"Echoing the sentiment of the 12/29 reviewer, I am mystified as to why a restaurant that has so much going for it - delicious food and drink, lovely decor and ambience, a great location with ample, free garage parking - would let poor service so mar the dining experience.  I ate here last night with a group of 6 friends.  We had a reservation and were seated at the first table near the entrance. We started with a round of drinks.  I had the Oh So Gingerly which pairs ginger with Maker's Mark.  They were all great, though took perhaps 20 minutes to arrive.  We shared a few appetizers, which were delicious, often served with sauces that complemented them quite well, though one plate failed to appear (and did not until we asked about it later, finally coming with our dinners).  We continued to eat, wondering if we could get water refills, seeing managers and servers walk by over and over without stopping.    Finally, 1.5 hours in, appetizers long gone, we were able to place our dinner orders.  When the dishes arrived, I confirmed with the man distributing the plates that mine was what I had ordered - \"Mee Goreng?\" and he said that it was.  Several bites in, my friend and I realized that we were eating each other's meals.  Again, everything was delicious, but we always seemed to need to flag someone down to proceed to the next stage of the meal.  Of course, being rushed is no fun either, and to be fair, we were a group of friends enjoying each other's company and not in any particular hurry, but it became quite frustrating. At one point we wondered if our server had finished for the night, because we did not see him for so long.   The dessert menu, too, is full of a variety of tasty things impeccably presented.  All our selections were enjoyed.  Our check came with an 18% gratuity added, and it was nice to not to have to think about how to tip for the good food we'd had, and the spotty service.  There is a lot of potential here, and hopefully the staff will refine their approach.  P. S. This is petty, but I also can't trust any place that does their menu in Comic Sans."}
{"text":"Come to Pittsburgh once a month for work so colleague from here suggested I try this place. I ordered the shrimp wonton and the rendang chicken curry. I enjoyed it. Not many places offer this dish so I really enjoyed it. My colleague order the beef rendang and said it was bit tough to eat."}
{"text":"We come here for sushi happy hour from time to time or dinner. It's decent sushi that isn't exorbitantly priced which is nice. It isn't *cheap* though. The service is good, and they have a lot of stuff that's less traditional, which I like. The honey walnut chicken is AMAZING. It's never terribly busy, but that's good because there isn't a huge wait."}
{"text":"Perfect date spot right in the middle Highland and Centre Ave, Plum Pan Asian Kitchen (Plum for short) is impressively decorated in modern décor and lighting. Plum is a must try in the East Liberty/Shadyside area! The sushi was fantastic and it was a lovely night for my girlfriend and I. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place only gets 2 stars because their sushi was decent. else everything else was a bit disappointing.... I went there for dinner last night with a friend because we had been dying to try out their food since last year but never had the chance to.  We went around 7pmish and it was pretty quiet inside. The restaurant was only half full and most of the patrons were much older than us (we are college students!)  We ordered the Tiffany Roll and Rock and Roll which are two of the 15 specialty rolls they offer and for entrée we ordered the Kiew Wan curry (Thai green curry) and chicken pad thai.   After what felt like an eternity our food was finally brought to us. It was a bit annoying considering the fact that the restaurant was no where close to being full and I would hate to imagine what service would be like on a day that the restaurant was busier!  following the sushi our entree's arrived. This is where the meal took a turn for the worse. The curry was really watery and lacked flavor while the pad thai was THE WORST i have ever tasted in my life. I have tried Pad thai at a good deal of the thai/asian-fusion restaurants around the squirrel hill/oakland area and this pad thai hands down wins the award for being flavorless and disgusting. I even asked the waitress for some extra sauce of any kind to try and salvage the dish but the combinations of some random chili oil thing + siracha red rooster sauce couldn't do anything to save this helpless dish.   My friend and i both agreed that if we were to ever come again (highly doubt it) we would stay far far far away from the entree stuff and stick with their specialty rolls.  seriously though, STAY AWAY FROM THE PAD THAI! if you are craving some go to Silk Elephant or Bangkok Balcony in Squirrel HIll or Typhoon which is in the same neighborhood as Plum."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for a light dinner the other night. The atmosphere is nice here with the ability to enjoy your food and company. I liked this vibe compared to other higher end Asian food places I have been where they try to turn tables as quick as possible and you feel rushed. Wait staff was average but fine.   Food wise was priced on the higher end but the ginger salad was very good, fresh lettuce and good dressing. The dumplings were not great and my friend and I did not finish our order we split. I also had the chicken endive lettuce boats which were just okay.  There are reserved parking spots for Plum in the garage attached to the building which is a plus since parking can be a pain in that area.   Overall I'd go back and try something else but this wouldn't be my top choice for Asian style food."}
{"text":"I can only write a review on the sushi because that's all I've ever gotten here. I've been on a temporary assignment in East Liberty for work for about 5 months now. One day I was craving sushi so I used Yelp to find nearby places that have sushi for lunch. I've always heard great things about Plum, but have never been, so I decided to try it. I ordered the Lucky 7 Maki Combo for lunch. I got the spicy tuna roll and shrimp tempura roll. I believe the other options are California, avocado and cucumber and maybe one other roll. You can choose the two that you want. It also came with a side of miso soup. I seriously love their sushi! I get the exact same thing every time I order lunch. Every time I go, I've had experienced great customer service. My sushi is so fresh and delicious! I get sushi there every couple weeks and it never disappoints. One day I would love to actually sit in the restaurant because it looks so beautiful inside the dining area. I've only ever gotten take out for lunch. I'm definitely a fan of Plum and will keep going back! :)"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Plum. I've been there twice, and I think they did a nice job on the decor. The location is great, and last night we had a waiter named Kevin who we loved. But the bill was high ($96 with tip) for what we got: a tuna \"martini\" appetizer (very good), black cod in a clay pot (also very good), and asparagus and shiitake mushrooms with tofu (very bland, and arrived cold). Granted we had 3 glasses of wine (total), but I still feel like it wasn't worth the hit on the wallet. The sad reality for Plum is that one could order a much tastier version of this meal elsewhere for a lot less."}
{"text":"I give it more of a 3.5 stars. Overall, I am a fan. It's a nice restaurant, to spend a special evening, or take guests to. The ambiance and decor are lovely. The cocktails I like better than the food, and my experiences with the food have always been good. I have not tried anything other than their sushi, but from companions I've dined with there, they were happy their dishes. Namely the mee goreng, and the duck medallions.  The sushi rolls are delicious. The most delicious thing I've had there though, is the uni with a quail egg on top. The zen garden cocktail is my favorite, and when they do have real lychees, they are able to make my favorite, lychee martini. I have noticed it takes a while for food to come out, but that's when zen or a lychee come in handy."}
{"text":"I was impressed with this place!  I just moved back to Pittsburgh after living in LA for a while, so I definitely appreciate good Asian food, which is hard to find in Pittsburgh.  The food here was delicious!  We started with some sushi appetizers and shared a few different entrees, which were all great!  The atmosphere was great!  I would definitely come back to try other items on the menu and hang out here!  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"On a Friday evening after some difficult searching for restaurants with available tables, two friends and I lucked out by finding spots at the bar in Plum.  It couldn't have worked out better - Nancy, the bartender, was wonderful and friendly.  One of the persons in my party had never tried sushi and Plum quickly turned him onto it, as we ordered five various (and delicious!) rolls.  The food, drinks, and service were all wonderful... as was the atmosphere and energy and aesthetics"}
{"text":"We went to Plum for the first time a few days ago. We got the double delight and the General Tso's shrimp.  Both of them were pretty good, and the appetizers were good too.  It has a really good atmosphere, and the stuff is friendly.  I would recommend checking it out if you've never been before."}
{"text":"I've been to Plum several times and am always impressed with their menu, sushi and ambiance. It's a wonderful location to catch up with friends as it can be a little noisy.   The last time I went I asked the waiter if the Marilyn Mon Roll could be deep fried (deep fried sushi is amazing, trust me). When I got the bill, I was charged $3.00 to deep fry the roll. Are you kidding me? I could've taken my plate to McDonalds down the road and they would've deep fried it for free. Not only is charging to deep fry something outrageous, the waiter never mention nor was it listed in their menu that it would be an additional charge. I paid it and decided I wouldn't return if the wait staff can't communicate the cost of what you're purchasing if it's not listed on the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is great, the drinks are delicious and the wait staff is excellent. The last time I  was there with my daughters, it was after a bad experience at another restaurant and it totally changed my day. I recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Asian food."}
{"text":"I used to love Plum! It was my go-to place in Pittsburgh with really fresh fish, a decent wine list, and a nice ambiance. But something I happened the last couple of times I was there! I was there last Sat night and noticed that the sushi has gone seriously downhill- fish not fresh - seriously not fresh. And what was once a reliably bountiful yummy salad was now a sad, meager, wilted salad. The place was chaotic- open tables but lots of people waiting around for tables. My bartender was the only bright spot- he was apologetic about the general chaos and disorganization and did his best to compensate with wine and sympathy.   But my dear Plum please reverse whatever changes you have made - whether it be with fish suppliers, chefs, or management! I want the old you back!"}
{"text":"I recently had my birthday dinner here and had a lovely meal with a large group of people.  They have tables that fit up to 12 people together which was quite perfect.   I ordered vegetable chow fun and the vegetable pineapple fried rice, both were decent.  I sort of wish I had tried the basil black cod which sounded delicious but I wish it wasn't battered and fried.  My friend tried the thai spicy duck which was tasty although a little rich with the fatty duck and the heavy sauce of the dish.   The food here is nothing extraordinary and not the best value for what it is but you are really coming here for the beautiful interior and the atmosphere.  They invested a lot of money into designing and constructing this restaurant for a place in Pittsburgh; I love that they have high ceilings.  If I had the disposable income I would come here often for sushi!  For now I'm happy with getting my raw fish fix in Oishii Bento in Oakland where they have great fresh sushi at a sweeter price point.    The service wasn't the best and 18% gratuity was automatically added onto the check as our party was 6 or larger.  They have a coat check and a smallish bar by the entrance."}
{"text":"Visited on 2.8.2018.  First and last visit to this place.  I didn't have the sushi, but based on the quality of the lettuce boats and deep fried spring rolls, I will not be back.  Stopped in for a quick appetizer since we had an early dinner planned this evening.  We only ordered three items:  1.  Lettuce Boats w/ chicken - Tasteless mush on bitter endive.  The endive was right and fresh, but the chicken mixture on top had the consistency of mashed potatoes and absolutely no taste. 2.  Deep Fried Spring Rolls - These are so hard to screw up, but essentially they tasted like overused fryer oil.   3.  Shrimp Wonton Soup - This was excellent.  The only item which really shined.  Service & Decor - The place does have very good service and decor.  Dress nice, it's a little \"bougie\".  3.2.2018 - Update:  Decided to update this review and lower it to one star. I will never go back, so no reason to give any hope for this place. It's overpriced and it sucked."}
{"text":"It's a cool looking place, the food is average, and the service is great.  The breakdown: - Ambiance (3 stars) - super cool looking, but eerily quiet. Could have used some music. It was also incredibly cold. - Service (4 stars) - excellent, spot on, very accommodating. - Sushi (3 stars) - good, fresh. Above average but not impressive. - Pad Thai (2 stars) - first of all, it was served with a lemon wedge in lieu of a lime wedge - WTF? I expect this at asian restaurants in rural areas, but in a hip neighborhood of Pittsburgh this is blasphemous. It was also missing the been sprouts, cilantro, and green onion. It wasn't greasy though. - Salad with Ginger Dressing (2 stars) - oh how I love that ginger dressing! This one, however, was a poor example. The ginger content was very low and lacked flavor - perhaps it was pre-made from Sysco?  This is probably a great place to take your business associates who aren't very well versed in Asian cuisine or who value looking cool more than enjoying life. It's all very Americanized and even the most uncultured fat-tard of the group will be able to find something on the menu they recognize which will be served in an absurdly huge portion. When combined with the hip decor this may make them feel like their cock is sufficiently large enough to engage in reasonable business negotiations, and therefore allow you to accomplish your goals. This is really the only reason I can think of to return to this establishment."}
{"text":"I've been to Plum a few times and most recently during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week. The food at Plum is good but nothing I would go raving to friends about. It has nice ambiance, with candles on the table and mood lighting. The last time we went, we had a fantastic waiter who was very attentive and really engaged with us. I'm less enthused about the prices, even when we went for Restaurant Week. Overall, I would say Plum is a nice restaurant and you won't be disappointed, though I prefer Soba (on Ellsworth) for pan-Asian food in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Came here during a weekend visit, and was mildly disappointed. Things started off well. We ordered edamame and shrimp egg rolls. You can't really mess up edamame and the egg rolls were good...loved the sauces they came with.  Also, i a few really tasty cocktails...so nice job there.  The ladies with me ordered pad thai and a fried shrimp dish. I ordered of the appetizer menu for lunch, a seaweed salad topped with seared tuna. and our food took FOREVER to come out. Several parties were sat, ate and left before our food arrived. The waiter assured us it was coming and almost an hour later, it finally did. The food was good, but an hour?? It was not busy. And although the waitstaff apologized, they didn't offer anything for our wait. I think we were too nice. I f i lived in the area i MIGHT come back because its a nice place to get a healthy meal...but for that wait? i think not!"}
{"text":"Self proclaimed sushi snob here!  Having lived in SoCal, and traveling monthly to Japan for business, I've become quite a connoisseur of fresh sushi, and immediately recognize quality.  After trying several area sushi restaurants, none of them compare to Plum for quality and freshness. We eat here at least twice per week!  The sushi is very fresh, and the sushi chefs are masters of their trade.  Typically, we just have sushi, but have had some of the cooked food, like Pad Thai and Pineapple Rice which is all very good.   Prices are a little on the higher side for Pittsburgh, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Service was slow. It took 1.75 hours for service and meal. The order was net correct by several items. The check was incorrect as well. Miso soup was like warm and hot food was cold. Not worth the money!"}
{"text":"You know your standard Chinese menu?... now imagine if someone actually tried to make those dishes REALLY WELL, throw in solid sushi and decent cocktails and BOOM you have Plum. The atmosphere is next level...but all this isn't cheap, your going to pay for it. Originally, the space opened as Chen's, roughly 14 years ago, the only contemporary fine dinning Asian menu in the city.  Pittsburgh wasn't ready.  Chen's closed after a couple years. It reopened as Plum (about 9 yrs ago) with bigger portions and more traditional dishes to satisfy the pale Yinz'er palate. .......I FEEL [deep breath] that Pittsburgh, and especially the east end, is ready for a more \"Chen like\" menu. Even if Plum did more contemporary specials, or redid the menu a bit, which i don't think it has done in a looooong time, I'd be for it.  Chen's was early by 10 yrs...come back Asian fine dinning...we're ready now."}
{"text":"Terrific atmosphere, creative appetizers, great sushi bar and service.  Salmon tataki was awesome."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Plum.  It's decorated really nicely and looks unique.  I had the pineapple fried rice and I enjoyed it - i would get it again.  My boyfriend had the walnut chicken but it wasn't as sweet as he is used to - it had a typical brown sauce instead of the sweet white sauce like most other places put on walnut chicken.  I think he was disappointed in it.  I also ordered tea (Bombay Chai) while I was there because I was freezing (will winter ever end?!) and it was amazing! Although really expensive ($4 for enough for 2 cups!). They serve Tea Forte teas which is a more expensive tea brand ($1/teabag) so I can see why they're charging that.... but if they're buying the tea in bulk they should be able to offer it for $2 or $3 and still make a good profit on it.   My only major complaint was that the waiter seemed really distracted, confused, or just plain didn't care to be there. Hopefully it was just an off night for him."}
{"text":"Friendly staff greeted us for a lunch expedition at Plum so that was a good start.  The ambiance is very modern and you can see the Asian influences in the color palettes being used.  I had their spicy orange chicken dish and it was delightful.  The sauce was savory and had enough of a kick to make you reach for the glass of water but not enough to hide the rest of the flavors.  Both the protein and the veggies were cooked properly and neither's texture was sacrificed in the cooking process for their dish mates.  Perhaps it is my gluttony or perhaps the serving style, but I thought I could have used a little more white rice.  Pricing was in the high-end for lunches, there's definitely cheaper options in the area and in the cuisine genre.  But for a once in a while option I can definitely see myself returning to Plum for lunch."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. When we came in the hostess and servers were very nice and friendly and quickly sat us. The service was good. But the food could have been much better. I decided to go after i saw the yelp reviews, however they not exactly meet my expectations in terms of the sushi. I am assuming because Pittsburgh is so far inland getting fresh fish must be expensive. The Sashimi entree was 31$.... no problem except the fish was cut in overly large chunks that made chewing and eating it challanging, properly served sashimi in when prepared at an authentic Japanese restaurant is served in small filéd pieces but what bothered me was the fish had an off taste to it, like it was old. I also had a yellowtail roll that tasted old. My friend had the eggplant in garlic sauce and loved it so it might just be their sushi.. the tea leaf salad was ok but having had it in both burmese and Indian restaurants , the salad here was pale in comparison   PROS Atmosphere  Service   CONS Mediocre fish Americanized versions"}
{"text":"Went there for a girls night. Great place, great service. Wait staff very helpful. Drinks and food very good. Highly recommend the apricot ginger cosmo. At the end of the night found out we were served by the manager. How cool he took the time to stay connected to his business. Very impressed!"}
{"text":"Staff was great...food was average at best.  Not much more to say..."}
{"text":"I had dinner with 2 other people at Plum on Cinco de Mayo because there was a huge wait at Mad Mex. We had no problem getting a table without a reservation and it was pretty quiet in there. I'm a vegetarian and I went with a vegan and a carnivore. We all had great meals. The service was very smooth and the atmosphere was relaxed, with nice decor. They have enough variety to satisfy any type of diet, and seating that would work well regardless if you're dining alone or with a group. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We just moved here from SoCal and we were hesitant about Sushi in P-Burgh but after reading some reviews we decided to try Plum, and wow it exceeded all expectations. We have lived here for 1 month and have eaten at Plum 3 times (It's that good). The sushi is on par and the service is exceptional (that's rare) We have had the pleasure of meeting Jason (restaurant manager) a couple of times and he is a true asset to that company. I would steal him for my own if I had one...  The sushi is great, the pineapple fried rice was very tasty and the singapore noodles were light and flavorful. My husband and I have traveled extensively through Asia and we are very lucky to have found this great place to get quality food here in Pittsburgh. Whoever is reading this, you gotta check them out. You will love it!!"}
{"text":"Great Asian dishes, good presentation and value for money for lunch . Especially after our family rip off at Sakura."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad. It wasn't good. It was a-ok.  The ambiance was nice - made me feel as though I was in New York City. When I realized I looked like a classy hobo, I knew that wasn't true anymore.  Since this was my first time, I ordered the Simply Cashew with chicken. It sounded simple and tasted... simple. I also split a couple of sushi rolls with my boyfriend and they were awful. I'm always hesitant about ordering sushi from a place that offers a variety of Asian food. Honestly, I would've been happier eating sushi from Giant Eagle.  I decided to cheer myself up with a Pomegranate Martini. It was delicious. Definitely a bit tart but I think that's why I enjoyed it so much. You could hardly taste the alcohol, but it definitely packed a punch towards the end.  For dessert (of course I had to have some), I ordered two scoops - one of green tea and one of red bean ice cream. That was also fabulous.  To sum it up, I would've been happy if I stuck with drinks and dessert. Again, I wasn't impressed with the food, but if I had to dine there again, I would give it another shot."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, very chic and modern. Plum has a very cute small bar in the front that is great while waiting for your table. Also, coming from Boston it's nice to know Pittsburgh is FINALLY getting some sushi places that are good!  My friends and I ordered some wine and sushi, the wine came quickly and we waited almost an hour after that for our food. We were chatting away but also growling for some food! It was very odd. The waitress seemed slow and disinterested. The host was a very fast, polite man but this waitress was weird. She told me they made my sushi wrong and then I just waited longer than my friends.   Either way, the sushi was great! I got a Spicy Salmon Roll (which was about 6 pieces and delicious!) And a Skinny Roll that was SO good! Marinated veggies with slivered avocado on top! So delicious!   I would definitely go back, interesting menu with asian fusion of thai too. Nice atmosphere. Good date place. Just hopefully get a different server than we did! Also, very convienent parking right upstairs in Borders! Very nice.   When I'm in town next I'll come back and try more!"}
{"text":"The service was decent but the Chinese food was really bad. I can't comment on the sushi."}
{"text":"I was very excited to go to Plum, as they have clear dietary markings and a separate vegan menu, and all of their dishes sound so wonderful!  My boyfriend and I went last night, and the atmosphere and service was  excellent. I ordered one of their specials that night, the \"Tofu Napoleon.\" The description listed it as vegan with a long list of veggies (asparagus, eggplant, bok choy, shiitake, etc), so I was sold. It was my mistake to have expected a larger quantity of veggies from the extensive description, but the dish came with about one of each vegetable listed. The sauce tasted like a very sweet duck sauce, and the tofu was very fried (although tasty). Overall, it was a tasty but small amount of food, and the sauce was nothing spectacular for the $16 price. My stomach was also a bit upset later from the uber fried-ness of the tofu, but I might just be sensitive...  I will definitely go again, but will order something different next time. Looking forward to trying other vegan options at Plum!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in this restaurant.  I ordered brown rice and received white rice.  My egg rolls were soggy and the entrees were bland.  I am really confused by the reviews on here, because this place seems to be hit or miss..."}
{"text":"Not my favorite sushi place in the East End, but I enjoy going here for Happy Hour. The sushi rolls are discounted, and the cocktails are creative and fun.  For entrees, try the black cod. So tender and juicy. Delicious."}
{"text":"Went in with a big group and would quickly recommend this place to anyone asking \"Where can we get a reservation for 10 and it won't be a pain in the ass?\"  Lots of parking in the garage (across from BRGR...and you're allowed to park there!) and the staff had no problem giving us separate checks when we let them know right up front.  The food was good, and the menu has enough variety that everybody could find something they wanted.  I'm not a sake aficionado, but the table ordered a few carafes and passed them around which was fun and they were tasty.  They had a nice drink menu and the cocktails looked good -- wish they had a bit more of a wine selection, but it was fine.  One weird thing:  The chairs are too short for the tables."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad meal yet. LOVE every item we've ordered-and we've ordered a variety. The Black Cod, the Salmon, and Pineapple Fried Rice were our most recent dishes.  LOVE the GREEN-TEA-NI! It was one of the best Martinis I've had....ever!  The sushi is always SO fresh and such a nice variety.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is totally tofureffic!    Coming off of a weekend of epic tofu fail (when it calls for extra-firm, just do it. Don't tempt tofu fate) I was in the need of a few tasty tofu bites.  And I got what I asked for last night at Plum.  For some reason I expected a casual dining atmosphere.  Maybe it was the outdoor seating that has taunted me daily as I passed by, but needless to say - not that casual a place.  Of course it's no LeMont either, so don't let that put you off.  It's just a lovely place...made me realize I probably hang out in dumps far too often.  I ordered the Tofu Basil Stirfry, upon the recommendation of our very friendly server (Kevin, I think?).  He was absolutely right - the basil flavor bursted forth from each succulent piece of delicious tofu.  Complemented by an array of very fresh, very snappy vegetables and the most flavorful brown rice I've had the pleasure to not leave on my plate, this is one dish I'll certainly order again and again.  My guest ordered the pork loin, which was equally delicious though not as hot (temperature)  - odd, considering our food came out in less than 5 minutes.  No joke - FIVE minutes.  So do yourself a favor and leave your hilarious t-shirt and distressed jeans at home.  Throw on something decent and enjoy a much-more-than-decent meal at my new favorite pan asian Pittsburgh place!"}
{"text":"I have to state upfront that I am not a fan of Asian cuisine.  However, I was convinced to try this place which seemed to be nice.  We went on a Wednesday night and the place was not very crowded.  The ambiance is great and the service fast and helpful.  The plate I got (the Vietnamese pork) was nice (maybe a bigger Asian kitchen fan would have found it awesome).  In general I would not be so negative going back to it and trying a different dish as well."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of having lunch here with my yelp buddy, Lisa G. and her well-mannered little guy last week.  I took vacation during restaurant week so I could purposely try different places.  Though Plum wasn't participating in Restaurant week, it has been on my list of places I MUST try.  This area of Shadyside is booming with restaurant activity and shopping places so it was quite a treat to find a parking lot above the restaurant for free!    We arrived there shortly before 1pm, and there were only a handful of people dining at this time.  It was very quiet inside.  The place had an echo to it, however the décor and the setup was lovely.  I did feel the urge to keep my voice down as it seemed to travel all threw the place.    To start we ordered drinks.  The waitress was very sweet to my friends son, and made his little drink to his exact specifications.  Gotta love a man who knows what he wants:) I ordered an Asian Sangria.  I am not sure what makes it Asian but it was yummo.  Very refreshing, but a little on the pricey side.     For lunch I ordered octopus sushi a la carte, and Shrimp Pad Thai which I requested be prepared spicy at a level 8.  I can say I actually found a sushi I wasn't thrilled over.  Don't get me wrong it was fresh, I just didn't dig the octopus the way I thought I would.  But it sure made a pretty picture.  My Pad Thai was pretty good, but not really spicy.  The waitress recommended another dish since I requested spicy but I stuck to the Pad Thai.  I love when the staff recommends things, I probably should have listened.  I look forward to returning hopefully for dinner next time, oh and next time here I am going all sushi baby!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the neighborhood and was hoping to find my  neighborhood spot for good but not-too-pricey sushi.  I went for lunch and my appetite got the better of me, so I ordered the green curry with chicken instead.  The curry was excellent including fresh and crunchy peppers and large chunks of eggplant.  The sauce had a delicate flavor.  My kind of curry.  The portion was enough for me to make at least 2 lunches out of it, so I brought the rest home.  The service was friendly, professional, and quick.  It exceeded my expectations in every way for a restaurant that tries to cover many types of Asian food.  I will definitely be coming back and hopefully next time will try the sushi too!"}
{"text":"It is a delighting place!  The restaurant is an elegant and refined Pan Asian restaurant, the cleanliness, great service and well organized areas make this place so special. Food is fresh and cooked to perfection, I enjoyed the flavor tour and magnificent experience their personnel recommended me to take, it was amazing.   I thank Andrew and Nadia for taking care on me with their recommendations and full explanation of the dishes, their guidance made me to choose the dish I really wanted. Special and double thanks to Mark for his outstanding attention.  I have been there five times and all of them had been perfect experiences, definitely this is the place to go in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I used to like pretty much! Just the last time I didn't enjoyed so much because I saw a yellow hair in my cloth napkin, I felt bad... The price is fair."}
{"text":"This review should really be 2.5 stars.  It's a slick atmosphere, with mediocre food.  Not bad, mind you, but not memorable.  I ordered a veggie tofu dish with brown rice.  Simple, right?  The veggies were nice.  The rice was kind of crusty around the edges.  The tofu, however, was the deal breaker: deep fried to a rubberized texture.  I gather they may be better with other dishes, but I'm not planning to run back to Plum."}
{"text":"As someone who doesn't like most Asian food I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food here. I came here last week with a fellow yelper (shout out to Carrie W.) for lunch. The place was a bit empty and oddly quiet. There was no music just the hushed whispers of the few other diners that there there. The dining area has high ceiling and is very minimalist in a good way. To drink I had thai iced tea. It was a bit to sweet but the flavor of the tea itself was nice and strong but overpowered by the sweetness. Our waitress was also more then happy to make my son some red lemonade and even put some cherries in it for him. To start I choose the chicken skewers. The seasoning on the chicken was tasty but the chicken itself I found dry. The peanut sauce was very flavorful but a bit to oily for my liking. My boy had a hand full of bites before he said he was done and just wanted to eat his peanut sauce. For my main course I had thai basil chicken. It was very good. The chicken was moist and the basil was fresh as were the peppers and onion in it. The veggie spring roll that came with it was crispy and delicious. I wish the chicken skewers would have came out first but all the food pretty much came out at the same time. The service was good and I never found myself wanting or waiting. Over all this was a great lunch and I'm sure it would make a great place for a dinner date."}
{"text":"After driving around this corner so many times and seeing the place look fairly crowded I was looking forward to trying it, although I really had no idea what to expect.  Who knew I'd find really good sushi at decent prices in Pittsburgh?  I certainly didn't think so, but I was wrong.  The food was good, service was good (although we got there right when it opened for dinner) and were very pleased.  I would definitly go back."}
{"text":"I love this place. They're always able to accommodate large parties quickly and are super friendly + welcoming. Not to mention the food is excellent and diverse. It's nice that they serve a combination of American-Asian, Sushi, Chinese, Thai, etc. so the whole group can find something they like. Their staff is exemplary- the servers are what every server should aspire to be, esp Nadia and Gabe; and their manager, Mark, really goes out of his way to make you feel welcome.   We go their regularly, but recently went for a birthday celebration and they went above and beyond to make it special. They made an extra hot meal with Ghost Pepper for a friend, decorated some cheesecakes with sauce and candles, ice cream, pictures, the works! Great service all around."}
{"text":"Only reviewing the bar area - as we only had a glass of wine/ cocktail and an appetizer. The bar tender was lovely and willing to entertain making us 'different' drinks. The pork won-tons were ok, but I think i was just expecting less of a hunk of meat in them. All-in-all, a nice place for a little happy hour."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with two friends.   We had sushi, general tso's chicken, soup (miso and won ton) and egg rolls.  Nothing adventurous or particularly \"special.\"    The food was okay, about what you'd expect.  A bit TOO straightforward for the prices.   You can get the same quality from other local \"storefront\" asian restaurants.    The service, however, was HORRIBLE.   We had to ask for soy sauce for the sushi.  Never offered chopsticks.   Had to request refills on the drinks.  My friend's diet soda was flat.  Our server took our orders and then disappeared; we had to flag down other staff to handle our requests.  And those requests took far too long to be fulfilled.    They were, however, very quick to drop the bill on the table and return with the charge slip.    The restaurant was NOT busy.   We were very confused by the poor service.    There's so many OTHER good pan-asian restaurants in Pittsburgh that provide better value for the money and certainly offer far better service.  I'm not sure how these folks will distinguish themselves and stay in business."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to go for some sushi with friends after 7 months of being in Pittsburgh.  Nice atmosphere.  NOW THE DOWN SIDE!  Took 30 mins to be seated (not such big deal),  took forever getting drinks, then we noticed  people that came in after us were getting their orders and the place was starting to clear out.  Mind you, this is 35 minutes after being seated and placing our order.  So, I ask the waitress  \"um...so yeah is our order ready yet?\"  Her response \"they're making the sushi.\"  The manager comes and checks on our table.  Why?  He pretty much blew us off.  Another 25 minutes goes by.  Forget it!  Cancel my order!  The next thing ya know...here comes our food.  ARE YOU SERIOUS!   They still charged us for the appetizers/drinks.  Won't go back!  I'm mailing the owner a nice little letter about my experience...ugh!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say I've never had worse service at a restaurant in Pittsburgh than I did at Plum Pan Asian Kitchen. We had a reservation for 6 PM  on a week day and when we arrived and throughout our entire meal, the restaurant was pretty much empty. Both my husband and I ordered chicken dishes for dinner and I ordered a sushi roll as an appetizer. It took an entire hour to get our sushi roll. There was no reason to wait that long for a sushi roll in a dead restaurant. Then, 20 minutes or so later, nearly 1.5 hours since we were seated, we were served our meals. It was totally unacceptable. 45 minutes after we were seated, another group of 4 came in and they were served their meals before us. How does that even happen? Beyond the slow food service, our waitress was just very slow in general. She didn't seem like she was all there and very well could have been under the influence of something because she just seemed really zoned out. It was one of those instances where we gave our card to pay as soon as she brought the bill because we couldn't risk her disappearing for 20 minutes again and we were so desperate to leave. I won't be eating here ever again."}
{"text":"I enjoy Plum, but this doesn't get a higher rating from me because the last couple times I have been, I sat outside and the wait was horrible. Not only to get appetizers and entrees, but water or drink refills too. Both occasions it took 2 hours for 2 people who ordered drinks, apps to share and entrees. Otherwise, I enjoy the food and sushi is good, just wish my food would one quicker."}
{"text":"A great place to take your Pittsburgh-rich suburban parents for some crowd-pleasing but not particularly inventive Asian fusion fare."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends on a weeknight. (Although we made reservations, I don't think that was necessary).  The atmosphere is lovely, modern but not cold. The sushi was very good though a little pricey. I wasn't a huge fan of the chicken rendang but perhaps I should've gotten the traditional beef instead. I would also echo others' sentiments that the service is slow but I've only been there once.  Still, I really like this place for its relatively unpretentious but somewhat fancy atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had the unfortunate luck of experiencing a mindless hostess and poor service in my last visit.  With so many better fine dining and non-fine dining options in the area (for better \"pan-asian\" nearby, try Soba+Umi), there's no point in returning here again."}
{"text":"So pretty inside and such good value for their lunch prices. Their hot and sour soup you get with lunch is delicious! Great sushi too. Friendly service and super elegant and chic on the inside"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch at Plum recently and we didn't realize that it was approaching the time when the restaurant closed after lunch. We have eaten there many times. The waiter was pleasant and aimed to please. The soup was served promptly and it was wonderful. Then the sushi was delayed. We wished the sushi had come before the soup though. We couldn't figure out what the issue was because we clearly saw the sushi chef when we came in. We then waited 15 minutes for the sushi. Our waiter removed our bowls and then asked us if we wanted our sushi before our meal. We said yes.. . of course. Then another young man, (who was not the chef) came out and made our sushi. The uni was okay. The hamachi and the tuna was mediocre at best. Not like other times when we visited. When we were finished with the sushi, our waiter told us the kitchen was closing and asked did we want our food right away because it would get cold if we didn't take it right away. We could see that he was in a difficult position, so we said sure. We felt rushed and disappointed. I wish they had told us that the kitchen was closed instead of seating us. My husband says we won't go back there again. It was not the waiter's fault. But they weren't busy and they could have treated us better."}
{"text":"Came here again for dinner.  Again everything was really good.  Service has improved from before, and even then it was solid.  There is a fried calamari dish that is better than any I have ever eaten.  The Fatty Salmon sashimi remains amazing.   There is a dragon/lobster sushi roll special that a friend ordered that was great--but a bit difficult to eat.  Every dish was good to great; there was no one in our party of seven who gave any of the dishes a thumbs down."}
{"text":"Solid 4-star place. Went for lunch with people from work and ordered two sushi rolls. Both were delicious. An appetizer courtesy of the sushi chef was also amazing. Not the most expensive restaurant out there."}
{"text":"What has happened to Plum? Not only have my husband and I had dinner there on numerous occasions, I also lunch there twice a month.  Last night , our dinner was a disaster. Our server was very nice, but he got nothing correct.  My husband ordered a few appetizers which he requested to be staggered . Unfortunately,  they all came out at once. Also, he ordered 2 of the same apps and each was completely different. I had the red curry w/pork which I always order and it lacked several ingredients which it always has. All night, everything seemed to be out of sync. It's going to be a long time until we return."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Plum for a while now and finally gave it a try this past Sunday. They have an adorable outdoor patio that I was hoping to sit at, but it was raining off and on. Upon entering I noticed how bright and modern the interior was. We were the only ones in the restaurant which was kinda cool. I am really loving this whole Asian Fusion style of restaurants lately. Options are key these days and Plum really gives you plenty off Asian options (Chinese, Japanese and Thai). My mom and I have a tradition that we always go out to eat together on Sundays. She was really craving noodles and decided to order Pork Pad Thai ($13). I was really wanting Chinese so I ordered the Kung Pao ($15) which came with chicken, bell peppers, peanuts, hot peppers and a brown spicy sauce. I also really love how their are different protein options to add to your dish (Tofu, Chicken, Beef, Shrimp, Pork or Scallops). If you are not in the mood for General Tso's Chicken, swapping it out with some Tofu is an option and like I said early, options are key! I was pleasantly surprised with how much food they give you, especially my moms Pork Pad Thai. I have been to plenty of Thai restaurants and Plum definitely gives you the most bang for your buck. Speaking of bucks, their prices are great and the quality of food is great. Win-Win!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, decor and service. But the food, the most important aspect of a dining experience for me, was pretty much a case of Asian fusion gone wrong.  There was nothing \"Beijing\" about my Beijing Pork Loin and nothing \"Thai\" about the Thai Style Duck that my companion ordered.  There was no taste to the food, let alone authenticity.   I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Let me first note that the sushi was a 5/5  I got the sushi dinner. 7 pieces of nigiri and your choice of either tuna roll or california roll (could make either spicy for no additional charge)  The tuna roll was typical, but was a pristine example of what a standard tuna roll should be. Rice packed nicely, quality tuna. I asked for the spicy sauce on the side, I wasn't crazy about it but that may be my general feeling towards most spicy sauces.  The nigiri pieces were perfect. The rice was the perfect consistency and size (bite size) the cuts of fish themselves were much more generous. The rice was actually similar to that at uni, but the pieces were larger, and no accompanying sauces. Every piece was exceptional, and the entree itself is quite a steal at $20.  The chicken satay was good, but standard. I did particularly enjoy the pickled carrots and jimica served along side. The satay sauce itself was quite good, on the sweeter side, and not much heat.   The sweet and sour soup was also very tasty, a subtle heat so that you know you're eating something spicy, but no real burn or anything close to unpleasant.  My dining companion chose the vegetable pineapple fried rice. It was tasty but nothing spectacular. More ore less a mound of rice with some broccoli, egg, cashews, and large chunks of pineapple. Good, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. A savory meat added to the dish may have made it quite a bit better though, and I definitely wouldn't object to having it as a side to an entree.  The tables at the restaurant are a bit closer than I feel comfortable with. There are about 2 feet between yourself and the next table. I could hear the conversations on either side of me in full.  Our waitress (Stephanie I believe) was very knowledgeable and accomadting.  She did not rush us in the slightest, all I could ask for from service.  Cliffs: Sushi is fantastic, and sushi combo is a hell of a deal other sampled dishes are good tables too close  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is  amazing, and the staff is even better! We got there after closing hours because it was Christmas Day and they were closing earlier.. but they received us with a smile in the face and said that we could sit down and enjoy a dinner with no rush! We were surprised since we had already gone to another place that didn't allow us to go in! We were so glad to come here because we loved the food, staff and environment! For sure the best place I've been in Pittsburgh so far!!!"}
{"text":"Oh yum! Fresh tasty fish, accomdating chef and server. Nice atmosphere. Must be a very well kept secret because this place is not packed on a friday night.  Come and taste what you are missing!!!"}
{"text":"Service is friendly but quite slow. The food, like the decor, is attractive and stylish, but except for the sushi it lacks a lot of flavor. The wonton soup is quite bland. The Kung pao chicken lacks the pizzazz found at even the average Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok so...hmm. Plum. Well. Um...I think I'm just going to keep this brief and to the point.  I decided to sit at the bar. When you're eating alone the bar is the way to go.  Service: The staff here is very stand offish. The bartender and the host were very unfriendly. I don't know if they had a bad day or what but with the host I asked hervto charge my phone for me which seemed (from the look on her face) to be more of an annoyance than anything. The bartender I don't know was either just very aloof or just it was his first day behind the bar. I dunno staff friendliness is high up on my list as far as quality service is concerned and from what I could tell neither had that quality at all.   Anywho...the food. Dear god. Bad chinese is probably better. I ordered the Roti Canai which on my first visit to Plum my god was delicious this visit it was pretty mediocre but when you're hoping that the sauce does all the work and it doesn't it can ultimately be a flop. The next item I had was the Shrimp Springrolls. VOM! I honestly don't even know how I scarfed both of them down. They left a weird after taste in my mouth which I ended up rinsing out with a glass of Riesling. Plus the sauces meh meh and even more meh. I was so underwhelmed by them that I had to have him bring me a completely different sauce all together (sauce for the dumplings). Surprisingly I tried to stick it out at plum by ordering one more small plate...BAD DECISION. (horror music) I shouldve just said anything with the word lollipop and meat together in one phrase should just be a no go. I unfortunately decided to be adventurous and go for the Lemongrass Beef Lollipops. (vomits in the background) I could barely get through one before I pushed the plate away.  I don't think ill be going back to Plum anytime soon. Seriously, Plum what happened?"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour. The food was great and they had happy hour specials. We ordered the general tso's 3 ways, spicy tuna roll, edamame, Ika...all priced well. Now the drink special for happy hour is another story. The vodka special was $6!!! Me NOT like! I wold go back for the happy hour food, but not the drinks. I recommend eat here, drink somewhere else. The place is very posh & the wait staff attentive and nice."}
{"text":"I liked the vibe here. It was a nice place and the service was good. We got sushi which seemed to have high quality fish and was good, but nothing amazing."}
{"text":"The chef was sooooooooo nice, he gave us free salad and char siu to taste!! The food was super awesome!!"}
{"text":"Very great sushi and wait staff, all very accommodating. The ambience is nice with great music and lots of natural light. The decor of the restaurant was top notch. The food was one of the best sushi rolls I've ever had (rock n roll) and the fried rice was also very good. Over all, 5 out of 5, well earned, stars."}
{"text":"My third time here but first time coming for lunch. I ordered the \"Spanking New\" sushi rolls and it was delicious. I enjoy the atmosphere and that it wasn't overly crowded. Great presentation of the food. Service was excellent like my previous experiences. I recommend. Well done, Plum."}
{"text":"Good sushi/sashimi.  A note to the restaurant-- upscale decor and high prices don't go along with the imitation crab in your sashimi sampler."}
{"text":"Ate at Plum Christmas day.  They were busy but the waiter was attentive.    Very nice decor.  I ordered the yaki udon, which was excellent.  My wife had the pad thai.  She thought it tasted very bland, and I agreed with her; so we sent it back.  Chicken satay was good, as well as my daughter's sushi (spicy tuna and spicy salmon), which she couldn't finish.    All in all a nice meal."}
{"text":"I'm starting to feel like I only write bad reviews... I'll have to fix that.  I'm not a fan.  The food was ok, but not great - and at those prices it's really not worth it.  We started with Tom Kha soup and the Roti appetizer.  The soup was okay but really under-spiced and unusually sweet for what I'm used to with this soup.  The Roti was really greasy and the dipping sauce was a kind of bland satay.  I had sushi as my entree and got their version of a  fantasy roll. The roll was cut way too big so that you kind of had to break it up into pieces or shove the whole thing in your mouth in a really ugly way.  Pretty hard to taste anything either way.  The sushi was really fresh though.  My date had the spicy thai duck and he really liked it. I'm not a huge fennel fan so I didn't like it much, but it seemed like it would be good for people who are.  The tomatoes that came alongside were nowhere close to being ripe.  The place was really crowded and felt like a cafeteria.   The service was polite but about what you'd expect at a diner, they didn't know much about the menu and had wonderful Pittsburgh accents. Cute but not professional."}
{"text":"This place would have gotten a 5-star review but there were a few mishaps throughout the night. The waitress was a bit slow and they forgot to bring out the sauces with our egg rolls, which definitely decreased the flavor/satisfactions. I was also disappointed when of the servers took away our food without asking if we were finished with it. When we ordered fried rice, which is $12, we were told we got a choice of meat (chicken, shrimp, pork). We would have been fine without meat, but we were misled into choosing a meat and the price was $15 because of it. However, the food is incredibly delicious. The fantasy roll, dragon roll, and the shrimp fried rice were great. Unfortunately, those blunders do dampen the experience, but the food was so good I can't give it less than 4 stars."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I finally got a chance to go here.  I lived in Shadyside for 6 years and it was always on my to-do list.  When I had to host an out-of-town guest, I chose this place.  I had the tom kha soup, which is sort of my benchmark dish to decide whether or not I'll be back or not. It was a tad (only a tad) sweet for my taste, but overall very good.  I then got the volcano roll which I did not realize came with a fire-y show, but was awesome nonetheless.  The volcano roll was really good too. I'll gladly return!"}
{"text":"I've never had to tell a waiter directly that I wasn't enjoying my food...I would never recommend anyone getting the Pad Thai there...I barely touched it. It was so watery with little to no real sauce mixed in. The eggs were poorly made. The vegetables weren't great either. I wouldn't recommend going there for any entrees. Maybe for the sushi? The waiter handled the situation nicely and didn't have me pay for the dish.  We waited so long for our food and the place wasn't even full as many others have said in reviews. It was disappointing and they didn't offer us a discount on the meal."}
{"text":"Sushi is always great here. This place has become a staple for great food. The ambience it's bright and romantic.  Seemed like the crowd just want there? So may restaurants are popping up in this area I really hope Plum can stay in the game!"}
{"text":"The service was slow, we were supposed to wait for a table when like 10 were available. The sushi was just ok, not impressive.  I wouldn't go back for the sushi."}
{"text":"The food was definitely better than the atmosphere. On a Friday night there were only 1/3 of the tables occupied. Which is surprising because the sushi is very good and reasonably priced. Plum is definitely not cheap but it hits the spot if you are looking for a reliable sushi spot. The location is convenient and there is available parking, which can't be said for a lot of places in the area.  Overall a good experience...would go back!"}
{"text":"We went to plum pan Asian cuisine for the first time. The decor and ambience was phenomenal. The staff was very friendly and prompt. Although the food was not extraordinary. We ordered their roti canai for appetizer. I have had this dish before at a Malaysian restaurant so I knew what to expect, although I was a little disappointed with what I got. It's basically curry made in peanuts sauce with chicken thighs and it's served with roti - their roti was excellent, it was very crisp and light and just melted in your mouth. The curry had a wonderful flavor to it although there was no chicken in it.   For entree we ordered chicken pad Thai which was just meh... overall good service and environment and average food. Will go there again for some sushi maybe."}
{"text":"I'm quite picky about my Asian fusion experiences and Plum did not make the cut. Came here to get something to go on a weekday.  Ambiance: 4/5 Though I didn't sit down to eat my lunch (as I had it to go), the ambiance inside seemed upscale. The hostess was courteous and the pick-up process was smooth.  Food: 3/5 I ordered a Una Don to go, which ended up being around $20 post-tax. The lunch menu included a miso soup. The dish itself had three gyoza, a measly portion of sushi rice, and six pieces of eel. The texture of two of my six eel pieces was too fatty for my liking, though the other four pieces were fine. The sushi rice portion was about the size of half an apple... which was really quite too small for a meal. The gyoza were not memorable. Both the gyoza and the una don were too salty, in my opinion. The miso soup was decent.  I'd probably not come back again unless I'm craving for sushi and am too lazy to go somewhere farther for it."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Pittsburgh.  Certainly in terms of overall experience.  The presentation of the sushi was incredible.  Even standard rolls (avocado) were better than I expected.  They have some really interesting speciality rolls, including one with grilled chicken (yeah..grilled chicken).    The rest of the food is good, but leaves something to be desired.  We got vegetable chow fun, which was good - but not incredible like the sushi.    I will definitely return."}
{"text":"We had a birthday celebration on a Saturday evening at Plum. Peaceful atmosphere, great service and the food was perfect. Those that are sushi loved it. The vegetable fried rice was packed full of veggies. Curtis our waiter was outstanding. A perfect place for a ladies night out."}
{"text":"Food was good. It came out quickly. The one waitress was nice but hostess was rude. Took ten minutes to be greeted and she was dismissive. Good idea to make a reservation ahead of time. Pad Thai was good, can get the same quality at a take out place. Overall average experience."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this restaurant. I've gone here before for a date night and a girls' night out, and it was perfect for both. I love the decor, very modern with a touch of world flair and pops of color.  Their cocktails are amazing. The food is great. The service is friendly. The prices are a tad bit high for me to be a frequent customer but the ambiance and quality of the place call for the price range, in my opinion.   And you certainly can't beat the free parking lot!"}
{"text":"Another great Pittsburgh venue.  Lots of great appetizers and dinner items, as well as great take-out.   ProTip: try the Bangkok Tea! ;)"}
{"text":"I went for dinner on New Years Eve. I went early, when if was not yet busy. In short, the food was terrible. My fiance and I ordered pad thai and another noodle dish, and they were flavorless, with overcooked noodles. I did order tamago from the sushi bar, which was quite good, so maybe the sushi is better? But I think this place  caters more to a bar crowd than an eating crowd.  After eating a third of the food, we got it wrapped up, paid, and walked up the block to Kanok, another Thai place where the food was absolutely delicious to the point where I ordered a second dessert."}
{"text":"Pan-asian...always a little fishy as there is no way a restaurant can be good at an entire spectrum of Asian food.  A+ for atmosphere, I love the high ceilings, unique lanterns, and wood finishing on everything.  But let's get down to what really counts--the food!  Pineapple fried rice---The first thing we noticed is that it was a SOGGY mess.  Any Asian person knows that to make good fried rice, you need day old rice.  I was kind of hoping for fresh pineapple, but of course it was canned.    Plum sushi lunch special--An assortment of fish with a roll.  Very nice presentation, not expertly put together roll but it was passable.  Tea leaf salad--A disappointment but of course I am comparing it to THE tea leaf salad from Burma Superstar in SF (and there's no comparing to that!).  Still, for what is basically just SALAD, they should not be charging 8 dollars.  Overall, what we expected from a pan-asian place.  Perhaps they do some things well and we didn't taste those dishes but we probably won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Little bit pricey but great sushi and happy hour drinks. The Thai basil mojito was so tasty, and my boyfriend's Asian sangria definitely had a delicious lychee taste to it. The edamame was cooked at that perfect time where the beans are sweet, crunchy, and salty (from added salt on top). Definitely come during happy hour if you are ordering your basic spicy tuna roll because it is a whopping $9 without happy hour making it your regular $7. The special rolls are priced what I would expect though. The south beach roll is incredible. What a fresh tasting roll it is... it certainly gives me the feeling of walking into the ocean on a warm day... meaning it even makes me feel so fresh as I eat it. They have Excellent quality fish, which you can taste in this roll since there is no rice and it is wrapped in cucumber. Finally we got the volcano roll, which is just a fun fried roll. The presentation was great. Our waiter gave us excellent service.   Update 8/4/17  Had the south beach roll, which is a cucumber wrapped roll with tuna, salmon, and avocado. Favorite roll to date again"}
{"text":"A mellow evening here with a couple of friends. Food was delicious and service was exceptional. We ordered off the small plate menu, all were shareable and the variety was great."}
{"text":"As we were sitting there on a Friday night enjoying the food, we wondered why the place wasn't busier. Then we got the bill, and our question was answered."}
{"text":"Food is typically wonderful; but note, if you come in at 2:45 for a quick lunch they'll say the kitchen has already closed; despite their hours for lunch being until 3pm. Typically if it's a matter of service ending at 3, I never come in 15 minutes before closing time; but since it's a mid shift lunch and they open for dinner later as well (4pm), this wasn't the case.  Maybe you should change your lunch advertised hours to 2:45 instead?  However, your neighbor, Patron Mexican Grill is happy to serve a late lunch to a new loyal customer."}
{"text":"The food was really good but the service was awful.  There was a 45 min wait so we sat at the bar.  There was one bartender for a room full of people, took forever to get a drink.  Then once we were seated we waited for almost a half of an hour before the waitress came to take a drink/ appetizer order.  The food was very slow and the drinks even slower. This place is poorly managed but the food is great."}
{"text":"Contrary to other reviews, we actually had superb service! The bartender for pre-dinner drinks was attentive and friendly and our waitress didn't miss beat. (Maybe they've been reading the reviews and stepped up their game!) My friends and I are all vegetarian and it always makes us so happy when none of us have to order the same thing because of lack of options. Plum lives up to its name of a Pan-Asian Kitchen - we had an Indian appetizer and Japanese, Chinese and Thai entrees. We skipped out on desert because we were just too stuffed. Classy joint and I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Nice evening weather-wise so opted to sit outside. I did get a peek inside when greeted by the host before heading outside and it is a lovely setting -- very inviting for a dinner date -- so I want to come back for that option.   The menu selections are enticing -- sushi, thai, Vietnamese, Chinese.  I decided on a mainstay of pad thai with shrimp.  It was good.  The crispy tofu was a \"different\" addition to the dish.  Can't say it was my favorite, just different.  Service was quick and efficient, albeit my server seemed a bit on the timid/shy side.  Yes, I do want to come back for dining inside and see how the entire experience will be in what appeared to be an inviting setting with some ambiance."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Nice mix of Asian, Thai, Szechuan fare. Everything is fresh and served piping hot. Our table was waiting for us and the service was excellent. I tried an Asian Sangria that was like summer in a glass.  A mango chicken dish with brown rice was truly delish!  Chased it with cocoanut sorbet.  Can't wait to sit on their patio outside this summer."}
{"text":"I really didn't want to eat here because I'm not a big fan of Pan Asian cuisine.  So my Stars are strictly based on their SUSHI   However after reading some reviews I learned that they sold sushi and since I've moved here I've been looking for decent sushi.    I have to say I think I have found my new sushi place.  But then again I haven't tried umi yet.  The sushi was very fresh and even though it was expensive by Cali standards it was more than I could have imagined.  We ordered the Pan Fried Pork Dumplings aka Potstickers and they came with a very good sauce that had ginger and soy sauce in it.  We ordered five different rolls:  Eel and avocado: which was yummy!   Cali roll with snow crab: The crab was very fresh and it didn't have a seaweed wrap it had a soy wrap with made the flavor a little different  Grilled Tuna with asparagus roll:  This roll wasn't our favorite, the fish had no flavor and fell short in flavor.    Spicy tuna: which had the perfect about of spice.  I don't remember the last one but it had shrimp tempura and spicy tuna on top.  It was well balanced in flavor and maybe my favorite one.  We also ordered dessert which was a carmel cupcake from Vanilla!! They served it with a spoon scoop of ice cream.  It was the perfect amount and didn't leave us filling full.  We might not go here every week but at least once every few months since it was very pricey.   Great service and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"My friends and I attempted to go to Spoon without a reservation and, as a result, there was a two-hour wait. As one of my friends said, I won't wait two hours for a table in Paris, why would I wait that long in Pittsburgh? With that said, we headed to Plum and, while we had to wait 30 minutes for a table, the bartender was pleasant and made us some great drinks. Once we were seated, we waited fifteen minutes before I had to seek out our waitress. Because of this, the manager treated each of us to a drink. We shared the tempura entree (which was REALLY good) and I had the pad Thai (which was not the best I have had, but certainly not the worst). The design, the bartender (Lauren?), and \"the customer is always right\" attitude won me/us over. If you want to eat here on either a Friday or Saturday night, I HIGHLY recommend a reservation."}
{"text":"We came in during dinnertime for a friend's birthday. Ambiance and service is really nice. The server communicated well with us about pricing, and even gave the birthday girl a free dessert. We just had no idea the food was going to be so horrendously mediocre at such a nice restaurant.  First of all, the corkage fee is $15... just for uncorking our wine. We thought, \"well this is a fancy restaurant we should be prepared to pay that amount.\" We opened the menu and taken aback because we only found chinese buffet dishes like general tso's, lo mein, and egg rolls.  We figured a nice restaurant like this should be giving it an unorthodox or elevated spin so we ordered the Sichuan beef tenderloin, thai basil stirfry, and wok fried broccoli. We were getting ready for the best goddamn broccoli ever.   Sichuan beef tenderloin: they just cut up and STIR FRIED the FILET MIGNON to a rubber texture. The broccoli and thai basil had the exact same sauce drowning these overcooked vegetables. It was appalling they were charging $26 for something that was identical in presentation and taste to a college student's takeout, except it was served on a porcelain plate instead of styrofoam. As asians we're not even asking for authenticity, we're just asking for quality proportional to the price, and we're begging to know who keeps coming back for ratchet chinese takeout for $26 because this place is obviously well liked at 3.5 stars.   2/10 would not recommend coming back for dinner."}
{"text":"Overpriced and overrated. My sushi wasn't big at all and very overpriced. Our wait or was not attentive at all and didn't pay any attention to us. When we asked for the check, he laughed. I thoroughly regret coming here and wasting my money."}
{"text":"The ambience was lovely with a gentle Asian fusion feel. Our server Alex was funny, cute and helpful. Most importantly the food was amazing. The club sushi roll was outstanding and my vegan friend enjoyed her tofu green curry. You really must try this place."}
{"text":"For as much as I've heard about this place I was somewhat disappointed. It was a Friday night and no one was in the restaurant. The spring rolls and pork dumplings were amazing but otherwise the service was slow. Took over 10 min each time to get drinks. I wasn't a fan of the lighting and ambience. Wouldn't go back but good food."}
{"text":"This review is only for lunch/sushi. I've heard that sushi is the way to go here. I came in with 2 coworkers, both who are vegetarian. My supervisor was buying so I didn't go overboard, but some of the specialty rolls sounded amazing. There seemed to be quite a few options with multiple types of fish. Not just a few slivers of fish and other fancy additions that rack up the price to $14. I ordered the lunch combo which was 2 rolls and a choice of soup. I started out with the shrimp won ton soup, which was a nice change from miso. I was glad I was able to taste actual shrimp in the wonton.   My rolls were the spicy tuna and the eel roll. I was pleasantly surprised so see the spicy tuna had asparagus in it. Something different to set it apart from other places, and it was very good. The eel roll was great with some eel sauce on top that wasn't too overpowering. I was full after my meal and felt satisfied without breaking the bank.  A note for vegetarians and vegans, my supervisor asked if they had vegan options and our waitress quickly brought over a menu. Not just \"oh we can give you a salad or some rice\" they had a decent sized vegan menu, and obviously more vegetarian options.   The inside is beautiful, and I had a great time. I can't wait to go back later and try some of those specialty rolls!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance here at night, very specific deliberate modern design and once seated inside you feel nestled in.   Very comfortable seating, a little low, but we got a great table at 8pm on a Friday night with no reservations for two. You may want to make reservations for a larger party as it was packed.   Menu options you'll find everything from sushi to green and red curry, sort of thai-japanese and other asian blend. Nothing too authentic but I order the green curry and found it had the right balance of sweet and spicy. It was chalk full of veggies too onion, lemongrass, mushroom, green and red bell pepper. So I would say it was about two large portions of food, or three small ones.  Very generous portions for the price, the drink menu was a little more pricey. I tried the pear sake and it was delicious! Even if you're not a sake lover you can order small amounts and test it out with a friend. I have tried apple, and peach flavored sake this was by the best.   Great service I cannot say we lacked for anything in that department. I always park in the private lot behind in the shopper center behind it and I have never had an issue. I think its there for this business--- I hope it is anyway."}
{"text":"Yummy Asian food! Thai ice tea need improvement. General Tso Shrimp taste good. Sushi was excellent! Recommended to all!"}
{"text":"Nice sushi, nice appetizers. Nice service and comfortable surroundings.  Close to shopping area and whole foods. Easy parking. And group-friendly!  Good choice for multi-cultural gatherings."}
{"text":"Went to Plum for happy hour on a Friday with two friends. Very good service. Our server was very accommodating (we ended up asking him to bring us all of their menus) and one of the sushi chefs kindly gave us a complimentary crab salad. What a sweet gesture! (It's normally $9.) It was fresh and delicious. We also got the roti canai (one of the better roti canais I've had!), salmon and avocado roll (pretty standard/good), and the spicy tuna roll (good and well-presented on the plate). I originally got the ginger cosmo but traded with my friend who got the Thai basil sake mojito because we both liked the other person's drink better. The mojito was sweet but also refreshing. Not bad for happy hour!  Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 4 Service | 4 OVERALL | 4"}
{"text":"Good place to grab Sushi in the Shadyside area."}
{"text":"I wanted to provide an update to my earlier review. I have visited Plum on several subsequent instances and the food & service has been top notch! This place has a great vibe and is a wonderful setting to reconnect with friends or visitors from out of town. Would certainly go back!"}
{"text":"Staying in Pittsburgh for business in the Shadyside neighborhood and decided to try this Asian restaurant for launch. They offer both indoor and outdoor seating which was nice for lunch. They also have a parking lot dedicated to the stores including this restaurant. The lunch meal came with an appetizer and I thoroughly enjoyed the hot and sour soup which had a nice kick to it. Also the green curry with eggplant and shrimp was fantastic! Very nice service as well!"}
{"text":"Really like the new menu! Lots of new goodies but still has the old favorites.   Also, I recommend going for lunch. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are perfect! If you're in the mood for sushi, they have good combo options."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here for Summer restaurant week 2015.  I had the miso soup, which I thought was excellent and was served in a larger portion than expected.  I followed up the soup with the Rock n'Roll sushi, the restaurant week special. I'm not a huge fan of shrimp tempura, but this roll was actually really tasty. It came smothered in a nice helping of the eel sauce and had some nice spice to it.  For the main course, General Tso's Chicken. The portion size was a bit smaller than expected, but the dish has some great flavor. Nice chunks of chicken and they weren't caked in breading like you'd normally find in take-out from the neighborhood place.  The drinks were nice and strong. The place was easy to get to and parking was readily available.  The only complaint was that our server was clearly normally a bar tender trying his hand out at waiting tables for the first time. It was a little slower of an experience than we had hoped for, but all in all he did a fine job and we enjoyed our time at Plum."}
{"text":"After my friend picked me up from the airport, we went here for lunch!  Parking for this establishment is in a parking garage. Easy to park and stay out of the rain/sun/cold.  Restaurant is modern and clean. We were promptly seated as there weren't a lot of people dining here. I wasn't in the mood for sushi, but they have a lot of items on the menu. I went for the roti canai and some vegetable dumplings. Yummy yummy! I wasn't the biggest fan of the canai sauce, but the roti and dumplings were super tasty. Service was a-ok, she wasn't overly friendly, but nice enough.  If I were to move to the area, I would consider the Shadyside neighborhood and this would be my go to sushi/Asian place for sure!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times. Service gets worse every try. We were one of 3 tables in the entire place and our server was MIA to take our order and to clear plates. Food was okay if I was on my couch eating leftovers. It tasted like takeout with a higher price tag. Decor is very nice regardless."}
{"text":"We went during mid-afternoon on a Sunday, so it was almost empty.  Our tea-leaf salad, pad Thai, and Thai basil stir-fry with tofu were all high quality and well-prepared.  Service was good, as expected, since we were almost alone. The cost was a bit high for local standards, but commensurate with the product."}
{"text":"Fresh fish!  I've been here twice, and the sushi is superb every time! So fresh, and so good!   I actually coerced myself into trying octopus sashimi, and I'm glad I did! To start I had a fantasy roll with salmon sashimi, and let me tell you... It might have been the best sushi I've ever had. I also paired the sushi with the 'Zen Garden' martini... or three :-)   After I finished that I opted for the octopus sashimi, and wasn't disappointed at all! That was my first time trying that, and it blew my mind.   The ambiance and service is great as well.   I will definitely be back here to satisfy my next sushi craving."}
{"text":"Plum is easily one of the nicest places to eat in this part of the city. The decor is simple but gives you the sense that you're in a place where manners matter. The service was a bit slow, but we had a large group so it's understandable. The food was portioned well and the selection was pretty good. It's the type of place where you have a sit down meal while dressed decently well; not an everyday type of plane, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Plum is an established Asian-Fusion spot in East Liberty. I've been there twice (for a company-sponsored dinner and another time with colleagues) and the good thing is that this restaurant most likely won't disappoint you. For me, it doesn't surprise me either.   The menu offers sushi, noodle dishes (chow fun, yaki udon, pad thai), fried rice, curry, classics like General Tso, vegetable wok dishes, pad thai, soups, dessert... you get the idea. Everything popular in the mainstream asian cuisine is thrown on the menu with normal Pittsburgh prices (noodle dishes $10-$12, wok $9-$13).  The food quality is good and everything I tried (sushi, lo mein, kung pao, coconut shrimp) was both well prepared and tasty. I personally prefer, however, authentic cuisine. But if you're on a date night and fight over what kind of Asian food to go for, Plum's \"one fits all\" menu might take away the stress. Recommended."}
{"text":"I'm very very torn about how many stars to give Plum. Very torn.  Here are the positive things: +great sushi +great interior +very solid appetizers and a knock-out hot and sour soup +good drink menu  But the negatives, oh... -service is almost non-existent. I've had to get up after 15 minutes of being ignored after being seated to ask if we have a waiter. No one even brought us water (!!) Then, the woman I asked, instead of apologizing, made me feel guilty by telling me that she wasn't my waiter, but she supposed she'd get us water and take our order (I suspect she was our waiter). This is not the only service horror story I have -price. Look, I get that this place is nice, but you can't charge this much for food and have service this bad. It's just insulting to have a waitress in sneakers when you're paying for a $30 plate of sushi.  Oh, and more staff issues. They have some guy busing tables in a baseball hat who has certainly been stoned every time I've been there. It's amazing.   Food: pretty great, if a little pricey.  Service, staff, etc: Horrifically bad.   Fire the staff, re-hire people who know how to dress appropriately for the atmosphere, politely attend to customers, etc. Also, if you're going to have non-wait staff bus tables, you need to have them dress as waitstaff and politely take items. The guy they have now is like a (stoned) bull in a china shop. No one wants to pay that amount of money for food and be ignored."}
{"text":"I have been to Plum for both dinner and lunch, and I definitely recommend dinner. They have a great selection of food that showcases talented chefs in the kitchen. My first trip I had this amazing duck dish in which the skin was perfectly crispy and the meat was so tender. I went with a friend who doesn't like duck, and even she was a fan after tasting it! On my second trip, I ordered the sushi. The sushi and roll were good. The shrimp as a little dry, but the salmon and tuna had a nice flavor and everything seemed fresh."}
{"text":"This place is so great! I feel bad that there's so much construction going on around Penn Circle because it's hard to locate right now. The ambiance is fantastic, very hip and trendy. The food is also fantastic! It's a mix between Japanese, Chinese and Thai. You really get the whole spectrum of Asian foods. We had sushi for an app, Thai for dinner and of course martini's for a drink. Even the martini's had an Asian influence, as they offered lychee Martini's with a fresh lychee at the bottom! Don't let the construction scare you off!"}
{"text":"We went here last night and I was eager to try the reincarnation of the old \"Richard Chen\" which closed a few months ago after it's highly anticipated and well documented opening a year ago.  This decor remains essentially the same as its previous reincarnation which is good, because I find the space perfect.  It's sparse and crisp with super high ceilings and minimalist decor.  The wood is dark and there is a new addition which is a relatively large sushi bar in the middle of the dining room.  I still think the bar is a little small and certainly not a bar meant for lounging or eating.  This is the second attempt at asian cuisine more suited to the Pittsburgh pocketbook.  We had a reservation for 730 PM and arrived a little early without a problem grabbing a seat.  There were a few empty tables when we arrived, but none when we left.  I wasn't too pleased initially when we arrived, because we were sat in my estimation at the worst table in the place.  It's a small two top against a wall near the sushi bar with heavy \"traffic\".  It took about 20 minutes for our server to arrive at the table and while I did appreciate her apologizing for the wait we found ourselves waiting for drinks, etc much of the rest of the evening.  I'll chalk it up to a new restaurant trying to find its rhythm.  We started with our drink standards...Annie with a vodka/tonic and me with a ketel dirty rocks.  The vodka/tonic was not good.  My dirty martini lacked olives and much flavor at all.  I also tried the tomio sake, which tasted pretty good, but was served in this tiny like bellini glass and was a very small serving for $7.  We started with a couple appetizers.  Annie ordered the chicken satay which is served with a peanut dipping sauce.  This was a pretty good dish, the chicken was moist the sauce strong, but not overpowering.  Paying homage to my west indian descent I ordered the roti canal.  Roti is a type of flatbread used with almost every meal in India and much of West Indies (Caribbean).  I consider myself a bit of a roti conneoisseur (sp?).  I'm pleased to say this was quite good.  It was warm, soft and buttery.  The curry sauce was pretty good, a bit thicker than I'm used too but good all the same.  And, both apps' were only $6 and $5 respectively.  Annie ordered the general tso's chicken and they were able to accomodate her request for only white meat.  It was fine, nothing memorable and certainly the healthiest version of general tso's I've ever tried in that it was breast meat and it wasn't fried.  I'm always eager to try a new sushi place, so I wanted to sample a good amount of the options.  I was happy to hear that everything on the menu was in stock...too often I find restaurants with expansive sushi menus only to find out they are missing the most interesting items.  I started with the sunomono which is a seaweed salad with cucumber and shrimp.  The seaweed was flavorful, but the shrimp was lacking flavor and not much of a portion.  I next tried the spicy tuna on crispy rice.  The ricecakes were what you'd expect I guess...bland, flavorless.  The only reason I ordered this was so I could add the quail egg ($1) to the mixture to increase the richness of this already rich mix.  The tuna itself was good and the two raw quail eggs were a fun addition and the quail egg was presented well on a foundation of wasabi.  I would of liked to order a very large selection of sashimi, however you could only order the sashimi in 6 pc .portions so that would have been a rather expensive ($10-$12) choice if a sampled a wide variety.  Not that the $10 is expensive for 6 pieces, I just would have prefered to pay $5 for 2 pieces and tried a wider variety.  I settled on the salmon sushi and the \"fatty\" salmon sushi.  These were both quite good and prepared properly.  I really couldn't tell the difference between the fatty and normal salmon, most likely just a way to get the consumer to spend a buck more on the fatty option.   Overall the food was pretty good.  I'll probably stop back if I'm in the area to work my way through the rest of the sushi menu, however even if the food was 3 or 4 stars and the prices reasonable.  Our table wasn't good, the drinks were pretty bad and the service while friendly was slow.  Hence, the reason for the 2 star review.  I'll give it another shot soon and hopefully update wth another star or two."}
{"text":"I had a delicious meal at Plum. They serve pan Asian food. There are sushi options, which I love! They sell traditional Chinese dishes as well. We got a deconstructed tuna roll for our appetizer. It was absolutely fantastic! We got Chinese dishes for our entrees. I got a shrimp dish for my entrée which was good and my boyfriend got a chicken dish which he said was okay. I would definitely recommend the sushi items. The prices are medium-high.The ambience of the restaurant is elegant and simplistic. The volume is good for talking. Overall, I enjoyed my experience there and would go back."}
{"text":"Going to Plum is mainly about going for the ambiance.  First thing I noticed as I walked in on a Friday evening; I was about 20 years younger than the average age.  Most of Plum's patrons appeared to be of the Baby Boomer generation, with some older and some younger.  Anyways, on with the food.  We split a South Beach roll as a starter and for entrees she had a chicken and asparagus and mushroom stir fry while I had their pan-seared duck breast.  The South Beach roll was interesting; it was hollowed out cucumber slices with tuna, white fish, avacado and tobiko.  I'm use to the more traditional methods of having sushi (sashimi / nigiri), so the crunch of the cucumber replacing rice was definitely different.  The chicken and asparagus stir fry is what you would expect the dish to be; thinly sliced chicken stir fried with chopped asparagus in a basic sauce (soy + corn starch).  Although it is a pretty basic dish, I do have to give them lots of credit for cooking the chicken to optimum doneness; it was tender and juicy as opposed to your typically overcooked chicken.  The seared duck breast didn't meet my expectations.  I expected well, a whole duck breast that had its fat rendered out and was seared.  I guess for me, hearing seared implies not cooked well-done all the way through.  Anyways, what was served up were five fatty duck breast pieces smothered in sauce.  Duck is a fatty animal, and thus when it's cooked, the fat is typically rendered out so it doesn't overpower the protein/rest of the dish.  Unfortunately, even though the duck was juicy, all I could think about the entire time was the excess amount of fat.  I would have also liked a tad bit less sauce overall.  With a drink each, our total came out to be around $80.  Don't get me wrong, I don't think Plum is a miserable place to be, just for me personally there are other restaurants that serve up food more in line with my taste at the same or even a lower price point.  For me personally, I might head to Plum if I'm trying to impress someone who cares more about ambiance over food.  I know Plum has a lunch menu as well; I'll update my review after I try them out during the day."}
{"text":"I like Plum but in all fairness I would have to say that my rating would actually be 3.5 stars, and not 4 stars, but because that's not an option and because there is never anything egregious about the food, I'm feeling generous and giving them 4 stars.  The food is good, but not great considering the other Thai food restaurants in the Pittsburgh area, but I've not ever had a bad meal here.  Today a group of us from work ordered takeout for lunch - the food was ready in 15 minutes, which was great and three of us got the pad thai with shrimp and the shrimp egg rolls.  I ordered my pad thai at a level 7 and it was disappointingly bland and actually didn't really even taste like pad thai (and was sans peanuts yet my coworkers has peanuts on theirs)...anyhow, needless to say I was really disappointed because I LOVE pad thai - I could probably eat it 5 days a week or more, but my wallet and my waistline couldn't handle that, so it was a bit disappointing to have pad thai that was just \"ok\", however the shrimp egg roll was delicious and almost made up for the bland pad thai.  The exterior was light and crispy and was delicious!  I've had better pad thai from Plum in the past, so I'm hoping that this was just an off day for them, however, now, I'm craving GOOD pad thai, so I may cave sometime next week and get take out from Nicky's on the Northside which is always a solid choice."}
{"text":"This is a solid pan-Asian restaurant on the border of Shadyside and East Liberty.  Their menu has a sampling of the more popular Chinese, Japanese and Thai dishes, but doesn't contain a lot of exotic Asian dishes or items from more exotic places like Malaysia, Vietnam or Laos.  The sushi is solid, and the bar is small but the bartenders are skilled.  It's a particularly solid place to go if you're with a group that has a varied palate range."}
{"text":"After a long walk on a hot day, my husband decided to take me to Plum. He'd heard some generally good things about it. The place was indeed pretty nice (ambience +) and the service was actually pretty good. Because we didn't have reservations, we ended up opting for bar seating, since they were full on reservations. Plum had a lot going for it, but I thought the food could be better. The hubby pretty much said the same thing that W Z. had... \"there was nothing Beijing about the Beijing pork loin\". It also tasted like the meat should have been marinated in the sauce, if they were still going to use what they had.. We also had the red curry. For both, it seemed like some of the ingredients were skimped.. there is such a thing as subtle flavoring, but just about everything was barely there... except for the spice, which they handled well enough. I think I would like them better if the food had more flavor, more personality. It wasn't bad, but I know I can move on to something else."}
