{"text":"When it was Rivas, it was always prime! It was still prime in the beginning after the change, but the last few times have been bad. The guy working the grill might need to take be more aware of what he's cooking. On more than one occasion the food was under cooked. I've gone back to have them cook again once."}
{"text":"Usually pretty good, but they get lazy sometimes. Bought dinner for my family just to get home and realize our quesadillas and bean and cheese burritos were all under cooked and none of the cheese had been melted and was still cold....I mean it's the 2 easiest things on the menu to cook....get it together dudes. And stop getting all pissed when I ask for extra salsa."}
{"text":"Food got me really sick. I got the chicken chimichanga, and was throwing it up after a couple hours of digesting."}
{"text":"This USED TO BE my favorite place ever.. seriously! they used to have the best salsa, best customer service EVER. Now, there's really mean women running the place who actually  think it's ok to cop an attitude with you when describing your order.. I miss the cute Mexicans who's used to run this joint when it was RIVAS and actually cared about getting your order straight. To tell a long time customer that pastor is the same as carnitas is just rude."}
{"text":"The last three times I've been here they've messed up my order. Their food is very bland and overpriced for what it is. Do yourself a favor and check out Los Favoritos or Mucha Lucha down the street."}
{"text":"Great place! The food was good, restaurant was clean, service was fast, portions generous, hours of operation excellent. 

At 4am, definitely the best indoor Mexican! I didn't notice any of the issues the other reviews had, I WAS initially nervous.

The 12 rolled tacos is an awesome deal."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service who will yell and deny customers Napkins or extra salsa! 
Ok so Since this place is open 24hours and is right next to my house I usually come in 3-4 times a week. After tonight I am never going to return. I ordered a California burrito To-go and as I was picking up my food, I asked the cashier/manager for Extra napkins. He responds, \"Their are plenty in your bag.\" I check the bag and again politely ask him for some extra napkins. He then flat out says \"NO\" while giving me a dirty look. I was confused as I have never been told no to extra napkins before. I thought maybe this guy is joking. So once again I politely ask, \"Can I please have more napkins?\" The cashier angrily replies \"I SAID NO!\" yet again. I was shocked how an employee would deny a paying customer napkins! I mean I noticed how extremely cheap this place is because of their actions. They limit each customer to 3 salsas each. As well as give more lettuce than chicken on their tacos. Honestly I don't think anyone could be satisfied with a taco with double the amount of lettuce as chicken/beef. 
If any Owner/Manager ends up reading this, you will make more money by keeping your customers happy. Denying paying customers something as simple as Napkins or extra salsa, is only going to make you LOSE money. I mean read some of the other reviews on here. And treat the customer with a little bit of respect, they are the ones keeping you in business. As for me, I will not be coming back. Thanks

I just remembered a previous interaction I had with this same cashier. I was eating inside the restaurant and was scooping salsa into a plastic container and accidentally spilled a few drops onto the salsa bar. Before I even had a chance to do anything, the same cashier started screaming at me and orders me to clean it up. I was already going to wipe up the 2-3 drops I spilled. Since I work in a restaurant, I always make sure not to leave any kind of mess behind. But I was definitely surprised at how an employee angrily yelled at a customer. At that time, I didn't think much of it and let it go. But after being disrespected by this same employee on multiple occasions, as well as seeing him disrespect other customers, I can see how this is the norm at this restaurant. I am honestly surprised at how he can still be working there."}
{"text":"The restaurant was recommended to our family by an acquaintance & we like to try new places. Recommendations are definitely hit & miss, this one was definitely a miss. 
When we arrived the inside smelled strange (a bit like a sewer) but we shrugged it off. There were not other patrons inside but we did see a few cars in the drive thru. 
My daughter is a bean burrito connoisseur & said she could still taste the can the beans came out of so that wasn't good. 
The self-serve soda machine had a Strawberry Fanta sticker but when we used it the soda was Orange. 
Last but not least, a family with small children arrived as we were finishing up. Strangely, they bought only a soda then sat down to eat their Burger King..."}
{"text":"Just tried to stop by here for food. 39 weeks preggo and the late night Mexican food craving just hit. I used to come to this place all the time in my early 20s when it was Rivas. I always liked it then, so figured I'd try them out tonight. Not only are they NOT Rivas, the guy was a jerk. I got to the window after ordering my food and noticed that they were microwaving my enchiladas in the Styrofoam container... I asked the guy when he came to the window, \"Hi, I'm sorry, but did you just microwave my enchiladas in a Styrofoam container?\" Reminder, I'm 39 weeks pregnant. The guy then proceeds to get upset and says, \"Yeah, everyone does that. Filibertos, everyone.\" I then said to him, \"You shouldn't microwave food in Styrofoam, it's toxic.\" He then says, \"Well, how else do you expect the cheese to get melted?\" Look, my problem isn't so much with the fact that they're using the microwave to melt the cheese of the enchiladas, but with the fact that they're heating it up in Styrofoam with no regard for the fact that it is toxic. I told him to forget the order all together and left. Definitely won't be going back there ever."}
{"text":"Ordered a carnitas burrito. Quality is what you would expect from any local 'bertos place. Terrible but acceptable when you are drunk. Cashier was very rude while I ordered. Went out for a cigarette and pulled a water bottle out of my pocket. Cashier came outside and accused me of stealing the water bottle. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I had a lovely chimichanga. I also had the pleasure of watching a soccer game while enjoying my meal, and the customer service is very friendly. The cashier/manager is good people; I believe his name is Alonso or Alfred or something along those lines. Any who, I highly rank this as one of the best eateries in town, but would I recommend it? Bet your bottom dollar I would!"}
{"text":"I was stopping in here about once a week for quite awhile on the way home from getting groceries since it was on my way.  The food was never better than average, but I could take each bite with a good portion of one of their salsas and that flavor is what brought me back.  They have a salsa bar and I would normally make five or six small salsas to enjoy with the food----two picos, two reds, two greens.  One night they started to police this, because I must be trying to get away with something, right?  It couldn't just be that I wanted to taste more of their salsas.  So tonight when I walked in I asked the guy immediately:  \"Is it okay if I have one salsa per taco (5) and another for my side of beans?\"  He shook his head quickly and said I could have 3 salsas.  As I started walking out the door, he could have said, \"Or you can pay $1 for every 2 extra salsa\".  I would have accepted, he would have made another $1.50 for 3 salsas, and I would still be going to Torres, rather than writing Yelp reviews.  But honestly, I never got the feeling they really cared for my business anyway."}
{"text":"Worst customer service . They got my order entirely wrong and refused to fix their mistake . Accusing me as a. Client that I said my order wrong. But I did not . Would never recommend this place to anyone ."}
{"text":"I've been there twice and my burrito was pretty good. Get the Special Burrito. It's a big and can't beat it for the price. The salsas were good too!"}
{"text":"This is my review of Torres that I made on 9/20/15 when it was still listed as Rivas Mexican Food on Yelp.  The experience was so bad that I needed to make sure people are still seeing it.
**********
Ugh.  

This isn't Rivas Mexican Food--it's Torres Mexican Food now, and we seriously wish we never went.

My burro was mediocre at best--absolutely no depth of flavor.  It was like a large version of one of those frozen, microwaveable burritos from 7-11.  My wife's and daughter's chile relleno plates were actually awful--they left the seeds inside the chiles, making them much too hot.  My daughter is Mexican in heritage and grew up on good homemade Mexican food from her Nana.  For her to complain that the food made her mouth feel like it was on fire really says something.  Even the jamaica was no good--really too sweet.

The final straw came with my bathroom visit.  It smelled like there was a natural gas leak in the men's room.  There was no soap, no paper towels, and the toilet paper roll had bloody fingerprints on it.

Yup, you read that right.  Grossed my ass out.  We are all seriously hoping we don't get sick now.  Never again."}
{"text":"Ordered sausage burrito and got home found out it was a ham burrito. Called them and they said sorry no refunds and they would not make us a new burrito. Drove back and the lady who took our order and the cook argued with us for 7 mins. I placed my uneaten ham burrito on the counter and asked if they can just make me what I ordered. The cook said \"fine\" and started slamming things around. I have never experienced this level of customer disrespect. I have been coming here for over 3 years. The food has always been good. This place used to be called Rivas, but after new ownership, service has tanked. Will not return after tonight."}
