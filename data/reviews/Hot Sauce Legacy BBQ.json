{"text":"I have been to some of the best fried chicken and bbq places in Memphis, and hands down this beats them all.  Hot Sauce Legacy BBQ sauce is sheer perfection - a balance of sweet with a layered undertone of heat (but no too much) and the chicken was a delightful light crisp and juicy on the inside.  Don't wait to check out this gem."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you're white and have a wife and kid. Soon as we got out of the car, a guy stood up from sitting on the curb to the parking spots and said \"Yes, white people!!\" Then told me his cousin owns the place and at the end of his overly excited conversation asked, \" Hey man, you think you could help me out with a couple of dollars so I can get something to eat?\"   I gave him two dollars right away because he was creeping my family out, and watched as he walked across the street to go get a \"Natty Daddy\" 25 ounce beer.  After getting in after 5 minutes of trying to get the crackhead away from us and entering the building, creepy stares and uncomfortable feelings of our business not being wanted ensued quickly with the patrons/workers.    Waited 20 minutes for our order of;  3 chicken breasts  a \"Po Boy\" side of fries side of mac-n-cheese side of coleslaw  Soon as we got our order, yet another gentleman approached us in the car, I rolled my window down already knowing what he wanted.  \"How's the fine couple doing this evening? Do you think you can spare some change so I can get me something to eat?\"  Told him I already gave my change to the first guy that asked.  He said \"FUCK MAN!\" Right in front of my son.  I put the car in reverse and noticed he tried to open my door. Fun times.  After all of that, hoping the food would resemble Hot Sauce Williams, I was completely unhappy. Coleslaw was at or above room temperature, almost tasted spoiled. My wife didn't even take a second bite of her \"po boy\" Mac-n-Cheese was bland and dry as can be. Chicken breast was waaaaayyy overdone.  Conclusion:                    Don't waist your time and go to Hot Sauce WIlliams instead.  This place is a joke. Sauce was a mediocre 2/10"}
