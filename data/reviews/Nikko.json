{"text":"This place is located in the Ballatyne area. The parking is kind of a pain sometimes, but it looks decent inside. 

Service can be kind of slow somtimes. Sushi is mediocre. My favorite sushi roll from there is the crunchy roll because its a little different from your normal crunch roll. This one they actually use crab meat for the topping on the rolls. 

Their hibachi dishes are a little bit pricey, and the taste is decent. You don't get your money's worth. But then again you're talking about the Ballantyne area where people are willing to pay more for less."}
{"text":"Food is GREAT. I'd go more often if it wasn't so far from where I am. Giving it 4 stars only because I've been there once."}
{"text":"Went for lunch around 1pm, after the lunch rush.  Place was empty, 2 tables occupied and I ate at the bar.  Prices were higher than average so i expected to be impressed. Ordered spicy tuna rolls, cpl pieces of maguro and spider rolls. Nothing too complex. When it arrived i was very disappointed. Tuna rolls were ok but the spider rolls were VERY soggy and fell apart.  Lunch for one totaled $30. Im fine with paying more if the quality is exceptional but this was very far from average. Never again!"}
