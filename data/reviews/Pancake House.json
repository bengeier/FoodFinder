{"text":"A little hole in the wall but I love it! If you can get past how the place looks, the lack of upkeep, the dishes not being the cleanest, the not so fresh smell, and focus on the down home friendly service, low prices, always hot fresh flavorful food & the often unintentionally hilarious or odd show watching the locals, then this is your place. I've never ventured off the breakfast menu, especially since they close at like 2p everyday or something. But when I go in for a late breakfast, many are eating lunch (looks like dinner meals) plates. Now I think I'll go by there this or tomorrow morning!"}
{"text":"Don't go out of your way to eat breakfast there.  My review is only based upon 1 visit: May 11 for breakfast special of 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, sausage patty, iced tea.  PRO: Convenient location in Gastonia, NC. Fast service. Friendly staff. Good price. Plenty of parking.  CON: Eggs needed salt and pepper. Sausage very salty and 1 small patty. Pancakes just pancakes, hard to get wrong. Tea standard sweetened.  Bottom line: I won't return, nothing special."}
{"text":"I would put this on par with the Waffle House. Don't expect anything fancy. When we were there the air wasn't working and it was so hot and stuffy. The bathroom was disgusting as well. (No changing table FYI if you have small kids.)   The servers were really nice and attentive but the food was disappointing. Eggs were cold, toast and bacon were limp. I will not be back. Only plus is that it was cheap!"}
{"text":"Servers: 4 stars Food: 3 stars Appearance: -5 stars Cleanliness: 2 stars  The owners of this place should be ashamed to serve food out of there  Close the doors and do a complete rehab"}
{"text":"The inside of the restaurant is nothing fancy but the food is good, cheap and the staff couldn't be more pleasant or friendly.    They bring a entire insulated coffee pitcher to your table and keep it full.  I never had to ask for extra napkins like most places because they leave ample large dinner napkins.  Extra butter for the grits or pancakes?  No need - they brought a slap of it in a saucer and I didn't even ask.    We didn't leave hungry and neither should you.  What's left to say - great service, cheap and good!"}
{"text":"Per the earlier reviews, this place is a great value with good food, very friendly staff and reasonable prices. Also, it is very easy to find (right in front of the Days Inn) and easily accessible from the freeway."}
{"text":"I have are here several times. I am a graduate of Highland School of Technology which is just at the top of the hill. Students would always indulge for a Pancake House breakfast before school started. My senior year my friends and I met at the Pancake House one last time before we graduated because it was a place where all came together for early morning breakfast before school. The pancakes and hot syrup are excellent!"}
{"text":"It's hard to make a bad omelet, but they did. Despite some reviews, the biscuits were mediocre at best. More remarkable was the dirty bathroom, complete with roach and roach motel. Had I entered the bathroom upon arrival, I would never have eaten here. I try to give a nod to mom & pop places, but this one needs some major attention to its facilities and food."}
{"text":"Decent place.  Kind of like a waffle house feel.  The old people love it.  Cost for breakfast is on the low end.  The Food is ok.  Service is average. Let's cover the basics: they make eggs, bacon, pancakes, hot coffee.  No different than anywhere else   It serves its purpose.  On the go breakfast next to the interestate to send you on your way.      Grade: C"}
{"text":"First time!  I'm not from here but come to Gastonia a lot. I've never noticed the restaurant before but found it on Yelp.  Mom and Pop style, family dining, good service and food was great.  Food was delivered fast.  $7.14 plus tax.  Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"The staff is excellent and in the past the food has been awesome but the last two visits our food has been cold!!  Maybe management needs to check their equipment.  Our past experience will have me giving them another chance."}
{"text":"Reviews are spot on - nothing special from the outside. Service is very friendly, prices are very reasonable and the food is really good.  If I am ever in this neck of the woods again, I would return."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for fast cooked breakfast  a lot to choose from o my get their early or wait about 15 minutes  worth"}
{"text":"In all fairness their air conditioning was out the morning we visited; however, it was obvious the locals love this place.  The food was pretty good for a diner.  The service was good.  I felt sorry for their kitchen staff as they were so hot.  The one dining area that had air was utilizing fans to try to keep service going.  I think they closed early that day."}
{"text":"We pull up and after checking yelp, Im thinking whhhhaaaa?? 4 stars, really? This place looks sort of sketchy on the outside, but step inside and it looks like an old county breakfast house. Nice, friendly, efficient staff. She hands us our menus and says \"Sit anywhere you like.\" The coffee was decent and the food took no time at all to come out. Man, what a fast turnout! Pretty decent food for a small price. We would so come back."}
{"text":"Good food and service for a fair price. 2 large breakfast platters and coffee for less than  $14.  They leave coffee thermos on the table so you never run out."}
{"text":"Visit was bad. No silver ware had to use plastic.  Very hot no air-condition 82 degrees in restaurant.  Ordered pancakes with whip cream.   Whip cream looked like milk.  Very bad"}
{"text":"The outside may be uninspiring but the inside is  surprisingly nice. Cup with saucer, pot if coffee on the table - hard to find these things anymore. I always stop for the spicy sausage"}
{"text":"Love mom and pop restaurants! This place was a knock out the park!! Western omelet was amazing and followed it up with the pecan pancakes!! Got my $'s worth that's for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I must admit, when we were looking for the Pancake House, we thought we were looking for The Original Pancake House. We arrived at the Pancake House instead. It is next to a Days Inn motel. It looks old, but it has character LOL! Prices are very reasonable. The most expensive breakfast combo is $8.45.  Coffee was good, though the use Coffee Mate. We asked for a small glass of milk for our coffee. Though it was crowded, our food came out quickly!  Standard breakfast fare, done well, for cheap."}
{"text":"Food alright needs up grades on everything else.... wished they had good customer service or more of a wait staff so you wouldn't feel over looked"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing here. The liver mush was just perfect. Their coffee is great always. I had the liver mush and cheese omelet. Scrumptious!!!!! It's a great family atmosphere. The prices are great bc I spent less than $8 for the omelet, toast grits and coffee. Everyone at my table was really satisfied. The wait staff was very attentive. The cooks were fast and made you feel like you were at your house eating with family."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for some time so I finally tried it and I will be back for sure. For one, it's not far, easy parking, spacious and well kept up restaurant space. The prices are awesome, very affordable. The food was good, the pancakes old fashioned and the Deluxe Western Omelette was flavorful and very tasty, I only wish it was more put together with the cheese to make everything inside the omelette more mixed up and gooey (like IHOP). We both ate for about $15 and it was nice sized portions. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not a bad breakfast at all. He had a veggie omelette which was big and full of veggies, with homefries and toast. I had scrambled eggs, bacon, homefries and biscuit.   The coffee was OK, not weak but definitely not full bodied, just OK. He said his omelette was better than he expected. My eggs and bacon were just fine. Homefries were better than either of us thought they would be. Biscuits were just meh.   Prices were excellent and service was very friendly. Would definitely go again. Breakfast for us both was only a little over $13.00."}
{"text":"Very very good! Cheap too. Our servers have always been super nice and polite. My only concern is the bathrooms are horrid and smell like an old dirty church basement. The place has been here forever and could use a few upgrades."}
{"text":"What can I say? The food here was great! The service was friendly and the place had a welcoming feel. The bathrooms were clean but gross looking and the decor was horrifying with the stained ceiling tiles and outdated pieces. However, the old school look was kind of cool. We had pecan waffles, chocolate chip pancakes, pecan pancakes, bacon and liver mush biscuit. Everyone agreed that food was delish! And cheap! I'd totally go back next time I'm in Gastonia."}
