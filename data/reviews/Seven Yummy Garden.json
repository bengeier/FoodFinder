{"text":"Cheap and has a lot of variety. I really like the place since it's not as loud as other Chinese restaurants and has nice chairs.

The people are also really nice and although there isn't any picture on the menu, they're willing to explain what each food is."}
{"text":"Really good food at fair prices."}
{"text":"My first visit to this restaurant and it has ample seating for patrons.  I ordered the Cantonese chow mein (beef) and it was great.  Pricing on the lunch specials is such a great value @ $7.50 and it includes the entree, a soup and a spring roll.  Portion size is just right.  I was at a table of 4 people and they brought out the food for the other 3 people but took 10, the minutes for my dish to arrive.  I will probably come back again."}
{"text":"Pros:
Great portions
Good prices

Cons:
Noodles over cooked for soup noodles

Seven Yummy Garden is a little gem hidden away in a tiny plaza that you would normally never know about.  The only reason I found it is because I recently moved into the area and managed to catch a glimpse of it while driving by.

This place has a very warm decor to it.  It's not what you would usually expect for a Chinese restaurant.  They have a very extensive menu here.  It's a double sided large piece of paper.  They seem to specialize in Northern Chinese cuisine.  The menu has simplified Chinese and there are a lot of spicy dishes here.  

We ordered a beef noodle soup and a fried noodle.  A plate of A vegetable was also ordered.  One thing I have to say about this place is that the portions are very good.  My bowl of noodles was huge!!  The amount of noodles I got was very filling.  You get pretty good value for what you pay. The fried noodle was very good.  I liked that dish the best.  

My only beef is they over cooked the noodles in the beef noodle soup.  I'm someone who likes my noodles as al dente as possible so that bothered me a bit.  It's still a very good bowl of noodles though.  Just me being picky about my noodles.

I'm definitely coming back to Seven Yummy in the future.  Because of the close proximity to my new house, this could easily be one of my go to restaurants in the future."}
{"text":"Very friendly almost home style cooking Chinese restaurant. They offer some real nice north eastern Chinese dish. Such as fermented cabbage with glass noodles and pork - 'Suan Cai Chao fen' and sweet and sour pork - 'Guo bao rou' etc. I think their dishes are very reasonably priced. A little heavy on the oil side but I guess it's very normal with these dishes, definitely not light at all. I felt like I need to keep drinking tea to wash the oil off from my stomach. But I would still come here to eat if I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I went in for my usual, and this time I got takeout. Omg, the chicken tasted spoiled as if it was sitting on the sun and outside overnight and then prepared. I really didn't want to call and complain but crappy food is crappy food and the people have the right to know. My rating is now 1 star and not sure I will give this place another chance. No thanks! You don't serve spoiled chicken to a customer no matter what, no excuses, don't want to hear it! Bye bye forever!"}
