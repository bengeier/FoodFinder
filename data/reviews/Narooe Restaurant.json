{"text":"This was my first time here with a friend. My friend ordered the octopus bibimbap and I ordered the boiled barley and the seafood noodles. The bibimbap was pretty good, but I found the octopus a bit too chewy, which would take a while to eat. I liked the boiled barley the most out of the 3 entrees that we had. The seafood noodles were good, except for the mussels because they had a lot of sand... I actually had to spit one out because it was loaded with sand.

The portions are quite big for what you pay for, I wouldn't mind trying this place out again, but I wouldn't purposely make my way there."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place out since it opened but didn't get the chance to do so until today but I am glad I did. Me and my friend ordered seafood fried rice each and Kkanpungi (Chinese inspired sweet and sour chicken) and I have to say its probably one of the best I've eaten in any Korean restaurants in awhile. Other places use way too much sauce or it is downright soggy but Kkanpungi here was at least to my taste bud, just right. Also waiting staff was friendly and attentive. I will be visiting this place soon to try their extensive menu."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch one time with my mom and enjoyed the food. Second time I brought my friend to have early dinner. Restaurant was pretty empty and we were the only table. 

Ordered cold noodles and some other pork bbq dish. BBQ pork dish was disappointing, not much meat and the pieces that I could find was paper thin. Seriously? pork is not even that expensive! Noodles were over cooked and they served us stale eggs on top. My friend tried eating it and had to spit it out because it was so disgusting. Right after that happened, we told them about the eggs and the server kept on saying it's fine and she went on to smell the egg my friend spit out which I found to be DISGUSTING. We asked for our bill immediately because we didn't feel like eating anymore (with half of the food still left on the table) and they just brought us the full bill. NO APOLOGY or anything. We just paid and left no tip. I won't be going back to this restaurant, I have a feeling they are going to go out of business soon anyways."}
{"text":"Relatively new restaurant in a location that seems to be ever-changing! 

Placed an order for take out: veggie/tofu bibimbap, and the tofu stew. The bibimbap was loaded with great veg, and the hot sauce (on the side) was gorgeous - had a good bite to it, but was not so overpowering that everything else lost its flavour.

The tofu stew was great - wonderful flavour and loaded with huge chunks of tofu. The only curious / off-putting thing here was that the 3-4 shrimp in the stew all had the shell still on the tail -- !!! Why?! It was quite unexpected to be chewing on the shrimp and then all of a sudden be crunching on a shell :/  Aside from that one inexplicable thing (which I hope they rectify), it's an excellent soup.

I hope more people give this place a chance -- it never appears to be too busy, compared to the many other Korean restos in the area. Give 'em a shot! Good food, pleasant service (they even provided tea as I waited for my take-out), and fairly priced. Go!"}
{"text":"Narooe opened up close to where I live, and one day decided to give it a shot.

Best. Decision. Ever. 

The food is fantastic. Glorious, even.

The kimchi pancake is really good; the seafood pancake is even better. When I ordered the seafood pancake with some friends, I pretty much inhaled it all and was left saying, \"I'm sorry, did you want some?\"

The daepae samgyeopsal is amazing. It's actually pretty difficult to find this in Toronto (or maybe I haven't been looking in the right places). It's like regular pork belly, but the slices are thinner and it's dipped in some sauce before grilling at your table. Also, it's served with a wide assortment of leaves - red lettuce, nappa cabbage, sesame leaves, and etc. So, you can use a variety of leafy goodness to wrap up those mouth-watering pieces of grilled pork, then proceed to inhale it all in. 
Side note, the best kept secret in my opinion about KBBQ is grilled kimchi. You know that kimchi they serve to you as a side dish? Throw that bad boy on to the grill so it can fry in the samgyeopsal goodness, and then toss that inside your leafy wrap as well. Enjoy.

Now, my personal favourite on the menu: the kalbi tang (Beef short rib stew). The other soups are great, too, but this kalbi tang is the best I've had in Toronto. Normally, the soup tastes like water. But at Narooe, the broth is extremely tasty (and it's not msg!) and the beef is really tender. I highly recommend this dish.

Honestly, I've had almost everything on the menu there, and you really can't go wrong. 

Narooe has delicious food at reasonable prices and with friendly service. If you're a Korean food lover, then you should definitely check this place out. Your taste buds will thank you for it."}
{"text":"Narooe is a Korean restaurant on the north side of Yonge/Finch.
They have a lot of advertised specials which don't appear on the menu such as pork bone soup for 5.99.

The pork bone soup was one of the best I've had in Toronto, with very meaty bones and an excellent flavour broth.
We also tried a chicken teriyaki bibimbap for 9.99 in a stone pot, which comes with a miso soup.  The flavour profile was also very good, and had been cooked for the perfect amount of time.  

We were also served 4 banchan - kimchi, eggplant, bean sprouts, and seaweed.  We were given refills when asked also.

Overall, the care and presentation used for each dish was stunning.  The waitress was very pleasant and attentive.
Looking forward to coming back - I would definitely come back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"It's a good Korean restaurant. Tried their pork belly, duk bok ki and seafood pancake and all of them taste good."}
{"text":"Narooe just recently opened near where I work and I was eager to try it. They have a fairly good lunch selection with prices ranging from $7.95 - $11.95. The rest of the menu is quite eclectic and includes items such as spaghetti with meat sauce. Needless to say, I was a tad surprised at this one.

I was there for lunch and opted for the Teriyaki Chicken lunch special for $8.95. The dish included miso soup, salad, glass noodles, gyoza, gimbap and what looked to be, 1 1/2 chicken thighs served over sauteed onions and sweet peppers. Oh, and creamy pasta salad. (?)

The soup and salad were standard fare but I will say, the dressing on the salad was quite flavourful!

The chicken was good, a little tough and perhaps a tad over cooked but good. It was a nice change from the tenderized chicken breast that is normally served when ordering this type of meal. The gimbap, glass noodles and gyoza were all pretty standard and quite flavourful.

I don't know if it's just me but I could not connect the dots to the creamy pasta salad that was served with this meal. The flavour profile was completely different and it seemed out of place. The taste was okay but I'll admit, it confused me.

We were also served a kimchi pancake which was delicious! Not as hot as I expected but I was actually pleased about that. I would definitely get this again.

Over all, a nice place to have lunch and I will have to start working my way through their menu."}
{"text":"I got the bulgogi bibimbap. It was alright. Its nothing special or nothing about the place stood out to me. It's not bad, but I also don't particularly think it's good.

I wouldn't go back there if I have a choice."}
{"text":"It's my second time dining here and found this place by accident the first time. It's still a pretty new restaurant and it wasn't very busy but I don't understand why because the service and quality of good here is a lot better than some of the restaurants nearby. 

Ordered Kimchi Bulgogi Bibimbap (10.95$), Chicken Terriyaki Bibimbap (9.95$) and the Kimbap (5.95$). We received four ban chan - bean sprouts, kimchi and two others I don't remember the name of. The food arrived shortly after we ordered and the food was freshly made. Both Bibimbaps were sizzling hot and had good flavours. 

Service was really friendly and attentive. I would definitely come back here again. It's great to eat in a Korean restaurant that is not overly cramped and crowded. Check this place out, I think you will enjoy it!"}
