{"text":"Found my new hang out!! This place is amazing on so many levels!  We decided to check out a new Sports bar for NFL game last night and WOW! The outside of this place does it NO justice!! It is the nicest sports bar I've been to in some time. Could not believe the number of TV's this place had....BIG bonus for us sports fans. The place was packed with fans cheering on the Cardinals, however it is clearly a Chicago themed establishment....BIG bonus for you Chicago fans. Had some really cool sports memorabilia and photos of Chicago throughout the entire place. Now on to the Service...We sat at the bar since it's the best seat in the house. We were greeted by a bartender who introduced herself (Kristen). She has the best smile and a personality to keep you entertained for hours!! She truly was the epitome of incredible customer service!! As I mentioned the place was very busy but both her and the other Bartender Jonny handled the bar with ease. They were both very attentive and VERY friendly. I go out a lot and will say the two of them are one of the main reasons we will be back on a regular basis.  We waited for nothing, and Kristen made several suggestions as to what we should eat. Service to me is one of the most important elements in my dining experience. I sat back and watched how the two of them took care of not only my friends and I but this huge bar full of people and never once did I see them without a smile or a great attitude! We decided to have a pie, and very glad we did. I don't think I have had a pizza that good ever!! I am stoked we decided to venture out of our comfort zone and found a new spot with great food AWESOME bartenders, and enough TV's to satisfy all of our sports requests! I HIGHLY recommend anyone come check the place out you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Drive to PHX for the real Rosatis taste at Thomas and 40th street.  This Franchised Rosatis sauce cheese and crust are different - 3 stars based on that.  The fact you can sit down and eat comfortably was nice."}
{"text":"I'd give this location 0 stars if I could. Lots of tvs, decent food, great bar area potential but the worst service I have ever seen in my 6 years of living in Arizona. Ordered an appetizer and 2 entrees and had to ask for water 3 times. Our bartenders acted like they were actively trying to not help us, not even showing a half effort level. Prices are way too expensive for the extremely average quality food. Definitely will not ever be attending this location if any others in the future."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Great in the summertime, pizza is always good...fresh and as ordered. Wintertime expect a wait for a table. Mosey up to the bar while you wait...beer is always good and cold."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service and awesome Staff!! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Great late night happy hour, and trivia during the week"}
{"text":"We waited over 30 mins for 12 pieces of wings and garlic bread and it wasn't very busy, apparently there was a miscommunication on their part...then they said they would give us a discount for their mistake but when we got our bill..there was no discount...we didn't bother saying anything because we just won't be coming back :) the wings were ok"}
{"text":"Huge fan!  Great food, and great sports bar atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Finally! A Rosati's location that delivers to my location. We just finished the best pizza I have had in a long time. Reminded me of a Villa Nova pizza from Villa Park, Illinois for anyone that is familiar. We had the thin crust Classic Combo. It was delivered in 45 minutes, was hot and delicious. Will be ordering this every pizza night!"}
{"text":"Thee new place to be and be seen..great food,better service,fabulous atmosphere.best sports bar in Arizona."}
{"text":"This is a huge upgrade from the last place... chances R? The layout makes much more sense. An excellent choice to meet for a ball game. TVs everywhere. Then a couple of mega screens for feature games. It is a place known for their Chicago style pizza.  We had sandwiches.  They were fine, but I'll go with the sure thing next trip... pizza. Save room for the ice cream cookie desert. 1 will feed 2 people."}
{"text":"Super disappointing :( . 85 minutes waiting in anticipation of their amazing pasta and I get a stupid sandwich delivered instead. $35 delivery order and I get my own refrigerator  leftovers from last night.  I will think twice next time I'm craving pasta."}
{"text":"Shut up bitches...they always have good food n good attitude. ...if it was not right from the beginning then they make it right! !! Best spot ever. ..i give this a 10!!!"}
{"text":"Great Screen coverage from every angle and every seat. Excellent place to watch any event. Food is good as well and the service was enjoyably pleseant."}
{"text":"While visiting from Chicago, I chose Rosati's to get pizza and cocktails with my daughter to watch the Cubs vs Dodgers NL playoff game. Sausage thin crust pizza was ordered extra crispy and it was awesome, very good.  $5 glasses of house Pinot Noir were really good and a great value!  What was even more outstanding was the service! We sat out on patio at long tables as inside was crowed with a big group and lots of folks watching the game. Haili took care of us all evening over the course of 4 hours.  Even though she was busy, she was all over it for us making sure we always had what we wanted: drinks, fresh water, condiments, anything!  She was a total sweetheart and made our night even more fun!"}
{"text":"The general manager, Robert, reached out to me after my initial post. He was very gracious, kind and understanding. So we gave it another go tonight and everything arrived on time, fresh, hot and DELICIOUS! My kiddos are so happy as am I. The person who took my order was pleasant and the person who delivered my order was very nice.  I knew that this place would be a good one and it shows.  Just because there were some growing pains, it's nothing that cannot be fixed and the GM is on top of making that happen. Thank you to Robert and all of the staff at the 6th Ave Scottsdale Rosati's location!!! You all nailed it!!! We will continue to order from here and will try the the dine-in experience in the near future as well. :)"}
{"text":"Today was our first time trying out the new Rosati's in Old Town Scottsdale. Have heard about the place and saw them on Groupon so figured why not...turned out to be a great decision. We are from Chicago and the place is filled with so many pictures and sports memorabilia from all the Chicago teams. After we looked around we sat at the bar and were greeted by the bartender Kristen who was amazing by the way!! The place was pretty busy but she was so cheerful and  on top of everything. She made great suggestions as far as food goes since it was our first time. We tried the wings and the white pizza both were delicious!! She also recomeneded a drink called the cucumber bliss it was perfect for a hot day... Not too sweet and very refreshing The bar was very clean and has so many TVs its a GREAT spot to watch sports!! We started talking to some other people at the bar who said they come in frequently on the weekends just to see Kristen and I think we will do the same. Not only was she great with all of the customers she made our day very enjoyable and definitely made a great first impression for this place!!  We too will tell all of our friends about this incredible new sports bar."}
{"text":"They wouldn't honor the phone coupon that we subscribed to, so we left. Seriously bizarre."}
{"text":"So my husband and I cannot get enough of this place!! we have come on several occasions now including tonight and have tried a new pizza every time! Simply delicious!! They also have a great Happy Hour beers very cheap and the bar is immaculate it's always so clean and fresh when you walk in there! The only reason I gave it 4 stars today is because the last three times we've been there same girl has waited on us.  On our first visit she was bartending and was so friendly and upbeat which is one of the reasons we decided to come back.  The other two times she was our waitress and she is always so lovely.  Her name is Kristen...she is always smiling and seems to really enjoy her job. She has made some great suggestions the past few times and we did not get the same sort of service there this evening. Although our server was not bad we did not get the same attention and did not feel as welcome as we have in the past. That aside, again the food was amazing and all in all we had a great dinner.  This will be a Fan Favorite during football season for sure.  If you have not been in this place yet it is worth the visit for sure!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I received coupons for the Dobson location in the mail, so we decided to check it out.  We used the $14.99 coupon to order two pastas, a side salad, and a garlic bread appetizer.  Our waitress slow and inattentive, and did not express any enthusiasm. When we ordered, she forgot our side salad and brought us the wrong appetizer. She was slow to take away dishes and provide refills. The \"garlic\" cheese bread was devoid of any garlic.  The restaurant wasn't very busy, but it still took half an hour to receive our pastas. Our waitress did not bother to apologize when I pointed out that she forgot the salad.  Both pasta dishes were lukewarm. Neither were very good at all, with my girlfriend stating that her sauce tasted straight from the can for her raviolis. There was no seasoning to either dish and the ratio of sauce to pasta made it taste like we were eating sauce straight from the jar.  I've been to other locations which I've been pleased with, but I don't think I'll be going back. There are better Italian restaurants and sports bars out there."}
{"text":"Terrible staff. The guy at the front was on the phone taking an order, the other girl was standing there on her phone ... no one acknowledged me for a good five minutes. I said I had a pick up and they told me it would be right now and I waited there for 40 minutes when it should've been 20 minutes. When another guy comes out which looked as if maybe he was the manager he asked me if this was for me and I said I'm not sure because my first thought was maybe it could belong to somebody else. and then so he yelled out if and asked if it was mine and  was completely rude about it. I do not think three pizzas would take an hour and no one even bothered to tell me if there is any delays. Terrible experience it seems as if none of the staff wants to be there. Go to another Rosati's."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome place to hang out and drink some beers! Plus they have amazing food. I would recommend this pub to everyone. It's family friendly and just a really relaxed place."}
{"text":"Best service I've had in a long time. The bartender Jamie was very happy and inviting. I would recommend going there to anybody. I like to go there a few times a week, just because of the staff and the food is so great."}
{"text":"I dined here tonight and after reading the negative reviews didn't know what to expect. They seem to have worked out whatever issues they had. Server was very attentive and service was excellent. Beer was cold and food came out promptly and was good. Laid back fun atmosphere. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I had a really good experience here. First of all, I like that the place isn't too packed every time me and my husband go in, probably because they have only been open less than a year. We usually go on Sundays to watch the game. The drinks were actually really reasonable. My margarita was only $5 and it was pretty big! The wings were awesome too. Absolutely delicious. It was kinda nice because I was going to order boneless and my waitress recommended that we get the Jumbo with bones being that they are the same price with much more meat. But it only took about 10-15 minutes to get the order. I usually invite my friends to come with us as well and will continue to recommend people.. If your looking for a busy party place, definitely not the place for you, but to come and relax with family and friends, eat some food and have a couple drinks, Definitely try it out."}
{"text":"Great pizza spot in Old Town. Took over and completely remodeled the ole Chances Are space. Large bar and plenty of table/boot space. Wait til Fall, it will be packed. Food coming out of the kitchen looks and is spot on. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Brought in 5 people, busy Sunday night. Bartender said it will be a bit.  Accommodated, so far so good!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, service and atmosphere!! Will be back with my friends to watch games, they have over 100 TVs and tons of sports memorabilia! Old town Scottsdale needed a place like this!"}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon and wanted an Italian Sub.  Was told it was not available.... \"Everything if frozen and nothing is preped\". At least the beer was cold."}
{"text":"I have been to Risotis a couple of times with not so good results and figured i would try one last time. I ordered the cheesy bread and a calzone with sausage, mushrooms, and black olives. After a little wait the calzone came, and as all the times before the inside was not hot . This  was very disappointing since each time i have cone in i have expressed my disappointment and each time the manager told me they need to figure out a way to make them hot in the middle. Even more frustrating was watching one of the servers eat a slice of pizza that had been made incorrectly and sat in the wimdows for aboit 3 minutes a d say ooooh this is HOT. I will once again say if the middle is not getting hot enough then the ingredients need to be heated prior to putting them in the calzone (they are pre cooked anyway). So that they continue to heat up in the oven. The other dissapointing thing was that the appetizer of cheesy bread was brought out right before i left. Now they did comp the bread so i give them credit for that. If you are wanting ro be considerwd one of the best chicago Pizza joints you need to show it everyday, every hour and every minute.  George"}
{"text":"We were hungry after returning from a weekend trip and decided to try Rosati's Pizza since it is nearby. We ordered a small 12\" thin crust pizza for delivery and were very disappointed with the quality of our pizza. The Zeppoli was OK.  Pro's + The delivery was fast.  Con's - The pizza was under-cooked. - The crust seemed soggy. - It was too salty. - The toppings were buried under a pile of cheese.  We would not recommend going to this location."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza, other food is very good too. Pricing is fair. Bartenders are lazy. Waitress are very hard working. Outstanding environment to watch sports, wall to wall 42 inch tv's (plus 4 gigantic big screens). Not super crowded because it is new, and also slightly off the beaten path... but worth checking out. Don't expect friendly treatment from bartenders, however."}
{"text":"Thought I would come back to one of my childhood pizza places. It's a nice new place but I was very dissatisfied with my waitress. Not very friendly and didn't even ask if I wanted dessert! I was thinking about it, but felt like I was pushed out the door. Sorry to bother you today young lady! I think I will give it another shot but I'm not sitting in her area again..."}
{"text":"Never ordering from this place again. We ordered our pizza around 8:50pm. We confirmed our address with the employee twice. The place is 2 miles away from us and we had been told that the pizza should be delivered in 45 minutes. After waiting an hour, we called to check on the status of the pizza. The employee said that the deliver should be there in 10 minutes. After waiting another 30 minutes, we called to speak to a manager. We informed her of the situation and informed her that we were worried the pizza would be cold. The mamager said that she would call the deliver to see where the the hell he is at. The deliver said that he would be there in a minute. The deliver called again to confirm the address which was wrong. The address that he had driven to which was in Phoenix and it was 15 minutes away from us. The deliver said that he would be there in five minutes before we knew that he was in Phoenix. We called the pizza place  again to check on the status of the pizza. The person who answered the phone was someone who made the pizza. We informed him of the situation. The cook said that we could check the pizza once it had been delivered and if it wasn't to our standards since we had voiced many times that the pizza would be cold by now, he would remake the pizza. We told the cook that we appericate he's efforts but that we were just going to cancel the pizza. In total we waited 2 hours. Around 11pm the deliver called to say he couldn't find our place. We had to inform him that we cancelled the pizza 15 minutes ago. The most improfessional people we have had to deal with."}
{"text":"I stopped in during Spring Training to check out their Happy Hour. I liked the layout and sports bar decor with TVs everywhere. The service was great but the place was pretty empty at the time.  They have a decent beer selection. We tried the dough nuggets (basically a large pizza crust cut up into bite sized pieces and fried) and were impressed with the quality and quality."}
{"text":"2nd time i ordered delivery.  Tell me 45 minutes when I order.  Call after an hour 10 minutes.  Tell me another 10 minutes.  Wait another 30 minutes.  Call.  Girl tells me its \"out\", whatever that means.  I say how long she replies \"i dont know, what do you want me to do\".  Tell her I was told 45 minutes, her response was \"gosh Ive been telling people hour and half\".  Worst service ever, cant believe these people."}
{"text":"We had amazing service at one of our favorite neighborhood bars!! Jasmine has been our server so many times!! brought us ice cold beers and kept them coming without having to ask. We luv coming here for many reasons but the main one is that we have friends to welcome us back!!!! We are always so impressed with a server that actually cares about doing a good job & making her regulars happy... & jasmine is always there for us!! Why don't more Scottsdale bars understand this simple but necessary concept, to keep people coming back?? Totally recommend Rosati's after a long work day & make sure you REQUEST Jasmine as your waitress. Your experience there will b even better!!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Love there pizza and antipasto salad. I've been there a few times and food is consistently very good and I walk out full and surprisingly their prices aren't bad either."}
{"text":"This was our fave pizza place. The monster pizza had so many great toppings. But tonight.... nope nope nope. Called in an order and was told 20 min. Showed up and was told 20 more. Walked back in after that 20 and they hadn't even put it in the oven. Asked for a manager and they said he was putting on sauce on pizza and couldn't come out. Asked for a refund and left. Left a long line of other angry people too.   This was avoidable -   1. Call people when their orders are running late 2. Apologize. Just once. You know, like you care about this issue. Give an explanation if you really want my sympathy or my future business.  3. STOP TAKING MORE PHONE ORDERS UNTIL YOU GET CAUGHT UP. Seriously.  4. Offer a future coupon or discount on this 60 min (!?) Order.   Disappointing. But hey, there's always the Gilert location to try!"}
{"text":"So we just ordered a pizza and wings and mozzarella sticks on a delivery and cash payment... Order came fine food (pizza and mozzarella sticks) were good but the wings didn't have any wing sauce on them! We called them back and it just got worse from there ....   The manager said they want the food BACK!!!! WHO DOES THAT?? anyways my stepdad went to go return the chicken wings.... The manager said that he had to go return them himself because the their \"driver\" isn't allowed to carry cash at all ... So he went back to return the wings to get his money back .... Only reason why I'm saying 2 stars is because my pizza and mozzarella sticks were good .... Otherwise i would have given a 1 star... Still can't believe the way they handled this ... F this place stay away!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered  takeout... 18 inch combo. Did online order.  Took exactly 30 minutes as promised.  Friendly girl at register.  Pizza looked great.. Hot and fresh.  This was late Sunday.  This was my first time trying there pizza.  Was looking forward to a great tasting pizza.   Pizza was just OK.  Nothing great.  Not bad.  Almost bland.  Nothing to crave or want to order again.  I can't figure out what is not good about the pizza.  It needs something not sure what.  It has ample toppings  and cheese.  I think it needs better sauce or more of the sauce.   The bar looked nice.    Can't see myself ordering a pizza from here again."}
{"text":"Just swung in for a quick drink, haven't tried the menu yet. A guy was playing great live music and the mariners game was on tv. I enjoyed myself despite the Mariners doing everything in their effort to ruin my day. Leaving 3 men stranded on base when you were able to load them with no outs, are you kidding me? The place has lots of tv's leaving you with a perfect view of Nelson Cruz striking out no matter where you turn your head. If there are any mlb pitchers reading this, throw a slider on Cruz low and away, he'll chase it every time."}
{"text":"Came for the sports and great food then trivia took over. I could no longer hear what was going on with my playoff game. Even the hearTV wasn't broadcasting the game for a fallback option. Just shocked a sports bar with two sports in playoffs and trivia took over the evening. Wish you the best of luck."}
{"text":"Thought I would give this place a shot. We were seated outside on the patio maybe a foot away from a TV that was turned off. Meal was great until some other waitress asked if we wanted the diamond backs game on. We said no, she informed us that she is going to put in on anyway. The rest of the meal consisted of being blasted with baseball commentary under the digital glow of the giant patio TV that was maybe a foot away. Not down to be bullied by a 50 something, Pam Anderson wanna be and her steroid infusion of a last ditch effort to find love before she dies boyfriend thing. Food was good, our actual waitress was lovely, drinks were good.... never coming back. Judging by their Friday crowd they won't be there to much longer anyways"}
{"text":"New to the area and found them while getting my car fixed.  The food was great and quick, good selection in beer on tap.  The service was amazing.  They have TVs for all the sports.  I'll definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal! Came out fast and hot. Cooked and garnished. Two servers name Jessica and Sonja got my orders out fast and were attentive to my demands. Restaurant is spacious and clean. Great price and sports to watch!"}
{"text":"During our two most recent visits there has been a skull-piercing high-pitched whine emanating from the kitchen. Pizza's good, though."}
{"text":"Have eaten there twice now since they opened for lunch. Had great wings and pizza during a sit down and lunch and today was able to get a slice on the go through the side entrance. Has two patios and one is dog friendly. Inside is awesome feels like I could really watch the tourney there all week."}
{"text":"This is the second time Rosati's has messed up a order. I order a pizza and breaded mushrooms and asked to pick it up in 45 minutes. The order wasn't ready, so the manager told them to put a rush on it. I get the food home, the pizza is burnt and I have 6 mushrooms."}
{"text":"Pizza and some sandwiches are good (order something you would buy in Chicago) and beer prices are good but that's about it. Service is horrible EVERY time unless we sit at the bar and get one of the bartenders. Nearly all C to F when it comes to wait staff. Beyond pizza, food is EXTREMELY bland (Taco Tuesday & Sunday brunch were an immediate \"never again\"). The bar setting is friggin awesome and that is what keeps us coming back. Not to mention the draft beer selection is as good as anywhere I have ever seen. Sculpin, Space Dust, Union Jack (IPA fans). If you like beer and TVs, this is the place."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. I ordered food tonight and after being told it would be an hour and a half wait for delivery my boyfriend and I decided to pick it up. Once we got home we discovered they gave us the wrong pizza and wings. Called to report the problem and was placed on a 10 minute hold only to have the manager laugh and tell me it was a new system error. Placed the order again, drove back to pick it up, waited another 45 minutes only to have the same manager tell us there was nothing she could do because of the new \"system\". Didn't offer any refunds or vouchers for our next visit. Coming from working in a customer service industry I can confidently say I will not be returning to this location for a long time. Manager should also go through some additional training and be taught not to laugh when a customer reports a problem they created."}
{"text":"Watched the National Championship Game with some guys from work and loved it. Had the deep dish and it was just like in Chicago. Not doughy and crisp crust even with the deep dish which was perfect. A lot of TVs so everyone in our party had a great angle for the game.  Really enjoyed it and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game.  They have enough tvs that you can see from any table.  They also have tvs on the patio if it's a nice day.   The food is excellent.  The dough bites almost taste like a savory doughnut...delicious.  The meat mania pizza was really good, loved all the cheese they put on top too."}
{"text":"This place has a great low key atmosphere. Servers were very personable. Pricing was reasonable. Food was amazing. Their pizza is delish. Would defiantly recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The worst service I've experienced in a while. We ordered two beers and waited 20 minutes then asked the waitress what was wrong she said the beers would be right out we waited another 10 minutes then left."}
{"text":"Rewind Feb 2016....3 stars...now4+  ReRanking after having become a semi-regular. No one tries harder with promotions, new beer and great attitude than this place. Especially the backbone of the fun, organization, and excited professionalism, Barb behind the well stocked bar.  The pizza and beef are good.  Lunch specials big plus, the salads have gotten much better.  From a sports bar perspective, it does outstanding. You can always count on the audio/volume of a Chicago team's game being played, or other NFL featured games....plenty of TVs and plenty of exciting old school cheering.  What baffles me is the limited kids menu,  I can't come here and get chicken strips and fries for my daughter we have to buy an entire appetizer of fries and an entire appetizer of chicken sticks,  seems with all the menu options available, a paper kids menu at least during the week would be a logical idea to bring in more families.  Right now it's spaghetti or pizza.  Kiddie beef slider and fries you say?  Well now I just convinced my brother-in-law to bring his seven-year-old with me and that means we're going to have four more drinks than we would have originally.....  All in all though, solid."}
{"text":"Tried this place out with a Groupon. We had thin crust with Italian sausage and wings. We came during a broadcast fight night for UFC and were blown away by the number of tvs and ample seating...it made for a great eating and viewing experience. Not a bad seat in the house.   This place would be ideal for sports viewing in the future. Nice staff."}
{"text":"The wife and I wanted a date night, and decided to give Rosati's another chance, and I must say I'm so glad we did! We ordered, the food came promptly, it looked great, and it tasted AMAZING! The lasagna was fantastic ( which says a lot since I'm super picky about sauce), the onion rings were perfect, and The deep dish cookie was beyond words amazing! Rochelle was our server and she was nice, she was quick, she was very friendly, PERFECT! After this visit I will definitely be coming back, probably frequently, and recommending Rosati's to everyone! If I could give more than 5 stars I would!"}
{"text":"We have been going to this Rosati's since it has been opened. The service is usually ok. Tonight the service was terrible. The server did not know the menu. We ordered the drink and a slice of pizza for the 5.00 special and also a salad. The server stated that the salad would be brought out first then the pizza slices. A few minutes later the pizza slices were brought to the table still with no salad. Tasted like mall pizza. My husband told the server to forget the salad. She was not happy with this request. The pizza had to have been sitting for quite a long time. Both were hard and barely warm. I only ate about a third of mine. The server never asked why I did not finish my piece of pizza. Guess she didn't care. Also had to keep asking her for sugar for the ice tea. She acted very put upon to give us the sugar. The manager never came by to see or ask what we thought about the meal. Guess he doesn't care either. Just a note the place was not busy at all. I am a rewards member, but will be a while until I use it."}
{"text":"Drove from California and met up with family from New Mexico and Mesa. First of all everyone was friendly and the service was great. Second the pizza was great it was one of the best tasting pizzas we've had in a long time. Very tasty!!! I recommend this place to everyone if your in Mesa"}
{"text":"There's nothing special about the sauce. Not tasty at all. The toppings were fine. The cheese is incredibly salty. All in all there's nothing that sets this pizza place apart. No pizzazz in the pizza."}
{"text":"Like a little piece of the Midwest in AZ. Show them your Cubs ticket stub. You'll be happy you did. Build your own pasta!  Came back a second time. Treat you like family. Lenten diet met. If your Cubs/Midwest you're family. Best place EVER"}
{"text":"My review is not about the food -- it is about the entertainment.  I love the band StreetLife/Lucious Parr. They have been playing here for the past 4 months.  I was here last Saturday and the music was so loud that I could not talk with the person sitting right next to me.  There was no dance floor room - and people come to dance to this great band.  Sorry, I won't be back."}
{"text":"A disgrace to Chicago pizza establishments! Went there on a Sunday, was severely understaffed. We waited nearly 30 min. for appetizers, and an hour for pizza.  Pizza dough was undercooked, and sauce was horrible.  Wings were okay.  We were handed our menus from some random guy sitting at the bar drinking a beer.  Also, we saw at least 5 people come directly in from the street, not wash their hands, and float in and out from behind the bar.  They were all wearing street clothes. One guy sitting at the bar, literally, leaned over the bar from his seat and poured himself a fountain drink.  All of these people either work there, and were off duty, or are regulars, as the bartenders seem to know them. Speaking of the fountain drinks, the hoses and spouts taste like they hadn't been cleaned in weeks! O, and one of the bartenders (wearing Dallas Cowboy attire) incessantly drank soda behind the bar, and btw, he was one of the people that never washed his hands.  Somebody needs to call John Taffer from Bar Rescue immediately. Stay away! Go to the Rosati's on Miller Road in Scottsdale.  They seem to have it figured out.  This place needs better management and oversite.  Don't allow this place to continue disgracing the good name of Chicago pizza."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. Lots of flavor and options throughout their dishes. We normally order take out and enjoy it at home. Really relaxed atmosphere inside if you prefer to eat out too. We typically grab pasta and the doughnuts with extra ranch. Great place, just a little heavy handed on grease sometimes."}
{"text":"I first came here a few weeks ago and the food was awesome. The bartender Brandon was fabulous and very attentive to me and my boyfriend. He definitely made good suggestions to get the double dough pizza, wings and the deep dish cookie for desert, all of which were amazing. He made our experience good enough for us to want to come back. We went again and this time we had Carson as our server. I was more disappointed this time. Carson never asked for refills, didn't recommend anything and there were several times I was seating there staring at him to get his attention and would look the other way and continue to watch the game on TV while rolling his silverware. Definitely felt like he was trying to get out of there rather than focus on the tables he had. Overall the food is good and the place is clean. If it weren't for the good experience with Brandon I probably wouldn't go back for sometime."}
{"text":"Ok, it seems that the pepperoni was a much better choice for the 8 inch pizza. The meat is still under the cheese, but with this topping, it is not on top also. They had a $3 Amber Bock beer special for the football game and plenty of seats at the back end of the bar. So, the free pizza was better, but the prices on most menu items are still too high. Will return for Happy Hour unless I find some more free pizza coupons."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely ridiculous. I'm about to write a story off of this one.   So I arrive the other day by myself hoping to get a simple sandwich after my long shift. I arrive and am immediately sat down and I think to myself \"cool it's empty so this should be fast\" .... Wrong. I ordered a simple sandwich and it takes an hour to come to me. No waitress in sight. So I'm getting a little flustered but I gave them the benefit of the doubt that maybe the beef I ordered was actually Kobe beef being directly imported from the rising sun nation of Japan.... Wrong again (off day) another 10 minutes pass and all I'm hearing is a manager yelling and swearing on the phone for whatever reason, Now I've been to a few synagogs (Jewish church for you uncultured kin) in my day; and what he was saying was not kosher whatsoever. Finally after having to baptize my ears because of that nonsense. Would not eat here again/10. needs new management/10."}
{"text":"Last time I was here the bartender was rude and he had no knowledge about drinks. The food was decent.. but none of that matters when your bartender/server comes off condescending on top of it all. Bad vibes."}
{"text":"This review has been sitting in my drafts folder for a while and is long overdo BUT I feel like with the experience I had with this location I needed to post it. I ordered a pizza at 7 o clock on a Friday night and was told it would be delivered within an hour. 8 o clock comes around... 8:20...... at 8:45 I called to check that my order was still being delivered and made it a point to note I placed my order at 7. The girl told me, \"Yeah! For Sarah right? It's on it's way out right now!\"  Okay, awesome (I thought). Had me nervous for a second.  9 o clock comes around.. mind you, I live very close to the restaurant. We are talking a 4 minute drive, barely over half a mile. At 9:30 I am justifiably irked and called the restaurant AGAIN and asked to speak with a manager. I was then placed on hold by an associate who told me she would be right over. She sounded weirdly nervous that I had called. Several minutes go by. By this time I believe they are waiting for me to hang up so they won't have to deal with the situation at hand. So I call back again... and after hearing whispers from the other end I was hung up on. Is this a joke? Unbelievable. I have never been so disrespected by a business in my life. After the FOURTH time calling them back the manager finally comes to the phone and half assed apologizes for my order telling me there's nothing she can do because it's almost 10 and she won't have any drivers available to deliver my pizza. They drug it out for 3 HOURS while I waited in hunger so they wouldn't have to deal with me. If they acknowledged their mistake sooner I could've ordered elsewhere. The worst excuse for service I have ever encountered in my life. No resolve, no sincerity, not even an offer of a discount for a future visit. Who in the actual fuck runs this place?"}
{"text":"This place is great! Not sure why they only have 3.5 stars... We go here all the time and it's one of our favorite sports bars in Old Town. Pizza is amazing! The restaurant has plenty of space with a cool bar and TV's everywhere. Great atmosphere to watch the game or take the entire family for pizza! Definitely a diamond in the rough. This is a fun place only the locals know about. Love it!"}
{"text":"First time we ordered for delivery was Tuesday.  It was so good we decided to order again Friday night.    Unfortunately,  the quality was inconsistent.   However, we like their pizza so we'll  go ahead and try them again."}
{"text":"I'm new to the Mesa area and ive always enjoyed Roasti's in Chandler so I decided to purchase a couple groupons for this location. First time I came in to pick up my order, no one was at the front desk and the bell they have there is broken. We waited for someone to ring us up and I showed them my groupon. Both times ive came here with my groupon coupons they accepted it but didnt really seem to know what groupon was or what the deal offered. Please educate your staff on groupon promotions your restaurant is involved in. Ive tried the pizza (pepperoni), bone in wings, mozzerella sticks (which are $6.99 for 6) and cheesey bread. All of these items were awful. Ive never been to a pizza restaurant and received food I absolutely didnt like anything about. Their ranch cups are 50 cents each and they are PREPACKAGED. So, no in house ranch. You get the same ranch cup youd receive at pizza hut. The wings looked odd and just gross, they were chunky and not appetizing. Pizza was like eating cardboard. And the cheesy bread was a joke. I was really hoping to like this place! But I will never be coming back. Its not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"Rosati's...actually a nice place. Great service! As a New Yorker eating Chigago pizza and saying anything nice about it is sacrilegious. However, their deep dish pizza is pretty good. Their fresh sauce; add basil as a topping it makes. a.difference. Never had an issue until my girlfriend wanted to have a thin crust pizza delivered. Get a clue thin crust pizza sucks and is worse when delivered cold! Well quess what? It was cold. Wonderful. I am an employer and i want to know when my product is not right..so i called and informed them. First i let them know that never had an issue before but i got smoke blown yup my ass. We can make you another pizza (but wait another hour) then our regular driver was in an accident (hope not fingers.crossed) but their regular driver delivered the pizza..bottom line is that heard the excuse for 40 years. I am from NY PLEASE. I even ordered extra cheese and toppings Just say sorry thin crust pizza sucks even if you deliver it hot . Guess what. Avoid delivery of thin crust pizza avoid thin crust pizza crust period. You also want to know something we do not have this problem with NY pizza. You make it right deliver it hot or you do not bother making .....sorry about your driver but your regular driver delivered the pizza..instead of delivering cold pizza you should have shut down delivery...but you chose to take my money and serve me GARBAGE. Guess what?  You lost me as a customer and i will tell all snow birds next spring traing to avoid you like the plague..also it is not about chicago or ny pizza it is that you are full shit..."}
{"text":"Although the pizza could have been better, the real winner was definitely the three cheese penne with garlic bread. The pasta was great and I would get it again for sure. Perhaps I should have gotten the deep dish pizza instead to get a better idea on their specialty pizzas?  I do have to say that the service was pretty incredible though. There was a lady who was working the bar area during the lunch hour who was extremely sweet and made sure everything was taken care of. I do wish the food came faster but I did like the atmosphere as well so that didn't bother me too much as I had time for my lunch to sit there for a while. For those in a hurry take-out would be a better idea instead."}
{"text":"I usually love the pizza I order from Rosati's, however, this might be the last time I return. We ordered a medium pizza half veggie and half cheese with extra ranch. Once the delivery guy got here there was no ranch and our pizza was completely wrong and tasted sub par. The pizza guy was completely unhelpful and when I called the store the person helping me out was unapologetic and just said we'd get a free pizza next time. There won't be a next time, that's for sure."}
{"text":"While semi-vacationing in Mesa for a national golf tournament I decided to order from this location less than 2 miles from my hotel at 6:30pm. I talked to a guy in training which already made me nervous about the outcome of my order and delivery as I used a coupon given to me by the hotel. I was told the pizza would be delivered within 45 mins. 45 mins later at 7:15 I received a phone call from another staff member claiming the oven \"wasn't working\" and that they were having someone come in (it's been 45 mins.... if the pizza hasn't been placed in the oven due to it not working why wasn't I notified then to figure something else out?) Anyway, I was in a patient mood and expressed my understanding... after all it's not their fault the oven broke down. The guy said it shouldn't take too long and they would still be able to get the pizza out. Well I called back around 8:10pm asking if the pizza was out for delivery or not. The staff member informed me the pizza was done but was waiting for the driver to come back to pick it up. So i think okay that shouldn't take too long and the pizza should be delivered in another 30-40 mins (WRONG). I call back at 9:10pm and the staff member working is confused because the driver should have \"delivered it already\" she informed me she would call the driver to figure out what's going on and then call me back about details (she never did). I am not a patient person by all means... however I continued to remain calm when I called back AGAIN to inform them I no longer wanted my pizza as I've been waiting almost 3 hours. The staff explained the manager wasn't there currently but wanted to take some of my information to credit me with something for the poor service/experience I had. Still waiting for a coupon or some incentive........."}
{"text":"Food was hot and accurate beer was cold however service was SLOW and inattentive waited ten mins for a beer while an entire restaurant was empty with 6 employees standing around! Smh need better Front end employees also I don't think it's sanitary to have your staff smoking in front of the restaurant in uniform looks like bad leadership to me"}
{"text":"The first time I went I had an absolutely terrible experience and never wanted to visit again. The food was amazing, but the service was down right bad, my husband had spoken with the manager and we were given a coupon to come back. I didn't want to come back, but my husband finally convinced me to go. I'm so happy I have them a second chance. We had the best waitress her name was Rochelle and she was on top of everything. Not only did Rochelle provide great service, she changed my entire view of rosatis! I would absolutely recommend this place to any one, the food is amazing and the service is great. I'm so happy I have them a second chance, they are now my favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had to drop a star based on food, service as alway was good.  Three recent visits first with the standard thin crust, passable but nothing special, 2nd visit someone ordered the double crust which doubled what wasn't my favorite quality of the thin crust it was dry and had no texture or flavor other than dry bread, yesterday I ordered a deep dish to see if I could snap the loosing streak...strike three, took nearly an hour but was told that ahead of time so no problem there but the crust was also dry and far from the butter crust as advertised.  On the positive side the ingredients for all three were of good quality, not greasy (at least on my non-meat side) and I wouldn't refuse a slice if offered but I probably wouldn't order pizza again."}
{"text":"We love their pizza and wings. We've been there in several occasions and had a really great meal plus we met the owners. Went there this past Saturday evening around 6 PM to enjoy pizza and drinks but left as soon as we got there. The speakers on the TV were turned up so loud - it sounded like a PA system. My ears were hurting!!! Geeez I can't eat in a place where I can't talk to my spouse. Sorry guys - if you are turning up the speakers that loud we won't be back."}
{"text":"Awesome find. The exterior of the building does not do it justice. Once you get inside, it is any Chicago lover's paradise. This is the best place to watch sports in Old Town. By the way, Jessica is the best. Sit in her section."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Ambiance is amazing and the food is killer!! Order some fettuccine allegro extra chicken and you got a party in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Came here to watch my coworker play music on a Saturday night. Ordered a salad and a pizza. I asked for a deep dish with Italian sausage and mushrooms. I got a pizza with sausage and no mushrooms but a few peppers and onions. I let the server know about the pizza not having mushrooms and she said there must have been a miscommunication. So she said she could take back the pizza and put some mushrooms on it. So they took back the pizza and gave me back my pizza with some not hot mushrooms on it. Pizza basically got cold. She said they were going to put it back in the over, and I doubt they did cause it wasn't warm when I got it back.  It's like they didn't even care. Terrible customer service. Server wasn't even sure on menu items. Won't be coming back here. Maybe a two star is too many stars."}
{"text":"Alright Rosati's, prepare for a stroking.   I have been coming here for months and don't know where to start. Most of this review will revolve around Barb. She has been absolutely amazing every single time I have been here. Originally from Illinois, I naturally gravitate to Rosati's but never have I thought of it as a bar. Barb completely changed that. Not only does she have my drink ready before I sit down but makes me feel like family every time I and my friends walk in with an ecstatic greeting! Slices for 3.50 during the day are great for a quick lunch as well.   The restaurant is adorned with TV's at every angle so if you miss any moment of your favorite sports event well, it would be your own damn fault. And if you have any questions about the vibe of the place you need only to open your eyes! Framed Butkis,Jordan, and Sosa jerseys line the walls to remind you of what team to root for .  Thanks Rosati's for being my spot in Old Town that feels like home!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and  a great place to watch games at. I have been waiting for years for them to finally finish opening ! Tons of TVs !!"}
{"text":"worst service ever on a Monday night football game night, lights bright,  server was the worst,  thanks to Sam the bar guy tried to help, but I would not come back"}
{"text":"This is exactly the kind of bar/restaurant I've been looking for since I moved to Arizona in 2003. It has everything you need for a sports fan. The TVs in this place are amazing! They are huge and they are everywhere!!!  The pizza here is perfect it was made exactly the way I like it!  I only had one issue and that is with the tap list. The tap list was out of date. I ordered three beers that were from the tap list that they didn't have. Then I walked over and looked at the taps and there were four beers that weren't on the printed list. If they could stay up to date on the tap list I would definitely move this up to a five star!"}
{"text":"Great Restaurant and Bar!  It's a bonus that is a Chicago Sports Bar!  I grew up in Chicago and had a small Rosati's a few blocks away and it has always been my favorite pizza!  I just moved to Scottsdale and was so excited to try in again.  I moved from Chicago over 20 years ago.....the pizza has gotten better!"}
{"text":"Delivery took Forever! AGAIN I find the notes I left for special instructions were NOT READ!!! I had grilled chicken caesar salad with yucky cold chicken! It was NOT GRILLED! With no dressing and no cheese! That's what happens when you do not read the notes people!!! Cheese bread & pizza were good... Cannoli \"yuck\"  For improvement! \"L\")"}
{"text":"Jessica (redhead) just brought in my crew of trainees and we had a blast!!! Love this place great service."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to watch sports & enjoy a cold beer! Food is excellent, haven't had a bad thing yet. Big Tv's lots of seating & a dog friendly patio- what's not to love!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have to take the time to write this review.  I just got off of a phone call with the GM Chris from the Mesa and Dobson location.  We are a family of 5, Mom, Dad and three small children.  We received coupons in the mail to try this pizza and the first time, it was very good.  We ordered the Godfather which was recommended and turned out great.  So last night we tried it again and to our dismay was beyond disappointed!!!!  It had a horrible after taste as if the red chilli peppers, parmesan or the giardinera were rotten, moldy or had just gone bad in some way!  We called immediately to make them aware of the situation and they came back with an offer of an eleven dollar credit after we spent close to $40 and almost $60 the first time vs. taking responsibility of what happened.  The manager Kevin promised we would receive a call back today from his GM Chris, which never happened.. We had to call back tonight to explain what happened to speak to the GM Chris and again unfortunately we were treated the exact same way as last night!  On top of that Chris said, I apologize you didn't get a call back, I told my am manager to call you and he never did.  Also dismissing any responsibility and almost denying what happened to us and trying to say this never happened before or could ever happen.  It's not about the credit it's about the responsibility and we would Never want this to happen to Anyone else!!  Today no one in our family felt right after last night's pizza dinner."}
{"text":"I usually order delivery or pickup as a weekly event. The last few weeks have been disappointing with regard to the pizza, which has been under cooked with soggy crust. I order well done, which hasn't been what I've received.  I had to find out what was happening, so this evening, I dined in. The pizza was done to order and amazing. Exactly what I expect every time. Unfortunately, the service was terrible. It wasn't busy, but I had to ask repeatedly for water and had to grab my own plates and silverware as no one prepared the table for the pizza which was delivered to me by someone from the kitchen and not the wait staff.  Ambiance is good, entertainment was great, (we like the Motown era), and of course, wall to wall sports.  I hope the staff remembers to take care of the regulars......we matter!"}
{"text":"Let me start by making it clear I'm giving them 2 instead of 1 star because they dog friendly and pizza taste amazing!! But their service alone takes a pub that should be extremely enjoyable down lower then a 1 star!!!! Me my boyfriend and 2 dogs went to rosati's couple weeks ago because we had a Groupon for dine in only so we sit on the patio and after about 15 min of not being greeted ( even though there was another family sitting outside with a server ) we went in and let some one know we were out side (we had to do this twice before someone finally came to take our order) since we had been sitting so long we knew exactly what we wanted and put in the full order 2 drinks fried pickles and a pizza no joke that's all!!! Well we get our drinks and pickles then about 1 hour and 45 min go by and no pizza so we ask to please check on pizza and they said should be out shortly we'll almost another 30 min go by and still no pizza!!! Remover folks this is a PIZZA PUB ITS LITERALLY THEIR MAIN FOOD OPTION well Their excuse was another server must have taken it. So the manager was nice enough to take the pizza off the tab so we returned the favor and did not use the Groupon and decided to give them another try ( big mistake) last night we went rosati's again me my bf and 2 dog sit on patio wait about 15 min then finally get greeted, we put in our full order at once (same as the time before) now this time it takes over 30 min before we get our 2 beers and by that point there is no reason on ordering anymore drinks because our food should come shortly after!! This time the food didn't take as long but we were still there over 2 hours! Well this too me we used our Groupon and learned a valuable lesson ONLY CARRY OUT OR DELIVERY unless you want to waste your whole evening on horrible service and a bad experience!!"}
{"text":"Bomb food, bomb people. Went here without reading reviews and very happy I did. I ordered the ravioli and it was delicious! Service was phenomenal not to mention they had sports going on all the tvs around me. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would! This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had with ordering food. The delivery driver couldn't find my apartment. I had to talk to him for 15 minutes to try and give him directions to my apartment. He sounded and seemed under the influence to be honest. Then when I finally got my food I tried the Tiramisu and it was spoiled and smelled like rotten milk. I was so sick to my stomach after that I couldn't even touch the rest of my food. When I called to see what they could do they said they couldn't refund anything but could write my name down and give it to the owner when he came in, the person I talked to was very rude and hung up on me. I've never been treated like this by an establishment before and would never give them my money again. I payed $50 dollars tonight for nothing but anxiety and an empty stomach! Don't order from here! Save your money for somewhere that actually cares about the food they serve you."}
{"text":"The food is.... fine. Nothing wrong with it, nothing to brag about. But the service is insanely bad.  The waitresses may do nothing wrong, maybe it's the kitchen, not sure, but of the two times I've been here it's taken well over an hour to get my food.  Maybe I'll come back and just bring a sandwich in my purse for the wait?"}
{"text":"Service was great. It looks brand new. I got the cheesy bread and it tasted great. The marinara was tasty too. There are HD TVs everywhere playing all sorts of sports. It's Chicago themed, which I don't like but there is some AZ stuff in there. We got the all meat pizza and it was great. Cooked just right with high quality toppings. It was upscale pizza but not too fancy to where it was ritzy. I would come back."}
{"text":"I'll be nice and start w the goods:  The pizza is good although expensive.  The wings are delicious. I love that they can deliver wine and beer w your order  The bars: Dinned in the restaurant twice and service has been so slow. Waited 15 minutes for our drinks. Waiter may be inexperienced and needs better training. 30 minute wait for wings and 45 minutes for the pizza.   Thank God I had my friends with me to keep me from loosing my hangry mind!"}
{"text":"Ordered one 12 inch and a 16 inch pizza at 10pm on a Thursday. Took nearly 45min to get the food. 3 out of 4 of our drinks were empty never got a refill."}
{"text":"So I feel that it's safe to say I give up on Rosatis pizza at Dobson & the 202( Riverview). On two different occasions I've called & we've waited up to 2 hours for our pizza. Another time, the food came cold. For that, I received a $25.00 credit ( which I actually forgot that we had). I decided to give it another shot(after several months) & that pizza, surprisingly, was delivered ok. However, this time, after 45 minutes, this is what was delivered to our door! What the hell is this?! Either they don't know how to place the pizza in a box properly or Mario Andretti was the delivery driver! I called, understandably upset, & was assured by the Manager, Chris, that I would get a new complete order within 30 minutes or less. An hour later, the pizza finally arrives( only the pizza, not the complete order)greasy & the cheese looks like it was placed on the crust. I called the manager again only to be held on hold for 10 minutes to which I was told it was very busy & to call back in an hour or two. I have officially given up on this place! It's shit & the pizza has become shit!  What's even funnier, I was told by the delivery driver who delivered the redo pizza that \"this has NEVER happened before\", meanwhile a post from 22 days ago shows a pizza that showed up in worst condition that ours did! This place is a joke!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, after multiple visits to this location, the customer service seems to have only worsened. If you want Rosati's pizza, you're better off calling it in.  Waitresses were busy mingling (literally sitting at tables chatting) with patrons, and then after their shifts (I hope) drinking at the bar. All the while, our pizza took much longer than most establishments to come out.   We had come to watch the UFC fights and had to ask on three different occasions for ONE of their 20 TV's to be changed.   It was also 55 degrees outside after a weekend of cold rain in early January, and the garage door that apparently serves as a dual entrance was wide open for the entirety of our 4-hour visit. If you didn't bring a jacket and gloves, you were screwed. And if you expected to eat warm food, you were screwed.  Also, the lighting here is overwhelming for a restaurant/bar. The unnatural bright white interrogation-style lighting is obnoxious to the point of eye irritation. As petty as that might sound, it's definitely the first thing you notice upon arrival... and won't forget.  Overall, not a recommended hang out for drinks. Not a recommended restaurant for dine-in pizza. But if you want a decent tasting and decently-made pizza, call it in and pick it up, or maybe have it delivered."}
{"text":"We went to Rosati's to catch the last half of the Bears's game. We got there and they didn't have any tables inside so they sat us outside ... it was hot but there were misters so it was Bear(able). Anyway, the hostess told us that our waitress was notified and will be out shortly. Two mins go by... no one... five ... nope... 10 ... nada ... so I call them on the phone, a male voice answered and immediate asked (welll... told ... really) me to hold, 6 mins later. I hang up. My significant other calls and immediate put on hold as well but the guy came back on the phone 2.5 mins later. My SO told him that we've been waiting for more than 15 mins and no one has come out to serve us. The guy apologized and said that he would let someone know asap. Five mins later, our waitress comes out, apologizes for the miscommunication that they had and takes our order. The mushroom and sausage thin pizza came out quickly. We ate... no sign of the waitress again. We asked for the check when she resurfaced and she brought that out quickly.   The pizza was actually pretty good but the service was atrocious!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, clean restaurant, lots of TVs to catch a game or sports updates. There were only 3 tables including us and Water was empty for a while twice but still a very pleasant experience. Server and manager were extremely nice. Gonna come back and try to catch a game!"}
{"text":"Rosati's is actually closed. Changed to sweet home Chicago. Still do Chicago style pizza and bbq. Haven't tried it yet tho."}
{"text":"Honestly I went in and came right back out. 90% of the restaurant was full of seniors and this was on a Friday evening. Wasn't that busy either :("}
{"text":"This place is not bar, it's a place for beer, not liquor. I asked for a Bacardi & coke in a short glass, they didn't have any clean short glasses. The bartender offered to serve it in a copper mule, then he realized they don't serve Bacardi rum. So I asked for a Patron on the rocks, sorry no Patron! The manager was to busy to come out of the back, the owner wants to cut back on the liquor they stock. He's also cutting back on customers returning."}
{"text":"Yes! They got it right! I had been here 3xs because it was right by my house and every time I was disappointed. Food was good but service sucked and $7 craft beers is ridiculous. Gave it one more shoot and man I'm glad I did! Good craft beers down to $4 (excellent move) and the service from Amber was exceptional. And, as always, the food was great. Thanks for redeeming yourselves Rosaties!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Delicious salads , \"dough bites\", meatball Parmesan sandwich !!! , Lots of TV's!!! Let's support this new place!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Very good pizza but disappointed in sandwiches.  Ordered a chicken Parmesan sandwich and it was a piece of breaded chicken on a hamburger bun, not what we were expecting.  They need to step it up in that department before we order sandwiches again!"}
{"text":"Went to Cubbies bar to enjoy game 7 of the World Series.  While the food was good, the service tonight was absolutely horrible. I waited 20 minutes to get served after sitting at the bar, and never got a chance to order a second beer. I tried to order for 20 minutes before finally giving up, then waiting another 30 minutes to have my check run. I was hoping for a good experience on my first visit, but unfortunately was left disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife and LOVE the food here, it's why we've been back several times, despite sub-par service. Our experience on 12/23 was different, and when we asked for the manager's contact info we were told there were too many managers and they didn't have business cards. Here are the notes I took that night: -Wing flavors came out wrong from the kitchen -No celery or carrots with the second order -Blue cheese packets were expired by two weeks with an expiration date of 12/9/16, after we brought it to their attention they served a 2nd cup with the same expiration date -Manager never came to check on us after the order was wrong the first time -Employees congregated and ate at the bar right next to us and they left unaccompanied food for nearly an hour -Roll of Garbage bags being stored in the silverware trays -Cup o'noodles stored next to the coffee maker -Employees bad mouthing a third employee who was not present about calling another employee because she needed to go home sick -Employee beverages stored next to the refill ice tea and water pitchers -Employee discussing a messed up take-out delivery order in front of customers -I ordered PBR to drink and my bartender served $3, 16 oz cans rather than the posted $2 PBR pints \"all day every day\". -Server scratched her head with her bare hand right before serving food to guests with that same hand"}
{"text":"Just had food delivered from this location.   Pizza had a little too much of everything on it and toppings slid all to one side which is not the end of the world, accidents happen.   The main problem with the pizza being overloaded was the fact that it didn't really taste too great.   I think it would've been better had it not been drowned with ingredients.  So, we ate a bit and tossed in the trash, no saving this one for lunch the next day.  The only other thing we ordered was a $7.99 cookie.  The damn thing was burned (included picture) which just topped off this annoying restaurant encounter.  I don't trust a restaurant that sends its food to customers looking totally burned.   I mean come on,  have some pride in your work.      Won't be back."}
{"text":"Oh no, what have I done??! I ordered delivery before reading the reviews. We haven't had Rosati's Pizza in a while and I was craving some slices. Now I'm waiting anxiously hoping to prove the negative reviews false. Here I thought ordering delivery was a way to reduce dinnertime stress. To my surprise, our order has arrived hot AND earlier than the quoted 45-60 minutes window! Edges were a little crisper than expected but Rosati's has been full of surprises today. Great job!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer of this location for awhile now and this is my first review, in the beginning the establishment was pretty good, after using the delivery service (Uber & Direct) I am sad to say that the business is not up to par, the delivery has failed on many occasions and my visits to the establishment is not good, I have had some good visits but as of late I would never recommend this establishment for the cusine (sorry), it's just not good anymore, I was very disappointed with my last couple of encounters, delivery and visits, I have no idea what happened, I hope they can get back in the game."}
{"text":"Let me make a short review. +very clean +food taste good +ingredients seems fresh +portion are big +flavor is delish! +workers are friendly  Would likely to comeback!!!"}
{"text":"The jalapeno bread and garlic bread is very tasty. The thin crust pizza is very good. They make very strong cocktails. I had ordered a cocktail which had blue curacao and a hint of lime. It's name was purple something and the vodka content was on  the higher side So if  you are ordering a cocktail let them know your preferences."}
{"text":"So we were in Tempe for Spring Break and needed some late night food delivered to our complex. I used the YELP ordering system and it worked out BRILLIANTLY! I cannot say enough positive things about the way were ordered & how YUMMY the food was!   I browsed thru Rosati's menu & easily picked what we wanted. (salads, wings & pizza) The yelp app made it super easy! I was sent to a link where I could watch my order being received, made & the delivery time. They quoted me about 45 minutes and it was delivered in perfect time. The pizza was fabulous. I love trying different pizzas! We ordered the Hawaiian one with the bbq/marina sauce. YUM! The bbq wasn't over powering and the pizza was cut into squares and we devoured it.   I would def order from here again, and I would love to go in and actually see the restaurant! GREAT job YELP & Rosati's! A pool side pizza dinner we will never forget!"}
{"text":"This location needs to drop the advertisement on their delivery service AND that they deliver beer or wine!  In the last two months they have not had anyone over 21 to deliver which means they can not deliver the alcohol with the food.  PLUS, they only have one driver on duty when ever I have called in a order.  It takes 1-2 hours on average, the food is cold once delivered and I am only 4 blocks away!!  I guess I could go in myself, but for convenience I don't mind paying the delivery fee and tipping the driver but so far the management seems to cheap to hire more drivers esp on weekends!! OR too cheap to pay enough so that someone 21 can drive when it has an alcohol order.   False advertising."}
{"text":"Been there a number of times I'm from Chicago thank God they got some Chicago food here but great service good food try the pizza that's awesome"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and come back for the food but service is some of the worst I've ever had.  I think they have lime 3 people for a 150 seat restaurant.  They mean well but once our pizza took an hour and a half.  We have waited to pay for 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Get the right Pizza recipe from Rosatis on Scottsdale and Shea. Ur not good!!!!!  It doesn't make sense. I rate them a 10 and you a. 2   Contact Jesse @ that location for thin and thick. They have original recipes and you don't. Do yourself a favor."}
{"text":"was there Sunday lunch during a soccer tournament. 3 tables in the restaurant, 55 minutes to get the food. they forgot the bacon in the kids pizza, tried to charge me for a kid drink included in the menu. the Chicago deep pizza was the worst ever. it was like a fake crust with fake tomato sauce on the top. a real joke. $ 7 for beer!, another waste of money and time in a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Sad to I say I am disappointed! I have been here on 2 different occasions and was satisfied, but today I just have to post my disappointment. I ordered hot wings, and they came out cold. I figure I'm not going to complain and order a small pizza and be happy. Not the case, pizza was not at my table after an hour. Now I started to worry so I ask my waitress to check on my pizza. She came out with my pizza and yes it was cold too!!! I know it it's busy tonight and I can understand but it's not cheap here, is expect better for my $$. I'm ashamed to post this but people should know!"}
{"text":"This place is brand new and they did a great job with the decor.  It's a nice big open space with a huge bar and a ton of TVs.  The employees were all very nice and friendly.  The food is just average.  The boneless wings reminded me of chicken tenders and are a good deal if you get them on happy hour prices.  The three cheese penne pasta dish was a soupy mess.  My thin crust pizza with sausage was OK and I'd order it again occasionally in the future.  They do have a pretty good craft beer selection which will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch today ( Thurs ).....the Sweet Italian dressing calls your name , it's that good ! Meatballs are consistently good...superb service, and a meeting w/ the GM, who went out of his way to make us feel welcome.....we'll be back !!!"}
{"text":"Was seated immediately. Waited for 15 minutes at our booth and nobody even asked if we wanted drinks. Left because we couldn't get served. Smelled good but I can't give it anymore stars since I never got to order food."}
{"text":"Server was rude, argumentative, and the golden rule of the customer is always right definately did not apply at this place. The pizza was unimpressive, and the service was awful. Definately will not be returning."}
{"text":"Huge portions! I had the 3 Cheese Baked Penne and fiancé had a calzone. Food wasn't bad and definitely lots of leftovers for me. The booth wasn't very comfortable and there were some flying bugs that wouldn't leave my wine alone. Not a great drink selection."}
{"text":"It's not even worth trying. NOT like other Rosatis around the valley. Ridiculous customer service- management is non existent- & pizza was terrible. Don't even try."}
{"text":"After spelling my address out MULTIPLE times the person taking orders still gave the delivery person the wrong address. So 40 minutes past the delivery time we finally got our pizza. Not that I was very hungry after an hour and half... And it's a good thing I wasn't because the pizza was terrible. Here's the breakdown: Very little sauce with very little flavor.  The \"double bough\" was just two crust literally laid on top of each other and was a cardboard texture Oh ya, half our pizza was MISSING cheese. Like it looked like a dog just grabbed it and ran The wings were undercooked and day glow orange that tasted straight from Chernobyl  And now I'm hunched over in the bathroom with the worst stomachache I've had in the better part of a decade.   AVOID AT ALL COSTS...  Now for an update:  So after waiting on hold for a manager for over 10 mins, I told the manager I just wanted him to know about my exceptionally poor experience. After many excuses about a new person taking orders and blah blah he then proceeds to tell me that we couldn't \"get sick\" from the wings because they are \"precooked and we just reheat them\" WHAT IN THE ACTUAL F$&K?! Do you take a food handlers card? Do you know how bacteria grows?! I was blown away. Like are you really going to argue with me?!   Now for the kicker; here's how they tried to resolve things.  1. Offer me an $18 credit for a future purchase. - REALLY? You couldn't even offer me the full price I paid which was $22. Come on!  2. Then he said instead he could send us over another order and \"trade in the food\". I mean my jaw dropped to the ground. Trade the food in?! Like what do you can re-sell it?? Oh and did you miss me telling you how sick I feel?!   This totally solidified my firm stance of never EVER going there again."}
{"text":"My parents go out for pizza every Sunday, and my husband and I were \"visiting\" from Denver last weekend.  (\"Visiting\" in quotes, because we are actually down here about every other month.). This Sunday, no exception - PIzza.  We are always eager for where they pick (we of course, let me them select.). Rosati's Pizza Sports Pub?  Really?  What the hell is that?  Is it a Rosati's or is it a Sports Pub.  Could they pull off both?  Rosati's in my mind is a small step up from traditional pizza-chains; but a larger step up from standard delivery and take-out favorites.  Enter - the first impression at this new location.  HOLY CRAP - this is not a Rosati's.  It's a sports bar!  More seating and TV's than many of the other spots, an amazing full \"round\" bar in the center with amazing views of the TV's, and more than ample seating!  The place is far larger than it looks from the outside, and spotless.  Spotless.  Not sterile, just clean, clean, clean.  Big-ass Blues Brothers in the center of the bar, which is right out of the gate, eye-catching, and eye-candy if you aren't glued to the TV.  The place wasn't crowded, so wasn't too loud, but I can tell you, the TV's also weren't blaring.  I can't stand when you are in a sports-bar on a fairly calm night, and you can't even hear yourself think.    Food - as is the usual \"Italian Sunday Dinner\" we ordered enough food for a third world country.  Two apps, two large salads and two pizzas.  Sadly, I am not kidding.  The apps came out quickly, and for once, the deep fried mushrooms were NOT loaded with grease and so hot you couldn't eat them until they had cooled to the point of being congealed.  The salads were more than ample, and a perfect mix of greens, not just iceberg, and LOADED with items as described on the menu.  (If you see my other posts, you know how picky I am about salads, and these hit and exceeded the mark.). The dressings were light and fresh, and everything was properly chilled and natural.  Both were presented quite well!  The pizzas were really delicious.  I hate to sound surprised, but I think I had \"mediocre\" expectations.  Many properly scattered, intensely flavored toppings with the perfect balance of cheese and sauce.  The crust was cooked perfectly, not burnt on the edges or soggy in the center and HOT when served!  Three woohoo's for HOT!  Everything was timed perfectly - salads delivered as we were finishing our appetizers; pizza delivered as we were finishing our salads.  So how did these four people fit all that darn food on a table?  Did they sit at an 8 top?  Nope, Nope, Nope.  Just a 4-top. Thanks to our outstanding, attentive, customer service oriented server Jessica - who was mindful to quickly remove empties (but not too soon) - she brought a nearby empty small table near us, for the pizza-pies!  We called it our \"wing-table.\"  (This should really be embarrassing, but I can't stop typing.)  Clean bathrooms?  Check Server sense of humor?  Check Good beer list?  Check (We'll prove it soon at happy hour) Hot food?  Check Inviting atmosphere?  Check Management presence?  Check Reasonable prices for ample portions?  Check  Looks like we have a winner folks in a ridiculously wonderful location."}
{"text":"Nice Italian Pizza place, enjoy the live music and pizza. Service is hit or miss, but the place is very clean and generally a nice informal place to chill."}
{"text":"Great bar. The place has fantastic televisions for watching games. Pizza is very good.  The owner was very pleasant and clearly wants to make sure the customer is happy.  If I lived in the area, I would come here to watch football this fall."}
{"text":"I just had a very poor customer service experience at this location.  I went to pick up my order and planned on paying in part with a $25 gift card that I've never used before. The girl swiped the card and said it had a zero balance and then looked at me. I said, I don't know I got it here. She called over the manager who swiped it again and reaffirmed that it had a zero balance and she looked at me just like the first girl. I said again, I don't know but I got it here. I explained that we won the card as a 2nd place prize on their trivia night and the guy told us the dollar amount on the card.   After I gave as much info as I could remember about the night we got won gift card, since it had been a while, the manager searched through their database and couldn't find the card. She said she could honor the card for an amount less than what we were told it was worth. She added that they don't give $25 prizes for for 2nd place anyways. I didn't know what to say because I wasn't lying. I just know what I was told when I got the card.  I've worked in restaurants and retail enough to know that in a situation like that you should take the customer for their word. I wasn't being suspicious or rude. I just told them what I was told.  All in all, I like the food but my family will never come back to this location."}
{"text":"Awful service. Our food came out over 30 minutes apart, we ordered at the same time. The waitress never came back to check on us in that interval so I couldn't tell her how nasty it was. I ate 3 bites and told her to take it off the bill, she said well, you ordered it. The waitress told us if we got an 18 inch pizza the 12 inch would be free, it wasn't. She had to be flagged down to refill our drinks. Elizabeth was a much better waitress but unfortunately we didn't get her. Also there was a loud alarm going off every few minutes."}
{"text":"I'm gonna start with the good. The beer is good, the wings are pretty good. Now the bad; If you get the wings get it to go, and make some ranch because they have packaged ranch. I've never seen that at a pizza/wing place. Seriously, make ranch in house, I don't want pre-packaged ranch.   About 10 minutes after being sat, I began feeling stinging on my feet (flip flops), I knew I was being bit by something. When I looked there was a whole bunch of ants under our table. They were biting me the whole time!!   Surprisingly, I was pretty cool about it. Hey, it can happen. However, I expected an apology from the manager. Nope. He was shown the ants, walked right by our table to grab something to clean them up, and went to get rid of them. He walked by our table a few more times, but didn't speak to us once! An apology would have been nice.   Let's get to the service. Our server was actually very sweet. Unfortunately, she was too sweet to talk to her manager about giving us a discount. Oh, not because of the ants. Our food came out completely staggered. There were ONLY five of us. They brought out the pizza first. The two that ordered that ate about half of it before my wings and another plate of pasta was brought out. Than they realized that something wasn't right. Our last plate of food and my fries came out once we were all pretty much done eating. In my opinion, if we come to eat in house and we have to ask for the food to go, we should not have to pay for it.   Again, the manager never visited our table. Nothing."}
{"text":"This place is good... there pizza (godfather) is to die for... it's so good... lots of flavors that just melts in ur mouth...u should also try there pasta.. can't remember the name but it has chicken on it... it's so good.. and there portion is big!! So if ur a big eater this is ur place... and the wings are good too.."}
{"text":"I like this place but...I wanted to watch the game Saturday. The bar stools were full but there were several empty tables. We were told those were for parties of 4 or more. All those empty tables...a shame I had to take my $100 and go to Zipps and spent it there."}
{"text":"A \"sports\" bar that stops playing sports to play trivia.  We've been here 7-8 times since the switch from Chances Are.  The bar hasn't recovered since the water bottle in the purse clientele started showing up.  Avoid this location if you want to see your team."}
{"text":"I love them and the food is good but when I ordered from them they forgot my pizza! He brought the wings and bread but not the pizza haha. I wasn't mad, just shocked lol."}
{"text":"Love this place...pizza is awesome. Just disappointed in the serving size of the French fries. Less amount than a small McDonalds fry...and 3 times the price. The fries taste great too...but why so skimpy...every time I try them?!?!"}
{"text":"Bill and Kathy, please see my review of Sweet Home Chicago on that page. Your current management team need to go. We have been regulars for 2 years but we won't be back unless the management team is replaced."}
{"text":"This new Rosati's Sports Pub has taken over the former Chances Are bar on the N/W corner of 6th Ave and Miller in S Scottdale. First of all, I'd like to say thanks for thinning out the gaggle of stool pigeons that had previously gathered there.  The interior was open and comfortable with a great full bar in the center. The booths were comfortable and everything clean and new.  A co-worker and I decided to stop for lunch on a recommendation that they were a PD-Friendly establishment. We were instantly greeted and seated. I'll talk about the food first and get that out of the way:  They serve Pepsi, contrary to the menu, which I vehemently disagree with. When asked \"is Pepsi ok?\", I instantly respond \"is Monopoly money ok?\". At least they have good old D.P. to hold me over. The carbonation was perfect. We ordered the fried mushrooms to start. They were hot and plentiful, with little to no grease. I ordered the thin crust lunch pizza, with pepperoni, mushrooms and black olives. The sauce was perfect. A good amount of cheese. The crust was brown and crisp,  with still enough chew. The flavor was great. My misinformed cohort thought that it was somehow acceptable to put Canadian bacon and pineapple on a pizza. I won't tell you where I buried her body, but before I berated her to death, she said that her pizza was great.  Ok, so let me move onward to the service review. Our server was a nice gal by the name of Alexandra. She was bubbly and friendly, but not 'Brian from Chotchky's' annoying. She took our appetizer order and it seemed to come back right away. Our drinks came instantaneously. Without asking,  she brought us separate cups of ranch, which was thoughtful. I mean, who knows if my co-worker is a double-dipper? That would be ludicrous. The food came quickly, and she was on refills of beverages like lightening. Before my straw could make the slurp noise, there was another right there. I must have looked like I was getting full, because right when I was thinking \"box time\", Alexandra was there with boxes and a to-go drink.   In all of my days eating out, Alexandra was probably the BEST service I've ever had. Like EVER. In the history of restauranting. She does a really great job, and seems to enjoy her work. I really hope that Rosati's utilizes her talents to train other staff. I think even corporate should make note. Her service and disposition are what every business should aspire to for their staff. This girl is on fire! But then again, if she gets promoted, she wouldn't be there to be my server..."}
{"text":"I ordered an extra thin classic combo 18\" pizza. It's very unfortunate, because the owners are very good people and I hate to see their business killed because of a \"cook\" who just doesn't give a damn!  Quality does matter!"}
{"text":"I come here often for the Chi-town feel! It's amazing memorabilia on the walls along with the Blues Brothers in the center of the bar. The service from Kristen is awesome and Johnny adds that \"Outsider\" feeling...lol Great place for sports and brew, however they fired the best bartender ever, Kristen, which is the primary reason I went as often as I did. Sucks that happened. They will lose in the long run. I won't go back. I will find another Chicago bar"}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing! We will be back. Cannolis were really good too, and the service was good. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Probably my favoritve sports bar in Oldtown Scottsdale! They have so many TVs i couldnt even count them all! The wait staff was friendly and inviting. And you cant forget the food. Definitely my favorite pizza in town but there is more than just pizza. I have never been dissapointed by what I've ordered. Oh and can't forget its a Chicago bar! The Sunday brunch specials are top notch during the football season. They have bottomless bloodies and mimosas, bbq, and great breakfast options."}
{"text":"We will no longer come here. There is a high pitch wine that hurts our whole family's ears.  The staff says they don't hear anything. This time we ordered garlic bread. It was half of piece of bread ( 2 small individual pieces about 3 inches ) and it cost $4.00! Every time we go there, there  is something wrong. No coke, no mot. Sticks ect..."}
{"text":"New place only open for 1 week. Great food. They are working through some new opening issues, but don't be afraid because the food is great! Nice people too. I had meaty buffalo wings with delicious blue cheese. Also a small Chicago pizza with sausage, pepperoni, olives and banana peppers. Thick and really good and I could only eat 2 slices. Bring a friend. Nice beer selection and lots of TV's with games on. Small selection for cocktails, but some specialty drinks that look good. I will return on my next business trip to AZ."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game and the food is outstanding. They have good happy hour specials and it's never to crowded."}
{"text":"I stopped into this place during my visit to Phoenix and loved it. I'm a Chicago native and loved the pizza here. I had the sausage and beef combo pizza, let me tell you, if you have had sausage on pizza in Chicago, you will know that this is the real deal. I even came back the next day for breakfast! I had the Godfather omelet and it was fantastic. Breakfast was huge, had enough to take home for later. I would definitely recommend this place. It is awesome. The bar is huge and there are tvs everywhere which is cool."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quickie lunch since we were in the area. Very clean and quite big. We were the only customers so was a bit skeptical. But the servers were great and overall a great lunch. I had the Penne Pasta and Wifey got the 12 inch White Pizza. Both were great and would recommend."}
{"text":"UPDATE: My credit card still has not been refunded as of April 30th for the charged amount of $28.09 on April 7th. The Manager even replied to my review on here stating how I will be refunded but never followed through which is not surprising. The line item on my credit card statement shows \"04/07 ROSATIS OLD TOWN LLC SCOTTSDALE AZ 28.09\".  It was indeed charged to my account.  One of the most bizarre customer service situations I have ever experienced. At one point (still am to some degree), I was concerned about being victim to credit card fraud. I called the number for this location at 5:21pm Friday, April 7th. I ordered a 14''  two topping deep dish and ravioli. I provided my home address (2 miles away) for the delivery. I paid over the phone with my credit card information. I was quoted $42 and charged for the order.  I was told the order should arrive in 45 minutes which is standard for most places in my area if ordering before 5:30. My order was placed at approximately 5:25pm. All is well.  6:35 rolls around and the pizza has not arrived - 25 minutes past the estimated delivery time. Okay, no problem that happens sometimes. I called to check on my delivery order status. I was told they did not have an order for my address or under my name, and how people are told to expect at least an hour wait. They said let me check with my manager and placed me on a brief hold, then proceeded to state I hung up on them before my original order was placed. I explained to them I do not know who insinuated I hung up on them and how I was asked for my address, charged for the order, and given an estimated delivery time... apparently I was expected to stay on the phone for the full 45 minutes or someone made a mistake and wanted to blame me instead.  Getting weird. Yet, let's just get the order taken care of. However, thus far no intention on their behalf to resolve anything nor get the order delivered as soon as possible. They continue to tell me they do not have the order, so I retort I want to ensure I am not charged.  They place me on hold. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting some more. 6-7 minutes passes no response. I hang up and call back. Waiting music. Call back again. Waiting music. Call back again. Waiting music. Call back and this time the call goes through and someone answers. I explain how I was placed on hold and no one returned to speak to me. Admittedly, I am getting outwardly frustrated by this point. This person (different than the person on the first call) asks for my personal information again to figure out the problem and places me on hold. 8 minutes go by. Getting extremely frustrated  waiting this long a second time complete disregard for me as a customer. I hang up to get someone on the phone again. I proceed to call roughly 7 times in a row where each time someone answers I request not to be put on hold again (surely, I am losing patience) and the person from the first call states \"Rosati's please hold\" every single time; even though, she knew it was the same customer with the order mishap who has already been waiting over 20 minutes. She clearly did not care and wants me to go away, but I am still the same customer who now has a misplaced order from 90 minutes ago (45 minutes past the estimate) and a pending charge that is not being handled. This is when in the back of my mind I begin to worry if the number I called 480-999-5400 is putting up a front  as the Rosati's Old Town pizza location in order to fraud people into providing their credit card customer.  Unfortunately or fortunately (depending on one's perspective), the number appears to be correct for the location. On my last call just after 7pm (call 13 for the night), a person who seems to be a manager answers the phone. In a very frustrated tone and no longer remaining polite, I explain my dismay of the situation and how 30 minutes later my order could have already been delivered by now. Instead, I was placed on hold multiple times then completely ignored in the end. By this time, I already confirmed on my credit statement a charge for $25.09 had been placed from Rosati's Old Town (no idea how $42 became $25 for the charge - someone just messed up, which is fine we all make mistakes m, but didn't want to take accountability and chose to make my evening very difficult). The manager, or at least the individual who represented their self as a manager, said they have my phone number and will call me when they receive confirmation my charge has been cancelled.   Never once an apology or a simple sorry for the inconvenience. Unreal experience. I will need to keep a close eye on my credit card charges until or if I receive a phone call confirming the charge was reverted. But hey, ending up getting Streets of New York instead -- delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place for sports and even greater for the food!! Well worth passing Zipps for a sports bar experience!!"}
{"text":"Sad, being an avid Chicago fan but the last 2 times I've been there, I asked to get Comcast Chicago, waitress went to bartender.....he seemed bothered by the request; she continued to try(I guess he was the only one registered in tv ).  Bottom line, no tv movement and I left.  Went to Clancys and immediately got my game and the food and service were great.  I tried again recently, ordered a glass of wine from waiter, same dweeb bartender, no drink forthcoming, was going to have pizza ...... the kid must feel a power rush at his position.   Merely a punk to me.  No more Rosatis, Miller rd for this Chicago fan.  One star for food and the exasperated waitress who tried."}
{"text":"We came for the wings, and to check the place out right after it opened.It is adecent upscale sports bar, There were a lot of people ther, so I bet they will do okay, The wings were a couple bucks too much but tasted great and were crispy and hot. Beer was cold and bartender (female) was good."}
{"text":"Even though they screwed up our pizza they fixed it no problem and got the right one to us quick , not to mention the pizza was great"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet! I remembered this bar when I was looking for a good bar to watch the Cubbies take that W and let's just say this place became my 3rd home (after real home and work). I was there for practically every game, except for the one I was in Chicago for! I became a regular after just 3 times of being there and the bartenders know how to work it! I'm not just talking about the service they gave me, but how attentive they were to everyone. Yes, there were busy days (like Game 7 of the WS), where they were so slammed that everyone's heads were spinning and yet they didn't rest. It's a fun time to be a bartender and when you're busy that's when it's the best just hammering out those cocktails! The pizza here is decent, but I will say you can pass on the Gyros (nothing to write home about). Oh and if you didn't know about their rewards make sure you sign up!"}
{"text":"The food was bad and the service was absolutely terrible. Our server never came by to check and see how everything was, she was more concerned with BS-ing with the kitchen staff at the window and texting than doing her job. It was our first and last time going there."}
{"text":"First of all, this is no longer Rosati's. It's now called Sweet Home Chicago. The food itself was adequate, nothing special. The service, however, was atrocious. Our server did take our order promptly but she dropped off our drinks and disappeared. My husbands drink order was wrong and we had to flag down the hostess to get it corrected because our server was no where to be seen. Our appetizer came...and then it was all down hill. After almost 45 minutes of waiting, being ghosted by our server, drinks totally empty and feeling completely forgotten we asked another server to please check on our pizza. As the dining room wasn't busy we didn't understand the hold up. She explained that they had a lot of to go orders. My issue is not with the mind numbingly long wait (this happens and the servers have no control over the kitchen), my issue is with the server who, not once, came by and acknowledge our wait, offer to get us more drinks or even bother to pass by our table. We were totally ignored for the better part of an hour. I waited tables for over 6 years and I would never have allowed my customers to be neglected for that long. Just a simple \"I know you've been waiting awhile, the kitchen is a bit backed up, can I grab you some more drinks while you wait\" would have gone a long way. Skip this place. The food is definitely not worth the bad service and ridiculous wait."}
{"text":"I gave this 4 stars because it was the first time I was here.  I only had the Chopped salad but it was a good portion for the price. It was a good salad.  One of the people I was with had the pepperoni Stromboli and it looked amazing.  Service was good and had a nice lunch crowd. I would try it again."}
{"text":"I prefer to dine in at this location. The food is better fresh rather than take out. I love that they have gluten free crust. There's tv's all around so it's a nice place to watch sports. I decided to order take out here recently and although it was super easy to order online, the food wasn't as good."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I went for dinner the other night,  Just a bunch of people going to eat, talk and have a good time.  We sat at the bar. Bartender was very inefficient and not very caring. After we ordered food, it took forever,  had to ask for my salad.  \"Oh, you want that now\".  Yes I do. When 4 of our food finally came out it, was not hot, barley warm,  the meat sauce was scorched to the point of almost burned tasting.  The bread was cold.  The other 3 meals came out about 10 minutes later. Had to ask for beer refills. My wife asked a male server for a box for take home, he said we had to ask the bartender, it wasn't his job. This used to be a nice place to go and have a little fun, but give me a reason to go back."}
{"text":"I found my new favorite pizza. I ordered the double dough. Not too thick and the crust is perfectly cooked. Great sauce, cheese and toppings. I ordered through Postmates so I didn't run into any ordering issues as others have mentioned."}
{"text":"Bill and Amanda were very friendly and welcoming. They have put 1 million bucks into this amazing place. Pizza is great, so is the Pinot Grigio. Located South of Camelback and Miller in Old Town."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Arizona! The pizza is so good and the people who work here are the best. I will absolutely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"I hate to give this kind of review but this is merely for their terrible time management for delivery. This is the 3rd time I have ordered delivery and have been told a time frame and it not be delivered well over twice that amount of time. Tonight I was told 45 minutes and an hour and a half later my pizza still was not here. I can't complain about the pizza because it is always on point but seriously I would have rather paid for an uber than wait an extra hour plus. Thanks for the consistency but when delivery is the only option I will have to go with some other place."}
{"text":"This place had a location down the street from my house for years and I never tried it (McDowell & Hayden). I get coupons from time to time, and even though they're a bit further away now I decided to give Rosati's a try.   I ordered takeout, and here's the thing. I'm a petty easy-going person, but I get the complaints about the customer service here (from glancing through other reviews). No exaggeration, it took me about 15 minutes to place (what I thought ) was a pretty simple order over the phone. I had a \"family value\" coupon for a 18 inch one topping thin crust pizza (I got half cheese half sausage), 18 boneless wings (I got them plain) & a 2-liter soda (root beer). I got disconnected once, and I think they're was some confusion on how to process the coupon, but in the end it all worked out.  When I went to pick it up I thought the restaurant was very nice & a pretty big space. I'd like to go back and dine in (they have daily drink specials as well that looked good). My food was ready when I went to pick it up. The two guys who had placed my order over the phone were once again apologetic about the confusion taking the order and even ran out to my car when they realized they had forgot to give me the soda (which I had totally forgot about).  When I got home everything was delicious! I like thin-crust Chicago pizza and everything about the pizza from Rosati's was to my liking. Right amount of cheese to sauce ratio, good sausage, not too greasy, tasty crust. The wings were mostly for my nephew, who likes them plain (I would have gotten sauce), but I did taste one and they were good. They also give you a lot of ranch. Oh, I forgot...we also got a dessert. Off the top of my head I forget what it was called, but it was basically fried pieces of dough that came with nutella dipping sauce. It was yummy & a HUGE portion!  I would definitely order from here again (despite the confusion), and I'd like to dine in sometime to try some of the other food (along with the drink specials)."}
{"text":"Rosati's is amazing! I highly recommend this place. It's has a nice friendly atmosphere. The staff is incredibly friendly and they go above and beyond for their customers, even on a busy night. It's a great place to come watch the game, no matter what sport. The food is above average, they are heavy handed with toppings for your pizza, and if you get the pasta it is cheesy! The wings are massive and a great price. You will not be disappointed. You can't go wrong with any order here, just remember the portions are large so come hungry!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, boneless wings and an amazing Harvest Salad. Great sports bar! TV'S everywhere you look. Great interior and atmosphere - beats Zipps! (Side note, it is Chicago oriented theme)They would get 5, but either the Chicken Parm or the sauce is too bland."}
{"text":"I have been going to McClintock and Warner for decades, but this one is much closer.  The pizza was okay, but under cooked for my taste.  The cheese was still bright white when we got the pizza home.  Your wings absolutely suck.  At a cost of $12/dozen, this is terrible.  We ordered hot wings, they were mild at best.  They are large and meaty, but I had to put them in the oven for 20 minutes to finish them.  No one likes a hot wing that goes down like phlegm.  If you don't grasp the concept of hot wings, better off not selling them."}
{"text":"Had a great time! The food was great. But what stood out was Kristy (our server) she was on point with everything we waited for nothing, and was friendly and funny."}
{"text":"Let's make this short and sweet.... This establishment will NOT make is if you can't get customers in. This place is dead as can be. Wanted a beer but the waitress didn't know if they offered that brand. She looked on the list then told me no. Let's wait and see how the pizzas is. Location is not a good one."}
{"text":"1st time here....great atmosphere....good food....plenty of it.....good service....friendly staff with a warm welcome from Robert & Denise....big bar....lots of beer choices....many TVs....will definitely be back and looking forward to making this a neighborhood pub."}
{"text":"Love this place and been here since day one. Had a horrible experience today with the owners wife. She is not accepting club rewards on so called events. Even when the reward doesn't state excluding events. She has a very bad reputation with customers and employees. It needs to change soon."}
{"text":"If no stars was an option that's what I would have left. I placed an order online for delivery and waited an hour and half before calling, when I did call they said they called the number to confirm the order and woman said her husband would be coming to pick it up... I never got a call. And I don't have a husband.  They offered to deliver the stale items or remake it and have it brought in an hour...  the last I ordered from them I had ordered a bunch of sides and two pizzas. The only things I got were the sides, they forgot the friggen pizzas and I had to drive to get them... the pizza wasn't even worth it. Id rather eat a frozen Tony's pizza"}
{"text":"Finally a pub close to home. And finally something in the empty building. Both bartenders that were were working were super friendly, I feel like I could call them my friends from here on out. I recall the females name (Amber) but not the young man even though he extended his hand and introduced himself right away. I love the space and set up inside, plenty of TV's. Lots of beer on tap. I had an italian beef sandwich with cheese on top called The Cheef, I came about ordering that because of mentions on yelp. it was decent. I dont think its my type of sandwich, but the au jus was very good with it. I also had bruchetta which was completely amazing. Ill try the wings next time. And pizza"}
{"text":"We have been going to Rosati's since they opened a little over 2 years ago.  Management has undergone changes , but typically for the best, and we became regulars. Recently, however, I'm sorry to say that Rosati's doesn't seem like the good neighborhood pizza place we loved.  We ordered a pizza a couple of weeks ago from home and they messed it up. We asked to have our order corrected, they said it'd take an hour because they were super busy, we settled for a free pizza another night as we already had plans other than sit around waiting for pizza. Tonight we tried to claim it, but they said they don't give out free pizzas and that we were calling the wrong location because there was no record whatsoever that we ordered anything. We spoke with the manager we told them we were regulars, and sadly, he ended the call awkwardly inferring we're not telling the truth because their system is infallible and their staff highly trained.  Tim, your lack of regard and common sense is outrageous, as you were unaware that how you handled this was wrong, disrespectful and altogether damaging for the brand. The undeniable truth is this: we're simply never returning again."}
{"text":"Have ordered from this location twice now, both times our side dipping sauces were forgotten. Had to call back and wait ANOTHER HOUR for a whole new order to be sent out. This time around, our pizza showed up looking like the driver finished first in the nascar 500. Very disappointed, would not recommend ordering from this location."}
{"text":"We stopped by to discover this new sports bar-style location opened in the last few days. The pizza was great (Brak had sausage and I stuck with cheese).   They are staffed up and don't seem to be held back with opening issues. Don't forget to ask for pie cut."}
{"text":"Not all Rosati's are created equal. Terrible service, expensive and the sorriest excuse for Chicago Style Pizza I've ever had. It's not only the execution but the shitty ingredients they use. One star because I can't give zero but no way in hell I'd ever return.  Fuck this place"}
{"text":"Very  friendly help. I ordered the pasta with marinara sauce, garlic & meat balls. Huge disappointment, pasta was  mosh, used pizza sauce not  marinara, and garlic bread was a joke. Side salad consisted of not so fresh produce. Bottom line; kitchen staff is there to collect a pay check. Excellent front of house  especially Karen . Bill A Pa."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a beer and some apps Saturday around 2pm. We got a table and they weren't very busy. Waitress was great but we only ordered boneless buffalo wings and an order of fries w our beers. Seemed like it took forever. I don't understand as they weren't crowded at all. We've been here 5-6 times and the kitchen has always been slow. On a busy packed night, expect to wait. Otherwise, the beer selection and the food is good."}
{"text":"Ok where can I start. I've been craving this place for months and finally decided to order some. So I called and placed the order. Told the lady exactly what I needed and that I had a free delivery coupon,cool everything was smooth.45 mins later the delivery guy arrives pizza and wing time excited. Me and my family sit down and open everything to start serving and we realize that we got the bone-in wings and I had told them no bone. I was like ok let me call them back at this time we haven't even started eating dinner. So I called and talk to the manager and he was very cool on the phone I also told him that I got charged for my delivery. he told I will get those right back to you ASAP and you could keep the bone-in wings as our mess up no extra charge I was like AWSOME..so we opened what we had and I could say that the pizza was not what I expected not to warm a little on cold side by this time I was getting a little upset.But didn't want to call back so we just started eating what we had while the boneless wings get here. About 20-25 later the boneless wings get here my wife opens up the box and...the boneless wings where very over cooked burned(see the pic I put up here) So I could say I will never order from this place again very disappointed didn't bother to call the restaurant again. Thanks by the way never got my money back for the free delivery coupon I had."}
{"text":"$32 ($37 with tip) to have a 14\" 3-topping thin crust pizza delivered.  That's about $10 too much for a thin crust for the quality of food at this place. Regardless, I ordered a deep dish 14\" 3-topping which is why I was somewhat flexible on the quoted price. A thin crust arrived, and after the same run around for 10 minutes trying to find my order and putting me on hold that others have expressed in their reviews, they gave me a $2 credit for the price difference.   They just assumed I would be okay with paying $30 for their thin crust.  They should've offered to remake my pizza AND give me my $2 credit. Or at least wow me with more consideration than $2.    When this place is going out of business, think of schmucks like me that you burn on their only dining experience with this location."}
{"text":"As promised,  we tried pizza delivery a second time.   Much better quality and the delivery was on-time."}
{"text":"We had an absolutely wonderful experience here! This was the first time eating here and I have to say the food was delicious and the service we received from Shea was great! They had a gentleman playing some beautiful music as well. Everything was fantastic all around. I would recommend 100%!"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere! Definitely a Chicago bar!!!! Can't wait for football season!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery while in town on vacation for myself and friend with a newborn, I am from out of town and was VERY disappointed in the pizza.  40-50 minute delivery took an hour and a half and the pizza wasn't even \"hot\" it was warm.  Seriously left me wanting something more, it had no flavor. 3 miles from the house....won't order again."}
{"text":"went here from out of town to watch the Cavs game! Seated us right next to a large TV and we were good to go. Servers were friendly. Food and drinks are very reasonably priced. The dough bites were too delicious! Good for happy hour as well."}
{"text":"Not quite sure why my sister chose to eat at a Chicago styled restaurant considering I'm from Chicago while we were in Arizona, but I can almost always go for some Chicago pizza and Chicago sports memorabilia. Definitely felt like a piece of home which was nice. Our waitress was very friendly and the food was good. Nothing spectacular, but still tasty."}
{"text":"Terrible service and the food wasn't great either. Nicole E. was our server and she was so unfriendly and didn't tell us about happy hour or specials. The wings were boring and flavorless and the beef sandwich was worse. The pricing is high for mediocre food. It took forever to get our food and the service over all was super slow. I did enjoy watching the staff stand around and socialize in the back while we waited forever. That was the cherry on top. We won't be going back. There's so many sports bars in Old Town, I suggest you find another place."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for the penne pasta and the delivery driver called 5 min later and said he had a family emergency and couldn't deliver any more which I can understand but then I called the store and the bartender who had taken our order didn't offer any other option to make sure we got our food or even tried to accomodate us even with a coupon she was pretty much like your shit out luck maybe it's cuz I called 40 min before closing but the customer service was horrible il never be ordering from them again considering I didn't even get to try their food. What a joke!"}
{"text":"I've been anxiously waiting for Rosati's to open in this location as I live a block away.  Went for the first time today, and it was impressive.  Food was great, service even better, beer selection has something for everyone.  But what got me was the space...the expansive space allowing for a sports atmosphere that isn't cramped.  Lot's of natural light inside, so you don't feel like you're crawling out of a cave after a mid afternoon game.  Not to mention that there's plenty of outside seating to enjoy this beautiful Arizona weather.  I will be back...very often."}
{"text":"I've always had a great experience at Rosati's mostly delivery and occasionally pick up. Delivery usually takes an hour so time accordingly or pick it up it's usually 20 minutes. Food is great. Service has always been friendly."}
{"text":"OK so I got a menu in the mail for this place. Today I placed my first phone order and it took a hour plus for delivery .  Ordered the Meat Mania pizza and this pizza  was overloaded with the meats. I will order again."}
{"text":"First time I visited oven doesn't work so no pizza. Second time get the wrong pizza, wait 25 min for my beverage, and this is with only two other groups in there. Also if you're thinking this is a Chicago type sports bar it is not. Bad service overall, too bad I really wanted to like this place.  Ordered deliver yesterday. Pizza was dripping out of the box. When I opened it I saw that the sauce had slide to one side which created a soggy wet half and left me cheese bread on the other half. Also super salty. I want to like this place but three for three in bad experiences means I'm giving up on them."}
{"text":"Literally the worst service. I had to get my drinks at the bar because no one would even come to my table. I wanted to order dinner, but didn't get to because I literally got NO service."}
{"text":"1st time checking this place out.. I must say it is bomb!! The pizza was stacked with toppings, literally like 2inch high of just straight up toppings!! The wings were huge and flavorful!! Staff here are very attentive and charismatic. They have lots of tables and tv's; which is a plus!! I would absolutely recommend this location."}
{"text":"We have ordered from this very location numerous times and never had a problem, until tonight. We placed our first order at 5:30 tonight and didn't receive it until 7:00 and it was ice cold. We called for a replacement and the gentleman who spoke to us assured us that our  replacement would be sent to us right out of the oven and would be to us within 30-45 minutes. An hour later still no replacement so my wife called, again, to now check on the replacement. She got a very snotty young lady who, basically, brushed off our anger and frustration and told us that she'd reach out to the driver. We never heard from the driver. After it had been a full hour (and by this time we'd been waiting for a hot pizza for a total of three hours) my wife called and asked to speak to the manager. The manager, also, brushed us of with a \"Well it's a regular busy night, sorry, I'll reach out to the driver and see where he is.\" And that's all he said. It's now been 10 minutes since THAT phone call and STILL no pizza OR call from the driver.  I understand busy Friday nights, I do. However, it shouldn't take THREE HOURS to get A HOT pizza. Oh, look at that, it FINALLY arrived after 3 hours.  HORRIBLE customer service, go to another location or pick a different restaurant!!!!!"}
{"text":"I do not even know what to say .. 1 hour and 20 minutes this took to get to my place and it shows up like this. 14\" cheese pizza that cost $22 . this is by far the worst service and pizza i have ever received in my 23 years of existence .. this was so unbelievable. i called back and all they said was oh no let me run another one out to you . that's 2 hours for this. i will never order from them again , i have never been served with something like this .. not to mention this is the second time this has happened. Pizza hut isn't even this terrible."}
{"text":"Fantastic old town Scottsdale Chicago bar. Great Midwest service, awesome bar tenders that cater to your needs, and the pizza is like back home. If you are a true Chicago sports fan this is your place. Great vibe,  Chicago atmosphere, and memorabilia."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, and our server Debbie was amazing...I hope that the owner or manager will read this and recognize her with the credit she deserves.  This was our first time in, and we will be back"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times before writing this review. Staff is very friendly but takes for ever to get served your food. Pasta over sauced, over cooked and bread was burned. Fried poppers and wings over breaded with no taste. Subpar pizza not planning on heading back as there are too many great pizza places in the area."}
{"text":"Where to begin... let's start with the order. I ordered off the yelp app. It charged my card and said it would be here in an hour. That hour passed so I called them and they immediately placed me on hold for 20 minutes. Which out checking in mind you. They clearly forgot about me. I hung up and called back in to them having time to take my order. I explained I was on hold for 20 minutes and there was no apology. Just \"what's your name\" and back on hold I went. They came back to tell me they don't have my order. I have them the order number and they have no record. She was clearly trying to get me off the phone and I told her my card was charged I'd like my order. She sighed and asked me what it was and they could make it for me. I told her large penne with garlic bread. Back on hold I went. She came back and magically found my order and said it would be delivered in 20 minutes. Never have I see complete lack of ownership from an establishment. She refused to acknowledge I was on the phone on hold for 20 minutes. Without arguing I wouldn't have my order. I'm currently waiting for my food now. Hoping that all this hassle was worth it. I will follow up.   12/14/16 - Follow Up I was promised a credit would be added to my account. It was not. I had to speak to the owner to be taken care of properly. In the end they did make amends and comp my order and I reordered some more food on the spot. Overall it was a terrible first experience but they made it right.  I'm hoping this next order makes up for it."}
{"text":"My first experience at Rosati's wasn't the best. I'd compare it to being cat-fished on Tinder; all hopes were swept away on first sight like the dirt piling up under the rug. To start, I had to deal with the salty bears fans lingering around after their devastating lost in week 1; come on what did you expect, You haven't had a great season since 85 and I wouldn't expect another one any time soon.   To start,I was denied the sweet, sweet nectar of a tasty citradelic and having to settle for something less. I like Union Jack, but it doesn't take my taste buds on the same glorious adventure as citrusy taste of liquid gold chilling every nerve in my mouth . As for the food, it tasted alright once I got to enjoy after everyone else at the table. I felt like the red headed step child getting scraps tossed to him at a separate table from the rest of the family.   Overall, I'd like to give this place a rating of 3.015. The best way to some up my experience is like watching the Lions; you go in with high hopes only to be disappointed in the end."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  Paid 60 for fight.  We were told we'd be on patio.  That was fine.  However we were in a flood zone.  Our table was covered with water the umbrella moved and a blanket of ware fell on us.  There was a 2\"puddle  of water under table.  Our napkins and plates filled with water. Asked manager for some type of credit. He said ummm.  Ummm ummm it us out of my hands.  What are managers for.  I'm highly disappointed.  Have been here multiple times. First time I can't believe the service of managers.  Waitress was the only highlight.  She was appalled at the disorganization as well.    They even put up wet floor a frames signs due to the misters soaking everything."}
{"text":"I stopped in last night wanted to try something new with a friend and my grandson...First the service was great we were seated with menu ...drinks came right away ...we ordered meal with salad.. the salad was fresh and great ...pizza hot out the oven ...my sandwich was mouth watering good and the lasagne was just like my mom use to make ...I will go back this is a great find ...And coming soon Live Music so what more could you ask for ...Bluesman Mike"}
{"text":"Ordered food online got there to pick it up and they inform me they don't have the order and have been having problems with their ticket system. How are you going to accept orders online and not know how to track them if something goes wrong. I called for a refund since the app charged the order to my card and couldn't hear them talking because of the music in the background. I had to go back in for the refund. Not a good look for this place. Won't go again"}
{"text":"We have been waiting an hour and 20 minutes and counting for our delivery.  This pizza and pasta better be perfect when we get it because this wait is painful.  We are starving.  Update - we finally got the food after an hour and 35 minutes.  It was lukewarm, not accurate, and tasted ok.  We were starving at 1015 at night and I would have eaten the cardboard at that point.  This was probably the most disappointing pizza delivery experience I have had.  I would not recommend this place unless you are meeting a friend who specifically decided to go there.  It was that bad."}
{"text":"Just waited over 2 hours for delivery of one small pizza.  Pizza is solid but certainly not worth the wait time."}
{"text":"This place is great, Heidi and Charity made my night!  Great atmosphere, great food and great service. What more can you ask for!"}
{"text":"Just had a horrible experience turned around by the person in charge at this location. We tried calling in for a pick up order with only an endless ringing on the other end, so we ordered online, that worked fine. We were told 20-25 minutes, we get there about 5 minutes early and were told about 7 minutes, well 15 minutes after that we were served our pizza. Upon getting home we find our pizza is black as night burnt. We go back and were helped right away by Jeannie, thank you so much to her and her professionalism. We were extremely dissatisfied at first, but Jeannine's professionalism and handling of us was perfect.   The remake pizza we had was delicious!"}
{"text":"Ive never had a bad meal here. Its the service that I cannot take. I pop in this neighborhood bar on occasion and if you sit at the bar, you get great service. But every. Single. Time we have 6 or more, we sit at a table and undoubtedly get Morgan and have horrible service. Its mind boggling because they're never THAT busy. I mean, we were in last night and literally asked for water about 4 times. Really, really slow and the bartender was coming out from behind the bar to help her. Somebody ran her food. Its seriously ludicrous how awful it is. But, its a nice, clean neighborhood spot with great food."}
{"text":"An overall awful experience.   I had a free Postmates delivery code to use, and I was hungry at work, so I decided to order food from Rosati's. I remember trying my coworker's tomato spinach garlic bread from Rosati's once -- the spinach and tomato were perfectly cooked, and it was a delicious little appetizer. So I decided to order that.  The item was missing from Rosati's Postmates menu, so I called up Rosati's and asked if I could still request it. The man who answered said he had no idea they were even affiliated with Postmates and couldn't help me. This was a little irritating, but I took matters into my own hands. I added \"cheesy garlic bread\" to my order, and in the requests, I wrote \"spinach and tomato garlic bread, as described on your menu.\"   When I received my order, I opened it up to find cheesy garlic bread topped with cold tomato slices and cold spinach -- absolutely not what I ordered, and not what they typically serve. I can't tell if they upcharged me for the tomato/spinach because Postmates takes a couple days to charge your card, but if they did, I'll be pretty annoyed.   An added note: The cheesy garlic bread on Postmates is more than $1 more than the spinach tomato cheesy garlic bread on Rosati's actual menu. The man I spoke with on the phone blamed it on Postmates. No other restaurant has this issue, so I seriously doubt it."}
{"text":"It's ok.   We came here it the hopes of watching an NHL playoff game.  We know from previous experience that it is too cold to sit indoors, so we asked for the patio.  Then we asked for the misters to be shut off.  After sunset, there is really no need. The TV would not play sound. The speaker are all connected and they were playing sound for the NBA game.   Staff was really nice.   My antipasto salad is always good, but this time it was exceptional The lasagna was good as well.   Small but adequate wine list. At 9:00 the DJ starts his assault.   Most diners had left at that point, so they finally turned the sound on for our hockey game.   Our server cashed out, but we were still attended to. Washroom is clean.  That A/C is just way too much. Will try the pizza next time if we can get a seat on the patio."}
{"text":"Great place the staff is awesome and the owners too. The food was just as good as the service. The sweet and spicy wings were some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I went here a few times during Cubs baseball playoffs. The layout is primarily center and a large bar in the middle. I usually just drank a beer or two and had an occasional appetizer.  However, this building seems to have a problem keeping a restaurant. I live in the area and noticed the sign out front now reads \"Sweet Home Chicago\" New owners / same interior? Old Owners deciding to no longer pay Rosati's franchise fees? I will let you know next time I stop in to this location."}
