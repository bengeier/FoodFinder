{"text":"Been waiting for this place to open. As far as I know, thos is the only good taco shop in vegas outside of North Vegas. Their salsas were both very good, as well as the agua fresca. I got a carne asada, adobada, and buche taco and all three were good. I also got a vampiro which was also really good. Their salsa bar had some good pickled carrots with some free cucumbers and lines. Once the weather isn't so hot, I look foreward to trying their birria de chivo, which is really hard to find on this side of vegas."}
{"text":"The customer service is great!!! They're very friendly, the service is quick, and the food is fresh. Most authentic Mexican food in Henderson, with an incredible taste. I highly recommend the carni a sad a burrito!!!"}
{"text":"So tonight was my third time there cashier named Anna was very personable and professional they do have a limited menu however no enchiladas or chili rellenos but their carne asada is the best I've ever had and I am a Mexican food fanatic from La LOL the only downside is there tacos are small so be aware that is being authentic they don't cost much so it's okay I love now that I know the menu I can go through drive thru it's so eccentric Mexican that they have goat"}
{"text":"I hate to be another bad review on a new restaurant, but truly I am not quite sure who is giving the five stars. We did a family dinner order that contained fish tacos, carne asada tacos, chicken burrito, and a quesadilla. Out of all of the options the fish tacos were surprisingly the best. The carne asada and chicken both tasted like something you would get out of a freezer. The onions and cilantro both seemed old and flavorless. Do yourself a favor and stick with Taco Y Taco, or even Robertos in a pinch."}
{"text":"$9.00 for 3 little tacos wrapped in aluminum foil and a $1.00 size drink anywhere else. Have to say the asada and the carnitas were good, but NOT that good. Picture on the drive through looks like you are getting a nice plate of tacos. The look on my face when they handed me this tiny little bag must have been priceless. Won't drive down there anytime soon to eat there again."}
{"text":"Good, authentic Mexican food. Restaurant was spotless, service was friendly, albeit a tad slow, but we understand they are still getting processes down because they are new.   Quesadillas and tacos and burritos were all tasty! A good addition to Henderson!"}
{"text":"Wonderful authentic street tacos and vampiros are amazing. Discovers in Yelp and is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Legit. Had the Carne Asada and Al Pastor Tacos. Solid flavors. Tacos are street taco size. The Bean and cheese burrito was also high ranking. My wife is a bean and cheese sommelier and I got a high five for bringing one home."}
{"text":"YES YES YES!!! Eat here! would recommend to anyone! authentic mexican food for cheap prices. good and fast service!"}
{"text":"This is great Mexican fast food.  My husband had the asada burrito and it was great.  I had the chicken and asada tacos and they were the best tacos I have had in a very long time.  The staff was very friendly and the service was great.  Great place for Mexican fast food"}
{"text":"I drive by this place all the time. Finally, looking for something different, I decided to try it. I ordered the chicken quesadilla (I know, totally basic). It was huge, so I wasn't able to finish it, but it was delicious. All of the veggies in it were fresh and flavorful. I wasn't a huge fan of the salsa, but it wasn't bad. Their guacamole is awesome. All around, this was a good experience. Staff is nice, food is good, what more could you ask for? Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Finally an authentic taco spot nearby! Awesome food, friendly staff! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I tried this new place out. The food isn't bad, and I liked how flavorful the carnitas was. I just wished they gave you more meat for the price as compared to other Mexican restaurants & not fill up the burrito with too many beans. The first time there they forgot one of my tacos. They said I could come pick it up another day, which I did. It was a fish taco with a bit too many toppings that I made into a salad. It was good, though."}
{"text":"went there on on friday..july 14th,,,,no one was there..it was great..thought there would be a crowd but we got lucky,,,ordered the carne asada burrito combo...(not the plate)..as advertised it was about 7 or 8 bucks...my only gripe is the peice for extras....avacado is .95 and cheese is extra as well....they charge ya for everything...other than that the steak was awesomeeeeeeeeeeeee,,,,everything on my burrito reminded me of chicago but not too much....although it was still great...prices are confusing but otherwise it is a great place...on a side note..dont use your debit(if ya have one) card there....they actually make ya type all that info into that register..hence the minus a star"}
{"text":"Lord heard my prayers. Glad to have a place thats does great tacos the right way from los angeles. Great burritos and tacos."}
{"text":"Flavorful, great quality tacos. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is very clean. We had carne asada and al pastor tacos and they were delicious. The al pastor was flavorful with a hint of cinnamon. So much better than Robertos and Faustos! 2 combo meals and chips and guacamole for $16. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good, straightforward taqueria. Clean, and nice service. I would definitely return when in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  I ordered the chicken vampiro & my husband ordered the chicken tacos. One of the best chicken dinners we've had at a Mexican restaurant. A couple things that would make the experience better would be better utensils and as silly as it may sound, a better presentation of their fresh made chips, maybe serve them in a bowl or paper lined chip basket rather than on a paper plate. Other than that, the restaurant was very clean but casual. This will become our go-to for casual Mexican food."}
{"text":"Every visit I've been greeted with a very friendly staff A frequent visit punch card is given The fish tacos are pretty killercarne asada even better close and convenient, thank you!!"}
{"text":"Great tacos!  Best fish taco I have had in Vegas. Cantaloupe aqua frescas is like drinking a cantaloupe. Yummy.  Super friendly service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"First time here! Service was awesome! The guy at the register, I assume who is the manager, let us sample the al pastor, carnitas, & chicken first before ordering. All very good, but I ended up ordering al pastor & pescado tacos. He also let us sample their fresh made daily guacamole & chips. So good! Best tacos I've had in awhile! We also got large horchatas & got free refill! They have a salsa bar too. This is their first location they opened in Las Vegas. Their other 3 are in California. Highly recommend! Great service, delicious food, & clean place."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Nice flavor in the carne asada torta. Meat was real tender and the roll was nice and fresh.  Place is real clean and our food was cooked to order. From time of order to the table, 3 minutes tops.  We'll definitely be back to try something else. Oh and the green salsa is smoking, But very tasty."}
{"text":"The chicken tacos are great. And the guacamole is homemade and very good"}
{"text":"New taco place in the neighborhood alert!      So what appeals to me: Fresh ingredients  Cooked to order  Meats seasoned well Not doused with tons of gooey cheese Prices reasonable  Agua Fresca has fresh fruit. Try Canteloupe!  What's Cool They take orders thru Drive-thru  They're open late night Punch Cards!   The restaurant is a former Jack-Box, that had remained empty for the past 7? years.  Inside, place is clean, outside, I like that the parking lot is brightly lit at night. That's how we all found out it was open! That and also from neighbors on social media site NextDoor of all places! Shout out to Yelper who sent message to let me know too.  I'm not a big taco fan, but I did like my street tacos and LOVE the canteloupe drink. Had lunch here the other day with friends /neighbors and they loved it! And was happy they are open too.   So nice to see we have another family run place other than all those places on Stephanie St. aka fast food franchise alley. #supportlocal  And that's my contribution for Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Great Fast and tasty,   They have my favorite, corn tortilla quesadillas.  You can also get meat in your quesadillas, corn or flour.   I tried the fish tacos, super yummy with big slices of avocados.   Try the Tortas (Sandwich) I had the carne asada.   They also have several flavors of Aguas Frescas, including melon, and pineapple. I had the lemonade, nice stuff"}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! The quality is so much better than anyplace else in town . Very friendly staff and it's super clean . We will be back often ."}
{"text":"I have eaten their delicious fish tacos twice now and can't wait to eat them again!  So yummy!"}
{"text":"The tacos are very good. So much flavor in a small package. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the mood for food tacos at a good value."}
{"text":"Came to visit a family member and found this spot on yelp. Once we were there I realized I've been to one of their locations in Los Angeles. Definitely recommend this taco joint if your craving some bomb Mexican food. The workers are very friendly and the restaurant is clean.  Free refills and has a drive thru.  I had a carne asada burrito but I forgot to add pictures. The burrito only includes the meat and beans with onions, if you want additional add ons you need to ask. Like rice or guacamole etc..."}
{"text":"Sad. Smh. Money wasted ( insert tear here ) The food was so sad. I had a carne Asada taco, and a barbecue pork one...carne asada taste: meat with salt. Pork taco:? Idk lol  Salsa is very important to me ( so are showers ) It's a NEED! And this place did not provide any of my needs. Just another dead beat:D"}
{"text":"Very good asada reminded me of some of the better taco shops in LA. Tacos under 4$ burritos and tortas around 6$ went for 1st time tonight will definitely  be back."}
{"text":"I must say I enjoyed this place, so much so in fact that after eating my food I got up and placed another order.  Was that because the tacos were smaller than I was expecting or because I eat too much and wanted to try the whole menu?  Some may never know.  Either way, the food was pretty delicious.   Carne asada taco: good Carnitas taco: really good Fish taco: bigger than the other ones for some reason and great (best taco of the night) Chicken taco: a bit dry (my least favorite item of the night) Carne asada burrito: pretty good Al pastor vampiro: messy, too expensive for how little you get but also very good   Most of their items come with the basics, meat, onions, cilantro, and hot sauce.  You can get extras added but I wanted to try the basic first and I was pleasantly surprised.  The salsa bar has two different kinds of green sauce, pickled red onions, limes, carrots, and jalapenos.  I will be headed back here to try the rest of the menu or at least a lot of it, as some of the meats are for the more adventurous.  It hits all of the check list though.  Close to my house.  Relatively cheap.  Friendly staff.  Drive-thru.  Fresh and tasty food.  If you thought that all Mexican places in Henderson were the same, come here for a different take on an old friend."}
{"text":"Had some fish tacos and they were amazing. Everything was fresh and delicious. Fish cooked perfectly. Coming back to try everything in the menu."}
{"text":"We found this place here on Yelp and it did not disappoint. The customer service alone was enough to come back for. The tacos, burritos, and guacamole were great."}
{"text":"First time trying and honestly i'll probably try it again. Food was so-so. We got a burrito and 2 tacos to split. Burrito was decent but definitely could have passed on the tacos. Overall it was lacking seasoning and the salsas just added heat, not flavor. The service was amazing though. Answered our questions and even made suggestions."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Authentic Mexican street tacos, look no further. Being from L.A. I can confirm that these are it! They load the tacos up with plenty of meat. I had 3 carne asada tacos and my oh my, I went back to get 2 more. The meat was perfectly marinated, cooked with a little char and moist!! The carrots, jalapenos and radish accompanying it was also delicious. The horchata was as good as it gets. Definitely can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"These have to be the most expensive fish tacos from a taco shop I've ever bought. I got 3 fish tacos \"vampiro\" (which is basically one tortilla deep fried with a little bit of cheese on it) and a drink and the bill was $14 and change. Didn't really catch it till I got home because it was late, so I went back the next day to ask about it. I hand the girl the receipt and she re-rings it to check if it's right and says, \"No, it was actually supposed to be $15.32.\" What the what? I ask her why since the drive-thru window advertises a 3 taco combo for $3.85 and she says, \"Not for fish. Fish is more.\" Ok. That might work, but there's a charge on the receipt for making them vampire for $7.30. So my bill was 70 cents less than getting a 3 shrimp taco plate with rice, beans, soup and service at LINDO. I don't get it."}
{"text":"Open for only about 6 months and this place is making their food from scratch!  Fresh food made daily! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"We finally decided to try Rico's last weekend. I loved it so much we went back this weekend! I ordered the steak vampiro both times. So good! The chips and guacamole were also very fresh (real guac, chunky not pureed) and delicious. Friendly staff and clean restaurant. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Found a new taco place! There's a fresh selection of meats and aguas frescas. We ordered cantaloupe water with carne asada and al pastor tacos. The only problem I had was the salsa bar. It was running low on a few things and not as clean as I like to see. The tacos were great and the water was very refreshing."}
{"text":"Excellent food, real mexican food. Staff is always friendly everytime we have gone in. glad they came from Cali"}
{"text":"Muy buenos tacos, excelente sabor, a la plancha, los de arrachera con pastor (campechanos) son de lo mejor en Las Vegas del estilo, no dejen de probar los burritos, la ley son 2 por persona."}
{"text":"So out of all the choices in the Henderson valley for fast food Mexican this place is by far the best. You won't find a huge daunting menu like you do at Fausto's or the other chains.   This place is pretty much strictly tacos and burritos with some of the best tasting meat in Henderson. They have a tostada called the Vampiro. This is a house specialty that is a must try. With avocado and choice of meat for a little over 3 bucks it's a bargain.  I've been a huge fan of the carne asada burrito though. I splurge and pay the 55 cents to add cheese. They do cheddar here. It's a simple burrito. Salsa, meat, onions, cilantro and retried beans. You can go big and do extra meat for about 2 bucks more but honestly it's got the right amount.  They also have traditional drinks like jamaica and horchata. I tried them both and both are pretty much up to par with all the others.   Had to give them a 4/5 because of the wait sometimes at lunch. Sometimes it can feel like it's understaffed but it's worth the wait. Wish they were open later on weekends though."}
{"text":"Yummy! Everything is fresh, homemade. People are super friendly. A new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Fish taco was awesome. Great place. Nice salsa bar and selection of drinks. The chips tasted like they were made from scratch and have a hint of lime. Pretty good; definitely better than the other fast Mexican food places and priced very well too! Everything is cooked fresh to order, have to be a little patient."}
{"text":"Awesome food, Best service . Love it. Had the asada tacos, Yum! Definitely coming back for the salsa and beans !!!!"}
{"text":"Their flour tortillas are amazing! I had 2 fish tacos, 1 corn quesadilla and my husband had a carne asada burrito. They made a flour tortilla quesadilla by mistake so we got to try it too. Everything was delicious, this place took back to Tijuana (local tj) the minute is tasted their tortillas. The fish tacos were really good to, they are more home made style witch is awesome! Because they are not as heavy. Every one I spoke to was so friendly and excited to be working there. I am sorry to see other lower reviews that may hurt a nice business, you should review the place for the food they have, not the food you want them to have."}
{"text":"Nice to have authentic tacos close to home. Agua frescas were very good. My vampiros were delicious as were the  carne asada burrito and tacos. The meat quesadillas had a weird cheese sauce- bleh. The beans could have been better.   We will be back, but will avoid the carne asada quesadilla."}
{"text":"Placed an order showed up to pick up and the dorky tall white kid had never even put it in! Drove 15 minutes to get there, then his dumb ass says \" oh it will only take 15 min, I lost ur order!\" Wtf! This kid should be fired.. he has no business working there or any other place."}
{"text":"Hidden little gem with REAL mexican food. Check it out.................................................................................................."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! We tried this place last week and can't wait to go back. You can't beat a good taco for $1.75!"}
{"text":"I use to go to Roberto's taco shop for my quick Mexican food, but now my favorite place is Rico's El tio.. the guy that runs it knows everything about his food.. he prepares it daily early early in the morning along with the nice fresh juices. They have many many many different meats you can choose from. They have a really good home made goat soup. They let you try a sample of anything you want before ordering it. Overall i guarantee you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Goat soup does not have bones and is delicious. Their Vampiros are priced right and great (they remind me of a tostada). I wouldn't say it's super fast (which is okay) so if you go through the drive through, keep that in mind.  Quesadillas are 12\" and stuffed!  Burritos are great. They have a fish taco, and they will make goat tacos if they have goat left.  This is a big step up and more authentic than Roberto's or Fausto's.  No dessert items yet, but they are planning to have some in the future."}
{"text":"Outstanding street tacos.  Freshly prepared meats and tons of condiments.  Don't even get me going on the great prices.  All tacos $1.75!  First location in Henderson and 3 in California.  The owner was wonderful and even gave me taste of the carnitas before I decided.   This will become a family favorite!"}
{"text":"Lol sorry I was hoping this would be a legit good taco place but it was horrible. I ordered a steak burrito and it was steakums in a wrap. I got that feeling in my stomach like the feeling you get after eating Mcdonalds."}
{"text":"Oh no, not again!  My last order of tacos wasn't very good. The carne asada taco wasn't as flavorful as before and I took a bite that was all fatty.  Then 2 fish tacos and one of the fish is so salty I couldn't eat it, the other one was ok, but AGAIN not like it was. Seems the fish tacos are the most inconsistent item on their menu, got to keep it the same or you'll lose customers. I had flakey fresh fish my first visit when it was grand opening time, and this time it's was some kind of salty dry piece. Maybe just stay with the chicken because the other meats are just not the same. Please go back to the original standards, it was so good!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food! Fresh and tasty tacos! They have something called Vampiro, and it is amazing! It's like a crunchy tortilla filled with yummy stuff on top! I am told you can't get it anywhere else! Fresh juices are so good! Kids love it too! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I'd have to say this is one of my favorite Mexican places out here, it's a bit different then taco y taco so I don't want to compare them. I got 3 tacos (chicken, carne, chicken) and 1 bean and cheese burrito and spent $8. They fresh make the food and they have a drive thru. Also they have excellent customer service and are always so nice!   Pros: drive thru, fresh Mexican food, EXCELLENT customer service   Cons: I really can't think of anything to be honest."}
{"text":"First time ..very clean place, the cashier was friendly and polite. I ordered carne asada tacos legit street tacos and very flavorful. I was thrill to see they have beef tongue and beef head. Please don't take those off, ever!!!!! Also i saw they have goat stew??!!! I am going to try that next time for sure! I give four star for two reason we had some sliced cucumber and it wasn't fresh at all that my kids had to throw it away and the salsa in the taco was too spicy which I didn't know (maybe I should ask next) but other than that everything was good!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service!! The young man working the register was such a hard worker."}
{"text":"Wow this is a great place to get awesome tacos and birria de chivo.. So glad there on horizon ridge"}
{"text":"Amazing.   My first time experiencing Ricos Tacos was tonight.   I have never picked up takeout, drove home, ate the food and was compelled to go and buy more.  I did tonight.  First order: 1 - Carne asada taco 1 - Carnitas taco 1- Carnitas vampiros  Second order: 2 Carnitas vampiros  After devouring the first order I could not stop thinking about the vampiros.  I had to go back.    I have not found better mexican in Henderson"}
{"text":"Del Taco colors., Spanish TV and Music playing. Very fast food like decorum. I ordered a chicken Burrito and Horchado. Food was pretty good. The Horchado was what should be expected. The Burrito with everything was delicious with a bit of Picante to light up the taste buds.A smidge under 10.00 for the meal. I would say a bit expensive for what was dealt but the quality of the food made it worth it"}
{"text":"Our soccer team came here to have lunch and rest between games. We are from out of town so we did a search on Yelp. Glad we found this place. The food here is great!!!  Kids can be picky, but they gobbled up food quickly and enjoyed the agua frescas.  Gotta try their Birria de Chivo. It was prepared well and they give you a lot. Very tasty...  Good service, lots of parking, drive thru, and plenty of seating. I had a few good pics, but my wife accidentally deleted my original review before I could submit so I had to start again."}
{"text":"This place is off the charts!!! Love their tacos , bomb af. Service is excellent !!! 5 stars"}
{"text":"Oh my worrrrrrrd! Please do yourself a favor and try this place. Best carne asada tacos I've had in a very long time. Authentic menu selections and refreshing \"aguas\".  Delucious, clean environment and friendly staff. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. The manager go out of their way to make sure your experience is a good one.. good food.. you'll want to cone back"}
{"text":"Everyone on our Nextdoor app was raving about this place.  I am a vegetarian and they didn't have large variety of options for me.  The cheese quesadilla was really good though. I would have liked to see more selection of salsas (there was only 1 type). They did seem to have a lot of authentic Mexican meat dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Just moved from California to Henderson and mission #1 was finding our favorite Mexican food restaurant. This has quickly become our favorite place out here! Friendly staff and the carne asada tacos and burritos are GREAT!! They totally have the legit street taco style nailed! Carne asada and chicken is marinated nicely too. So happy they have a location in Henderson!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible! Not much on the menu to choose from, the women working the counter does not speak any English! Spent $29 and was not impressed at all! We will not be returning to this establishment!"}
{"text":"Excellent little location in Henderson. Nice authentic Mexican food with out the fuss.  The manager is always going out of his way to ensure the customer is happy and satisfied. There are not many feast food stilled places where the management is that concerned. Give Ricos Tacos El Tio a visit , by the way, the tortas are amazing!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food all the way around, And the chips and beans are EXCELLENT as I read! Fresh as always and great burritos too."}
{"text":"We checked out this place and were not disappointed. The service was excellent. The homemade drink... Lemonade, cantaloupe, and horchada were so yummy!  The food was delicious... I can't believe the quality and quantity of food for the price! We will return."}
{"text":"Really authentic Tacos in Henderson. Excellent Pico de Gallo, probably one of the best I have ever had. They offered us free chips on our first visit. I will definitely be back and tell everyone one I know that Rico's has the best tacos in Henderson."}
{"text":"Interesting take on Mexican food. Menu is different from traditional places. No rice and beans. Good food thou!"}
{"text":"A solid option for a quick, inexpensive Mexican meal. The concept is similar to a Roberto's, just order at the counter and grab your food when it's ready.   The employees that were working when we visited were very friendly. They explained the menu and were generally very welcoming. The restaurant was clean and had a nice amount of seating. Our food was prepared quickly.  I ordered two tacos, carnitas and chicken. Both were good and fairly full for street style tacos. The chips and guacamole were good. The guacamole was the way that I like it, a bit chunky with nice sized pieces of the ingredients. My husband had a quesadilla that he really enjoyed and it was a large portion."}
{"text":"Second time trying this place,  had a carne asada taco, and al pastor tacos. The carne asada was bland,  no flavor,  the al pastor I would order again.  The carrots have to heat to them,  but the red salsa has a nice spice to it.  I gave 2 stars because this time i used the drive thru,  and once at the window asked why the difference in price,  to which I was informed they had raised all their prices,  but have not updated the menu.... ummm really poor business practice,  will not be back."}
{"text":"I premise this by saying I'm from San Diego, and grew up on having Mexican food weekly, I've even had it in Mexico plenty of times; and this place just doesn't do it for me.   We live close by and saw the place and decided to try it out. We only ordered (2) Carne Asada burritos to see how the food was. My boyfriend said his wasn't too bad, but I wasn't a fan. My burrito was really wet and it had refried beans in with the carne asade (as well as the pico de gallo, etc). It also lacked any real seasoning, and the salsas we put on our burritos just had heat to them, without any flavor.   The menu is limited to tacos, burritos, tortas, and nachos for the most part. Since I love mexican food and we live close by, we will prob try it again -- definitely be trying something different and hopefully it will be worth my while. Beware of the rave reviews from other people, if they've never had great, real mexican food, well... ignorance is bliss."}
{"text":"Very clean place to eat, fresh food. Love the birria! Excellent customer service. Quick service and enough room to eat in. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It just opened and their service is very attentive and nice.  My friend and I walked in during an off time and the counter person was very accommodating and helpful.  Their meats don't look the greatest however they do taste pretty good.  I did like the al pastor and their chicken and I chose to make them into tacos.  This spot took over a Jack in the Box right off Stephanie and Horizon Ridge.  It's good for a quick bite to eat and will satisfy your taco cravings.  Next time I'll either get a burrito or a torta...or maybe just stick with the tacos.  Dang, I love Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food not the Tex-Mex crap.  I have been there several time and it has been awesome!!! You must go, I'm going again."}
{"text":"AMAZING customer service and the food and drinks are very good. The horchata is delicious and the Frescas are fresh. Carne asada tacos are really good and so is the quesadilla."}
{"text":"Can we talk about this place? Awesome service, HUGE food portions and good prices. The Carne Asada fries are great and the tacos are the best in town. Great customer service and it has a drive through. Tip though! It's made to order so you'll have a wait at the drive through and they have a rewards punch card."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after having it bookmarked for a while and in need of decent Mexican food. It is definitely worth giving it a try. It has a drive through, so instead of usually going inside for the first time I used the drive through instead. Big, bright and easy to read menu made it easy for my order of Asada burrito and a Pollo ( chicken ) burrito. Asked for no onions, sour cream, green and red salsa on the side. The lady that took my order was very friendly and patient. Explained what was in the burrito-my choice of meat, red salsa, cilantro, guacamole, and cheese. They even have Birria de Chivo ( a traditional goat stew ) availble! Will come back to try the Birria next time for sure. Food was ready in a short while which leads me to believe they actually cook it up to order. Not too long though and not too fast. Both burritos are of good size and were hot and tasty. Forgot the sour cream on the side, but both the green and red salsas were in the bag. I would say this place is above average, but the customer service, variety of quick and fairly inexpensive Mexican food makes it stand out. I would come back try out their other menu items."}
{"text":"Wife found out about it and reluctantly I thought \"Not another mediocre fast food joint. But I was wrong. The first thing that hit me was how clean and organized the place was. I tried the lengua burrito, quesadilla, and fish tacos to hedge my bet hoping that at least if it sucked I would get at least one good thing outa 3. Wrong again,,,, best tasting fish taco, quesadilla, and fish tacos I ever had!!!! Most all I have tasted in the past is same Mexican food compensated for by another spice added. Granted this is a type of place that concentrates on moist and tender as it is all made from start and to order and not bulked and assembly line food. You may not like that they have only the tostada as the only crispy thing on the menu but you really need to try it to understand the awesome flavor. Most places just deep fry a couple Gortons fish sticks in a corn tortilla with cabbage and some tartar sauce and call it a day,,,I hate fish tacos!!!! but I love these fish tacos. They have other stores in CA and this is their first here and I hope you find it as good and tasty as I did and support their expansion here for this excellent place that beats the crap out of all the others in the Vegas area,,,,Just sayin'"}
{"text":"Great service!!! Everyone was nice it made it feel like back home in LA. The food is so good, authentic Mexican food. We will definitely be going back. We tried the torta of asada, burrito of asada and chicken tacos very delicious."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch as we were heading out of town back home from our stay at the Green Valley Ranch.  So glad I found this place on Yelp because my family and I really liked this place.  The fish tacos, the tacos and burritos were fresh, delicious and reasonably priced.  We loved all the jalepenos and the hot sauces (though the hot sauces weren't spicy enough for me).  The staff are really nice and the restaurant is VERY clean.  The meat in the tacos weren't fatty and the quality of the meat was good.  We loved this place and said we plan to go back on our next vacation in Vegas/Henderson."}
{"text":"Was excited to see that this place was opening in the neighborhood. I love this street style of taco.  Took son for lunch and was really impressed. We both decided to try the 3 taco combo and sample different options. For under $8 it's a bargain. The carne asada and carnitas were both fantastic but the winner for me was the fish. Fresh veggies and an avocado slice. Employees were all pleasant and engaging. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have pretty high standards for authentic Mexican food. I love giving my money to entrepreneurs like this rather than to the chains but I was disappointed. We ordered a quesadilla and torta and there was a 20 minute wait (which is fine, I get it if its all being made fresh and to order) but the Asada and Carnitas were hardly in the dish, it was all lettuce and what meat we DID get was very bland. The avocado was good and fresh, their hot sauces are nice and the Horchata was pretty good but I cant give 5 stars for a nice drink and hot sauce. I'll give it a second try but if they're stingy on the meat again, I wont bother a third time."}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to Ricos Tacos El Tio. This is a little taco joint that recently opened up where the Jack In The Box used to be. As we entered we went to the counter to order and check out menu. It took a few minutes for staff to realize we and another guest had arrived. The menu is fairly simple Tacos, Burritos and platters with combos. I ordered the Asada Burrito and added Avocado and sour cream. Josie had the fish taco. This Burrito was huge, sufficiantly filled with well seasoned asada, beans, and the above mentioned items. Fish tacos were really good. Light Flakey coating in a tortilla with slaw we added avocado as well. Everything here was fresh and filling.   Thank you for visiting Ricos Tacos El Tio. We will go here again. It;s filling, fresh and convenient. If in Henderson and need a quick fresh meal check this spot out."}
{"text":"Nice clean atmosphere for a causal meal. There is a very limited menu here as they specialize in tacos, burritos and a few other things. The condiments/salsa bar is really fresh and offers a lot of variety. I recommend trying the Vampire here but be careful sometimes it bites! The horchata here needs an overhaul but everything else tastes well made."}
{"text":"We live fairly close to this area & decided to give this place a try instead of heading over to Taco Bell. We had the steak burrito, carnitas taco & chicken tacos. All were really tasty & the burrito especially was packed with steak as opposed to some other places that fill it up with rice & beans with a little bit of meat. Glad we decided to try this spot & we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is really good fresh Mexican great service great staff highly recommended. The EL Pastor Vampiro is most delicious."}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food. This is my new spot over the other Mexican spots around town. Been there 5 times since opening day. Really great and friendly staff. Love the tacos!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I passed by this place at least numerous of times and never noticed. We were at Albertson's getting things when i finally noticed it.   So we went to try it out, very good food! My boyfriend got chicken quesadilla and I got the chicken tacos. We're really surprise that the food was not greasy at, very very  fresh. Definitely wasn't your average Roberto's taco- super greasy and not fresh.   Totally recommend anyone who is craving Mexican food fast and easy! Oh, did I mention they have a drive-thru!"}
{"text":"The authentic tastes of the barrios without having to take your white girlfriend there. This place is smack dab in greenvalley henderson so you dont have to worry about your low rider being on bricks when your done eating. Super clean and a taste of home so you can never forget where you came from #imstilljimmyfromtheblock. Amazing that it's not packed out with so many people. I think that'll be the case when the word spreads. But I kind of hope it doesn't for selfish reasons."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo much better than robertos tacos! Their food actually taste straight from a Mexican restaurant but instead it's a fast food restaurant which I love because I can always just go through the drive through and not have to always get down to get good food. I honestly recommend you all try this place you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food finally After Maribels left on eastern by target sure glad we found this place Carne Asada tacos, beans, and salsas are excellent"}
{"text":"This place is so good. First time here. Legit Mexican food. If you're vegetarian just order w/out meat! Service is great and place is super clean!   So glad we have one of these in green valley area"}
{"text":"If you want tacos at a drive-thru that are MUCH better than Taco Bell, this is it. I can only talk about the drive-thru experience for tacos and horchata. These are not going to be the best tacos you've ever tasted because it's, of course, a drive-thru. When you get the tacos, the tortillas are a little soggy because they wrap the tacos in foil while still hot. The tacos also come with salt, a slice of lime or lemon, and pickled carrots, cucumbers, and one jalapeño. I'm not that keen on the pickling juice because it just doesn't have the flavorful kick I'm used to. The best tacos to get in my opinion are the lengua and the cabeza. SO tender and flavorful. To get these two types of tacos at a local drive-thru is a blessing so you can see why I'm willing to overlook some things I'm not a fan of.   I take one star off because the one thing I can't overlook is their horchata. It is terrible and tastes chalky/unnatural like pepto-bismol. I have a strong feeling that they serve straight up mix because it tastes much better when you add water. I'd go for about 1/2-2/3rds horchata to 1/3-1/2 water. Actually, just don't get the horchata."}
{"text":"Great Authentic Food, Friendly courteous staff!  Great Value - you get a huge amount of food at great price.  I had the chicken quesadilla and it was tasty and easily enough for 2 (or more) people.  My DH got the mixed taco plate: Carnitas and Carne Asada.  The meats were all delicious.  I will definitely go back again.    Kinda tugged at my heart strings when the young manager took the bucket with melted ice out and water the outside plants with it.    Awwww.   Kim"}
{"text":"I really don't see the hype here. We tried this place yesterday and it was quite disappointing.  The tacos were the tiniest  I've ever seen, about the size of an egg roll. The carnae asada was dry and grisly, the fish taco (talapia) was all lettuce, and the fish was the size of your finger.  We ordered carnae asada nachos.. could hardly find the cheese, teeny pieces of very dry meat. Very overpriced for what they put out. We will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is really not what I was expecting at all....  Their menu is very basic, you won't find the typical combos that are on the menus at other taco shops in the area. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, just don't come here expecting rolled tacos, enchiladas and stuff like that.   I had the carne asada tacos and my hubby had a carne asada burrito. We also ordered a side of guacamole and chips. None of the combos come with rice and beans, which surprised us (there were beans in my hubby's burrito, so they obviously have them). The food was all really delicious and fresh and made to order.   I am not sure we'd go back, simply because it's out of our way and doesn't necessarily provide what we normally look for in a taco shop."}
{"text":"I come from San Diego where the Mexican food is only second to Mexico. This is a good option in Henderson for those looking for authentic Mexican food. They have street tacos, California fries and burritos, and the rest of the standard stuff. New to me was the Nevada burrito and Henderson burrito which I see I'll try next time."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. Food was average, not bad, not great. When I arrived it was 2:15 pm tried to enter & the door's were locked/jamed. So I walked around & found a door that wasn't jamed. The cashier over charged my friend $2 for her one drink, charged her for two, so watch out for that. The lead cook came to our table & gave us complementary chips & guacamole witch was nice & he also gave my friend her $2 back. Overall the guacamole was not great I've tasted better the chips are very good. My langua burrito was good, her fish tacos were great (she said). The salsa was ok (only) it's worth a taste to dine here."}
{"text":"This place is not your typical quick taco place.The vegetables are all fresh.Guacamole is fresh made daily.There special is called a Vampiros,which is like a tostado...If you like fresh food try this place.Alsothe service is friendly,and place is very clean.....We will be back real soon.Very reasonable on prices also.They are from Ca,were they get there vegetables."}
{"text":"Great staff, good food and clean place. This is always a pleasure to come to test their food."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and is probably one of the better Mexican options in the area. Service is fast and friendly. Mild and Hot sauces are very good as well and makes their food items taste even better. If you're not in the mood for the fastfood taste of Del Taco or Taco Bell and would like something closer to real Mexican tacos, quesadillas or vampiros then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"So friendly and the food is amazing! Homemade Horchata made fresh daily! The Pineapple is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Love Tacos El Tio!! Had them cater two parties now and was very satisfied! We definitely eat here regularly! Great staff and food! Thank you for bringing authentic Mexican food to Henderson!"}
