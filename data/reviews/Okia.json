{"text":"Overpricy, the food wasnt that good, the avocado were expired and the waitresse was alone for 20 tables... Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Laval, too bad it's closing... if you can before it closes try the ''lovers'' sushi and the won ton soup."}
{"text":"Good and quality Asian dishes!  Great portion and very tasty! I personally love their sushis and I always have to get their lemon grass soup. It's also a bring your own wine restaurant, perfect for dinner but they also do take outs!"}
{"text":"never really had sushi at this restaurant before but for some reason, everything else is great especially their Sizzling Filet Mignon which caught many wonderful curious attentions. The whole restaurant draw their eyes on the smokes of the plate as it was coming to my table which was really kool. The setting was nice and warm. The service was very welcoming. Most definitely coming back soon and also bring your own wine."}
{"text":"I came here with fellow Yelper Jason (the unofficial crowned King \"la roi de Laval\" ). It's an honour and pleasure of dining with his highness the right venerable King of Vimont. You see boys and girls if you need a restaurant recommendation Jason is your pimp daddy as he has hundreds of bookmarks in Laval. PM him with questions as I'm a mere amateur in understanding of food establishments in the fair sister city of Laval.    Sorry for the detour......back to the review.   They did have a lunch menu. Lunch here as either sushi or noodles? Based on a quick review of their menu I decided to go with a Chicken Pad Thai. The lunch came with a fairly typical light soup with veg and noodles. It was okay. For the main course was a fairly generous serving, minimal amount of chicken and veg and I'd concur it was closer to Quebec stir fry than a tangy tamarind based Pad Thai. It's really hard to find a good PT in Montreal and Quebec. Bangkok in the Fauborg downtown probably does the best version. Otherwise many places do their own stir fry and call it Pad Thai. Not to sound like a Willy Nilly.....but spicy fragrant, flavorful Thai food is nearly non existent in this province. Most places call them selves Asian fusion but it's more mixed menu dishes/ QC stir fry then Asian fusion in my mind.   Decor of the restaurant was clean, comfortable with nice large windows. I ask myself would I come here again? My answer is possibly......but I wouldn't rush here because of a developed craving. It's a shade above mediocre in my mind.   Service was a tad slow based on one server only being present at lunch hour. It wasn't terrible but not overly attentive. Overall a so-so experience."}
{"text":"For a place that is labeled Asian Fusion, the General Tao I was given on the lunch menu certainly lacked a fusion of flavor! Sure the texture of the meat was OK but the sauce was off and held no zest or impact to my taste buds. It felt I was served food that somehow lost its purpose once it got into the cook's hands.  Perhaps it was my mistake to take the General Tao and should have went with the sushi but the sushi prices are pretty stiff going, 5 pieces of sushi for $12? No thanks. $2 more and I can go AYCE elsewhere. Maybe they excel in Sushi and just have the generic Quebec stir-fry options that people around these parts tend to go for. The lunch menu wasn't overly exciting.  Service was very slow and my lunch consisted of a soup, main dish and jasmine tea. The soup was their generic chicken broth (won ton was $2 more... really??) and I can't comment on the jasmine tea, I never got it since we didn't see the waitress the last 20 minutes and had to rush back to work.  No thanks."}
