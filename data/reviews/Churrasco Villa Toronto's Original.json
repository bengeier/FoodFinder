{"text":"My first experience will be my last. Sausage was burnt, extremely salty, and my sandwich was basically empty. very disappointing."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from them chicken dish with rice and potatoes. It's cheap but overcooked and pretty bland."}
{"text":"This was worth the wait - We went on Saturday May 16th in the evening - we could have ordered it to go but decided to wait 15 minutes to be seated - the smells from the flaming spit were so enticing we couldn't think of another option - we sat down and saw the awards they won plastered on the windows near the waiting area - many people walked in right after us also deciding to wait - this validated our decision to wait. We sat down and I ordered a glass of Portuguese red wine and my partner order a coffee. We started with an appetizer of sausage and olives - out came some freshly cooked bread . The combination of all components was a perfect teaser for our entrees. Unfortunately we both ordered the same item - We even ordered the same 2 sides - so much for sharing. We ordered the Half Chicken with Rice Pilaf and Roasted Vegetables. The chicken was awesome - great outside flavor, perfectly juicy inside. Now for the part that made me give only 4 stars - The rice was flavorless - no seasoning - the vegetables were similar but cooked perfectly - I don't mind seasoning my own food but love when the chef can get it just right without that need.  Would definitely give it another go - Very good food."}
{"text":"Churrasco Villa is my go to spot for Portuguese-grilled chicken. The chicken is consistently good, their piri piri sauce is the perfect blend of tang and heat (which I highly recommend picking up some to go), but they always seem to be sold out of pastel de natas."}
{"text":"I frequently order from Churrasco, and even host staff meetings during non peak times in their restaurant. The food and service has always been above average, and always a great experience. That is until last week. I placed a LARGE order for a business meeting, and cutlery wasn't included. I called and was told onus was on me to request cutlery (never had to ask before), and they would deliver my cutlery only if I paid for another delivery charge. Well despite having already given the deliveryman a solid tip, I declined their solution. And unfortunately this experience put a bad taste in my mouth, enough to not order again."}
{"text":"One of the best spots in Toronto for sure.  Their specialty is the charcoal roasted chicken, there are lots of side options to choose from.   The best part of this spot in my opinion is their hot sauce.  Every time i get takeout, i buy two of them on the side.  They are not cheap, $7, but im hooked.  They stay good for up to three months in the fridge.  My only complaint is the chicken and rib combo, the ribs were small and I didn't get very many.  For $21, i felt kinda ripped off.     The other combo options are reasonably priced for portion sizes.  Every single person I've taken there or had takeout with has loved it.  100% recommended."}
{"text":"They're closed right now cause of the construction on Eg which kind of sucks. Churassco Villa is one of my favorite places to eat. Hope they open soon."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this, the half chicken, rice and roasted potatoes. The sauce was the best part, it tasted like buffalo sauce. I had the mild sauce that might be why it was like Buffalo sauce, next time I'll try the hot. The chicken was a little dry, it was seasoned well though. Roasted potatoes were cooked crispy. I might try the roasted vegetables next time rather than the rice as it was a little flavourless. They must change the vegetables, I asked what kind of vegetables they had tonight on girl said one thing and the other named some other vegetables,  they double checked and it was neither of the two. I was in there early around 4, which is likely why they weren't sure on the vegetables. Im glad I tried this place, I've been living here for over 6 years and had never noticed it. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic chicken and the roasted potatoes are delicious!! BUT the veggies that we get with the family pack, seem like they came from a bag of frozen vegetables that were barely heated.   All the staff that we've encountered are rude and act as though waiting on customers is such a bother. My family wont eat here anymore, as it is not an enjoyable environment and the staff are very unpleasant.   However, I must admit, the chicken and potatoes are so awesome that we sometimes grab take-out and make our own side of seasoned vegetables or salad at home."}
{"text":"It's smoky, it's warm, it's a little greasy & a whole lot meaty. That sauce, oh that sauce. I almost stole mine off the table, then I realized I could buy my own. We always get a chicken & ribs combo to share and a side of sausage. Wash that down with a basket of bread dripping in piri-piri and you will just roll your fine self on home & wonder why you've never been to portugal before..."}
{"text":"Went here for a company lunch a while back and have been back quite a few times since. Sadly we don't go there more often anymore as we've hired more than a few vegetarians recently, but I still find time to go with friends when I'm in the mood.  The chicken is delicious and comes in various amounts with your choice of sides. Their fries are quite good. However the rice wasn't exactly to my liking, but I'm a bit particular about that so I don't hold it against them.  Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area"}
{"text":"Very tasty chicken! I'm a huge fan of Swiss Chalet, so the chicken was on pair with them, however without the chalet sauce.  The sauce on the table was interesting, but a previous poster mentioned it was margarine which made me puke in my mouth a little bit.  Overall, fries were decent, roasted potatotes tasty and the chicken was nice and moist.  I thought it would be dry at first because I didn't use much of that yellow sauce but the leg was definitely juicy.  Service was decent, normal."}
{"text":"Wanted to try Portuguese BBQ with a friend and found this place on Yelp based on places near by. It's not the nicest place, but the food is pretty good, especially for the price. The portions were very filling. I got the standard 2 pieces of BBQ chicken with two sides- vegetables and roast potatoes. Vegetables were plain, but I appreciated that they were quite healthy and not over cooked or smothered in butter like most restaurants. Potatoes and chicken were great and cooked well. However, I've had better BBQ chicken and it was slightly dry. I'm glad I went for the dark meet, because my friend's white meat looked even drier."}
{"text":"Amazing. Quality  I had the pleasure of ordering the Beef ribs. Most restaurants interpret charring as burning the meat till it's crispy. The ribs I received were slightly charred and actually added a nice texture and flavour to the meat. The barbeque sauce was also equally as delectable as it wasn't overly sweet but just enough for taste.  My most pleasant surprise came in the form of the 2 sides I ordered, salad and steamed vegetables. I was happy to see actual fresh vegetables that were cut in house and not out of a frozen bag. Vegetables that come out of a bag are definitely one of my pet peeves and I believe they have no place in a restaurant. This small touch, is what cemented the quality of the restaurant to me.   On my way out I had to compliment the chefs because of the attention to detail that is sorely lacking amongst other restaurants. If you are in the area and want quality, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"- Nice place (but small) - Good service - Reasonable prices  - Good amount of food - Very tasty (half chicken, Pasta with chicken creamy rose sauce) - Not too many options in the menu"}
{"text":"Delicious food, cannot be denied.  However, service is APPALLING! They treat you like they're doing you a favour! Food is very overpriced and TWICE already they have not included all the items in my take-out order. I know, shame on me for not checking my bags, but I would expect a business to have better quality control.  With other churrasco options in the city, I cannot recommend going here."}
{"text":"I refer to this place as \"swiss chalet on crack\". And for those who know me well, they know how much I like Swiss Chalet for easy dinners. Churrasco has your standard chicken dinner which is what I typically order (1/4 chicken, fries, veggies), but the chicken is Portuguese style so it is much tastier than other places! The chicken has a great seasoning and the sauce is delicious! The sauce is a tad on the spicy side for my taste but it's so good I still put it on everything! The ribs are also amazing and juicy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic chicken. When you're eating corporate, fast-food chain grub, some part of you knows that originally, that soulless food came from something significantly better. The Big Mac that just can't possibly compare to the homemade hamburger patty with fresh cheese. Well if you're ever wondering where that Swiss Chalet sauce and chicken came from, this is it (Warning: I have no idea whether they have anything to do with each other).  This is the best grilled chicken I've ever had, with some of the most addictive sauce I've ever tasted. The wood fired grill really comes through with each bite. Go here, get the massive meat platters, and be happy you did. Wings, seafood, everything is great off that grill. And the smell coming from the kitchen... heart and soul, that's what it is.  Just make sure you get reservations. This place is full, and deservedly so."}
{"text":"3.5/5 only because they aren't consistent! Ordered the 1 chicken family meal with veggies and potatoes. Can't beat the value - just over $30 to feed 3 hungry people with extra sauce on the side. It's great for nights where I don't feel like cooking but still want to watch what I'm eating.  Last night I got takeout and it blew us away - SO GOOD. Chicken was moist and fresh. Got takeout a few weeks ago - not so much. The variety of vegetables consisted of broccoli, cauli and carrots when last night there were at least 5 types of veg! The chicken in my order from a few weeks ago was extremely dry and it seemed that the portion was smaller? Bread has been hard and almost stale both times :(  This would be 5/5 if the meals were always like what I got last night. The sauce is to die for. This is still one of the best healthy alternative places in Y&E and overall is the best value - SO glad I don't have to eat Swiss Chalet to get my chicken fix!"}
{"text":"My review is based on take-out from Churrasco.  I've been here a couple of times for take-out and thankfully there wasn't any long line. There is a huge menu board up behind the cash and one can see that this place offers a variety of chicken meals, seafood, a nice selection of sides, desserts and more. The staff is kind and efficient and the prices are reasonable. My half chicken with two sides came to something around $11-$12 and was handed over to me within 5 minutes after ordering it.  The chicken is cooked rotisserie style over a large charcoal oven and smells so good! The chicken is cooked beautifully- juicy, tender and the skin is crispy. The pri-pri sauce was very spicy and tasted excellent with the meat.  Also, the side of rice of potatoes were really good too. The rice was plenty, flavourful and topped off with a few black and green olives. The roast potatoes had their crispy skin on them and marinated in a delicious spicy oil sauce. The potions are generous and satisfying.  The only downfall about this place is that the food is placed in a black styrofoam box. I'm not a big fan of hot food placed in styrofoam- yuck. Also, they're a bit stingy with the pri-pri sauce. However, this won't stop me from coming back because the food is good.  If you're looking for some yummy Portuguese style chicken, I would definitely recommend Churrasco!"}
{"text":"Okay, here it goes..   As a lover of BBQ chicken, this location compared to it's sisters and competitors is a clear winner. People talk about Nando's, but they don't come close in quality.   Chicken is crispy and tender, sides are good. I love that open flame grille atmosphere.   I just wish the piri-piri was a bit more spicy.. haha   Recommendation : BBQ Sardinha's   Information before you go: no parking at the front of the restaurant, so you will have to look for a Green P (just a 5min walk), The seating is tightly spaced & there is an open flame grille, so be cautious of what you wear."}
{"text":"There really is only one reason why this place isn't getting 5 stars from me and it was the service.  Having said that, if I could, I'd go four and a half stars as it really wasn't her fault as the place was jammed full, plus a constant line-up of \"take-outers\".  The chicken was great which begs the question...what are you doing in the swiss chalet across the street???"}
{"text":"Great food, great value. I came here many times. They have enough room to host an average 15-20 person group and they have plenty of space on the lower floor. The service has always been good. You really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Woohoo! Chicken for dinner again!!   Although narrow, the interior is actually quite spacious and accommodates even large groups; with some waiting.  Walking in, we only had to wait 15 min; not bad for 8 pm on a Friday night.  The menu is short and simple; all I saw was chicken, chicken, chicken and ribs.  I went with their 1/2 chicken with roasted potatoes and veggies.  When food was served my first thought was that the portion was quite small compared to other Portuguese restaurants (but they were all take out).  I had a huge appetite so maybe my hunger was judging the portion.  I found the chicken a little dry but the amazing house sauce saved the day!  No complaints about the roasted potatoes (they were delicious!) But wish they would top up the veggy a little.  I also paired my meal with some Portuguese beer, Super Bock I believe.  We also ordered their chicken pasta with rosé sauce to share.  It was gooooood! Totally recommend it if BBQ chicken or ribs are not your thing.  Forgot to mention, they do serve fresh hot bread to get you ready for the main.  I should also note that servers were swift and pleasant.  Would go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Delivery sucks! The food is good but always arrives cold as ice and stuff missing. I've ordered a few times and it's always the same problem so not a fluke. The breast and wings didn't come with any wings, and what was supposed to be a double order of fries was barely enough as one order. Sorry, Churrasco, that's my last time ordering for delivery."}
{"text":"I've worked around this area for years and have always put off going to this restaurant because it really doesn't look like much from the outside.  The sign is dated and the front looks a bit grotto-ish.  I was really dubious about how good the food would be.  I really regret it now.  I wish I had found this place sooner.  The chicken is DELICIOUS.  I usually get the wrap (which is GREAT), and it comes with two sides.  The fries are amazing (thin, not the usually crappy fries) and the salad is really, really tasty.  The sandwich is similar to the wrap, but comes in a yummy bun.  You get plenty of food with your order - I always leave full.  The best part is that it's really decently priced.  A favourite - so glad that I found this place."}
{"text":"This is my Go-To restaurant. Whenever I need the can't miss place, it has to be here.  The menu isn't extensive and it's a bit too cozy in certain spots in the restaurant, and on the rare occasion, the service isn't 100%, but this place is great.  Wonderful fresh cut fries, I double that order whenever I can. Stay away from the mixed vegetables and get the rapini instead,  it's a $4 charge, but way better than those awful vegetables. But that's it, otherwise it's an awesome place."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Recommended if you are in the area. Try not to sit near the door, constant stream of takeout people can be distracting."}
{"text":"A cozy friendly place for delicious chicken.    I was craving some food after a cold late afternoon run and a friend recommended Churrasco for some amazing chicken.    There wasn't a line waiting but then again it was around 5pm on a Sunday so I was very pleased.    I opted for the quarter chicken with the two sides and was very pleased with the chicken and also found their spicy sauce to be amazing.    I didn't find the dish complex and if that's what you're looking for this probably isn't the place for you.  However if you want a nice meal for a reasonal price which fast, friendly service then this place is the right place to be.    The chicken may keep me coming for more but I definitely want to try other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Big fan of the Portuguese chicken and roasted potatoes. I used to live in the Yonge and Eglinton neighbourhood and so would order from here relatively frequently. I have never eaten in the restaurant so can not comment on the service, but have learned that when you're ordering for pick up you need to specifically ask for utensils as they do not automatically include them in the order.  I would also recommend checking you have everything in your order before leaving because multiple times they have forgotten to include the drink I've ordered but they are always apologetic when I call and let them know. If you're looking for chicken that's of a similar ilk as Swiss Chalet but far more flavourful I would definitely recommend Churrasco definitely gets my vote! Their sauces are also super tasty - my mouth is watering just thinking of the sauce."}
{"text":"Love the chicken, and the 'hot sauce' that goes with it and everything else! Love the potatoes. Love the Portuguese tarts for dessert! I mean I guess I can see why it's overall an acquired taste and that some sceptics come and don't see what the big deal is. I think it's just a preference thing. Like how some people don't like Swiss Chalet and their chicken sauce. To each their own, but me love Churrasco!  Fair word of warning they have an open kitchen so you will indeed smell of smoke and BBQ!"}
{"text":"Dinner  It was busy with take out clients and those dining inside.   What we ordered Portuguese sausage with cornbread: sausage was good, but instead of cornbread we got regular bread and were told it was cornbread repeatedly. Hate being lied to.   Pirri Pirri chicken with 2 sides- roasted potatoes and veggies: instead of roasted veggies we got some broccoli.  Steak with the same 2 sides- same issue with he roasted veggie side  It took ages for dishes to be served.   Only positives about this place are decent food & good portion-size for the price-point, decently priced drinks list, they make their own pirri pirri sauce and friendly staff.  Repeat: Not for dine in. Maybe for take out. They are better set up for it. However, they seem to take on more than they can handle,and in the process capable of cutting corners. So keep an eye out."}
{"text":"their chicken grilled with charcoal is just amazing.   yes there are always a line up to get a table, line up for pick up and long wait for delivery....it's because it's GOOD"}
{"text":"This restaurant is my go to in my neighborhood when I have a craving for Portuguese charcoal grilled chicken. I haven't dine there only take out. I call ahead and it's usually ready in 30 mins. Their piri piri is not too spicy for me and the chicken is juicy and succulent. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it. They certainly know how to do chicken right. Give them a try and don't forget to ask them for the piri piri sauce.  It's all about the sauce."}
{"text":"It's good. Good Chicken. That's all that matters right  Ordered double leg and thigh with salad and fries. The chicken was pretty good. Cooked just right and the charcoal  adds a nice flavour. I actually didn't enjoy the peri peri sauce that much. Wasn't that spicy and too much vinegar. I've definitely had much better sauce at other places Fries were meh   But good meal overall. I'd come back just won't be craving that much"}
{"text":"Liked the chicken (although didnt find it as smoky as I had expected after reading some of the other reviews). Apart from the breasts, the pieces were really juicy. The breast pieces were a little too dry, but this problem was easily solved by dunking it in the Piri Piri sauce.   Got potatoes and rice on the side. The potatoes were good, but I did not like the rice at all.   The piri piri sauce was only okay. However I think its better at other Portuguese chicken places.   Prices are a little on the high side.  Street parking only. It's about a 5-10min walk from Eglinton station."}
{"text":"I always go to this place and order take out, so by far service has been good, i get my order taken promptly after i come in, after that i just wait about 7-10 minutes and the food is ready. The chicken is juicy, delicious with a nice charcoal taste, the rice is very good as well, roasted potatoes are average, their piripiri sauce is average, i had better before."}
{"text":"I went to Churrasco's this evening with my girlfriend for dinner.  Here are the positives: - we arrived at around 8pm with no reservation and were seated promptly. - the wait staff were very attentive and were flexible with varying up an order (I wanted two sides of veggies rather than one potato, one veggie as suggested on the menu). - the food was served to us quite promptly. I don't think we waited more than ten mins between the time our order was taken to the time that it was brought to us. - there was an adequate amount of lighting. - the restaurant was fairly busy, yet it was not so noisy that we couldn't speak at normal levels at the table. - as stated in the prior review, a nice touch at the end of the meal was the providing of the large size wet-nap. - the food itself was satisfactory. I ordered the quarter smoked chicken plate for $12.99. The chicken was cooked just right, though, if I were to come back next time, I'd probably order the boneless chicken for $16.99 as it was quite an effort and quite a mess to deal with the chicken bones. The veggies were simply steamed and required the adding of some pepper and ketchup. For dessert we ordered the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream, which was an excelled way to top off the meal.   Negatives:  - as the restaurant is located on busy Eglinton Avenue, parking is not ideal. We had to search for a spot on a side street and then walk in the fridgid weather for a few minutes."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem for most of Toronto. It is truly next-level amazing. Try the hot Piri-piri sauce.  I really don't think this place needs reviews, it's just that great. What can you say about perfect BBQ chicken?"}
{"text":"This restaurant turned my idea of the churrasquiera experience upside-down.    A double-leg dinner was ordered with a side of roasted potatoes and steamed vegetables.  Others at the table opted to go with half chicken dinners with the same sides.  Having frequented other churrasquiera restaurants in the past I thought it was custom for the chicken to be on the dry side since the crispy exterior is the selling point.  Imagine the surprise when I bit into the double leg dinner which had crispy skin - which was expected and a very juicy interior - which was not.  The steamed vegetables lacked salt and the potatoes were slightly on the greasy side - but all of that was made up for when they were dipped into the true star of the dinner:  the Piri-Piri sauce.   There were two kinds of hot sauce:  mild and hot.  Again, expecting the sauce to be nothing but salty like other restaurants have taught me to refrain from touching, this sauce was a perfect combination of tanginess and spiciness.  I ate the sauce with bread, with potatoes, with steamed vegetables, with chicken - and before I knew it half the bottle was demolished.  Yes it was that good that I would buy a bottle home to dip with home-cooked dinners.  One tip for the chicken-lovers:  from my friends who tried both the double-leg and the half-chicken - the double-leg was the clear winner as the white meat portion of the half chicken suffered from dryness.  All in all, this restaurant deserves a return visit when I am feeling particularly hungry for a comforting meaty dinner.  Or maybe just when I am Piri-Piri hungry."}
{"text":"So this place is great for people who love a whole meat fest. Grilled chicken, ribs, and more. Plus the sides are great. Kinda noisy for a talking, but hey - you're here to chomp on those wings. Make sure to get the hand cut fries. Best thing ever."}
{"text":"amazing food and service. Get the drummets which are tremendous. Also half chicken dinner with the veggies is very satisfying. I usually get delivery but finally sat down there and the server was very kind and attentive, Most important part of this place is the heeri peeri sauce, put it on EVERYTHING, I like the spicy one but they have a milder one for those that don't want too much kick"}
{"text":"Churrasco is my go to place in the Yonge and Eglinton area because of the amazing food. I took my wife there for the first time and order the platter for sharing and it was amazing. The food and service was great and the Piri Piri sauce was amazing and made from scratch, they sell them individually so I ended up buying a bottle of mild.   I wish they had the fish fillet dinners like other churrasqueiras but I was extremely satisfied with the food and service. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places in the neighbourhood. The chicken sandwiches are great. So are the fries. They have little competition because food at Mt Pleasant and Eglinton leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"My mission to find the best Portuguese chicken and Piri Piri sauce in the city continues!  Seeing as I was staying in the area for the weekend, I figured I'd take advantage of the convenience.  I went in for an early Sunday linner, around 5pm, and there were a few people waiting for take out.  I opted for the double leg and thigh, at $10.99 with two sides.  When I was told that the vegetables were broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots, it sounded too much like a frozen mix bag that I've been served by my mom a million times.  Not my favourite childhood memory, and not what I want for a side.  To be fair, I didn't confirm my suspicion, I just opted for the classic rice and potatoes.    They were pretty quick to get my meal ready, and it smelled delicious.  The first thing I tried was a potato with some piri piri sauce (I'd chosen hot rather than mild).  I was disappointed.  The sauce was watery in consistency, and really wasn't that spicy.  The potatoes were okay but nothing special.  The rice had some flavouring but I wasn't that impressed.  The chicken though.  The chicken was delicious.  The flavour went past the seasoning on the skin and that in the hot sauce, right down deep into the meat itself.  It was fantastic.  I'm very curious to try their chicken wings, as I'm sure they would also be very tasty.  All in all, speedy service, delicious chicken, but I still felt disappointed by the accompaniments.  A good piri piri is essential to good Portuguese chicken, and without it I can understand why so many reviewers are comparing it to Swiss Chalet.  3.5 stars just for the chicken, but I have to round down based on everything else."}
{"text":"If there's one type of restaurant that I'd like to see more of in Toronto, it's Churrascos. Most of them are near Little Italy or St Clair. The north side of GTA really needs some Portuguese chicken places.   Compared to other Portuguese places I've tried, the smokiness of the chicken here is off the charts! Half chicken with 2 sides comes out to be around $14-15 after tax. I like how you can mix and match different chicken parts. You can get double legs for example. For 2 sides, I've yet to find a better combination than rice and potatoes. It's god like! And in my opinion, this place makes the best piri piri sauce.   Similar to Bairrada, the grill is in the open kitchen. You will smell the wonderful BBQ as soon as you walk in. It smells nice but I wouldn't want to dine in. I'll smell like chicken by the time I leave, which probably isn't such a bad thing. But I usually get take out as the place always looks full.   Price wise it's on the high side for Portuguese chicken. A lot of the smaller shops sell half chicken dinners for under $10 + tax. It's slightly more expensive than Bairrada and the portion is slightly smaller, but I think the extra smokiness makes it worth it.   Highly recommended, especially if you don't live near Little Portugal/Italy and don't want to make the trek to get there."}
{"text":"Ummm ... how do I even start?  I had a craving for Portuguese chicken and I stumbled across Churrasco Villa on Yelp. I decided to get a combo platter of 1/4 white and ribs with a side of grilled vegetables just so I could get a taste of everything.  Well ... you know what?  I sat in my hotel room and I ATE IT ALL!!!  It was so good, I just could not help myself. The food was amazing even after a 25 minute drive back to my hotel.   Other yelpers have felt that the white meat chicken was dry, but I did not think so.  The spices on the outside were perfect.  The ribs were sticky and tender and among the best I have had.  The grilled vegetables - while a little heavy on the peppers - had nice variety and were well grilled.    I will be honest and tell you that I have had better piri piri sauce elsewhere, but it was certainly acceptable and the deliciousness of the rest of the food easily overcame this small detail.  Be aware that there is no parking available at this location.  Although I have only eaten here once, I have to believe that the pork ribs / 1/4 chicken combo platter is the best way to go - you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Each time I go to Toronto, I try to make time to dine at Churrasco Villa...usually dine-in but one summer evening a few years ago, I picked up a whole chicken and some sides and met up with my sister and her friend for a picnic dinner on Toronto Island.  I usually have one or two pieces of chicken leg and the flavour from the grill is amazing--I normally don't even add more sauce at the table. The rice is a favourite side and the fire-grilled vegetables is a lovely dish as well.  On my most recent visit, I had room for dessert and so we ordered a pasteis de nata each which will be included in our order for all future visits! The custard was light and not too sweet and the size is quite manageable no matter how much chicken you've eaten...a nice taste of sweetness to round out the meal.  I wish I could rate this as 4.5 stars...I had to knock off one star because even though it's a sure-repeat for me, the service our group received a few weeks ago was odd. The server appeared to be dissatisfied with the amount of food that we ordered and he barely stood at our table long enough to cover off the essential tasks involved (it was not a particularly busy time). One of our party was a 5-yr old--what did he expect? It may have been an off-night--who knows but it was noticeable enough to affect the evening."}
{"text":"I am very sad to learn that Toronto's Original Churrasco Villa is currently closed, due to the incessant and never ending construction of Metro-Linx. It's a very sad state of affairs that the city of Toronto cannot , (or will not), co-operate with the owners of Churassco Villa enough to keep the Eglinton- Mt.Pleasant location open.  The beef ribs, Baby back pork ribs and chicken here all have, ( had), a really authentic Churrasco smokey taste that was complimented by a fabulous Piri-Piri sauce in spicy and hot varieties that was some of the best if not the best in the city.  The salads, Bifannas, ( Portuguese sandwiches), potato wedges and Custard Tarts are unforgettable.  I really miss this place and hope that it re-opens when all the dust from the Eglinton construction finally clears."}
{"text":"Excellent grilled chicken~! Love the double legs~! Juicy and well seasoning. Have to say that Portuguese grilled chicken are the best! Sardines are pretty good too~ my boyfriend said back home they don't even gut the sardines XD love the passion fruit juicy~ home made piri piri sauce is fabulous too, well balancing of sour and spicy, love it!"}
{"text":"Ahhh, went here over the winter with some co-workers and it's definitely a place to try.  I got their half chicken dinner with fries and salad and the dish is overloaded with flavour and deliciousness.  It's not easy to find portuguese style food around here and I would recommend those who have tried piri piri to come here.  Food: 4/5, the chicken was moist and the piri piri sauce goes very well with it.  The fries were crispy and the salad was fresh with mixed vegetables (greens, onions, olives) and the portions are quite large if you are hungry.  Ambience: 3/5, it's a little dark and the tables are small but all in all, it's a quite place for a nice lunch.  No complaints here.  Service: 3/5, very regular and your drinks/water and filled up often.  The guy who seems to own the place was very courteous.  Price: 4/5, about $15 per person.  The price is reasonable and the food is delicious - all good from me."}
{"text":"I've lived down the street from Churrasco Villa for about 8 years now and I fell in love with their chicken since my first bite. I'm there quite regularly. You can smell the charcoal rotisserie from at least two blocks away in any direction and it's just blissful. I've often thought of bottling that scent and dabbing it behind my ears to make the men in my neighbourhood trail after me in a cartoonish wafting hover.   I usually order the same thing: double leg chicken dinner with house salad and French fries and the hot piri piri sauce. If you eat in, they give you a lovely basket of potato bread that is fresh, dense and delicious. If you takeout or get it delivered, you lose out on the bread, which is a shame. Eating in also offers the benefit of these lovely little chewy Portuguese candies after the meal (like the Portuguese version of a Starburst candy), which you also don't receive if you takeout or have the meal delivered.   I've tried other things on their menu: the sardinhas (delicious and plentiful!), the grilled calamari (perfectly cooked and tender, served with fresh tomato salsa), the huge beef ribs and the even more gargantuan bison ribs, which look like something from the Flintstones that would tip the car over because they're just so big and heavy. They were divine and saucy and meaty and perfectly prepared. Their traditional custard-filled pastries are the ideal after-dinner mild sweet.  I've ordered from their catering menu for my sister's wedding rehearsal dinner and everything was delivered hot, fresh, on time, and reasonably priced.  If you're a regular at Swiss Chalet, then you don't know what you're missing. This is exponentially better tasting food at a similar price point. I will be a regular here long after I move out of the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 6 which turned into 10 last minute, which the staff quickly and efficiently accommodated for. Tough for busy dining-out nights like Saturdays! Our server was really friendly, organized and catered to our party really well. Food was delicious; flavorful & succulent! The balsamic sauce on the salmon dish was great! Everyone seemed pretty satisfied with their meals. Portions are really big and since the dishes were tasty it made up for the pricier costs - but nothing out of the ordinary for a night on the town  approx. $20+ a plate. Only downside IMO was it was really hot inside in  warmer weather and there's not a whole lot of dining space. There is also no baby change station in the bathroom, although they do have a chair in there for breastfeeding. Overall, good experience! We'd go back again!"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday a little after 5:30pm and there was plenty of space. Previous Yelp reviews all made it seem amazing, so I had high hopes! I ordered the Churrasco grilled chicken penne pasta with rose sauce and they ordered the half chicken meal with rice and the seasonal vegetables.  The pasta sauce was very thick and creamy and their portion size was large. The chicken wasn't that flavourful and the cuts were rather small. The half chicken meal was apparently flavourful, but dry and the rice and vegetable sides were okay, but nothing too special.  Service was okay, nothing extraordinary, but I was a little surprised to find the environment of the restaurant rather loud, both from other customers but also the open grill/kitchen environment. Overall, nothing too special, so don't think I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I know it sounds gross, but I LOVE their homemade sauce (which is mostly margarine). Dip it with bread. Dip it with meat. Dip it on anything edible.  It is one of the few places in town that I have found so far that roast chicken and meat on charcoal... the flavour is outstanding! Everything off the grill taste great if you like real BBQ flavour.  The staff is friendly. Space is a bit tight, so you might want to arrive early if you are expecting a crowd larger than 4.  This is the go-to-place when I want BBQ meat at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"One of the best churrasco restaurants in uptown Toronto. Very well priced. Offers takeout and delivery. Hidden gem: Chicken wings and \"chewy\" ribs. One of few places to serve stick-to-the-bone ribs in the city. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My boss is crazy about this place. I think they're meh. I find that their chicken is a bit dry. Their veggies are always overcooked. Their rice is nothing fancy, same as their potato and fries. I'd take Nando's over them any day. I do enjoy their peri-peri sauce though. My food just swims in that every time I have their food... since I find everything else meh.  Since my boss just loves the place, we order from them at least every other month... It's always the same, bland experience."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever tried Portuguese food, but Churrasco really embodied a warm, casual European vibe. We had less than an hour to eat, but our server was very nice and we our food arrived within five minutes of ordering. We both requested chicken, which you can pair with two of the following sides: rice pilaf, fries, vegetables, or potatoes. I had the fries and veggies, but the chicken definitely took the spotlight. My portion was slightly burnt on the bottom, but quite juicy and even better with their sauces. Overall we were quite content with the filling yet affordable meal.  P. S. If you're driving there is free street parking on Roehampton Ave. to the north"}
{"text":"This is a Portuguese chicken and rib restaurant.  I can't give this more than 3 stars because to me, it is just a slightly-better version of Swiss Chalet. The menu consists largely of quarter chicken dinners, half-chicken dinners, rib dinners, etc.  You do however get your choice of two sides (fries, roasted potatoes, rice, or veggies), which is nice,  and choice of a mild or spicy dipping sauce.  The spicy sauce is VERY spicy!  I've only had the chicken but it is always tasty and a nice big portion.  The only thing that I don't like is that the steamed veggies seem to just be huge chunks of cauliflower and broccoli, with a few baby carrots.  Random.  Of course I hate cauliflower so that is probably a large part of my issue.  I have been here for both eat-in and take-out.  One warning:  If you eat in, some seats are very close to the open grill where they grill the chicken and ribs.  And even if your seat is not close, the smell from the grill does fill the restaurant, so when you get home, you WILL smell slightly like burnt chicken.  Just an FYI.  I also find it to be a little warm in there in summer."}
{"text":"I had the Churrasco Villa Toronto drummettes with fries and vegetables. It was mediocre.  I was expecting much better after reading the reviews.  My husband had the baby back ribs and chicken combo. Ribs were a bit dry. He was also disappointed with the meal.  But the service was excellent! We were a large group and all the food came at the same time. It's great for children.  I wouldn't go back. I actually prefer Swiss Chalet."}
{"text":"We rarely come to Toronto without a stop in here. The chicken melts in your mouth and their sauce is just hot enough to tingle, but immensely flavourful. We always get a bottle or two to take home.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Just get the whole chicken and forget the sides. Best charcoal grilled chicken in Toronto but their sides are not worth it. Sure beats the rotisserie churrasco."}
{"text":"Best Portuguese bbq in the city. Real open flame rotisserie. The only negative is there isn't good parking for takeout."}
{"text":"I just don't get it. After reading the reviews, I told my daughter about this place and she asked me to get her some ribs. To make the story short I ended up driving to Swiss chalet, because my husbands ribs were sooo overwhelmingly blah sorta dry and an overwhelming flavour of rosemary or marjoram.... The chicken was bland and dry. I ordered the rice pilaf and the roasted vegetables instead of the steamed veggies for an extra $3.99. The zuchinni tasted off, not sure if it had been taken in and out of the fridge back and forth. The bread was cold and when I asked the server to heat it up for me  and I was told that it was meant to be eaten cold. Oookay.  The highlight of the meal was the piri piri sauce.. it was tart, garlicky and well flavoured. Over all place is  charming, but too bad about the food.. is it that I arrived at the wrong time (6:30pm)? I so wanted to find a place to go and get my chicken fixing.. and unfortunately I will have to continue on my search..."}
{"text":"Went there with a large group of people. Usually when you do that and they are not ready for it, the quality goes down, and it seemed to this time. The BBQ ribs were burnt and the chicken was bland. The special sauce they leave on the table made it very good but if you don't like spice, don't bother with it.   If I were to try the place again, I would go in with a small group and use the sauce at the beginning of the meal, not near the end.   The side dishes were boring as well."}
{"text":"Went there for a group dinner after a seminar at the recommendation of one of the group. The decor was simple but the smell of the food cooking was so good.   We were seated at the back and for 9 pm it was filled with diners.  I ordered the quarter chicken dinner. When it arrived it was perfectly crisp was delicious delicious vegetables and potatoes on the side I was really amazed how nice it was. Some of the other diners ordered the beef ribs and they look like something from a Fred Flintstone story huge amazing delicious looking beef ribs.  I almost wish I had ordered some but i wasn't that hungry. I ordered a bottle of Portuguese beer to go with meal and was very happy with the entire deal. Overall it cost me just around $25 including tax and tip a pretty fair exchange for the food I received highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times getting take out and sitting down sometimes with my company. I must say, this place is a better version of swiss chalet with really good prices and tastier sides. I usually sit down with a group of 4-6 and order the same quarter chicken with fries and rice and it is delicious!  The entrance of the restaurant is essentially a grill where you can smell the charcoal and the yummy chicken being made. The service is very quick, decent and likeable.  The service is not exceptional but they just get the job done, you order food they give you food end of story.  When the food arrives though, it leaves you craving for more and more. The chicken has a nice crispy skin, the fries are amazing and the rice tastes great. The charcoal used to cook the chicken can really be tasted since it adds so much flavour to it. However, the real reason why I keep craving for this chicken has to be their piri-piri sauce. There are two options for the sauce, mild and spicy. The mild version has a nice taste to it but if you want the best flavour opt with the spicier sauce. They come in bottles which you must shake before you use it. The spicy one is not THAT spicy but I can't handle heat that well so i generally just mix the two.  The sauce, the chicken, the rice, the potatoes, the fries... Just thinking about it makes me want to go there right now and get some takeout. This place also has very good lunch deals so if you are ever around this area and can't decide what to eat and want a quick lunch or dinner make sure to check this place out. The chicken is great, the sauce is AMAZING and the sides are great. Albeit, not the most decorated and friendliest place but the chicken and sauce itself is worth the visit."}
{"text":"We ordered pork ribs and chicken wings. The ribs were smaller than I expected, but the wings were delicious. For the price we paid I expected better quality of ribs and more food. Other authentic Portuguese items on the menu are worth checking out, but I probably wouldn't come back, unless I'm feeling really lazy. For instance, Wylie's Pub at 1234 Yonge St. offers much better value for your money and they have a $13 ribs+wings combo every day, as well as delicious Thai food."}
{"text":"Hmmm how can I describe how delicious the food tastes with just mere words?  By far the BEST Portuguese food place in the City! Good portion sizes, always fresh, never a long wait...and the homemade Piri Piri sauce is AMAZING! The dressing on the salad is also incredible.   The servers could be a bit friendlier, but they're quick and provide great service.  They're probably exhausted as this place is usually packed.   The decore is simple yet gives a cozy homey feeling which adds to the warm fuzzy feeling I get eating their food.  Did I mention how yummy the Piri Piri is?  Only 2 downfalls: No parking and the dank washrooms in the basement.  But it is usually the norm in that area."}
{"text":"My chicken was dry and the vegetables looked like they were canned. The decor leaves a lot to be desired. Our server left my glass empty the entire time meanwhile there were two other people in the restaurant. Not worth it. Almost $50 for two basic chicken meals and a beer."}
{"text":"I knew that I wouldn't have the energy to cook tonight. Lucky for me this place was on my walk home so I stopped for some takeout.   Got a half chicken order, with mild sauce and fries.   The chicken was tender and warm, enough for two sittings. Felt like I stopped at a friend's BBQ.   You're allowed two sides (e.g. Veggies, baked potatoes, etc) but I wasn't happy with the choices so doubled up on the fries. They are really more 'frites' than fries btw (small handcut fries in true European fashion. Yum.)  I also ordered two natas (custard pastry). It was also good, but but expensive and not the best I've had.  I thought the meal was satisfactory, short of the fries being a bit cold and the dessert not  super fresh (but not stale).   I'm sure that if I hadn't lived in little Portugal and enjoyed these meals in a more authentic way, I would lend an extra star to the meal lol.   For now, it's good enough and good to go! And a great 'fast food' alternative, ESP if you can skip the fries unlike yours truly ;)  I RECOMMEND- the sauce. Don't pass up the sauce. It's the whole point. African spices incorporated into Portuguese cuisine. Can't go wrong.   EXTRA TIP- I'd take to go. The chicken is cooked on site which is great for your taste buds but not for your clothes/hair.   I.e. whole place is kind of smoky/ full of aromas."}
{"text":"Awesome charcoal grilled Portuguese chicken and ribs.  Great spot for good solid food at a reasonable price.  Smell the charcoal as you walk into the restaurant!  While there are plenty of entrees, our dining companions who were there many times previous advised on the order... we ordered plenty o' chicken and ribs for six people that they put on one big platter to share, plus a side of rice and another side of their yummy roast potatoes with some token vegetables.  Food cost after tax before tip (for a lot of food) was about $20/pp.  Nice touch was full size scented hand/face wipes after the meal, no miserable little Handi-Wipes here!  Unfortunately no draft beer, only bottles (its no biggie though, one doesn't come here to drink alot).  Restaurant temperature is warm as its an open grill, as I said, you can smell the charcoal!  You may want to call ahead for reservations.  I guess its 5 stars... I don't know what they could do much better, other than the draft beer.  I didn't check out the washrooms though.  ETA - Dropped this to a 4 after the fact because I only visited once... should visit more!"}
{"text":"Does anyone know if they will reopen again after construction sure do miss the place. Always great service and food is wonderful you can smell the excitement as soon as you walk in the door."}
{"text":"They market themselves as \"The best Portuguese piri-piri chicken in Toronto...\" I've only eaten five or six so I can't speak for ALL the Portuguese chicken in the city but Churrasco Villa's is the best I've had so this place gets 5 stars for the food!  We ordered the grilled tiger shrimp and the double leg chicken dinner. Grilled shrimp don't get any better than this. Really.  I ordered rice pilaf and roast potatoes with the chicken. The rice pilaf was OK. The roast potatoes were well-cooked so they were nice and soft and they come with a dill dipping sauce. The chicken was perfect. (How does the Swiss Chalet down the street manage to stay in business??) Anyway, they bring two bottles of piri-piri sauce to the table - one mild and one hot. I find the mild is too mild and the hot is too hot so I used my side plate to mix the two to get it just the way I like it.  And not surprisingly, they carry Sumol - the Portuguese version of San Pellegrino. I recommend the passion fruit flavour.  Unfortunately, they don't have much in terms of selection for dessert so we passed.  The food here gets a 5 but I'm deducting half a point for the outdated website and half a point for the uninspiring digs.  Oh, and the little chewy Portuguese candies they give you with the bill are really good!"}
{"text":"Slow service and extremely rude staff destroy this eatery with otherwise good food.  Do not EVER try to order takeout or delivery on a Sunday night; your food will never arrive on time (if at all) and good luck getting any satisfaction with the folks who answer the phone.  They don't respond and are not customer oriented."}
{"text":"I've eaten here, on-and-off, for years. It was a go-to place for a while, then their menu and staff changed a couple of years ago.  The food remained consistent - GREAT grilled items, very good piri-piri, decent sides, but the value proposition dropped. The new menu included only one side with your main, for more money. So you're paying a pretty penny compared to the parts of town where Portuguese people hang out, but it is Yonge & Eg, with the associated real estate costs I suppose.  The real killer for me was the consistently terrible and occasionally rude service lately. It's always been a bit tightly packed and not-quite-comfortable, but add the bad service and despite the good food, Churrasco has become a take-out only option.  They're asking about parking below - and FYI, there isn't really any convenient parking in the immediate area."}
{"text":"This place serves the best chicken in Toronto, their Piri Piri puts Nando's to shame, and their bread is perfect vehicle for sopping up every last drop of oily goodness!! LOVE that this place is walking distance from home, because I defs need a little walk (waddle) after leaving this place!"}
