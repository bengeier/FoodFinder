{"text":"I LOVE dive bars. The first time I came here, felt like this could be my new neighborhood spot. Go to Dave's Place if you want a good, friendly place to drink. I didn't feel welcome here after some new advertising on yelp. Apparently, if you haven't been frequenting this place, they aren't welcoming to new patrons. Don't even bother touching the juke box, the owner will skip your songs if she doesn't like them, even if there is not another person in the bar.."}
{"text":"this place has the rudest customer service ever! the owner is so unprofessional and shouldnt work in an industry that involves customers or food. this establishment should be shut down!"}
{"text":"Ice cold beers and a smoke! Good fish fry. Cool dive bar with great service!"}
{"text":"Will not return 
Rude uncomfortable atmosphere 
After 20 minutes with no service left"}
{"text":"This bar/restaurant is wonderful! I have met the nicest and most interesting people here. The food is awesome and reasonably priced. It is a down home atmosphere that will keep me coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Bartenders and servers are really great. 
Casual atmosphere, food is cheap, good fish fry. 
I'd recommend"}
{"text":"Definitely a dive bar. So if you want atmosphere, go elsewhere.  the food is the best sports bar food in Phoenix.  Try the steak quesadilla ..."}
{"text":"Wasn't the worst place I've been too but it still has it's negative points.  Took a little bit for someone to recognize we were even there and than the waitress was slow.  The waitress than left and went home with out letting us know so that just seems weird to me.  35$ for two meals and two beers seems pretty steep.  Oh and the bathroom were mote than unpleasant with the graffiti and the paint falling apart.

The food was pretty good but not for the price I paid. All in all I'll just say cleanliness goes a long way."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with a friend and the service was average..  I however did not care for the decor on the walls.. (dead animals, etc..) nor the hunting on tv.  Other than that, the staff was friendly and our bartender Jason was really nice..  So if you are okay with animals on walls then I would recommend this place to you.  Average service, nice place to drop in and have a cheap beverage."}
{"text":"***Extremely Disappointed*** After researching to find a good Friday Night Fish Fry I saw tons of great ratings online about this place and decided to make the half hour trip to try it.  Have to say we have tried a LOT of fish fry and this was by far the worst we have EVER had.  If it was fresh it did not taste like it.  We ate a few bites, payed the check and left.  I'm sorry but I won't be back.  On top of the that the bar smelled horrible and my shoes stuck to the floor.  Gross!!!!!"}
{"text":"For folks from the Midwest who miss their fish frys and great small town taverns this is the place to go.  It has none of the chi chi foo foo restaurant atmosphere - it is definitely a sports bar.  It is about great food and fun and friends.  The fried food is available every day of the week so you don't have to wait til Friday but if you want all you can eat, Friday is the day to go.  But expect to wait!   Prices are reasonable.  The Walleye Pike fish fry is expensive but worth it.   The beer is plentiful and the wait staff is friendly.  Go tip a few!"}
{"text":"Good for what it is.  Divey, local atmosphere.The food has been really good. Again, in the context of a dive bar. The fish is prepared well, the fries come out hot and the beer comes out cold.  Paper plates and plastic baskets are no problem for me. Wait staff has always been friendly even when busy. Good for lunch or dinner with friends who just want to hang. Parking lot is smallish but it's usually not a problem to find a space close by.  It is dark inside. Very dark. And, as everyone notes, there are animal heads/ stuffed birds everywhere. Really, I mean everywhere. ( Add a star if you're an aspiring taxidermist. )"}
{"text":"I was here on New Year's Eve for lunch. This place is a dive bar with some residual stank left over from the days when smoking was permitted. There's an unfinished ceiling with exposed painted black rafters and numerous stuffed animal trophies hanging around. Frankly, there are so many that it's a little creepy. 

But the beer was cold and the burger was fresh so if I'm in the area I'd bite the bullet and do it again."}
{"text":"Saturday we where out running errands and got hungry. Well the typical fast food wasn't going to do. We saw the sign and loved the 6am cocktails and needed to try this place. We hit the door and Jess was running the room and taking control of a chaotic room. She pulled it all together and made it work. The food was great and well priced and good size portions. We will definitely be back and have found our new spot on this side of town."}
{"text":"Friday night fish fry!  Fish is very fresh and delicious I especially like their fish tacos but beware their chipotle sauce is very, very hot.  If you are hot sensitive get it on the side.  Good salads too.  I always drink iced tea theirs is terrible get a soda."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Liked the food enough the first time to come back. 

Atmosphere: It's your basic dive bar. Dimly lit. Mix of tables and booths. Lots of wildlife on the walls. A few tv's. A small patio. That said, being a dive bar isn't necessarily a negative thing. I like dive bars. It looks like a good place to stop for a drink, some food or to watch a game.

Food: I ordered the Fajita Salad both times I went. It's delicious! Sliced, grilled chicken along with sauteed green peppers and onions served on a mix of lettuce, red cabbage, carrot and tomato. It comes with jalapeno ranch dressing and a huge folded over tortilla. The tortilla tastes homemade. My friend ordered the Alaskan Pollack the first time, and a bacon cheeseburger the second. He liked both!

Service: Not great. Not terrible. Different person waited on us each time. They were polite, but not friendly or welcoming. On the second visit, the server walked away abruptly without asking what side my friend wanted with his burger. We had to call her back over to finish the order.

I'll give it three stars. I'll probably go back again for the Fajita Salad, but if they really want repeat business, they need to work with their staff on customer service skills."}
{"text":"The BEST walleye and other fish in town. The fish is not covered with thick, greasy batter. It is wonderful, BUT I HATE THE NEW THICK CUT SOGGY FRENCH FRIES.. I have thought of bringing my own thin fries!!!"}
{"text":"What a shame - The place has totally hit rock bottom.  We live right down the block and used to come here often for a bite and a drink but never again!
Our most recent visit, a Rancid smell from a combo of stale beer and dirty grease traps punched us in the face as we opened the door. Next, we were served a bottle of beer with the label falling off cause it had been sitting in water for months - tasted skunked and a glass of red wine that had turned to vinegar!
Our Corned beef was tough and burger was bland. Didn't even bother with the burnt fries.
Bartender/Server was nice but, place was empty and we barely got checked on.
Sad to say, another place that had so much promise has fallin' into the pit of restaurant neglect!"}
{"text":"The place is full of dead animals and dead staff. The staff is rude, gossipy and the set their drink prices on if they like you or not!! The food is greasy and disgusting and the place stinks like the oil hasn't been changed in years."}
{"text":"Definitely a dive bar. Food is good. Service is pretty good. Drinks are decent. I hope you like dead animals on the walls. They are all over the place. Friends rave abt the Friday fish fry. I don't eat sea food. So, idk, but I trust them."}
{"text":"Great food, but poor moral character. I just paid $15.95 for what was supposed to be 10oz of walleye. What I got was about 4oz of walleye. I pointed this out to the waitress and she agreed, but said there was nothing she could do. The cook told me in Spanglish that it was ten ounces and then laughed knowingly about it as if it were a joke. There was no manager to be found.

The other Q has changed over the years. The service and quality has dropped significantly, but outright misrepresentation and poor scruples are just unnacceptable. We went on a Saturday night about 6:30PM and it was very slow. I know why now.I will tell my friends and hopefully they are even slower from now on."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Q since I was 5 years old. I practiced gymnastics in the gym behind the Q and went there after practice for dinner with my dad for years. It was convenient, delicious, and the bartenders all knew us by name and always had my dads drink ready. I decided to revisit last night, I am now 22 so I wanted to have my first ever, dirty Shirley. I was looking forward to sharing my history with our waitress. We arrived and took a seat in a booth. Our waitress approached the table and asked us what we wanted to drink. We wanted beer so she asked us for our IDs, and my dad told her he didn't have his on him. She snapped back and said well there's no way I'm serving you without an ID, when he was clearly the oldest one at the table. FYI, anyone that looks under 30 is who you're lawfully supposed to card. If you're going to deny service to someone that is clearly over 30 your tip is going to be crap. Strike one lady. Our food didn't take long but both the fried fish and fries were almost cold and hard as if they had been sitting out. Definitely not fresh out of the fryer. My number one pet peeve is hot food coming out cold. Especially fish!!!! We asked for hot fries because ours were stone cold and then she charged me for the extra basket!!! You don't charge people extra because your food when out cold !!! What kind of customer service is that??? Strike 2 lady!! My boyfriend asked for water and she brought him a Dr. Pepper, so of course he drank it, God forbid we ask for anything else. She notices during our visit his drink is empty, and asks him to refill it, so he kindly said well I asked for water and you brought me this... She blamed it on the table next to her and laughed at herself as if she was trying to redeem herself. Strike 3!! The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because I know I could have a better experience with a different waitress. It was all her fault my experience sucked. I'll make sure to stay clear of her when I go there. I've never met a server so bitter and rude before. Good attitude, attentiveness, and care get you great tips in the service industry. I would know because I am a server now !!! This chick was not happy getting $2 on a $60 tab. I didn't have to heart to completely stiff her but I hope she thinks twice and tries a little harder to please her guests. Maybe her tips will improve!"}
{"text":"This is a great little cozy place with genuine atmosphere in a neighborhood watering hole way, and terrific food if you like memorable bar food. It's fun, it's cheap, and it's the way things used to be a whole lot more than they are now."}
{"text":"We usually get treated well by a young lady named TJ but tonight we had a different girl. I had a chocolate cake shot which is typically frangelico and vodka with a sugar rim and slice of lemon and I was introduced to this shot at this bar, but tonight this six dollar shot tasted like lemon water. What a rip. If we get this bleach blonde chinless waitress again you can bet the only thing I order is water because that's all she brings. Boyfriend had a couple shots (really small and funny tasting so we're thinking they were also watered down) and I also had a soda and rum which tasted only like soda."}
{"text":"I came here with a girlfriend because we always saw plenty of cars in the parking lot which, to me, indicates a decent restaurant.  
Upon walking in, the restaurant was empty but there is an outdoor seating area for smokers which was packed.  As an ex-smoker, I think this area would be highly appreciated by smokers just to have a place to eat, drink, sit and relax without having to exit to smoke.
I decided to sit inside.  Service was very friendly but the inside smelled like the grease-trap of a restaurant.  I ordered a burger and fries and both were just mediocre.  This is close to home but I will not return."}
{"text":"Service was great.
Food was pretty good but not for the price. 
Price was outrageous.
Plenty of seating. 
Will not be back because of price."}
{"text":"Agree that the prices a The Other Q Bar and Grill in North Phoenix are outrageous but the food is good. They make a good Philly Cheese Steak - that is if you can actually get them to give you the correct order. 

I haven't been back since I ordered a cheese steak and they gave me a fish platter for $15.00! When I told them, they told me they did not take an order for a cheese steak this evening. Really?! So they just brushed me off with a careless attitude. These guys behind the counter are apparently partying with the clients and are easily confused and very rude. 

Sad, you seem to be loosing clients left and right, but also seems like you don't care. With this attitude and service, I'm pretty reluctant to eat the food there now. I've seen just how dirty the servers can be at bar restaurants and when you have such a poor \"I don't care\" attitude, bleech! no thanks... too scary to eat from there.

And you still owe me $15.00!"}
{"text":"If you are a high brow, spoiled yuppie go somewhere else. If you enjoy authentic, real, good ole boy atmosphere, this is the spot. Ask about the walrus part hangin over the bar....lol"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to the Q in a few years. We went to the fish fry tonight (2/24). WOW, the price went way up and we through the quality went down.   The fish was dry and flavor wasnt very good.   I dont think we will go back for fish their ever."}
{"text":"dark and gloomy, this bar had a bunch of old drunks and meth heads in it.....  TERRIBLE"}
{"text":"No more all you can eat Catfish!  Who ever is responsible for the menu change, you destroyed what was special about the Q.  I won't be back - see ya!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this bar is the staff... they are super friendly and nice. We had great service from them all when we went yesterday. The food was okay, but it was a little slow coming out. I ordered the mini taco's and they came with salsa and a spicy ranch type sauce; very tasty bar food. A friend told me the fish and chips they serve is usually pretty good as well; not too much batter... so that's next on my list to try."}
{"text":"Seriously? I order a drink and the waitress wants me 2 finish my 1st drink so she doesn't have to make my 2nd and give me a clean glass? Alrighty Then!"}
{"text":"I work within walking distance of this place and after several years finally checked it out for lunch. They were busy and I  waited for 10 minutes before being recognized. Once the bartender/waitress came to take my order all was good. The staff I interfaced with were very nice.

I've  been told the fish fry was quite good so I ordered that. Within a few short minutes my lunch was brought to the table. The fish was a very good quality and the breading was pretty good. The coleslaw was good and the frys were just frys, nothing to brag about but quite edible. Since I was going back to the office I just had ice tea. It was freshly made and good. 

There are several televisions, enough for a sports junkie. There were a lot of dead animals on the wall, so Bambi lovers may not like the decor. I could almost imagine that I was in a bar up the in the mountains of northern Arizona. 

This is a place worth returning to."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time tonight looking for a new neighborhood bar. I'd strongly suggest only coming here if you are looking for cheap drinks & good coleslaw. I would not recommend eating the food, unless you haven't eaten in days. I really don't know how anyone could have an appetite when the first thing you smell when you walk in the door is dust with a hint of fryer grease. But we decided to order food anyway, against our better judgement. The appetizer of onion rings and fried mushrooms were not just a huge disappointment but the most disgusting thing I'd ever eaten. I'm not sure if it was a dirty fryer but the mushrooms especially tasted really gross, like they had gone bad. We couldn't eat anymore after the first bite. When our main dishes came out the food runner asked if we needed anything else in which my husband replied \"Some more drinks please, if you could send our server back over\". Ten minutes later our server came to our table with the same disappointing beers we ordered previously. Instead of coming back to ask us what we wanted, she just assumed we wanted the same thing. Our main entrees were OK. The one thing that made them just \"OK\" and not \"bad\" was the coleslaw they put on top, it was really good. And made our sandwiches probably taste better than they would have without it.......so this joint is getting 2 stars instead of 1 for good coleslaw & cheap beer!!!"}
{"text":"Q is a local dive type bar and grill in North Phoenix. With that being said there are not too many N. PHX places to eat lunch. I have been here several times and usually enjoy the food. Today Not as much. 

I elected to go with the burger and frys. I wanted something not fast foodish and a real piece of meat. Nope, it was almost as bad as fast food. Sonic... yeah, it was a Sonic burger. 

i will stick to tthe fish."}
{"text":"A great place. Dark, divey bar with great staff and food, and lots of stuffed animals all over the walls. Try the all-you-can-eat Friday fish-fry!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here last night. Craft beer by the pitcher! Had the Calamari, it was delicious. Service was good too. Ambiance was cool but the place could use some cleaning (bathrooms). Decent menu for bar food."}
{"text":"1 star is being kind. Bar tender was very rude acted extremely inconvenienced to simply take our drink order. After sitting over 20 minutes waiting for her to return to take our food order whilst listening to her complain to regulars at the bar we simply paid our drink tab and left. Will not return, do not recommend."}
{"text":"after reading all of these reviews, we decided to give it a try, thinking we'd either love it or hate it.
We loved it!
We were greeted by our friendly waitress within minutes. She took our order for drinks and all-you-can-eat fish fry & returned in a heartbeat, first with the drinks, followed closely by our fish dinners.
My husband said quietly to me, \"that's funny. i thought that the negative reviews that you read me mentioned the wait staff being rude.  That actually couldn't be further from the truth!\" I agreed with him. She was especially nice & attentive and quick!
The food was good to great. The portions were very large, and she took it upon herself to reorder fish for us before we even had to ask for it.
I loved the fact that the fish was served with a large cup of tarter and a large cup of cocktail sauce. You usually don't get cocktail sauce & I prefer it. And the cocktail sauce was especially good! It had a nice horseradish kick that made me wonder if it was homemade.
The only things I didn't LOVE:
1.)well, the taxidermy extravaganza was a little much, but i come from a family of trappers and hunters. it wasn't a deal-breaker, put it that way.
2.)the iced tea was instant -but when the waitress asked if i wanted a refill, i asked if they had dr.pepper and she brought me a mr.pibb right away -and didn't charge me for the second beverage. 
3.)the price was a little high. but, i thought that the service and, well the cocktail sauce, made it worth it.
We absolutely will return & we would definitely recommend it to anyone.
(p.s. i am not an employee and i don't know anybody affiliated with this business)"}
{"text":"So we are regulars at the other q bar location. Today we tried this location and I had the worst dining experience ever. There were three staff members and we were the only ones in there. There was a gal named Tiffany who was complaining about how she hates all the staff and dropping f bombs and cussing the whole time. She barely acknowledged us and when she did she never stopped gossiping about the staff. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"We absolutely love The Other Q Bar.   It has a Unique atmosphere that seems to just fit for a family and then also for adult times...and it has a super friendly staff-you walk in and are treated like a regular. The food is fantastic! Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner.  Some of our favs are the Julie's chicken sandwich, New Yorker, Wings, Fajita salad, Laura's buffalo wrap... I could go on and on! Have a dietary request... They will accommodate. Try it out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A typical dive bar, cheap and easy. The drinks were good and decently priced. Not really anything that made this place stand out to me, if in the area I would go again."}
{"text":"First off, this place is a dive, and I mean a DIVE.

Every animal is on the wall here. 

Their beer selection is abysmal, even for a dive bar....really, what kind of dive bar doesn't carry PBR?

I had the fish, it was nothing special, the fries tasted like frozen fries, nothing special there either.

I guess for a bar, it would work, but it's definitely not for my type."}
{"text":"Hang on to your lug nuts because this dive is in need of an overhaul.  The interior is dark, dingy, if Ryan Lochte had done some decorating.  The bartender does double-duty as a server , taking food/drink orders at the tables. (Service started out slow and then fizzled out altogether after about 10 minutes)
   Found myself at the bar between a pair of heavy-duty trenchermen to my left (wolfing down an order of nachos with extra meat sauce)  and a group of hollow-eyed heavy drinkers on the right. Ordered a glass of merlot...don't have that spirit here...double shots of whiskey next time!
   Wont be back. Good luck if you decide to visit! (Bring your hazmat equipment!)"}
{"text":"What a great little bar, the owner was a super nice guy and the drinks are super cheap.  The inside is way nicer than I thought it would be.  Its very manly with all the animal heads everywhere but its very clean and just a great little place to meet some friends for a drink.  It wasn't busy when I stopped by but it was around noon to meet a friend.  I would say it is average in size and the service was great too."}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago for their fish fry. I was here once before for breakfast and found myself disappointed. I should have known better than to get this place a second chance. The fish tasted horrible and some of it smelled like ammonia. They took the price of one of the three meal off the bill but I could still smell the ammonia from the fish they were still serving. There is no reason to ever come back to this place."}
{"text":"Ok so if I had judged a book by its cover I would have walked out, it's small and divey, kinda dark with dead animal heads all over the walls. The bathrooms need updating but they were clean. The waitress was really nice and stayed up on our drinks and needs. The food was really good. I ordered the philly steak. It's close to my work which is good because the food and service were worth coming back for."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I have been several times, always on a Tuesday to take advantage of their Taco Tuesday special. It's 3 tacos for $5 your choice of pork, fish or chicken (mix and match) My personal favorite is the fish.  They serve you your tacos in corn tortillas with cheese melted on top, then it's off to the taco bar! Yup, you get to dress up your own tacos however your heart desires.  The taco bar includes lettuce, cabbage, cilantro, diced tomatoes, green sauce and their baja sauce (delicious but very spicy!)  You can't beat this deal... especially when you pair them with some of their ICEY (and I mean ICEY!) cold beer, which is served by the glass or pitcher.

The last time we went my husband was not in the mood for tacos so he opted for their bison burger (added blue cheese crumbles and bacon) and it was delish!  Our server, Pam, was a delight.  She was very personable, very funny and made us feel at home.  

There are plenty of televisions inside as well as a pool table. Seating includes booths, high tops and the bar top inside.  Outside on their full service, smoking patio (which is air conditioned!!!) there is a second bar as well as at least 10 more hightops.  I believe there are also 2 more TV's outside behind the bar. 

And to those who feel the need to comment on the decor and refer to it as a dive, you need to hop in your car and head about 15 miles east. it's a place called Scottsdale... you can enjoy the company of your fellow douche bags there."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong eating at the other Q. This is one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix. They open at 6:00 am which is great for me when I have a gap in my morning schedule. The breakfasts are hardy with big portions. My favorite is the green chile plate, WOW! Excellent green chile, eggs cooked to perfection by José, comes with potatoes, tortilla and condiments. One of my other favorites is the Ruben sandwich with corned beef. In my opinion it is the BEST Ruben in Phoenix. Trust me I've tried a lot. I recently tried the seafood platter. It was great but, I'm not a big calamari fan I'd rather have scallops and it could use some sides like the fish n chips. The fish is always fresh and delicious. What ever you order you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised, had not been to this place since the AZ state smoking ban and it has fully recovered.  Still a smoking patio but no effects of this inside.  Baja style burrito was VERY good although it was called \"fish tacos\" it was an A as far as burritos go.  Will be back."}
{"text":"It's a bar. It's dark, there are dead animals all over the wall and all most all of the food is fried.  I have never been terribly impressed with the food, but its cheap, as is the beer, which is what really matters right?  The service is... adequate.  Most importantly I can ride my bike here, so that's pretty much why I come."}
{"text":"Lack of service.  That's why the 2 stars.  The place is pretty cool inside.  I really like the big game trophies all around the wall.  What I didn't like was the service.  Menu looked promising.  Too bad I never ordered due to the waitress/bartender not coming around.  I may or may not try this place again. I doubt it.  There's so many other places that I'd rather be ignored at."}
{"text":"Yes, it is a dive bar.  Yes, there are animal heads on the wall.  But the staff is great and they serve an awesome grilled pastrami panini (the New Yorker).  The prices are very reasonable, the fish fry has a huge following, and who could ask for more than a climate controlled smoking patio?  Give it a chance!"}
{"text":"I've rarely seen such weak reviews of any restaurant/bar as for The Other Q Bar and Grill.  The theme here has one person after another ranting about it being a dive, the stuffed animal heads and even the construction of the ceiling.  What about the FOOD people?  Did your Mercedes' GPS screw up again so you lost your way to Scottsdale and ended up here and had no idea why so you can only complain that it doesn't look like Mastro's?  Guess what?  It doesn't taste like Mastro's either!  The food here is actually good and doesn't come out of a microwave.  Somebody forced you to look at stuffed animal heads, you say?  People!  Do you have any idea what I'm forced to look at when I go to Olive Garden ... which is like never.

Get over yourselves.  We were there for a few hours and none of us could find one hint that The Other Q Bar and Grill is trying to pretend they are not a dive.  They are a dive and a GREAT one at that.  Most of us had the Friday fish fry and the (former) Buffalonians in the group were impressed how well it compared to the Queen City of the Great Lakes.  Prices are reasonable; the service we received was fantastic (our waitress thanked us several times for making her laugh).  AND, they play both types of music!

Seriously, if you are turned off by stuffed animal heads on the wall; think for a moment that THEY have no choice all day but to look at YOU!  Now that is a revolting thought ..."}
{"text":"if you like poor service and 20 min wait times for a simple bottled domestic beer then this is your place. waitress is more interested in her phone than taking care of customers. I tip very well and thought I would leave a huge tip so I would get better service next time.. nope.. same ol thing.. food is hit and miss sometimes its sbove average and 70 percent of the time its average to poor."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since they opened and the food & service have been consistently excellent throughout the years. It's a nice little neighborhood bar that we travel 25 miles to get to when we come. 

My Minnesota friends say this bar is typical of Minnesota - relatively dark inside with lots of dead animals on the walls. Being vegetarian I tune out the animals and focus on what I like best - the rest of the experience. 

My husband is a huge fan of the Friday all-you-can-eat night fish fry. He also loves the fried mini taco's as an appetizer. I don't eat any type of meat so I stick with grilled cheese (pepper jack on rye) and friend zucchini, which is always fantastic. Surprisingly, the salsa here is amazing, even better than many Mexican restaurants. 

The service is the best - fast & friendly and they always know how to take care of you whether you're a party of 1 or a group picky group of 8. 

There is an indoor (non-smoking) dining area and bar as well as an outside bar and seating area that allows smoking. They have done a wonderful job with the outside bar, which is fully covered, has climate control and great seating. Even on a chilly rainy evening November you will be comfortable out here. 

Pros:
Fast & friendly service
Fresh fish
Menu selection with healthy options
Salsa! (who would have thought?)
Drinks made right
Ice cold beer
Fun atmosphere
Inside & outside seating/bar
Clean inside & out

Cons:
Because of all the pros, parking can be crazy on a Friday night, this place fills up fast!"}
{"text":"I've only been here on Fridays for the AYCE fish fry when I have a craving. I think it's walleye or Alaska pollock with french fries and coleslaw. During the summer, it's not too crowded. But when the snowbirds are here, the wait could be about 45 mins to 1 hour. The fish is the best I've had in the greater metropolitan Phoenix. At other places, the fish seem to be heavily breaded. You can tell by looking at the pictures. If the fish is flat and smooth, it would appear that they use too much breading around the fish. Q Bar fish seem to be thick and lightly breaded. I appreciate that. You can actually see the fish. At other places, I would have to pull the breading off and the fish is so small."}
{"text":"Holy grail of hole in the wall bars. Great place with awesome service and EXCELLENT food I have eaten here twice, and both times been pleasantly surprised at how great the food was. The Q burger is one of, if not the best burgers I've ever had.  Also, I asked for crispy fries and they were actually crispy!! Compliments to the chefs!! Great great place."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch on the my friend and I's Burger Tour of Phoenix.  I actually regret it.  The food was not great.  I got the Q Burger which comes with green chili and swiss.  I thought it sounded good but NOPE.  The green chili was really dry and unflavorful.  The onions overpowered the green chili which was a major problem.  The fries tasted like they were frozen in a bag then fried.  

For just drinks maybe you can go here on a budget and I guess have fun but I would say you would have to be a redneck to do that.  They have dead animals all over and on tv there was tractor pulls on."}
{"text":"I was at patio bar and the blonde that was outside bar looked miserable! 
She sat in a chair and seemed so unhappy! I was here over an hour and she never smiled once. When she was asked for a drink she looked like it was a chore to make it! 
You would think a smoking patio would be a plus but not with the server you have."}
{"text":"Definitely smells like fish in here.  And tons of mooseheads and other dead animals on the wall.  But walk outside to the patio and it's not only a much better smell but it's a more fun environment.  They even have A/C and heat out there.  TVs, bar, etc.  More fun atmosphere.  Fridays are packed and Saturday nights are slow.  A fun dive if worth stopping by if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great food and the waitress was perfect. Our drinks were always full and she was very sweet. It was a very nice and laid back  atmosphere. 

I ordered the fajita salad and loved it. My boyfriend got the jumbo shrimp and said it was fantastic. Our friends had eaten there the night before as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love going here because they have an outside bar! Wish more places had an outside place to eat and drink"}
