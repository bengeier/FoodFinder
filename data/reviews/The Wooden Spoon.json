{"text":"Pretty good

We had the calamari and artichoke appetizer, which was good and a very generous serving. Popcorn shrimp wasn't all breading, which is a win in my book. Hush puppies had more onion than I like, but they were good, too. Bill had the broiled grouper, which he said was fine, but I thought it was a bit underdone. Apple pie for dessert was very good. Oh, and Donna, our waitress, was a hoot. She was great!"}
{"text":"Was familiar with the restaurant when we noticed it had changed we wanted to give it a try.  The Yelp hours are unfortunately incorrect as they don't open until 7:00am (shows 6:30), but we were ok with waiting a few minutes.  We were seated quickly and the food also got to the table fast.  I had the Unusual omelette with grits and they were both very good.  I'd definitely go back again for their breakfast, and I look forward to trying their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Not good. The first time we came here was for dinner, and we ended up leaving because nothing sounded very appetizing. If I wanted to spend $22 on a steak, I would go to a steakhouse. We wanted to give it another chance for breakfast this time. Got the combo breakfast and it just was not very good. Waited 45 minutes for not very good food, service was ok, nothing to write home about. I will not be coming here again, I would rather travel to uptown and go to Midnight Diner or Original Pancake House any day."}
{"text":"great service our waitress was so nice.,  Oredered the crab,spinach dip, it was swimming in water ans inedible,returned it ( only to notice it wasnt taken off the bill when we got home) Ribeye steak was so thin and fatty over done, shrimp skewers were very good , But this place is not cheap not worth the money, Im shocked they didnt remove the price 9.50 for the bad dip,"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, So good! Clean, Salmon had good flavor but a little too done, but still good, husband grouper was awesome, potato chips-awesome homemade"}
{"text":"The nastiest food I have ever eaten at a restaurant! I was shocked at how horrible it was. I could not eat more than two bites. They will not be open long with food like that. Our server was nice. There were only two tables there at prime dinner time during concord mills and I now see why..."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast around 8 am and the place was empty, even with the lack of customers the server still screwed up our order, though she made it right with free bacon.  I heard good things about the biscuits so biscuits smothered in sausage gravy sounded good to me.  Served with eggs and your choice of bacon or sausage patties I opted for the patties.  Biscuit was large and fluffy, great overall texture and flavor but the gravy left little to be desired with very slight traces of actual sausage. Speaking of sausage, I am not sure what they are trying to pull of at the spoon but those patties did not resemble any pork product I am familiar with!  50 bucks spent between the 4 of us so it ain't cheap!

{"text":"Warmly greeted and professionally served at Wooden Spoon during my first visit for breakfast on a sleepy Tuesday morning. The place is freshly remodeled after the owners jettisoned their relationship with the Mayflower seafood franchise.  They wanted more control of the menu and opted for family style, country cooking.

Will it work?  Time will tell.  Unlike some of their competition in more established (and less costly) neighborhoods, this is a high rent district; therefore, the overhead reflects in the price.  My eggs were cooked to order,  the grits homemade, and the biscuit satisfactorily southern.  They promote thick-slab bacon so I was disappointed when it arrived on the scrawny side.  Maybe this little piggy was on a paleo diet before he went to market.

My server, Sheila, is a consummate professional being a hold over from the Mayflower days.  I received great service, a constant flow of Joe, and a welcoming spirit.  I like that.  Thanks!

When near the mall, I say, \"Give 'em a whirl!\"  Let's support local, homegrown business ventures."}
{"text":"Horrible service and very bland food. This visit made me wish I just stayed home and made my own breakfast. I could have let my 5 year old cook and it would have tasted much better than this. Server came to the table only 2 times, once to take our drink orders and food order then to give us the check. The pancakes were horrible! How can you ruin pancakes ?!!?? The eggs could have been made with at least a shake of salt. The cheese were very mild couldn't tell if the eggs had any cheese in it. My husband had steak and eggs and it was super  bland. The water and quality of biscuits  were the only thing good about his place. Famous toastery is close by, save yourself the agony for breakfast."}
{"text":"This five star rating is for our wonderful server, Amber. She was the best!  Enthusiastic, energetic, and friendly. She made our day!"}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner for the first time and the food was great! The location is convenient, large space, big selection on the menu and open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 

Would recommend this restaurant to anyone, the staff was friendly and restaurant was clean, will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"First visit and generally good with some improvements needed on Menu

This was my first visit at this restaurant although I had eaten here several times when this was a Mayflower Seafood Restaurant.

It was a cold wet deary Saturday when we stopped by just after noon. Not a large crowd and warm and cozy.

We were promptly seated and our server Amber was there shortly to take beverage orders and present us with menus. Very efficient server.

Looking over the menu, my wife ordered the Turkey Burger with Corn and Fried Okra as sides.

As for myself, I had the Carolina Popcorn Shrimp with came with Hush puppies and Cole Slaw and for my choice of side, I ordered Fried Okra as well.

My wife enjoyed her Turkey Burger and found it to be nice and moist and very flavorful. The Okra and Corn on the other hand were only luke warm at best.

In my case, the Carolina Popcorn Shrimp were outstanding and made the meal. Good thing because the hush puppies were doughy, the Okra undercooked and the reason I don't normally order Cole Slaw is that it tend to sit around for a lengthily time and the cabbage juice seeps out and mixes with the mayo to form a soupy mess.  Had hoped for better but what I got was typical Cole Slaw.

That said, as I indicated, the Carolina Popcorn Shrimp was what made the meal and I could have foregone the the rest with no loss.

Restaurant is nice and clean with fresh lines and themes from the remodel. Looks great and very refreshing.

I will be back because there are other items on the menu I want to try now that I know what to avoid."}
{"text":"My Greek omelet was fantastic ! The flavors of the spinach, feta and super sweet tomatoes were fabulous. The fruit fresh and crisp . The biscuits fluffy and tasty. Coffee fresh and hot . The eggs over easy perfect.. We'll come back"}
{"text":"I might have caught them on a bad night, but the Turkey dinner was cold as well as the Mac and cheese. I even told the girl and asked for a box so I could bring it home and heat it up to the right temp. No reaction.
I'll come back and give them another shot after Thanksgiving, if they last that long."}
{"text":"We got out of church and decided to spend a family breakfast together. We arrived to the restaurant around 11:20 am and we got seated immediately. Once we got seated, no one approached us to take our drinks or even acknowledge us. It was not busy and their were few waitresses passing us by. After 10 minutes I got up to the hostess and asked who is waiting on us, as no one has come to our table yet? She went to go get our waitress but never heard from the hostess or the waitress. After 5-7 minutes we left. This was one of our favorite places to eat but no longer will we be coming back. Bad service and no apologies from the hostess."}
{"text":"Catfish strips and popcorn shrimp were good; the ribeye- not so much. Definitely not a steak worth $22.  Steak was cooked correctly, just thin and very fatty."}
{"text":"First time here and I can say I am thoroughly satisfied by the food....the service? Not so much. Good portion control by the chef so I'm full but not overly stuffed. My pancake was fluffy, and coupled with their warm maple syrup, left a great after taste when I started munching on their savory home fries. The country fried steak had an amazingly thick, creamy sausage gravy coating. The French toast was good but the strawberries were a waste of $2.50. I would come back but I'm not sure if I would recommend this place to a friend as somewhere they HAD to go."}
{"text":"No, no, no.... Same owner as the Mayflower which was the previous business, and the entrees are as bland as the old place.

 Sometimes ya just need to move along, sell the place and try knitting. 

All the sides were not hot, or warm even. After asking the waiter for a preferred entree he recommended the baked spaghetti... What a mistake that was! The sauce was full of paprika, with melted cheese sitting atop a bowl full of barely warmed noodles. Nothing baked about it whatsoever. The wife's salad was limp at best. So glad I went, cause I won't be going back. 

The Wooden Spoon... with no handle!!"}
{"text":"One star for the server, one star for the homemade chips. Everything else was either bland or bad. The crab dip appetizer was plain served with hard and mangled tortilla chips. The fish sandwich I had was \"ok\"...kinda tasteless. My wife's Cobb salad came with chicken tenders. I agree with a previous reviewer, this place has no identity with souless food, and will not make it."}
{"text":"This building used to be a seafood place - the Mayflower if memory serves. While the outside really hasn't changed much, if at all, the inside has undergone a solid renovation, like they were on Fixer Upper, and now looks really nice.

They are ver welcoming on arrival, and you pass a couple barrels or beans (not really sure their purpose - there is no wooden spoon within) prior to being seated.

The menu is interesting though doesn't quite fit the building's insides. Food looks good but doesn't taste great - if Bob Uecker were here it would be a one sided argument, but it could be opening jitters since they are new."}
{"text":"We just happened to be looking for a breakfast place while traveling, and we were very fortunate to have found The Wooden Spoon. I'm not usually very adventurous when it comes to trying new restaurants, but this worked out really well. 

I had an omelette and home fries, both of which were incredible. My wife raved about the french toast. Our server was friendly, polite, professional, and efficient. The restaurant was clean, and parking was plentiful. Overall, this was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"No complaints - staff was courteous, menu had quite a few options for breakfast and lunch, decor was a little rustic, waitress was attentive. Food was good. No complaints but nothing that really 'wow'ed me. It's def worth checking out."}
{"text":"First time here. Newly opened. 

Small menu, but everything we had was good. 

Didn't go in expecting a 5 star meal. Got exactly what we expected, which is good food at a good price, with good service.


We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very tasty breakfast! Sunday at 1pm, plenty of seating and we were severed promptly. I had the \"petite breakfast\", 2 eggs, 2 sausage patties, fruit, and a pancake. Scrambled eggs were fine, everything else was good! Definitely recommend for a solid, reasonably-priced breakfast."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Wooden Spoon several times now along with my extended family.  All in all, it is a solid option for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  My six year old destroys their popcorn shrimp platter every time.  I normally do not like fried foods because of blandness or over breading, but the Wooden Spoon does it right.  The ratio of bread to food is perfect and it tastes good!  Much better than the fried food the Mayflower served.  They even make their own ranch for dipping.  It is well balanced and delicious.  The portion sizes are large enough to share and the prices are right.  We have only encountered one bad entree in all of our visits and that was the ribs my dad ordered.  He and several other patrons actually sent them back that night.  We totally think that was a one off occurrence because everything else has always been great.  They currently have coupons through Valpak so now is the time to try them if you have been waiting.  The Wooden Spoon is a welcomed addition to the Concord Mills dining scene for sure!"}
{"text":"Yea, just OK. Menu was kinda underwhelming but I got the beef tips that were on special. They were ok but serving size was small. You get two sides with your meat order so i got a bakes potato which is just that no more no less. Had to ask for sour cream to go along with butter. The most disappointing thing was the Mac n Cheese. It was pretty much like Kraft instant out of the box... Not baked, not slow cooked and creamy just instant Mac and cheese. Service was great though if not over zealous as were constantly asked if everything was OK and if we needed refills. I won't hold that against them at all but food selection, quantity and especially quality need to be stepped up."}
{"text":"The Wooden Spoon is a brand new restaurant in the Concord area, they have taken over the space that used to be the Mayflower. 

I stopped by for lunch since today was the grand opening. Well here's the update; it's the same owners and the food is still good but the menu has changed dramatically! They have a nice selection of  Chicken, Pasta, Beef, Pork and yes they still have Seafood which by the way is delicious! 

Carla is still here to get things running smooth, and the staff is still friendly and attentive! 

FYI they still have a dedicated take out walk-in kitchen"}
{"text":"Very friendly hostess and seated quickly and pleasantly. That usually is a good indication to me of the experience to come. Menu looked really good. Had the omelet w/ cheese and sausage. Was okay. The home fried potatoes weren't bad, not great. Nothing was really hot, for as fast as we seemed to get our food, I was hoping for a little more. The service was quick and drinks refilled promptly. Not sure that there was much to write about. They need to do something or tout some signature items to distinguish themselves as a legit place for breakfast or lunch over the slew of national chain restaurants."}
{"text":"This is the first review I have ever done without actually eating the food. We went on a Wednesday evening around 6:30. There were only 6 cars in the parking lot. We were greeted at the door and seated. The first this we noticed was the lack of customers. The next was the menu. When you hear \"The Wooden Spoon\" you think good old country cooking. There was nothing on the menu that look remotely good. What they did have was a price structure that did not make sense. Way too pricey for what they offered. I am going to predict that they will not last 6 months unless they make changes. (I hope I'm wrong). Good luck."}
{"text":"Cajun Pasta is the bomb!
Spicy and tasty. 
Service is great."}
{"text":"Private parking lot 
Take out area
New renovations are very pretty with the addition of TVs
New country food concept, serving breakfast, not based around seafood.
Some of the Mayflower employees are still there.  
My waitress and others used \"sweetie\" a lil too much while communicating.
Fried shrimp (hot out the fryer), waffle fries (cold), hush puppies (thick batter, not good)
I would probably go back to try something different, but will miss the old Mayflower."}
