{"text":"Very friendly hard working staff serving good Chinese food. Decent selection for lunch and bigger portions for dinner. They have many take out customers."}
{"text":"Solidly good but not great Chinese food.   I probably get take-out from here about a dozen times a year. I always order fried dumplings & whatever else strikes my fancy, which tonight was Shrimp Lo Mein"}
{"text":"Disgusting. If you have a craving for Chinese food, step back, breathe, and squeeze one of those packets of soy sauce that you've had in your frig for years into your mouth instead. You will thank me. Drive into Madison if you can."}
