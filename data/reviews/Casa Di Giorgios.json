{"text":"I love this place! My boyfriend and I have been meaning to come here for about three years and now that we're finally here, we have no regrets. The patio is gorgeous and comfortable. The service is fast and always with a warm smile. And the food is delicious! Everything is very reasonably priced, as well. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've been a patron here for years, and LOVE the place.  The food is consistently good, their Insalata di Giorgio is a family favourite, and the wait staff/owners always remember us and give a warm greeting.  I've never had a bad meal here - and I'm consistently impressed with the customer service.  The cherry on top - they've got free parking out back.  That's a big deal in the Beach(es)!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times, dine-in and take-out.   Take-out: You can't beat their pizza special, a three-topping large for ~$15. Ingredients are high-quality, and crust is delicious.   Dine-in: Service is attentive and personal - they'll get to know you after a few visits and will treat you extra special. Staff really go the extra mile to deliver the best possible dining experience. Food is delicious, if a bit typical. Would be a five-star review if they offered more interesting or adventurous specials."}
{"text":"It was our anniversary, and we were both too tired to actually go out anywhere. We placed our order on justeat. 2 orders of veal Parmesan, a Caesar salad, and some bruschetta. The order was finalized and we waited, and waited, and waited. Finally over an hour later our order was delivered. I started taking the tinfoil packages out of the bag, but one of the orders of veal was missing. I called back, and the woman on the phone was extremely rude and actually accused me of trying to scam a free order out of them because she knows that the veal was put in the delivery bag. After 10 minutes of being put on hold, she told me that they would send the driver back with another order. No apology or anything, just attitude. So we waited again, 45 more minutes. I know that mistakes happen and all, but when I'm spending $70 for take out, I don't appreciate being made to feel like some kind of criminal because they're kitchen can't read an order slip properly. Needless to say we won't be back here anytime soon. It really is too bad, they do have some amazing food."}
{"text":"I thought that the food here was really great. It's not exactly in the most picturesque area of Toronto, kind of between Leslieville and the Beaches (right across from the Beaches Cinema). The decor is also pretty dated.   The food is excellent though. I had veal parmesan and mussels to start and both were great. My dining mate had a salad and a pizza. I had a piece of the pizza and it was also really good.   Basically, you're not going to impress anyone by taking them here on a first date because it doesn't look all that fancy. However, if you are looking for a really good Italian meal you can't beat it."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the pasta on the menu.  The gorgonzola gnocchi is a regular favourite of mine.  If you are in need of a reliable neighbourhood spot this is it."}
{"text":"Ein sehr typischer \"Brot und Butter- Italiener\" für die ganze Familie. Neben Pizza natürlich Pasta  mit unterschiedlichen Soßen. Auch Vegetarier werden hier fündig und satt. Vorweg wurde Brot und Butter gereicht. Minestrone war heiß und lecker. Das Hähnchen hatte etwas zu viel Soße für meinen Geschmack. Dafür waren die überbackenen Auberginen mit Spaghetti ein Gedicht. Für die Nachspeise war kein Platz mehr in unserem Magen..."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious pizza. Pasta looked good. Can't fault anything about this place"}
{"text":"Let's be honest, the area isn't the most glamorous what with it being near a Coffee Time, an In-and-Out KFC, a Blockbuster Video and an erotic boutique aptly named Naughty By Night. But sandwiched in this would-be red light district is a little slice of Heaven called Casa di Giorgios.  They have a fine selection of gourmet pizzas to choose from though I opted to create my own: chicken breast with fresh tomatoes along with their cheese blend and pizza sauce which is nothing short of perfection. This was a welcomed answer to the \"What should we eat tonight?\" question.  Should you choose to eat in, their dining area is a romantic setting and the restaurant is complete with parking. The patio is open during the summer and tented and heated during the Fall. The staff is very pleasant and when you make as many visits as I have when I used to live in the area, they soon recognize you as family.  Though the pizza is a delight, the rest of the menu is nothing to sneeze at. Try any of their pasta and you swore you were on death's row as you may have just had your last meal ever."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved my meal here. I got the Gnocchi with pesto sauce and pine nuts and it was delicious, plus it came with tons which I appreciated. It's a great place to go before or after a movie, since it's just across the street from Cineplex Odeon. It was pretty tiny inside though, so I could see it filling up fast on the weekends... they do have a patio for the summer.  My only complaint was the waitress (can't remember her name) didn't come around at all during the meal, she only came to give us our meals. But the taste did make up for it!"}
{"text":"SO disappointed! I can't help but wonder if their chef quit, or maybe they're just trying to cut costs. We always order from here, and we always get the chicken parm. It was always made from a thick, juicy, breaded chicken breast, slathered in home made sauce and cheese. It comes with pasta with the same bolognese sauce. But tonight, we were originally surprised that the order came so quickly. There is usually a long wait for delivery, but tonight, for the first time ever, the order got here before the estimated delivery time. So we started out very pleased, but then saw why the order was delivered so fast. Frozen, mushy chicken cutlets in a canned sauce, topped with processed cheese. Sorry Casa Di Giorgios, believe it or not, when you're a restaurant, the quality of the food matters. I may as well buy a frozen dinner and throw it in the microwave. Never again."}
{"text":"I've known about this place for many years but never gave it a shot until a couple of nights ago.  As soon as my wife and I entered we were warmly greeted right away and offered a table just big enough for two.  The restaurant was almost at capacity when we sat down.  I personally like a lot of space between my table and the other customers.  The tables at this restaurant are too close together.  Our table was sandwiched between a table for two on our right and another table for two on our left.  You could literally rub elbows with the stranger next to you.  This was my only beef with the place.  The lighting is dim to give a romantic appeal. We ordered the bruschetta which came out perfectly crispy and toasty, and the tomatoes were seasoned with enough flavour.  We also ordered the spaghetti alla bolognese.  It was delicious with ample amount of sauce, and not too salty.  I mopped up the left over bolognese sauce with some bread.  It was that tasty.   We also had the caesar  salad, it was a nice portion, fresh all around.  The hostess promptly removed our plates within seconds of noticing we were done.  All in all I was very happy with the delicious food.  I felt like they appreciated having us as their customer.  Meal and tips came out to $40 for two.  I look forward to going back to try something new off their menu."}
{"text":"Great old school checkered table cloth style pasta and pizza.  The Pavarotti pizza is the deluxe pizza.  They deliver too which brings me back to my childhood because their extra large pizza is a REAL EXTRA LARGE PIZZA, not the modern downsized version.  I love going there before a movie.  Not all of their pasta dishes meet my expectations but you know, it's not actually authentic Italian, because I think the owners are from Greece."}
{"text":"This place is great. Comfortable and friendly. We had pizzas and they were amazing!"}
{"text":"After reading all the good Yelp reviews, we decided to try this Italian place near where we were staying in Toronto.   I really wanted to like it, because the service was so lovely and friendly. As soon as we stumbled in the side entrance with our four-year-old, everyone was sincere and welcoming. However, the food was just not good.   We had the bruschetta, which was passable, and then lasagna and spaghetti with meatballs. The lasagna was dry and gummy. The spaghetti noodles were overcooked, and the sauce was too sweet for me. The meatballs were very soft and uniform in texture - I know some people like this style, but it's not for me. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here late one night after a long weekend and we were too tired to cook. I ordered the salad with pears, walnuts and parm as well as the seafood linguine. My boyfriend ordered the tortellini and the mozzarella garlic bread.  The salad was actually really good I seriously should have just gotten that. It was huge and the cheese was delicious. The same can't be said about my pasta, it was bland and the scallops were sooooooo overlooked my boyfriend thought it was chicken. Scallop massacre.  His garlic bread was pretty pathetic I've made way better at home. I didn't even taste any garlic just bread and cheese. He said his pasta was good but who knows.  We didn't even get any booze and the bill was $70. Not worth it. I'm giving them a 2 for the warm quick service and the salad."}
{"text":"Walked by this place a million times on the way to the movies and never even gave it a second glance, but boy were we missing out. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but inside is warm and intimate. Our server was VERY attentive, even putting our napkins on our laps for us. We weren't feeling adventurous at all, and went with the fried calamari, Caesar salad and a four cheese pizza. Everything was fresh tasting and just plain tasty. The two of us were stuffed afterwards, big portions! Great atmosphere, good food and a decent price. Will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Just ordered from here tonight. It was pretty good. I've definitely had better Italian food, but this place has been consistently decent. It is reasonably priced and the portions are quite generous. My wife and I will order 2 pastas and usually have enough left over for another meal. Tonight we had the lasagna and the gnocchi with Gorgonzola and mushrooms, and both were really good.  Recommendations: Pizzas, lasagna, gnocchi, and veal parmigiana"}
{"text":"It was a dark and stormy night. Perfect for pizza delivery. I usually order from Mama's, but I'm trying to keep my business to small independents in the 'hood, so I decided to try Casa di Giorgio. I ordered the salad with grilled veggies and a pizza.  First hurray - My order arrived well within the 45 minutes they told me it would take.  Second hurray - the salad was huge! A ton of really nicely grilled veggies on a bed of greens with some goat cheese. It was delicious. I love grilled eggplant, but its hard to grill it right. No problem here!  Third hurray - the pizza... great thin crust pizza. All my topping were kinda thin - carmelized onions, sun dried tomatoes, roasted peppers... so it was an entirely thin pizza. Next time I'll add more height. Regardless, it was yummy. Crust was buttery and chewy. Obviously use olive oil in the crust. Evenly cooked. Great balance of toppings.  Fourth hurray - I've got leftovers for tomorrow. Fifth hurray - I've definitely found my new pizza ordering place."}
{"text":"Twice in one weekend! Very generous with the wine pours here. Reasonably priced and delicious North American - Italian fare. The lasagna is great, the veal parm is great, and their very open to modifications. Lovely service that makes you feel like you're at a real mom and pop shop."}
{"text":"The only real place for Italian in the Beaches. Not the most picturesque location (across from Harveys). Parking is available behind and on street. They do delivery with uber. Food is good. Eggplant parmigiana has the semblance of something good but it was too tough. Pasta is great. Vino of different varietals of grapes are available."}
{"text":"Shared a great meal with friends. Staff are fantastic. Attentive and courteous. We will be back."}
{"text":"The grilled squid with salad was good, although a bit salty burnt.  Btw, The mussels that I ordered was not fresh.  Some of them has strong fishy smell. Service was good. I will try their pasta next time."}
{"text":"Very friendly home-grown Italian feel that's deeply rooted into the community.  Food was fantastic...we had the Alfredo pizza with Calamari.  Pizza was a perfect blend of cheesy and crispy.  The calamari is super fresh, you can taste it through the batter.  The staff was very friendly down to the delivery driver.  The service was spot on, they know exactly when to ask and how to ask."}
{"text":"Staff here are super-friendly, so it's a real nice place to go to when you're fried but want real food, not fried food. The cooking staff can be seen cooking as you enter so this is not a reheat and serve place. I would have to say it's authentic Toronto Italian -- lots of cheese and tomato on a big plate. In Turin, Italy, where I've been a few times, the cheese is used for flavor rather than filler, and the same goes for the tomato sauce. The pasta serving is about half the size, made up for by separate orders of salad and appetizer.  Something to remember during this UN year of the pulse: Italian food in Italy features beans, which is not the case here. In northern Italian areas such as Turin, meat is common, but comes in quite small portions. Beans are an important source of lean protein In Italy, and of key minerals, which is healthier and cheaper and better for the environment.  Toronto has a fairly high rate of overweight and obesity, and Italy has a relatively low rate. I don't blame the Toronto chefs; I blame the North American customer preference for quantity over quality and variety. While we're waiting for the change, I support local neighborhood places like this."}
{"text":"I was blessed enough to be dining her on New Year's Eve. Walking in I was greeted warmly as if I came to visit family. The staff came to check in with me regularly since I was alone. They made sure I was absolutely comfortable, and I certainly was. I enjoyed the Italian family vibe a lot. The food was wonderful to booth, so overall this was a perfect experience!"}
{"text":"This is always a pleasant place to eat. Decent food. Friendly and very competent staff. Nice outdoor patio. Prices are reasonable. My husband had the lamp b chops and I had veal limoni, the last Jaime we were there. Both were good."}
{"text":"Deliciously satisfies those pizza cravings for lazy nights.   We ordered 2 XL pizzas from Casa di Giorgios - the Originale (Mozzarella, sauce, pepperoni, green peppers, mushrooms) and the Amore (Hawaiian). The thin crust did not overpower the delicious flavours of the sauce and cheese. We found slices to be cut very large (perhaps due to the XL sizing) but were very pleased that they were not overly greasy or too salty.  Total cost including delivery was $45. The pizzas arrived promptly within 50 minutes.  Would like to try their outside patio next time."}
{"text":"What a gem.  My experience with 'authentic Italian' is limited to that of the selection of pasta dishes on many North American cuisine menus.  Real Italian?  What's that?  Skeptical at first at the incredible Yelp rating for this place, we went to see if it's the real deal.  Let's just say, we'll soon be back to this cozy, old-school family romantic (is there such a thing??), friendly restaurant.  The server even teased hubby slightly to put his cellphone away.  It really does have the most wonderful pizzas and pastas - delicate, but robust flavours at the same time.  The covered patio really is a breath of very relaxing and mellow air.  Take advantage of the free parking in the back."}
{"text":"being a new mom who lives downtown i almost gave up on finding a nice family resto where we could take our daughter..... casa di giorgios has now filled that void!  service was welcoming and the food was great.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food here was lovely! We sat on the patio and had a great time. The server was very attentive and the food was beautiful and rustic. I would totally eat here again, it was a great experience. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place offers very traditional Italian restaurant fare well prepared.  Nothing fancy or innovative or modern about the food here. The menu is nothing but Italian classics with no surprises.  But if you want a plate of pasta or a veal cutlet, you'll like it here.  My seafood pasta was fresh and cooked to perfection.  It's an interesting coincidence that this place is so close to the Tulip.  They both have retro menus that might cause scorn from some, but praise from others.  I don't really gravitate to pasta places like this much, but if I'm planning to go to see something at Beaches Theater, I wouldn't hesitate to eat here again.  Definitely adding this place to my list of restaurants my mother would like."}
{"text":"Terrible delivery pizza.  Dry, bland and tasteless.  Ordered a white pizza that was just bread and a little dried out cheese, with a few pieces of prosciutto and a ton of arugula.  Also ordered the Diavolluto pizza which was supposed to have banana peppers and instead just had jalepenos which hurt my stomach.  Beyond that, the same dried out cheese and very little tomato sauce.  You can barely taste it.  The pizza was just super dry.  If they're going to serve pizza like that, at least offer dipping sauce!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place because the line up for the Burger Priest down the street was too long. Once we were seated, it became clear to us that the restaurant was not very clean. There were cobwebs in the corners and the little decorative lamp on our table was filthy. There were flies and mosquitoes flying around at all times. (I can forgive them for this though- I understand how hard it is to make sure bugs don't get in when the servers have to go in and out to serve the people on the patio) The biggest red flag happened when our waiter brought water to our table and we saw that one of the glasses had a very large and obvious pink lipstick stain on the top. There is no way something like that could be missed. We wondered if the glasses had been washed at all! We pointed out the stain to our waiter and he apologized and brought us two new glasses of water. These glasses were cleaner but had a subtle layer of grease all over. We decided not to drink the water at all.   Since we had already ordered when the issue with the water happened, we decided we had to stay for the food. My boyfriend and I both ordered pizzas. My boyfriend's pizza was mediocre and mine was just awful. The chicken on my pizza was stringy looking and overly chewy. The whole thing was really greasy and you couldn't taste the pesto sauce. The quality of the food was definitely not worth the price - our bill came out to a total of $38 (with tax included) for just the two pizzas.   The only redeeming quality of this place was the service. Our waiter was very friendly throughout the night and apologized profusely when we pointed out the lipstick stain on the glass. Unfortunately the friendly service does not make up for the dirtiness of the place and the low quality food. We will obviously not be returning."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  I came here for dinner before a late night movie at the move theatre across the street. The staff are really friendly and wonderfully welcoming. I'm not Italian and I felt like they treated me like their extended Italian family. It was lovely.   They have gluten-free pizza and gluten-free pasta. It's stated at the top of their menu and not next to the individual dishes, so make sure you read over the ingredients to make sure they don't have gluten. I ended up going with a gluten-free pizza with mostly veggies and it tasted great. The sauce was a little light for me (I like a thicker, saucy sauce) but it still tasted great. The portion size is also pretty substantial. I plan on trying the gluten-free pasta the next time I'm there.   They also had a gluten-free chocolate cake for dessert, which was very rich and delicious. There was only one gluten-free dessert option though. Still, I appreciated that they could offer me something other than plain vanilla ice cream, like most places do.  TL;DR Gluten-free pizza, pasta and dessert; great service"}
{"text":"I only ever get the takeout pizza special so I can't comment on the dinning room experience. They have a regular special on their pickup only pizzas. The pizza is more like the pizza from a restaurant in the 70s or 80s, before pizza became gourmet.  But  it is quite good. The crust isn't thin but not too thick either, the ingredients always seem fresh and are generously dolled out on the pizza. I think the medium runs about 13-14$ for three ingredients. Which is pretty good."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood restaurant. Food is fresh and well prepared. Service is great as well. The new covered patio in the summer (and not so summer months with the heaters) is also a true gem. Love the Greco Pizza. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Pretty small place, friendly owners for the most part and GOOD PIZZA! The pizzas are huge, like they say it's personal size, but really it's enough to share between 3 people. It's a little dark on the inside, but that's okay. I would defs come back again for something else."}
{"text":"We waited 30 minutes for our food which is on the longer side. The portions are rather sizable which is probably the best thing for our meal. My group's verdict on the meal is that the flavour needs to be improved for all pasta that we ordered."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza from Casa DiGiorigios last night. It was ready the moment I arrived and exactly as I ordered. The staff was exceptionally friendly. It was almost intoxicating how happy and friendly the staff is. I will be back over and over. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Came around the area for fireworks on Canada Day fireworks and was craving pizza (as usual). I originally wanted to go to Burger Priest, but because waiting in line for half an hour isn't really my thing, why not the pizza place down the street?   The restaurant was relatively packed at 6, but we managed to get a patio seat which is my goal for all restaurants this summer. What I really liked about this place was that they gave you a choice of regular crust, whole wheat or gluten free at no extra charge. It shows to the customer that they actually care about other's dietary needs and you won't have to pay extra if you want to eat healthier (which is redonk).   Antipasto Della Casa (17)   Actually a decent amount of cheeses and meats and would totally recommend if you're sipping something bubbly and waiting for your mains.   La Greco (16) Cheese, pepperoni, olives, feta, onions and all things magical. This pizza had it all and was so on point.   Diavola (14) FAVOURITE. Love spicy food, so this hit the spot.  Servers are amazing and friendly, they have a genuine smile on their faces and seem to really like helping you even on such a busy night. Price is totally fair for what you're getting and the drinks aren't too bad but could use an extra touch.   Oh and warning, it might look tacky on the outside BUT TRUST ME, the pizzas here totally worth it."}
{"text":"An absolutely exquisite restaurant. It's a place that you can have a 5 star meal and not dress to the nines or have to take out a loan.  I think when this place first opened it was a mafia front to launder money but realized they could make delish food and make money with that too.  Every meal I've had that tasted fresh and cooked to perfection.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  Especially for young broke couples."}
{"text":"I just love it here.  So cozy, the food is consistently good, lovely family that owns and operates it.  Great service, we are made to feel so welcome.  It's homey and tasty and I would recommend it to anyone.  The grilled calamari is so good, and fresh, the pasta is good.  I don't find it too fancy but good quality and reasonably priced.  Recommend it."}
{"text":"Can I give this place 6 stars!? Absolutely nothing but positive things to say! We were greeted by this wonderful Italian lady that might have been the owner? First my friends and I ordered the mussels in pasta sauce, rice balls(arancini) as well as a Caesar salad and was also served bread with oil/balsamic. I bought the gnocchi with mushrooms and cream sauce. And to finish it off I got the chocolate and raspberry tartufo (ice cream ball). Hands down amazing food (I'm Italian myself and loved it) and the staff are super nice! This place is cute and quant, perfect for first date,family or just friends! Thanks so much, such a great experience"}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Casa Di Giorgios after all the reviews.  I must say that I've had much better Italian in Toronto.  We had the pizza and lasagna.  The pizza tasted like Dr. Oketer from the grocery store and the lasagna also had a similar flavour to something store bought."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight with friends after the beach. First thing we noticed was that the waitress was extremely rude. We ordered a few dishes to share and overheard her gossiping with her coworkers multiple times about how little we got for a table of 6.   On top of this the food was very underwhelming. The salad I ordered was an over dressed pile of arugula with a few slices of pear, and the pizza we ordered was literally chopped veggies on plain crust. It was extremely bland and disappointing.   Even though the food was dissapointing the worst part, and the part we will remember the most is the rude service we received from our waitress. Next time we're in the area we'll remember to stay clear of this place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It truly is an Italian restaurant. Pizza was amazing. Our server (Christina) was so kind that I fell in love with her. All the customers knew her and most of them would give her a hug upon their arrival. I will definitely be back (every week)"}
{"text":"It was a full house, but luckily there was one table left for two. The servers and staffs are very nice, but our waitress pushed a dish on me that I didn't order.  I ordered their Calamari Fritti (fried calamari with marinara sauce), and yet a plate of grilled calamari on a bed of salad was served. I verified with the waitress saying I ordered Calamari Fritti, yet she insisted that it was what I ordered. I didn't want to argue or make a fuss over it. At the end, we were charged \"Grilled Calamari\" on our bill. With this unfortunate experience, I won't be back, and I can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tonight ordered in gnocchi (with tomato sauce), chicken wings (I wanted some sort of meat to complement my pasta) and tartufo.  I must admit that I didn't have particularly high hopes for the gnocchi because I used to date an Italian guy whose nonna would make it for me fresh and homemade, and sadly had never been able to recapture that goodness in a restaurant meal...until tonight!  Gnocchi was perfect texture and sauce tasted like it came from one of the homemade jars in the cold room of any self-respecting Italian household.  It was outstanding, and am curious to try their other versions!  Chicken wings were a bit dry, but seriously, what business did I have ordering chicken wings from an Italian restaurant?  Tartufo was light and yummy, and perfectly completed the meal.  The portion sizes were great and prices were reasonable.  Would definitely recommend Casa di Giorgio based on food alone."}
{"text":"5th time I've returned to this wonderful little jewel in our neighbourhood.    Loved it so much that I had to write a review about it.  Sunday evening ... looking for alternative meals after a long day of driving ... stopped in at Casa di Giorgios.  Ordered the pesto salmon, alfredo with chicken and bruschetta for take-out.  My toddler loved it so much, she was covered in alfredo sauce and asking for more.  Generous portions, fresh food, tasty, fragant and everything tastes like more!  Finally tried their pizza .. and am hooked.  Worth every cent!"}
{"text":"Yum! This a great traditional Italian restaurant. Very unassuming from the outside and lovely inside with a great patio. Salad, pasta and pizza are the menu and well done. Definitely worth the drive and free parking in the rear. Limited alcohol selection especially with 1 beer on the menu."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. This place has it all. I'm in the neighborhood, so extra points.  If you want real, simple and fresh italian food (i.e. nonna) without the pretense of your typical TO trendy spots - then look no further. Pizza was on point with the best of 'em. Pasta dishes are made simple, yet flavourful. A real old world feeling here. Service was very warm and welcoming. I think this place gets a lot of regulars, because once you eat the food here you will be back (if you like classic italiano cusine)."}
{"text":"'authentic Italian' ... we'll soon be back to nice place, old-school family friendly restaurant.   Great pizzas and pastas - delicate, but robust flavours at the same time.  The patio really is a  very relaxing ."}
{"text":"I haven't had a meal here yet that I didn't enjoy. I've tried many of there gourmet pizzas and the Manicotti was simply delicious. I also just noticed that a second location has opened up on the Danforth - although the website doesn't list two locations!  This is a great little restaurant, just west of the busy beach area!"}
