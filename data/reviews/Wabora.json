{"text":"Like most Torontonians, I am addicted to sushi.  Today we died and went to sushi heaven.....  Wabora is the best sushi I have ever put in my mouth.... I'm scared because it was THAT good, and unfortunately I can't afford to go there all the time.  Granted, the prices are a little steep, the sushi is absolutely delicious. They have a vast selection of items on their very long menu, where the items vary from 7$ to 20$.   My girlfriend and I ordered 4 rolls and split them all; 3 out of the 4 were huge (8 pieces each), and very filling, one was slightly smaller and only had 5 pieces. We were more than stuffed and realized 3 rolls would have been sufficient.   The Volcano Roll is delectable.... it literally melts in your mouth.. I'm probably going to dream about it tonight. The Las Vegas Roll is also delicious with shavings of tempura bits on top of the actual roll...  They have a variety of sauces on various different rolls that are delicious and the presentation of the food is also excellent.   Their seafood is extremely fresh, efficient and super friendly staff, chic atmosphere - ideal for a nice date or a celebratory dinner and drinks. The decor is a little fancy looking for a \"sushi resto-bar\", but that's not even an issue once the food is in your mouth!!"}
{"text":"First off, I may not be the best person to review this place since I was there for a launch party and not regular dinner service.   The food was pretty good,  the fish quality is on the high side and the rolls were inventive and mostly yummy. Had a weird allergic reaction to one of them though I don't know what it was, especially since I have no allergies to seafood or any other food as far as I know. I'd maybe like to go back to try some more since it was better than most downtown sushi places.    Drinks were ridiculously expensive, $9 beers and $18 martini's and that was a \"discounted\" price for the party guests.   Service was generally good, though green for the most part. Some of the servers were frustratingly lacking, inattentive with a strange inability to answer simple questions about the food or drinks. Still, there were a few stars, probably experienced industry peeps. In my opinion, there were maybe 2 or 3 of such servers and they carried the entire night.  The bartenders were obviously not used to the volume of the night, and when I asked about regular nights at the bar, one of them stressed that it was dead pretty much every night. Not a great way to convince people to check the place out on the weekends. He didn't seem to enjoy working there at all.   I asked for a very dry vodka martini, and it came to me with so much vermouth I could not taste the vodka. I sent it back citing that it was much too sweet, and the bartender gave it back stating that it was the vermouth. Needless to say, I didn't want to be \"THAT\" customer so I drank it anyway and ordered another specifically explaining that by dry, I meant little to NO vermouth. Again, drowning in vermouth. Was not impressed. This annoyed me.  All in all, I'd probably go if I had an excuse, but probably will not seek it out on my own. I have to say, it was probably the bartender that turned me off. In a location where the clientele is probably nicer, I don't think it unreasonable to want a properly made martini with decent service."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, and both times everything was amazing. The sushi has so much flavor that it just explodes on your taste buds. I tried different sushi rolls during these two visits, and nothing has disappointed me a bit.   Strongly recommended: valentine roll, love love salmon (which is wrapped up with tender, warm salmon rather than rice and seaweed!).   Green tea here is also very authentic, I am curious as to where they get it from, for $3, you get some premium quality tea.   Service is ok, everybody is pretty chill, and there is no pressure even if you sit for longer and have a nice chat with friends.   One of my favorite places for sushi in entire toronto, and I will for sure make many more visits."}
{"text":"Like some other reviewers have mentioned, the management is a bit shady.  I have been here a few times as I live in the neighbourhood.  The first few times were fine (the food good).  On my birthday, in June, is when it left a bad taste in my mouth. I had a coupon and decided to use it for a few drinks with friends and appetizers before we headed out on the town. The manager told me that I couldn't use the coupon for drinks (even though there were no restrictions on the coupon). He brought over a guy who said he was the \"owner\". This guy told me that they couldn't give out \"free\" drinks and that his auditor had told him to stop.  I told him that I didn't get the coupon for free and therefore, the drinks weren't free.  I'm fully aware that it's illegal to give out free alcohol in Ontario.  He wouldn't budge even though he found out it was my birthday.  My friends wanted to argue, but I decided to leave it alone. We just ordered 2 rolls to cover the coupon.   Just last month, in October, I went with a couple of friends for dinner. I had one coupon left (with an expirty date of December 12, 2011) and knew we'd be using it for food as I just wanted to get rid of it without hassle.  We all had quite a bit of food (bill totalling approximately $200 - way more than the coupon). I gave the waiter my coupon and he said he'd check whether it was valid and had not expired (I knew it had not). He came back to tell me that it had expired. When I pointed out the date, he got confused and said he'd go back to the manager. The manager came over to the table and actually accused me of MANIPULATING the coupon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I decided to go over his head and asked for the owner. He brought over another guy that wasn't the same one I dealt with on my birthday.  I finally found out that I was dealing with the sons of the actual owners.  This guy kept saying the expiry date was wrong.  I got angry and told him I didn't appreciate being accused of tampering with a coupon.  He said he had never said that and never offered an apology for the manager. He told me that he'd look into it and by the time I came back another time to use it, he'd know what had happened.  I told him that I'm using that coupon that night as I PLAN ON NEVER COMING BACK THERE AGAIN. I had to repeat this over and over until he finally applied it and asked for my ID just in case he needed to get ahold of me.    My advice to you, Wabora: If you want to stay in business be more respectful to your customers.  In these hard times, there's a great likelihood you're going to go out of business."}
{"text":"Wabora is okay.  I expected much better from the Thompson Hotel.   The service is okay, the menu's have that cheesy, hole in the wall sushi place look to them and there WAY too many options to choose from.  The rolls are massive and very saucy.  I can't say I crave nor remember any of their dishes."}
{"text":"3.5/5! Bought the $40 sushi making class groupon. It's still expensive for what you get but an enjoyable experience. The veggie roll is amazing and the tuna tower is decent. The chefs are very friendly. Great activity for groups!"}
{"text":"I bought a groupon for Wabora a while ago and decided to use it with my friend.   First I'd like to state the pros and why I gave it 3 out of 5 stars.  The food is good.  It's nothing special.  It's presented well and the taste of the food is good but again nothing special.  The establishment is nice and is in a posh trendy area.  After ordering the food took approximately 15-20 (about average time) minutes and looked quite good.  I ordered the Fire Chicken and my friend had ordered  the Spicy Pork Bulgogi. Some cons, my dish was about $27 and my friends dish about the same at $30.  He's not Korean but I am.  To pay a whooping $30 each for our dishes was pretty outrageous.  To go out to an actual Korean restaurant and order $60 of food, you'd end up with a feast to feed 8-10 people.  The ambiance was nice though and the background sound was loud but not overly crazy.   I probably won't return to Wabora only because I feel that it's overpriced for what you're getting.  I'm not discouraging others from going though.  The food was good and  the place is classy."}
{"text":"As the super uber chic Thompson Hotel  has opened for the glamourati to be seen, another famed restaurant import opens for business.  Wabora where the original hails from Bracebridge Ontario showcases it's sushi strength by highlighting 52 rolls on the menus all complete with glossy photos which run from a reasonable they run from $6.50 to as high as $16.95. Let me remark that if you wanted creative sushi rolls, this is the destination and owner Kim is definitely not afraid to use spice, crunch or cream cheese in these rolls.  If you can't figure out what to choose, I recommend you go to the back of the menu and use the 'choose 4', 'choose 6' and 'choose 8' roll options.  They narrow the selection down for you including typical rolls like the spicy tunas and salmons of the world and avocado, veggie tempura and eel to the more innovative Wabora crunch rolls, titan roll, valentine, sundae and crispy crunch rolls."}
{"text":"We celebrated a birthday here for my father in law - the ambiance is awesome and I love their chic decor. The food was on par with the nicer restaurants in the entertainment district area. I would happily go again, maybe for some of their sushi making classes!"}
{"text":"Awful service. We were so disappointed because we spent $100 bucks on two people. I could have eaten again after.   The sushi isn't that great but it is good. They are extreme with the sauce."}
{"text":"My friends and I purchased the Travelzoo vouchers that were available at http://bit.ly/nrT7Gy . We made a reservation for a party of 8 and specifically asked the host about how the vouchers worked. Three of us arrived first and were seated at the table. When I mentioned to the waiter we were using the Travelzoo vouchers he informed us that there was a limit of one per table. This was not written anywhere on the voucher (including the fine print) nor was it communicated to us when we made the booking.   When I told the manager that we had mentioned we were using the voucher when I called and made the reservation - he did not believe me. He even had the audacity to go to the front and ask the host if this was true. When he returned, he told me I did not say that to the host and implied I was making it up.  This is where things took a turn for the worse. After much back and forth about the voucher issue, the manager finally agreed to accept them even though (in his words) \"What we were doing was very wrong\". I thought this would be the end of our problems - boy was I in for a treat...  The manager then proceeded to inform us that the water that had been poured for the table was not included in the voucher and had to be taken away. I thought he was joking and laughed it off but immediately stopped laughing when he grabbed the glass out of my hands.  At this point our table was infuriated and decided to leave. I have never felt so insulted in my entire life, especially not at a restaurant. For the manager to imply that our using a voucher was indicative of us not being able to afford to eat a full meal there is completely insane. In fact, our entire group ended up dining at Jacob & Co. Steakhouse that night and spent significantly more than $65 a couple (hell, we spent more than $65 a steak).  After the weekend, I tried to follow up with the restaurant owners via phone (and online) and was only offered up a half-hearted apology. I was told \"the manager was just doing his job\". As an avid Toronto restaurant-goer, I figured I would do mine as well. It is my hope that this post will encourage everyone to steer clear of this so called \"restaurant\", and request a refund for their Travelzoo voucher if they purchased one. I also think the poor service at Wabora reflects on the Thompson Hotel chain as a whole and they should re-consider affiliating themselves with this restaurant.  As an aside, I did follow up with Travelzoo who were very responsive and apologetic, and provided a refund for our group. My issue is not with Travelzoo, but with Wabora and specifically their manager Daniel."}
{"text":"This customer service is terrible and the bar staff/wait staff can be rude.  The food is average and I would recommend going to Blowfish across the street instead."}
{"text":"This restaurant is quite good. Their sushi is a bit overpriced for what you get but not bad. This place should be under Korean as it is Korean owned and their korean dishes are quite good"}
{"text":"The sushi here, like many have rightly described, is saucy and overpriced. I enjoyed my 1st and 2nd bites, and after that the food started to lose its flavour to sauce. There was one vegetarian roll (can't remember its name) that was an exception to this. That roll was quite tasty.  If you like fancy presentation and sweet/saucy/mayonaise-doused rice, you might like Wabora. Otherwise I would not recommend this restaurant. You ca easily find more delicious Japanese food in Toronto at a much more reasonable price.  this review is strictly based on my personal opinion"}
{"text":"Sushi Making Class, Groupon deal.  For $40 each, my friend and I got to make two sushi rolls and eat them! It was really fun experience. We had a great time learning to make sushi. The main chef and two helping chefs were very friendly and even joked around with us during it. We made spicy tempura maki roll and a tuna tower sushi roll. Both were super delicious. Their ingredients provided were high quality, and the teaching was good too.   I'd recommend the deal!"}
{"text":"What can I say other then this place  1) has over priced sushi   2) is way tooo pretentious   3) staff who do not care   4) servers who will try to rip off your party.    People of Toronto. IN the immortal words of Chuck.D....Don't Believe the Hype!   Too the staff and owners of Wabora.... Do you really think you can fool the Elite of Toronto into paying for your second rate fish and designs you call sushi? We will not be fooled again.   To the server who went out of his way to throw on extra items to my friends bill, for shame sir. Had you had acted with honesty you would have been tipped better.   When this was brought to the manager's attention he simply shrugged and acted as if he could not care less. So a $2000 dinner bill means nothing to you? Wow! Way ti alienate a group of 25 people and now I will spread the word far and wide during TIFF. Stay away from Wabora."}
{"text":"I think this place has more pretensions about what it thinks it is than what it is in reality.  The decor is trying to be upscale, but I thought it looks a bit clubby. I felt like I was at a bar in the Club district, expecting the people at the front couches to order bottle service. The 2-person tables in the back are too close - could it have hurt them to just take one table out and spaced us out a bit more comfortably? I was confused by the atmosphere as well, because while it was trying to be upscale, the clientele was pretty casual.  It was a Friday evening and our row was busy, but the service was quick and our waiter was nice. No problems there.   However, everything is pretentiously overpriced. I don't think any of the food I saw coming to other tables warranted a price tag of around $30 (and I know plenty of other places where $30 is worth $30 in terms of quality and quantity). This place is not an upscale or unique restaurant! Charging prices like these is misleading.  We had a coupon and, as we obviously didn't want to blow it on just one dish, we decided to order sushi rolls. Except for the interesting cooked salmon sushi roll (super rich tasting and warm), the others were disappointing. Pieces of each roll, without fail, fell apart on our chop sticks and were unevenly cut. They may have been long, but there was no girth to them. Few flavours stood out. This place was so cheap, they even skimped on the rice to hold the darn rolls together.  Thank goodness our coupon was a gift, because this place is a total rip-off."}
{"text":"My original plan for the evening was to go to Blowfish but got there after the kitchen closed. The manager was kind enough to send us over to Wabora. The restaurant is very nice but its deadsville. Granted we got there 1/2hr before the kitchen closed but its was a thursday night at 11pm.  One of the most important things to me is a wine list. I like a nice Reisling. I was pleasently surprised with their selection. Our server was very friendly and helpful  Food- I like to look at the menu while I write my reviews to kickstart my memory. It would appear that the website is down so I will go by memory  Salmon Sushi- 5/5 ordered a second order after wabora roll-i think its wrapped in cucumber, 3/5  Beef Kalbi- 4/5 very yummy gyoza- 3/4"}
{"text":"I went to Wabora for drinks and light bites last week. First of all, I love the ambience. I think it's a beautiful room.   The service could have been better. We were one of four occupied tables, and still had to flag a server down. Once we had him, he did a good job. Kept the sake coming with a smile.   We ordered: The sashimi trio, the yellowtail heaven and a spider roll.  The sashimi trio was out of this world! the fish melted in my mouth. I highly recommend it! it was a 5 star appetizer.   The Yellowtail heaven was a tremendous disappointment and the reason for this 3 star review. In my opinion yellowtail is the most delicious type of sashimi. Cool and refreshing. However, Wabora's yellowtail heaven wasn't as fresh as it should have been.  It was a two star appetizer.   The spider roll was good.   The sake list was impressive. We had an amazing cold non-filtered sake, that I wish I could remember the name of.  (Our server recommended it.)  I'll probably return to Wabora, but I can't in good faith recommend it. I'm not saying don't go. Just keep your expectations moderate."}
{"text":"MMMMmmmm.  Beautifully decorated, this restaurant is the latest food hotspot to open in the Thompson Hotel.  This location is Wabora's second, after their successful opening in Bracebridge, Muskoka.  They have over 60 rolls to choose from (60!), everything from the standard California, to steak, spicy tuna, and everything in between.  The sashimi was delicious and the fish pieces were very large.  An assortment of 10 will set you back about $30.  They were so fresh, they literally melted in your mouth.    We also had tempura, which was light and perfectly cooked, and steamed dumplings, which was a big hit at our table.  If fish isn't your thing, they have many great entrees to choose from, including fried chicken, kobe beef, and pork.   Would have been 5 stars, but they still don't have a liquor license!  We will definitely be back to try more dishes, but next time with lots of sake!"}
{"text":"First off, I would give it a zero...but the food was actually decent.  I got the $10 chicken teriyaki lunch bowl and got a roll of spicy tuna roll.  Chicken and vegetables and sushi were great.  It was the brown rice that I had an issue with.    Nowhere on the menu did they say that the brown rice has mixed beans in there.  so I didnt notice this til the end of the meal when I saw a chickpea ( I am allergice to chickpease).  I informed the waiter and asked him if there were indeed beans in the rice or if it was somehow mistakenly included.  He said that it was part of the rice.  I was furious, how can a restaurant be so negligant in not including something like that?  I know lots of people who are allergic to some bean or another.    When I informed the waiter that I had to go get an allergy pill b/c of their negligant, he just kind of shrugged his shoulders.  I just got back from there as I am writing this review and am fuming.  If I didnt need to get an allergy tablet, I would have let them know right then and there.  If they at least acknowledged the fact that I could have very well died (its an allergy that constrains my breathing), I wouldnt have posted this negative review and let it go.  But the indifference by the staff shows the ignorance and stupidity of the owner to not train their staff properly and shows a complete lack of humanity.  Never going back here again!  Stay away!"}
{"text":"I went because I have two Team Buy coupons to use there. I went with my sister one night and a friend another night. I have to say, both times, the food was fantastic and the service was great. It is pricier than other places, but the sushi roles are unique and taste fabulous. If you are looking for a place where you can get cheap sushi, this is not the place. I did feel like it was worth it though. I had the black code appie which was AMAZING. We ordered Edamame, two roles and one dessert each and one bottle of white wine. Our total bill came up to about $140 (not subtracting the coupon). If we hadn't had wine, it would have been closer to $100. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a nice night out on their patio with some good food."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place exploring King West. It was between this or the diner. We went with Sushi. It was a pretty busy place on a Friday night, with lots of coming and going and a busy bar. We were seated in this awkwardly shaped both. No offer to take coats and no coat hangers in sight. When the waiter showed up he said \"Hi, can I take your order\". No hello, no specials, just wanted to know what we were eating.   That's where the prompt service ended because we got our food and he disappeared for about 45 minutes. It took forever for them to clear the table and I had to nearly beg for the bill. The wait was so long it made my honestly contemplate if you could be accused of dining and dashing if they never bring you the bill?  The food was much better than your average cheap sushi joint, but hardly that much better to justify the higher prices. I'd rather eat at Japango for less money. Also, no wasabi under the fish - not acceptable for place with prices like this."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place is really great. Their lunch special is great and great portion as well. The Red Dragon roll is to die for, I just wish their price for dinner is not as steep. For a bento box, its about $22 - add $5 and you can have all you can eat sushi some place else. I would only come here during lunch, or when I'm not crazy hungry at dinner. Overall though, I would come back. Staff are amazing as well, very friendly and accomodating."}
{"text":"I recently bought a $40 Groupon deal and attended a sushi making class with my friends on the past Saturday.    We were taught how to make two rolls: spicy vegetable tempura roll and crispy valentine's roll. The chefs were very friendly and they gave straightforward instructions. We were also given ample fillings to work with. FYI, you don't need to make the sushi rice, as they would be prepared for you, ready to roll. It was fun to make rolls with your friends, share some laughs and eat your own creation afterward. They were quite filling and delicious.   I would say $40 deal was alright, still a bit overpriced. I wouldn't recommend trying this class without the deal, as it would just not worth it.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Amazing, friendly, professional service,   Very high quality and interesting (some very unique) sushi, prepared with artistry and pride.   Huge menu with tons of variety."}
{"text":"This place would have received a better review if the service was better.  We had a nice meal and it came to an end with a sour note.  The server informed us that they cannot process my American Express.  It was kind of strange since the bill came in an AMEX branded folder.  She could not explain why all of a sudden this was not possible so she sent someone else.   He was extremely argumentative, which made the whole experience a downer.  I will never come back here."}
{"text":"so.. this is what i think.. i went there twice.. so i think i have a good idea of their consistency.. their Korean food were great!!!! they don't say that they have Korean menu but half of their stuff are Korean and it was Good... Kalbi steak was so good i melted.. both times.. but i thought their sashimi appetizer serving size was ridiculous!!!!!!!!  let me talk about the service.. since i am Korean, i know how to serve dolsotbibimbap, and the way my servers(both times) served it they did not do it properly and i was so disappointed because there is whole technique to eating this particular dish... but other then that they did decent job recommending and serving our food and drinks.. i am looking forward to seeing them improve over time!"}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good, but the service is a little green. But given the fact this restaurant is so new it doesn't really surprise me."}
{"text":"Wabora tries to be upscale, but it's not.  I get that it's situated inside the Thompson, where the rent must be extraordinarily high. However, the prices are unjust (except for perhaps their lunch menu) for the quality and quantity. That said, the food is good--just not worth it.  The servers are friendly, but inexperienced and often lack English proficiency. It's run by Koreans and they  hire Korean students (some who are temporarily here on a working holiday  visa) and under staff to control labour costs. How do I know? I'm Korean; I know how many Korean restaurants operate; and can tell whether Koreans are born here or not."}
{"text":"This restaurant is kind of hidden in my opinion which is sad because it's so gorgeous, stylish and chic. It looks almost like a lounge but it's a sushi bar. Tons of seating, open pretty late for a hotel restaurant, the sushi was pretty good. My table, we got mango, California, spider, avocado and house roll which I didn't eat because it had a slice of raw fish in it lol :(   The lighting is dark but you can still see your partner/friends. Server was amazing, really helpful and always swung by our table when we needed her. What I actually was amazed by, was the drink menu, Sooooooo many options and specialty house drinks. I had this blue drink( I forgot the name of it, something Toyko) tasted pretty good and was really strong lol they aren't cheap with the alcohol   Really nice atmosphere. Don't forget to come by here if your staying at the Thompson :)"}
{"text":"There is a lot more to the menu here than sushi, but I can only comment on the sushi, as this is all that we ordered. What I can say about the sushi here is that it's not for the purists.   Portions are quite large, and very attractive, but their good looks can be attributed to the multi-coloured sauces that adorn them.  I found that these sauces somewhat overwhelmed the taste of the other ingredients.  It didn't taste bad by any means, just not traditional. I prefer a simple hunk of fresh red tuna wrapped in rice and nori.   The interior of the restaurant is upscale and urban, and certainly fits in to a boutique hotel.  Perhaps the brightest part of our experience was our server.  She was knowledgeable, friendly, helpful, attentive and incredibly professional overall.  The best service I've seen in a long time. In all, this is a good restaurant to go to with company,  for the environment and the \"fun\" sushi.  If you're simply looking for pure, traditional sushi, you should look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food is alright, service is decent, management of this restaurant is SUPER shady and very disrespectful.  I went in with a coupon that didn't have any blackout dates or restrictions.  They said they couldn't honour it because it was Valentine's Day.  I said they had to.  The manager (a really short guy) stood at my table bickering with me about how it's their policy to be unaccomodating.  In the end, they took the coupon but left a really bad taste in my mouth for giving me strike, in front of my date, on Valentine's Day.  That alone is a reason I would never go back to this restaurant.  Also, the place is a rip.  Never go without a coupon.  27$ or something like that for Yaki Udon.  Jesus."}
{"text":"This is a solid 3.5.  Let's start with the basics - the food is good - tried tons of the sushi as we were a party of 8 and got two different boats.  Great variety, lots of flavour - really high quality.  The atmosphere is a bit lacking...again,think the Thompson has missed the mark on authenticity.  Seems vacuous and contrived.  Service is fine.  Just fine.  Nothing great and at that price-point I would expect better.  Ok, but not awesome...not worth rushing, but if you are in the area and like good sushi, you will be pleased."}
{"text":"Nice decor and ambience, never packed or loud. Food is nothing spectacular and the variety of rolls is so extensive that it's slightly confusing. Luckily there's a separate pull-out section of the menu that describes each type of roll in detail - most of them are \"crunchy\", i.e. deep-fried, but they do offer some healthy options, including brown rice.  Expect to pay ~$40 per person for a couple of orders of rolls and one drink. I'd come back since I live nearby but there are better options for Japanese cuisine in the city (just not in the King/Bathurst area)."}
{"text":"Wabora was open New Years Day, a big plus if you are a Japanese person exercising your ancestral duty to pig out on New Years sushi! And it was very good -  much better than I expected even. Due to the holiday, the place was pretty empty, so maybe the chef paid extra attention to our rolls? They were really delicious! Spider roll, ebi, rainbow, something with all different kinds of roe on top, more.... I was worried that the sushi here would be too mayonnaise-ified and inauthentic, and while it's definitely innovative/fusion, the fish was fresh and delectable. Presentation was gorgeous, and while it's not cheap, it wasn't terribly expensive either. Yummy cocktail list too. I was super happy they were open, and it made for a fun New Years Day!"}
{"text":"Went there on Sat. for dinner and was plesantly impressed with the service and food.    Decor is elegant, you can see the sushi chefs working away, nice artwork of cottage country and they even had a dj spinning music.  Ordered the hurricane, serpentine and lobster roll and all were good (I like the hurricane the best personally).  The tuna tower appetizer is interesting but not really worth the $20 price.  G/F ordered the salad which was huge, and I also ordered a fire chicken dish. (It was a ridiculous amount of food I know, took the fire chicken home ;)  Waiters were attentive, always made sure our water was full, checked in to see how we were enjoying the food and I think even the owner (or manager) came over to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  Overall I'd go back, there's a bunch of rolls on there that I'm interested to check out."}
{"text":"Despite living within a 5 minute walk of this restaurant, I will never go again nor will I recommend it.  Now, that sounds really dismal, and it's not all bad. The cooked food was actually pretty tasty and the sushi was decent. The decor is nice. I enjoyed the tuna tower   However, the server had no idea what she was talking about. And the food was very overpriced.  If you're closeby and don't have a budget - sure.  However, with so many other restaurants close by either better priced or just far more inventive for the same price (Lee, Blowfish to name two), I would just never go again."}
{"text":"I was at Wabora last night for an anniversary dinner and it was VERY tasty! Yes expensive but VERY TASTY! We shared the tuna tower... this \"salad\" comes out really beautifully - a tower of rice, avocado, crab and spicy raw tuna This was actually my first time having raw tuna and I really enjoyed it They can mash up the salad for you but we decided to do it ourselves .. there are also 4 kinds of caviar on the plate We also had the sundae roll .. the sushi was DELICIOUS! 4 sauces the give it a really unique flavour and just a hint of spicy All of their rolls look beautiful and unique (i would come here again just for the rolls) The rolls really are not too ridiculous in terms of price .... When compared to an AYCE, sure it seems like a lot .. but, compare to any high end sushi place, and the prices are not too outrageous .. the sundae roll was $12-$13 for 8 pieces and was very good; their most expensive roll is $18 and features lobster tempura We both had entrees - I have the lobster tail dinner and my boyfriend had the \"love me tender\" which is 10oz of amazingly soft beef tenderloin The lobster was DELICIOUS! Not overdone or with too much sauce .. just a delcious butter based sauce. The lobster also came with a popcorn shrimp and a green salad; i liked that the salad had crunchy noodles on top the beef tenderloin was amazing! very tender and delicious .. it came with the same green salad, steamed rice, a rice cake type thing under the meat and a popcorn shrimp as well; the only negative.. the bbq sauce was kind of strange .. a bit too sweet for our liking.. .however, the meat was so tasty and tender.. we didn't need any sauce overall, a very filling and satisfying meal and we were very happy with the experience   also, very nice decor.. sort of lounge-esque, which i liked they also have a DJ that starts later in the evening (i think around 8:30 or 9... not 100% sure) it';s a very laid back but classy place"}
{"text":"I purchased a voucher for a sushi making class at Wabora.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  The ingredients were extremely fresh and flavourful.  The class itself was alot of fun, and very hands-on.  I can only imagine how good the food would have been if the professionals had made it (and not me)!   The decor was very chic, matching its surrounding on the King West scene, and at the Thompson hotel, and reminded me of all of those chic restaurants I used to frequent in New York.  I would definitely return for a proper meal, and another class :)"}
{"text":"I'm surprised that Wabora doesn't have exclusively 5-star ratings on Yelp. I am continuously impressed when I go to Wabora.   I love the atmosphere/lighting/decor... great for an intimate night out, or a celebration dinner. The service - from my experience - was great. [I should mention I was a server for 10 years and have fairly high expectations. I have nothing to complain about.]  The food is AMAzing. If you like sushi, you will think you've died and gone to heaven. You MUST try the crunchy roll. It's one of the best things I've ever put in my face. My other vice at Wabora is their cosmopolitan martinis. Priced at $14 each - ouch! - they are the best cosmos in the city; clean and strong -- a champagne pink colour. So good, I usually have to have two. The last item I'll rave about is the Tuna Tower (appetizer). It comes on an unusually large plate because after the server has presented it to you they will ask if you would like them to mix it for you. Say yes. If you mix it yourself you will muck it up. Once mixed properly, it is the oddest but most flavourful stuff I've ever had. I could eat a plate-full and still want more.   For those of you who prefer non-sushi options, they serve steak, lobster, rice and noodle dishes, cooked fish... the list goes on.  Final things to mention are coupons and classes. Anytime we see a groupon for Wabora we buy it. I love this restaurant and if I can eat there for half off, even better. Sushi-making classes are great. Do it with someone you love, or a date -- it's super fun and you get to eat what you make."}
{"text":"Waiter is friendly, pours water and I end up waiting about thirty minutes. Four exceptionally beautiful women noticed me waiting patiently, and sent over a stiff drink ... With a cherry on a stick.  Very 2012 :) thank you for the moment to those four gems. Most incredible was our waiter's (I call him skippy) suggestion of the sake.  The smooth light flower esque one.  It was fantastic. Dunno what it was called, nor could I pronounce it.  But tantalizing .... Very fitting :D. Thanks Wabora.  I knew I could count on you."}
{"text":"The staff here are all really nice. We had a table of 15 for a friend's birthday. The rolls and food was all pretty decent. Nothing jumped out at me as amazing. A tad pricey, The tuna tower is their thing to order!"}
{"text":"Food great service not so much. Very chic and hip inside ifyour into that scene great. Way over priced food good don't get me wrong but wow...  But holly lighting batman, I couldn't see a freaking thing on the menu, it was so dark. Now I am all for mood.lighting but come on....if I cant see the menu and I am using my phone to read it you now you have some serious lighting issues.  Besides stabbing myself in the face and my friends hands due to the cave like darkness, the food was good. What ever it was. PRICEY...But good. Service not.so much. They just plopped our order on the table and walked away. Hoping we could find it and figure out what it was..."}
