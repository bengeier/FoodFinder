{"text":"Great food and great service.  Don't listen to a person living in Texas who has never been to the restaurant.  Enjoy the ambiance created by Dave and his unique take on the tastes of the world.  Definitely somewhere to go and have great food!"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere here were great. Good food to tempt every palate. I will most definitely come back. It was a delight to eat here."}
{"text":"Amazing flavours. If you read nothing else, that's my review in a condensed phrase.  I ordered the \"tester platter\" as I called is because I knew by looking at the menu there were many things I wanted to try. The version I chose comes with your choice of two tacos, guacamole or salsa and chips, and an empanada or Jamaican patty.  I started with the salsa and chips. I was extremely surprised as well as pleased to see how incredibly fresh they were. The salsa appeared to have been freshly chopped just as I ordered it and the chips came literally out of the fryer. The combination of flavors was amazing. For myself personally, I added some of the hot sauce provided on the tables as it wasn't quite spicy enough. Better to err on the side of caution when it comes to peoples palates!  Being lactose intolerant, I always have to be on the lookout for sources of dairy and there were a few but the chef easily accommodated my needs. I chose the pulled pork and jerk chicken tacos. The mango salsa with the pulled pork was a beautiful melding of tastes. The meat portion was generous as well as juicy. The jalape√±o mayo on the jerk chicken was absolutely brilliant. I would definitely have both again. I can only imagine how amazing they must taste with cheese!  The empanada was a surprise as well. What is normally a pastry type crust, was replaced with a crunchy cornmeal type crust. It was crunchy, almost like a corn dog, if a corn dog tasted superb.  The main thing I was impressed with was the freshness of everything. The quality of the ingredients really shines through. It was quite a treat to have something so focused on taste as opposed to shelf life.  Definitely worth the visit!!!"}
{"text":"I went opening day and had all but one thing on the menu. It was delicious and reasonably priced. The staff were all very friendly and personable. One of them even went and found the Santa visiting around Kensington so the little boy over at a neighbouring business could deliver his letter to Santa! That's going above and beyond!  The bad review from Christopher M. is nothing but a blatant lie, many of us know that he's never stepped foot into this establishment but is instead choosing to grind his personal axe by slandering a new and upcoming business."}
{"text":"The Passion put into the opening day at this restaurant by Dave was nothing short of a inspiring. He allowed people to be apart of the experience, including celebrations, challenges, and finally the food. Well done to Deva Dave on taking on opening a business during such tough times in Calgary. Wish him and his staff the best in the months to come."}
{"text":"food was great! my fresh tacos tasted just like a place in Mexico that I went out of my way to eat at 5 of the 9 days I was there most recently.  Don't listen to reviews from people that post nothing but bad reviews...I mean who rates like 5-6 employment agencies as a1 star? Maybe YOU'RE the problem."}
