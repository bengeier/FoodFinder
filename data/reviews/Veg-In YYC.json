{"text":"This place is awesome! Owners are fantastic and have a true passion for vegetarian and vegan foods that are healthy and beneficial. The food is absolutely delicious! So much variety, and fast service, love this place:)"}
{"text":"I'm not veggie but I was craving good healthy food after work so I thought I'd give this place a shot.
I'm so glad I did. I have a new go to place to eat downtown.
Good food, positive vibes, feeling happy and healthy. Words arent enough just go try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"O.M.G. 
This place is amazing. the ingredients are treated with respect, care and passion and the flavors that are created are sensational. 
Natalie and the owner Sehra are brilliant. Friendly, fast, happy to join in conversation, funny. 
What a dynamic duo. 
I dived into a Drooling Hippie (flatbread) with gusto. The lassi wild Cherry was perfect. 
Wow. 
If you love flavor, honest food that's good for you and your soul ..... this is your go to place."}
{"text":"This cute little family run place was busy when my bf and I walked in. 
While we were waiting for our food, we heard three young men raving about their meals and commending the owners on its deliciousness. 
Made us even more excited for our food and it did not disappoint. It took a while to receive our order but that's because everythinf is made to order. 
I'm happy a little local spot like this offers healthy, original items since I hate to admit, vegetarian/ vegan food can be sort of boring or bland. The prices are great and a single veggito filled me right up. 
A must is the lassi, we shared a mango flavoured one. Next time I'll be having my own."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch with a friend. It was recommended by my colleagues at work. 

I had a flat bread with smashed samosas, greens and other veg toppings. It was very tasty and filling - if a bit heavy on the carbs. The staff are lovely and accommodating and will make most things to order depending on what you want. My friend had a wrap. It was huge and she enjoyed it too.
The only downside was the hair I found in my food.
The atmosphere leans to take out, but there are a few seats to eat in.

{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious and the prices are very fair. This is a great place to pick up lunch or dinner to go. Its a  small clean cafe with only a few places to sit. More of a pick up place than a dine in. I highly recommend this place and will be back."}
{"text":"What an amazing place! A group of us descended on it yesterday and service was quick and friendly and the food oh so good. Even the non-vegetarians amongst us said it was amazing food. Love this place, just wish it was located outside of downtown! But worth the trip."}
{"text":"Love this place! I finally came here yesterday to grab dinner on the way home and I was super impressed. The service was amazing - she was so lovely and helpful. I asked for her veggie burrito (veggito) recommendation and I'm glad I did. The Mardi Gras (samosa) veggito was delicious.

She made it spicy for me and even offered me the option of adding the spice to it or giving me a spicy sauce to add myself. Plus while I was waiting I got to try one of their lassi's for free as they made a bit extra. So good!

Their meals are all $10 and under, the Mardi Gras veggito was $8 and totally worth it. The tortilla was thin and crispy and the 'samosa' filling was just the right amount of spicy. I was sad when I finished it... but excited to go back!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't have expected to find Indian fusion cuisine in Calgary, but boy am I thrilled I did. Their samosas are top notch, which is why all of their most popular dishes involve the samosas in some fashion. The wrap for the burritos are a little thicker which add a great layer of texture to the soft ingredients on the inside. The flatbreads are so unique, for a lack of a better word. 
I also had the Spicy Chai Lassi and it was so tasty and creamy. Mine was vegetarian but since they do all of their other vegan dishes really well, I'm assuming their dairy-free lassi options are just as good. Calgary is in need of more veggie options so I'm so happy that this place is doing it really well!"}
{"text":"Vegan Indian fusion.. what else could this veghead want? had the Bollywood Fantasy Veggito and it was amazing!!"}
{"text":"I'm vegan and gluten free and found several great options to choose from. The staff was friendly and helpful. This is a take out spot, so there isn't a ton of seating to enjoy your food there. 

The only downside is the ordering system is a tad disorganized. Maybe this is because we had four people in our group and they aren't used to larger groups (again, seems like a quick take out lunch spot for locals). But, regardless, the staff was accommodating, kind and quick.

And get the samosa. Even if you don't really want it. It's so good. You won't regret it. :)"}
{"text":"Yowza, this place is fantastic. I had the Boat Wrap, which was vegan naan bread with cauliflower wings, potatoes, lettuce, cucumber inside -- incredibly flavourful and delicious, while still remaining simple. The service was very friendly and quick, and prices are very reasonable. I will absolutely be back every chance I get."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan or vegetarian but this place had great reviews so I decided to try it out. Definitely did not disappoint!!! The owner is super friendly and the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Very interesting and tasty food! You certainly don't have to be a vegeterian or vegan to enjoy their dishes. They prepare it based on your taste, with a bit more heat or none at all. Make it gluten free if you want. We shared a flatbread and a burger, both very delicious. Portion size and price are good. 

The owner is a lovely and very welcoming person. You can see - and taste - that she is very passionate about the food. It's all fresh and full of flavor. Burgers, flatbreads, soups, burritos, lassie, dessert... you name it, it's quite a selection to choose from. 

It's more of a take-out place, there is some seating available, but no washrooms."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! The ingredients are so inventive and so well made, that this will be a favorite restaurant, whatever your eating preferences. 

I tried the special wrap sandwich that featured tofu crumbles, roasted and fresh veggies, and a garnish of pea protein and ground walnut \"meat.\" It had a Mexican-style seasoning blend, and the in-house Veg-in sauce. One of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. N

I noted that the poutines on the menu are also vegan. I can't wait to get back to Calgary and try them as well. There are so many incredible menu options, that I might need to stay a week."}
{"text":"Staff are very friendly. The food is also tasty. My only complaint is that the wraps are smaller for what you might get elsewhere for the same price, although they are unique. I was a bit hungry still afterwards but overall good experience and would recommend!"}
{"text":"I am very very glad that a vegan place exists in downtown Calgary near from my workplace.  I visited Veg-In twice, and had the Bollywood Fantasy and the Veggie Wrap.  Both were delicious.

Best of all was the feeling of supporting a cruelty-free business and knowing that I put my money in a good place."}
{"text":"I kept seeing pictures of this place popping up in my Instagram feed. \"What is this place? Where is it? They have milkshakes?\" So when a friend suggested we go get lunch together, I was stoked to finally have the opportunity to try them out. 


While Calgary has improved in this area over the years, it's still pretty dang serendipitous when I can have more than one menu item that isn't a side dish. Bonus points when I can customize it for my gluten sensitivity. Skip a semester and make the dean's list, because the service is genuinely friendly and amazing. 

Veg-In is in a small, sparklingly clean location; tucked away downtown, but close to Macleod Tr, so getting there and finding parking isn't too difficult for lunch. They are very easy to spot when driving down 6 Ave. When I walked in to meet up with my friend, I was warmly greeted by 3 women behind the counter. They have a few regular menu items, and some weekly specials on rotation that they announce on social media.

For lunch, I had one of their three \"veggitos,\" the \"Bollywood Fantasy.\" It's an Indian inspired veggie burrito stuffed with potatoes, cauliflower, garlic and other spices. When I requested the gluten free wrap; I was told that it would take an extra 15-20 minutes, but I didn't mind, because they make them by hand. To tide me over for the wait, I ordered a vegan banana lassi, which is made with fresh fruit and either coconut or soy yogurt. You can get a traditional lassi with dairy yogurt, as well. My friend also had a lassi, and a veggito stuffed with pan fried tofu. 

(Side note: Can I just say how much I love that their menu items have fun names, but aren't overtly stereotypical vegan names that might steer your omnivore friends away?)

The Bollywood Fantasy was worth the wait, and so pretty, everyone wanted to take a photo of it. It had just the right amount of seasoning, and heat, and hit the spot without that typically lethargic feeling that hits you with vegan wraps. The banana lassi was probably one of the best milkshakes I've had in a long time.  

Even without the great service, they basically had me at milkshakes and burritos. Lunch is also very reasonably priced, especially for a vegetarian place in the city. Try them out! Noms and an instant day brightener!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. It's a small walk-in with a very simple ambiance, but the food makes this place. I'm not a vegetarian but come here when I'm downtown to get their veg-in burger, a black bean burger that is served with all the fixings and a spicy molé sauce. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"It's small, parking is a pain, but the food is good and its one of the few authentic vegetarian foodie places in Downtown Calgary."}
{"text":"We ordered a couple Brooklyn beyond meat burgers for delivery through skip the dishes. They were delivered on time and still hot. I must admit all the hype of veg-in YYC is true!  We even got the gluten free buns which I expected to be underwhelming. Boy was I ever wrong . The bun complimented the burger perfectly and it didn't have that gross after taste like most meat free and vegetarian foods I've had in the past. If you want the best meatless burger available, this is the place to go. Oh, I did forget that the burgers are quite expensive, but worth it."}
{"text":"Love the food here. Owner and employees are also very friendly.

Recommend the samosas. Nice spice with just enough heat! Best part is that most of the dishes here are vegan!!! Seems to be a rarity in Calgary."}
{"text":"This place was hands down the best vegan/vegetarian restaurant I have been to. I am a little biased, I love Indian food. Their Indian fusion is very well done without losing the integrity of the inspiration. I had the Mardi Gras Veggrito and my husband had the Hungry Possom flatbread. The Veg-In sauce is perfect, right amount of spice and flavor that highlights everything in the dish. Also bought some raw vegan cakes, and they were amazing!"}
{"text":"i am so so happy i found this place. i came during lunch hour. the prices seemed pricey since they dont come with a side but i ordered the chick pea wrap and it was huge! super filling and delicious. i will def be back here again!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan, or gluten free.  I have some vegan / gluten free friends and I live nearby so naturally I have eaten here a few times.  I have to say they are pretty decent.  Food is tasty, prepared from scratch and assembled for you to order.  Normally veggie/vegan/glutenfree spots are not my go to kinda place but Veg-In definitely hits it home for me in a lot of other ways.  If you are vegan or gluten free, this should be on your list of places to try.  Certainly not a sit down / table service place, more of a deli style eatery. 

I've eaten here quite a few times and have been satisfied every time."}
{"text":"Back in Calgary and i couldn't resist going back for a Black bean burger on Gluten Free bun. This burger is absolutely delicious, the bun is amazing and hold itself together. A new favorite take out restaurant in YYC... 

The service is great and makes me want to come back as well..."}
{"text":"Had the Millionaire smashed samosas burger with Tamarind and peanut sauce. Like being able to choose your own sauce to add to the burger  Good flavours and the right amount of heat in the samosa. Looking forward to trying something else on the menu next time im in the area."}
{"text":"Let's get something out of the way... Hi, my name is Dale and I'm a meat-atarian. I'll put back a bunch of bacon, chicken wings or burgers without any discretion. If there's a tasty animal on the table - I will eat it. Moving on.

Veg-In is fantastic! They take non-animal ingredients (vegetables, I think they call them) and create quick, delicious meals that you can eat along the sunny, street-side window bar, or take with you on your journey. The shop is casual and approachable - so, Vegans, if you'd like to introduce your non-vegan friends to your diet, Veg-In is a really great place to start. You won't need to say a single thing - Veg-In's food will do all the convincing you'll ever need.

Think of your favourite street side burrito shop, now make it way cleaner, friendlier and add house-made ingredients that you can trust. I'm more than a little hard to impress with a meal not including a good-size slab of animal protein, but when it comes to Veg-In's daily special \"veggito\", I didn't miss it at all. I'm craving another. I left so full and happy, with a smile on my face so big, I wasn't aware vegetable could create."}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better service. Lots of options...something different to try every time. More of a take out place."}
{"text":"Great place. Super fresh, super clean. Had the Millionaire Burger and the Bollywood Fantasy Veggito (Burrito). Also a mango lassi. All were excellent. This is a cute little hole in the wall place (but clean!) with food that's a blend of Indian and Vegan fusion. Yum."}
{"text":"Great Vegan food. I've had 2 occasions to drop in here. I don't work downtown so it's a bit of a hike and parking is not always readily available on 6 Ave between 1st & 2nd St SE. The prices are very reasonable. I've only tried The Wilderness which is a portabello mushroom burger. It's a messy eat but the flavours are delicious. You have a choice of sauces from house-made sriracha to chipotle. Buns are made without eggs or dairy. The menu consists of burritos, burgers and naan flatbreads and NO cheese poutines. The owner is very friendly and eager to please."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new vegetarian place to check out one evening and happened upon this one on my handy dandy yelp app (shameless plug in there, where is my endorsement money!!). Kidding. It was late, well winter late, probably 5PM and already dark enough to trick my stomach into thinking it was way past my dinner time and getting grouchy. Walking in the owners of the restaurant were mingling around, and from the looks of it helping to train a new lady at the food line. I looked around getting a sense for the place, it mostly seems like a dine out restaurant, very small with minimal seating, and with it being the dead of winter, it was chilly by the window seats. Regardless I stayed to eat; I grabbed one of the veggie burritos, and I apologize I can't remember for the life of me what it was called, but it was delicious! It was wrapped in a nice thick bread with mango, onions, and a vegan meat alternative. All the flavours were great together and was more than enough to hit my hunger. I also grabbed a slice of orange chocolate cheesecake for when I got home. I ate this later and was very satisfied, it was frozen when bought and had thawed by the time I got home. Although I wouldn't sit in again, unless during a warmer day or in the summer, the food is well prepared, the owners friendly, and you leave feeling you gave your body something truly good to eat."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch here! Healthy comfort food at its finest. I had the GF Mardi Gras wrap and my friend had one of the flatbreads. Both were delicious! Can't wait to come back and try some more menu items."}
{"text":"Went to grab lunch from this place right after we landed in Calgary. I bookmarked this restaurant as I really liked their menu and was looking forward to trying out their fusion dishes. I love indian fusion food and I came to this place with high expectations . But well, i was utterly disappointed.

We ordered samosas , classic burger & destiny awaits veggito. The samosas were good but both the veggito and burger were a disaster. While I was waiting for my order I got a chance to speak with the chef-cum-owner. She was friendly and really nice to talk to. She also warned me that their food had milder flavors compared to the conventional Indian restaurants, but i beg to differ with her. There is a huge difference between mild and bland. The food lacked flavor altogether. If you savour Indian food, this place is not for you. I couldn't even finish my burger. My husband was hungry so he just ate his veggito for the sake of it .."}
{"text":"I wish this located in a more convenient spot- with only street parking downtown, we found a lot and walked in- which was totally worth the effort.  I have heard so many awesome reviews about this place, and with the 2 items I tried, it lived up to the hype. I enjoyed the Millionaire burger which was a smashed samosa as a burger.  It was so tasty, I wish it was bigger to enjoy more, but then wouldn't be able to eat it all because the current size is already quite large - in other words, a great tasting burger with flavours that I still remember.  Um and the lassi was really delicious- I had the pineapple coconut which was thoroughly enjoyable, maybe reminded me of a piña colada.  My friend offered her thumbs up for her rose lassi and a bbq jackfruit wrap.  
When we got there, it was actually (but not surprising) quite busy with people waiting for their take away orders- it was easy to find a place to sit along the window in the tiny place with not a lot of seating all, maybe 10 stools?  As we were leaving, the rush had died down but the owner came to us and apologized for the wait and busyness- she was lovely!  
Will def return and bookmark them in my SkipTheDishes rotation."}
{"text":"One word: unctuous.  Ok, two words, unctuous and umami.  Me and hubby are both vegan and we were utterly delighted to have so many choices and options.  We tried the poutine, crispy peppered fries covered with a slightly sweet tomato and coconut gravy.  We shared a Veg-In Classic black bean burger which comes on a hearty bun with all the fixings, and a Millionaire burger which is a smashed samosa with coleslaw.  There is a big variety of (free) sauces to choose from, not only the classic ketchup, mustard, and mayo, but also tamarind sauce, peanut sauce and some more that I forget!  The owners are lovely and welcoming.  They donate 1.00 from every lassi to the Alice Farm Sanctuary, which is such a wonderful gesture.  Don't think this is rabbit food though!  Omnivores will love it too - filling, hearty, and healthy, no trace of greasiness or chemical aftertaste.  It is made with love.  I can't wait to go back or maybe even order in via skip the dishes.  What a treat!"}
{"text":"I came to Calgary for a training event, and the lodgings were near this little restuarant. Let me just say they are amazingly tastly, friendly, and accommodating to boot. They will happily tweak your order how you like.

What they offer is a vegetarian mashup of Indian street food and American fast food--naan-pased \"pizzas\", burrito-type wraps, samosas, and burgers. The burger patties are housemade (bean- or jackfruit-based) as well as the commercial Beyond Burger imitation beef, and you can get a double decker with a veggie pattie topped with a squished samosa. Just a bit messy to eat but super tasty, especially with your choice of two sauces from a long list ranging from mild to \"call the doctor\" hot. You can get gluten-free versions of most things for an extra charge.

They also have baked fries & onion rings, house-made tortilla chips of various kinds, kombucha, sodas, lassis (dairy & vegan), and vegan desserts. If you are in downtoan Calgary, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We were only in Calgary for 24 hours or so, but I wish I could come back all the time and try all of the dishes. I can say that if you're in Calgary, you have to stop here! Many of the dishes incorporate elements familiar from Indian food, but the owners/chefs have really thought of a lot of unique dishes that you won't quite find elsewhere. It's a real treat. Most everything seems to be vegan or easily made vegan. They even have vegan lassis!  

Staff was super friendly and helpful. There's some seating, although it isn't a huge space. We were able to get a place to sit during lunch on weekday."}
{"text":"THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL INDIAN RESTAURANT. A sign inside the store will tell you the same. Sehra takes classic Indian flavours and creates vegan, fusion dishes that are delicious! Everything is made to order, so it'll be as mild or as spicy as you like it. My first try, I ordered the soup/samosa/naan combo - which was perfectly filling for a light lunch. The samosa was a touch spicier than I had hoped (a 3 on the spice scale, according to Sehra) but that soup was everything I wanted on a cold day - creamy, warm (both in spice and temperature) and yummy.  Open your minds, give it a try... I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Fast food vegan friendly with Indian flavors.  Glad I came to visit. Owner is very nice and I enjoyed my matcha nut milk shake as well as the hungry possum flat bread which has potato, peas, and cauliflower on a homemade naan. Not fancy and primarily takeout.  Reasonable prices. Also had an east meets west smashed samosa which had similar flavor to the first dish and was delicious as well. They are able to adjust spice level as desired."}
{"text":"This is one of those really hip, hole-in-the-wall places that I'd love to recommend as a hidden gem. Unfortunately, I can't. I had some high hopes that this was some sort of undiscovered vegan sensation, but I felt let down. 

This is almost an Indian fusion place, sort of diner / take out style. I was passing by and wanted to grab something to go - I'm fortunate that it was empty, but even so I ended up waiting for my food for a solid 8 minutes because it was prepared at a glacial pace. 

I ended up going with the \"millionaire burger\", which consists of a smashed samosa, some coleslaw greens, and some onions in a bun. Unfortunately, the was literally just that - a sad looking bun, a samosa that was squished in, and some sad looking coleslaw greens.

For a production cost of probably $1.50, they charged me $9 - which would have been fine if I had my mind blown. 

Instead, I got a vegetarian experience that many meat eaters expect - lackluster, with no texture and little flavor. This would be the kind of lunch that I would have put together whilst living in a basement during university and having next to nothing in my pantry with a samosa I'd bought off the street (All of those things have happened, truthfully). 

I can't say that it was off-putting or gross or particularly offensive - it just lacked any sort of flavor or texture. I may as well have eaten the bun with some multivitamins. 

Unfortunately I would have no interest in returning given that Stone Bowl is around the corner for some great Korean food."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.  
Where have you been all my life?
Best gluten free bun I've ever had surrounding veggie burger bliss!!
This place is incredible!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for the first time from Veg-In. The samosas are delicious!  Good value, and travelled well. Love the sauce on the chickpeas. Will definitely order again :)"}
{"text":"I'm a vegan from San Francisco, but I fly to Calgary a lot. Recently went searching for Vegan food spots and found this cozy joint. Ordered the Millionaire with extra spiciness. The staff was very courteous and gave suggestions on sauces that work with the dish. Menu is very creative. Service is outstanding, where they offered to add condiments if I want more. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience for a rainy downtown Thursday!"}
{"text":"I came in to check out Veg-in while traveling to Banff and Glacier National Park. And that was a good decision! As a vegan in Calgary, I was not sure what I would find, but at Veg-in I founds vegan wraps, burgers, smoothies, salads and what not! Nice work by owners Mona and Manish, and their charming help- their kids as it turned out since it was labor day and the youngsters were helping out- nice to see in any mom and pop shop!

Definitely recommend this neat and clean place, conveniently located close to downtown. It has a few tables and chairs if you want to enjoy a tea or smoothie as you wait, and get a yummy to-go order! The vegan cheese sauce and green chutney sauce in the sandwich was great and I enjoyed the black bean burger as soon as I got to the airport on my way back to USA- could not wait to dig into it! Definitely check it out if you are ever in Calgary. Yay for Veg-in YYC!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite vegan friendly joints in YYC. Gluten friendly and the selections of flat breads and wraps are great! Definitely worth checking out !! Highly recommended !! Don't forget to try their samosas !! I could probably eat 100"}
{"text":"We loved this place! Sehra is the extremely passionate owner who definitely knows how to make a fabulous dish. Although this is a vegan restaurant, there were some amazing burgers and burritos on the menu. We had the amazing soup, a burger, a flatbread, some of Sehra's amazing homemade chips, naan with marmalade (omg), and finished off with some beautiful, local, raw, lavender cake. I am most certainly returning for some amazing food and look forward to enjoying Sehra's homey environment."}
