{"text":"Very nice bar. Great food. Bands play here on certain night. Good place to come and chiil and grab a beer and eat some food and watch a game."}
{"text":"We were passing through the area and found this place after searching online for bars near our hotel.   

I live in Chicago, but am originally from a small town, and this bar and bartender had a small town feel.  I could feel the bartender sizing us up as we sat down.   I felt we had to earn her kindness.    The Bulls were playing so I asked if she could change the channel to the game and she seemed kinda shaken with that request for some reason.  

We ordered the ribs, which my friend says are the best ribs she has ever eaten and I've have to agree they were pretty damn good.     We also ordered a few drinks (I had four vodka tonics to be exact) and my bill was VERY cheap at $22.00.  Yep, I'm in a small town alright!  lol

After the bartender warmed to us, she taught us how to play Keno so we spent a lot of time betting and having fun with that.  

Its a nice atmosphere.  Has a pool table, juke box, and many tvs to watch games.  All in all, a good evening.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Great place!  Food is good and prices reasonable, enjoy the fact that they are friendly. Wish they would get karaoke back."}
{"text":"The upper deck is under new ownership. They are making lots of great updates.  New furniture, new drinks, new vibe. Owners are outgoing and very friendly, and hands on. Just what the place needed.  Check them out."}
{"text":"Visited the Upper Deck for one of those fundraiser events. You know the type - you pay $20 or so for all you can eat and drink for a set amount of time. It was a pretty awful time. The speed of service at the bar was unacceptable. The place was pretty crowded for this event but the bartenders did not have the sense of urgency that they should have had - moving slowly and spending a lot of time conversing with people sitting at the bar is why I say this. Also, they were constantly out of the food. I may visit the place again when its slower but I will definitely without a doubt skip the next fundraiser they host. I've seen a lot of places do fundraising right and Upper Deck wasn't even close."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service from the bar staff. They all looked lost like it was their first day. Took over 30 mins for 2 orders of wings. Also, my second Blue Moon was magically $0.25 more expensive than my first one... Will never come back."}
{"text":"The girls in my sorority were obsessed with this place, but I just never understood it.  I think it may or may not have something to do with the fact that they're pretty laid back with IDing.  I did have a few fun college nights here, especially for 21st birthdays (I always wondered if the bartenders noticed that the newly 21-year-old had drank there before).  There's a pretty equal mix of Berea townies and college kids here.  It's good for a Cavs or Indians game, never too crowded and a very laid back atmosphere.  A bunch of my sorority members who are dedicated \"regulars\" of this bar were recently added to the giant montage painting of people's faces on the wall, which I thought was pretty cool!"}
{"text":"I was here with a group of work friends and we had a great time. The service was average, but the band was great. I'm not usually a fan of live music since it makes it hard to converse with friends but the level was perfect here. My group was happy with the Keno machine, too as we're all addicted. 
I didn't get a chance to try the food so I can't comment there. 
This is one of those local joints where you're likely to see the same regulars and may even see their faces on the wall mural. I actually recognized the owner from when I used to frequent this place years ago before they expanded. Love to visit a place where I can say 'remember when.' I'll go back :)"}
{"text":"Anywhere that serves PBR on draft isnt all bad in my book. Especially for $1.75 a pint!
For a friday night it was pretty empty, and the cover band they had on stage was busting out the standard \"middle aged crowd\" music (alice and chains, pearl jam etc)
by time we got there (11:30 ish) everyone was pretty well intoxicated.. which held high entertainment value for a people watching enthusiast such as myself.
Kind of boring, but we usually have no problem entertaining ourselves."}
