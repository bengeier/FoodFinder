{"text":"Excellent service. Food was awesome!!!! The camarones borrachos and the molcajete were delicious!  Came all the way from Oakland, Oakland has very tasty Mexican food and this place is very close. I highly recommend to try this place out."}
{"text":"Delicious food great service muy bien ambiente aquí en Las Vegas. Definitely will return again."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican cuisine. Attentive service. Cold beer. Extensive menu with concentration on seafood dishes. \"I'll be back\"."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place on a recommendation from Yelp and couldn't wait to return to get the signature dish (combo) and salsa. I've tried to find other places back home in the Midwest and nothing compares. It's also extremely roomy and clean."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! This restaurant is quite a hole in the wall but is extremely authentic. Make sure you try the molcajetes (meat/chicken/seafood/ or combo), ceviche, chicken fajitas and  the mole.  If you just order standards like the enchiladas or tacos you may not be as impressed. Salsa and chips are also wonderful."}
{"text":"Mi familia y yo tenemos como 8 años visitando este maravilloso lugar ...muy buena comida y servicio...claro algunas veces hemos tenido que esperar un poco pero bien vale la pena ...:-)"}
{"text":"When you go to a restaurant and you say... \"the best from here was the salsa\" should definitely tell you everything... -caldo de rest was not fresh.... -tortila chips are not home made.... -agua de pina is from a machine not home made."}
{"text":"I stopped in here because I've heard a few people talk about the great seafood they have and it has a great yelp review. I sat with my daughter and chips and salsa were dropped right away. I ordered two waters waited 15 mins and finally asked the lady walking by if somebody would please take my order. She responded yes and walked away, needless to say I got up and left. I did however get a balloon flower for my daughter while I was waiting so only one of us left unhappy. I've worked in the service industry for 20 years and I understand busy, but when Im watching some of the girls texting on their phones instead of working it's unacceptable."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in town. The original Molcajetes in Las Vegas. After them other restaurants try to copy their style.. They have failed. Los Molcajetes is legit. Family friendly. One of a kind."}
{"text":"It's soo good here! Tiny place but HUGE flavor. It does get pretty packed on the weekends but so worth the wait!"}
{"text":"You have to get here for the experience as fast as you can. Order the combo house special and an ice cold beer and tip the mariachi."}
{"text":"I have to say the food is really delicious!  but a bit pricey on the seafood for my taste. I love the atmosphere service is great I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Skeptical because of the high reviews but the food and service was great. Price was reasonable and portions were big. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"The signature dish is killer! It was bustling and lively in the joint. I will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"This place seem a lot dirtier then I remember food wasnt as good I wont be back"}
{"text":"Good food, great pork green chile on my last visit! Will be back again soon and you should go by there sometime and check it out"}
{"text":"This is one of the very best authentic Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas.  If you want average Mexican food, do not come here!  The fish ceviche is extraordinary as is all the seafood.  The service from the staff is impeccable and the prices are reasonable.  They have an excellent selection of Mexican beers as well.  If you like excellent authentic Mexican food, do yourself a favor and visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Please don't go... horrible food. Fui con mi esposa y las tortillas están crudas y la comida está fría y sin sabor..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is what I would say is very authentic tasting food with the right balance of flavor and heat. I had to order the signature dish and I was not disappointed....The Molcajeta come out ripping hot.. it was explained to me in english and spanish since when I go to spanish speaking establishment they are not to sure which languages to speak... either way is ok with me and the occasional spanglish... The dish will feed two people for sure. The seating was a little tricky it was Sunday and it was packed the mariachi group was playing and families where waiting to be seated but after about ten minutes of waiting I was seated. I am sure if you go early you can avoid this type of situation..The staff was really helpful with getting pople in and out.  If you are in Las Vegas and enjoy venturing out beyond the buffets....This is the place for authentic flavor of Mexico...."}
{"text":"Waitresses are fantastic with nice personalities! They look awesome of course, but they serve the customers with great service, even though it may be busy. The food tastes delicious! I had the Mole with Chicken and it reminded me of the time when I stayed down in Rancho Los Pinos in Baja California Sur 20 years ago. I still remember that Chicken Mole dish and hadn't found any that came close until when I visited this restaurant. The place is cozy and busy with families, etc. I will be returning to this place when I came back to Vegas in the future."}
{"text":"Ole!  Holy frijoles Batman!  Recently had the opportunity to pick up food here for a work function, and this was the first time I truly embraced the word gringo...because that's exactly what I was, the only gringo in the house, and that's also how I also knew I was I for a treat!  This food was going to be as authentic as it gets and it truly was!  If you are ever in the mood for some authentic Mexican food, head on down and give this place your business because I guarantee you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Molcajetes as authentic as the Mayan calendar. Food served on a molcajete, a grinding tool made from volcanic rock, the same kind the Mayans and Aztecs used for thousands of years back can only prove the authenticity of the cookware and of the scheme. The mariachi band playing loud music, vendors coming in and out of the restaurant selling DVDs and CDs and other stuff can only prove the authenticity of the atmosphere.   My eyes were fooled, my ears were convinced but  my taste buds, the toughest one of my senses, are the only one that can conclude authenticity.  We started with an order of raw oysters, juicy and chewy with some tapatio and lime, paired with a michelada and I was instantly a fan. The molcajete mixto with steak chicken and shrimp, sizzling exploding like a volcano with south of the border flavors sealed the deal, it was real mexican food and this Mexican was happy!   I will definitely return if only for the raw oysters, everything here taste amazing and the service is equally awesome there's nothing here that doesn't scream authentic! ...except the little umbrellas that decorate the servings...those are made in China. You go now!!"}
{"text":"Wow amazing food amazing service. Our waitress Natalie was so nice and helpful she made me feel so welcomed. I had such a nice time. I will be coming again. We order the combination molcagete and el cocktail de camarón. It was so delicious, mouth watering. The food was still boiling when the brought out the molcagete."}
{"text":"Great delicious Molcajetes Mixto, you must try Chavelita beer. great price and customer service."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Las Vegas! No yellow cheese, gringo-mex here. Just be sure you have cash, they don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"Excelente servicio y la comida deliciosa, el molcajete fue muy buena opción, gracias a Nancy la mesera que nos recomendó el molcajete ranchero!!"}
{"text":"Just flew in from San Diego and the first text I get when we land is, \"I hope you guys are hungry!\" All my cousin can talk about is this amazing mexican place we have to try. He seemed to be over selling the place for about two hours. After we finally get our appetites we head over. We start with chips and salsa and it's good.  Spicy and delicious. Then the molcajetes come out and damn. There's beef chicken and shrimp in this amazing sauce in this boiling stone bowl. With sides of beans rice and guacamole and fresh tortillas. Two big bowls was enough for all four of us. If you have not been here you need to go. The service was good and the food was super tasty. I could not keep from pigging out. They really need to expand to san diego."}
{"text":"I had the coltel de camaron and on the side I also ordered 2 tostada de ceviche thinking I wasn't going to be full. And boy was I wrong I was stuffed. When my tostadas came out I couldn't believe how big they were  I'm used to getting little ones and this was big. They put alot of ceviche!  Worth the money. I've never been here since I'm from az and I had a good experience"}
{"text":"Bomb food. Great service. Definitely be coming back soon  Comida rica. Buen servicio. Si regresaria"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is delicious. Their Molcajetes are the best, especially the chicken one. Their staff are very nice."}
{"text":"Yelp comes thru again.........  The prawn/octopus ceviche was perfect and incredibly fresh. For $5.50 it was such a great deal because there was a large portion. Their chef has a special way with pulpo, it was just so perfectly prepared and tender. Only thing it needed was more aquacate and we ordered that.  We also tried their famous molcajete with chicken and it is obvious they have a unique cooking method as this is breast meat yet so soft and moist even without any of their wonderful red chile sauce which is using similar chili's as used in enchilada chili puree. Overall it is a great dish and stays hot so long cause of the hot molcajete (be careful not to burn yourself).  Our waitress Karen was as good as it gets, friendly and knowledgeable about the food. Overall one of the best Mexican restaurants serving authentic food I have eaten at.......and we eat a ton of great Mexican food in Oakland and the bay area so easy to compare."}
{"text":"This is probably the best and most traditional Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. The service was exemplary, the atmosphere was warm and very Mexican.  The food, my friends was amazing. The \"Los Molcajetes\"  combo plate arrived at the table sizzling hot, stuffed with amazingly tasting food and the presentation is worthy of a clean 5 stars. If you are into traditional Mexican food done with pride give this off the strip joint a try. Cannot go wrong here. They even have the menu in Mexican but with photos , which adds to the authenticity. There is also a mariachi band that can sing at your table ! Misconceptions aside , if you ought to have real Mexican food but the kind that it's done and presented well above your \"Don Jose\" restaurant try here. Make Taco Bell and the Pollo Locco look illegal."}
{"text":"Wanted some authentic Mexican food while in Vegas. This place was recomended and was as good as we were told. My wife and my two kids went and we all had different dishes, all was excellent. We had ceviche, campechana (seafood coxktail) carne asada huarache and chicken enchiladas with green sauce. Servings were big and service was great. Saw alot of molcajetes served at other tables, will try them next time we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food.  Mexican music and mariaxhis that sporadically come in.  What else can one want?  My favorite is the Molcajete Do Macho.  Good for two people.  Never disappoints.   We come here every time we visit Vegas"}
{"text":"a little out of the way for me. met a friend for lunch. I had no idea what the menu had so she ordered the combination.  it was wonderful!  well more then enough to feed a family of 4!"}
{"text":"Micheladas here are perfect! Must try.  The food is good but nothing exciting. It's your typical Mexican restaurant. However, I appreciate that they aren't stingy with their chicken on the enchiladas, tostadas, or sopes. Loved the flavor of the chicken too!   I'm giving them 4 stars because I ordered Guacamole and they didn't bring it out and the server seemed all over the place."}
{"text":"Food was awesome, I had the torta!! Pure bombness.... Overall I'd say I would definitely come here again.."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! We ordered oysters for our appetizer. I had enchiladas they're were good. My hubby ordered the ceviche and they pile on the shrimp! I'll def be back!"}
{"text":"YES, I was gettin my BROWN on.....          I came here after a long day of doing a whole bunch yard work. The sun had set and I was thinking about my mama and her deliciously comforting cooking...ah, but I am so lazy after busting my back en la yarda...what ever shall I do?? -----it's a good thing Los Molcajetes is JUST around the corner from my place (Hey, and for those of you Downtown looking for a fun environment to grab some Mexican food---come on down, I say).   I would personally say the food is overpriced or more a $$$ than a $$ BUT it is DAMN good. There are some specials that would fit their price description but if you want an entree or anything seafood- you're gonna be looking at a hungry check later.   Being a Latina I was raised having some very delicious food both inland and on the coastline, so If you are used to having some coastline food time in Mexico done right- THIS is your place!!  The environment is SO MUCH FUN. Next time I check in I will do the spot more justice so STAY TUNED! The place is completely painted and decked out with ocean life style kinds of things- which is SUCH a comforting thing given that we are all located in between two valleys/the desert. Dive in at the best ocean themed #divein north of #downtown."}
{"text":"Comida no tan buena, los ostiones son congelados y abiertos puestos en cáscaras lavadas...  servicio 2-3 m, no vuelvo a este lugar...."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since early 2000's...I knew the old lady that started opened this....when in Vegas this place is a must!!! Best authentic food in las vegas and I mean authentic....Mariachi on the weekends and the michelada are great...LOVE THIS PLACE.....Alambre de Pollo is my dish"}
{"text":"La chavela michelada was very delicious. It had clams, shrimp and cucumbers. I had the steak plate and it was very good as well. Beans were on point."}
{"text":"Cant believe horrible service and food awful nothing is fresh taste like garbage need better products the lettuce salad like 4 days old ne c er coming back"}
{"text":"After being there many times before Our experience  the last time I was there, it was unpleasant and  awkward,  it seemed like our server was bothered by our presence."}
{"text":"I went here after school with my friends today. I didn't know what to think at first, but this place is super yummy. They give you chips and salsa as soon as you walk in and tbh the salsa is VERY spicy. Especially for people with low tolerance(me). I had a pork taco and it was delicious. The pork was cooked well and it comes with a lot of seasonings. For dessert we had a burrito cheesecake and it was pretty bomb. It was really hot on the inside and covered in a strawberry sauce."}
{"text":"Everything tastes great but my favorite is the molcajete ....the service is great and it's clean"}
{"text":"First time good service- good food : second and last time service was TERRIBLE!! Food was TERRIBLE!"}
{"text":"The quality and size was impressive. Rustic and delicious. I had the combo molcajete. Handmade tortillas. I am a cook and consumer. The service was fast and friendly with beautiful smiles. Thanks Natalie. You got to check out this place if you are a real Mexican food aficionado."}
{"text":"I have been here four times and our last lunch here was the best service I have had in a long time.  The highlights have been the salsa, beans and of couse the molcajetes.  We have had great, authentic food here every visit and the service has been outstanding!"}
{"text":"Whoa, stop hard at Owens and N Eastern Blvd.  This place ROCKS!  I read reviews and thought it sounded like one of those out of the way gems.  But when I got there was afraid it was one of the decorated up Mexican joints that looked all spiffy with fancy decor and paint colors.  And then served you something that was just okay meh that left you feeling like it was almost good enough to go back but was lacking.  Wow, I let the waitress tell me what was her favorite... still not sure exactly what it was but ticket shows Camerones Chipo, waitress told me it was very very hot.  She came back 3 times to ask me 'Are you sure it is okay.'  Dam near licked the plate clean but thought that might show my lack of class when eating!!  Sopped up every drop of sauce with those killer tortillas they served!!!  Beans excellent, rice done just right, even chips and salsa (with lots of tomatillos and I normally don't like tomatillos) were great.  Then the waitress almost topped the main course, some cheese burrito that had been deep fried that rocked as well.  Left wanting to turn around and go in and reorder exactly the same thing!!!!  Now thats a meal when you want to hurt yourself by having an immediate repeat when you are already waddling out the door.  Last night it was an $80 prime rib, shrimp appetizer and tiramasu at supposedly one of the best steakhouses downtown that left that shoulda been good meh feeling.  Tonight it was $17.00 camerones and cheese burrito for desert that ROCKS.  Wish I was going to be here longer would go back again.  The only thing that I want different is for the chef not to tone down the heat for the white gringo, (loved the waitress she was so concerned she was going to hurt the lightweight).  Now that is taking care of the customer.  And it was spicy enough to know that it could be serious heat and still have awesome flavor.  Waitress promised if I come back it would be the real thing for the gringo.  Killer food, awesome service and would go back in a heartbeat.  Thanks Los Molcajetes I doubt you can find many places with more flavor in their food in LV, celebrity chefs included."}
{"text":"Super busy during dinner, come early, but it's worth it!! So delicious. Staff treat you right; never seems to be in bad spirits. The food was delicious. I would come more often if I lived on that side of town. I'd say it's a dive, but whatever, food was BOMBtastic."}
{"text":"This is some of the better Americanized Mexican food in Vegas. Their house specialties are their enchiladas which are very very good, I usually go for the shrimp ones which are packed full of good sized shrimp.  Always friendly and helpful staff. Plus you can't beat their free chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Bam! Don't even get me started. If you are like me and literally just crave spice you need as in rt now drop everything NEED to go here. I speak un poco Spanish so I had to ask for an English menu, even then my total and utter whiteness was evident. Our server was adorable and thankfully recommended what they are known for, the Molcajetes! Do it do it do it! So delicious, so reasonable, soo wish I could swing by today!  Update: I live in Summerlin, this place is an epic drive yet I still find myself jumping on the freeway for my Ceviche fix. After a few unsuccessful local Mexican visits I've decided to just accept this place is the only place for me. When friends come in from Cali, there is where we go.  The service is 100%, the salsa and chips are delicious, the white fish in the ceviche is fresh, chunky, and seasoned absolutely perfectly. My kids love their burritos and quesadillas.  As for the vendors who walk by with a smile offering you their goods? Totally respectful, and not something at all that is annoying or inappropriate in this legit Mexican restaurant.   If you want to pay 12 bucks for a single poorly made tostada or burrito go somewhere more glamorous. If you want real Mexican food, in a nice low key environment, that is super affordable? Head here."}
{"text":"Awesome and amazing food! Great environment with an affordable price. Family and traditional Mexican party style restaurant! Greatly recommend it! The ranchero molcajete is amazing! With beef short ribs, chicken steaks, chorizo sausage, nopal and queso fresco in a molcajete sizzling straight out the oven!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican restaurant in LAS VEGAS. Being of Mexican decent, I grew up eating Mexican food made by my mother who was a superb cook in her own right, so I have something to compare to. I rate a restaurant on the food, everything else is just filler. The neighborhood is older & mainly Mexican. This place is my favorite Mexican restaurant in all of the Las Vegas Valley. I have recommended it to all my friends.                                                                                                                                                                          First of all you get the requisite chips & salsa. One can order the signature dish of either chicken, beef, the combo which is chicken, beef, & shrimp,  or the seafood combo which has shrimp & octopus. In the same bowl you also get roasted peppers, nopales (cactus), lime wedge, radish (not turnips), a square of Queso cotija, a slice of tomato, slice of avocado & grilled mexican onions. Everything is covered in a superb red sauce. They all taste excellent and come served piping hot in the namesake Molecajeta, the stone vessel made of volcanic rock shaped like a bowl. You get more than enough tortillas to eat with. You can eat fajita style by putting the ingredients of choice in a tortilla or use the tortilla to eat straight out of the Molecajeta. There is an enormous amount of food for one to eat. In fact i've yet  to finish an entire meal in one seating. I always take some home for later. The staff is very friendly & helpful. The menu comes in English & Spanish for the Spanish challenged amongst us.  There are other choices on the menu beside the above mentioned. My son prefers the tacos, be it fish, carne asada, or carnitas. The have seafood also on the menu which is also excellent. They serve beer & soda. On weekends they have roving musicians that play mexican music for money. There are also vendors who can be annoying at times selling CD's, DVD's & various trinkets. Just tell them no & they will leave you alone. Cash is king here. Don't forget to tip."}
{"text":"Went by there today to grab some food to go since I was passing by.  I ordered a carne burrito and two chicken tacos.  The burritos are more like what they eat in mexico.  The beans were pretty good and the meat had pretty good flavor. The chicken was tacos were bland as heck.  I'll re-review this place when I try the molcajetes since that is what they are known for.   Oh yeah, bring cash, no check or cc."}
{"text":"The food here is authentic Mexican food. The style is rustic and portion sizes are large. This is a good place to enjoy a casual dinner with the family and you won't break the bank.   Be prepared for the loud live entertainment courtesy of the mariachi band.   The tortilla chips are not homemade but if you can move past that, the food is well prepared and delicious. Their signature dish is served in a molcajete (or stone mortar). Two people can easily eat from one molcajete. Their other dishes are great too. Try the mole... it's sweet and chocolatey at first but then leaves a bit of heat after. Great development of flavor!"}
{"text":"Awesome Molcejetes!! Salsa is also bomb. Chaveles are out of this world good. One of my Vegas favorites."}
{"text":"I was seriously disappointed today. This was my favorite place to go eat authentic Mexican food. First of all, it was too dim and hot inside that it was just ridiculous. I don't know if their a/c wasn't working at all or what but it was too dam hot in there. Once we sat down, they had a group playing and it was just hard for the waitress to take our order. We literally had to yell out our order to her. When it was time for our food to come out, she gave us PLASTIC utensils. Never in my life have I gone to a restaurant where they serve you plastic utensils UNLESS it's a fast food restaurant. On to the food...I had ordered a Carne Asada plate. The meat wasn't even RANCHERA it was BISTEC. The fries were old and the rice was hard. The service wasn't the best. I was just completely disappointed."}
{"text":"We all went there at the request of my boss. Good Lord, I ate way too much. The food was great! I have no complaints. They go out of their way to go putside of the box and add some truely aithentic touches. It's a must try!!'"}
{"text":"So far the best Mexican place in Vegas!!! It gets crowded fast but it's worth the wait. I always get the flautas! Soooo good. I come here every weekend practically!"}
{"text":"Los Molcajetes is a hole in the wall Mexican restaurant that is off the hook!!!  A Molcajete rock filled with your choice between Chicken, Beef, or Seafood w/onions and tomato broth.... Soooo good.  One Molcajete can feed at least two people.  The service is quick and the food is amazing from the tacos/burritos to the signature Molcajetes.  This place is a gem hidden in the valley and deserves your appetite."}
{"text":"El lugar perfecto para comer en familia, la comida muy rica y la atención estupenda.  Recomiendo ampliamente a los molcajetes restaurante familiar."}
{"text":"Wow!! Get the combo molcajete! If you're a fan of meaty goodness. That is the one to go!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it!  Complimentary chips and salsa was good. Salsa was thin in a good way and not overly tomato-y. Packed a great heat punch and was enhanced by a bright cilantro flavor.  The carne asada burrito was a big as my head and covered in a tangy, spicy green tomatillio sauce. The meat was well seasoned and tasty. Only thing I didn't care for was the beans and rice inside the burrito but I'll know next time to order it without (would no doubt result in a smaller burrito which I might then be able to finish).  Plate includes not only the usual lettuce garnish but also sliced radishes and a generous hunk of avocado.  Bright and cheerful inside. Parking is somewhat limited - I had no problem but I visited for a late lunch.  Some reviews mentioned cash only but I had no problem using my debit card.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"THE BEST MICHELADA. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Go get one. Then another."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love how fresh and delicious there oysters are. I wasn't to impressed with their shrimp cocktail its not too bad but i had have better, however,  everything else is delicious. I will continue to go there."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food.  The more authentic... the better.  Hole-in-the-wall?  Great!   Nobody speaks a lick of English?  Perfect!  C grade from the health dept?  As long as the food tastes good and I don't get sick!  So when some of my Mexican friends invited me to dinner at Los Molcajetes on Eastern, I figured I would feast as if I was south of the border.    When I walked in, I thought the ambience was decent.  Servers were friendly and the chips & salsa were really good.  I ordered a Corona and was disappointed that the beer wasn't that cold.  My friends ordered what they called Mexican Cola, which is basically Coke bottled in glass bottles in Mexico.    They had several TV's on Hispanic channels that were blaring so loud we could hardly talk.    We ordered an appetizer dish of mini tacos that were covered in shredded lettuce, sliced avocados, and piled high with Mexican cheese.  This was delicious!!!  I told the server that I wanted to order the dish that they were famous for and she recommended the Molcajetes, which I later learned was basically the bowl that it was served in.  For $7 it was a bargain.  The actual meal was okay.  A bowl that was filled with everything but the kitchen sink.  Beef, chicken, shrimp, grilled green onions, avocado, tomatoes... all drenched in a spicy sauce.  It was okay.  Perhaps more suitable for sharing because it was huge.  For $17, not bad considering it would've fed 2+.    During our meal, some guy started walking around with a stack of bootleg dvd's selling them for $5 each.  Odd.  Haha.    As we finished our meal, a mariachi band asked each table if they wanted a song.  If you pay them, they stand around your table playing music so loud that you can't even hear yourself think.    I felt that the restaurant was a real miss.  Nothing was special except for what they do for birthday celebrations.  They bring out a sombrero and put it on the birthday customer and sing to them.  They have a tambourine going and clap really loud.  At the end of the song, the guys in the kitchen scream and blow on that loud, obnoxious vuvuzela horn that they blow at soccer games.    I won't be back.  They seem to do very well so don't let my review keep you from trying it for yourself.  It's worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"Definitivo 5 estrellas y les pudiera dar más. El lugar está escondido y algo fuera de lo que espera una de Vegas Boulevard, pero la comida definitivo no he probado algo así en mucho tiempo ni en Los Ángeles de vvd el cocinero se esmera. Buenisimoooo"}
{"text":"I'm somewhat on a mission to find the best micheladas in Las Vegas and this place didn't disappoint. They serve a cerveza preparada called a Chavela which is a michelada but with baby clams and shrimp added. I like, I like!!  Their shrimp ceviche was really good and the service was on point!"}
{"text":"Not bad !! Food was ok but takes a long time to come out, strawberry margarita very strong and good, aguachiles ok torta of carnitas ok, well i will comeback, but somehow the ambient is a lil quietly and dark , service could be better."}
{"text":"Food was good.. fried fish kind of small but what do you expect when ur in the middle of the desert. .the menudo was very very good...waitresses are very helpfull and keep checking up to see if everything was good...it was to early to drink beer ...my only issue i had is that one of the waitress ... not the waitress that was helping us.......was chewing gum mexican style... i was waiting for her to pop it while she walked.."}
{"text":"This is my favorite  authentic mariscos spot in Vegas.  The food is fresh and the portions are huge.  I highly recommend  the cocktail campechana and the mixed tostada."}
{"text":"This was a good place to start my trip. The Michelada was on point and the food was out in no time. The music was an added bonus because what goes better a meal than Willie Colon blasting in the background. Awesome, awesome place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting and heading to our hotel when we thought about mariscos and couldn't find anything around good around the hotel, till he found this restaurant a bit far out of the strip and it was 9:00p almost closing time. So we rushed over made it by 9:30. Even tho it was closing time all the girls were nice and welcoming. We had order the beers with shrimp, ceviche, and oysters which is so good. We were going to order more but just with that we were full. I cant wait till next time we visit Las Vegas and have some bomb cops loca and actually have a delicious looking Molcajete."}
{"text":"The Molcajetes was amazing!! Not the nicest place and not very cheap but I can't complain about the food."}
{"text":"Everything is great here! I absolutely love it, and I'm never disappointed!! Service is awesome, the food is even better. Salsa is full of taste... Spicy!! Try a molcajete, their specialty.. It's so delicious, you'll be drooling for one the rest of the week. Mariachi on Saturday and Sundays too!!! I can't imagine saying anything else to build up this place!! DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Bar environment. You get what you pay for. Slow service when crowded but its worth the wait"}
{"text":"This place is frigging AWESOME! The food is to DIE for.   Be advised: this is a serious DIVE. The floor was filthy, the tables came from the thrift store, the music was deafening... I checked out the kitchen, though, and it was SPOTLESS!  Not a bit of the \"dive\" atmosphere mattered the moment I bit into my sope. The chicken was juicy, seasoned to perfection and delish. The tortillas of my enchilada were slightly sweet and buttery. And the refried beans and rice were LEGIT!!!  Hardly anyone speaks English (staff or patrons), and the menu only has cursory translations (but lots of pictures). It doesn't matter - everyone is ridiculously friendly and patient!  Know this: this is serious DOWN HOME, abuela's cocina,  shut up and tuck in, kind of food. Nothing fancy, just a super-authentic, meat-and-rice kind of joint. Definitely the best Mexican kitchen food I've had in YEARS, and definitely the most authentic I've had in Vegas.  You must eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Had Cinco de Mayo dinner here. Quickly found a parking space. No host, just seat yourself. Served chips n Salsa within 30 seconds n quickly greated. Offered drinks. Loved the Modelo Michalada with spicy salt. Gr8 seafood options n other suggestions. I enjoyed the Mojara frita (deep fried fish). Also bought 5 bootleg DVD's n yes, they all work n have both English n Spanish language options. Had a nice Mariachi band playing. Basic ambience. Clean n very modern bathroom. Had a push button to flush. Never seen one before.   I hate leftovers but I actually finished them the following morning. They also gave my daughter some funny occasion glasses n a lollipop. Gr8 family run restaurant."}
{"text":"Although Los Molcajetes is about Molcajetes I must say they have a wide selection of seafood dishes at this spot. I didn't get a molcajete because I wasn't all that hungry and they looked pretty big. Let me say this ...NO dish at this restaurant is small, I got a taco and it had enough meat for 3 tacos in one.   Some takeaways from my Sunday dinner...  FOOD:  I wouldn't order the carne asada taco again, not because of the size, but the flavor wasn't there for me. Same with my tostada, it was tasty not the best I've had but it did the trick. I'd recommend this restaurant for a large party because they serve big hearty portions and are reasonably priced.   CUSTOMER SERVICE: Not the worst but honestly couldn't really ask my waitress for salt because there was loud mariachi playing non-stop. I love music and all but it became irritating, I couldn't hear what anybody at my table was saying. If your trying to go somewhere quiet on Sunday this isn't the spot!  Lol  Would I go back? Probably not, there's so many other restaurants that I feel offer better flavor and more variety."}
{"text":"I give this place 1000 stars!!!! Went to Las Vegas for the weekend to celebrate my birthday with friends and we came across this amazing restaurant. Amazing customer service the girl was a sweetheart, caring and with a big smile on her face l. The food is to die for if you are looking for mariscos this is the place to go!!! It's cheap fresh and amazing!!! Highly recommend this place!!! Will definitely come back! !!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Food is great. The music is always loud, if you like that, and apparently most customers do, because it's always loud."}
{"text":"after seeing all the rave reviews about los molcajetes, we had been wanting to try this place for a while and finally got the chance as we happen to be on that side of town on sunday evening.  the building is not much to look at from the outside, looks kind of like it used to be a house and the parking is very limited, but once we got past that, we were greeted with warm welcoming smiles, chips and salsa and the sounds of live mariachis!! my husband and i ordered the molcajte macho (i think is what its called) which was a combo dish to share and i HAD to have a ceviche tostada (shrimp), since ceviche is one of my favorites... im so glad we shared bc the portions are huge!!! our molcajete had shrimp, grilled chicken, carne asada, nopalitos, avocado, grilled grn onions, grilled tomato, grilled jalapeños and some spicy green salsa with cilantro that was soooo spicy & flavorful!! the best part about it was that the molcajete (lava-rock bowl) that the food was served in, kept the food piping hot while on our table!! what a great concept!! our server was nice and we had an overall great experience! we even had food to bring home left over... will go back forsure!!"}
{"text":"Bring cash.They don't take cards. Molcajetes is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.  Lindo Michoacan, Faustos, and Agave can't compare because they don't have the Molcajete. From what I understand, Molcajete means volcano in Spanish. This restaurant's signature dish, \"the Molcajete,\" is served in a black, heavy volcanic rock that looks like the mortar, as in a mortar and pestle (that you pound herbs with). The rock keeps the meat moist and it's decorated with tasty fillings for a fajita. My favorite amongst the fillings is the roasted cactus which looks like a green pepper. They also serve this with big chunks of Mexican cheese--the white, crumbly stuff.  I always order the chicken molcajete without the red sauce because I'm prone to heartburn. One order provides two meals, easy.   Molcajetes is kid friendly. There's a jukebox loaded with Spanish music that bumps pretty loudly at night. Do not buy the DVDs from the kids that offer them out of their book bags."}
{"text":"This place is authentic as they come!! The food, service, and prices are fabulous!!! The house salsa is addictive and to die for!!!  I recommend the fish ceviche and the bistec ranchero - the bomb!!! Buen provecho!!!"}
{"text":"We came here when visiting Vegas. Service was great. Everyone was super friendly and attentive.   I didn't care for all the vendors coming in to ask if we wanted to purchase something. Felt like I was back in Cabo.   The food was really good. The fresh ceviche was tasty. Great flavor and very very fresh. We had no complaints from anyone in our party of 11.  It is in a rough area of town but don't let that scare you. Totally worth giving it a try."}
{"text":"The moment i parked and could hear the mariachi band.. I knew the food would be amazing. The complementary chips and salsa was even great! I was addicted to the salsa -its tangy and slightly spicy(for me) but the heat built up as you ate more. I ordered shrimp ceviche and got the mocajete.which is actually a lot of food.please order the mocajete it is bubbly and hot and all the meat and vegetables create such an amazing harmony of flavor. Super delicious    The menu is like 98% Spanish but has tons of pictures.Sooo it was a great thing i paid a lot attention in Spanish class.lol. If you are worried you are bot a Spanish speaker the waitresses speak English and Spanish.   You do sit yourself and i do have to say that although the service is very friendly- my waitress was very disorganized. At first i gave her some slack with the deafening music in background bug It turned to forgetting small things to totally forgetting my table. As my dad would put it,\"she was the type of waitress that did a lot of things at once but accomplish nothing.\"this is the reason im giving this a four."}
{"text":"the food is very good we were there on saturday around 8pm but the waitress was all over the place, giving us the wrong plates in fact she did not even gave it to us left the drinks and plaes at the table and we have to pass them around, she turn around and went t another table, we were so tursty and we waited, when we turned around to see where the waitress was, they were all at the front talking, we than ask for salsa, nothing i had to go and ask for it to the cashier, thats the only thing it was bad, the service very bad. we ask for the manager and there is no manager at night, desapointed."}
{"text":"Was looking for a Mexican restaurant that was serving breakfast & Yelped & Googled Los Molcajetes! We were visiting from Phoenix, AZ & this place did Not disappoint! We saw other places ratings & pics... but Los Molcajetes won! My husband & I didn't get the breakfast as planned. We got tostada mixta w/tostada on the side. My husband got the fish ceviche w/tostada on the side. Portions were Huge! And besides it being huge... Good! Then my husband ordered a \"Agua mineral preparada\" & OMG that was delicious! I don't drink mineral water but damn the way this was prepared was bomb! I then ordered a quesadilla & that was soooo good! The place is small but homie. Live \"norteño\" music. This place did not disappoint & is unforgettable! Good place, good food, good prices & good music! Unforgettable."}
{"text":"04-26-14  Yummy food. Large portions. Friendly service. Clean. I had the tostada ceviche mixta. It was \"muy grande!\" I initially ordered two, thankfully she only brought one. It was huge.  My wife had the molcajete res. it was very big, and yummy.     I don't get why people on here complain that a Mexican restaurant is like a Mexican restaurant. It's not Taco Bell. The sign says authentico , so expect loud music, especially if there are mariachis that night. There were none on my visit.  To the complaints about not taking credit cards, there are old looking visa/MasterCard stickers on the doors. I used my card. I am not sure what the deal with that is."}
{"text":"Cash is King.  Was turned on to Los Mocajetes by a friend.  It's a quick drive from my work so it turns out to be my go to spot for a nice lunch.  Spanish and English menu, pretty straight forward.  They don't try to flood their offerings with BS filler items, they go straight to their featured item as the first thing listed.  The Molcajetes (volcanic pot) is basically a mexican mixed grill served in a warmed pot.  You get a protein along with some roasted tomato sauce, some veggies, edible cactus stripes, and some mexican cheese.  Your protein can be chicken, beef, shrimp, octopus, pork rib.  My wife loves the Shrimp and Octopus Molcajete, the Beef is what does it for me.  I've also tried their tacos, enchiladas, and quesadillas.  Surprisingly the quesadillas are pretty good."}
{"text":"After reading a review in one of the alternative newspapers, I had to give this place a try.  I had the chicken/beef combo molcajetes.  It was superb!  The place is a small bungalow-like building with parking in the front and sides.  It's in a small commercial area, but it's a stand alone building.  The tables have 5 or 6 bottles of different hot sauces you can try.  It seemed like that had one waitress for Spanish speaking people and one for gabachos like me.    Give this place a try!  You won't regret I'll be back to try more soon."}
{"text":"In my humble opinion( Not really, after trying tons of Mexican restaurants), I think this restaurant is the best value considering taste, price, and authenticity. I really have tried tons of Mexican Restaurant, but when I am craving cheap and OUTSTANDING Mexican food, I always end up back at Los Molcajetes. What makes them so great?  REAL MEXICAN FOOD. I am very picky about Mexican as I am Mexican and it takes a lot for me to go out and buy Food that I can otherwise have at home. The taste is exceptional, service is fantastic, and price is just great.  Me and my gf where there on Jan 1st and this what we had:  has  1) 6 oysters with Shrimp Ceviche  2) Carne Asada Torta  3) Wet Burrito with Salad 4) 2 Drinks 5) Chips and Salsa( twice)  6) Cheese Cake Burrito   TOTAL: 24 bucks!   We will definitely stop by again sometime soon!   Oh and THEY NOW TAKE Credit Cards!"}
{"text":"I had the Shrimp Cocktail and ceviche tostadas.  Shrimp Cocktail had a generous amount of large shrimp but lacked flavor and substance in the sauce/juice.  The ceviche tostadas were ok but nothing to write home about.  I think their big draw are the beers and other drinks.  The customer service was top notch everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"The food, and people here are equally AMAZING!!!!!!  I eat here every chance I get and though Mexican food is not my favorite, I can honestly say I could eat there every day.  I have tried so many things on the menu and can't say one bad thing about any dish.  Of course my favorite is the Combination Molcajetes bowl which has chicken, beef, and shrimp, along with everything else the eye can see.  The best way I can describe the sauce is to say that it has the flavor of a California Chili sauce, not hot, but has a little kick and if full of flavor since they cook the contents in the sauce, NOT just pour the sauce over the food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Consistent quality and service.... we have not had a bad meal yet. I would eat just about anything drenched in their red sauce...incredible depth of flavor"}
{"text":"There is no way you can beat this price for this much food, and extremely delicious food at that. The molcajete can easily feed 2 or 3 people. I don't speak much Spanish, but that doesn't matter. I still found the atmosphere friendly and welcoming. The wait staff is always accomodating. The traveling-through vendors are quite non-threatening, and immediately leave if the police come in to eat :)"}
{"text":"Molcajetes' combination molcajete rocks -- no filler -- loaded with chicken, beef, shrimp (big ones), nopales, green onion.  Hot with heat and chili - but not unbearably so.  Wear a bib.  Serves 2?  3 is more like it.    Charming decor.    Lovely service.    The real deal."}
{"text":"We were looking for something new and different and we found this place Los Molcajetes means Mortar as in mortar and pestle which their signature dish is served fresh from the oven in a big Mortar.  Unique!    We drove quite a way to get here there was a line out front, always a good sign.  We found out it was one family waiting for a big table and we were seated right away.  We were greeted with a Mariachi band singing for a table nearby and a friendly waitress came to out table very quickly.  She was super nice and seemed like she really wanted us to enjoy our food and have fun!  We each ordered a margarita and we got a small taco to split to start (that was a mistake).  When we got our dinner the Mortar is for two people and with the chips you munch on with a really spicy salsa.  Tons tons of food no appetizer needed!  The food was awesome and it had more ingredients then the normal to add to the taco you make out of your mortar.  Soso good very happy girl.  They had a clown walking around doing ballon animals a mariachi band the spanish music awards on a guy selling CDs came thru another selling candy bars and a woman selling stuffed animals!  A LOT going on!  It didn't bother me they do not bother you unless you call them over so it just kinds reminded me of laying on the beach in mexico!  LOL"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican at an amazing price! Service was outstanding and prices definitely affordable. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine has been raving about Los Molcajetes for some time now, so a couple of weekends ago a group of friends and I decided to have a late lunch here. Well,   they have live mariachi on Saturdays from 3-5. Goodness. Now as it is I am kind of a grump when it comes to live music in restaurants, and oh my god the place is sooo small and they were using microphones. It was so loud. But then again, I am a grump and sometimes act like an old fart. Everybody else was there to have a good time and not converse with their tablemates. So to each their own.  I didn't particularly like the food either. For the three of us we decided to share two molcajetes, one with beef and another with shrimp and beef. The dish is served with cactus, tomatoes and jalapeños all smothered in a sauce. For some reason, I thought the dish would be different. I had heard the dish was served with sauce, but some I thought like a chile, tomate y cebolla kind of sauce. Like literally, salsa. So the dish somewhat threw me off. It is a tomato-based sauce. It doesn't taste bad per se, but as I said I was expecting something else.  The service is great; our waitress was super nice and attentive and gets you your beers super fast. Although she could've told us about the cubeta promotion, where you get a bucket of beer for x amount, instead of paying individually for each one."}
{"text":"The chicken and beef molcajete was delicious! Coming from the bay I must say this spot is official!"}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Loved the food and the service. It was my moms birthday so it worked out perfectly that the mariachi were there. The molcajete is loaded with meats and very delicious! I will be back when I return to Vegas!"}
{"text":"We drove all the way from pahrump to eat at this restaurant i personally loved my wet burrito it was delicious nice and hot and the customer service was great really nice girls."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for hella long! Being that I never go down to this area, my boyfriend and our little group decided to come here... pssh.  We walked in, and there was like 3 servers chatting it up by the menu area... a few dirty tables... yet no one came to seat us. We stood there like morons, literally starring at the girls talking, and my bf finally got fed up and went to ask where we should sit. She told him anywhere and he advised them the tables were all dirty. She said to sit and someone would be there to clean it. We waited 10 mins, watching them jack around, and finally got up and just left.  Pretty ridiculous considering it wasn't extremely busy and they couldn't shut their effing mouths for 3 mins to come clean our table, give us menus, and take our order.   K bye."}
{"text":"Good micheladas and great service.. everything we had was delicious. Definitely found our spot for marisco's when in Vegas! A must try!"}
{"text":"Tasy Mocajetes - if you've never had, you have to give it a go! Good guac. Watch out for the street vendors who wander in and try to sell you stuff while you're eating. Service is decent. Appies ordered along entree actually come out with the entree, unless you specify otherwise. Cash only."}
{"text":"The other day my husband and I went for the second time to a place that my brother recommended called Los Molcajetes. This was our second time visiting this unassuming restaurant that is located on Eastern, a couple of miles north of the 95. The signature dishes are (not surprisingly) called 'los molcajetes', which is not so much a description of the food itself but the name of the vessel used to prepare and serve it, a Mexican mortar. Their use has been traced back to the Aztecs and Mayans who used them for crushing and grinding spices, but they are still common tools employed by Mexican cooks today. They function similarly to a cast iron skillet, becoming more seasoned with each use and imparting the cumulative flavors into the food. They also keep the food bubbling so you can eat at a leisurely pace as you continue to enjoy the food in its optimum state, nice and hot.  This is the only place I've had food prepared in this way, so unfortunately I can't make any comparisons, but I can say that it is very good and certainly worth the trip to a less desirable part of town. We have tried two different options, one with beef and one with chicken. The meat in both is of relatively high quality, but I agree with my brother's preference for the chicken ($12.99). The base of the dish is a flavorful and intensely colored red sauce that is laden with paprika (a little too much, perhaps), and is filled with your choice of meat or seafood as well as various other vegetable garnishes. These garnishes include nopales, or cactus (looks like a tongue coming out on the left hand side of the bowl pictured above), tomato, avocado, radishes, scallions, and a grilled jalapeno (watch out). There is also a wedge of lime, a cheese best described as Mexican feta, and a mini drink umbrella, which adds a whimsical touch. The chicken is roasted to tender perfection (see below), and tastes amazing on a warm flour tortilla. The broth has the right amount of heat, and is full of flavor, but Ian and I both agree that the meal could benefit from a few added elements. I liked the cheese, but it was fairly salty and dense for an already well-seasoned base. I think some crema, or Mexican sour cream, would have been the perfect antidote for the inherent flavors of the dish, and some rice, beans, and/or guacamole could have added to the texture. The meal was unique and tasted great, don't get me wrong, but got a tad boring to eat towards the end and need a little something to push it into the arena of \"oh my god I have to come back and get this tomorrow.\" I noticed that you can order the molcajetes fajita style, however, so maybe I will try that next time and see what it comes with. I'll miss the little umbrella, but I've endured much more in the name of food.  Definitely try \"Los Molcajetes\" because it is a unique place in Vegas, the food is really tasty, and the price is right. One dish easily serves two, and with the purchase of 'molcajetes' you also get a free drink. We opted for Modelo Especial, a light Mexican beer that I strongly recommend (pictured below). For both of us the meal was less than $18 with two beers (we had to get an extra, of course), so it certainly fits the bill for the Frugal Foodie blog.  Tip: Los Molcajetes is open six days a week from 10 until 9, but closed on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp. I had Chili Verde which is how I test a Mexican restaurant. My wife had a chicken and a shrimp taco. My Chili Verde was very good and ranks with best I've ever had. My wife's taco's were very flavorful and well stuffed. There are very few really good Mexican restaurants, places like you would find in Mexico. This place makes you feel like you are south of the border, authentic ambiance. But, the food is very, very good. The tortillas were home made and therefore very fresh and tasty. I could make a meal out of the tortilla's alone. The only criticism I can come up with is the salsa. It was a green salsa and a little sweet. It wasn't bad I would just prefer a high quality red  sauce. That is the only negative I can come up with. Don't hesitate to eat in this place. OMG, let me change my review above. About two months later we went back. I had the \"Molcajete's Fajita's\" which were fajitas cooked in a molcajete. I thought they were named after the restaurant. My bad. What the server didn't say was it would take 40 minutes to cook! We waited, and waited. When they came they had a lot of beef and chicken but also semi-cooked green onions on top and a big chunk of cheese. I would never try this again. The others in our group had traditional Mexican dishes which were good. But, they had a mariachi band and they were loud! We measured them at ninety seven decibels!!! I left after a long wait, not good fajitas and a headache. Still the food, overall, is pretty good, overall. Avoid the Mariachis."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in Vegas.  Great variety on the menu, and affordable.  I had the bistek ranchero.  It was sautéed with habaneros, jalapeños, onions, and tomatoes in a spicy red sauce, served with rice, beans a tortillas it was excellent.  My husband had the combo with steak taco, chicken enchilada, and quesadilla.  All very tasty.  Will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"Not authentic except for the salsa which was on the dot! Spicy but addicting. My lettuce l guess was meant only for decoration since it was dry n old. Beans and rice and tortilla don't taste home made. The campechana (seafood mix soup) was way too fish And more oysters then anything. The sope was hard like it's been frozen before. I wouldn't say I would never come again but not when I want authentic."}
{"text":"On the hunt for molcajetes in town, we spotted Los Molcajetes in the LV Weekly a few months ago.  We kept putting off our meal here due to things coming up, but finally I insisted that we eat here for Cinco de Mayo.  I arrived around 6, sat down and was immediately greeted by a server with chips, salsa, and a menu.  She started speaking to me in Spanish so I did my best to answer but then she alternated between Spanish and English with me the rest of the evening.  As a native Texan, I took Spanish from 1st through 11th grade but unfortunately am better at reading and writing it than speaking it, a travesty.  However, it was fun to practice.  I got a giant frozen strawberry margarita, which was rimmed with salt and something like Tajin (the fruit seasoning that is chile-limey), a water, and a tostada con ceviche de pulpo (Octopus tostada) while I waited for Eric R. to get there.  The ceviche tostada was huge for $5, and piled high with octopus, tomato, onion, cilantro, and a half avocado garnished the plate.  I sliced the avocado onto the tostada and enjoyed it crunching along.  I think I was there over an hour before Eric R. arrived, so I watched the mariachi band play at tables and had several visitors from hawkers (a child selling snacks, a man selling DVDs, a woman selling jewelry) but they left me alone when I did not show interest.  The server came and checked on me multiple times while I waited.  Eric R. finally showed up and got a frozen strawberry margarita too.  The server gave him a fresh basket of chips and we ordered the molcajete de combinacion (shrimp, beef and chicken).  It came with nopales (cactus), a tomato, radishes, queso fresco, a half avocado, 2 chiles, roasted scallions, and a side of tortillas (we ordered flour and got corn so we ended up with both)!  The molcajete was bubbling over when it arrived.  The tortillas were almost too hot to handle!    We really enjoyed the meal, but the beef was quite tough.  The chicken was melt-in-your-mouth tender and the shrimp was fine.  I am not sure if the fajita molcajete would have different meat, so next time I would probably order a chicken molcajete.  The restaurant is also known for seafood and offers octopus, oysters, shrimp, fish, and scallop ceviche, tostadas, cocktails, and platters.  There is a $1 charge for paying by card instead of cash."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic and great Mexican food this is the place to go! Their ambiance is great. Their signature dish is the Molcajete. Molcajetes are warm stone bowls filled with tons of delicious goodies. One of my favorites is the molcajete de combinacion. It has chicken, beef and shrimp. The flavors are out of this world. They also come with cactus, small pieces of cheese and avocado. The best part is that you can enjoy a molcajete with a delicious michelada.   Some of my other favorite dishes are the ceviche (great for sharing), and the tostadas. Their menu is pretty extensive therefore it is hard to try every single item, but so far one of my favorite places in town.  Oh and did I mention that their prices are also great? I'm glad I was able to find this gem, it is worth the drive!   Additional perks Mariachi on Sundays"}
{"text":"This is small little restaurant, I will say Mexican and Seafood is mostly what they offer. The molcajetes are great they put a lot meat in them , the seafood dishes look delicious as well, the service was excellent, they were always coming by checking how everything was going. Definitely recommend this spot to anyone."}
{"text":"I tried the asada plate... it was ok... The next day i tried \"tostadas de ceviche de pescado\" IT WAS BOMB...  They are DELICIOUS.... Also the mojarra frita !! Very nice place to eat!!!"}
{"text":"Today was a terrible experience! My family and I have been going here for over 10 years and I have never been disappointed until now. My son and I got our food well before the rest of the table. My beans were cold and partially uncooked and hard. My husbands soup was full of meat and sitting in fat that had drained from the meat in the souo that had a raw taste to it, my son refused to finished his burrito because he said the meat tasted funny! So mid meal my kids start running to the bathroom and one by one start throwing up 3 kids throwing up right after trying to eat really! My daughter orders a macho molcajete and says mom taste this and of course it taste horrible. She is also now throwing up in the bathroom. My husband and I are feeling ill  we let staff know they removed my husbands meal and my sons burrito but we paid for the rest, and left the waitress a.  $10.00 tip because the horrible food was not her fault. I will never go during a weekday to this restaurant. Again very disappointed"}
{"text":"Very good fajita's.  Their non-fajita menu is also good. Service was exceptional.  I only gave 4 stars because this place is very, very good, but not mind blowing. It is still one of my families favorites and I recommend them without hesitation. We drive 12 miles to get there."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Will definitely be back again soon, I had the shrimp molcajete and it was delicious and a decent portion for two!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! their chavela drink is to die for. Camarones  borrachos were so tasty too. You sit where you want and get greeted with complimentary chips and salsa"}
{"text":"This small family-owned restaurant, situated in a working class neighborhood, serves authentic Mexican fare.  We were served warm tortilla chips and a watery, but spicy salsa.  Based on my extensive pre trip research we started off by sharing a very good burrito with pork in a green chili sauce.    We also shared a unique creation served in and named after the 3-legged stone tool, molcajete, used in Mexico to grind chilies and spices.  This artfully presented dish included, in our case, a combination of beef, chicken, shrimp, nopales (cactus), scallions and slices of avocado in a rich red sauce and served with flour tortillas.  You grab a forkful of anything or everything, place on a warm tortilla, fold and enjoy.  It proved be very tasty, but more than we could finish."}
{"text":"This place is on THE list when I visit Vegas. The food is AWESOME, make sure you try the Namesake-Molcajetes... Shrimp, chicken, beef, dip it in the juice...the Ceviche tostadas and chicken Kabobs are Bomb-Diggity!  Wash all that goodness down with the Micheladas!  Make sure you tell the owner that Johnny & the Homie from San Diego recommended it!"}
{"text":"As a loyal customer to this traditional Mexican restaurant, I brought my family over today to share with them some amazing food and a good time. Had I known it was going to take 3 1/2 hours to eat, I would've just gone to Roberto's. Knowing how busy they usually are on Sundays, I called ahead to put my name down on the list. We got sat almost immediately upon arrival and that was probably the best part of our experience. We sat and waited 35 minutes before alma took our order for the appetizer, 40 minutes to get the appetizer and almost another hour to put our food order in. Tables came in after us and left before us repeatedly. Long story short, service sucked and they get 1 star because the food was great. After I did NOT tip, waitress walked over to the front and told all her co workers and they all turned to stare, what they didn't know was how horrible she treated us. And as a small whole in the wall, she only had 3 tables to attend. It's a shame how great I thought of this place."}
{"text":"I had high expectations from this place because of all the positive review's I've read overall I was unimpressed my chicken molcajete didn't have that kick that I was looking forward to but my margarita was delicious service was horrible she never came back to check on our table in over an hour she had maybe 4 tables she spent all of her time chatting with her co-workers I won't be back again"}
{"text":"Los Molcajetes is wonderful we had an event catered and everything was amazing!! We all love the food and the flavor of home!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE...... is awesome the waitress is very on top of her game. She works for her tips. I asked for her personal fav. which I had no idea what it would be but omg this was the best shrip quesadilla evaaaar omg so good! The shrimp is perfect I love this place... highly reccomend. VP"}
{"text":"Seeked this place out looking for a sit down, but off the path mexi place.  My wife had a whole fried fish (mojarra) and said it was outstanding.  She thought it could have been cooked a touch more, but that indicates to me that they did it just right. Kids had carne asada tacos plain, no toppings at their request.  They wolfed them down. I had two cheese enchiladas topped with their mole sauce.  It was very good.  Service was polite, sincere and prompt.  I would go back in a heatbeat.  After looking at the bill I was even more enthusiastic about this place.  Great job!  Worthy note:  Besides their delicious salsas, they had my wife's favorite bottled hot sauce on tap (Castillos).  That is a first!  Stacky Best Of Award  Mojarra"}
{"text":"I read the reviews and wanted to try it. Super good and the pictures don't lie. A hole in the wall but if you feel like adventure and not afraid of the hood try this hidden gem.  The signature dish came out bubbling and full of flavor. My husband ask for a more traditional dish with diablo sauce. It made his eyes tear up and way to spicy for my taste.  But he sucked it up and ate it like a man.  They only serve beer and frozen margaritas and played really loud music.  The 4 stars are for the food only. Glad We tried it."}
{"text":"Very well pleased with how the food was prepared, fresh hand made tortillas & extremely tasteful food. Not to mention the attitude I was greeted with and treated with throughout my visit. Best & maybe the only place to find molcajetes in town . Would recommend to anyone who wants good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Bring cash. Cash only business. They lose one star for not taking cards, and for not being able to hear their awesome juke box they had fully loaded with great music. Now the FOOD. they give you the chips and salsa at the beginning while waiting for your food and that was good. ..esp since good food comes to those who wait. I orderd menudo and it was soooo good probablyt he 2nd best in the city that i've tried yet. It went to #2 b/c of the lack of hominy. hmmm. i love the hominy. I guess its good when y ou're watching your carb content. 2nd my bf ordered the beef molcajaete and he said that it was probably the best thing hes ever eaten in his life. It was perfect he said. It had beef (steak type) with this awesome chile sauce and carrots and radishes and jalapenos and veg coupled with cotija cheese and avocado all in this huge molcajete -- hence the name. It was precious that he didnt know it came in that - fresh out of the oven burning hot.. literally. HOT!!!!!! (temperature) and spicy too. It was out of this world he said. He cannot wait till it gets to be winter again so he can go back. I think he'd eat there every week if he could. def. try this place. Its so worth it"}
{"text":"I grew up eating at this restaurant and throughout the years it's maintained its authentucity and quality. The service is always very friendly and the food is a true representation of Authentic Mexican dishes."}
{"text":"The first time I ever had a Molcajete (translation is Mortar and Pestle) was in Puerto Vallarta and it was one of the most delicious meals that I have ever had.  It has been about 6 years since I have had one and yesterday was my lucky day....I found a review on Yelp about a restaurant that served Molcajetes.  As soon as I read the other reviews, I literally could feel my mouth start to salivate.  I had no idea that this existed in Las Vegas....but I knew that I had dinner plans that night.   Three of us met for dinner (2 of us ordered the Molcajetes and the other ordered the fried fish).  The order came out and looked exactly as I remembered in Puerto Vallarta.  It comes in a steaming hot mortar (like a volcanic rock) and is enough for two.  I ordered the chicken and asked if they would also add shrimp (they were very accommodating), the BF ordered the combination (chicken, beef and shrimp) and our friend ordered the Fried Fish (which was a Whole Fish which he thought was delicious).   The Molcajetes were very authentic and very good.  The sauce had a deep, rich flavor that I am sure I will craving for weeks to come (thank God that I have leftovers today).  They also add Roasted Peppers, Limes, Avocados, Radishes, a couple Cactus Leaves, Grilled Green Onions, a small square of fresh cheese and FRESH tortillas for dipping (which is a must).  AND...to top it off....The price is extremely reasonable for the portion size!!  ENJOY"}
{"text":"Amazing place!! We're so glad we found it. Everything was perfect, from the customer service to the atmosphere and the food of course! You will not regret coming here."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food and great customer service. We tried Mocaljetes combination - beef, chicken and shrimps; and Menudo. For dessert, we tried cheese cake burrito,  which was also delicious! Will definitely recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"I ate here today with some trepidation because of previous reviews. I knew the food would be great - and it was. My friend had the shrimp rellenos which was superior. Another friend had the chicken salad - superb. My cheese enchiladas reminded me of home - San Antonio! Contrary to other reviewers I have to commend the management on the cleanliness of the restaurant. Our waitress spoke fluent English and the service was good. Don't miss an opportunity to dine here - you won't regret it"}
{"text":"I found this place two years ago when in Vegas for my daughter's 21st birthday. Used Yelp to help find a place for dinner and our group wasn't disappointed. Portions of molcajetes are large and not to mention fresh handmade corn tortillas to go with it. When in Vegas this is a must stop place!!!"}
{"text":"This place is good to go without your boyfriend/husband? The food is good, not worth the price tho, but the waitresses are too into your man, if you know what I mean? I guess if you have an ugly boyfriend...go for it!! Seriously"}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite places for a while, but I have to post that I was very disappointed with the service yesterday. As I do understand that they were busy and we were waiting for tables to be cleaned about 4 were just dirty. Up until we decided to walk about after waiting 30 minutes she runs out and says your table is ready. We did not return. They were quick to pick up the tips left on the table but not the mess.   Spanish translation below  Este hacido uno de mis lugares favoritos por mucho tiempo, en esta ocasión estoy bastante desilusionada con el servicio de ayer. Y entiendo que estaban bastante ocupados pero esperábamos por gusto por qué avían 4 mesas disponibles solo era de que las limpiaran. No fuimos después de esperar media hora fue cuando salio una de las muchachas y nos dijo que ya estaba la mesa. Claro que no regresamos. Pero fue muy lista la muchacha para recoger sus propinas pero no la mesa."}
{"text":"Food was really good, I enjoyed it very much. The service was a little slow and the parking is horrible.  As far as everything as a whole, it was lacking that wow feeling but I will be back for a 2nd run at it."}
{"text":"We stumbled on Los Molcajetes looking for some authentic mexican food.  WOW! AWESOME!  Went there last night and the food was superb.  At first a little intimidating because we were the only non spanish speaking folks there.  The combination platters are plentiful, tasty and cheap.  The Carne Asada is superb.  And I ordered 10 tacos!!  Awesome.  In fact the place is so good, we went back there for lunch today and intend going back for dinner tomorrow night before we head back to Washington DC.  If you are looking for a fancy joint, or tex mex, don't go.  If you are looking for fresh, home cooked, authentic mexican food at unbelievable cheap prices........this place is your winning lottery ticket.  I will come back to this place everytime I am in Las Vegas.  Forget Morton's and all the fancy joints, this place beats them all for quality."}
{"text":"After reading a few reviews from this place my husband and me decided to try this place and we really enjoyed it.  The food was great and cheap. We had a Shrimp Molcajete and it was delicious. We are making planes to go next week."}
{"text":"Holy Crap, I love this place!!  I had the Shrimp and Octopus Molcajetes.  Not at all what I was expecting but probably one of the best Shrimp and Octopus dishes ever.  The dish comes in a boiling hot lava rock caldron that can barely contain all of the flavor literally bursting out of it.  One of these can easily be split between 2 people so you can try any one of a myriad of other delicacies this place has to offer.  One of which is the Fish Ceviche Tostada.  Which by the way they literally PILE the ceviche on top of a tostada.  If I was at home I would be able to make two tostadas for as much fish as they pile on one....  but who am I to complain!  If you are in the area by all means stop in this place and prepare for a feast!!"}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas for the weekend, craving authentic Mexican food and came across this place! The food was AMAZING!!! Great food off the strip, great fast service and Micheladas are really GOOD! Great experience! We will definitely stop by next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed this restaurant. The service was great. Our waitress was really sweet and she checked on us often. The food was very good and we really got a lot for the low price. The salsa that came with the chips was fantastic. Beer prices are great! Only $3 for domestic and $3.50 for imports. They have all the great Mexican beers available! The ambiance is nice and family friendly. We are looking forward to coming back for their awesome happy hour soon!"}
{"text":"I must say the Molcajetes were extremely something to behold. In this very hot slate bowl comes a delicious mixture of sliced meats, cactus leaves, and garnishes such as avocado and guacamole. I would strongly suggest ordering one on your behalf, but if you do it is advisable to split it between two people."}
{"text":"Amazing food every single time. Great ambiance very traditional. Perfect variety of food. Breakfast food and kids menu."}
{"text":"This is my kind of place.  They do what they do - they do it well - they hope you enjoy...  that's it and it's that simple.  It is authentic and unpretentious.    They do molcajetes here.  I guess the molcajetes is the cooking/serving vessel made from volcanic rock.  You have your choice of steak, chicken, shrimp and I think they had octopus.  It comes with cotija cheese, cactus leaves, onion, jalapeno, tomatoes and maybe a few other things.  The best part is the sauce.  It really ties the dish together.  I had the combo; steak, chicken and shrimp.  The steak was a little tough and not to flavorful.  I could have done with out that.  It didn't matter thought the sauce made up for it.  It was a big dish - big enough for 2.  The sauce really was that good.  It is like an enchilada sauce but with more flavors.  I think I tasted a hint of chipotle.  It was a-m-a-z-i-n-g.  It really was just a bunch of stuff in a heavy hot bowl... but the sauce... makes it MOLCAJATES!  That sauce was so good you could have dropped some cat turds in there and it would have been good!!!!!!!!  I really liked it.  It was different. It was NOT some half ass Mexican dish served with some rice and beans.    When we ere leaving - they actually said thanks for coming in.  (that is a hint to some other restaurant owners)  It is worth the trip to the east side!"}
{"text":"Went here for Mothers Day and I really enjoyed myself. The food was great and the service was good, they even had mariachis, I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Los Molcajetes extremadamente recomendados, super rico y muy buenos precios no todo lo bueno esta en el strip en Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service, what more can we say. We have eating here once with a large group over a year ago and last week we were looking for a mexican breakfast and noticed this place opened at 9am daily so we stopped in. This led to a second stop for breakfast on friday. I ordered my favorite which is chilaquiles verdes and the guys both ordered the huaraches con carne. I asked for the chilaquiles on the crunchy side with over easy eggs. The eggs came out over hard and the waitress quickly brought out two perfect over easy. Both the guys loved there huaraches. The waitress was very nice and friendly.  We look forward to our next visit for dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent food . Great beer ! Great music, live music or on the radio. Mimi one the servers there is wonderful she gets everything you need when you needed always in a great mood . As well along with the rest of the servers . I highly recommend this place to anyone that is looking for real traditional Mexican food ."}
{"text":"The food here is super good. The Macho Molcajete was delish! The salsa in the dish is tasty and hot! On the weekends they have live music- grupo of four guys. Cold beers good food and  tunes - Great Vegas  trip! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is  very tasty not to mention there portions are very fulfilling !!!!! Plus prices are reasonable!! I was there this past weekend on Sunday however atmosphere is pretty calm!!"}
{"text":"I have never had a molcajete before but this is seriously amazing. I usually get the octopus one and its delicious. My only complaint is that they bring it out on top of a kitchen towel on top of another plate. You should not have to see kitchen towels on your table anywhere."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth the trip! Molcajetes are their specialty, and it shows. \"Molcajete\" is Mexican Spanish for mortar, as in mortar & pestle. These are quite a bit larger than your usual kitchen mortar and made of volcanic rock. If you order one, your food is cooked and served in the mortar, and the sauce is still bubbling like lava when it comes to your table.  The two of us couldn't decide exactly what we wanted in our shared molcajete (and damn, were we glad we shared one, they're enormous!), so we got the combination one that has beef, chicken, and shrimp, along with the usual lime wedge, cactus strips, radish slices, avocado slice, large slice of tomato, and amazing red sauce, served with either flour or corn tortillas (we chose corn; they were soft, white corn tortillas, and very tasty). That alone could have fed three people, so needless to say we didn't try anything else while we were there, save for the chips & salsa they give you in the beginning. That salsa was also super tasty!  We were completely entertained the whole time watching Univision on the few mounted flat-screen TVs. Well, one of them was playing all music videos, and the other two were tuned to Univision. During most of our stay, a telenovela was on. This might not be as amusing to those who don't speak or read Spanish, but then again, I think they're pretty entertaining regardless.  Previous reviews have noted that Los Molcajetes has separate English & Spanish menus and that they don't accept cards. Perhaps they've recently changed these things, because the menus we were given were bilingual, and there's a sign in Spanish in the back of the room that says they accept both credit and debit cards but charge $1 for the service.  I also saw at least one previous reviewer who noted feeling like \"idiot gringos\" or something to that effect because they stood around waiting for someone to assist them when they walked in. When we entered, there was a sign just inside the door that said \"Sientense donde gusten,\" which translates as \"Seat yourselves wherever you'd like,\" and that's what we did. So, gringos, if you see this sign, pretend it says \"Please seat yourselves\" and act accordingly. ;) Be aware that if you do so, however, the very friendly waitress may think you speak Spanish and start out speaking to you in Spanish when she comes to your table, like she did with us. Both of us do understand and speak decent Spanish, but the waitress quickly realized that our main language was English, so she accommodated. Don't be scurrred, is what I'm sayin'.  Yes, as mentioned by others, there are vendors (of CDs, beaded jewelry, etc.) and musicians who wander in & out of the place and will come by your table to see if you're interested in what they're selling. A simple \"no thank you\" and a smile is enough to get them to quietly move on; no one tried to hard-sell us or was particularly bothersome. I've noticed several (probably American) reviewers remark about this aspect of the restaurant negatively, and some have even knocked a star or two off for it. This phenomenon of wandering vendors is actually quite commonplace in restaurants throughout Latin America in all but the fanciest of places, and anyone who's travelled around a bit likely knows this and won't be aggravated by it."}
{"text":"My family and I heard so any great reviews about this place thy we just had to try it out yesterday! It was everything we heard and more. I know authentic Mexican food and let me tell you they live up to that and more. Amazing customer service and atmosphere. We will definitely attend regularly and recommend to everyone. Don't knock it till you try it!! ;) Also do the amount of food you get the prices are great! Don't forget to try a cocktail, my personal favorite Modelo Especial Michelada!!!"}
