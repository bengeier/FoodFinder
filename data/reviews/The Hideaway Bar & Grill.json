{"text":"Great bar and great staff. Its a divebar filled with hardworking americans so hipsters beware."}
{"text":"I really don't know this place very well under it's newer name, The Hideaway. In my underage years, it was called Whiskey River and then The Anchor. 

I remember it most as The Anchor. There was a huge airbrushed lifesize Popeye near the front door. Very dark and dank, the ultimate dive bar. 

This place is within walking distance of my parents house and my friends and I were here all of the time - especially after we realized they would never card us. (I'm not sure if they still engage in this practice - obviously they've changed hands in the past 12 years). 

I have many fond memories of this bar. I once woke up on the dirty bathroom floor after one too many shots of tequila - thanks to the DeMarco's donuts guy. 

Too bad the old owner started blowing lines of OxyContin."}
{"text":"For the 2nd time my friend got ticks from this bar. If you hate yourself you should still consider another dive bar. Also don't go to the bathroom because there's feces all over the walls. Zero stars, zero women."}
{"text":"This place is going down hill since the last time i was there. It's filthy and disgusting i used to be a frequent customer, but not anymore the place has picked up some creeps and weirdos"}
