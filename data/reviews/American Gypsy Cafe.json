{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this past weekend. The dishes are flavorful and fresh. Staff is friendly and plenty of parking available. We ordered the Beef Koobideh Kabob and the Shish Kabob...it was very juicy and cooked well. This is a great place if you're in the mood for Persian/Mediterranean cuisine, highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing serving! I highly recommend this place for gourmet kabob dishes at an exceptional price"}
{"text":"I am very excited that I found this restaurant. They offer a very good lunch special menu with good prices for generous portions of delicious food. I plan on returning often. The beef koobideh kabob was succulent and the side salad was refreshingly bright."}
{"text":"Tried this place again with my favorite peeps and again, it was outstanding!!  They did a nice family style platter for us with a variety of different dishes, and everyone enjoyed it tremendously."}
{"text":"Took an hour to be served water. By the second hour, they had no idea they took our order which the server reiterated three times. Very understaffed and unorganized. No idea how the food is, because we were never served any in the two hours we sat there."}
{"text":"Highly Recommended - Good food, reasonable prices, and friendly staff. Even our picky eater daughter loved the Kebabs. We had a great time.  If you can, go there on Saturday when the live music and the belly dancer are there."}
{"text":"I love every thing about this place. Food , taste, servers, price. Not the location tho! It is far from my house(25 mins drive) but if you like to try mediterranean food specially Persian this is the place to go. Barg kabab , kobide kabab, tahdigh with ghorme sabzi are the best on the menu that i have tried. The food quality bitting all other Persian food in the town. Tables always design with napkins and almost full set if silverware  that is not every where in usual restaurants.( i have been on top ones so i know what is full set )  Yogurt drink or dough is homemade style which is perfect and delicious and brings you the true food culture of mediterraneans. Servers checking on you every often which is perfect to keep the table clean for next dish that is coming. Pricing is fair for the quality, also if you are a fan of live music, they have live music on weekends i think. I have not been there on weekends!  I was sold to this restaurant for their kababs. Try them."}
{"text":"This place was outstanding and reminded me of the Middle East and their hospitality. I have been looking for a good Middle Eastern restaurant in Vegas. I have found it and will recommend it to all my foodie friends. I can't wait to go back. The service couldn't have been any better."}
{"text":"Excellent food, reasonably priced and friendly service. The restaurant is clean and well kept. We had Persian tea and was also very tasty, highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"They were out of everything...no wraps, sandwiched or combos. So judt kabobs, salad amd rice. Didnt have gyro. Very quite, nothing memorable."}
{"text":"Possibly the best persian food I've ever had. I'm Persian and lived in Los Angeles for over 20 years. The chicken koobideh kabob melts in your mouth. The beef koobideh was amazing too! My husband raved about the barg!!! We also tried Hafez. This place is 1000 times better. Go here and no where else."}
{"text":"Hostess was very nice and location appeared clean but definitely not authentic Mediterranean food.. Selection very limited. Not like any other Mediterranean restaurants I've visited. NO Tabouli or fresh-pressed/whipped Gael...the hummus didn't seem fresh, rice was over cooked and they gave me chips with my wrap that had pickles and thousand island dressing."}
{"text":"Excellent food! We were so sad we didn't get the chance to sit in the actual restaurant and enjoy but we were on our way out of town so we placed a to go order over the phone and the woman that helped us was extremely friendly and kind. Once we received our food we were shocked with the portions and serving sizes. Thank you so much for the excellent service and we will most definitely be coming back when we're in town.   Excellent, great tasting food. Very reasonable portion sizes and wonderful customer service!"}
{"text":"Don't be freaked out by the fact this building has been a million different businesses. American Gypsy is legit! I ordered the number 1 lunch special and am currently in a delicious food coma.  The gal who took my order was friendly and helpful. I received my order very quickly. Thank goodness my office is super close otherwise I would have dove into my stryo container while driving. It smelled so good!  My takeout was packed with extraordinary care and attention to detail. I was not expecting that at all. My hummus was double packed to prevent leakage. I received a packet of sumac! A truly underrated spice...  Food was delicious and plentiful. I couldn't finish everything, which is rare for me. This meal really hit the spot.  I look forward to trying more items soon. I'm glad I branched out today!"}
{"text":"If there is one thing I crave about Persian food, it is the creamy and aromatic spice flavor of Cashke Bademjan, which is a delicious and Authentic Persian Eggplant Dip, and it's a personal favorite appetizer. I am hoping to get the same food experience at this restaurant. I did find it unusual that this specific item is not listed anywhere on the dining menu, but it is on the to-go menu worded differently. So I place an order of the Kashko Bademjan ($7.95) and the Falafel Plate ($9.95).   The Kashko Bademjan has eggplants saut√©ed with garlic and herbs, and it is topped with kashk yogurt, a drizzle of fried mint, caramelized onions, and serve with soft pita bread. I am a bit disappointed with this dish. The quality flavor is there but with the excess amount of oil, it makes it very difficult to enjoy eating with pita bread.   Now the Falafel Plate comes with four deep fried patties that are a mixture of chickpeas and fava beans and is serve with a cucumber yogurt dip, along with a crisp lettuce salad that has slice tomatoes, cucumbers, pickled red cabbage, and basmati rice. The salad is good and the basmati rice is cook to perfection, but the deep-fried falafel patty taste dry and crumbly like crackers. Even if I add the cucumber yogurt, the dryness texture is still unappealing. Maybe if they had made this into a falafel ball and deep-fried it, the outside will be crunchy but inside the falafel ball, it may still remain soft.   The service is good and the dining area is clean. You can easily find this restaurant by looking for the Snug Harbor sign and you will see the light post. There is one thing that is puzzling though, the music in the background. It makes me wonder why are they playing Spanish songs at a Persian restaurant. That is so not authentic."}
{"text":"Today is my third trip to American gypsy cafe. I've had twice for take out and once I've eaten there   This is the best Persian food I've had in vegas. The food is consistently good.  If you're from Los Angeles you're familiar with Raffis.  That's my benchmark for kabob.  Well this is as close as you're gonna get in vegas.   The khoreshts both the gheymeh and ghormeh Sabzi are just ok. The tadig was thick but tasted a little old.   The joojeh kabob on the bone is moist and juicy and full of flavor.   The beef soltani is always delicious and a must have.   The ground chicken from the chicken soltani is not over powering and is juicy. The chicken breast barg is seasoned differently. I'm undecided if I'd order it again.   The rice is perfect. I've had both the plain and zereshk.    Portions are huge.   Service is better than most Persian places. The owner is always there.   The restaurant is usually slow. If you go and no one is there go in anyway. You won't be disappointed !!  Enjoy.   Update 11/30/2017 I've gotten take out a few times this week and I've noticed the quality of the food has gone down.   I tried the thadig with ghormeh sabzi.  Delicious but not enough of the ghormeh sabzi to accompany the thadig. We ended up throwing most of the thadig away because it was just chewy and greasy.  I know it's a sin to throw away thadig but that's how bad it was.   My biggest disappointment comes from beef kubideh.  It used to be a higher quality beef.  It's now rubbery.   The zereshk polo used to be full of the little berries. Now there is less than half of what they used to give you.   It's all yellow food coloring with half a  handful of the berries."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas and asked my Lyft driver for good Persian food and he recommended this place. I know there is few Persian resturant in Vegas, so we came here and I got to tell you this place by far has great food compare to the ones that I have been in Vegas. I highly recommend this place and definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Best Persian Restaurant in Las Vegas. With live entertainment and belly dancer on Saturday nights. I had the Soltani Kabob wich comes with two kabob skewers.  A Filet minion Kabob that melts in your mouth, and a Kubideh Kabob with extra ordinary flavor. The food was just delocious. The Two Kabobs were served with fragrant Basmati Rice and grilled tomatoes. Tell the owner Tony  Shawn sent you. He is always there welcoming you with a smile. Taking pride in making sure you have a perfect culinary experience at his restaurant ."}
{"text":"Prices here are amazing, I have been to other places and everything here is very reasonable. Their Dough (yogurt drink) has bubbles or soda water in it which is not my favorite. Other than that I enjoyed my meal as well as the service. The table next to me were not familiar with Persian food and the server did a great job explaining it to them, each dish.   For dessert I was hoping for traditional Persian dessert but instead they just had tiramisu (oddly enough my dads favorite).   What food they have here is very authentic (I am Iranian/Persian) and similar the home cooking.   I heard they have belly dancers about one a month so I cant wait to come here to see and experience that."}
{"text":"Delicious - the kabobs were out of this world and the prices very reasonable. Wish they participated in Uber Eats but otherwise no complaints."}
{"text":"This is great restaurant. I recommend it, at least try one time. I ordered ground beef which so good."}
{"text":"The food is great, despite the bland outside and unimaginative decor, the chef here knows good Iranian kabob and delivers food that could hold its own even if it were located in Westwood in Los Angeles's Persian Square."}
{"text":"The #1 spot for Persian food in Vegas! Came here at 5 pm for a very late lunch.  The place was completely empty!  I was greeted with a warm welcome by the owner and his wife.  The tables were nicely decorated with folded napkins and fairly clean.  Nice ambiance with mid eastern music playing in the background.  I ordered the chicken and beef koobideh kabobs!  My meal came with basmati rice and a salad and Pita bread on the side!  They have a spice called Sumac which you put on the kabob.  It adds a nice kick to the dish.  The whole cutural experience was amazing.  I spoke with the owner for about 30 minutes about where he was from and the origins of the food he makes.  I feel like ive been to Persia just from one meal here!  The owners are wonderful people and Im very excites to try more of their foods!  Especially the lamb and stews!"}
{"text":"Excellent kabob !!! Not sure how they make it so juicy but I think it's the best kabob I've ever had. Definitely will be back to try everything else on the menu when I get a chance. I was a bit skeptical when I saw all the excellent ratings at first but trying it myself I see why."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch yesterday as I was coming back from an errand in North Las Vegas. I have been craving the vegan ghorme Sabzi and could not curb the cravings any longer!  First impression walking in the door is that this is very much like the Persian restaurants in SoCal I have grown up going to with my family. The decor was nice, authentic, & the atmosphere was very mellow and inviting, yet classy. Tony, the owner was very kind, and although I saw they were set up to have a large party, he was still accommodating to my request for a vegan meal. There weren't very many vegan options yet but he did explain that they would be adding more within the next week or two. Definitely piqued my interest for return visits.  We ordered a Shirazi salad (which is my last name..as this particular salad originated in the city where my ancestors are from). It came out aesthetically pleasing and tasting exactly the way it should. Fresh, cut up just right, and with the perfect amount of lemony seasoning. Tha basmati rice with saffron was perfectly fluffy, with no butter just as I had requested. The Ghorme Sabzi was flavorful and cooked for the amount of time to truly get the flavor right. Also, this food was not overly salted so I was able to add in the amount of salt I wanted.  I really enjoyed my meal and will definitely return. Tony is a class act that you can tell genuinely cares about his business. As a patron- that really matters to me where I spend my money.  I'm looking forward to seeing what items he will be adding in the next few weeks, and I am already craving my return!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed by this place.   I was looking for Mediterranean in the Eastern and Flamingo area and stumbled across this place on Yelp.   I had never seen it before on yelp so I do not know how long it has been open. When I traveled on Flamingo I actually passed it because everything in this particular shopping center appeared to be closed (in the middle of the afternoon). Once I actually pulled into the parking lot it's still appeared that everything was closed.   Once I walked in, I realize that this place is very nice. Very clean, and very nicely decorated. The bathroom was also extremely clean which I truly appreciate.   I went with the lunch special of the chicken skewers. It was $8.95 and I couldn't believe the amount of food that they had for that price. One of my coworkers tried the bread that came out and said that it was warm which was awesome but quite chewy which was not awesome.   The server was friendly and his service was great. The food was very good.   One negative was that I wanted a second chicken skewer to double the protein on my plate and they charged $6.95 for it. The entire plate was only $8.95. I think that an additional skewer at lunch should have a lunch price so that an $8.95 lunch special doesn't turn into $16 plus tax and gratuity.   That being said, I know most people don't get extra chicken so it typically would not have been an issue.   I will definitely be going back on future lunch breaks."}
{"text":"We ordered beef kabob and chicken boneless kabob. Omg so delicious and really good price, clean and nice people."}
{"text":"Never in my life have I had such bad service. My family and I waited one hour to get water and our order taken (no exaggeration, we literally kept track of the time). After placing our order with the waitress, we waited 1 hour and our food hadn't came yet. Once we asked when our food was coming, the waiter asked us \"you haven't ate yet?!\" They then told us it would be another 20-30 min. So at this point we were at the restaurant for 2 hours without food and they were asking us to wait another 30 minutes, no apologies, no food. We had to get up and leave and then didn't apologize. I've never wrote a bad review on yelp but this was the worst service I have ever received."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great Iranian (Persian) or Mediterranean food this is the place to go! They have the best food and the greatest customer service. If you are in Vegas stop by this place, don't miss out on it!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, beef kabobs were amazing, and super close to my work. Atmosphere is clean and nicely decorated. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting great middle eastern cuisine."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner on our way to see Hamilton at the Smith Center and we were blown away.   My friend and I each ordered a filet Shish Kabob dinner and we had the option to split 1/2 salad 1/2 rice or all of either one.  I chose the 1/2 salad and 1/2 rice and was pleasantly surprised by the amounts of each.   We also ordered a hummus and a tzaziki which came with a basket of pita.  Suffice it to say, everything was plentiful, fresh and delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. My dad doesnt eat any kabobs but only this one. Never have been disappointed, everytime we went the food was fresh and so so good!"}
{"text":"After moving to Vegas from California, I never though I would find a place that has koobideh! I would always this that I'd have to wait til I visit back home til I was able eat this again, but luckily I found this gem! Literally right next to my house! To be entirely honest, I think this place has THE BEST beef koobideh I've ever had. It's so juicy and flavorful with a ton of rice! I usually don't eat much rice, but whenever I eat food from here I almost finish everything! 2 piece beef koobideh with an extra roasted tomato is what I've ordered that past 4 times. SO GOOD. Their barg( I think) is so good too! Dining in or doing it Togo is entirely the same quality! 100000 stars!!"}
{"text":"Wow.... This place has been open for about 4 months.... The place is huge, clean, white table clothed, and formal-looking. The service is okay as there was only one waiter. Place is not crowded maybe because it's new and people don't know where it is. The food however, is a different story. The lamb chops were cooked properly as I ordered them MR. They were very tasty and tender. Im not a big chicken fan but the Cornish chicken was delicious, so were the beef kabobs. The rice pilaf was great and perfectly cooked.  The prices were reasonable. Only drawback for me... No lamb kabobs, which I believe they'll prepare well. I hope this place remains open as I've seen a lot of food businesses with great cuisine close. I will definitely be back !!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic Persian food! Reminds me of my moms cooking :) the tahdig with ghormeh sabzee and gheymeh is delicious!!! The soltani kabob was so so tasty and their homemade doogh is yummy!! I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST chicken koobideh I've ever had.  The flavor is great, cooked perfectly, moist and melts in your mouth!  I had it from their Daily Lunch Special menu off a flier I got at my office.  The lunch special runs late in the day (11am to 4pm) which is perfect for me since I don't usually take lunch until around 2 or 3pm.  I went there with my friend who ordered the the Beef Koobideh and was very pleased with it.  We took our coworkers there a few days later and they agreed that their meals were excellent.  The portions are generous and price is reasonable.  The inside of the restaurant is spacious and clean; looks new.  The exterior leaves much to be desired.  It's easy to miss if you aren't specifically going there.  Look for the lighthouse, that's what I tell my friends.   My only complaint, if any, are that some of the forks look like the tips were burned.  Over-sterilization perhaps? Anyway, if you're sick of the usual burger, sandwich or fast food at lunch, give American Gypsy a try.  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"So my husband finally found chicken koobideh in Las Vegas!  My chicken kabob was juicy and flavorful. My only complaints are the poor quality pita and the fact that they wouldn't do a 1-for-1 substitute of shirazi salad instead of house salad on the combo--they charged extra.  We'll be back--I'll just order differently."}
{"text":"This place has fresh Persian food. I love the chicken with bones. I use this place to cater lunch meetings. They have great catering packages if you call in. Would definitely recommend it if you're trying to do something different. And get the tadhig!"}
{"text":"Eaten there twice so far and both time everything has been excellent.  Very tasty food and the owner actually goes in the back and cooks it all up himself.  Falafel appetizer and hummus are great starters and the beef koobideh kabobs are great.  My friend had the chicken koobideh kabob and loved it.  Lunch specials have great deals too."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. The owner was very sweet and the food was amazing. I had the beef koobideh kabob. The flavor was wonderful. I am a bit of a hummus snob, and the hummus also passed the test. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We use to go here till they closed .... was glad too see it reopen was told the reason behind the closure so it was a positive knowing that it was re-opened under a new name.  Went here with my uncle cause he had lived in Iran for years so he was craving this cuisine just as much as myself.  We ordered the falafal which was amazing he ordered the beef kabob and I ordered the rack of lamb, both amazing dishes and they are not stingy when it comes to rice. What a great flavor and friendly service.   My only wish was that they had more selection on dessert but that's just small oversight. I'm glad they are back up and operating and will be returning soon."}
{"text":"My first experience at this restaurant was just excellent. Food was very delicious service 5***** if I could give more I would. I live in LA and our expectations from Persian restaurant is way to high due to have many options and this place was by far no less than any of them. I for sure come back on our next visit to Los Vegas. Highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Good quality Mediterranean food- and affordable. Not a huge menu, but what they do is good. Not a great location, but fine for locals. Hopefully more people will give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is consistently serving delicious kabobs cooked & seasoned perfectly! Decor is a touch dated but the food is great w/ big servings if you're hungry. I always clean my plate. Good service."}
{"text":"Great food and we had a great time here interfering a party that seemed to be going on here. The family platter we got was sooo good, would definitely return! I also really liked the sour milk yogurt drink they have here."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem.  Good healthy Mediterranean food and great service. This is my neighborhood go to.  For lunch I love the barley soup and the Greek Salad.  They have a wonderful variety of great food and the service is outstanding.  Tina the hostess and food server is friendly and since I have food restrictions, can help me with menu items. The food is moderately priced and great value."}
{"text":"Really tasty kabobs in the family meal. It's a lot of food for a reasonable price. Although make sure to ask for pita and cucumber sauce, since those aren't necessarily included (unless they just forgot in my case)."}
{"text":"Great, fast service in a nice atmosphere. The food was fresh and delicious. Great lunch deal I almost feel like I underpaid for my meal."}
{"text":"We were craving Persian food and went to American Gypsy Cafe with another couple for dinner this week based on the strength of the yelp reviews. Although the food we ordered was good, the restaurant was out of a significant number of things we would have ordered that are standard fare in such a restaurant,and the service was neglectful, even though the restaurant was not busy.  We arrived at 7 PM on Thursday evening, the place was clean and presentable and there were three tables occupied. The four of us were seated at a nice booth. We ordered beers and doogh (yogurt drink) and the Greek salad as an appetizer. We were told that they did not have the tadigh (crunchy bottom of the pot rice appetizer), which we had been craving. We were surprised by this considering that the tadigh is a byproduct of the cooking of a pot of rice, and the restaurant serves rice.  For the main course, we ordered some soltani beef kebabs with rice, some koobideh beef kebabs with rice, and one of each of the stews.  After several minutes, the waitress came to our table to inform us that the stews were not available except in vegetarian form. Again, we were surprised and disappointed, but we ordered one of the vegan stews anyway, because we wanted our friends to try a variety of Persian food.  The dinner arrived quickly while we were still on our salad course and we had to make acrobatic moves of our plates to allow things to fit on the booth table. The salad was well seasoned, the kebabs were tasty and so was the rice. The vegan stew (gheymeh) was just OK and, as earlier mentioned, we would've preferred for it to have the chunks of meat normally found in this dish.  After our meal, we asked for the dessert menu and were told that they were \"out of dessert tonight.\" We ended up ordering a few teas, which were brought out with a few Keebler like box cookies. We were disappointed that we were not able to introduce our guests to Persian ice cream and the other Persian desserts that are normally served at such a restaurant and were indeed on the menu.  In sum, we were somewhat underwhelmed by our dining experience and were left wondering if the place should not have limited itself to being a kebab house and lowering its prices accordingly. Given the exceptional variety and quality of restaurants on and off the Las Vegas strip, we would be hard-pressed to go back to a restaurant that is seemingly out of everything but the kebabs we ordered."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The kabobs are juicy and absolutely delicious. The manager, leila was incredibly nice and everyone kept checking in on us to make sure everything is going well. Leila even recommended a good place to go out after, since we were only vacationing in Vegas. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We had the chicken and beef kabobs! Wow!  Everything was fresh and delicious.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I've lived just around the corner from here for a year and just tried this place for the first time. It's going to be on our short list for sure. We ordered the chicken koobideh and the gheymeh stew and a couple of soups and salad. Portions were generous and everything was tasty. Will for sure be back and would love to check out the party platter option for my next event.  Will be back and would recommend"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Order the beef soltani it's amazing! They also present the food so pretty! We usually stop by here a few times a month.  It's our secret spot, but now you know!"}
{"text":"Great service! Owner and workers were very friendly. I asked for a hot tea and they gave it for free  We got hummus, chicken soltani kabob and lentil soup. They were all good and big portion."}
{"text":"The food here is so good! We've been twice and each thing we ordered was just delicious. We've had the Soltani Beef and Soltani Chicken plates, the Rack of Lamb, Shirazi Salad, and the Lentil Soup. Looking forward to tasting other things on the menu, too. Also, if you ask they seem to usually have the barberries and are happy to make the polo rice for a small up-charge. The only negative is the band on Saturday night that starts playing at 8pm is really loud so that you can't have a conversation so I would recommend coming on a different night or coming early if it is Saturday."}
{"text":"I've been to this establishment several times and the food has typically been decent at best.   I wish there were more Persian restaurants in town but they are very limited.  I live in Henderson and American Gypsy, though still a drive is the closest.  Tonight we had friends in town and my fianc√© being Persian wanted to introduce them to chicken kabob, koobidah and tadig.  We ordered the food to go.  When she got the food home we were completely disappointed.  The beef was burned, greasy and tasteless.   The gaymeh was very oily and was unappetizing.  We paid over $100 for that meal.  What makes me angry is my fianc√© called to get a little satisfaction and the manager did not even apologize.  After stewing about it I called the restaurant and spoke to the same manager.  She was unapologetic and told me if I bring the food to her she can see what I'm telling her.  Implying that I was lying.  Like I mentioned before, I had friends in town and did not want to drive uneaten food back there.  Her customer service was horrendous and she should not even be allowed to speak on the phone.  All I wanted was some sort of satisfaction.  At the very least an apology but she acted like I was trying to rip her off.  Very disappointed and I will never go there again.  I'll make the drive to Zaytoon and get some really good food."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Persian cuisine resturant in Vegas. The place is nicely decorated and very clean. I am very impressed   with their food: the portions are huge and the food is delicious. I have tried their lamb shank and beef kebab....Amazing!"}
{"text":"As usual, I was in town for business and yelped local Persian restaurants. There were many options and I decided to give this place a shot.  I am very picky when it comes to Persian food and I must say that the food here was excellent! I ordered the Soltani and it was very good! Meat was tender and rice had a good flavor.  I would definitely come back here again when I'm in town"}
{"text":"Having had a ton of persian food (especially because I live in LA), I can tell you this is the BEST Persian food I've had!!! The Koobideh is DELICIOUS!!! If you love meat, I highly recommend the beef koobideh! I also recommend getting the Shirizi salad and Mast O Khiar to eat with the meal... Oh and Tahdig was made to perfection ... Can't go wrong here. Come hungry as the portions are also generous! LOVE this place! A must go to for anyone looking to have great service and yummy food!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend American Gypsy Cafe. I stop by for lunch or dinner whenever I'm in Vegas. I have ordered pretty much everything on the menu, and I have never been disappointed. Great food, great service, great all around dining experience!"}
{"text":"The waiters are nice, customer service was good and food was decent. Overall everything was good until we got the check, completely blind sided by $40 \"entertainment\" charge, apparently since there was live music and dance there is $5 per person charge including little kids which is fine if we were advanced ahead of time, we have been here multiple time while they had the \"entertainment \" but there was no charge before"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for my buddy's retirement from the military.  (Danny, thank you for your service!)  I wanted to get away from drinking and the pool, so I headed out to the nuclear testing museum.   After leaving there, I was starving.    I looked on Yelp and found American Gypsy Cafe.   It was just a mile down the road.  perfect!  I pull up to a strange lighthouse at the front of the building.  it totally threw me for a loop.   I entered and a gentleman was seated with his feet up behind the host station.   It was a little warm in there, but they quickly turned on the AC.  I sat by the window.  I looked at the menu and my eyes got huge.   I haven't had good Persian food since I left Los Angeles.   I saw tadig with ghormeh sabzi and had to order it.  I also ordered the chicken kubideh.     I could have ordered one or the other and be satisfied.   Instead, I was served enough food for 4.  Challenge accepted.  The tadig was crunchy.  The ghormeh sabzi had great flavor.   If they had given me one of the dried limes, I would have been overjoyed.     My chicken kubideh platter was enormous.  I had asked for half rice and half salad.   I ended up leaving the majority of the rice because I was already full when my food was brought to me.  I was also going to head to the Pinball Hall of Fame, so didn't want leftovers in the car.   I tucked in.     I nearly cried the food was so good.   Service was good.   When I'm back in Vegas, I will most definitely eating here again."}
{"text":"The food is great. Sometimes is too oily!  They are nice and their service is good as long as they are not busy but if  they get busy they can't handle every one accordingly.  But overall is good."}
{"text":"My Persian friend recommended this new place to me. The food portion was huge and my Persian friends loved it. I don't know bout you but I am coming back when I'm in the area! Get the beef koobideh!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place when I was in Vegas and it was amazing. All the meat dishes I have order were incredibly juicy and tender, that melt in your mouth and there was so much flavor. And the stuff was very friendly and attentive. I will definitely come back more often when I'm in town. Been to many place but by far no other place is good as this place ."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant: They hide the entrance door pretty well, but once you find it! Terrific! Nice atmosphere Persian music in the background, to accompany you while you're eating their delicious Persian food, I had sultano beef kebab, exquisitely tender beef meat served with an excellent basmati rice! I'm no fan of rice, but they master its cooking! All this served with the most charming Turkish lady, and her divine smile... I strongly recommend this restaurant which I was invited in by my Persian friend who considers it authentic !"}
{"text":"I was at this cafe a few days ago since I was in the area. I love middle eastern food and have been to almost every Persian restaurant in Vegas so I wanted to give this place a try. The kebabs were inedible. Tastes stale and overly salted. Not just a little overly salted as almost every restaurant puts too much salt but this was way way way too salty. The only positive side was that it wasn't too expense."}
{"text":"Celebrating the new year was extra special at American Gypsy Cafe!  Fresh food and great ambiance. Excellent service for a busy night."}
{"text":"Opened within the last year. Generous lunch with complex but delicious flavors. Staff is terrific. A return is in the works soon..."}
{"text":"So happy to of found this restaurant on yelp. Have passed by so many times and never knew there was a Mediterranean restaurant there. Truly a hidden gem. It's a Persian restaurant and I had the beef kabobs which were moist, tender and very flavorful. The hummus is homemade and delicious unlike anything Ive ever had before perhaps because everything I've had came from a jar?  My mother had the lamb shank which came in a savory rich broth and was also very good. We had it with the yogurt drink which is sour and savory and went perfectly with our meals. Highly recommend this place as the ambience is lovely and the service is excellent!!!"}

{"text":"Tried this place when I was in Vegas, and it was amazing. All of the meat dishes were incredibly juicy and tender, and there was so much flavor. Furthermore, the staff was very friendly and attentive. I will definitely come back here more often whenever I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"It was a nice place in a very odd spot. Hard to find entrance and I don't think their vents work very well in kitchen since it was extremely smokey when we walked in. They don't have fountain soda only cans, so no free refills. The food was ok. Not anything I really think we would go back for though."}
{"text":"This place is great. Quiet during our visit. Great service. Awesome food. Definitely coming back. As a Persian, that's saying a lot. Had the hummas, chicken kabob and beef kabob"}
{"text":"After a long day of house hunting and being extremely hungry. We used Yelp to find something good good to eat.  We found this wonderful new restaurant with foods we've never tried before. We had the Soltani Chicken Kabob combination plate with Chicken Breast & Chicken Koobideh. Sorry to say I didn't take a pic of our wonderful meal.  Tonight on Friday evening they had live music playing. Tomorrow night (Saturday night) they will have live music and Belly Dancers. We're looking forward to seeing that sometime soon."}
