{"text":"Boy did we score tonight, we belong to Ruffino's rewards club. We received an e-mail with their summer special menu starting Sunday,as reward members they let us come tonight for the special.We shared an appetizer the quantity and quality that we always get, we had a salad, a main entree and we shared a desert.All that for $37.95. The last time we were there it cost me $100 for basically the same items. The special runs Sunday- Thursday thru September, I know my wife and I are going back."}
{"text":"Went here the first time today and I have to agree with most of the comments.  The food was good but the decor is definitely from the 80s. The thing that set it apart for me was the service.  We were personally greeted from the manager and he came back after the meal to make sure that everything went well.    Water was always filled and bread basket was always full.  Everyone was great to our 11 month old daughter and put us at ease for leaving some spaghetti on the ground."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, delivery was fast, food was hot.  We will order again for delivery.  Loved eating such delicious food in front of the TV in our casual clothes!"}
{"text":"This place is old school cool.  Dimly lit, white tablecloths, jazz band playing in the background...and yes the food will keep you coming back!  Great place to take a date."}
{"text":"Ruffino's has become our destination for dinner with out of town guests!  I am gobsmacked at the reviews comparing them to Olive Garden or other chain Italian restaurants.  Those reviewers must have dead taste buds!  Made daily with sauce from scratch, I highly recommend the Fettuccine Alfredo.  It is comparable to pasta that I have had in Italy, and always consistently  delicious."}
{"text":"Our family absolutely loved our night here! Celebrating our son's 15th birthday, and they could not have been more welcoming and accommodating! Everything was wonderful, and we felt like a member of the family as we left. Will be back, absolutely!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Italian dining...great atmosphere, friendly and helpful service, impeccible food.  I thought the Veal Ruffino was was one of the best entrees I've ever had.  The hostess was a lot of fun, too.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Trattoria D'Amico last night and had a wonderful meal. The food was excellent and the staff was knowledgeable and charming. From one local business owner to another we can really appreciate the attentiveness to detail and care that is put not only into each plate but the entire dining experience. A true gem in Ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"A little disappointed with this place because we were expecting phenomenal Italian food with all the 5 star reviews, and really it was just average food, no better than Olive Garden or Buca di Beppo, but pricier. We drove 30 miles to try this place because of the reviews, and spent over $60 on an appetizer, two entrees, and two non-alcholic beverages. That was most disappointing because we could have gone somewhere closer to home and more reasonably priced for the same quality of food. The food wasn't bad, it just definitely wasn't 5 star worthy or worth the 30 mile drive or paying $20 more than we could have at another Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"The restaurant had the decor of a stuffy, old fashioned Italian place, so my expectations were a little low. The salad was very fresh and good, a tip-off of good things to come. I persuaded my sister to order the Carbonara, which the waitress said was made in a big wheel of cheese flambé. Really didn't get it, but too interesting to pass up. Wow! One of the owners brought out a cart with a huge wheel of cheese that had a depression in the center. He poured the creamy pasta into the center, which was aflame from some type of alcohol. He tossed the pasta for about 5 minutes in the flaming cheese while it picked up a rich glaze of Parmesan. The dish was terrific. I ordered a Pasta Arrabica (?) with sausage and artichokes, and a friend ordered eggplant Parmesan. All were great. Service was also attentive, and the owner was delightful. Highly recommended and looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I thought this restaurant was pretty good.  It had plenty of Italian Cuisine, but after I left and I was driving home, I hit every red light for at least 2 miles!  Why!    5 Stars."}
{"text":"Had been going to this place for 28 years.  It changed owners and names a year and a half ago.  What a sad day.  The new owners are lovely.  Their food, is not.  Ruffinos did well because of their menu, which is American Italian.  The new owners, from Italy, changed the menu to a more traditional Italian.  I've been to Italy, love Italy Italian, but here, I want my American Italian - veal parmigiana, fettucine alfredo and Ruffino's melt-in-your-mouth garlic bread (they did all three to perfection).  It would have been simple to keep the staples that the customers love, and simply add more.  But, alas, the new owners did away with the best items on the menu.  Not going back.  We gave it a few shots, and were sorely disappointed each time."}
{"text":"The service at this Trattoria D'Amico is quite good. But we go to restaurants for food, right? Unfortunately beyond the service, it's all downhill.   Ambience is quite subdued, although more aptly put, the atmosphere is like a morgue. Even with the live piano playing, it's still a restaurant in a strip mall that's replaced overhead fluorescents with recessed canned lights.   The only thing worse than the ambience is the food. The Italian food served at Trattoria D'Amico like most Chandler area establishments is amateur Italian. This is the worst of the lot.   Food lacks in flavor(tasteless and signs of a home schooled completely out of his league), presentation(pasta was scooped into a bowl and placed upside down on serving plate, I don't even plate food like that at home not to mention lack of garnishing) freshness and quality of ingredients(lots of pre-prepped food why not just go to the frozen food section of your local super market). Prices were outrageously priced given the quality of food. Any Italian restaurants bread and butter is a bolognese sauce. If you can't get that right, you're in trouble.   All I can say is yuck, why are they still in business, why isn't there a competent chef, why does this place get 4 stars and why do people continue to frequent this place? Food from the airplane is better, and that's sad. These cooks have no business being in the kitchen and these owners have no business being in business. Period."}
{"text":"Situated on the northest corner of Warner Road and 48th Strret in Ahwatukee (Phoenix).  Although located in a strip mall, once inside, you'll forget that your in a strip mall.  Ruffino's is quiet and dark inside, great for a couple looking for a good meal or just to talk.    The food is excellent, assuming you like Italian food.  The service is great and the staff seem to know if you are there to get to know each other.  In other words, they know when to leave you alone.   I agree with a previous reviewer that the prices are a little steep, so it's not the place to go every week.  However, I've been living in the area since 1994 and Ruffino's has always been there, so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Italian restaurant in the valley. My family has been patrons for over 20 years. I am forbidden to go w/o the wife under penalty of ......   It is certainly on the pricier side, but worth it. The atmosphere is plesant esp. with the live entertainment on occasion, the staff is friendly, attentive and animated, the food has never disappointed, fresh and flavorful, we always leave on the verge of comatose because of loss of all self control.  Favorite appetizers are:  gnocchi w/ Alfredo (rich and delicious, watch out, you'll spoil your appetite).  duck raviolli (slightly lighter but none the less tasty). Fav entrees: Tortellini Ruffino (same alfredo as above),  Angel hair Pescatori (lots of seafood, and a bit of spice) On the handful of occasions we made it to desert, always devine."}
{"text":"We first frequented this restaurant nearly 30 years ago as Ruffino's. Over the years it evolved and has been under new ownership for over a year.  Last night, the restaurant was packed, with wait staff going flat out, while a two piece combo played a pleasant repetoir of popular numbers. Enjoying a bottle from the wine list, helped pass the time between the fresh bread, salad, and delicious entre. Good service and food, nice room."}
{"text":"Went in tonight for the first time since new ownership. Pleased to report it was a great experience. Greeted warmly by two the owners at the door. I had a specific table request which the accommodated without a problem. The wine list has a sufficient number of wines by the glass all $10 & under. Good mix of old & new world wines. I was only able to sample a few of the items off the menu, but the antipasto plate was very good with quality evident in the selection of meat & cheese. I also wanted to mention the bolognese sauce as it was delicious! Best I have had since That Italian Place closed. Everyone at the table enjoyed their entrees. Also wanted to mention the live music. Rebecca De La Torre & her partner Jose were playing tonight which was a real treat. They are very talented & can really entertain the room. All-in-all a great night. Can't wait to return and sample some more \"true Italian\" dishes & hospitality."}
{"text":"Took a group of 9 business associates to dinner at Ruffino, everyone but me from out of town.  A couple of my guests had been to Ruffino before and were chomping at the bit to go back, because our experiences had been so good.  We were greeted at the door and assured that we would have 2 waitstaff to serve us.  The food was generally pretty good,  but could have been warmer.  The service was another story. Initial drink service was slow. Food service for the appetizers was agonizingly slower.  At one point, because the salad had been sitting on a tray near our table waiting to be served for 6-8 minutes, one of my guests got up and started to serve the salad herself.  The manager came over and started to help her, then the waiter came over to serve the last salad.  My salad had lettuce with lots of brown spots.  We had to ask for drink refills and for bread.  The food was warm, but not hot. We saw one waitress early on, and then the rest of the evening was taken care of by an easily distracted waiter.    This was beginning to be my \"go to\" place for taking business guests.  Guess I'll be going back to Va Bene."}
{"text":"To say in words would do an injustice to it's amazing craft of Italian food. Try to go during the week when it is not so busy.  If you love Italian food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Love it here!  No wonder it has been so successful. Its a great place to dine!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food I've ever had. The Gnocchi is very good and you can tell it's fresh. The calamari is also a must get. The squid was freshly cut and it was very crispy ans delicious. I wasn't able to eat dessert because I was very full after eating all of the amazing food. For me this is a must go to place in Arizona for Italian food."}
{"text":"First time eating here and have to say extremely impressed. At first glance felt the prices were high for pasta however after you eat the food you soon determine the quality of their ingredients.   The most impressive part was the service. Unlike so many restaurants were your server is the only person that takes care of you this place every single person takes a part. They must have topped off our water at least 10 times. Finish a plate and it's removed in seconds.   While not a bargain would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Dined there 18-20 years ago, and thought the food was great then.  Had dinner at Ruffino last night, and came away feeling the same again.    Waiter David was most helpful, with very attentive service.  Wavering between the $35 or the $65 bottle of wine, he suggested their Royalty program which gave us wine for half price (no cost for the Royalty program - just a way for them to get you in their data base.)  Oysters Rockefeller  were very generously sized and beautifully prepared.  House salad (choice of soup or salad)  that comes with the entree had a great balsamic dressing  and was a generous serving as well.  My Veal Picatta was cooked perfectly with a nicely sauteed and beautifully cut green bean and carrot mixture, along with pasta in a light tomato sauce.  The plate was most definitely full - not a lot of blank space.  She chose Linguini with White Clam Sauce as her entree, and was delighted with her selection.  We skipped dessert because we were far too full.  Bottom line, good choice on the wine (with David's help) and very good, traditional Italian fare served in hearty portions by pleasant and friendly staff with above average decor.  I've paid far more and gotten far less in comparable North Phoenix and Scottsdale restaurants..."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  Located in an obsure strip mall... I took a date to this place and the dinner, the wine, the dessert... ALL TERRIFIC.  The atmosphere is 1980's... The Soprano's... Jersey Italian.   Great place to bring a date. Great place if you're hungry and you want a wonderful meal.  And don't let the quiet exterior fool you. When we walked in... the bar area was packed and there was a nice mix and old and young dining in the dining area.   Their fresh out of the oven garlic bread was delicious and their pasta... awesome.   Give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My hubs and I went for our Anniversary this year. GREAT FOOD. FANTASTIC! The menu had so many mouth watering options it was really hard to choose! We settled on the Duck Ravioli and the Seafood Ruffino as our entrees... and the stuff mushrooms for the appetizer! OMG! EVERYTHING WAS SO GOOD! Even the garlic bread was fantastic! Got a bottle of wine to share and in the end sadly we were too full for dessert. Although their options for it sounded Amazing too!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm glad I finally had the chance to finally eat at Ruffino. Upon entering the doors, the ambiance and decor was nice. We (wife and I) were promptly greeted and escorted to our table.  The place was packed. There was also live music playing, which was nice to hear.  One thing I really liked was the salad being created and tossed to your liking at your table.   I really enjoyed the mozzarella that was on the caprese salad.  The chicken parm and pasta I ordered was excellent. I really enjoyed the sauce. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal and felt satisfied after.  My wife ordered the rigatoni and also enjoyed the food. I though the meal was a bit dry. A bit more sauce would have been better.   One thing I really noticed was the service. The waiter was great and there was also staff filling your water on a routine basis. The manager also personally came by at the end of the meal to check how things went. A nice touch.  The noise level was a bit high, but there was a large party a short distance from us, which probably contributed to the higher decibel level.  The one downside is the limited parking spots. That's a good thing that the restaurant is busy, but bad if you have trouble finding a spot.   My wife and I will definitely be back on a date night in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Unparalleled!!! Very friendly and welcoming. They care about their patrons. And the food is fresh. The lighting and music is romantic. And the food is so yummy. You must get the ravioli!!!"}
{"text":"Back again with my bookclub.  Very friendly service and great happy hour.  Get the Shrimp Martini - mmmm!"}
{"text":"I had not realized Ruffino's Italian Cuisine was under new management of Trattoria D'Amico until I arrived at the restaurant until I arrived at in the parking lot.  My story is as follows:  Tonight we made reservations for four at Ruffino's Italian Cuisine -- one of my favorite restaurants for years.  It is a classical family run Italian restaurant where you always felt welcomed.  The owner typically greeted at the door and chatted with you on the way out.  If there were ever an issue, it was taken care of immediately, with the owner always involved, and you were very satisfied when you left.  Times have changed...  Now when you pull up to the restaurant the first thing you see is a large white sign covering the business name indicating under new management.  The restaurant is now named \"Trattoria D'Amico, Ruffino Cucina Italiana\". Inside nothing has changed, no remodeling, same bar, same tables, and everything in the original positions.  Had it not been for the sign, you wouldn't know it was under new  management.     The next thing you realize there is no friendly greeter.  No one with that friendly smile who seems more interested in you, than selling you a meal.  My new impression upon entering is that it has the feel of a chain store restaurant with a minimal wage worker just interested in doing their job of getting you seated.    The restaurant was about half-full leaving many empty tables.  We were escorted to a very small table and I asked to be moved to a larger one.  This seemed to be a problem.  Finally they moved us to the same-size table in a slightly larger space so we didn't feel so cramped.  I noted through the entire dinner that the larger tables were never used and that the dining room never filled.  After waiting an unusually long time, someone dropped of a basket of bread, saying she noted we had been waiting a while -- someone would be with us soon.  We were told Izzy would be waiting on us (whom never seemed to have showed up).  After another extended wait a different waiter came to the table and said he would be our server (I don't know what happen to Izzy).    The hostess had only given us 2 menus (we had to ask for more).   We ordered some wine and asked for some more bread (I hadn't had any the first round).  Again, another long wait for the wine to be served by a third person.  Still waiting even longer, the waiter finally returned to take our orders.    The two ladies had the special for the evening (salmon) while my friend chose the chicken and I asked for Rigatoni Parm with Marinara.  I reminded the waiter for a second time that we needed more bread.      After the usual wait, the meal was delivered.  The ladies served first, then my friend.  I was given the wrong meal.  The waiter said he would have it corrected and I reminded him one more time we needed more bread.     I sat there and waited, waited, and waited....   No bread delivered, no one check on us for more drinks, as I watched everyone at the table finish their meals.  I saw the waiter a few times, but he never gazed over at our table.  Finally, when diner was complete, I caught his attention and he came over.  I asked him to cancel my order.  He responded \"I think it is ready\" and headed to the kitchen.  He immediately returned with it, and I reminded him that we needed more bread.  Another person brought that over.    My friends at the table were very gracious, encouraging me now to rush dinner, as they sensed the awkwardness.  I took my first bite an the meal was barely warm.  It had obviously sat ready for a while.  After all this, not even a manager visited our table to check on us -- and we were billed the full amount.    At no point was was their an apology for the bad service or the mistake.  I did hear a comment on how the restaurant was being slammed as I looked at the empty tables around me.  For the price of the meal, this is not the ambiance more service level I would expect.  It felt more like a Denny's...      In the past, the kindly owner always stood by the door checking in on how the meal was, and offering some small chit-chat.  The only thing at the door was a small dish of mints.  Unfortunately Rufino's has gone from my favorite restaurant to one that I will not visit again."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner. Had a glass of their Atalon, Merlot, Napa Valley California, 2003 wine and Chicken marsala.Loved it. There was live music on Saturday night and a bunch of oldies were having a great time dancing. Great ambience but a bit pricey. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"I've dined at Ruffinos numerous times. Great customer service, delicious food, amazing vibe. As soon as you walk in the door you are acknowledged. Servers are very attentive. I had the Chicken Picatta and a glass of White Zinfandel , amazing dish and their wine is also great quality. Sign up for their rewards program and you get a $20.00 of an entree for your birthday."}
{"text":"I love this place!, the new owners are so friendly and kind. Service is outstanding and music is always good. I love the food, tastes very authentic Italian ."}
{"text":"if you're looking for good italian cuisine in phoenix, look no further. delicious food just like mama makes it lol."}
{"text":"Don't know what has happened to this restaurant but was very disappointing. First of all, even though our table was close to the door in the bar area, the host did not even accompany us, but motioned where to sit. Upon ordering our drinks, we were very surprised being told there would be an extra charge for stuffed olives in my husband's martini. My husband has ordered martinis with stuffed olives at the most finest, and least popular restaurants, and never has he been told an additional cost would be charged for his request. Consequently, after waiting an unusually long time for our before dinner drinks, they were brought to our table along with my husband's soup. In the past we had often frequented Ruffino's, however with the present ownership we are likely not to return. Food was just o.k., nothing exceptional. I think Ruffino's had lost its personal flavor as the previous owners would drop by the table, ask if service and food were enjoyable and to our liking, chatted a little, and made you feel like special guests. It has been a long while that we have dined at Ruffino's, and our experience was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"This is an amazing find - an unassuming facade housing a delightful interior and lovely ambience. Our evening began with a fun exchange while making our reservation, then became even better when we arrived and were greeted warmly by the staff when we entered. Our wait staff was knowledgeable about the wine selections and informative regarding the menu, leaving us to enjoy our drink order while deciding on our dinner choice. Dinner was prepared superbly, with the sautéed vegetables being one of the stars of the meal. We declined dessert but were served a wonderful house-made limoncello to end our evening. We will make it a point to return to Trattoria d'Amico any time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Big supporter of local businesses, I decided to get Ruffino a try after recommendations from friends. Alone, I opted for a seat at the bar. The bartender did a great job accommodating my special vegetarian requests, and was attentive through the whole process of my dinner. The beautiful manager came around all guests, and engaged in a friendly conversation. The food was good, great value. Good food, good wine, good service, no complain. Overall a good experience, I understand why it is a local favorite. Will go back."}
{"text":"Very tasty Italian food.  I enjoyed the calamari and stuffed canneloni.  Place is dimly lit and a little dated but nice and intimate. Servers were cordial but not overly attentive.  Pricey, which reflects the cloth tablecloths and napkins."}
{"text":"Authentic? Italiano. Romulo the Chef was awesome and very engaging. Servers were great."}
{"text":"Ruffino is one of those restaurants you first go to and wonder why you haven't been here before.   Amazing food, outstanding service -- a favorite destination.   Great restaurant hands down! Looking for a great date night impressive dinner local, Ruffino is the place.  Robert Pfeifer"}
{"text":"Very Good! Nice people, and good food. Always recommend this place.  Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"The customer service--awesome! The food from the appetizers to the main meals--delicious & big portions! Saturday night entertainment--phenomenal!  Will I go back--YES!"}
{"text":"They have vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options, definitely worth a try and the vibe of the people are friendly! Chef been here since day one, tells you something about a place!!"}
{"text":"First visit to this establishment for lunch and it was very disappointing.   The egg fettuccine bolognese was bland and nothing special. Portion size was small. For $9 i would expect something a bit tastier.  My friend ordered the Orecchiette boscaiola and took two bites. It was round pasta with mushrooms, broccoli and sausage. Very dry. I tasted it and there WAS no flavor to it. Appropriately so the owner did not charge for it. Ordered a chicken ceasar salad to go and was charged $14, $5 of which was for the chicken and it wasn't even as large as a breast. Best part of the meal was the garlic bread. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love Trattoria D'Amico, everything is always delish, the staff is wonderful!!!! Thank you for always taking care of my customers when in town and tell them we have to go have the BEST Italian food in the valley!!!!"}
{"text":"authentic Italian dishes from the Roman (Lazio) region. A very popular dish is the Carbornara, which is prepared table-side inside a wheel of cheese. The pancetta is plentiful and smoky. It also has more than a little kick to it. Very creamy, cheesy, and generous portions as well.  There are actual Italians working here as well, which is a nice touch!  Our dining companion had the mezzamaniche gorgonzola, it also did not disappoint. I look forward to returning for happy hour and sampling the other dishes. Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place after reading the great reviews. Overall, we had a good time. Friday night included live performances and the musicians were truly amazing! Their voices were harmonious and added to the restaurant experience in a positive way. I had the basic spaghetti and meatballs while my husband had lasagna. I must say that lasagna was delicious! He was supposed to share it with me, but it was gone before I could ask for a bite. My meatballs were sorta basic and frozen food tasting, but the spaghetti pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce was flavorful. I like the family Italian dining experience this restaurant provided. Great experience."}
{"text":"We're from out of town and found this restaurant on yelp. I got the spinach cannelloni and all I can say is WOW!"}
{"text":"Have never had a bad meal here in the 4 times I've been.  We usually sit in the bar.  I live just down the street and having a good local italian place is great.  The mussels with red sauce and bread is excellent.   The drinks are good and the wine selection is more than adequate.  Old school interior the way I like it.   The servers are attentive and on the nights I've been here, attractive.   Live entertainment on fridays and saturdays is a bonus.   Not cheap but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"My wife & I went on a Monday, and Ruffino was not very busy. The service was excellent from the minute we walked up to the door. Our server Tina was friendly, and we had frequent visits from the receptionist and the sommelier, which fit our mood. My wife had the salmon special with caper sauce, and I had the veal piccata; both were delicious. The dinners came with garlic bread, tossed green salad, rigatoni, and vegetables, all very tasty. If you sign up with them, you will receive a card which offers the second entree for half off, or second dinner free on your birthday. We left the restaurant very happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"The food was great - we LOVED the bacon wrapped scallops, the thin & flaky bread, and my husband had the meat stuffed tortellini - very good. I had the eggplant parm - not so good. Though the restaurant itself is dated and in need of freshening, the service was wonderful! We'll definitely go back, though I'll be ordering something other than the eggplant."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, we started with the Calamari & Ouster Rockefeller all I can say is Oh my Gosh! Then my Daughter and I shared had the Duck Ravioli it was to die for. My Husband had Seafood Ruffino and my Son had the Fettuccini Ruffino.  The best part of our experience was the beautiful classic Jazz music of Dr. Jesse McGuire,  that set the tone of the evening. It was just the right volume we could have a nice conversation and his voice was like butter.  Can wait to go back again."}
{"text":"This place is in dire need of a makeover. When we stepped into this local joint, we were immediately transported back to the 80s. Also, it's pretty dark in there. The dining area was very slow for a Friday night, but there was a lively crowd and live music in the bar area. Between the strong reviews and the old school vibe, I was hoping for a classic, old school Italian meal. It wasn't bad for the East Valley, but not the best I've ever had. We ordered the mussels in white wine sauce as a starter. It was delicious. For dinner, I ordered the linguine with clams. It was a little salty, but loaded with clams and quite flavorful. My husband ordered the spaghetti with seafood with white wine sauce. He said it was good but not great. We finished the meal with the house made tiramisu. It was ok, but the lady fingers weren't even soaked and there was no chocolate. Not worth the $9 price tag. Overall, we had a pleasant meal with very attentive service."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery twice now and haven't been disappointed.  On both occasions my order was delivered before the quoted arrival time. Both were piping hot and fresh!  I was impressed that they included bread and a side salad or small soup just as if I were visiting their establishment.   I've tried two different entrees so far;  linguine with clam sauce was my first order and capellini toscana the second.  Both were delicious. The linguine was al dente and topped with fresh clams. Sauce tasted home made with just the right balance of seafood taste and creaminess. The capellini wasn't as al dente as the linguine but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Spicy Italian sausage provided a counterpoint to the savory sun dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts.   All in all my delivery experience has been positive and I'll be ordering again soon."}
{"text":"First time we have been here since the change of ownership.  Took advantage of the Saturday night happy hour.  Bruschetta and mushroom caps are very good!  We also had the Cannelloni off the dinner menu and would recommend as well.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place!!! My husband and I went here all the time back when Kevin ran the place. We have seen it go through many changes but it always seemed to bounce back on top.  However I won't be going back any more.  I made reservations several days in advance for my daughters 18th Birthday and from the moment we arrived the service was horrible. Waited at the doorway for several minutes before being greeted and then a waiter took us to our table. No warm greeting for us! The table was horrific ...in the absolute worse location in a busy isle right by  kitchen doorway. When I asked if we could be seated somewhere else & that I had made reservations several days ago, the waiter was quite rude and stated that they were very busy and everyone else had made reservations as well. He finally offered another location but stated it would be just as bad.  We just sat where we were.   (Btw, half the restaurant was empty) Several times staff ran into the back of my chair and not once did they say excuse me.   The service was fair....we had empty water glasses most of the dinner. Waited for a very long time for our food and one meal had been forgotten.  The food was ok-not fabulous. Maybe it was the entire experience.   I made a big deal from the beginning of making reservations that it was my daughters 18th birthday-not until we were leaving did the waitress even say Happy Birthday.   We have spent a lot of money here and always enjoyed coming....no more. Such a shame..."}
{"text":"We don't go to this restaurant anymore.  When we first went there, the food was fabulous, but not anymore.  The owners have an attitude and they changed the menu.  The food is not good anymore.  We will never go back there again."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time eating at Ruffino's although we have lived in Ahwatukee for 15 plus years.  I am so bummed that we have not eaten here before... It was delicious!  I had the seafood  Ruffino which was amazing with lobster bisque before my meal.  The bisque was good (but I have to say that Capital Grill takes the cake for that). However the seafood Ruffino was amazing.  Mussels,  clams,  shrimp,  calamari,  Angel hair pasta with a marinara sauce... Perfection.    My husband had the crab stuffed salmon... It doesn't get any better and he loved it.    My son had their Alfredo tortellini and if he hadn't eaten so much garlic bread served before the meal (and his own cup of lobster bisque) he would have cleaned his plate.   Overall a great value for the quality and atmosphere.    A great Friday night end of the week treat.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The ambiance the greeting was clear cut amazing.  Start to finish every part of our meal was made with love"}
{"text":"Wow! We had dinner this evening and I was blown away by the experience we had. The service was amazing, the food was delicious, and they were very careful not to put cheese in my food because I can't have lactose. This is definitely a five star experience for us this evening and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"We had a great time tonight with long time friends/family.   Great oysters, wonderful salmon and pasta  Capped our night off with lemon cello..... unbelievable! Highly recommended for great food and conversation."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places!  Wonderful service and delicious food!  Stuffed mushrooms and escargot are a couple of our favorites to start and we love the Caesar salads and bisque. Every entire we've had has been delicious!  Thank you Ruffino!"}
{"text":"Our second visit was excellent, as was the first. If you want Italian, this is the real deal, and for lovers of pasta a la carbonara, watching it made table-side inside a hollowed-out cheese wheel is a special treat."}
{"text":"This restaurant has definitely changed from when I remember it back when it was ruffino. Clearly the owners and the food has changed for the worst. It's going to be sad to see such a place that was amazing, go bad."}
{"text":"Ruffino Italian Cuisine has become a favorite for dinner since 2003. The food is consistently delicious and they offer NON-WHEAT pasta. Although, I am disappointed they have caved to the ranch raised fish--Cod and Salmon propaganda.  The wait staff is well-trained, efficient, courteous and accommodating beyond the call of duty."}
{"text":"Was there last week. Had not had awesome Italian food like we had since living in Connecticut. Give it my highest reccomendation. Muscles are to die for and the marsala dishes were greatly"}
{"text":"They have an authentic feel and taste! The food is spectacular and I totally suggest this to any food fanatic!"}
{"text":"Have NOT been a huge fan of Italian food; HOWEVER, went to D'Amico with a large group (40+)... The service was unbelievable, especially with this large of group; the large menu had a wide variety of choices (which is also unusual for serving this large of group); the Trattoria D'Amico food has made me a convert... I now like Italian food!!!  The entire group enjoyed the service; the meal, the atmosphere and the entire evening! Well Done!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Recently dined here for my birthday.  Absolutely the best Italian meal I have had in Phoenix.  The menu has been updated since the new owners from Rome came over, and it is definitely an upgrade from the prior.  the house special that night of spaghetti carbonara made in a giant cheese wheel was unbelievable, as was the gnocchi and penne amitriciana the others at our table ordered.  Excellent service as well.  Will most definitely be back"}
{"text":"This is a great place to have a drink at the bar or experience fine food and service in the dining room. We are lucky to have this restaurant in an area where good/unique restaurants are few and far between.  The food is awesome... the lasagna is addicting!"}
{"text":"My man brought me here for date night and I couldn't have been more pleased. We shared a nice bottle of wine in a quiet private dimly lit area by ourselves an dined on amazing Italian food. I saw another diners plate of spaghetti and meatballs and just had to order it, it was love at first bite. Perfect place for a romantic date!"}
{"text":"I have been to Ruffino's for drinks a few times, but I cannot believe I waited so long before actually dining here!  I had an INCREDIBLE dinner last night at Ruffino's - Escargot for an Appetizer, Cannelloni for Dinner...and all I can say is \"WOW.\" My first bite of the Cannelloni was like a taste explosion! Very complex flavors. I've only had Escargot once before at Cafe Boa. I don't remember loving it - but I can say I'd definitely order it again now! It's served in a butter/garlic sauce at Ruffino's inside of mushroom caps. Excellent.  I thought the prices were very affordable. It's obvious the pasta is hand made. The sauces are extremely fresh. You get what you pay for!  It truly is a sophisticated place. Who would guess by the location in a strip mall?? Fresh flowers on the table, great service, live singer on a Wed. night.  Classic. All that was missing was Frank Sinatra sitting in the corner. But the live singer made up for that (on a Wednesday night even!)"}
{"text":"Amazing! Incredible!  The pesto linguine, the Pinot Grigio, the bruschetta was awesome! A new neighborhood favorite for me."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was slow. Water and tea refills limited to manger doing it. NO entertainment that the website showed. In defense of the service, bartender had to keep bar going as well as service tables. Should have had another server."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a typical (and I mean typical in every sense of the word) American Italian restaurant.  Let's see:  - Cheesy Italian music subtly playing in background - Check - Wood Paneling and faux crystal light fixtures, reminding you eerily of the 80's - Check - Pleasant but not overbearing waiters/waitresses in black-n-whites - Check - Salad and Garlic Bread with everything - Check  Now, as to the food we ordered, the Bruschetta was nicely toasted, with a garlicy tomatoe mix on top - very nice.  Then came the salad, which is tossed table side - a nice touch.  However, the greens tasted like they were straight out of a bag.  No-one takes a free salad seriously any more.  This was followed with warm garlic bread - the french baguette they were using for this had been squashed and went cold very quickly.  Cold garlic bread that doesn't taste of garlic sounds like cold toast to me.  On to the main courses.  My companion and I both had \"signature dishes\" - I had the Duck Ravioli, which was accompanied by a tomato cream sauce, and she had the Shrimp linguine, which was also pleasant.  All-in-all, this was a pleasant evening.  The food was reasonable, and the environment non-obtrusive.  The \"free\" accompaniments brought the meal down a notch - get rid of the garlic bread and salad unless asked for (and when they are asked for - make them shine - it's not that hard), and you have a five-star place."}
{"text":"When first walking into this restaurant, I was wowed. It's not your typical Phoenix restaurant. There was white table cloth. The waiters were all formally dressed.  It had a live jazz singer.  I was a little taken aback because it has the ambience of a fine steak restaurant like a Donovans as opposed to a nice Italian restaurant.  It was a nice change of scenery from your usual west coast trendy yet casual Phoenix restaurant ambience.   The service was also excellent.  Our waiter was hyper animated which was a little annoying yet appreciated because he was attentive.  Overall the service was nearly perfect. All the waiters had manners and were old school in their mannerism. Again, this was a welcome change from the trendy young stud or hot girl who act like they are too cool to be serving tables.   In regards to the food....DISAPPOINTING.  I was really shocked. I really wanted to like this place but the food had no flavor.  There is nothing about the food that would make one want to go back.  The eggplant parmegan was sloppy and watery egglant that tasted like boiled egglant.  The tortalleni ruffino was served in an alfredo sauce that tasted like potato soup poured onto pasta. It was so thick and tasteless. The tortelini had no flavor and it's filling was bland.   The restaurant does some things to provide one with a homely feel. They serve garlic bread toasts as free appetizers and constantly refresh it. The jazz music in the background was also a nice touch.  Stil the atmosphere was a bit claustrophobic for me."}
{"text":"Long time customer of Ruffino's, first time back after the ownership change.  Went on a weeknight with my in-laws, who have been coming here since the original owner.  Food was better, in my opinion, via the use of fresher ingredients and more careful preparation/cooking.  It looks like they are gradually making their own subtle changes to the menu with fresher and/or homemade ingredients.  All the staff was very friendly and one of the new owners, Claudia, went to each and every table to make sure everything was perfect.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A treat for the tastebuds.  Start with freshly homemade Italian bread dipped in virgin olive oil with a splash of balsamic vinegar.  Have a delicious house salad with homemade Italian or bleu cheese dressing.  If you choose the soup, it will be robust and flavorful.  Then feast on a delicious entree. (You may not have room for dessert.)  I loved Fettucine D'Amico made with a mixed sauce of tomato, brown and cream sauce and sliced homemade Italian sausage. It's different in a sublime and tastebud tantalizing way.  Fresh blackened cod was fresh, perfectly spiced and cooked so it was moist and flaky.  This restaurant is a notch above any Italian restaurant I've been to since my arrival in Arizona. The server, Pashay, was wonderful. The food was prepared by an expert in Italian cuisine.   I shall return on a Saturday night when they have live music in the bar."}
{"text":"Meh Went in after work on Friday night Sat at the bar. Nice jazz trumpeter playing at a decent level in the background.  Ordered wine and dinner. Area not cleaned in front of me, obvious that a person just left because previous check sitting in front of me until I pushed it all the way up to the bar. Bar accessories in the way of my wine glass and water (straws, napkins) - can I have some personal space please (lol).  Food arrived well before napkin and placemat. I like to think that I won't drop bread on my lap, but I am drinking a glass of wine!  Garlic bread was flat (like sitting under a heater for a while, devoid of freshness). Salad was basic greens with a lot of olive oil and not much else. Pasta with homemade sausage was fair- not a lot of flavor (recommended by bartender). Brocolli was well prepared.  Service at the bar was 2/5 stars. Bartender was overworked with volume, he had to ask for help. Still would of appreciated a \"how was that meal\" question.  Overall average. Heard there were new owners so wanted to try. I like the idea of independent owners. Lots of Italian places in Ahwatukee, so competition is high. Might try again after new owners have more changes in menu."}
{"text":"Promptly seated tonight. Waiter was great and we took his recommendation for the carbonara. It was very very rich , but he warned us of this before. The calamari we had was spot on and probably up there with being absolutely perfectly cooked. Finished with a creme brûlée and it was a good size for the price . Overall great experience and not overly priced"}
{"text":"The staff is amazing! Super friendly and very accommodating. They were especially nice to our children. This is a nice old school Italian restaurant but with duck ravioli - and it was great! We're on vacation but I would recommend to locals."}
{"text":"I placed an order for delievery Lasagna, and Gamberi al Forno.  I knew it was going to be terrible when I opened the cheap containers.  The Lasagna terrible, how can anyone mess up Lasagna.  Stouffers Lasagna would out win this Lasagna any day.  The shrimp were so small sitting in basic oil.  The bread terribly hard, to the point I didn't want to hurt my teeth...two thumbs down...why did I bother?  $40.00 a waste.  Highly not recommended!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here yesterday for New Years Eve dinner. I have wanting to try this place out for months! All I can say is that this place is awesome!!! We ordered the bruschetta for an appetizer, my husband got the table side pasta flambé, and I ordered the lasagna. All were delicious! This is real Italian food people, not Olive Garden!!! Service was great, we had a gal with long dark hair. Sorry forgot her name but she did a great job. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in AZ. Amazing service and everything in delicious. For weekend nights makes sure you have a reservation! People love this place"}
{"text":"My pasta dish was ok but had about an entire cup of oil in it. It was seriously soaked in oil. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch yesterday for the first time and were back tonight for happy hour, yep two days in a row... it is that good!!! The food is outstanding but we're having a hard time deciding if it's better than the service because it is amazing as well! Probably our new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. The pasta was delicious! The decor is slightly outdated, but overall ambiance wasn't too bad. Great food and amazing service"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Trattoria D'Amico.  The first was for dinner to celebrate an anniversary.  This visit was for lunch.  Both visits were outstanding.  The staff was friendly and provided excellent service.  The new owners obviously are very serious about providing a great dining experience for their customers.  My wife and I had pasta dishes the first visit and I had pasta and my wife had the Caprese appetizer for lunch.  All the meals were delicious, fresh, and with subtle twists in the ingredients that made the dishes stand out from other Italian restaurants we frequent.  The Crème Brulee was the best we ever had.  In fact, every dish we had was the best we've ever had.  This will be our first choice for Italian from now on.  Thank you, D'Amico family, for settling in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant 1 star, only because my entree was actually good. Otherwise, it would have been a zero star review. Everything there could use a lot of improvement. Upon arriving we were greeted by a hostess who seemed to be confused about where to seat us, although the restaurant was mostly unoccupied, with the exception of the small bar area. This led to her being bickered at by what ended up being our waitress. We were then seated by the manager with no menus. I went to the ladies room to wash my hands before our meal, where I was enjoying the lovely music.... just as it was abrubtly turned off. There was no music for the rest of our visit. When we finally got some menus (and bread upon request), we ordered some drinks. I ordered a rum and coke, and my date ordered a coffee. Don't let their happy hour advertising fool you! There is NO HAPPY HOUR at Ruffino's restaurant. Although they do have a happy hour in the small bar area, if you sit even 10 feet away from it, you do not get to enjoy the special drink prices. I was misled and ended up paying full price for a drink, that if ordered a few feet away would have been half price! My date's coffee came out lukewarm, and when our appetizers arrived I had wished I ordered something else. My dates salad was pretty tasty, but my tortellini en brodo soup was awful. It was some chicken bouillon water with overcooked pasta, that had no hint of the meat it had suggested existed in it. Our entrees arrived quite a while later, and our table still hadn't been bussed since the appetizers. Both of our entrees were pretty darn tasty, but both were only lukewarm again. Not hot at all. Then there was a baby screaming with no music playing to distract me from the wailing infant. The waitress was snippy and seemed to be in a bad mood. And even with a lady following the waitress around for training, couldn't seem to bring out a box for my food and a requested cup of coffee. The service was just slow and almost snotty. So, I really wouldn't recommend it. It is too overpriced for a place with a hit and miss menu and very poor service. Also, I ordered the Chicken Florentine, which is supposedly a stuffed chicken breast. But, it was actually only just topped with the ingredients listed. It also doesn't come with a knife, so I had to attempt cutting it up with a butter knife. Still pretty good, especially after I took it home and made it hot."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try since it was under new owners from prior as Ruffino's . We sat at bar, very busy night. We ordered drinks they were fine  Ordered off Happy Hour menu, not so fine. Ordered 3 appetizers, and waited over an hour and half before all 3 had been served.  Service for food was extremely sloooow! One appetizer was a \" Jumbo\" shrimp cocktail- price $16.00! I decided to give it a try because of it being JUMBO SHRIMP.....WRONG  IT WAS 6 small shrimp dangling from one JUMBO parfait glass.  Extremely over priced. I could have went to Eddie V and gotten a truly much nicer shrimp cocktail for much less.  Was not impressed with the food.  Bartender was nice, service slow, and shrimp cocktail was a failure like the food service.  Won't be back. Miss the great service, and food when it was Ruffino's..."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Ruffino last Friday around 4pm , thought it would be a great happy hour start for the weekend. Our plan was to order a glass of wine & Oysters Rockefeller, and we did. Teresa, whom I believe is the owner, was working the bar and looked like kitchen help. Her black outfit (uniform) was very unattractive and it looked like she'd been cleaning a house all day long. You would think she would look nice since she's serving the guests. The restrooms were playing wonderful Italian Music, Dean Martin was playing when I was in there, but out in the dining area there was THUMP THUMP music...really? This is an Italian restaurant, where's the ambiance? If I wanted THUMP THUMP/ hip hop, I'd not pick an Italian restaurant. Maybe we should have sat in the bathroom? Oh...but it gets better. A young man, teens, brought in the trash cans from outside, as in 'big round trash bins,' one in each hand, right through the lounge where we were sitting in the booth, one of the trans cans almost rubbed my husband's right arm.  A few minutes later, the young man went out again and brought a 3rd one in, the same way! No lids on the trash cans, just big old dirty trash cans being brought in through the front door - OMG, REALLY? This would break so many regulations - don't ya think? GROSS! How dirty and germy. The wine was just ok, and the Oysters Rockefeller were the worst ever. There were 6, and they were tiny and pathetic looking. They were edible, and we ate them, for $20 - you better believe we ate them, but they are not in any league to even be called Oysters Rockefeller.  My gosh, go to DURANTS and order theirs, THAT'S OYSTERS ROCKEFELLER. Ruffino didn't even have cheese on theirs. The presentation failed drastically. They sat these sad looking 'things' on a wilted bed of iceburg shredded lettuce. You know, the more I think about it, I shouldn't have paid, and I shouldn't have eaten them. We just should have walked out and said \"REALLY?\"  I even left a tip, that's how stupid I am. She didn't deserve a tip, because besides the fact the food was a joke, she didn't come by ONCE, to ask how things were. Didn't even ask if we wanted another drink - nothing. We finally had to flag her down for the check. $33 for what? I felt sick when we left there. Oh well, you never know what you're gonna get, right? We went it happy - looking forward to get our Friday on, and left in different spirits. Felt ripped off and very disappointed. I can tell you that 10 years ago this restaurant was the best in town. It's changed hands long since and is not even comparable anymore.  My amazement is, 1.  How can you allow food to leave your kitchen looking as this dish did? No presentation at all?  2. Do you not know what Oysters Rockefeller are? These didn't look or taste like them. Call them baked oysters, or something, but not Rockefeller, c'mon. Giving 1 star only because you have to chose at least 1. Otherwise, it's a negative number."}
{"text":"We had been to this restaurant in years past and had a chance to go again Saturday night. It is new ownership since we've been there however we were extremely pleased with the  staff, the food, the atmosphere and we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Favorite vendor business dinner spot near my work. Someone wants me to sell their products? Meet me at Ruffinos"}
{"text":"Skip it and go somewhere else. The food is only average. The service was bad . For the prices they charge I expect more. I'm really surprised at all the good reviews. I'm wondering if the others have had good Italian food before."}
{"text":"Four of us went on a Saturday night and enjoyed a relaxing meal. Service was a little inconsistent but the food was good. The place was busy but not noisy. I was pleasantly surprised to see an Aperol Spritz on the cocktail menu which made for a great start to the meal.  We shared Calamari and a Shrimp Cocktail to start which were fresh and delicious.For the Main Courses, we chose Lasagna (delicious), Piccata di Pollo (tender & flavorful with nicely cooked vegetables), and the Linguine Alle Vongole (which was a bit salty as other reviewers have noted). Dessert was Cheesecake and Creme Brulee which were a nice, light way to finish off the meal. The wine list featured a good variety of reasonably priced wines."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was dark, old (furniture) Italian style. Really over priced. If you would like to compete with chain restaurants that are consistent with their food, at least have the quality of food to stand by the prices you are charging customers. For 2 customers to have 2 bud lights, an appetizer, lasagna and chicken marsala should not cost $70.00. Not worth it, at all. Food was sub par at best. Waitress was nice and attentive, not her fault the food is over priced and normal at best. Hard earned money down the drain. Never going back."}
{"text":"First visit to ruffinos. Nice atmosphere friendly staff. Food I had the veal parmigian dinner  pasta Fajoul soup and fried breaded cheese sticks and calamari for appetizers. . Mozzarella cheese sticks average to good . Calamari average at best. Soup average at best. Veal parmigiana on the chewy tough side with a bland but fresh American style flavor. Pasta bland sauce also. Vegetables first time accompanied that dish not tasty. Add it up for myself waste of money $136 dollars $25 tip for 3 dinners.waitress had the nerve to charge to refill one glass of coke filled with ice. Wife ordered the worst eggplant she ever tasted. Under cooked raw inside. When I took one bite water came out like a water Mellon. yech. Sauce was also  bland and not enough cheese she commented. Our guest from panama had shrimp scampi for her birthday which they didn't recognize her birthday nor give 2 cents about her. She left over the medium to small shrimp, need I say moe. All totaled a total waste of money $136.00 plus $25 tip. If you are looking for authentic italian go eat at AVANTI or ROMA GARDENS FOR NY OR BROOKLYN OLD WORLD STYLE COOKING. They are the best of the best , costs a little more but you get perfectly delicious veal and eggplant and appetizers. I'd rather pay more for perfect than save a little money for average. Ruffino totally disappointed after looking foward to eating there because of reviews. Bland American style is how I sum up the food. Wasn't the worst, far far away fromthe best unfortunate. NOT AN ENJOYABLE DINNER 2 1/2 STARS.  Generic ITALIAN  COOKED FOR THE MASSES WITHOT FLAVOR."}
{"text":"I just got delivery and the food was just OK.  Chicken Marsala was decent nothing special and the gnocchi pasta was bad Pasta didn't feel fresh missing those tastebuds that u would hope to experience while eating Italian food."}
{"text":"Just went there with my family for a late lunch on Wed, 6/29/11.  It was about 2:30 pm and we were happy that they were open and still serving.  We have been going to Ruffino's for over 20 years, off and on, and still like it.  I am writing this review just to give readers some recent feedback.  Ruffino has a limited menu, but pretty decent food and prices.  Nothing outstanding, but decent and worth your time if you want to try their offerings.  My wife ordered their clam linuini, lunch portion, and it was good and substantial.  My daughter ordered the lunch manicotti and that too was decent and substantial.  Lunch does not come with anything -- no veggie, no salad -- just the entree and bread.  I ordered the dinner order of veal masala and it was good and came with veggies, side pasta, and side salad.  The price was fair.  We ordered and shared an antipasti platter to share first, and it came with two kinds of cheese, two kinds of olives, artichoke hearts, ham, procuitto, salami, mortadella, sweet and hot peppers, and about four big leaves of romaine.  Pretty substantial.  So I just wanted to report that it was pretty good and we will go back, but next time on a Thurs, since Thurs is Osso Bucco day."}
{"text":"i went here the other night for the first time with a date. i am pretty blown away! i had a glass of the caramel road chardonnay.. which was AMAZING!! and i got the fettuccine Alfredo.. it was honestly the best fettuccine Alfredo i have ever had! they also have this table side salad service where they make the salad in front of you and ask what you want in it which was also superb. will be coming back here and telling friends and family about this great little treasure!! oh by the way our server was GREAT too. I forget his name (very bad with names). highly recommended!"}
{"text":"YUM.  I am a very picky Italian.  Eating pasta out is a chore for me since it's either a chain restaurant here in Phx or you have mom and pop shops catering to a very dull palate.  D'Amico's did a fine job with their entree's.  The calamari was cooked perfectly and not a heavy breading.  The Italian sausage and peppers were very tasty but the sausage lacked fennel seeds.  The ravioli's were delicious and gravy's were all seasoned well and not watery.  The place is pricey but we will be returning."}
{"text":"Nice little place.   We had the calamari appetizer and it was delicious.  It had the tentacley part which I love and the rings.  The marina sauce that comes with was really good too.  I had the angel hair pasta with sausage, artichokes and sun dried tomatoes and it was really good.  My hubby had the ravioli de mare and it was REALLY frickin good.  It was a little pricier than what I'm used to but we were there for his bday.  I pretty much only wanna eat at expensive restaurants now.  Service was good too. We will def go again!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place before the new ownership.  My most recent experience was very telling.  A table booked 24 hours in advance got us a table next to the kitchen, a very disinterested waitress, and a hostess who kept walking by our table who readied of smoke.    The saving grace of this restaurant is the duck ravioli which is amazing.  Hoping the new owners will get sort this place out."}
{"text":"Ruffino Italian Cuisine (affectionately referred to as Ruffino's) is my my wife and I's restaurant.  We first found it a number of years ago when I took her out on a nice date.  Since then, we have had our rehearsal dinner there and a number of special date nights.  The restaurant really doesn't look like a whole lot from the outside.  It is in a small strip mall nestled between a Dry Cleaner and a shoe repair shop.  On the inside it is a little dated, but the service and food more than make up for it.  When it comes to service, the wait staff is always extremely attentive.  The owner, Steve, is also great.  He is very hands on and always quick to address any concerns that may arise.   When we had our rehearsal dinner here, he helped come up with a custom menu and pricing instead of their typical event menu.  The food is amazing.  The mean starts out with fresh garlic bread that is out of this world.  For the entrée, my wife and I are extremely fond of the Filet Mignon, which is always cooked perfectly and extremely tender.  Their other entrees, like the chicken parmigiana, are also delicious.  All entrees come with pasta and veggies.    Dessert cannot be missed either.  The tiramisu is the best I have ever had.  I will DEFINITELY be heading back here again soon."}
{"text":"We really enjoy the delicious food and gracious service here. Our server last night was Israel, he was engaging, on top of service without being obtrusive, and even arranged for an off menu Veal Francese for Scott. He understood that we were celebrating my Dad's birthday posthumously and was respectful.  The dining room(s) and bar area are spacious, with votives on the table. Saturday night there was a nice jazz trio playing in the bar, and the restaurant was packed. The bartender served a perfect dry Titos Martini, up with blue cheese stuffed olives.   Started with the warm, delicious bread and good quality olive oil; the caprese salad is simple and flavorful, the sweet balsamic is thick and obviously aged. Dinner comes with salad or pasta fagioli, the latter is an admirable version. Scott is a fan of the tortellini en brodo, and enjoyed his cup. They weren't doing the house signature Pasta Carbonara in Parmesan wheel, but when they do, it is perfection. My penne con vongole was garlicky heaven, and I took some to-go. Mom thoroughly enjoyed their shrimp Scampi, and took a large portion of the accompanying angel hair pasta to-go.   We shared the tiramisu, which was light, espresso laden, the lady fingers were not at all soggy. Scott had a piece of New York style cheesecake he raved about, and I appreciated the House Limoncello appertif offered.   They have good Happy Hour selections in the bar, and this remains a favorite neighborhood restaurant offering delicious food. We are fans!  * Highly suggest reservations *"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY delicious! We had a very friendly waiter too. Much nicer than it looks from the outside, and the portions were generous."}
{"text":"This is quality homemade Italian food.  My partner and I have now eaten here twice and it's now a favorite and go-to neighborhood restaurant for good food.  I thought I had the tortellini a few weeks ago, but I didn't see it on the menu the second time.  I got the duck ravioli, and while it was different, it tasted very good.  My partner loves their lasagna and has ordered it at each visit.  While the portion sizes look small, they're actually adequate considering you're given bread and then choice of soup or salad.  I was full from the 4 ravioli you get.  While prices seem high, it is including soup or salad, and the homemade quality is worth it compared to other typical Italian restaurants.  I've been to Italy, so I know what real homemade pasta is supposed to taste like.  We have had good service, but the decor seems a little dark and dated."}
{"text":"Our friends invited us to have dinner here.  I've never heard of this place before, apparently they've been here for years!  The food is rustic Italian-American which is very rich and heavy for our taste.    First off, the scallops wrapped in bacon, was pretty good, it is an old staple in a place such as this.  Hubby ordered the Seafood Ravioli drenched in heavy cream and butter filled with chunks of seafood and cheese.  Oh, he had a side of lobster bisque...just too much!   He paired it with a Malbec, which I thought should be reserved for red meat, was I wrong.  It was perfect for cutting through the fattiness of the meal.   I thought I was safe to get the  Oyster Rockefeller, that was also topped with heavy cheese and wilted spinach.  I could even hardly taste the oysters, which was overcooked for my liking.  I've heard of Conundrum that people raved about...blech.  The worst wine I've had that cost $10 a glass.  That was not their fault, so I drank as to not waste it.  Now, the house salad was very good!  I don't remember what was in it, because it was cave-like in there.    The service was very good, eventhough the food was just so-so.  Unless that friend extends an invite, we will go again.  Otherwise...next..."}
{"text":"Back in the ol' days.. it was great!  I went back last week to check it out..  not so great.  Very dated atmosphere and an older crowd.  They do have a great wine list.  Had one cocktail, looked at the menu, and left.  No thanks!"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery thru the Yelp app a couple of times since they have been under new ownership. I can tell they have upgraded the freshness/quality of their ingredients under the new ownership. I really enjoy the Angel Hair Chx Primavera, which is in a nice olive oil garlic sauce and not a cream sauce. Lots pf veggies. Also really like the chicken piccata which comes with penne in a pomodoro or some tomatoes sauce and also a side of veggies.  I rarely get out with my husband (due to toddler) so I appreciate the delivery option of a good restaurant!"}
{"text":"We had dinner in this restaurant . Everything was awesome! Customer service, food, life music and good Italian vine.I suggest you reserve table before coming. Very nice place!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Truly.  This place for lunch is awesome.   Today I had the complimentary garlic bread And tortellini filled with meat in a alfredo, pancetta, and pea sauce  MMMMM!!!!  The tortellini was divine! Soft, fluffy meat pillows of deliciousness.  Go here.   Seriously.  $12 out the door for lunch on white tablecloths using real silverware."}
{"text":"Well so much for the hype of this neighborhood Italian restaurant. The wine I picked was good and then it went downhill from there. I ordered the linguini pasta with clams in a garlic sauce. The noodles were not good and the sauce was tasteless. Waitress brought me a replacement dish and did not charge me for it. They get 4 stars for their effort but two for their cuisine. Need to try harder folks."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant a few times before and liked it. A nice neighborhood place. So, we thought to go here to celebrate my niece's graduation. We had a party of 10 and the service was terrible.  The servers didn't bring drinks or ask if we wanted anything other than our order. They were all in a back room doing something. And the food was not good, either. I had chicken piccata - yuck. It had a thickish cream sauce - like creamy soup. Not light and lemony like it should be. I do not think I would go back."}
{"text":"The menu of appetizers, specials, entrees and desserts is about as wide a selection of Italian fare as you can find anywhere this side of the Atlantic ocean.  Service was very friendly and efficient, and the food was delicious.  A big surprise however was Sam, the gentleman playing the mandolin and sharing his love of movies and the music associated with them.  It made for an overall exceptional experience.  Will be returning ASAP."}
{"text":"Romantic setting...fabulous food... Entertaining live music! Wonderful surprise in Ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"I am just going on record stating that I visited this establishment with one Italian and one Belgium.  These guys are tough on restaurants and complained the whole week about the crappy Phoenix cuisine.   Ruffino hit a home run with both of my business colleagues.  Appetizers -   Sauteed Mussels in white garlic sauce.  Spectacular.  Hint - take the garlic bread and dip in in the sauce.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Bruscheta - old skool and tasty, the only complaint is that true Italian Bruscheta does not have Balsamic Vinegar drenched on it.  I loved it, the Euro boys did not.  Antipasto Platter - Lots of tasty stuff on this very large plate of goodies.  Soup - Reviews for Lobster Bisque were stellar.  My take - to much cream, not enough lobster chunks, in fact, none.  Tasted like cream soup.  Just not for me, I would rate in 2 stars or 5 out of 10, mediocre.  Dinner (we shared)  Veal Parmigiana - About an 7 out of 10, kind of no flavor.  Decent but not the best I have had.  Served with grill veggies, which were excellent.  Seafood Ruffino - 10 out of 10.  Just plain to die for.  Lives up to my fellow Yelpers recommendations.  Cannelloni Florentine - Excellent.  10 out of 10.  Served with a cream gravy.   Wine selection is excellent.  What impressed the Euro boys the most is the excellent Limoncello to finish off the meal.   Very happy eating, indeed."}
{"text":"We were greeted immediately and had a greeter at our table and a waitress; well done; loved the expresso  martini; had fresh catch salmon with artichokes; excellent; my wife had spaghetti bolagnese; excellent (need to work on the meatballs!).  Very friendly staff, wanted to make sure you taken care of"}
{"text":"Very good food. Went there twice for personal occasion and 1 meeting.  Always good professional service.  Asked  them to make for me  things that not on the menu and the chef actually did!"}
{"text":"Very good food. I alway appreciate hot (temp) food. Ours was.  Garlic bread melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"This may very well be what passes for good Italian food in Phoenix, but Olive Garden is cheaper.   The staff is friendly. Don't confuse that with competent. But I suppose the old folks that come here aren't exactly picky.  Tacky interior, bland food that is overpriced, and service that moves at the speed of Tectonic Plates. Which would have been saved had the food been good. Sadly, no.  Skip that bread too. It's soggy and stale. The table side salad service is just a distraction. The kitchen is in no hurry to serve up what can only be generously called Italian."}
{"text":"This place is too pricey for the quality and size of their food.  I ordered linguine with white wine clam sauce and I'm pretty sure they used canned clams.  I would much rather eat at Va Bene which is probably a 10 min drive from this restaurant. The quality of food is a lot better and fresher.  Also the waiter here wasn't too competent and service is incredibly slow for a non-busy night."}
{"text":"I went her for Valentine's Day dinner with my girlfriend.  First off, they were able to accommodate a reservation request day of (silly me forgot to make a dinner plans prior to the big day), which was a pleasant surprise.  We started the evening off with a glass of the House Red which was delicious.  We then moved to the table fifteen minutes before our reserved time which was another pleasant surprise.    This is not a place for a cheap date.  The atmosphere is very nice and makes you feel like you are dining at a very fine establishment.  The food was excellent and the service was great.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a really nice Italian dining experience."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Stopped one day for lunch. Was soo good, we came back for dinner the next day. Owners/chef are actually from Italy.  Meals were fantastic, and a great value also. It is a must go!! Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Tried this place a couple of times since the new ownership. Tonight sealed the deal and we won't be back. Not horrible but just not that good.   Orecchiette with broccoli and sausage was promising on the menu but very underwhelming. Don't even ask me about the presentation. Let's just say the sausage needs to be cut or chopped before throwing on the plate.   The gnocchi served in marinara was tasteless  Overall, prices are relatively expensive for the quality of the food and wine.   The good? Complimentary limoncello, friendly service, salmon special, great bread.   Oh well. We'll continue to search for a great Italian place in the Ahwatukee area."}
{"text":"We've been to Ruffino's a few times and have taken friends with us each time. Everyone in the group thoroughly enjoyed the fine service and food, and said they would return again. Large, fresh salads are served before the entrees, and we're always surprised with how fresh and large they area. Entrees are always delicious; I seem to order one of the daily specials and my husband always goes for the linguini and clam sauce, which he likes so much here he won't order it any place else. Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here for my grandfathers birthday on a slow night. We had a table set for 12, we later told the hostess if we can clear the table and sit 8 people instead. They said right away. Yeah not ! After being there awhile we finally we had somebody get our drinks. However they never came back around to fill our drinks. Nothing. I was a near a table that a pitcher of ice tea. I filled my own cup several times till the pitcher was empty. We asked a gentlemen if we could get out waiter for service and it was constantly somebody different. We order some app, and bread. However we had to ask 5 times for bread after waiting 30 minutes. So there was dirty plates pilling up and what not. They still haven't  cleared the table. So I get up and I move it myself. In this time I'm observing other table and they are waited on, they eat leave and new customers come. Now while this time, I don't even have a server to order to. I wait. Finally, I walk out. The customer service sucked. I'm glad I didn't spend my money at this place."}
{"text":"Great great great customer service! They remembered us from our first visit. Yummy food!! Lobster bisque is sooooooooo good :-)"}
{"text":"Cool environment once again read a bad review had to try it out not let down bed reviews is where you find the best food .. because the ppl who take time out of Thais day to trash a A restaurant are the same people  that don't let there kids have sugar  ... shitty shitty people"}
{"text":"Spur of the moment dinner out so we didn't have a reservation. The host couldn't have been more gracious about it. It was early but still some places aren't happy when you just show up. Our service was impeccable as always. Our server, Olivia, was friendly and took great care of us. We started off with the Escargot, which was the most tender we've ever had.  I indulged and had the Pasta Carbonara served table side by Chef Romolo. To say this was rich and delicious would be an understatement! Husband has Fettucine D'Amico and it was also outstanding. The sauce and Italian sausage (made in house) was perfectly seasoned. And the portions were more than generous. I wish I had room for a dessert! Next time."}
{"text":"2.5 stars, maybe.  I hate to bag on a restaurant because I know restaurant owners work so hard, but this was a pretty bad experience.  I know they have live music, too, and that is a sign of class.  Fundamentally, the problem with this place can best be summed up by saying that it wouldn't surprise me if there isn't a single Italian involved in the running of this place.  If there is, they have gone so American it's hard to tell.  Think Pascal in \"Big NIght.\"  When I showed up by myself at 7pm, I had not eaten lunch so I should have been pretty easy to please.  The restaurant was mostly empty, yet I was sat  at a small table right next to the only baby in the restaurant.  Really?  I probably didn't look Awhatukee chic, but I didn't look like a bum either.  And hey, it was Monday and my credit card is paid off.  I was sat by the owner (I think).  He didn't take a drink order and then I waited a long time to get a menu or a drink.  I don't blame the server.  It was bad timing as she knew she had a meal for four being plated and a couple of credit cards to run.  The owner could have easily handled both the menu and my drink order.  Then, they brought the garlic bread.  It was that soggy over-buttered, undercooked, nastiness you would never get in Italy or even a high-end Italian restaurant in the states.  (Think Fazoli's)  The greasiness probably started to take away my appetite which had been sky high when I arrived.  I would strongly recommend that Ruffino's ditch the garlic bread and go with nice Italian bread and small bowl of butter.  Soon after, the entrees for the neighboring table arrived.  They didn't look like $25-30 entrees.  Even the osso bucco looked unappetizing..  Then, they brought me a cup of brodo with tortellini.  The waitress warned me to be careful because it was super hot.  I would say it was just hot enough not to get sent back.  It was decent, but kind of puny for four bucks.  The bowl would have been seven and I was mostly trying it out of curiosity.  The broth was pretty good, but as it got colder it lost any magic it had.  I also got a Campari and soda, which was a little light on Campari.  It didn't come with a fruit wedge of any type, which is pretty standard when an Italian is behind the bar.  So, I asked for an orange.  Unfortunately, because I was seated in the farthest corner from the door and the bar, I didn't get the orange until I was over halfway through the Campari and soda.  Maybe I'm off base here and I should asked for it explicitly.  Sorry, I'm not much of a drinker.  The salad was quite good.  They make it tableside which is nice because I got to pick my choice of elements.  The greens were excellent and the dressing was nice.  I think I got two portions even though I was by myself, which was great.  Unfortunately, there was a little too much cheese (or something) making it too heavy.  Still, not bad.  Throughout the evening my water glass was empty, which is annoying when you're paying $20 minimum for an entree.  I'm not a stickler about this stuff, but when it happens 3-5 times at a place like this, it's not right.  My waitress was very nice and worked very hard.  One thing that sort of stuck with me was when I was discussing the menu, she said something like, \"They've been here 20 years, it's good.\"  I'm wondering if that was indicative of a place resting too much on its laurels.  I got the Fettuccini Ruffino which was a sausage-based dish listed as one of seven signature dishes on the menu and strongly recommended by my server because it was \"simple\" and tasty.  After a pretty dubious performance so far, I convinced myself that this entree was going to hit it out of the park and save the evening.  Instead, it was a total failure and I was actually forcing it down by the end.  It wasn't simple.  It was sloppy.  They cooked the life out of the fettuccini and the sauce looked like something Olive Garden would have invented, not like the sausage crumbles with oil, pasta and vegetables I am used to at high-end Italian joints.  The sausage was exactly like something you'd buy at Trader Joe's, which isn't bad, but it didn't seem homemade or special.  Honestly, if they had put the plate in front of me, my first reaction would have been to tell them they had brought it to the wrong table.   Maybe I was expecting the wrong the thing, but whatever the case, it didn't taste very good.  Afterward, I went to Enzo's Cafe and Gelato for a cappuccino to make things right.  There was more Italian in that cappuccino than a whole meal at Ruffino's.  Now, I'm watching Tony Bourdain in Naples just to make up for the rest of the evening..  I hope I can get another chance to go here and have them prove me wrong, but I won't do it on my dime.  There was just a little too much Olive Garden in Ruffino's to justify the prices."}
{"text":"my husband and I ate here a few months back and really enjoyed the food. The service was excellent. I found all of the staff to be quiet friendly.  It is very expensive. For two people you will spend about $70, depending on what you get. My husband and I had two meals and a glass of wine each.  I think as far as Italian food goes this is the best I have had so far in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We have been going to Ruffino's for years! Love the intimate setting and decor.  The  live music from the bar drifts into the dining room making it a wonderful setting. It's not too loud - just the right amount of music to enjoy and a fabulous meal each and every visit!  The food is outstanding!  The meat lasagne and stuffed mushrooms make us come back from more. Thank you Ruffino's for always providing the best Italian food and service!"}
{"text":"Looking forward to going to Trattoria D'Amico over and over again. Wonderful authentic Italian cuisine. The service is terrific. So glad to have them here in Ahwatukee.  Wonderful Italian seafood options."}
{"text":"AMAZING food.   Wonderful staff.  Have had the Lasagna, Duck Ravioli, Lobster Bisque, and Carrot Cake. Can't say enough good things about this place.  Family owned and they are super nice and know how to make you feel at home."}
{"text":"This place has a gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan menu (ask for it)!!  Had the vegan pasta premavera.  Good food, drink, and great service.  Enjoyed the music!!"}
{"text":"Ruffino was the first restaurant my family ate at when we moved to Arizona, which means that simple math would suggest I've been eating here for sixteen years! Seriously. I've eaten here several times a year for sixteen years and have been through either two or three owner changes. I love it. From the mildly cheesy, somewhat 80s styling to the tuxedo'd out waiters, I can't get enough. Ruffinos is a classy restaurant where you're more than some random customer and through my years here, the management has practically bent backwards at times to make things right.  The food here is incredible, and if you're lucky enough to come on a night they have osso bucco, you'll be stuck coming back for the next sixteen years like me. I can vouch for so many of the food items here, but I'll just make a couple of suggestions. For starters the clams casino and escargot can't be beat, they are both rich and garlicky and the escargot is simply not as chewy as most places, so good. For your meal try the tortellini ruffino, one of my favorite meals of all time, or the veal ruffino or filet medallions if they have them. But the osso bucco is a step above most things I've tried in my life. Expensive and worth it.  Look, I don't waste my time on bad restaurants, I eat at good places and me continuing my business here for so long means they're doing something very well, try out Ruffino and see what it is."}
{"text":"Server was very non chalant from the get go. Not saying bad but attitude didn't sit well with me, kind of felt like I was lucky he was waiting on me, rather than him appreciating us as guest. Never even asked if this was our first visit or not.  Did the scallop wrapped bacon w/ raspberry chipotle sauce - to bad they use pre cooked bacon to wrap the scallops the bacon was cold. Garnished with lettuce tomatoes and cucumber ( over kill) Bread was really tasteless.  Salad was wilted - tasted good  Food was fair not a WOW! Okay totally a disappointment dessert TIRAMISU -- the worse that I've ever tasted!!!! Big question: Would I revisit: NO - only as part of a group would I not on my own.  Then why three stars - to be fair comparatively to other restaurants that's what they deserve. I can only say try them you might enjoy their food."}
{"text":"Favorite Italian restaurant in Phoenix.  Small, intimate and quaint.  The owner takes pride in the food and the service.  Both bar and restaurant have an amazing atmosphere.  Lobster ravioli and fettuccini are delicious!  Love it!!"}
{"text":"I love this spot. The exterior is a bit misleading but the family friendly atmosphere inside and the authentic and delicious food inside make up for that. I brought my very Italian in-laws to dinner here and everyone had amazing things to say about the food. The oysters Rockefeller were a hit, and I think we ended up trying 8 or 9 different entrees and were thrilled with them all. Save room for the cannoli!!!"}
{"text":"My wife, a friend of ours and myself experienced an amazing meal. My wife had the Ravioli di Mare, our friend had the Linguine Carbonara and I had the Pasta al Forno. All homemade pastas were cooked to perfection and the taste was out of this world. The portions were extremely generous and we're looking forward to the leftovers. We sat in the lounge area and Michael the bartender/waiter was the best. He knew his menu and shared his recommendations with us. He makes a pretty good margarita as well!"}
{"text":"Unexciting, bland and expensive!  Service was good, if somewhat snobbish.  Food was nothing special run of the mill bland Italian fair.  All in all its probably not worth it. Especially for someone like myself who is really not Italian fan.   \"I no like\"  Eugene"}
{"text":"Met a friend for happy hour.  Didn't enjoy the $5 Mark West Pinot Noir, but really liked the housemade limoncello!  Romolo, a co-owner of Trattoria D'Amico, had me sample it, and after a couple of sips, I knew I'd order one for me and guessed correctly that my friend would want one, too.  Alessio, Romolo's brother-in-law, was friendly and patient as I asked a few questions regarding the bread and pastas- are they made in-house?  The bread is from a local bakery, and some of the pastas are homemade- gnocchi, ravioli, cannelloni, and lasagna.  I already placed an order of Bocconcini di filetto prior to friend's arrival, and this was delivered shortly before friend arrived.  I almost returned it after seeing how charred the pieces were, but the description did mention it being \"blackened Cajun-style.\"  Now, I've seen two different presentations of \"blackened-\" one is burnt/charred, and the other is seasoned with so many spices that the entree takes on a darkened appearance.  Since Alessio had been so nice and open to all of my questions, I decided I'd give the charred pieces a try, and are we glad I did!  \"First bite is the best,\" an adage that certainly applied to the first piece I tried, but also the last piece.  The two pieces in between were a bit sinewy and less flavorful.  However, I wouldn't mind ordering this again.    It was hard to leave TD for an appointment nearby, due to Alessio's and Romolo's attentiveness and the friendly demeanor of other guests- most seemed to be regulars- but we had to leave, but not before agreeing to come back for dinner!  Appointment over, we found ourselves back at TD and sat at one of the dining rooms.  If you can, do try to get seated at the back, behind the wall of wine bottles.  Atmosphere is quieter here and very intimate.  I knew I wanted to try the Linguine Carbonara (pancetta, garlic, olive oil) from looking at the photos posted on TD's Yelp page.  I also thought the Ravioli D'anatra (stuffed with braised duck and ricotta, with sun-dried tomatoes, and tomato-cognac butter sauce) sounded exquisite, but Alessio preferred the Orecchiette Alla Boscaiola (Italian sausage, broccoli, minus mushrooms, white wine sauce), which also sounded divine.  I chose the linguine and friend ordered the ravioli, which made me happy because I wanted to try a housemade pasta dish!    Entrees come with your choice of a side salad, or a cup of pasta e fagioli.  Oh, how I miss ordering this type of soup!  I've enjoyed them immensely before I'd developed allergies to carrot and celery, so soups are pretty much off-limits to me now, but I didn't have to wallow in self-pity very long, because the salad was full of fresh greens, amazingly plump and sweet tomato slices (bomb!), with a terrific Italian vinaigrette.  Darn!  I meant to ask if I could purchase a bottle of it to take home... One more reason to return.  The linguine carbonara was the first to arrive, cooked table-side in a cheese wheel put to flame!  Romolo himself did the cooking, and it was a sight to behold.  I'd asked how many times is a cheese wheel used, and he said that he'd opened this particular wheel two weeks ago, and wheels can be used one to two months until it splits apart.  What a disappointment then to discover this gorgeous dish- you can imagine our mouths salivating as we watched it being prepared- was too salty!  I knew it was too salty for me to enjoy at first bite, but I thought I'd give it another try after tasting the ravioli.  Oh, the ravioli was perfectly salted, the pasta was impeccably al dente and homemade (!), and the tomato-cognac butter sauce was delightful!  When I went back to the linguine, it was even saltier than the first try, so I gave up.  Friend tried a second forkful and agreed it was very salty, but that it's most likely from it being cooked in the cheese wheel.  I was going to try my fourth small forkful when server Luigi came by and asked how everything was.  \"The entree was so salty,\" I just had to say something, and after expressing surprise, Luigi quickly offered to take the dish away and give me a chance to choose another entree, and the orecchiette it was.  Luigi (Luis is his real name) showed his great sense of humor by confirming my special request of \"no mushrooms\" with \"OK, extra mushrooms!  I repeated with a \"no, no mushrooms,\" to which he laughed and said he understood, because he didn't like mushrooms himself.  Oh, but I do love them, just can't have them anymore.  He would later return to say the chef would like to know if I wanted shiitake or button mushrooms...  Too funny.  Very pretty entree- plump ear-shaped pasta, nice chunks of crushed Italian sausage, with a whole one just in case you needed more of the spicy meat, and luscious, verdant broccoli.    We were too full to try the housemade tiramisu and cannoli, so that will be another reason to return, and soon!  I could easily see myself taking friends and family here for holiday meals and happy hour get-togethers."}
{"text":"Been here several times.  Food is generally good, happy hour prices could be good if they know how to ring you up.  Depending on who waits on you, you will be charged for drinks you didn't order and the prices will be inconsistent on the check for what you actually order.  3 different prices for the same brand of beer.  I believe this is padding to compensate for the fledgling revenues and dwindling crowd.  Sit at the bar as the service is better.  Careful when you bring up the inconsistencies on the tab as the owner is defensive and condescending.  They should practice consistency.  Long time regulars complain about the shell of this establishment from whatnot was, but come here for convenience.  If you really have a choice, go to Garage across the street.  Good service and act like they appreciate your business."}
{"text":"Come to this wonderful restaurant! Ask for Theresa to make you a Manhattan at the bar and Karis to wait on your party. Quite honestly the food was phenomenal and the service was top notch! Finish the meal with a shot of Limoncello to end the meal perfectly"}
{"text":"This is the most amazing food in ahwatukee! We are so lucky to have this authentic food in our neighborhood. My family ordered delivery service which was prompt, delicious and such a nice alternative to Chipotle  Try their cannoli and lasagne and you will see they know what they are doing. This place is a real treasure! I accidentally found them this week, so I don't know what it was like before, but the new owners are from Rome and you can taste it!"}
{"text":"Good food and amazing service, but will not be back.  Four of us have visited the restaurant religiously in March during Angel's Spring Training for more than 11 years. The prior owner (when it was called Ruffino for many years) served the best garlic bread on the planet.  It was  thin, with a soft middle, crunchy crust and slightly blackened edges.  They use fresh small chunks of garlic and  dipped each slice in butter.   Inexplicably, the new owner did away with it, and instead, serves a very plain white loaf.   This is one of those rare instances where you seek out a restaurant because of one particular dish.  In this case, it was the bread.   No joke....I tipped the busboy last year $10 to keep our basket full of the bread during the entire meal.     Everything else is good, but not exceptional.  We are begging you.....bring back the bread !!"}
{"text":"Really good quality Italian food! This restaurant reminded me of the Italian spots I grew up going to in New York/Connecticut. The seafood was super tasty and the pasta was perfect. Yum!"}
{"text":"Very nice! Great service and our meals were excellent!  Would definitely go back again.  Each time we've eaten there it has been a special treat."}
{"text":"Fabulous meal.  Amazing menu and options, great drinks and great service with a great band playing on a Saturday night!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Trattoria D'Amico. The food is authentic and delicious! Service was attentive and friendly! Try the lasagna and table side prepared fettuccine Carbonara."}
{"text":"This place is LEGIT - authentic Italian food!  WE went last Friday because Rebecca and Jorge were playing and we were so happy with the new ownership.  Everything about this meal was superb!  We started with a tasty assortment of fresh prosciutto, soppressata, coppa, olives, artichokes and cheese. Free warm bread too. Next was the soup - Pasta E Fagioli, it was good and will be even better when we get cooler weather.  The pasta was fresh, daughter had the cannelloni filled with meat and spinach, I enjoyed a simple pasta with fresh tomatoes, roasted garlic pecorino cheese and the portion was typical Italian mama style - HUGE!  Wine list was changed too and the HH was awesome with a $4 glass of Prosecco! Will be back for another authentic Italian dinner."}
{"text":"What a great date night! We arrived at 8 with no reservation even though they were busy they were able to find us a table. That is when our culinary adventure began. Giovanni showed up at our table to introduce himself and conduct our adventure with some humor.  We started with the Tableside preparation of the linguine carbonara. We  split the duck ravioli that had an amazing cognac cream marinara sauce.  This is now our new favorite Italian restaurant that we expect to frequent often."}
{"text":"Excellent meal and the service was top notch.  Prices are reasonable and all entrees include salad or soup."}
{"text":"I have heard so many good things about this place, I may have came in with too high of expectations. Not sure if the change in ownership has impacted the quality of food(??), but I was underwhelmed. Had the chicken Marsala which was a bit on the sweet side. Not a bad meal by any means, but unsure if I'll make the trip to Tukee for this place again. Piano player and service were a high point."}
{"text":"I haven't had great Italian in way too long. Thank you to the boss man for suggesting this place for our office dinner outing.   Everything was great with Ruffino's, right from the start, from making easy reservations on their web page, to the call back confirming our reservation, to seating us right on time.  We started in the bar area for a drink before we sat down, the cocktail server was very nice and got our drinks quickly, you know we needed them after meetings all day. From then on all was great; Our server, John I think, was very nice and made great suggestions, the manager was around a few times to make sure everything went well.   Some of the guys at the table wanted to order a few appetizers, muscles and escargot. Oh dear lord they are going to make me eat snails I thought to myself. And to my great surprise, they were great. I have never had them before, and from my understanding, they are only good if made right, and made right these were. Very yummy, i will have them again for sure.   For dinner I had the Shrimp Carbenara, suggested by John, and it was awesome! Very tasty, huge portion, and a great leftover meal for the next day.   Ruffino's has been around for a long time from my understanding, and I can clearly see why, great service, great food, great time!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I dined here on a Friday evening for the first time. We loved it! We had reservations for 5:30pm (earlier than usual due to having an event to attend afterwards) and the restaurant was practically empty at that time, and gave us a quiet, pleasant dining experience. The restaurant did however fill up by the time we left around 7pm, so I would recommend making a reservation. We started with the escargot, which was delicious, although the mushrooms were a bit overpowering and almost masked the flavor of the actual escargot. We also shared a half dozen raw oysters. For entrees I had the seafood stuffed ravioli in lobster bisque sauce which was to die for. I've never had anything quite like it before and I will be coming back for it again. My fiance had the Capellini alla pescatora (seafood in a marinara sauce). While he enjoyed the large portion of seafood, there was entirely too much pasta that came with it. Not necessarily a bad thing if you have a large appetite, just too much for him to finish.  Our server was friendly and polite, although near the end of the meal she did seem to disappear for a period of time after our entrees came out and unfortunately this left us no time for dessert. On our way out, we also noticed a larger crowd in the bar area with a live pianist, a nice added touch for ambiance. We will definitely be back again as there were many menu options we would still like to try as well as a very nice wine list."}
{"text":"Always excellent! Each year they host my small party of 40 with perfection! Food is delicious and service impeccable! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food was Good, service was slow and the music was a snooze fest, definitely not like the last time we were there.T he drinks fluctuating between week and to strong to drink."}
{"text":"I love Ruffinos Italian Resturant    Food great!!  Tableside Salad service!!  awesome!!  Love the new remodel!!  No longer the 80 Soprano's look.  Its fresh, its light its younger looking!!   I will be back for Valentines Day!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic entrees, but....in order to get 5 stars need to improve Cesar Salad, which was drowned in dressing, and dessert, which was a small slice of stale carrot cake. However, the service, imaginative cocktails, and entrees were fantastic. Almost the best we've ever had outside Italy. They make the carbonara right at your table. The menu is extensive but not overwhelming and not a lot of seafood choices. Not inexpensive, so they need to make it perfect. But definitely a 'go back to' place."}
{"text":"My mom went to Ruffino's and thought it was really good so we decided to give this place a shot. When you first walk in there a small bar that looks a little cramped but the dining room is pretty big. Nothing really stood out with the decor.   Anyways, we started off with fried calamari and it was a huge appetizer. The batter on the calamari was very light and cooked just right. I thought it was really good. Also, they gave us little pieces of garlic bread. Outstanding. Really good. Everyone gobbled it up so we had to get another basket.   So each meal comes with soup or salad. I got the salad and I thought it was really big dinner salad it had mixed greens with cucumber, mushrooms, and tomatoes. The salad dressing was great. Not overpowering because at some places the vinegar is a little too much. Not here. Really good.   I had the Seafood Ruffino. It had shrimp, scallops, muscles, and clams over a bed to pasta with a red sauce. I thought it was pretty good. I thought the red sauce could have tasted a little better. It had a good taste but not great. My wife had the chicken primavera. Chicken was moist and she enjoyed it. Hugh dish.   To end our meal was tried the chocolate cake and cheese cake. I thought they were good. Not great. I'm used to these Italian restaurant having great deserts.    The service was top notch. Server took care of us and he was always checking on us during each portion of our meal (appetizer, salad, entree, and desert). Our glasses were filled on a regular basis. The only thing is the server did his job very good but didn't feel like he had personality. Very business like. Seemed like all the servers were like that.   So really good service, good food, and huge portions. Not a bad place. We'll see if we can make it back to this place."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a luscious combination of Chicken Marsala and Manicotti!  It was perfectly prepared.  We also love their garlic bread and wonderful house salad.  We  ordered the fried mozzarella as an appetizer.and it is delicious- not the traditional pre-breaded sticks.  It is a large,thick square of mozzerella, deep fried and topped with marinara. The service is excellent -very attentive.  There was also live music playing softly in the background.  It was a  perfect evening!"}
{"text":"We come here all the time for the mellow mood, great food and drinks and the the staff. This place has been a staple in Ahwatukee for 25+ years for a reason. Dress well for the dining room, dress down for the bar."}
{"text":"Amateur Hour: How Dinner Could Have Gone Terribly Wrong But Somehow Ended Up Being Rock Solid  The setting: New Year's Eve, six o'clock, South Tempe and Ahwatukee The players: The ravenous Mr. Man and Me, a Black Mitsubishi Montero on a mission  Granted, going out for dinner on New Year's Eve is by and large a mistake. Holidays are the times when it's most likely the stresses placed on the kitchen and wait staff may result in frazzled service and a less than savory dining experience. But ramen for dinner was out of the question. (I've tried to keep that survival food to a minimum since graduating.) So what's a gal to do?   Hop into the hooptyville and cruise in search of something better than soggy shoestrings. Doesn't sound like much of a challenge at first until our two players realize that it's New Year's Even and they're pretty fucked for A) Places that still have seats open cuz all the smart folks made reservations, B) Places that are open at all cuz nobody wants to work when there's bubbly to be had and C) Places other than 24 hour greasy spoons cuz even fast food joints close on New Year's Eve.  45 minutes elapse in which our players dart in and out of establishments encountering option A, drive by potential restaurants while encountering option B, and almost succumb to option C. Enter Ruffino's, a humble little Italian Restaurant located in a strip mall dangerously close to the suburbs of Ahwatukee.   So we saunter up and politely wait our turn for the hostess to be free. \"Two. No, we didn't make reservations.\" And the flibbertigibbet proceeds to seat two parties milling around us without even informing us whether dining there was a possibility. Again, she turns to us. \"Do you have an open table for two? No, we didn't make reservations.\" Again, she proceeds to seat others. Lots and lots of others.  Oh no you did not just rouse the bitch from her slumber. The pursed lips, raised eyebrow and death stare begin to surface. Mr. Man senses the subtle change, \"Do you just want to go and find somewhere else to eat?\"  A cold, calculating response with an edge sharp enough to cut the horrid poodle hair off the twit that's been snubbing us spews out. (I can't recall what it was exactly. The vitriol clouds memory, often with good reason.)  Then our savior, a tux dressed waiter out of stage left, greets us with a smile and ushers us to a table for two in the bar area. The bitch circles three times before settling down for a snooze so Erica can enjoy a nice meal with Mr. Man.  Since it was a busy holiday they only had three seating times and a truncated menu, but that just makes it easier for an indecisive gal like me to make up my mind. Mr. Man goes with his favorite, the Veal Marsala. I opt for the Veal Ruffino, prosciutto and mushrooms sauteed in a tarragon brandy cream sauce layered over veal medallions. Yes I eat poor caged baby cows. And I do it because they taste goooooood. My meal was perfection, with a side of al dente rigatoni in marinara and perfectly steamed petite julienne vegetables. The marsala wasn't as stellar, but I'm not the one that had to consume it, so to each their own.   The meal came with garlic bread, which was respectable, and a salad that was delish! Their house vinagrette was rockin'. We also decided to kick off the evening with a bottle of chardonnay that was chilled in one of them thingys that stands by your table.   There were balloons and streamers and live entertainment in the form of a super stellar, pitch perfect showman all tuxed out and belting out classics while playing the piano. Cutesy couples were even requesting songs and dancing with their sweeties. Aww. The sap in me just melts. See that puddle of goo at your feet? That's me. Don't step in it.  There was also a nice program they were running that night where they would take you home for a flat rate of 10 bucks within a 15 mile radius so you didn't ring in the New Year with a DUI. Now that's class.  I don't know if I'd ever go back here again (leetle on the pricey side at 20-30 bucks for an entree) but if you're in the area and looking for a dining experience rather than straight calories, hit it up!"}
{"text":"Place was great, service was good, Michelle took care of us, also the food was good too!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and it is inspiring to know the chef has been here for over 27 years since 1988.  Bravo! The staff was very welcoming and friendly!"}
{"text":"Update 4/14:. My wife and I have eaten at Damico's since it opened, even before when it was Ruffino's. It was always our \"go to\" place for special occasions.  Our neighborhood group has eaten there more times than I can count.  However, on April 14th, we called to order carryout.  I wanted chicken parmigiana, but the person taking the order told me\"it's not on the menu anymore\". I explained that they have always made it for me, and he replied very tensely, \" I told you we're not making it anymore because it's not made in the kitchen\".  I'm not sure what that means, but if he had said they were too busy for special orders, can we make you something else, or whatever, fine.  We won't be back, and neither will our dining group.  I wish them luck, but we're done."}
{"text":"Why did it take 40 minutes after my salad last night and still no entree!! Told the bartender I'm outta here. Man I want to like this place but my last two visits have been ruined by waiting and waiting for service. You get one more chance from me D'Amico - I just hope it's not strike three and you're out!"}
{"text":"After some juicy stuffed mushrooms and a delicious Caesar salad, the veal saltimbocca was absolutely divine. Great flavors and texture, fantastic service from Pache, and nostalgic atmosphere make Ruffino's an instant favorite."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant I have been to in Phoenix! Seriously... I'm not a pasta person, but their homemade pasta was outstanding. Classy, small Italian ma and pop ambiance. Causual or dressy will work here. Good happy hour specials. The bruschetta was very good. I had the pollo marsala, it came with cook squashes. The marsala sauce was very good. My girl had the linguine with pesto. I had some of it and was floored on how good it was. The pasta was fresh and tasty. I could have had a plate of it with just butter and garlic. I am going back.... Probably at least once a month. :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Ruffino's since they opened, about 3 owners ago.  First of all expect to enter a time machine and go back to the old-style restaurant's where the tables are covered with linen and the staff are constantly moving through the room.  I took a date there this spring, telling her that the outside isn't much to look at (in a strip mall between a shoe repair and a veterinarin), but when you open the door you find the place packed.  I had called ahead for a reservation, and was led immediately to the table.    As I wrote above, the service is excellent and the food great (a little pricy, but if you want value go to Olive Garden).  I was telling my date about the Osso Bucco being my choice if I ever had to pick a last meal, when the server took the hint and brought us a small plate of pasta with the sauce.  You're not going to get that at O-G.  So when you want a great meal at a local hole in the wall, I highly recommend Ruffino's.  On Friday's, weekends and holiday's you should call ahead for a reservation.  Keep the kids at home so you can really enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"Ruffino is definitely the kind of italian restaurant that your grandparents go to when they want to try somewhere nice. The decor is definitely mid-1980s but is well-kept.   I ate here for a work function, so I ordered from a limited menu. The only vegetarian option was a fettuccine alfredo, so I asked them if they could give me fettuccine with a marinara sauce. They gladly obliged  The marinara sauce was surprisingly good. Lots of chunky tomato bits and very good garlic flavor.  The fettuccine noodles were delicious....perfect thickness and just enough taste to make them compliment the sauce.  Service is friendly but forgetful; drinks were ordered by several people at the table at different times and were forgotten by the waiter.  Would I go here again? Honestly, with so many good italian options available, I wouldn't drive down to Ahwatukee to eat here, but if someone invites you out here, you will get a decent meal."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food in Phoenix. The Cannelloni was outstanding as was the pasta fagioli soup  and gnocchi. All fresh and made to order. Great service as well and the kids (11 & 13) loved the food as well."}
{"text":"Found on yelp.  Great soup, salad was good, and the lasagna was very good. My wife liked the veal piccata.   Service by Israel was excellent.  Good job!"}
{"text":"A fabulous neighborhood restaurant with authentic cuisine.  Everything I've had here has been delish and the owners are friendly and welcoming.  Excellent/comfortable bar with a great happy hour menu and martini nights (Sundays) are a fun way to try different concoctions.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed it this evening!  There was a bright attitude, a  contagious  passion from our waiter (Michael) that enticed us to taste his recommendations.  I had the seafood ravioli, Ron had the baked pasta with Bolognese sauce, and our BFF had their staples dish , the carbonara pancetta linguine. All their pasta dishes are homemade and perfectly executed.   We highly recommend this friendly Italian kitchen!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Duck ravioli was excellent. The service wasn't so good.  Server with an attitude."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this restaurant driving from Tucson to Phoenix airport.   It was FABULOUS!  Just a few blocks off I-10.   NOTE: IT IS 4902 WARNER RD - NOT East Warner Rd. This will be a frequent eating stop whenever we are in town! The Ravioli del Mar was incredible.   Served in a lobster bisque sauce.  I'll be back to sample the other plates! BTW, super friendly, old style Italian family restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my beautiful date.  I must say it was perfect.  Service is amazing.  Food was very very good, and the mood was just right.  Piano playing in the bar really set the mood.  The overall experience was top notch.  Everyone there cares about what they do."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!! Superb service!!!  So we went here for dinner last night. My wife picked this place since she's seen good reviews, and we were mostly  curious on their pasta made on a cheese wheel!  The place was cozy. It's in a strip mall, unassuming, but pleasant. When we got in, somebody was at the door, greeted us, really friendly guy. Only into the meal did we realize he was the owner of the place. The host was polite, had our table ready in a couple of minutes - we did the online reservation, party of 5 with 2 kids. It was quick. It's start of dinnertime, so place was starting to get busy. But it never seemed like it at all thru dinner, since our waiter was always checking on us, water and drinks were always refilled even before it's half empty. Bread was warm and refilled, we said we're good on 3rd refill. We asked the waiter for a good wine pairing with our pasta, he came back with the owner's recommendation and it was excellent.  Onto the main event, we had the calamari, escargot, and the star of the show, the linguine cheese wheel (I forgot the official name). Calamari was light, crunchy, salted and seasoned just right, and it was fresh - no fishy aftertaste at all (not like other restaurants). Escargo was delicious. And for the pasta, the chef (who is actually THE owner too) prepares it right on your table. We never had pasta made on a cheese wheel, and let me tell you, you won't have it any other way (of course not your everyday price point too, but it was worth it)! The sauce had really tasty tasty strips of pork and the pasta is perfect, homemade and just perfect! Big size serving! My son ordered a side o sausage, and he finished it with his pasta.  To cap off, we ordered cappucino, and we also got a limoncello as part of the meal (goes with the meal) - excellent topoff! The chef/owner really makes the place his own with his and staff's charm.   Our dinner was excellent all around! Perfect service! A mom and pop shop that you can go to for a great meal, on a date, or with the family - just excellent experience all around!  Will definitely be back for more! Thanks again guys for the great meal and service!!!"}
{"text":"We were all raving about this place!   Linguini and clams were beyond delicious. My friends had ravioli and some pasta with sausage and were licking their plates, too.   Solid wine list.   Love the veteran server and entertaining chef. The decor is a little 80s-esque, but I'm an 80s girl, so bring it.   Live music on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Amazing! Delicious! It was our first time here and we were very impressed! We came here for our anniversary & had an amazing dinner!    Everything we had was delicious and the staff was exceptional! Will definitely be back! Don't be fooled by the outside or the location- the inside is superb!"}
{"text":"We love coming here because they know how to treat their customers from the unique house wines to expansive wine menu. ... happy hour...and rustic foods with elegant flairs"}
{"text":"Ruffino's is truly one of the valley's best italian restaurants. Food is delicious, on the expensive side but worth it. I tried all the food at the table and each dish was well plated, appropriate portions and, again, tasted great. The outside was a little deceiving, it looked rough, but the inside is beautiful. Staff was friendly and stayed on top of the service. We will be going here again!"}
{"text":"Really good authentic food, kinda expensive only because I like to get a pasta that they only have for lunch that's technically a dinner portion. Always enough for leftovers & the house salad dressing is really good as well."}
{"text":"As mentioned below, this is a great hidden spot. It does not look like much on the outside but it has great food, quick service and Italian all the way.  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Right away - I must tell you that we visited on Valentine's Day and that may make a difference to many readers. The place was packed though our table was ready as per our reservation. We were here to celebrate a major milestone birthday and I had requested notice of such. It never happened, even after I reminded the wait staff. We were surrounded by couples celebrating an evening of Love and the music from the bar worked nicely to set the mood. Service was inattentive, and I felt that not being a regular actually hurt our chances of having a decent meal. Our waiter knew just about everyone else around us and extra helpings of bread and the like went out to them. The food was meh. Decent Italian, but I think I could do the same plates justice at home. Again, I realize it was a special night with a special menu, but warmed over pasta just wasn't that special. I've heard good things about Ruffino's over the years but probably won't dare a second visit."}
{"text":"I've been coming to ruffinos for 10 years - amazing service - amazing food - linguini and white calm sauce and the sausage dish Porto Fino ruffinos I believe are best you've ever had - excellent choice for a quiet romantic dinner"}
