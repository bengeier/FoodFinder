{"text":"Eaten at a dozen or so places in this city that claim to be Mexican. This is one of the best in Calgary. An array of salsas and sauces bring depth to this places authenticity. Asada Tacos with cilantro salsa = deliciousness. Consistantly cooked to perfection everytime I've eaten here. Housemade tortilla chips deliver the crunch you need and are made fresh daily. My vegetarian wife has rave reviews as well. They are more than willing to accommodate dietary needs. Good prices make it well worth the adventure to the market. Support this local family run business you wont be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"The take home offerings are awesome. The sauces are so delicious! They have lots of samples to try before you buy. The salsa verde is my favourite. The chips and salsa are great. On one side is the take home grocery and on the other side is the take-out. The take out food is very good. I am looking forward to making home-made tacos with the sauces and tortillas from here. This is authentic Mexican and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The CARNITAS  here ARE  better than Mexco, the meat is absolutely wonderful,  Mr.  Armando --THE MANAGER, IS FROM MEXICO CITY,   and has a secret with his pork, one word.    DELICIIOUS.  for the best food, coming here is a must."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican food I have had in North America outside of Mexico ever and I have had a lot of very good Mexican food in a lot of places. Try their asada and chorizo tacos are amazing. Real horchata and a wide array of Jarritos available. The variety of salsas (some super hot and yummy - I recommend the Chapo for the brave)  and moles is amazing and their chimichurri from the grocery across is delicious! It is in the Crossroads Market in Inglewood - open Friday, Sat, Sun. Go there!"}
