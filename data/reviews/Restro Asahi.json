{"text":"One of my good friends kept bragging about this AYCE sushi and how good it is. I was very disappointed. The customer service was okay but the choices are ridiculously low, not to say absent. The place looks very dirty and old. I will not be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped by with some friends late one night, food was passable for the price, the woman manager though was horrible in the extreme, would never go back."}
{"text":"Ok this place is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.  The sushi is not the best sushi you have ever had, it is probably not even second or third best.  In fact this sushi is probably some of the most mediocre sushi you will ever have.  I still enjoy it though and you know why?  Their all you can eat dinner menu is $11.99.  That's right, try getting a small tray of fast food sushi for less than $10 let alone AYCE sushi.

The server is friendly, but obviously there is usually only one working, so they are very swamped with customers and orders.  The sushi itself comes out a little slow in the later orders, but the first few batches come out rather quickly.  I did notice however the longer you eat there the more vinegar they put in the sushi rice.  Not sure if that is to stop the customers from eating too much, but it didn't bother me.

Overall a decent sushi place for the money, you can't get much for $11.99 these days!"}
{"text":"I've been a few times and I liked it the first time but I find it went downhill.  The last time I went the all you can eat menu had been really cut down in size and a lot of the choices just didn't taste very good.  We also got chicken skewers served to us half raw which was unacceptable.  Service wise it wasn't bad but you do have to be careful to keep track of what you order because they will forget to bring it sometimes."}
