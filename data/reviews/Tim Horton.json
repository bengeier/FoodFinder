{"text":"SUPER slow staff!!! They really take their time! In the mornings when time matters, and there are 3 long lines in the shop, they are moving so slowly, chatting to each other and don't even care. I don't understand how their manager is fine with this!!"}
{"text":"I need to know why a large coffe at Tim Horton's in Canada is $1.60... and over $2.00 in the states? I know it not breaking the bank.. but having an economics degree forces you to think about these things."}
{"text":"This is the best Tim Horton's I have ever been to!!! Usually I have to get my blood drawn and pick up donuts separately but this location makes it a breeze. You can also drink your coffee while you wait."}
{"text":"I ordered the breakfast combo (who would have thought there would be so  many questions? what kind of meat, what kind of bun, do I want hash browns or a donut)
Anyways, I finally ordered a sausage on a biscuit, and when it was brought to me (in a bag) the lady made sure it was the sausage, however, left me  standing there waiting for the hash brown she never told me was in the same bag.
Eventually it was sorted out, and I had my breakfast.
The food was just like every other Tim's.
The next problem was it was impossible to enjoy my breakfast,  as there was a constant line  at both cashiers, and one of  the lines always  snaked into my table.
I understand Tim's is busy, but maybe some seats should be taken out to accommodate the lines."}
{"text":"I'm not used to that Canadian smokey flavored coffee. I just don't enjoy it and liken that flavor to burnt. Dunkin Donuts cofee all the way. Also Small is a 6 Oz and that should never be worth $1.80.

However, the Tim Horton Donuts beat out Dunkin Donuts! OH NO! Traitor! The donuts are lighter and fluffier. I had a box of ten timbits for $1.8 (I know, tim bits sound perverted because I think Americans have minds always in the gutter.)

Glazed, plain and honey dipped were absolutely fabulous, but cherry tasted like they mixed cough syrup into a donut and chocolate tasted like that cardboard chocolate that Asia also seems to like. These must be regional tastes."}
{"text":"Terrible crappy franchise with crappy and very processed and unhealthy foods! This location is terrible! Always making mistake on your order would usually order a coffee. You couldn't pay me to eat there salty soups and processed sandwiches made with squirt meat. This franchise is owned by Burger King now so its really gone down hill. I recommend Mcdonald's or Starbucks over this junk! Half the time you get a person who can barely speak english. Real dummies working here. Avoid like the plague!"}
{"text":"As a tourist from out of the country. This fast food chain was very welcoming  My food was fresh and tasty. It's true that the team members are always smiling and makes it more inviting to sit down and enjoy your meal. No need to rush and get out compared to fast food chains like McDonalds."}
{"text":"Tim Hortons has been in the new lately for the crazy decline in quality of the food an service. This location takes the cake in that department. I've lived in Pincourt for 4 years now and I won't go into great detail but the joint constantly either burns the food or doesn't cook it enough. I've on several occasions received the wrong order too."}
{"text":"Terrible layout first of all. If you order anything other than a coffee and donut, you don't know where to pick up your order. It's made in behind where you can't see what's being done to your food. Ordered the breakfast combo number two. Hashbrown was tasteless and the bread was stale, hoping it hadn't expired. Ugh. Feel sick already. Staff was friendly though"}
