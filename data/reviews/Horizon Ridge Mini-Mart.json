{"text":"Nice local sandwich shop beats the pants off all the commercial chains in the area. Why? Simple. For $5.00 you get a sandwich worth $10.00 in quality Boar's Head meats. 

Just keep in mind this is a mini-mart so you might have a wait, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I've been a customer of yours since the day you opened.  On or about December 1 I stopped in  to purchase 4 of your famous $5.00 sub sandwiches. I had just purchased a $10 certificate off of Restaurant.com. The dumpy looking bum you had working says \"We don't take those anymore\". I said it's on Restaurant.com right now and they \"NEVER EXPIRE\". He just shrugged me off. I showed him a $5 coupon from GrubHub. He just shrugged me off again. Then I showed him a \"Sandwich Savings Club\" card with 8 spaces initialed and another card with 4 spaces initialed. I said take 2 off of this card and put them on that card. \"Oh no, I can't do that. The card has to be completely filled in\". I couldn't get it thru to this nutball it was the same thing. I came in once before and bought 4 sandwiches but didn't have the other card so they put them on this card. I thought we were in agreement and he made up a footlong for me. He wrapped it up and brought it over to the counter and said it would be $6.50+-. I said \"I just gave you the \"Sandwich Savings Club\" cards\".  \"Oh no, I can't do that. The card has to be completely filled in\".  After haggling with this dickhead I said \"SCREW-IT\", turned around and walked out never to return and I will be posting this on Restaurant.com as well as other places.  I predict this store will be closed in 30-60 days with dickheads like him running your business. A shame, the sandwiches were real good."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Anthony is a great guy and we continually go back week after week. They have great beer, liquor, wine, and definitely the best sandwiches. This mini mart is the spot to go to. I would recommend to check it out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are as fresh as they can be. All hand made and they use Boarshead meats.   If you are tired of fast food,  stop here and try something really good!"}
{"text":"Great Sandwichs! Good prices and lots of store to choose from. Friendly staff. Great coffee! Wonderful liquor selection."}
{"text":"Subs are the best here.  Footlongs for $5 and $6.  I had a roast beef with horseradish cheddar cheese it was mouth watering also has lots of craft beers IPAs cheap liquor as well."}
{"text":"First things first, don't go here if you're in a hurry. I came in on a Sunday,which they usually are not open on Sundays, and the owner was working by himself. Took him a while to make my sandwich but it was so worth it.

$5 for a foot long with boars head meat and cheese. Unreal. The produce was all super fresh too. And the bread was fresh. Forget every other sandwich place in town, this is the place to go. No questions asked.

Get the oil and vinegar on the side!"}
{"text":"I felt like I had to write a review after my experience at Mini Mart on Friday. I was immediately greeted at the door by Anthony, and it's the little things like that, that I appreciate. Anthony was so friendly and helpful and suggested I try a slice of the upside down pineapple cake (I think that's what it called) and can I just say, it's the best thing you can get for a buck. Visits to Mini Mart will now be a daily routine"}
{"text":"Huge delicious subs. Anthony is awesome so friendly will definitely continue going back!!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a snack, grab some beer or a Boars Head sub. Nice selection of liquor and beer. They also have some poker machines by the entrance. The subs are the best you can get, they aren't shy when it comes to loading them with meat and all the other toppings. Can't beat the price either. I would much rather stop here than a gas station. They remember you right when you walk in the door."}
{"text":"I went back today, and this time I watched this guy make my sandwich.

On my last visit to Horizon Ridge Mini-Mart, it made wonder how this business was making great sandwiches with Boarhead meats for such a low price ($5.00), or were they doing a bait and switch and using cheaper stuff..   Well, they prove me wrong, and I\"m glad they did.  

Today, I walked into Horizon Ridge Mini-Mart, and ordered three different types of sub sandwiches.  I hate saying this, but I made this guy work hard on it, and to my surprise, he was pulling all the meat and cheeses out of the front cooler, and cutting each of them as he created my sandwiches.  Yes, these are real Boar Head meats and cheese, and this business doesn't skimp on it,  Even the lettuces was shaved by the meat slicer; well it's faster than the knife.  

This business looks like a one man operation, and you better not believe you will walk in, and get your sandwich within a minute of ordering. If you're coming during lunch time, expect 5 minute wait for each sandwich. 

When you get yours, and take a bite into it; you might realize this is one of the best deals in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Love this place! Huge delicious boar's head sandwiches for 5$ and super friendly service.. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place so much  I can't get enough of its sandwiches so good I come here all the time yummmmmm"}
{"text":"I never thought I would find myself reviewing a mini mart, but with huge Boars head sandwiches, nice people, and a wine bar, how could this place NOT be amazing?! Walking in here literally took me back to New Jersey. From the family oriented environment, to the guys insisting I try their favorite wines, what a GEM. A hole in the wall gem, but aren't those the best finds?
From what I understand this place is family owned and operated, and they really aim to please. The sandwich I had from here was one of the best subs I have had in Vegas. These guys really load it up with meat and veggies. 
There is your random mini mart stuff like soda, water, alcohol, and snacks. But there is also gaming, a wine tasting from 6-10 on Friday evenings, and even random supplies similar to a smoke shop. I realized I was exploring for a good ten minutes. 
Now I know this place is 4 doors down from one of the most popular coffee shops in Henderson right now, but don't get it twisted, they offer a decent cup of caffeine as well. 
I ended taking home a bottle of Chianti that was delicious, as well as a bottle of saki. 
If you are searching for a random brand of alcohol, this may be the place you find it. 
I know one thing, I will take the drive to deep Henderson for one of these sandwiches again. And I will most likely do it on a Friday, so I can enjoy the wine as well! Don't pass this place up thinking it's just a mini mart, there is so much more past the front door!"}
{"text":"Wow what A Hidden hide away. The sandwiches are so fresh and amazing.  I will never go to subway again.  The boars head meat and cheese really makes a difference.  The bread comes fresh everyday and they offer a great variety of toppings and prices 5.00 4 a soft fresh foot long. Im down for that weekly, trust me give them a try they don't disappoint.  Its the cutest little corner store with a lot of interesting products to choose from, defiantly a great addition to are neighbor hood."}
{"text":"Best sub sandwich ever. The price of their cold cuts is better than the grocery store. I'll definitely be back and let everyone else know how great they are. They also have much better coffee prices than the coffee shop next door.  The only real problem I have is that they aren't always open during their posted hours. I've been there twice during the afternoon and they were closed. No sign on the door, just closed and locked up tight. So, call before you make the trip because you never know."}
{"text":"Best deli around for the best price in town. Stopped by randomly and the owner Anthony is an awesome guy. Great service and definitely will be back. They also have everything you need from dog food to organic coffee to liquor beer and smokes, this is a one stop shop and I haven't seen one like it around here. Ten starts for them"}
{"text":"Went in to buy a few things and was super impressed with their wine selection as well as their wine tasting area.  I did not expect such a classy interior.  And based on the other reviews, I will definitely be coming back for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Great service, great deli. Great prices on liquor. Only the best from this place. Give them a try. Even have a walk in humidor."}
{"text":"I was referred by other Yelpers and I must agree. Service is super friendly and the Boar's Head sandwiches are the best. Packed with meat, cheese and veggies for inexpensive price. Also they have a variety of mini mart type groceries (organic and not). I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Found this place through a discount site with a $5 for $10 deal.  

I was skeptical at first since I have never been here, but the picture on Yelp helped.  

Ordered a hot pastrami sandwich with peppers, mustard, pickles, and pepper jack cheese. It was average and wasn't toasted enough.  There were too much mustard as well. 

The second sandwich was the black peppered turkey.  It was delicious and will definitely order again.  

The meat tasted and smelled fresh and the subs are huge.  I would say you can feed 2 people on 1 sub because the amount of meat are massive.  

I will definitely come back and now I know how the subs are made I can ask for less of some stuff to have the perfect sandwich."}
{"text":"Do not go to this establishment. The food is not as good as reviewed and the service is awful. The people who work there are rude and inconsiderate."}
{"text":"Business is closed drove down from Boulder City and it is closed. Says building is available on front and no sign of the store"}
{"text":"Seen that they do delivery on grub hub, so I figured I'd check them out and order delivery since I'm stuck at work and hungry, I ordered at 11:58am with expected delivery from 1:03 pm to 1:13pm, I waited till 1:33pm to call in and see the status of my order, the phone just rang and rang with no answer, so I contacted grub hub who got a hold of them and they said it should have been delivered by now and that they can't get a hold of their delivery driver, and that they will remake my order and send it out asap, so I gave them the benefit of a doubt and I got a new expected delivery of 2:45pm to 2:55pm, well I'm writing you at 6:07pm and no word of my order, that's 6 hours, wow this is the worst service ever, if you can't deliver in the time frame just let me know so I can order some where else, you have my phone number on the order. You lost a customer before you had the chance to make one, don't even deserve the 1 star I'm giving you"}
{"text":"This place is Grreat! Wine selection is top drawer. Cigar humidor is full of wonderful buys. Groceries are just what you want. Ponzu sauce, sesame oil and mirin for example. Beer and snacks are way cool as is owner! I'll be back often."}
{"text":"Best sandwich. The pastrami was nice. Awesome prices on the booze. I think it's 24 hr on the weekend as well!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The guy behind the counter couldn't be nicer. Great beer selection. $5 footling subs made with boarshead meat? Great deal! Not sure if it's a promotion or consistent price, but I'm coming back to get a sandwich for sure!"}
