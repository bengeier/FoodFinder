{"text":"The food was sitting out old and stale. They finally brought out some fresh chicken and after biting it I had to spit it out because it bled into my mouth. I tried to find something else to eat but the selection was poor and I just couldn't get over the chicken. I go to get some ice cream and they have nothing but the last scrapings at the bottom of their bins. NEVER GOING THERE AGAIN"}
{"text":"I went here today for dinner, and I was quite disappointed. The shrimp and sashimi both left much to be desired. I'm used to eating seafood, and these were just strange. I've never tasted shrimp that were so flavorless. They were soaking in ice, which was rather odd. You literally had to fish out ice cubes to get the shrimp. I do not think it is worth the 13.99 dinner price. The service was great though. My waiter was very attentive and helpful. 

I went here before for lunch and it seemed like a much better deal. I just cant justify paying $5 extra for dinner for seafood that seems highly lacking."}
{"text":"The place was all right. I liked that they had a wide array of food to choose from, I just wish it were consistent and better. Some of the food, I found to be off, which could be a bit too salty, a bit too bland, a bit oddly tasting, or a bit cold for my liking. I appreciate that there was a mongolian grill, but I wish there were more options for me to put in my stir fry. The sushi, overall, was ok. I knew it was fresh, since there was a sushi chef there, putting sushi out. The sushi was hit or miss; I found some of it to be pretty decent and some to be kinda salty. The dessert pastries were dry, almost hard and their cheesecake was still a bit too hard from being frozen. The service was okay as well. It wasn't bad, but at some point in the visit, we had a few plates pile up and empty cups on the table for a bit before anyone came over to remove them or refill. So in comparison to other buffets, this one was just all right. It wasn't spectacular and it wasn't horrible; I would come back and maybe give this place another chance."}
{"text":"This is normally our fav place to eat - normally good sushi and great crab legs. Normally... last night EVERYTHING had been out for too long. The sushi rice was hard, the crab meat was grey inside the legs. Service at the table was great, but the food was horrible!  We likely won't return."}
{"text":"This is my family's(6 of us) most favorite place to eat out.    What makes this place different than other Chinese buffet is that it offers \"MONGOLIAN BBQ\" grill cooking.   Although it needs some improvement on variety of vegetables & its freshness, we like it enough to keep coming back to this place rather than going to other Chinese buffet.   Without Mongolian BBQ?   Well, I'll probably come back but not as often as now.   I can say that I'm coming because of Mongolian BBQ!!"}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying that I will never eat here again! While the staff was friendly and attentive, the food was not so great. It was cold and the noodles were hard. You could tell that the food had been sitting out for a really long time. I bit into the orange chicken and had to spit it right back out. I was very disappointed in this restaurant. Also, it was not very clean."}
{"text":"The manager didn't let my friend eat all you can eat \"Crawfish\" It was limited TWICE.  My friend and I went there a couple times and the first time my friend  was told by the maager that he could no longer have anymore crawfish after several trips to the crawfish dish. A year passed and we thought we'd give them one last shot.  This time they WOULDN'T refill the crawfish when it was gone.  We had went up there 3 times to fill up our tray and I guess they thought that was enough and told us NO WE WON'T REFILL THE CRAWFISH even after we asked nicely.  Whatever happened to ALL YOU CAN EAT? Well we found a better place that actually seasoned their crawfish with a spicy flavor and it is delicious! We go there almost every other weekend and get to eat ALL WE CAN EAT CRAWFISH! This new place had better service and better crawfish. I guess one good thing came out of this - we found a better place with better crawfish."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 4 times. I used to like it quit a bit.  The last time I went it was just gross. I think there loosing money and trying to cut there food quality. Plus it was 58 dollars for 4 of us. We could have gone to Texas road house."}
{"text":"if you like flies and shit food this place is for you!! They have sushi too its the best ;)"}
{"text":"The best Asian buffet I have ever had! This place has lots of foods that you cannot find in most Asian buffet restaurants. The sushi bar is really really good...The sushi is really gourmet, looks good and tastes great. Lunch is only like $8 after tax, and they have been giving $2 dollar off coupons out...I never had baked custard(like cream brulee), edy's icecream, and gourmet sushi in an Asian buffet place. I hope this place will not run out of business any time soon because buffet restaurants around the area aren't really not that great. Sushi definitely recommended. Dinner is a bit expensive, about $12/person, and the food is same as that during lunch. They also have a senior discount ($4.99) from 1pm-3pm. I really wonder if they make much profit as the lunch is so cheap and great...Service is good as well."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a fan this place but it definitely does not deserve a 5 star rating.  First off lets start with the decor.  While it was very nice when it first opened it's now getting a little raggedy looking and could use some updating.  Food wise this buffet is above average and definitely worth a visit.   If I could give them some advice it would be to get rid of  the HUGE salad buffet section or at least scale it way down and put that money into even more entree selections.  I've been coming here ever since they opened and hardly ever see anyone eating off the salad section.  So why spend so much money to have such a huge selection???   Put that money into the entree selection and make this place an even better value.  And for Gods sake bring back the Mayonnaise Shrimp !!  You made one of the best versions I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"The food was cold, very blan , wouldn't recommend this place to anyone , plus way overpriced"}
{"text":"Yes very salty, It's like Panda Express. But the crab legs flow like water there and they are never overcooked. Plus you never really have to fight over the crab legs like other buffets.  The food is good. And they have lots of sushi that is endless."}
{"text":"found this place on yelp.com since it didn't show thru the app kinda weird !! staff is very friendly specially cashier/hostess Joey. Food is full of flavor depending what you get. Hot n' sour soup is the bomb!!! . i would've put 5 stars if they had more spicy food variety other than that i'll be back !!!!"}
{"text":"since arriving at crazy buffet my experience was unwelcoming nobody greeted us. It took about 10 minutes before the waitress even acknowledged we were there and asked us what we wanted to drink. The crab puffs were the worst i ever seen.they did have alot to choose frpm but the quity of the food was below par the only good thing was that the waitress was very nice but over all i more than likely would return here or i wouldnt recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"This place used to be good. What the heck happened? Used to love the new one on Stapley and suddenly that shut down. Today our food was very greasy tasting, not very hot, crunchy lo mein noodles and visually unattractive dishes. Bathroom floors were dirty and nasty. We will never come back again. Terrible!"}
{"text":"You can enjoy large varityof chinese food ( dim sum..) sushi and mongolian BBQ that can satify your big stomach. But one thing they really need to improve is the cleaness of the restroom. Hopefully when I come back next time the restroom wont be a mess"}
{"text":"We first discovered Crazy Buffet back in Albuquerque. That location only lasted a few months, however, and we were pretty disappointed when it closed down. So we were pretty excited when we found out there was one here. I will say, however, for a Chinese buffet, this place is a bit pricey.

We've been to this location a couple of times. The food is pretty much what you expect for a Chinese buffet. Mediocre, mass-produced fried rice, appetizers and such. The thing that makes this place stand out amongst other Chinese buffets for us is the sushi. The sushi is actually pretty darn good here. The pieces are decently sized, the rice not too tacky or too loose. And you can eat as much as you'd like. No, it's not the best sushi in the world...but when you can't afford to go to a decent sushi place or you've got a hankering for a mish-mash of various Chinese dishes mixed in with some random American favorites (pizza &amp; chicken wings)...this is a pretty good place to go.

One thing that did disturb me a little last time we went (I hadn't been paying as much attention the previous visit) was just how much this place seems to be falling apart. Wallpaper peeling off the walls...that sort of thing. Kinda makes you wonder about sanitation, mold and all that gross stuff."}
{"text":"It's Friday evening  and no one is here. Not exaggerating. I was wondering why there were dozens of tables and at least 6-7 buffet tables and no one here.  Flavorless food.  As I sit here the waitresses are yelling back and forth in Asian language and laughing, oblivious to how rude and loud they are.  The staff is more busy trying to clean up and leave, than be certain their guests are satisfied.  We just returned from m living I  Japan for 2 years.  The Sushi here :questionable.  I was scared to try it.  Baked salmon, again questionable.  I tried a nibble and spit it out.  Vegetable delight?  More like they thought the found  way to use vegetables that otherwise would have gone in the trash.  Anyway, ever been to a nail salon where the employees just won't stop talking loudly during your nail service and pay no mind that you are in there spending money? Yep.  That's what it feels like now.  My family and I need to yell to each other to talk because the girl employees are so loud.  Sigh.... Anyway, I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"Received flyer today in mail. Crazy Buffet advertised NO CHOLESTEROL. It was near a picture of crab legs and oysters. If referring to this seafood, both contain cholesterol. If the advertisement was about their restaurant, that is also false. DON'T make ridiculous health claims."}
{"text":"I have never left this place without a smile on my face! The best buffet ever!! I love going there for dinner!! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Don't listen to these four and five star reviews, especially Rand H.. Listen to me! I'm warning you now, this place is beyond disgusting. My boyfriend and I decided to eat here after reading some positive reviews on yelp. I kid you not, this is one of the worst places I have ever eaten! Upon entering crazy buffet, I was initially pleasantly surprised because it was bigger than I had expected and had a lot of options to choose from. Once I sat down and took a bite out of my fully loaded plate I knew immediately that I had made a terrible mistake. I literally tried everything, in an attempt to find something that was edible. The fried rice and lo mein tasted like old fish. Every chicken dish was really oily and flavorless. Don't even get me started on the fish! I'm pretty sure that most of the fish in there was fake. The crab legs looked old and dry and like they could be made of plastic. The biggest tragedy of all was when the check came. $34 for two people and we barely even ate anything! There has never a time that I have felt so cheated. I really wanted to dine and dash but my boyfriend wouldn't let me. Do yourself a favor and go eat at Oregano's across the street, they've got good food and pizookies!"}
{"text":"The crazy in crazy Buffett does not stand for \"crazy good\". There is a wide variety but only a few dishes were worth eating. Some items such as the oysters on the half shell had been sitting out too long. The family agreed that many items just tasted strange. And for three adults at dinner the bill was about $50. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite chinese places! 

I love to take my mom here. We have very different ideas of what good Chinese food is and this place leaves us both satisfied. It's very affordable - I think it's around $10 per person for dinner and that includes all you can eat Sushi!! ^0^ 

I love the soups and sauteed entrees, they're very good. In the back corner, there's the specialty items!! Some of them are dishes are a little too exotic for me but they smell amazing!! someday I'll get the gumption to try them! 

I would totally recommend this place to anyone who likes chinese food! It's a little hidden in a strip mall location. They have awesome sushi and I especially love nigiri! :) and all your time tested chinese-american favorites as well as some thing you've never seen before! oh! and ICE CREAM!! whoo!! who doesn't want to end a meal with all you can eat dryer's ice cream??? Go and get a little crazy!! :)"}
{"text":"Meh. Seriously, meh. I would never have chosen to come here on my own but my office group picked here for our end-of-year luncheon so I was sort of obligated. It's just kind of....well....it's gross, frankly. I already get weirded out by buffets but this one was really gross. The \"sushi\" is so disgusting and nothing is labeled so you have no idea what you're even putting on your plate since many of them are fried, which means they are soggy since they've been sitting out god knows how long. The order to things is bizarre. They have donuts next to shrimp next to fried rice and apple pie next to pizza but then they have a whole separate section for desserts? The food was bland, oily and lukewarm. Ugh, never again. If my work picks this place again, I'll feign the stomach flu."}
{"text":"Beware!!!! There were a lot of flies, which would rest on me while I was grabbing food and while I was about to eat. They have sushi, but if you grab any sushi or certain other items you will be charged for dinner price even if its lunch. I sat down to eat and realized that the food was lukewarm. Buffets are supposed to maintain a temperature of 135 and higher. I told the waitress I was unwilling to eat the food especially the sushi. The waitress seem to be used to this and did not say a word to me. I walked out and will never return. Please, I would hate for anyone to get food poisoning... Do not eat here unless they are willing to make serious immediate changes."}
{"text":"I've been to this buffet three times, and on all three occasions I ended up with the same conclusion: Next time just go for the sushi!

The sushi is surprisingly good. In fact, it is good enough that it has replaced the co-fusion's Monday special deal for me. I mean, I have to eat some 15 pieces of sushi to feel not hungry, which will cost me something like $18 in co-fusion. Instead, I go the crazy buffet for lunch, fill myself up with decent sushi (and other Chinese food!)  for a mere $8 (dinner is $12 if I'm not wrong). 

To be honest, I didn't find other types of food they have to be as good as other Chinese restaurants. But who cares?! Viva la sushi!

edit: On weekends (at least on Sundays) they only have seafood, for $11.99 all day.

Edit: I have to take one star. Unfortunately like many other restaurants, the food quality has dropped. The menu of sushi has reduced in variety, there is no more frog legs to be found, and the Mizo soup isn't as good as before. even for 2 times, they weren't using the correct ingredients for it!"}
{"text":"I came here countless times for lunch on half-days during my high school years, and  this place was always the premier destination for my group of friends. I always started off with an enormous plate of sushi and some hot and sour soup. Then, I'd go through the dishes and pick heaping amounts of whatever I craved that day. At the end of the meal, there was always buckets of ice cream to try out. 

After high school, I realized that the quality of the food is fairly mediocre, and I rarely go anymore. However, it's always a fun place to go if you're with a group of people who just want to hang out, relax, and eat as much as you want.

Overall, Crazy Buffet offers a variety of filling food and is a perfect destination for anyone who wants buffet food for relatively cheap."}
{"text":"I hate buffets but I love this place.  All the food is delicious and the endless oysters is enough to make me go back!"}
{"text":"This is weird for me because I don't usually like Chinese food. The food here was actually pretty good. My daughter really liked the teriaky chicken and orange sherbet. I did not care for any of the soups though. 

Why three stars? You get a weird kind of feeling from the staff here. They don't come around and take your dirty plates so we ended up putting them in a dish cart parked next to the kitchen. Once they discovered what we were doing they took the cart away. We ended up putting the dirty dishes on the clean table behind us. 

Toward the end they ran out of clean spoons (I assume) because they came around and handed us plastic spoons to eat our cake with. Very strange. Also, the bathroom smelled awful and they were pumping cold air into it. You certainly didn't want to spend a lot of time in there.

I would go back however because all around we had fun trying the many dishes they offered."}
{"text":"I'm typically almost never a fan of the buffet dinner, as typically I find that the food is so-so at best.  Thus was the case for Crazy Buffet.  I started with the mongolian; however there really wasn't much variety to it.  Very bland.  I picked up what I thought was one spice, and after it was cooked realized it was something else.  My bad.  Next, went to look at the Chinese food.  If you like the fried/battered stuff, there was lots of options.  Nothing stood out there either.  Next, went on to the sushi, which is where I spent most of my dinner.  Was decent for a buffet place, but certainly not as good as sushi places that I've been to.

Overall, it's a good option when you have a crowd and the request was a generic \"Chinese\" as they have a lot of options."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that my boyfriend and I often go to Chinese/Japanese buffets.  We especially like the ones that offer sushi as well as traditional fare.

With that in mind, we decided to check out this so-called Crazy Buffet. This place is utter garbage.  No lie, no joke.  We went after hearing everyone rave about how incredibly awesome the food was, how nicely decorated it was and how nice the staff was.

Lies!  Either that or they slip some sort of mind-altering narcotic into the food of people who do claim to have enjoyed the place.

Let's start with our table.  It was filthy.  Not food particles everywhere, dirty. It was sticky as though the busboy took the plates but couldn't be bothered to wipe it down.  Every surface was sticky - seat, table, everything on it.

We should have left then - but no, we had a coupon - so in the interest of being thrifty, we stayed for an inexpensive meal.

That was a complete and utter mistake.  I don't expect five star food, but I do expect the sushi to not smell rotten or have a faint taste that says it is mere seconds from spoiling.  Nor do I expect that the hot food will be so greasy that I could go lube my engine, allowing me to never have to use motor oil again.

Needless to say, I hardly ate anything at all.  What little I did eat, made me copiously and violently ill for the rest of the weekend.

It was a disgusting experience, one I care to never repeat."}
{"text":"This is a nice buffet with a decent selection. I like to go on the weekends for the seared tuna but it is very good for lunch also. They have a decent selection of sushi, lots of chinese food, shrimp, crayfish, and imitation crab, etc. They also have a very nice salad bar. 
The service here has always been very good, they are very nice and kept my glass full. 
It is pretty inexpensive, about $18 plus tip for two people at lunch. 

Overall a better than average buffet experiance, I will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"It's more 3.5 than 4 stars.

You're typical Asian Buffet. I'd say it's similar to Pacific in Chandler. The booths need to be re-upholstered in my opinion, but service is decent.

They have a mix of your normal greasy Chinese food options, a sushi bar selection with Sashimi and crab legs. 

It's fairly cheap for a buffet."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with fellow yelpers Robyn N.,Arlin B. and Rand H. and unlike Rand I thought the new crazy buffet was better than the other one.It is brand new with nice decor and the food choices were much tastier. They had BBQ beef ribs that tasted like they were soaked in pineapple orange juice (very good) also the crispy chicken,shrimp bisque,and Chinese pork that were also yummy. they had a good variety of sweets too. Chocolate covered strawberries as well as plain fresh strawberries,fresh kiwi which I have never seen before at a Chinese buffet. So if you like a good Chinese buffet the new Crazy Buffet is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Food is average to below average. Crab legs are small and skinny. Had to ask for fresh food to be made on a sat. night at 8pm.  Although the sushi was fresh and tasty. The coconut shrimp was good too. Don't think I will be back tho.."}
{"text":"I really can't say enough about this place; clean, with rather prompt service(although several of my servers clearly don't know English, and I had to hope a manager was around to interpret the fact that I need an entire carafe of water).

their variety is fantastic--sushi(I prefer the deep-fried rolls--but be careful, it's hit-or-miss with some of the fish in the sushi rolls), endless crab legs on Fridays, tons of dumplings, shumai, scallion pancakes, rangoons, wontons, fresh fruit and edamame, etc etc"}
{"text":"We came for a second meal, and it was just average. The real trouble started when we got home...

Both my father and I got so terribly sick that we spent the entire weekend lingering around the bathrooms at home. I warned him not to eat the shrimp, buffet shrimp is always a bad idea, so I'm not sure what made us sick but both of us got severely sick and this was the only place we ate at together.

It's against health code when they add the old food to a fresh dish of new food, but you see them do it all the time. 

I'll never go back. You could not pay me money to eat here again. On the plus side I, lost several pounds. Hell of a diet."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever it smells bad as soon as you walk in the door the food is old the crabs are old & smell bad Mac n cheeses is orange from sitting under the light too long ice cream machine is broken so the have a freezer w/ a scoop where you dip your own icecream so who knows what disease you may catch there I wonder when the health board has been there last the soda was good they should be called the gross stale buffet"}
{"text":"Overpriced at $11, bland food, dried out sushi, tough roast beef.   The staff was very friendly, but the food was bad.  The seafood looked doubful.  I wouldn't have paid half the priced for the food.  But $11 was way too much.  

It is in a large shopping area with many better resturants like Chilis and Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"Been here twice in the last 2 months, everything was great. The restaurant is very clean, and even has a nice look to it, much more so then many other buffets I've visited in the valley. The bathroom was also clean and kept up. 

The food was excellent. The crab legs alone are an exceptional deal, all you can eat, hot, meaty, fresh and plentiful.  It seems to me that most everyone comes esp for the crab legs which are served every night and well worth the $13.99 on their own. 

The sushi was also very good with a wide assortment which includes sashimi. If you are inclined, they also have steamed clams, raw oysters on the half shell, mussels, shrimp and craw-fish, as well as plenty of fish dishes. 

There is so much food to choose from, you really have to zero in on what you like best, it is just to much to have a little of everything. Everything is well prepared and lacks nothing, no cheap tasting canned stuff. Hope they keep up the quality, it is a new favorite for my family."}
{"text":"Average service, ehh food wise, was not impressed. Didn't really enjoy my visit there... I rather eat elsewhere for better quality food."}
{"text":"As far as Chinese Buffet's go this place it pretty consistent. Now that most Buffet's are huge chains it's nice that this one is still family owned. I'm allergic to seafood so I stay clear of the Sushi bar, but friends have e told me its above average. They offer tons of all your favorite things typical of american flair Chinese. Orange chicken, pepper chicken is my favorite, great egg foo young, pork dumplings are great as are the spring rolls and their fresh salads are pretty good as well, cucumber with tomatoes and onions, coleslaw are yummy. All in all I give Crazy buffet 3 solid stars. It hits the spot when I need my fix. Ice cream bar is a plus, no crappy soft serve only Bryers served here."}
{"text":"Can't say I'm too crazy about this place anymore. Haven't been here for a while and it seems the place has gone downhill. Grabbed a bunch of crab legs and most of them were empty inside and rubbery. They lack flavor and were small and watered down. I picked out a few of my favorite dishes but I really did come there for the crab legs. Was very disappointed in the price which has also gone up since I've been there. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"We went for their dinner service. 12.99/ person.

The sweet treats were stale.
The sushi section were not fresh either.
Majority of their menu/dish were chicken.
Our server only visited us twice - to bring water & the tab. And no. It was not busy.
Their shrimp on ice tasted \"fishy\" and odd consistency.
The beef broccoli was decent. :)
The rest was simply too oily for us.
For 12.99/person, we expected loads better service, and quality of food.

Xx"}
{"text":"As I was surveying the places near my work to eat I was hoping that this was a different alternative to the Panda Express closeby. 

Not so much. I believe I paid something like $9 and everything was drenched in oil. I thought maybe I'd hit a goldmine by getting tons of sushi, but it's just mediocore and tempura coated pieces were just soggy. Hot and sour soup tasted obscenely sour. I didn't even go back to get seconds (even though I ALWAYS) do this at a buffet- not because I was full, but because my stomach could not agree with me.

They are pretty quick in cleaning up after your plates, so quick that if you accidently left food on it, they'll still take it.. so don't leave your food alone at your table if you're planning to return to eat it.

Payment is due after your meal, strange but true. This is supposed to be an Asian buffet, but there's nothing Asian or authentic about the food."}
{"text":"I have eaten at several chinese buffets all around town.  I decided on this one based on other reviews here.  I found the food to be OK - not anything really spectacular.  The sushi did not taste fresh, and the rice was a little old.  I was surprised by this considering we went there for dinner on a Friday night.  I probably won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know if the previous reviewers have actually ever tasted proper Chinese food, but this place is disgusting. My wife and I came here solely on recommendations from Yelp! We have never been steered wrong before but I think the reviewers of this establishment have NO idea what they are talking about.

Not only was everything slathered in grease and corn syrup (if you've cut High Fructose Corn Syrup out of your diet you will know exactly what I mean), but it was either overcooked or completely devoid of anything edible. I tried a little bit of everything to make sure it wasn't just one dish, but everything was consistently terrible.  Their teriyaki chicken had nothing but sugar-coated skin and fat in the pieces served (Gross!!!)

Everything was bland and had no flavor other than the horribly sweet sauces they poured on everything. The sushi bar was adequate for an all-you-can-eat establishment, but that did not save the $13/person meal (not including drinks) that we unfortunately had to pay for. 

I also have to say that basing a restaurant's overall rating on that amount of seating available is just absurd. If I'm going to shell out my hard-earned money I could care less if there are lots of booths to sit at. The food needs to be good and anyone who considers this food anywhere close to enjoyable should have their Yelp! accounts deactivated (if that's possible).

DO NOT GO HERE! SAVE YOUR MONEY! There's a YCs Mongolian Grill down the street if you want decent food."}
{"text":"Some places are best left to fond memories of a distant past, and this in one, a mere shell of what it used to be years ago.  Then - long lines of patrons.  Now - no lines and an empty dining room.  Then - hot, flavorful food with a seemingly endless selection.  Now - chicken, chicken, and more chicken, luke warm in temperature, flavorless, some tasting stale and overcooked.  Then - you got tiny bites of dishes hoping to taste them all (never happened).  Now - none of it looks appetizing.  

The price is high for what you get. I can't imagine they'll be in business much longer."}
{"text":"This is a BUFFET, not a gourmet restaurant, let's keep that in mind, people!  In comparison to buffets, this one is the king of the bunch.  It's heads and shoulders above any Golden Corral/Country Harvest Buffet/CiCi's Pizza.  They have an amazing variety of asian foods - sushi, chinese dishes, soups, mongolian barbeque, a huge salad bar, desserts, and best of all? ALL U EAT CRAB LEGS!!!! I've a frequent visitor to Joe's Crab Shack and Red Lobster, but none are worth it compared to here.  Between 2 people @ Joe's/Red Lobster it's easy to drop $90-$100 and only get about 6 crab legs and a filet of fish, whereas $25-$30 @ Crazy Buffet will get you all the crab legs, popcorn shrimp, and sushi you crave.  Easily the best buffet in the Valley."}
{"text":"I got sick. I don't know what it was but I definitely felt it for a very long time after I left."}
{"text":"Not bad for price. $8.50 for lunch. Kids $4-6. Some sushi, crayfish, mussels. Mostly Chinese food. Also some kid food like Mac and cheese, pizza, wings, fries. Very good pickles. Dinner is $13.50 but haven't tried it yet. Not sure what is different about lunch and dinner. Also lots of ice cream choices."}
{"text":"For me personally, the food was meh. There's not much food you can choose, just like some other typical restaurant. The sushi is great though but the crab legs were meh for me"}
{"text":"I met a client here for lunch yesterday. It was his choice and since I really enjoy working with him and consider him a Friend; I figured why not. 

Easy parking that's for sure. 

Nice big dining room that does not feel cramped, seemed clean too. 

A lot to choose from as far as food goes. 

The wait person was smiling and checked on our drinks often. 

What I ate was decent, but did not eat much since I was talking and talking and talking. 

So it for me is worth another visit when I am not planning on talking so much and get to try more of the food. 

So yeah I will be back.........."}
{"text":"In Short: Selection is average, the taste could be better.  Try the hot pot on the weekend, probably the best thing there.

The best thing about it is the spacious atmosphere, where you are not packed in like sardines.  The selection is about average to any other buffet.  You can find the typical chinese selections, some sushi, and dessert.  Only thing is that it's all oily and salty, flavor of the ingredients are lost in thick sauces.  It's fairly cheap so if you just want to stuff your stomach with random food, it's perfectly fine.

One thing that does set this place apart is the ho pot.  I think it's only available on the weekends but I maybe wrong.  They provide you with a burner and either spicy or mild flavored stew.  Then you can pick your veggies and meats, then have at it."}
{"text":"Kudos for crab legs and huge portions of desserts :) I love the sashimi as well! Definitely come back! Good service!"}
{"text":"I wish i can put less then one star .this by far the worst place i have ever been to. Food was either cold , burned .and after i finally found an item that it tasted okay .they take it away and they put the crab legs instead and said do not touch .bottem line i will never cone back here again"}
{"text":"After our upsetting visit to Sushiya last nite, we ended up here for dinner.  We had to find someplace fast since my daughter had to work the night shift and we had only 1.5 hours before she had to leave for work.  We wasted over an hour at that darn Sushiya restaurant.

I have been to Crazy's on Priest many, many, many times.  This location is smaller and has better lighting.  And they had some things on the menu that the Priest location does not.  For the price, I think that this place is very good.  They have almost as many items on the menu as Pacific Seafood Buffet, but their pricing is $6 per head less.  

My comments:  I loved their hot/sour soup.  I loved their Chinese pickled pigs feet.  I thought their short ribs were OK as was their steam flounder with ginger and onions.  I mentioned in a post of the Priest location that the Italian shrimp scampi and pasta dish was good and they had it here too -- my daughter loved it too and said she was pleasantly surprised that this dish was on a buffet menu and was very good.

Comment of wifey and daughter:  Snow crab legs were smaller than Pacific Seafood, but tasted better since they were steamed and not boiled and left swimming in water like at Pacific Seafood.  The short ribs were more tender here and the pieces of meat were bigger.  Sushi selection here is not as good as Pacific, but for the price, who's complaining?  My wife said the deep fried blue point crabs were very good here.  

So in conclusion, we will be back.  Very good value to price ratio."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for his sister's birthday. The place is just okay in my opinion, but he was not a fan and said the bathrooms were gross. Overall, not impressed and we probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"What the hell happened to this place...maybe I'm being a stickler about a buffet but this is just depressing.  No fried calamari......All the food is cold at the start of dinner.  Crab legs are like dried up carrots...never again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday with two friends.  I was a little disappointed with the food.  The pricing still has not changed much, although they advertise \"new lower prices\".  And of course, they still charge extra for the drink, even though their advertising coupons say \"drink now included in meal purchase price\".  WTF????

My opinion is the entrees are not as good as before and the available choices are no better than the other cheap Chinese buffets.  Even though the prices are higher, Pacific Seafood Buffet is better and probably worth the higher price.

However, the salad bar has some better salads on it --- Caesar salad, spinach salad, etc. etc.  And the other funny and amusing thing is they have a few Americanized dishes on the buffet that are pretty good.  They have a baked or roasted garlic/herb chicken dish that is pretty good and they have a pasta dish --- angel hair pasta with a cream and cheese sauce with shrimp in it that is pretty darn good.

So I guess if I had the Caesar salad or spinach salad, the chicken, a serving of the angel hair with shrimp pasta, and the garlic bread, I could have had a nice big, satisfying Italian lunch.  And for the price, $9.00 in total, that would not be bad.

Maybe I will do that the next time..........."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch today planning to get take out, but when I found out they charge by the pound, I figured I might as well eat in.  I was dining solo and had some studying to do....it was busy but not too noisy and beverage service was very prompt.

I would have to agree that many of the traditional entrees are greasy.  This seems to be standard and typical with most buffets and small, divey chinese joints.  I tend to steer clear of these items as I enjoy fresher, lighter food ,and I found plenty of selection here.  Starting off with cucumber salad, seaweed salad (good if you like unusual flavors and textures), sushi, shrimp/squid entrees, grilled chicken w/ spicey chinese BBQ sauce, jasmine rice etc.   There were plenty of fried items if that's your thing which actually looked fairly appetizing and the desert selection seemed very adequate."}
{"text":"Ugh. Never again. This is by far the WORST Chinese food I have EVER had. Trust me on this one! STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"With two 4-star reviews I thought I was in for a treat. There was lots of food, but none of it was fresh. I tried a few items and they were all old and luke-warm at best. Since none of the food looked good, I thought I would try the hibatchi grill. I piled up my plate with some food and looked around only to see no one available to grill my food. I placed my plate on the edge of the grill and wandered around for several minutes before someone finally came out. To make matters worse, the chef intended on giving me unflavored food with no self-serve sauces available. When I asked to have sauce on my grilled food he said that only soy sauce was available. None of the ingredients were quality (dark meat chicken and old veggies), and with no sauce, the dish was flavorless. 

I asked the waitress when hot, fresh food would be coming. She asked the manager, who was eating his dinner while doing something with his laptop, and she came back and mentioned that there's no specific time for fresh food to come out, but it would be coming in waves. I arrived at 4:15pm and left at 5:30pm, during which time trays sat empty and only the lo mein, pot stickers, fried rice and teriyaki chicken was replaced. I tried the new teriyaki chicken, but it tasted old and was also just luke-warm, almost like it had been cooked early in the morning and sitting in the back all day. After striking out on everything else, I tried some pizza. I literally spit out the only bite I took because it tasted like they used ketchup instead of pizza sauce. I ended up eating the only edible items on the buffet -- fruit and salad -- for dinner."}
{"text":"Sunday 1/27/13  Two adult couples, we decided to go to lunch and since none of us had ever been here we thought we would give it a try. OUR 1st suggestion is to read and trust these reviews. Dingy dirty entryway welcomed us into Crazy Buffet. Polite hostess sat us and got us our drink order. We all got up and hit the buffet. Nothing and I mean nothing looked fresh!  We thought about leaving but decided to look at the sushi counter. Selected a few choices all boring and none had any flavor. Our buffet selections were worse. Everything tasted like it had been sitting there for days. Two shrimp dishes tasted awful-old awful! All of the buffet dishes were luke warm if warm at all. The big finish was a small freezer that holds 6 big tubs of ice cream that looked as old as the building. Its self serve-oh boy. Two teenage boys showed us how it worked. You open the filthy top and reach your upper body inside the freezer. After the one wearing a tank top got practically inside to get his icecream we decided to get out of here. At this time a guy there alone was telling our server that all of the food was cold! A manager came over and in his best English he explained that he had to turn on the A/C and thus the food is now cold??  This guy had just gotten there and barely ate a thing. They gave him a discount, not a refund. He told us outside he ended up paying $ 14.00 for nothing. I can assure you that darn near 100% of the Phoenix area restaurants have A/C.  I can't wait to ask the Board of Health on Monday morning  if that is permissable to not keep the food on a buffet at a safe level."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying I made a yelp account just to rate this restaurant.

My husband and I used to go to Great China buffet on Cactus, but unfortunately they closed a few months ago.  We were really in the mood for Chinese buffet tonight, so I went on Yelp to see if I could find one.  The review for Crazy buffet looked pretty good and after I saw it was Rand H's #1 pick for Chinese buffets we decided to give it a try.  

When we got there the hostess and one of the waitresses stood at the counter chatting for nearly 5 minutes before they stopped their conversation to seat us.  

We started off with some sushi.  It was OK.  Not horrible but not really great either.  Then we tried the hot items.  Every chicken dish was horrible.  The chicken was dry dry dry!!  I tried stab a piece of teriyaki chicken with my fork and it was so hard it just went flying off my plate.  All of the sauces were terrible too.  They all tasted similar, like a bottle of syrup had been dumped over a pile of overcooked chicken.  

Normally our favorite thing to eat at a Chinese buffet is shrimp.  The shrimp dishes we tried were awful.  The salt and pepper shrimp was rubbery.  The fried shrimp were 80% breading and hard as rocks, the tartar sauce was absolutely disgusting too.  It tasted like mayonnaise with a cup of sugar thrown into it.  The only edible item was the butter shrimp.  

The fried rice and chow mien were both tasteless.  The rangoons were OK.  The egg rolls were horrible.  They were soggy and tasted like nothing.

All of this was pretty bad but I have to say I think the worst thing we tried was the hot and sour soup.  My husband got a bowl and I took a taste of it.  It tasted like lemon water with peppers in it.

We've been to other buffets since Great China closed.  None of them were good, but what really compelled me to write this review is what happened when we got the check.  They charged us almost $2 each for our drinks.  I have NEVER been to a buffet that charges for soda before in my life.  On our way out I looked at their price menu, there's no mention that drinks aren't included and no pricing for drinks.  I realize this is only $4 but it's the principle.  I feel cheated!!  Our check was almost $35!!  We could have gone to Jade Palace and had a meal we both actually enjoyed for that much!"}

{"text":"A dear friend introduced me to Crazy Buffet years ago. 

I enjoy it for its versatility. Generally, I go for the sushi, the beef and broccoli and the peppered pork dish.

I find that the food is always fresh and the service is always attentive and swift. It seems that the crab legs are very popular here. And I mean very. It has been on multiple occasions that I have found groups of people coming in seemingly only for the crab legs. You will find people making mounds on their plates and ordering little else. 

I have not tried the crab legs. What's wrong with me. 

But, in all, a great place for families and the brave singles who cannot wait a minute longer for an abundant display of nigiri and sashimi offerings."}
{"text":"Ever since moving to Tucson, I've visited my parents who live in the Chanlder/Pheonix area.  Every time I drive up, they always suggest that we go to Crazy Buffet for dinner.  Now, I'm not a fan of buffet - insert here images of hastily cooked, calorie dense food items - but for this place I make an exception.  The reason being, I come here for the all-you-can-eat crab legs.

The rest of the food is ordinary Chinese buffet type foods, broccoli and beef, the mayo-oyster thing, stir fried beans, 1-2 run of the mill dim sum and sushi (think california rolls), ice cream (I do not go out to eat ice cream that I already have in my freezer), and bland-looking cookies and fruit.  But the all-you-can-eat crab legs!

Whenever I go with my family, we immediately go and fill up a platter with steamed crab legs and start digging in.  Eventually, we are up to our elbow in crab shells.  Other places, I've had steamed crab that is either too salty (why?) or rubbery or just off in taste but this is not the case here.  I usually don't eat too much else of anything offered at the buffet (why pay $18 for ordinary Americanized Chinese food?).  I usually end my gorging of crab by a couple of bites of the orange slices and call it day!  

The wait staff is totally nice and I've never gotten a dirty look when I come back to my table with a plate laden with crab legs... They actually are really nice and quick about clearing away used plates, refilling drinks, etc.

Oh, they only have the crab legs at dinner time, NOT lunch time!

A favorite trick of my to eating crab legs... take a segment, crack it gently down the middle and pry open the two halves.  You can then fish out the crab all in one piece!  Delicious!"}
{"text":"We haven't been here in a long while.  Not impressed, most of the food is cold. Crab legs have no taste or just taste gross. 
Terriyaki chicken was dry as was the sweet &sour chicken, pork ribs too fatty. 
Not coming back."}
{"text":"This place just keeps going down, and their prices keep coming up. Their sushi used to be good. The rolls were obviously from another day, or frozen, or something. Bad bad, My drink didn't come until after my second helping of cold fried rice. Who messes up fried rice?? I was so pissed I left without ice cream, then got my bill. 18$ are you out of your mind? I could have eaten three times at Golden Eggroll for that! Garbage. Crab legs, garbage. Sushi, garbage. Chicken, garbage. Service, you guessed it trash. Never going back."}
{"text":"So disappointing. The food used to be good. But today they charged more (Sunday) and had fewer Chinese food selections. Unless bad Mac and cheese is now Chinese.

The sushi choices were limited and mostly made of fake krab. 

We used to enjoy coming here. But it has been going down hill and today will be our last visit."}
{"text":"Another buffet. This one has a mix of Asian and American dishes. It was ok. Nothing really stands out, though there was prime rib in the dinner buffet. It was a little dry, but pretty good.

The sushi was adequate.  They didn't have a chocolate dessert, though (I don't count pudding...I'm thinking cake, brownie, pie...not pudding).

Except for the presence of self-serve prime rib and ham, this buffet is just another face in the crowd.  If it's convenient, it's fine.  But I wouldn't make a special trip to come here.

Though they did tell me \"no MSG\", so that's a plus.

We went as part of a large group.  They were happy to cordon off part of the restaurant for us, which also is a plus if you are bringing a group."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to go here a lot, but under new management and different workers, the food just isn't that great anymore."}
{"text":"Just an update. I was happy to find out they now have crab legs.  They were great on restocking the legs and even kept some in another area for anyone who wanted colder legs.  At the tempe location the legs are always gone but here they were kept restocked so I was happy.  Sushi still good. Love the fruit area. Still enjoyable, the price is eh but for all the crab legs you want I guess its pretty decent."}
{"text":"I use to love this place until their prices went up and their food got spicier (sp?).  Someone over there loves the pepper. They do have the best crab legs for a buffet. They always keep the bin full not like other places that refill it every hour or so.  You can get yourself a good size portion and will not be disappointed. They have the best green tea ice cream there, even if its Dreyers, its always good and fresh. Very clean place and nice atmosphere. I just wish not all their dishes were spicy."}
{"text":"....LOVE this place!  ...Out of ALL of the Chinese Buffet places I've been to, this one has been the best, with the biggest selection! ...Lots of booths to sit at. The Food is always good."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place because we were in the area and hungry. The food was all lack luster and bland like the owners don't care. I saw items that looked like they were sitting there for days. The crab legs had not flavor and didn't taste right. My wife said she saw an employee push food off the counter back into the food for the general public. They had vanilla pudding with crunchy cookies that was disgusting it runny and the cookies were soggy. The name of the restaurant is fitting because it's crazy to eat here."}
{"text":"As far as Chinese buffets go, this one is just okay.  Nothing really stood out to me, the food was pretty much the usual and same as most buffets of this type.  It's dark and rather dated inside.  The service is good, they kept my water filled and the dishes cleared.

The best part is the mongolian bbq, lots of veggies and in addition to beef/chicken/shrimp/pork - they also offered lamb, yum! and fake crab, ick!

For chinese buffets, I'd prefer any of the hibachi grills or a china city which I think are a cut above this place.  Won't go out of my way to come back here again."}
{"text":"My husband loves this place but its not my favorite. The food is alright it's the best when it's fresh but that's a rare occasion it seems like. The restaurant area doesn't seem to clean. It's a good price but I rather drive the extra 5 minutes, pay the extRa  $6 and go to Hong Kong buffet"}
{"text":"Meh... Used to be good but long in the tooth now and obvious in food quality is not doing well."}
{"text":"Weird name, but pretty good food. Typical Chinese-style buffet offerings, but with some Japanese specialties thrown in. Near ASU."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and not terribly busy during a Friday lunch meeting with one of my coworkers. This is definitely one of the best Chinese buffets I've had the pleasure of visiting. We almost drove past, but am so happy we stopped in."}
{"text":"This place is defenantly worth the money. The best is they include all you can eat peel-and-eat shrimp. The food was good and the place was clean and the servers were very attentive. Not the type place to take someone to impress them, but a great place if you are hungry for some Chinese."}
{"text":"Crazy Buffet? Sure. You've got to be crazy like it.

This place is to good Chinese as McDonalds is to burgers. I will give them props for diversity - the Octopus salad was unique.

However, what was not appreciated (or cute... c'mon baby octopi are adorable!)  were the endless vats of melting ice cream, over cooked fish, luke warm soups and limp vegetables... Though... Their Bok Choy was amazingly well seasoned. Props to you on that.

Hubby, who's a Navy sailor of 24 years and a sushi aficionado, couldn't stomach the warm sushi... That's kind of sad. He's a sailor... Fishy things are his complete forte. Pun intended."}
{"text":"my husband and I ate here last night for the first time after living down the street from this place for nearly three years.

The food is ok, but I've definitley had better Chinese food. The won ton soup was not very good. The broth was a bright yellow color which should have been my clue that it wasn't going to taste too good. The won tons were too doughy and after a few spoonfuls I was done. 
The lo mein, stuffed mushrooms and the california rolls were decent. 

One thing I did not get, but my husband tried out was chicken feet. Yep, a claw! It made me sick just looking at this claw on his plate. He said it wasn't very good. 

I didn't use the bathroom here, but my husband did and he said the bathroom alone made him never want to go back to this place. He said it was filthy and run down.
Also the ice cream scooper in the dessert area had been sitting in a bucket of ice cream water and my husband said it looked as if there were teeth marks on the scooper. I just envisioned some little kid gnawing on the scooper at some point for it to look like that. 

This place wasn't horrible, the service was friendly and I'm sure if I ever have the beer munchies I would hit this place up."}
{"text":"Ok if you come for an early lunch to beat the rush forget about it.  They open at 1030 but are not ready to truly serve until 1100. It's a Chinese buffet so I'm not expecting much but at least be ready for your customers to eat if you say you're opened."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly good!  My boyfriend and I decided to check out the dinner buffet based on the review on this site and we were very pleased with it overall.

The main attraction for us was the sushi bar.  I was trying not to get my hopes up because sushi at Chinese buffets is typically subpar; but, surprisingly, they got it right!  It was a little bit lesser quality than what you'd get in a sushi restaurant, but very tasty.  They have a wide variety of maki rolls (california, spicy tuna, and maybe a crazy roll), nigiri, and had some hand rolls if you were quick enough.  Typically if you got the sushi right after it was made it was fantastic.  The sashimi (of which there is also several different types) was fairly good, though obviously not as fresh as it would be if you got it from a sushi bar.  There was a chef who was making things for people behind the counter, too.

We actually stayed away from the \"typical\" Chinese buffet stuff, but it was all there.  Egg drop soup, hot and sour, crab rangoon, some dumplings and steamed buns with red bean paste, beef and mushrooms, fried chicken dishes smothered in sauce.  I had some of the beef and mushrooms and I'm afraid that's part of the reason the rating isn't higher: quality of meat is not so good.  The mushrooms tasted fresh and were pretty big, which is good because I love mushrooms.

The other part of the buffet besides the sushi bar worth noting was the selection of seafood.  There were baby octopi, bbq squid legs, king crab legs (pretty meaty, too!), clams, mussels, and shrimp. 

Another thing that surprised me was that this buffet had miso soup!  This was especially good since I picked trying out this buffet instead of going to a tried and true sushi place.

The dessert bar(s) were pretty fantastic as well.  They have about seven types of ice cream: green tea (!), butter pecan, coffee, mint chocolate chip, orange, chocolate, and vanilla.  Their other desserts included many kinds of jello, cream puffs, typical Chinese buffet pastries, and some kind of coconut cookie thing that tasted like a baked Almond Joy.

Our bill totaled out to ~$33 including tip and a pot of tea for two people.  So, it's a little on the expensive side, but I would consider it a viable alternative to going out to a fancy sushi place, especially if you're going with a group of pickier eaters.  While the sushi's not quite as good and there's less choice, you get to eat more of it.  If you add in the miso soup and green tea ice cream for dessert, it would probably come out to the same price at a sushi place for two people.  And you get all the other stuff, too!  

Much better than China Town buffet, just based on the sushi, for about the same price."}
{"text":"Crab legs, yum! Those big long orange things that require nut crackers to navigate-they've got 'em! Mussels, salmon, shumai (that steamed snacky stuff)-they got 'em! A huge salad bar-check! Mongolian BBQ-check! Sushi bar-check! And rows and rows of other Chinese entrees, from ribs to vegetable dishes, beef and chicken dishes galore, chicken on a stick, you-name-it! Dessert-check. They have not only fruits and puddings and cakey things, but also ice cream and sherbet and soft ice cream. It's Crazy! That is, Crazy Buffet!

There is something for everyone here. It was decently prepared and pretty fresh, too. TIP: if you are a senior, ask for the senior discount. It is not posted. Range for dinner as of this writing: $11.99 or low $10 range for seniors over 60. Seating is huge: a group would do well here. They even have a special room that has doors that close for private functions.

Location is kind of set back in a strip mall, in the corner. Not so easy to see from the road, so look for it. Easy parking. Our server (mostly for drinks) was very friendly and accommodating to the many children surrounding us (I had some wee company visiting me from the neighboring booth while eating)."}
{"text":"It's like Panda Express, with extra salt. However, the crab legs are legit and HOW MUCH??? THIRTEEN BUCKS??!?!? 

CRAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYY ZEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Crazy buffet had pretty decent food! It was better than I expected. It also helped that one of the servers (possibly a manager) LOVED my husband and kept coming over every 10min saying \"Ryan, can I get you anything? Ryan, would you like more iced tea? Ryan, you're so lucky you have a beautiful wife (of course he gets points for flattery lol)\" We were in a group of about 10, but he was seemed to only want to serve Ryan. Haha it was pretty funny.

The selection was good--standard fare. We were there for dinner so we had a TON of crab legs. Just that alone was worth the money. The sushi bar was good too--better sushi than I've seen at other buffet. They had unagi sushi too, which is usually kinda pricey, so it was generous of them to serve that. 

They had a mongolian stir fry station where they would cook toppings you'd choose yourself. I didn't notice this until I was already at dessert, but other people at my table had gotten it and it looked really good.

The only dish I really couldn't eat was an alfredo shrimp pasta. It was pretty gross--I tasted mayo in it? Not a pleasant surprise. I was expecting a nice creamy cheesy sauce. 

They had good desserts too, which is usually my least favorite part of a buffet. They had actual ice cream, instead of gross frozen yogurt. There was an ice cream freezer with 8 different buckets--I gnoshed on the oreo and butter pecan ice cream happily. They also had some good cheesecake, which complemented the ice cream really well. 

All in all, I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"A very nice buffet. Had a sushi area and a Mongolian style grill in the back. Have a lot to choose from for a good price. Tried just about everything there and all was well done and tasty. I loved the selection of sushi they had and went back for more. 
The decor was open and bright and the place was clean....which puts it several steps above most buffets that are too densely packed or just plain filthy. 
Would recommend going to this place."}
{"text":"Great variety.  Great price!  Beats other buffets in the East Valley."}
{"text":"I would say the 1 stars are a little harsh. I'm not gonna lie, I like a good buffet, and the fact that this place has a lot of variety helps in the star department, period.

The seafood is average, and actually.. I wouldn't recommend the oysters. Kinda scary. The sushi and sashimi weren't super fresh, sushi-bar style, but there was a variety and the servers were always replenishing.

There was a LOT of different kinds of chicken. Chicken-on-a-stick, terikyaki chicken, bbq chicken, you name it. 

Service was good, there was always someone coming around taking away plates, refilling water. All in all it was just an average experience, because there was nothing particularly memorable OR dissatisfying."}
{"text":"The positive sides were high quality dishes overall, a very clean and comfortable environment, and attentive wait staff to refill water glasses and clear.  The down side was I had a coupon for $2 off from last year on one of their business cards as a promotion and the manager did not honor.  I drove a total of 45 miles there and back and will not return.  The $2 off got me there but the refusal was a downer feel as I walked out the door.  The dessert looked much higher quality than your typical buffet.  The egg custard and banana bread pudding were A grade.  Would like to see the crab legs.  They must only come out at dinner.  Not a lot of seafood for lunch other than shrimp, one steamed fish (looked like tilapia), and marinated mussels."}
{"text":"Great Hangover food. Honestly, I'm not a fatty but after a good night of drinking I would like to have a good meal with as much food as possible. Some of the stuff at Crazy Buffet wasn't awesome but they had enough choices and staff where you could go back and get the same thing fresh when they changed it out. Their Hot & Sour soup was good, sushi was actually really good for what you'd expect for a buffet (they had similar rolls to RA for a cheaper$), sauteed veggies and Mongolian style BBQ was great. For under $10 for a wkend lunch, totally worth it."}
{"text":"My 4 year old daughter loves seafood, so whenever we are leaving the gym, she always asks if we can stop at the Chinese buffet on the way home. I decided to be super mom and cave in to her request, but they were closed during business hours 9/14/15.

I really am not sure why my daughter asks to go there because she doesn't even really eat the food. She just has fun piling things on her plate and playing with it because nothing is ever tasty at Crazy Buffet."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Lots of variety.  6 tables of food.  There is everything from salad to chow Mein, rice, BBQ chicken, spicy chicken,  baked crab, sushi, crab legs, fruit, cookies, and Ice cream.  Very good food.  Good service.  Go for lunch."}
{"text":"I dislike when any restaurant changes recipes on something that was tasty to begin with.  They did that here with their fried shrimp.  Fried shrimp is not something you need mess with in the first place...but they messed.  Messed up.  
It now has some type of black pepper batter...and the shrimp don't taste like shrimp, but like those cheap budget packages of chicken nuggets you got from the grocery store when you were broke.  That was a huge let down, as I am known to heap fried shrimp on my plate...even after I've had enough twice over.
The Mongolian BBQ was a big let down as well.  Its very small in the corner with so few selections that I almost felt sorry for the place.  But then I realized that the owners couldn't possibly NOT know what makes a good Mongolian bbq.   I then felt like they just didn't put the care into it that they should've.
The cook was tired, and it showed.  And it wasn't clean back there like it should've been.
The last straw was the biggest straw in the history of straws....they didn't have any duck.  If I eat anything else here more than the shrimp, its the duck.  And they didn't have it on a Saturday night.  I was so disappointed.  I wanted to....to pout.
In the absence of the duck, I piled my plate high with crab legs.  Not really good.  They weren't sweet.  Way too rubbery.
I was disappointed.  But the night before, we went to New China Buffet on Southern...and it was so horrible that car tires would've tasted better.  So this is still not as bad as that place, but Crazy is getting crazy, and not the good crazy. 
I hope this was just an off night."}
{"text":"Food is awesome and fresh, but let's be serious....we come for the CRAB LEGS!!!! Always available and huge and salted and steamed just right! We still can't believe they've kept their prices down considering how much crab flows through this place. 

Sushi bar is decent, seafood selection is good....ice cream bar is a nice touch....

Bathrooms could be kept up more, but wait staff is attentive when its brought up to them....."}
{"text":"Crazy price, crazy buffet!  They have a very large selection of seafood, including nigiri sushi, sushi rolls, sashimi, baked salmon, various shellfish, including large and flavorful snow crab legs.  They are quick at refilling the stations too, even with the more expensive items like the sashimi and crab legs.  They also have a Mongolian bbq station, your standard Chinese food buffet fare, and a wide selection of fruits, including some canned Asian style fruit like lychee and longan.  Service is good and drinks and dishes are attended to regularly.  Also, in the mail there is often a 30% off total bill coupon in the Clipper coupon magazine which makes dinner (usually $12.99) an even better deal."}
{"text":"The worst buffet I've ever been to. Seafood are expired, meats are hard like rocks, cabbages are dry and unfresh.
One year before this was an ordinary buffet restaurant but now it's outside the 3 standard deviation."}
{"text":"so gross.  I was expecting something on par with Pacific Seafood buffet, as it is priced the same, and has similar praise on yelp.. 
SO GROSS.  They have a dude standing around playing with sushi, making it seem fresh, when in fact it's pre-sliced, in plastic tubs, and has been sitting around since...????  I'm doing a low-carb diet, and was expecting a wide array of edible seafood, and other meats, but there really wasn't much to choose from, which meant that I ate.. carbs.. which happens sometimes.. no big deal. BUT WTF even their fried carby things were really terrible. The crab legs were cold, and tasted like a wet bathing suit that had been balled up in a bag for 3 days. Everything sucked. 
Boo, Crazy Buffet. Boo. ALSO. desserts next to raw oysters? that just struck me as odd..."}
{"text":"Typically my family of 4 go to Hong Kong buffet on chandler blvd. and we love it there but decided to try something new. So that we can have a variety of places to choose from... Bad idea. The parking lot at crazy buffet was empty on a Saturday at dinner time . which should of been my first sign... The floors were filthy when u walk in,my shoes were sticking to the floor. That should of been my second sign... the sushi was bad bad bad. They pre make it and set it out for flies to land all over it. It should be made fresh to order as it is sushi!!!... Huge health hazard especially for the raw fish type of sushi. The crab leg meat was a tinged yellow color where it should be white.. The chicken was awful. It was a plate of mush. And to top it off the other clientele in this place was just as bad as the food. They fit right in. Stay far away... For 2 adults and 2 young kids it was $50!!! Horrible food and atmosphere that is way over priced. Yuck! I would of rather ate McDonald's over this place and I hate McDonald's ."}
{"text":"i like that they sell food by the pound. perfect for light eaters like me. the sushi by pound also makes a good snack."}
{"text":"This was a decent buffet.

I enjoy the fact that they have a mongolian style flat top, for cooking your selections, but the food came off tasting a bit bitter. Perhaps it's time to scrub the griddle.

They had a nice selection of asian-style cuisine, spanning from Japanese to Chinese, and a bit of Thai.

They had sushi. It wasn't high-grade sushi, but it's all you can eat. How can that be bad?

And really the sushi was pretty good. There was a sushi chef present, and watching him make a few loaves, he clearly knows what he's doing.

It's also a good place for families with picky eaters, as they have some selections of non-asian dishes available; pizza, fried chicken, garlic bread, deviled eggs, etc.

They had quite an extensive selection of dessert items; cake, pudding, jello, pie, fruit, and ice cream.

Service was pretty good; they kept my drink full, and removed empty plates quickly.

They have a very large dining room, and an additional large back room that would be perfect for groups.

I would go back, but not very often, as it's about a 40 minute drive from where I live.

But if I was in the area, and hungry, I'd go there."}
{"text":"This is my favorite buffet over in the east valley.  Many buffets out there either don't have a wide variety, the food isn't very good, or they didn't have sushi.  However, this one broke the mold.  They had a very wide selection of various asian as well as some \"american\" food selections.  The sushi here was varied and very tasty.  The only issue that my fiance and I really ran into was having a limited selection of sushi went we would go there sometimes after 8:30 pm.  However, if you go earlier than that, you shouldn't run into a problem.  This buffet had frozen yogurt and I would highly suggest topping it with the popping boba.  Those boba were amazing and it takes you back to being a kid and eating pop rocks when they pop in your mouth.  The staff was always very friendly and the place was very clean."}
{"text":"Mehh..

  Came in here to try their dinner buffet ($10) at around 7:30pm on a Thurs night to see it for myself.

  I would be hard pressed to say I like anything that I tried - save for the steamed fish fillets that were never refilled - and I tried most of what they laid out. The vast majority of the choices were dried out/old, the Mongolian grill seemed risky at best, and the sushi bar was unmanned the entire time and had an unappetizing array of sushi that seemed as if it had been sitting out for some time.

  A friendly employee caught me scooping around the empty tray of beef ribs and agreed to make a new batch to order. They came out within minutes, though much to my dismay there were cold spots in the meat! The beef/chicken skewers were all dried to jerky-level under the heat lamps. The scallop/crab seashells were unpalatable and I had to spit the sui mai into a napkin because it tasted funky.

  Ended up trying my best to fill up on random bits of low-quality chicken entrees between having a waiter stare emotionless at me every time I thanked him for taking a plate from my table.

  This location may have the potential for 2-3 stars on a great day but overall it could use a serious overhaul... Don't think I'll be ever coming back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I visited on Sunday, 27 Oct at noon.  We will NOT return due to the poor quality of our experience.  The plates for dinner were all cold.  The food was only warm and after placing it on a cold plate made the food cold by the time we sat down.  Once we sat down with our food and accepted the fact that we were going to be eating cold food it only got worse.  The food was all so bland and not very tasty.  We have been to many Chinese Buffet restaurants and this one is by far the worst we have been to.  This is my opinion and you are surely entitled to your own opinion.  Our cost for the meal was $32 and change.  We were in the local area for a soccer game and wanted to eat before we headed home.  I do not recommend this place.  Service was ok, nothing extra.  I tried the crab legs since we were paying full Sunday price, why not.  Even these were less than expected.  The legs were all very small which means not very much meat to enjoy.  As for the ice cream it too was old.  You could tell it had been in the freezer, uncovered, for a while.  As for a positive, the watermelon slices were great.  They had cut off the outer shell off leaving only the pure red sweet watermelon.  I did enjoy that part of the meal.  So this concludes my view of our buffet experience at Crazy Buffet.  Beware, before you pay for a good meal.  We didn't find it here."}
{"text":"So much better than their other location.    We came here on Christmas Day, so maybe that's why it seemed like there was much more food varieties and that the food was pretty fresh.   Regardless, I remember my parents taking me to the original buffet, and I was not much of a fan.  This location was cleaner, bigger, and our plates were always cleared by the time we returned from the buffet area.   No complaints here!"}
{"text":"food is terrible. well for only 7.99 its may be ok. i am just surprised based on the number of customers they have during lunch time, how can they stay in business...."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years, it's not as good as I remember and assuredly won't be back. Prime lunch time, few customers inside. Good was cooked well but seemed over cooked and few selections. Bathrooms simply NASTY and dimly lite. Many other fine dining options in this location. 

GOTTA BE KIDDIN..."}
{"text":"Chinese buffets are gross things. There's a reason they're cheap, folks. So - graded on a curve - this is one of the best. Note that I'm not saying it has great Chinese food, I'm saying by the godawful standards of cheap Chinese buffets everywhere, this is one you could actually eat at once in awhile without having your Hep A vaccination updated.

The positives:

- HUGE variety - biggest I've seen - including Cantonese dim sum, which is a rarity and a great surprise. Big sushi bar too (but no way I'm eating raw fish at a cheap Chinese buffet).

- Good turnover of customers even outside lunch/dinner hours, so the food isn't quite so dried up and gloppy relative to other buffets.

Negatives:

I left my iPhone on the table one day. I caught my mistake 15 minutes later, but upon my return not a soul had seen any trace of it even though my table had been cleared. The next day I used GPS to locate it - at a home about one mile from the restaurant. I called the manager, described the neighborhood, and asked if anyone in the restaurant lived in this neightborhood? I'd hate to involve the police, etc...  Lo and behold, within an hour it was determined that the \"cleaning company\" had found it in the bathroom, and the \"cleaners\" had now brought the phone back, and the \"cleaners\" had been duly chastised. Right...."}
{"text":"I'm fat and I know what's good. This place is good. I've been to a lot of Chinese food places and this one is near the top of my list. Not sure about these other reviewers.

Pros
Fast and friendly staff
Mongolian BBQ style grill
Wide selection of sushi (no complaints whatsoever)
They have Tabasco!!
Their is a wide variety of food on the buffet and everything I've had tasted great with the exception of two items listed below.

Cons
The cheese wontons look like they've been squished or crushed.
The duck tasted nasty but I think it's they way it's supposed to taste. 
My wife complained that there needs to be a wider selection of non seafood items, but she's dumb.
The price is kinda high but in my option it's worth it."}
{"text":"I used a 50% off coupon i got in the mail, it ended up costing me $6 for dinner. Being a big fan of Crazy Buffet Tempe, I was glad another location opened up closer to me..it has basically all the good choices, plus sushi and Mongo BBQ..but sadly NO CRABLEGS  
It was worth $6   good at refilling the bins when i was there."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have the best frog legs you will find in Arizona and the Sushi is great too. Best of all the staff is friendly and the prices are very cheap."}
{"text":"This place was good, but they have now closed down.  Their prices were way to high to keep people coming back when there where cheaper places."}
{"text":"An important life lesson was learned by us last night: never eat at an empty buffet. Also, it's time to cutoff my husband from the restaurant choices. I should have known better when we pulled up in the Ferrari of Minivans - the parking lot was relatively empty at 6pm on a weeknight. My next hint should have been the overwhelming barnyard smell upon walking in. 

Let's get to the plusses - because there aren't many and it won't take much time. Plus 1: service was great - the lady there was very friendly and quick to fill our waters. Plus 2: the place is huge and can accommodate large groups. Plus 3: the bathrooms were pretty clean and modern except for something I will highlight below. Plus 4: large selection of food... except...

Now for the minuses... First off, the place is downright filthy. Filthy, filthy, filthy!!! The floors looked like someone rebuilt a Chevy Big Block on them... years and years (decades?) of ground in dirt that had never - EVER been cleaned. Yuck. The food, while plentiful, was not very fresh, save for a few items. I tried the pepper salt blue crab and it was mushy... same with the regular crab legs and a couple of the boiled shrimp. The friend shrimp was great, however. the Chinese short ribs... I bet these are simply awesome right out of the cooker, but these ones had clearly been sitting around way too long. Same with the bourbon chicken and the chicken on a stick. A lot of hte cooked veggies were either soft and mushy or rubbery. The noodles seemed OK. My husband loved the fried chicken, but he was lucky enough to get some right after it was brought out. I had a bite and agree - it was very good fresh. A lot of the items, especially fruits and vegetables - seemed right out of a can. Disappointing. The hot butter (for seafood) was of the \"I Can't Believe It's Not\" variety. Blech!

The sushi... oh my God!! If there's ONE THING a restaurant should not put out for any length of time, it's sushi... for the love of God!!! Not sure why I tried it, but I had one bite... even the texture of the rice was enough to turn my stomach!!

The desserts - nearly everything was stale. 

Overall, disappointing, other than the service. It's too bad - a nice Chinese buffet would be an awesome thing to have close at hand."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place since I always drive by it. We walked into the restsurant and I got a huge whiff of the worst smell in your life. We immediately walked out and went to Applebee's.  The food couldn't possibly be good.  I surprised thus place hasn't been condemned by now."}
{"text":"Really gross, the food is not very good everything is sitting in about an inch of oil and is dripping with oil as well. Everything is soggy and the broccoli was brown, the sushi is hot and not fresh at all. As far as the awesome ice cream everybody is talking about? Let me tell ya. I was waiting behind this really big Hairy guy for ice cream and it's the type you scoop yourself out of this big tub, and I swear this guys Hairy arm scraped the side of the tub of ice cream. I said no thanks after seeing that I can only imagine who else's arms have touched that ice cream. Also the place is so filthy they do not clean what so ever the floors and baseboard are black the ceiling has dirt on it and I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like. Sorry crazy buffet I really am because I hope the health department takes my call seriously. 
Stay away at all costs"}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Overcrowded buffet.  Old and dingy."}
{"text":"This is a typical \"Chinese\" buffet in my view.  However, I have to say that the food was good.  The thing about the words Chinese and buffet together is that I tend to associate it with the places that I have been to in the small town in Tennessee where I once lived.  

Thank goodness this was not that.  The food here was actually good.  It was tasty.  It definitely changed my view of a \"Chinese buffet\".  Even my wife who is very picky about Chinese buffet's said the food was good."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times before and consistently liked it. This time, I am soooo bummed out about the food. We got here yesterday, 5 minutes after they opened and we were looking forward to hot, freshly made food. Was it hot and freshly made? Hmmm, not so much. The food looked good but when I took a bite, everything that should be fried was a little soggy and stale tasting. And all of the food was lukewarm, not hot. We ate some of their garlic blue crab and the shells were caked in garlic salt and brittle which concerns me. The selection is varied, looks good and there is a lot to choose from. But I don't want to walk in a just opened restaraunt and eat food that tastes like it was microwaved from the night before. Yuck."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite for me and the work buddies. 
It is under $10 bucks, and you can help yourself to a good selection of salad, fruit, Chinese and Japanese entrees. 
I usually start with a salad and work my way through California rolls to beef and broccoli or orange chicken. 
Service is OK, but it is to be expected with so many customers coming and going. This is a great place for grub, but it may put you to sleep once you get back to the office."}
{"text":"One of the reasons we like the Crazy Buffet Tempe location is because of the crab legs. We assumed this Crazy Buffet would have the crab legs as well. Nope. Big disappointment. We could have been OK with that if the rest of the buffet was excellent. Unfortunately, that was also not the case. While the inside was well-lit, and had plenty of seating, the selections were fairly meager and many of the items looked like they had been sitting there for hours, and this was a Saturday night! The food quality and selection is much better at their other location. The waitstaff were also less attentive to refilling drinks or picking up plates than at the other location. Although the location on Stapley was much closer for us, we will only be going to the Tempe Crazy Buffet in the future."}
{"text":"AWFUL TERRIBLE HORRIBLE SICKENING DISGUSTING the list goes on for what this place has become,  if they were smart they would close their doors and save the pubic from such a bad eating experience"}
{"text":"The food was probably the worst I have eaten in a long time.  It seemed to have been sitting out for a long time.  Everything was very dry.  The oysters tasted like stale mud.  I highly recommend not eating there."}
{"text":"This buffet sucks, the only thing I like is their coconut shrimp. They don't have orange chicken or General Zao's chicken, something every chinese place has. I went there for their dinner buffet. For 2 people 35 bucks, pricey for a buffet that wasn't that good.

They also have real ice cream, but I wouldn't touch it. The ice cream is in 5 gallon buckets that you scoop. Peoples arms are all in it, not very sanitary. Not to mention the ice cream scoop sits in dirty water. I can't imagine that would pass health code. This buffet should of been $15 for 2 people. I had much better Chinese buffets."}
{"text":"PROS:  
-Quick & Fast customer service
-Cheap
-Breyers Ice Cream and Soft Serve Yogurt
-Mongolian Grill

CONS:
-Smell when  you walk in
-Food sits there until gone so some of it is hard or just has a weird look from sitting there for so long.
-Meat looks funny at Mongolian Grill
-No other desert options besides the ice cream
-Flies

I was going to do 1 star but I gave it an extra one because they were so attentive when getting our beverages and clearing plates away.  I would not visit again or recommend anyone to go.

PS. for those who give it more then 2 stars you all are smoking way too much weed."}
{"text":"Honestly, pretty gross. 

The only reason I decided to eat here was getting a 50% off coupon in the mail. The meal wound up being about $6.

Even at $6, I'd rather have eaten somewhere else. I wasn't going to go near the questionalbe seafood, ie: shrimp and raw oysters. The oysters looked like rubbery bits on ice but I decided to try the shrimp because how can you f* up shrimp? Well, they didn't taste right and were rubbery. They took forever to shell. The shells kept breaking off, and honestly they smelled fishy. 

I suppose if you're only into pre-made generic, faux asian fusion/buffet sub par Americanized Chinese style grossness, have fun! This is just the place! 

Our waitress was really nice, and we tipped her well! Other than that, yuck!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Asian food buffet. 

Why?

Good:
Sushi - Sashimi, Rolls, Deep Fried Rolls, Nigiri. - Basically anything your little heart desires. The quality is good here (not great, it's a buffet after all). It's constantly being turned over, and for the price you pay, it's pretty amazing.
Crab Legs - I don't think I am the first to remark that you get ALL you can eat crab legs here. Crab Legs...all you can eat.
Dreyer's Ice Cream - Ice Cream is bomb, and here they have 8 or so flavors to try. Green Tea Ice Cream Yum!
Salad Bar - I say this because they have KimChee and Squid Salad (their version of it). Which is pretty cool. Also - try the banana cookie strawberry pudding (TRUST ME).
Mongolian Grill - It's all you can eat Mongolian Grill with choices like: Lamb, Squid, Chicken, Beef, Shrimp. 
They also have crawfish and oysters on the half shell if you're so inclined.
Beer, sake, wine is also served  : )

The Bad:
Now, Truth folks ... 

If you're craving Beef with Broccoli, or Orange Chicken - Go elsewhere. Those dishes don't look the best, and those who I dine with have never raved about them. I like their soups, green beans, mini dum sum situation...but their fried rice looked bleh, and the beef looked rubbery and subpar. 

Also bad, kinda dirty (so don't inspect things too much).

Bottom Line-

If you're going out for cheap sushi, crab legs, Non- Americanized Asian items and/or Mongolian grill,..and maybe wanna get a little buzz going on while doing so...you've found a the spot."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of buffets but my husband is so I let him drag me here one afternoon when we were both starving and needed a big meal. I was greatly impressed with the variety of food offered. I think pretty much everyone will find something they like here. 

As for the quality of the food, some items were on par with other buffets and others were slightly better. The chicken-on-stick was by far the best item I tried. There were some dishes that had been sitting out too long, which is not surprising since we came here in between the lunch and dinner hours. I did notice that they would not remove a dish and replace it with fresh food until every last piece of the item was gone which always concerns me at a buffet because foods should be replaced after a certain amount of time regardless of how much is left. 

Overall, I would not come here again. I am a quality over quantity kind of girl (usually) and so I did not think it was worth the money. I would rather pay the same amount for better food that is not all-you-can-eat. However, when I compare apples-to-apples this place is better than most buffets because of the variety offered and the ice cream."}
{"text":"Let's start out saying something nice... The Employees were very nice.

The food was not too appealing. Some of it looked like it had been sitting around awhile. They have a pretty good selection of chicken, but again, it was not fresh. I don't eat fish so I can't comment on their selection or quality. They do have sushi,

On my visit, the serving handles on some of the food trays were gross and sticky. I asked an employee if they had hand sanitizer but sorry, no English. I asked the man running the cash register and he said no, and that I could use the bathroom. Hand sanitizer should be mandatory.

When choosing how many stars to give them, I think back to some of the same kind of buffet restaurants I have been to around here and compare them. I gave them two stars and I can't imagine going back again."}
{"text":"I just had the lunch buffet and it was Excellent.  There was a SMORGASBURG of delicious food, with something for everyone in the family; and only 7$ and change.  There is others like it in Mesa but non with the price, atmosphere, and plethora of choices to eat.  GIVE IT A CHANCE!"}
