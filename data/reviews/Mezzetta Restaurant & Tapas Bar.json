{"text":"I had THE worst meal of my entire adult life at this restaurant. I am baffled that there are any positive reviews.    My boyfriend and i ordered several dishes on Sunday to take home.    None of them were edible, and I am pretty sure they were old and had been reheated in the microwave.   The vine leaves were dry and tasted rotten. The lamb was dry and tasteless. The pita was stale!!!  The kofta came in a sauce that tasted like jarred tomato sauce. The babaganouj was the only dish that was not spoilt.   We couldn't eat any of it, and I cannot believe this place is in business."}
{"text":"This place is a gem and I was lucky to find it as St. Clair & Christie is not my usual food scene.  A friend who used to live in the hood invited me and after a quick browse at the menu I obliged.  (http://www.mezzettarestaurant.com/food_menu.html)  Mezzeta is tiny, with seating for no more than 20-25 at a time.  This can make for a cozy meal if you get in, yet frustrating if you're left out in the cold and are starving!  I highly recommend visiting on a Loonie Monday or a Toonie Tuesday.  Although the place is completely packed, service is speedy.  Your servers will maintain a consistent parade of mezze dishes.    As a self-professed meat lover, I honestly enjoyed the veg dishes most.  Sultan's Stew is a must and Fantastic Falafel speaks for itself!  Skip the salads.  Leave room for everything else!  Make sure to grab a jug of lemonade.  It's made with orange blossom water, which makes it extra fragrant and delicious.  Super cheap too, at $5.  If you have room for dessert after the 20-dish tapas, enjoy the apricots and creme.  More of the orange blossom water infuses the dish.  Divine!"}
{"text":"Here is my take: 1. Food is very good. 2. It is a bit too loud and feels crowded. 3. We (4 of us) had dinner on a Monday night. The place was full with ONE WAITRESS. She was running around like a headless chicken. I asked for water three times. No luck. I had to go and get my own water. The food started coming 1 HOUR after we ordered. Be prepared to sit there for 2-3 hours.  4. We ordered 15 dishes. We never paid attention to the quantity or what was delivered while there. But, we later noticed that the kitchen forgot out order of fried eggplants. I am sure it was a mistake. Yet, still, we paid for it and never got it. This place needs a better management. You can't have 10-12 full tables and one waitress serving all."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Firstly, it's not the nicest setting - old and a bit grungy, but the food is amazing! It's also affordable. 15 tapas dishes for $60 is very reasonable - and it's a ton of food! We left very full. Everything I ate was full of bursting flavours. Spicy and just the right amount of garlic. The vegetable dishes are very fresh. I highly recommend the food - especially the hummus, pickles/olive dish, honey mustard salad & lamb skewers."}
{"text":"I came here a while back with a friend to try this place out. It had great reviews on Yelp, so we thought we'd give it a try.  The food itself was pretty good, though nothing really struck out as amazing. The portion sizes were smaller than we expected. And yes, I know tapas menu items are supposed to be small so you can try a bunch of things at once. Even so, I was expecting a portion size roughly like dim sum, or the things offered at Guu. These were about half that size.  They have a special on Monday and Tuesday, but note that it's only for dinner. If you go for lunch, you'll pay the regular tapas price (which isn't that bad).  I'd come here again if I was in the area, but it's not an absolute must-visit place."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love tapas? You get a little bit of everything for a good price, and you leave full. No complaints. Awesome space too.   Only missing a star because it's merely \"good\", there's nothing mind-blowing about this joint. But seriously, when you're this good - who cares?"}
{"text":"Terrible. My partner and I walked out. Some dishes were mediocre at best and the rest were all a disappointment.  The bread to start was stale and presentation  awful. We should have called it quits at this point but decided to persevere and frankly we wish we hadn't."}
{"text":"My favourite aspect of this place is the atmosphere. Its so warm and inviting, nice for a (first) date if you like your dates casual. The service was excellent. When my partner and I told the waitress to take away one of the plates that we didn't like, she let us pick another, and was generally really sweet. The food was a solid \"good, not great.\"  Some plates were definitely more memorable than others. I enjoyed the lamb shish and kofta (five stars on both of those), but the dips were less memorable. The dish that we didn't like was the eggplant garlic dip (we eat everything, I love eggplant and garlic, and was a bit surprised to not enjoy this), mostly because of the strength of the vinegar and the combo of mint and dill - not my thing Overall, I would probably go back on loonie Mondays or toonie Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Great little spot, you can easily miss it. They serve middle eastern/Mediterranean foods. Lots of selection. The portions are reasonable- obviously it depends on what you pair it with. For two we had 7 dishes in all. It was enough for us. The food is good. This is what tapas is supposed to be like. On Monday's it's 1.75 a dish. On Tuesday's it's 2.75 a dish. On other nights it's 3.75 per dish. All dishes are priced the same. Wed. they have Jazz nights."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, plenty of options, nice ambiance. Order the Sultan stew and the Persian Rice. This combination of cultures is what Canada and Toronto is all about. Don't forget to finish your meal with Baklava and Turkish Coffee! Definitely recommend this for a classy night out. Portions are bigger than you think."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is amazing and well priced. The service is great. Only four stars because the chairs and tables are uncomfortable. If they were more comfy I would hang out there all night! Also, maybe a \"featured\" dish of the week would be nice to spice things up for the regulars. Will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"The great thing about this place is, you can eat as much or as little as you want. The house recommends 10 dishes for two people, for $30 - or less on Loonie Mondays or Toonie Tuesdays. That generally turns out to be just the right amount for the missus and me, but if you're less hungry, you can order as few dishes as you like at $3.25 a pop.  Favourites from last night's visit: kebab fingers (more, please!), potato moussaka, beef sambousak, fried yams. Wouldn't order again: Eggplant Garlic (with, I think, whey powder, which gives it an unpleasant stale-tobacco flavour). Wish we'd ordered but didn't: Sultan's Stew.  Mezzetta is a great neighbourhood resto that's good enough to be a destination, especially on Wednesdays for jazz, and Loonie Mondays and Toonie Tuesdays, as others have pointed out. I am looking forward to our next summer weeknight visit."}
{"text":"Fun Mediterranean small plates.  Not amazing food, but very nice and a wide variety for relatively low prices."}
{"text":"Now admittedly, I haven't been here in about five years, but this place really does mezze right.  There are probably a hundred small dishes to choose from on the menu.  I was always partial to the Bourekas, but it's all there, all the Middle Eastern favorites..."}
{"text":"I took my family from out of town here for dinner last night and found the experience to be very good.  My family tends to have very pedestrian tastes and I was a little worried that tapas would be too \"out there\" for them. However once we arrived and I explained the concept of the menu (many small dishes, reasonably priced) they were all able to find multiple items that they enjoyed a great deal.  Service was prompt, the space is comfortable and warmly Mediterranean. From a cost-perspective Mezzetta is a great deal (more-so on Monday and Tuesdays when dishes are discounted). The food itself was great - wonderful flavors, fresh and served nicely.  Thanks again to Yelp for another good find. Mezzetta is definitely on my repeat list."}
{"text":"Everything is always fresh, flavourful, prepared to order. Small portions make it easy to try the whole menu over. Go on a Monday or Tuesday for discounted tapas."}
{"text":"Great spot! All of the ten dishes we ordered were damn tasty. Definitely check this place out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Love that you get to try so many different things. A lot of garlic but in a great way. I have visited the restaurant several times and ordered in 5 times. Service is great at the restaurant and the take away is awesome. Be sure to try the green beans, most amazing ever. The cucumber dip is goodness as well. Chicken cigars are a taste of heaven. Would highly recommend. Great staff, great food."}
{"text":"If you are the kind of person who loves food variety (test: when was the last time you stuck your fork into another person's plate because you didn't want to miss out?) you are going to love Mezzetta.    The menu is made up of dozens of little dishes that are cheap enough to order by the handful.  When I was there with family, my father-in-law said, \"I've always wanted to order one of everything on a menu.  I can do that here!\"  He was pretty excited.  While I would say that little on the Mezzetta menu stands out as extraordinary, it's all very good and the experience is what makes it great.  Dishes of note:  Anything with eggplant is excellent, veggie vine leaves are lemony and good - although a bit mushy, sultan's stew is terrific, roasted peppers and the green beans are divine, falafels are crispy and flavourful.  I haven't tried any of the meat dishes, but they look good on other people's tables.  Fried yams are lacking in crispness and the houmous is lacking in lemon (go for the baba gannoush instead!) but for only a few dollars a dish, you can afford to experiment.  Service is excellent.  True story: my brother-in-law and his girlfriend were there the other day and, it being Passover, couldn't eat the pita bread.  Without a word, the server whisked away the bread and replaced it with whole wheat matzah.  So kind!  Vegetarian score: 9/10.  Tons and tons of choices, you can eat your heart out and not even notice that meat items on the menu."}
{"text":"I sure enjoyed this small, hidden gem. Although I know I may be bit biased because of who I went here with, so I will try to be at least somewhat not biased. But I make no promises!   Who I am kidding? This restaurant is great. In fact, I have been recommending this Mediterranean and Tapas restaurant to close friends for years. It is cozy, on the medium/small size which actually adds to the vibe of homeyness, without ever being tacky.   Of course, the highlight is the food: Generally light, tasty, varied, healthy, well priced and although I have never gone on their Loonie and Toonie days, it really seems like I should drop by and check them out!  Personally, I am a huge fan of tapas but generally find most restaurants in Toronto warp the recipe by giving you overpriced or undersized offerings in the $7 range, and although tapas may be small in size, they are supposed to be inexpensive since half the fun comes out of tasting a varied selection. In Spain, tapas can be as inexpensive as .99 cents of a Euro and in a lot of bodegas give you selected number of them for free. I do not expect that here but at the very least, I would prefer they stick to the spirit of the dish(!) and Mezzeta does that.    Also, FYI, they now have music night, sure there is a $8 covers but really, I can't see how adding live music to your dinner experience could go wrong.   A great place for a date and also to visit with friends, it is a very amiable and malleable location which easy suits different occasions.    One of my personal favourites, specially during the Summer.  Check it out, have fund with their menu! Just do not tell too many of your friends... Let's keep the place to ourselves. ;-)"}
{"text":"I love the ability to sample all the different dishes in small portions. You feel like you get a lot, but because they are all small plates, you end up feeling full on less.  Service was excellent. Woudl highly recommend the sausage, and encourage you to try the lamb kebab."}
{"text":"A great place for dinner with friends. Nice ambiance, really friendly and efficient service and delicious food.  I loved the fact that the food came out quickly, and when it did, it was piping hot! Everything was wonderfully flavourful, crispy when it was supposed to be, and fresh fresh fresh.  I will definitely be returning (on another toonie tuesday.. or loonie monday!) to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem of the area totally worth a try for only a few bucks you can try a variety of tapas and if you come on the right night you can even enjoy some nice jazz! Mondays or Tuesdays have a promo going on, all tapas 1 or 2 bucks can remember exactly"}
{"text":"Tasty, inexpensive, and out-of-the-ordinary,  Mezzetta is a neighbourhood institution.  The food ranges from lucious to tasty, the prices are great, the service is always good, and you can satisfy vegetarians, meat-eaters, and people on weird diets at the same restaurant.        There are deals on Monday and Tuesday nights, but unless you're feeling broke, go the rest of the week when the best chef is working.    My favourites: slow shrimp, dream sausage (aptly named), Persian rice, Oriental green beans, and the best moist, cardamom-scented baklava I've ever had."}
{"text":"It took moving out of the neighbourhood after 3 years before I visited, despite friends' endorsements for the restaurant for years. My boyfriend does Meatless Monday and we had an errand to do nearby, so I suggested Mezzetta based on those endorsements & my long-time intention to visit. When we arrived we discovered that on Monday every 2nd dish up to 15 items costs $1.42 (every Tuesday Every \"mezze\" dish is $2.42, limit of 25 per party). The regular price of each food item on the menu is $3.50. Way to do Meatless Monday!  We ordered about a dozen dishes. The quality was amazing. We enjoyed all of it. Some standouts: I forgot how good falafel could be and then I had theirs. It was some of the best falafel I've had in Toronto, and among the best I've had outside Israel.  Crispy outside, soft and fluffy inside, spiced just right. The smokiness of the baba gannoush was exactly what I like in that dip. The Sultan's Stew, an \"exotic stew of sautéed and spiced eggplant, zuccini, tomato, green and red bell peppers, and onion\", made my mouth happy. The Red Goat salad (\"goat\" being the feta cheese) tasted really fresh.  My least favourite was one of the 2 meat dishes that we ordered (he bent on \"Meatless Monday\"): The moussaka.   Service: Friendly and fast. Value: Fantastic (though remember, we went on Monday when the most expensive thing we ordered was a pitcher of lemonade).  My boyfriend wants to make it our regular Monday evening destination. I can't argue with that. While I might order some meat items - some chicken or lamb shish, perhaps -  I'm happy to stick with the many vegetable offerings.  The awards and accolades bestowed upon Mezzetta by local media such as Toronto Life, Post City and Now are well deserved."}
{"text":"When I heard the idea of visiting a Mediterranean tapas place I engaged the adventure with a yeahh!! I really liked the concept of picking 10 different tapas for 36 something bucks and share.  When we arrived to the entrance, I didn't have a good feeling but they were smart enough to display newspaper notes of approval (from 2009) in the windows, so we went in.  We ordered hummus, eggplant, potato kind of empanadas, Phylos dough stuffed with spinach, shrimp, shoulder veal and lamb kebabs, salmon, some kind of red sauce we couldn't say what it was, and something else that if I can't even remember for sure wasn't worth at all.  The service lacked at lot. She didn't gave us a glass of water even when we ordered beer and wine... When the dishes came, a guy and the waitress would just smack the dishes in the glass table without explaining what was what.  But what killed every aspiration of a decent meal was the sound of the pip pip on a microwave... Like seriously they cooked it last night (hopefully) and warmed it for us with love in that thing we didn't even use for popcorn... Try to pretend your meat came from the grill and put the microwave on silence. And yes, after 2 min some dry, chewy meats kebabs were on the table... We ate them for respect to the animals.  The best part of the meal as they recognize was the hummus and the eggplant stew, or I can't tell because they wouldn't have the consideration of telling what dish was what."}
{"text":"First time here, it's an interesting idea and not bad, but was a little disappointed.   I like that they recommend how many dishes you should get for 2, 3, 4, etc people. It's also great that you can try a large number of different dishes for a very reasonable price.   The pita they provide for your table are just not very good. So many of the dishes you can get are very 'dip-in-able'... If the pitas were top shelf it would greatly raise the level of enjoyment on these dishes.   Service was pretty speedy and, as I mentioned, the prices are fair.   All in all not a bad place"}
{"text":"Love this place and frequent it. Great atmosphere, live music on Wednesdays, and awesome food. What else can one desire?"}
{"text":"I visit this restaurant at least once a year since I moved here in 2007 and it remains my very favourite in Toronto.  You read that right.  If I had to choose one top restaurant, it would be Mezzetta.  I love the concept.  There are some 50 items on the menu and something for everyone.  It is a lot of fun, especially with a small group, to talk and negotiate what you'll order.  The small plates allow you to get many tastes all in one night.  It is the ultimate restaurant for anyone with commitment issues!  The food itself is delicious.  I don't think I have tried one of the dishes that wasn't pretty tasty--and many are really good, even the basics such as the rice.  The service has always been good too; I have never had a problem with slow service or the like.  The value is fair--if you want to stuff yourself silly and spend as little as possible, this is not your place.  But if you are looking for an interesting dining experience where you won't leave hungry or with an empty wallet, this IS your place.  The place can get a little bit crowded depending on the night and time.  I would recommend a reservation.  I have not been here for the music night.  I think it used to be jazz.  They can accommodate a larger party but the ideal size is probably 4 which allows you to sample 20 of the items.  A bigger party means more items but remember that the size of the plates stay the same--hence, people might not get to try everything.  I think one of the best times to come here is \"first date\" night, meaning the first proper date after you've met somebody for coffee or a drink.  Talking about the menu items can break any remaining ice and sharing the plates helps build a bond.  Plus you can then go for a walk along St. Clair.    Most highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Decent food, nice atmosphere. The waitress was very helpful in giving suggestions. Also note they use Halal meat, which is always a bonus in my books!  Would be interesting to try this on a Wednesday night, when they have live Jazz playing."}
{"text":"My friend and I went out for dinner last weekend, and I recommended Mezzetta Restaurant, having been there several times in the past with other people. It's a little dim inside, with wooden furniture and décor, and an unusual layout in that the middle of the restaurant is raised above the front and back. Each table has a glass cover that has a variety of photos and postcards underneath. All their food is served as tapas (little appetizer-sized dishes), arriving a few at a time as they are ready. The service was not bad at first, although it was a little hard to find our server once all the food had arrived.  The usual order is 5 dishes per person, and you can select whatever you wish from the list of salads, dips, vegetables and meat/fish. I always order the Sweet Mustard salad with walnuts, and we also had the goat cheese/tomato/olive salad. One of the best choices was the Mezziki, a cucumber and dill yoghurt mixture. The vegetable choices include cauliflower, a few eggplant dishes, and cheese or spinach bourekas (stuffed puff pastries) which were also very tasty. We had the Persian Rice, made with raisins and spices, and some falafel, which were a little under-cooked. The meat dishes include various skewers (2 per dish), Kofta meat balls,  potato moussaka with minced beef, and grilled fish or shrimp. The lamb skewer and moussaka were really good, but somehow we missed ordering the shrimp as one of our 10 dishes. My friend ordered the custard for dessert, which she seemed to enjoy.  Dishes are $3.75 each, or $36 for 10, which was a good amount of food for two people. With the dessert and drinks, the total bill came to $57. My friend definitely enjoyed herself, and plans to return to try some other selections, so 2 hearty recommendations."}
{"text":"I noticed a few bad reviews but I have had nothing but great experiences when I've eaten here. During the week they have a couple specials that make the food extremely affordable, but still very good! I've gotten takeout with a few friends and it is a crowd pleaser! The dishes are small though, so don't make the mistake we did the first time and not order enough. I think it is suggested 3-5 dishes per person. The last time I went with one girlfriend we ordered 9 and it was enough with a tinny bit left over, which is always better than my having enough!"}
{"text":"Service was really great - super friendly and really attentive. We tried 10 different dishes. The best 3 were the lamb shish, the exotic green beans (I would probably have been good with ordering 4 orders of it! So delicious and well flavoured) and the cheese boureka. The baba ganoush, sultans stew, kofta, vine leaves, creamed cauliflower, smoked Sally and potato moussaka were average, I would have liked a bit more of a punch of flavour in each dish. The serving sizes are good. The recommended 5 per person is a great amount."}
{"text":"I came here on a date. A surprise my date had planned. I was skeptical due to (a) the surprise factor and (b) the type of cuisine when he started throwing hints.  It was most amusing when we arrived at 7pm (reservation) and it was empty; there was no need to make a reservation!  The service was very efficient. No complaints.  The food. I threw out my skepticism. I was expecting shwarmas but I was delightfully surprised to read the menu and discover so many tasty tapas. This is, in effect, a tapas bar.  We ordered the plate for 2, which comes with 10 tapas dishes. We had the lamb, veal and shrimp skewers, a feta and tomato and red onion salad, the hummus, and several veggie tapas, including mushrooms, green beans and carrots, and the persian rice. We had the Cameron's beer. Good choice.  This is a great restaurant to go to on a 1st date. You share food, or work together to select the dishes (as my date put it, LOL), and have a very pleasant conversation in a casual environment. To be fair, this guy chose wisely!"}
{"text":"Affordable and delicious! Doesn't look like much from the outside but it's nice inside. Great place for a casual date, for a solid meal or a small bite to eat with drinks. It's easy to portion control (given that it's all tiny plates) and control your spending. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"A great budget Mediterranean tapas place that would be one of the best in town for the price, except the fact they microwave a number of the dishes and even the pita bread!? You can ask them to not microwave some dishes, but we were told others are premade and frozen.    Go on Monday or Tuesday for the best deals and dishes around 2 dollars.  On those nights, 2  really big people can get seriously full on about 30 dollars including tax and tip."}
{"text":"Love it. Great tapa prices and you get to try so much more food too because of the size. Go with a big group if you want to try more items."}
{"text":"3.5**  Great dishes, good portions too, but expect be smacked with a good helping of garlic and dill.   4 of us ventured in and ordered away, who could really go wrong with $1.50/every other dish? They brought the dishes in a bit of a strange order with some meat dishes coming before the salads, and then 15 mins would pass and another salad would come.... This caused us to loose track a bit of what we ordered, and how much was on the way. Needless to say we got too much and were pretty stuffed, yet walked away with a small meals worth of leftovers.  We somehow spent $94 with tax and tip altogether, which was a bit of a surprise but I guess even with the discount it adds up...especially when you loose track.   I walked out feeling like I could chase away any vampire within a 5-mile radius. Also my stomach felt dense and a bit oily from the heavy use of olive oils in a lot of their dishes. I would return on a Tuesday and stick to more of the meat skewers now that I have an idea of the selection!"}
{"text":"As far as this neighborhood goes, this is your best bet for eats.  I am vegetarian, so like that there are lots of menu items to choose from. The service has been good when I have eaten there (twice) and now they really impressed me with a catering order I had.  I threw a party for 20 and my bill was around 200$. As far as price goes, you can't beat it. The order was easy to make and the owner was very good about helping me make the right number of choices for my guests. As agreed, it was fresh and ready to go when I showed up and they packed it well for our travels home on foot.  The food got many compliments and will certainly use them again!"}
{"text":"The great thing about this place is that its tapas enable you to have a meal that spans so many ingredients. I've yet to have an item that wasn't good, which speaks to the consistent quality of the food.  One thing that mystifies me about this place: what's with all the signs about touching the map?"}
{"text":"The way I review it is if you are better value for money in all criteria, then you have 5 star. If you are value for money but good - 4 stars, if you are A-OK then A-OK.  This was a solid 3.5 Star experience  5 star -nothing 4 Star -Price on Monday and Tuesday Ambiance on Wednesday- They have jazz humus hot sauce with bread vegetable stew Serving size 3 Star -Price on other days -attitude and service -Taste, cleanliness  2 star Moroccan Cigars Price 1star Sausages  We went to Mezzeta on Tuesday and will probably only go back on the special days. On Tuesdays you get all tapas for $2.50 and on Monday $1.50"}
{"text":"This was the first Mediterranean tapas restaurant that I've been to. I was a bit surprised that it was rather empty inside for a restaurant with an average rating of 4/5. What I really liked about this restaurant was that you get to sample various smaller dishes at a fair price (10 dishes between 2 people for $36 excluding desserts and drinks). It might not sound like a lot of food, but I was certainly full. I realized that other Yelpers were talking about a discount on Mondays or Tuesdays, but I went on a Sunday so I couldn't take advantage of this.  I found that most dishes had very strong flavours with lots of herbs in them, so they might not meet everyone's taste preferences. For example, I liked a more simpler salad like the Mediterranean Garden compared to the Tabouli. Personally, I was not very fond of the Baba Gannoush dip because I did not really like the smokey flame-roasted taste. The pitas were also a bit drier than I would have liked them to be. However, I really liked the meat dishes (I got the Veal Shish and Slow Shrimp) since the flavours were what I was more used to having on a regular basis. My favourite vegetable dish was the Sultan's Stew.  Overall, the service was amazing, and the food came very quickly. I recommend trying out this restaurant, but just be reminded that everyone has different preferences in terms of flavours, so some dishes could be a \"hit or miss\" depending on what you like."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place for our wedding anniversary. It was very authentic feeling and we love the concept of choosing 10 different tapas for $36 (2 people). Price was very reasonable as well.  Not all dishes were good and the naan we received in the beginning of the order were what it looked and tasted to be like store bought. They weren't fresh and most likely heated in the microwave.  The Cheese and Spinach Boureka were quite bland and very dry. The kofta with the tomato sauce didn't taste fresh and sauce tasted like it came from a can. The hummus was not the best we've had and needed much more salt. Although the Mediterranean garden salad was  fresh and flavourful. The remaining meat dishes were were quite good as well. Overall it was a great experience trying different types of foods in mini dishes. We would recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"I really really enjoyed my experience here. A true tapas style menu where the tapas are really reasonable priced and decently sized. Definitely go with friends so you can try a bunch of the dishes. They have quite a big selection enough to keep the meat eaters and veg people happy. The star for me was surprisingly a spicy mint carrot dish. I was not expecting that! The interior is a bit odd with a lot of exposed wood columns. It reminded me of a beach house or something similar."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in all of Toronto.   I love the cozy private atmosphere in this restaurant. The service is speedy, and the servers are always friendly and treat us with respect.   They offer a wide range of delicious Mediterranean dishes, and I have never had a dish I disliked. And for desert, I love to top of a wonderful dinner with passion fruit in cream."}
{"text":"A friend suggested we visit this restaurant for dinner last Saturday after having visited twice before and having enjoyed the experience. We met at 5pm - when they opened - with two other friends.   My friend had a coffee with her, and immediately the waiter (acted like an owner) wouldn't stop making a fuss over her coffee. There were no other patrons in the restaurant, and yet he kept asking her to get rid of her coffee. He did bring her a cup to put it in.   We ordered 20 plates for four people. In terms of drinks, we chose to stick to plain tap water, except for one friend who ordered a coke.   The food arrived pretty quickly, and these were our thoughts on the experience:  Food:  Bland Small portions  Service:  Had to flag down staff for water refills - everytime! And we were the only guests in the restaurant! Eventually we gave up trying to get more water.   We ordered several dips, yet had to pay extra for a second basket of pitas.   They took our menu (we had kept one in case we wanted to order more) because they were \"going to start to get busy\" and I guess they did not want us to order more food. Huh?! I thought they were in the business of selling food! Not that we would have ordered more - food was average.   They considered themselves too busy for us when two more tables were filled on a Saturday night.   In sum: bad service, average food and small portions = skip it! There are plenty of good restaurants on this St. Clair strip."}
{"text":"Great little place with delicious food and a good value for food and drinks.   We had the dinner for 2 (10 small plates) and it was so much food that we couldn't finish it!   Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the meal format was different and exciting. The chefs clearly take pride in their food and pay attention to details.   The highlights for us were the lamb and shrimp kebabs, the grilled meat on both was very tender and crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside.  The meatballs were also tasty. The baba ghanouj, it had an interesting smoky taste. We also had green beans, hummus and sultans stew which were all delicious.  The mixed greens salad was even surprisingly good with a tasty vinaigrette and chopped walnuts on top.     Four stars instead of five due to the service, which was friendly, but the 2 servers seemed inexperienced and a bit overwhelmed by the full restaurant!   Overall a delicious & enjoyable meal, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not a hipster in sight! Refreshingly old school. They take the food seriously and Wed night some great local jazz at 9 and 1015. How can you beat that for a neighbourhood night out? We felt the delish tapas was a great value. Everything we ordered was superb and obviously made with care. Everything arrived at the ideal temperature, and the textures were sublime. Garlicky lemony scratch made falafel, smokey babaghanoush, juicy kebab fingers, luscious sultans stew, etc. Have been here numerous times for the music and always impressed by the consistency of the kitchen. Plus fragrant apricots almonds and cream for dessert! Family run with pride."}
{"text":"Order all the meat on a stick you can. Shrimp, veal, chicken, and the beef balls whatever you can get your hands on. The candied yams are worth a double order. Note: Cauliflower has caraway, the cucumber is a dip not a tapas, and you don't need a second humus."}
{"text":"My official rating: 4.5 stars Toonie Tuesday upgrade: 5 stars If I was Wayne C. rating: 3.5 stars  As previously mentioned, this place is indeed a \"little gem\".   We visited tonight for the Toonie Tuesday special - each dish costs $2.42 on Tuesdays. Bill only came to $30 for 2 people, we had 10 tapas-sized dishes and a juice.   I especially enjoyed the hummus, dream sausage, Sultan's stew, crispy green beans and the eggplant dip.   We also had the beef skewers, swordfish, a salmon dish, a rice dish, and potato moussaka. All good. Rice and potato moussaka were a bit bland. Will probably give those a pass next time, because there are 30 other menu items I want to try!  Also worth noting - the service was absolutely great. We had a very friendly server, she knew the menu well, was quick and efficient.   We arrived early, around 6pm, which seemed to be a perfect time to avoid the rush. Many of the tables were reserved.  Going back to this one for sure! Thanks for the recommendation, Yelpers!"}
{"text":"So very disappointed in my 3rd visit to this restaurant. I would not have gone back if the service and food were sub-par previously and by no means have recommended it to friends but, alas that is what happened on this visit. I raved about the food so 4 of us planned dinner on a Saturday night. We were the first in after they opened at 5:00. No other customers for about an hour so you would think we would get great service and attention.  Again, disappointment. I had a McD's coffee cup with me and right away the staff wanted to dispose of it. I still had coffee in it and wanted to finish it. He brought over a coffee cup for me to use instead of the McD's cup. Now, if I was in another coffee shop I would understand his concern but this started my experience on a negative note.  We ordered our food and they started to bring out our meze to enjoy. I will give them kudos where it belongs. That's why they got 2 stars instead of 1. The food did come out quickly.  But, unfortunately the food was very bland! No spiciness although noted on the menu as spicy. Just basic, boring and again, disappointing. Don't get me wrong, we ate most of the food but for a place which is known for unique flavors and actually notes them on the menu it was very bland. Lastly, I want to touch upon the service. Again, disappointing. Asking for water refills is not that big of a deal but couple that together with the attitude of the afformentioned coffee cup, the comments about needing the menu back because they were \"busy\" (only 3 of the tables had diners). Busy? Really?  And just the feeling we never had their full or even somewhat attention.  It will be a very long time before I return or recommend to friends, family or even acquaintances."}
{"text":"Love going to UYE event and thanks for Elaine organizing that at Mezzetta Cafe Restaurant! More people More power! These are the dishes I able to have a taste of:  Sharing:  *Tahina - A rich purée of sesame seeds, parsley and garlic - nice and refrefreshing but flavours overpowered by all the other tapas we ordered!   *Houmous - puree of chick peas with tahina and lemon, and a secret blend of spices - A OK with the pita bread  *Eggplant Garlic A bold puree of flame-roasted eggplant, garlic, dill, mint, and vinegar  *Fried Yams - Crispy deep-fried yam chips, dressed with fried onion shavings - Yam! Yum! Giulana witnessed me ate the whole order by myself!  *Potatoe Sambousak -  Potato and onion puree wrapped in puff pastry, three pieces dressed with mezziki - brownish looking.. too bad those are not mini chocolate cakes.. dry and uninspiring!  *Exotic Green Beans - Crisp-fried green beans, shaved onion, dill and garlic, dressed spicy hot - not spicy hot at all! But the beans were cooked well, crunchy and fresh! My fave of the night!  *Mushrooms - Tender sautéed button mushrooms served in a garlic vinaigrette - standard, ok but not too exciting!  Not Sharing: (But I made them share with me)  *Kofta - spiced minced beef balls served in a rich tomatoe sauce - Not bad, but not really outstanding..   *Dream Sausage -  Flame-grilled beef-lamb sausage, spiced with herbed hot sauce (Stole from Tony F) MEH.. too lamby!  *Fish Shish -  Tasty, marinated marlin or swordfish, flame-grilled, 2 skewers (Stole from Giulana B) - GREAT! light and refreshing with a hint of lemon  *Lamb Shish - Savoury chunks of marinated lamb leg, flame-grilled, 2 skewers (Stole from Tony F) - Surprised that I like it! Rich flavour without lamby taste   *Vine Leaves -  Herbed minced beef and spiced Basmati rice wrapped in vine leaves and dressed with garlic yogourt and dill (Stole from Giulana) - hey I have no idea I should eat the leaves.. Chinese don't eat the leaves we used that as a wrapping!  *Chicken Shish -  Delicate, juicy marinated chicken breast, flame-grilled - A-OK, but not really memorable!  I have a really enjoyable meal... the bills come out to be $15 per person with taxes and tips. I think I don't mind going on a Toonie Tuesday as a value oriented person that will be the way to go!!  *Special thanks for Tony F and Giulana for letting me try their food.. And I hope they will still sit next to me next time when we eating out together!"}
{"text":"I heard good things about this restaurant and gave it a try.  They call themselves a middle eastern restaurant. I cook and bake many middle eastern foods. I even have traveled to many middle eastern countries and the food at Mezzetta was worse than terrible.  They seem to forget that cumin, garlic, salt, pepper, and other spices are used for middle eastern cooking. The flash green beans, which I thought was a Chinese dish was horrible. This is favorite food of our waitress.  The falafel was sticky and raw, the baba ganoush flavorless, the pita bread was served cold, the hummus was too thick and flavorless, the hot sauce was disgusting,  mistake, the stuffed phyllo with a sauce of some sort was not pyllo dough and tasteless, the Mediterranean salad was bland. Although the water was very good.    The lone waitress was condescending and not very helpful.  There are a lot of  middle eastern restaurants in the GTA and by far this is a disaster. If anyone out there knows middle eastern food stay away and if you don't stay away."}
