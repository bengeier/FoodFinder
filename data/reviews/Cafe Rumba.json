{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants that I crave if I have not been in over a week. The staff is always friendly. I love that they have a punch card. The food is fresh and delicious. I usually attend with my bestie who also loves this place. I have the chicken burrito and it comes with fresh chips and salsa that is so yummy. The price is just right. It can get busy during lunch but that is to be expected with a good place. The environment is open but they also have a nice patio area. Now I am craving it so I will have to go tomorrow. :)"}
{"text":"My roommate and I discovered this treasure on accident, but are so happy that we did. This is my favorite burrito place in AZ. I have only ordered the chicken burrito, but would eat it every day if I could live healthy off of just that. I have no reason to even try any of their other items because I am in love. So is my roomie. Cafe Rumba simply outflavors any other southwest/mexican restaurant I have tried out here, and believe me, Burrito Tuesday every week adds up to a lot of places! The roomie and I both reccomend this place to EVERYONE, though we can only speak for the chicken burrito and chips and salsa. Nevertheless, we are in love with Cafe Rumba and wish there were many around the valley."}
{"text":"Sorry folks!  Not the best value nor food.  We typically split a Chipotle bowl w/xtra meat and walk out stuffed! And never pay more that $10 bucks w/soda and all the tortillas you want! This cost us $15 w/water only and left us very unsatisfied. Blah is best description!"}
{"text":"Lifetime Burritos Consumed (LBC): 12,081  So seriously, this is the absolute freshest burrito place in the West Valley.   NOT CHIPOTLE. NOT FILIBERTOS.   Extremely flavourful HOT meat choices;  home-style tortillas, fresh and unique burro stuffing like cabbage salad; fresh-grilled green chilis, and mango salsa.    My favorite item on the menu? Macho Sauce: a fiery, spicey, smooth salsa that always make the hubby throw in the towel early, \"It blows the doors off my mouth!\"  Prices are fine considering the taste and freshness. Absolutely love 'designing' my meal to my specifications! I get it right every time."}
{"text":"Low quality meat. It taste overcooked and unsalted. I'm craving chipotle now"}
{"text":"Always fresh, always good.    Your order is made as you go through the line, the  service is good and you can not judge this place by the size of the crowd.  Sometimes it is packed  upon arrival, other times there is no problem finding a place to sit and enjoy the meal.  Again, always fresh, always good."}
{"text":"I worked at Cafe Rumba back in Mesa and I must say it was awesome. The owners are wonderful and the food is great. I would recommend everything but my absolute favorite thing is their salads. Place is clean and has a nice laid back feeling. Love this place and I'm glad they kept this going."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican food places in town! Great hot fresh food at a good price! Like spicy don't miss their habanero salsa! Es muy picante y rico! Business lunches will never be the same!!"}
{"text":"We're regulars here because Baja Mexican food is not as heavy as traditional Mexican food. They have wonder Chicken, Pork, Steak and Shrimp marinated in a  clear broth. Wonderful fresh veggies & their guacamole is delicious. Oh yeah,  and whole wheat tortillas..."}
{"text":"Got the worst food poisoning of my life from their chicken. The ER doctor that treated me told me he gets several people WEEKLY with food poisoning from their chicken. Disgusting and dirty. Don't give them business. Stick to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Can't believe the positive reviews! This place was awful. Bland watery chicken, salsa had no flavor, even the mango salsa. It just tasted like pieces of mango. The staff was neither here nor there. They seemed a little tired actually. I found it funny that the menu had descriptions but they ask you what you want as they make it. Don't waste your time here, go to Chipotle, Baja Loco, heck even Rubios. Seriously don't bother unless you like to eat soggy cardboard."}
{"text":"Pros: I had a coupon so one burrito was free, they serve coke instead of pepsi, pleasant staff  Cons: Very very bland chicken and salsa.  Have been a few times hoping for improvement but no, I think we're done going there.  Sad because I would much rather support local business over a chain."}
{"text":"Get the nachos....they're awesome...good salsa selection too"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on the suggestion of someone who raved about this place. It is essentially like a Qdoba (do they have those here?), and in my opinion, Qdoba is MUCH better. This place was, how do I say it? ew. I had a fish taco, and I didn't even finish it. Bland, watery fish. Even the mango salsa was no good. I have no desire to return here."}
{"text":"I'm looking at the other reviews for Cafe Rhumba and I can't believe we all ate at the same restaurant. We found it to be very bland and boring. There is no way this restaurant compares to Chipotle in any way. There were 4 of us and we all had something different as none of us had ever been there before. All 4 meals were tasteless. The salsa had no taste, the chicken was not seasoned, etc. We will NEVER go back again. I could eat at Chipotle weekly and was happy to have another similar restaurant. What a shock to find it to be so bad."}
{"text":"Long wait for boring Mexican-ish food on styrofoam plates.  This is a mix between chipotle (ordering system) filibertos (styrofoam plates & cups-  not Eco-friendly) and street cart food.  I had the fish tacos- not good. The fish did not have a grilled appearance or taste and was a bit mushy.  Super lame pre-shredded cheese at this spot detracts from the quality as well as gross chips & nasty tortillas.  The same day I went here I went to happy hour at crescent ballroom and had amazzzzing fish tacos for $2 each that had flaky seasoned real grilled fish not this limp frozen mush.  I didn't realized how gross it was until 5 hours later at happy hour.  I must have ordered the same thing twice in 1 day because of how forgettable my lunch was.  Side of guacamole is super small!  This stingy cheap restaurant will not see me return."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite fresh Mex spot in Phoenix. I used to go here all of the time when I lived in the North Valley. I still make it a point to stop by anytime I'm in the area.   The restaurant is set up much like Chipotle- there's an assembly line with multiple clerks working on your order. You tell them what you want, and they assemble a huge burrito for you. The only down side is you're charged for specialty items like green chiles, but it is so worth it.   My big veggie burrito costs about $7 and is perfect before an afternoon nap.   Here is my go to order-  Veggie burrito with green chiles, chipotle barbeque sauce, rice, black beans, corn, mild salsa, ranch dressing, and maybe some mango salsa if I'm feeling feisty.   Cafe Rumba is definitely worth checking out if you are near the Arrowhead area!"}
{"text":"Consistently great food and friendly service! It is set up cafe style, which is nice especially when you're looking for a quick bite to eat.  Although they have a menu posted, they ask you everything you want as you move down the cafe style line. For example, you can choose from tacos, burritos, nachos and build out your meal from there by adding items such as rice, beans, salsa, guac, sour cream, lettuce, cheese. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot.  It is relatively cheap and even cheaper with the student discount.  The mango shrimp quesadilla is really good, and I would definitely recommend it.  The restaurant is clean, which is a plus.  The server is nice, which is another plus.  So, overall, i would recommend this place definitely."}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone could hate this place!  LOVE the food!  I always get the two tacos with either chicken or pork, pineapple salsa...and mango salsa.  The mango salsa is to die for!!!  YUMMMMM!"}
{"text":"Pretty similar to Chipotle/Qdoba in terms of price and selection (maybe a little cheaper).  Went there on a lunch break and the place was packed.  As far as the food goes, let me say this:  Chipotle, you have been pwned.  Seriously.  The food here is way better.  The burritos aren't quite as big, but they taste awesome. Go for the Rumba Burrito and you can't go wrong.    Staff always seems super friendly, they tend to remember regulars."}
{"text":"Yummy!! Tried this place for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised. I walked in around 12:45pm to pick up food to go for my boyfriend and I. They were not busy and the restaurant was very clean and has a beach-like atmosphere. I was greeted immediately by the guy behind the counter and felt at ease taking my time to scan the menu. I opted for the Tropical Tacos with shredded pork and mango salsa. Party in my mouth, it was sooo good! The pork was tender, not fatty at all and flavored lightly to allow the mango salsa to stand out more. The sour cream provided a cool complimentary taste to the sweeter and textured flavor of the mango salsa and shredded pork. I ordered the Rumba Burrito with chicken, pinto beans, rice, corn, mild salsa and cheese for my boyfriend. Unfortunately, I was way too full to try his food. However, he said it was better than Chipotle as the ingredients were fresher and more flavorful than what he gets from Chipotle. Both of our meals came with chips and salsa and the cost was phenomenal for the amount of goodies received. We were both very happy with our lunch and will definitely order from Cafe Rumba again in the future!"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food. There mango and habanero salsa are fantastic. I have been coming to this place for the past two years due to its location near MWU. I would drive an hour to get this food!! Try the enchiladas and loaded quesadilla for lunch."}
{"text":"The meat and fish is spiced and flavored well. Employees were polite and smiling. Restaurant and restrooms were clean. But it ended there for us. Rice was just plain, white rice with no spices or flavor of any kind. Plus we kept biting down on hard rice that was either uncooked or really overcooked. When we asked one of the employees what their spicy pork tasted like, he said he couldn't describe it because he hadn't tasted it. We were also disappointed to see the fish kept in a warming pan; we were really curious as to how long that fish had been just sitting in there. Reminds us of yet another \"Mexican\" chain restaurant that isn't anything special. You can get better Mexican food from the food trucks that are out in parking lots at night."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining here. I bought three salads to go and served them at a family event. The salads were a hit!  I plan to return for a 2nd experience when the area again."}
{"text":"Good food, I have been going here since it first opened. Recently they have been starting to charge for little things they hadn't before... I paid 50 cents for my salsa for my chips. This is a Mexican food joint most have salsa bars... I don't want to be charged 50 cents for 1 side of salsa for my chips."}
{"text":"Good food made by good people. Try the shrimp mango quesadilla or the bbq chicken pizza they are delicious."}
{"text":"Beef rumba salad is light, refreshing and somewhat healthy. Dressing optional as it's so tasty with salsa only. Oh! and don't forget to squeeze lime on it. Flavors are great, serving size is a bit small for the price paid. Seems a small salad like this one shouldn't be close to $7.00, I'd think more around $5.00.  Ambience is sort of beachy if you use your imagination."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Friendly employees. Great ice tea! So happy I found a good place to get a delicious burrito. This place blows chipotle out of the water. Lunch deal is great- burrito, chips and salsa, cinnamon crisps and a drink for $6.99"}
{"text":"Did I just pay $10.43 for that?! The soda is good. They barely give you cheese or sour cream on your burro."}
{"text":"My wife wanted to try Cafe Rumba again so off we went along with our friend Kathy R. Kathy got the shredded beef burrito. She told Carol & I the place reminded her of Chipotle only better. My wife Carol got the pork burrito beans, cheese and sour cream. I ended up getting the same dinner as she did. The burrito was served with chips and mango salsa and a drink.   I must admit I enjoyed it much better than the beef we had there on our first visit. In fact that is why I gave it a higher rating than on my last visit.   I didn't realize they also had a selection of several different kinds of salsa. So I tried the pineapple salsa and two others. They really added to the over all flavor of the food.   FOOD: Very fulfilling - fast and efficient. The three questions I ask myself after a meal... a) Am I full?  check`b) Did the food taste good? check c) Was it worth the price I paid? check PRICE: The prices were good for what you got! The three questions I ask myself after a meal...a) Am I full?  check b) Did the food taste good? check c) Was it worth the price I paid? check. Another nice thing is that when you dine in they have complimentary chips to accompany your meal. SERVICE: Staff was nice, and the service was up to par AMBIENCE: Looks pretty much like a typical fast food restaurant. CONCLUSION: Their portions are always large so you really get your money's worth."}
{"text":"After my great massage @ Vita Bella, I asked where a great place to eat was. I was directed to Cafe Rumba and told to get the nachos! Yum!! I like the hot green sauce with mine. Now every time I get my massage I hop over to Cafe Rumba for my nachos! Life is good!"}
{"text":"I've had the chicken tacos twice now and each time has been excellent. Nice white meat chicken, but the meat is really moist. Chips are very thin and crispy and salsa seems like they make it fresh every day.   Just a tip, they are not open on Sundays, but I wish they were."}
{"text":"I literally eat here around once a week. It's clean, fresh, affordable and delicious. And NOT a chain restaurant. Everything I want in a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Everything here is fresh and tasty! I am here weekly. Try it once and you will be hooked."}
{"text":"Cafe Rumba is a lunch staple if you work at Honeywell, go to Midwestern, or otherwise work nearby -- it's usually filled with these kinds of locals. Fair price, good portions. I wouldn't go out of the way from some other side of town to eat here, but I find myself getting lunch here with coworkers at least a couple times a week. The nachos are a solid choice, and they've got a pretty nice salsa selection (I'm a fan of the mango salsa in particular)."}
{"text":"Better than Chipotle! My family and my friends have been frequenting this little walk-in, build, grab and go Mexican restaurant for years. Much like Chipotle, they give you options on the wall when you walk in, such as; \"Burrito, Quesadilla, Salad, ect...\" You pick your meats, toppings and condiments. If you get the combo you get chips, salsa, a drink, and these delish cinnamon and sugar chips! And at a very low price. Pretty much you get all of that for what you would get for just a burrito at Chipotle. I think the quality of everything from the meats, to the lettuce and salsas, are better then Chipotle as well. Its also not a chain. I love that! So save your money and come here instead!!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rumba has become our family's go-to quick dinner option.  The baja mexican menu features great fresh tacos, enchiladas, burritos and salads, cooked right in front of you and customized with various fresh toppings.  My favorite is the pineapple salsa. The menu tops out at $7.99, and you can usually find a coupon, so the whole family can eat for a reasonable price.  There's a quesadilla kids meal too!  Mix in an inexpensive margarita for dad, and the whole family leaves happy every time."}
{"text":"Definitely my preferred quick Mexican food place! Obsessed! I love this place! The shredded beef burrito is filling and delicious! The fresh salsa is amazing! The only bad thing is they aren't open on Sundays and that's usually when I want it!! :)"}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place a couple months back after running some lunchtime errands, and was soon coming back with reinforcements....  It reminds me of a cross between Chipotle and Bajio, The overall presentation seems a little more authentic, if that makes sense.  The small burrito lunch special is a good deal, but I have grown to love the (slightly more expensive) Tropical tacos.  The mango salsa is addicting, and the excess that falls off can always be scooped up with the included chips.    On that note, of variety of meals we got (burritos, tacos, quesadillas) they all seems to fall apart at some point.  Not a huge deal, your burrito just becomes sort of a rice bowl halfway through.  Make sure you grab a few extra napkins!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's similar to Chipotle, but your food is being cooked right in front of you as you go down the line, not just assembled.  The chips and salsa are great, they have horchata in addition to soda and beer, and the shrimp mango quesadilla is amazing!  They've got some good salad and dessert options too.  I just wish they were open on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food. Friendliness of staff is hit or miss."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fast service, and tasty food. Cafe Rumba is a great place to get a quick bite to-go but they have spacious seating if you are looking for a sit-down meal.   You order at the counter and pay before sitting down. I usually order the Rumba Burrito with carne asada, black beans, rice, cheese, lettuce, guacamole, and mango salsa. And it comes with chips and salsa to provide a very filing lunch.   What I recommend: - Rumba Burrito with mango salsa - remember to get your card stamped"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! My favorite is the Rumba Nacho's and my Husband loves the Rumba Burrito. Always fresh and made right in front of you. Don't understand the negative reviews. They have a great menu and lots to choose from. Just wish they didn't take the fried ice cream off the menu! 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Amazing salsas! I love the habanero, the pineapple, and the fresh mango salsa! The sweet pork is pretty good and the burritos are good sized. I will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"I really adore this place mostly for their lunch special, and their guac is a particular favorite of mine since it's how my mom always makes it =) Their portions are always large so you really get your money's worth.  Sometimes the food can be a little bland, but I feel like that's more a failing on my part for not putting the right salsa on whatever I'm getting.  Their sweet green salsa and mango salsa are particular favorites of mine, and I'm happy to keep going back to a local business."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a fair price and far better than the chains of the same vein. A nice family owned business welcomed in a growing neighborhood. Perfect if you're across the street at Honeywell or Midwestern U, but easy to get to since it's a mile south of the north valley 101. Get a Rumba Burrito with pork, your choice of fixings and hot green salsa. You won't regret it. You can even grab a cold beer to wash it down."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for carry outs! We absolutely love their tropical salad with mango salsa !!!! The quesadillas are awesome as well. Everything is made right in front of you. The staff is friendly and helpful with questions if you are not sure what to order. We have seen Glendale Police officers eating here as well! We love this place!!"}
{"text":"Cute interior, nice staff, decent enough menu and prices. The food lacks character, it's good, don't get me wrong, I just expected something edgier... spicier, perhaps. I think if the chef took a step back and considered the demographic things would improve."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't get it. Over priced and kind of bland. Also, I ordered the Rumba Salad and some of the lettuce was brown. I really do not understand the high reviews for this place, this is not Mexican food."}
{"text":"Baja Quesdilla is the way to go! I normally add black beans to it but I have also had it with their chicken. Delicious either way!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rumba is the best Mexican food place in town! Their meat is to die for along with their chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Absolute best nachos ever. The tortillas they use are also very good, tastes like my aunt's homemade! They also offer mango salsa, everything was delicious.   The staff was courteous and the meals were reasonably priced. I'd definitely visit again, this isn't your local Filiberto's!   I wish everyone would stop comparing them to Chipotle. This is Baja Mexican, and Chipotle is Americanized Mexican food. Two different things, that's like comparing Kansas City BBQ to Memphis BBQ, both good, but different."}
{"text":"Great food! Always a great place to stop for a quick bite. My kids love the cinnamon chips that come with their meal. I love getting their burrito with a large iced tea! Yum!"}
{"text":"Everything is fresh and delicious! Try the mango or pineapple salsa it is amazing! The horchata is also good. You can add or take out what you want. Their chicken also is marinated and has such a tasty flavor."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not super amazing. My cafe rumba burrito was okay, line was moving a little slow but the employees were nice."}
{"text":"you have GOT to try this place!!   hands down the best mango salsa of your LIFE!!   i always get the tropical pork tacos, flour tortilla, with mango salsa, lettuce, cilantro, and baja sauce.  seriously, a fiesta in your mouth.   chips and salsa come on the side, but they aren't that great and often way to salty.   regardless, i still eat here about 1-2 times a week!!   They are a bit pricey but it's definitely worth it.  as a med student at Midwestern University up the street, it's the place to go for lunch, and they give a student discount (just what i'm looking for!!).   I'm not a huge fan of their burritos, but they are about as big as your head and super filling.  my complaint is that they are watery and often fall apart, but the taste is phenomenal!  I've tried all of the meats on selection there and the pork is by far the best!   however, all of them are good and taste extremely fresh and succulent.   seriously eat here and you won't regret it, it's unique and unlike any other burrito shop you'll find in west valley/glendale."}
{"text":"Always a favorite for my wife and I! Big burritos and quesadillas and the salsas are phenomenal! We truly enjoy them and the prices are very reasonable! They put Chipotle to shame! Try them out!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rumba/Bajio/Chipotle/ etc  They are all about the same type of place. Menu on the wall, lunch counter style ordering, throw everything in a burrito.   I have to say it was good. I had the small burrito with shredded beef, chipolte bbq sauce, beans, cheese and sour cream. Served with chips and salsa and little cinnamon frys and  a drink.   The burrito was big enough without being too big, had good flavor and the tortilla was fresh tasting. The chips were salty and the salsa was glorified tomato sauce. LOL I guess I could have asked for a hotter one.   The place was clean and the staff was nice. I have a BOGO coupon from the entertainment book. I will be sure to use it."}
{"text":"Great price and very nice for a quick bite! Chips, salsa, quesadillas, and burritos are delicious. Small atmosphere but clean."}
{"text":"Been coming here forever. Enchiladas plate is amazing and their pinapple salsa is bomb!"}
{"text":"Good for a quick and easy meal.  It's a lot like Chipotle.  Although it's pretty good, I still think Chipotle is better.  The service was great."}
{"text":"Me & all my friends and family love this place! We are locals and come here often. One of my favorite local mom and pop type restaurants, and the mango salsa is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great tacos! I love that they have black beans..... My fav! The mango salsa is very good too!! The place is clean and the staffs is very nice. I like that you get to watch them make your tacos. Best time I'll try a burrito!! Yum! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Not really impressed.  I spent nearly $10 for two tacos, rice beans and a drink.  The tacos were okay, kind of bland actually.  For the money I feel like I could do better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Most of the staff have been working at CR for years which is a reflection of their passion and dedication to the company and food. Because the staff know what they're doing, the food is extremely high quality, consistent, and authentic. The staff is friendly as well and works to get the line down as quickly as possible without sacrificing quality or presentation of the food.   The environment of the restaurant is unique and comfortable with high ceilings and bright colors. Indoor and outdoor seating is available.  The food brings an authentic baja style taste. The enchiladas are my personal favorite by far. Corn tortillas, cheese, one or one of each of their delicious meats, red or green sauce, rice, and refried or black beans. I always add green chilies on top for a little extra kick and a little extra $. I also add sour cream and fresh green onions with a side of their delicious baja sauce and either their mild or hot salsa. All of the other menu items are delicious, fresh, and authentic as well. Thanks CR!   Overall, CR is an extremely authentic, consistent, and delicious local restaurant that is well worth the price. Ask for a stamp card!  A friendly note: if you want Chipotle, go to Chipotle. If you want local, go to Cafe Rumba!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Everything is fresh and deliciously good!   I usually have the Rumba Salad with chicken. It's always so refreshing.   My wife will get the daily special which is a good amount between the items.   I want to try other items on the menu but I continually go back to the Rumba Salad!   And their churros are screamin'! Whenever we're in the area we make it point to come here."}
{"text":"A very nice surprise. My parents gave me a coupon from an entertainment book to try this place and was amazed at how good the food was. I probably would have never stop in if it wasnt for the coupon but glad I did. I had a Chicken burrito and it was great. Thanks Rumba we will be back"}
{"text":"This is the best bang for your buck in the valley.   I recommend getting the Rumba burrito with shredded beef, green chilies, black beans, lettuce, cabbage and spicy green salsa.  The owners and staff are very friendly.  Similar to Chipotle but their meat is much better and so is there salsa."}
{"text":"I love the bean and cheese burritos here (I add corn and pico inside), it's around $4. The majority of their food runs around $7-8. Their tortillas here are just so good, they are seriously to die for.  If they sold their tortillas by the bulk I'd buy them. I personally don't really like the meat burritos, the plain bean and cheese is definitely the best (that's the only thing my entire family gets). My mom enjoys their fish tacos though. I used to come one to two times a week, but unfortunately I don't live close to here anymore and have to take special trips just to grab one of their burritos. You should open a location in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here had the Rumba burrito, food didn't have much flavor chips were not very good.  Salsa was bland. You can get much better elsewhere. One server really didn't want to be there was complaining about being told to wash the door, didn't make for a good experience. We wont be back."}
{"text":"I got the Nachos and the chips were stale, the meat was also very very dry that was on it. Staff acted like they were to busy to acknowledge that you are even there when in reality they were not. Definitely will never go back, if I ever feel like this type of food I'll definitely choose a cheaper tastier option such as chipotle."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim after getting a whiff of what can only be described as pure deliciousness. Not only was the food a pleasure to the taste buds, but the portions were more than generous. They have a mango salsa that is to die for and don't get me started on the tamatillo ranch, divine!"}
{"text":"Good Food. I have been meaning to try this place and I can say that I am not disappointed. I ordered the veggie burrito. Very delicious. The chips and salsa where also good. It reminded me of a cross between Bajio and Chipotle. Prices are comparable. Will go again!"}
{"text":"I need tacos in my life and Cafe Rumba fills that need and makes me happy.  The meats are marinated nicely, the salsas are light and fresh, the barbecue sauce I get on chicken and pork tacos are divine.  They have an awesome lunch special too.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been a big fan of Cafe Rhumba since my first visit. This is a great example of a restaurant with a somewhat limited menu - but consistent taste and quality across the board. I've tried a variety of different items and have never been disappointed.   If you are a newbie, here are three suggestions to start:  1. The Rhumba Burrito:  Can't go wrong here. It's the signature pork, chicken or steak on a flour tortilla where you choose the fixin's. The pork is a personal favorite, it's always moist (unlike a lot of those other burrito places) and flavorful. The ingredients are fresh and served just the way  you like them. Be sure to try the tomatillo salsa. If you're looking for something different, ask for a side of \"Baja Sauce\" a ranchy-style light jalepeno dressing for a little kick. It's not football-sized but it's pretty big and filling for most.   2. The Rhumba BBQ Chicken Pizza: Unless you have a big appetite, this pizza serves two. It's basically two cheese crisps, filled with fresh shredded chicken, onions, cilantro and tomatoes and a rich and spicy Chipotle BBQ sauce. It's just a little spicy without being overpowering. Great flavors all around. Just like regular pizza, it also tastes great the next day, so if you can't finish it, just take it home!  3. The Rhumba Salad: A fresh flour tortilla holds a bed of fresh greens and your choice of pork, chicken or beef. I usually add rice, corn, pico along with the cheese and tortilla strips. For dressing, I like the roasted tomatillo to really bring out the flavor of the meat without overpowering it. Plus, when you're done, you can eat the bowl. Well, you can eat the fresh tortilla anyway. It's a big salad but you'll be surprised at how fast you devour it. I am not a salad guy by any means but I love this salad - and I can eat a little more than usual because it's pretty healthy.   Alcohol is available or you can go with an assortment of bottled or fountain drinks.   For us, the service is always great, with a little interaction with the staff who is creating your meal to order. The atmosphere isn't fancy but it is definitely family friendly, so feel free to bring the kids. If it's cool, grab a bite on the outdoor patio or dine inside. Your call.   It's not really fast food but like the saying goes, more \"good food served quickly\". I think another reviewer's description of something between Chipotle and Bajio is right on. If you're thinking of giving Cafe Rhumba a try, go for lunch and get the lunch special - usually a small Rhumba burrito, drink and \"rhumba fries\" which are deep fried tortilla crisps coated in cinnamon sugar. It's a nice sized meal to get you through the day without needing a nap afterward. And the combo price is always nice.  If you're tired of chains and looking for a place that serves fresh food daily in a few flavorful combinations, visit Cafe Rhumba. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favoirte mexican food spots in glendale. You literally cant beat their lunch special a huge burrito, a drink and chips/salsa plus the cinnamon crisp chips for 6.99. The place is always clean, and the staff is always nice.  TRY IT OUT!!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, reasonable prices. Love the baja tacos with shrimp and mango salsa, and the barbecue chicken quesadilla."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!! The food is always phenomenal and it's such an easy place to grab lunch or dinner to take home.  The cooks are always SUPER friendly and nice, but have always gotten attitude from the cashiers. Also, we won't be ordering over the phone anymore because something is always wrong or missing. But if you order there and ignore the snippy cashiers, this place is seriouslu amazing and you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My favorite dish is chicken nachos.  They make them with all of my favorite fresh ingredients.  I really like the baja sauce and the mango salsa.  Just know this place is not own in Sundays."}
{"text":"I really like Cafe Rumba. The lunch special Rumba Burrito, Drink and Rumba Fries is a good value. I love the the Peach-Mango Salsa and the spicy sour cream.  They do tend to close early at night so I usually go there for a late lunch. They are too busy at lunch time so I just go later.  What happened to the discount coupons in the Super Savings Magazine? I miss using those coupons! I do appreciate having the punch card for customer loyalty where your 10th item is free!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was delicious! Got the tropical chicken tacos and the mango salsa was the BEST mango salso I've ever had!!! I'll definitely be back. Margaritas are $3.50 which isnt bas either!"}
{"text":"The food is so, so good!!! This will definitely become a regular place of mine. Can't wait to come back, I highly recommend Cafe Rumba!"}
{"text":"The guy who mans the grill every time we go in is so friendly, always smiling, and just so welcoming. The food is amazing! They have a great loaded quesadilla, rumba salad, and barbecue chicken pizza. Their meat is perfect! It's always clean and the service from the guy who who is always working the grill is so awesome, he needs a raise! We eat here a few times a week because the cleanliness, great good, and friendliness is consistent."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! The food is delicious. The service is friendly and helpful. The prices are competitive. I love the family feeling I get whenever I visit."}
{"text":"This place was a wannabe, lower quality, Chipotle restaurant.  Lower quality, meats NOT made to order, too pricey for the quality.  I ordered the fish tacos and when they went to put the fish inside the tacos I noticed that the food was NOT made to order. My fish was in a warming container- as was all the meat. Ew! I was worried that my fish was hours old and I'd get food poisoning.   $$$ I thought the price was too high for the quality. If I'm going to spend $15 and only drink water the food needs to be better quality.    The positive: they had several kinds of unique salsa (mango salsa was good).   Skip it-- go to Chipolte, Baja Fresh or Rubios."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food from this place.  As people have mentioned, it is kind of a standard walk through burrito joint..  Food was fresh and tasty.  Very filling..  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Just moved near hear and had not heard of them. Quite honestly, the best walk up/ take out Mexican food I have had. Taste line home cooking and fresh.. If you go here, you will never go to Chipotle again I promise.  Very reasonable prices, great staff."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites in Phoenix! Not particularly \"authentic\" as far as Mexican food is concerned but they use high quality ingredients and have lots of options. It's similar in ordering style to Chipotle but the food is more closely related to a place like Rubio's. My favorite is the Chicken Quesadilla with green chiles. Friendly staff, clean place, VERY fair prices."}
{"text":"The food is good enough, but the prices are high for the amount of food received. I can go to a good Mexican food restaurant during lunch that employs a lot more employees and has a huge building to pay on and maintain (much more overhead) and get similar prices, more food AND chips and salsa, and get waited on too.   I don't like that their menu prices online are different than the prices when you arrive. Not good business. I expect to pay the price I see online when I arrive on the SAME DAY, not more!  If the prices were less, I would probably return. Spending almost $20 for four tacos (two tacos per adult with a very small portion of rice and beans) with water as drinks and a kid's meal is way too much for the experience!!"}
{"text":"A bit hard to find since its tucked behind chase. But the food was phenomenal!!! We had the quesadilla pizza and enjoyed every bite!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at Café Rumba's for months.  Although we really enjoy the food, I realized after I got home and looked at our receipt that we were charged $7.96 for 4 salsas.  That is like charging for ketchup when you order French fries.  We ordered 4 separate entrees and ate our lunch in the restaurant.  The little cups couldn't have held more than 2 ounces and were not filled to the top.  In addition, they never told us that the salsa would cost us extra and we never have been charged before.  If this is their new policy, we will have to change our go to spot for Mexican Food!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is a small mom-and-pop place that is delicious. I get the spicy and sweet pork tacos. Delicious. Their hot sauce is also very good. I judge Mexican places based on their hot sauces, and this is a very good one. They are a bit tight with it though! I would like more chips and salsa but I understand keeping their portions controlled. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite healthy mexican restaurants.  I love it as much as Chipotle.    I try to eat healthy, and Cafe Rumba's tropical salad is one of the healthiest and yet delicious items on the menu.    They do get busy during lunch due to folks from the university and Honeywell, and sometimes in the evenings there can be long lines as well.    I try to go there to eat once per week, since the food is so healthy and delicious, and of course affordable."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites. I used to live just down the street from Rumba and would go at least once a week. Then I moved to surprise and still made the drive over pretty often. Now I'm in the east valley and make it a point to stop by rumba anytime I'm in the area. It's that good. The BBQ chicken quesadilla is my go-to choice. The chips are deliciously thin and crispy, and the Baja sauce is delectable. It's a pretty unique place with some great food, uplifting Baja style atmosphere, and great staff."}

{"text":"I got the quesadilla with shrimp and mango. Unique combination, but nonetheless good. Try it.  I'd recommend this place. I was only in Glendale for one day because I was interviewing at Midwestern University. I just decided to stop somewhere for dinner the night before the interview. I saw this place and hoped it was good--and it was.  I kinda wanted to try a regular burrito but someone else on Yelp said to try the Shrimp+Mango Quesadilla, so that's what I did.  The place was kinda empty during dinner time... I don't really know what that means, but it doesn't seem good."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of small cafe/mexican food places like this including Chipotle, Qdoba, Baja Fresh and other small hole-in-the-wall places.  This is one of my favorites because they have some of the most tender meats that they pull/shred there in front of you.  I love the location there on corner of 59th & Union Hills.  Very convenient!"}
{"text":"Great shrimp tacos, the salsa was fresh and refreshing!"}
{"text":"I always come to get their lunch special which is a good deal. Its less than $8 for the meal and drink. I highly recommend their sweet pork and the house made tortilla chips and salsa are delicious! They get the food out quick and have very good customer service."}
{"text":"Café Rumba was one of my regular lunch spots until my office moved to Peoria, I do miss eating here.  It's tucked back in the corner of the lot which can make it difficult to find, but it appears that many of the locals have found it.   The food is fresh and prepared right in front of you ala Chipotle, but tastier than Chipotle.  They have several types of salsa which compliment the light and crispy chips nicely. My favorites were the chicken burrito, fish tacos (darn good with the white sauce on them), and the quesadilla with green chilies.   The staff is friendly and helpful, it is as if they enjoy working there, imagine that.  I hope this place makes it."}
{"text":"Love love this place. The mango salsa is amazing. I love that you see them make it right in front of you. Friendly people and great atmosphere. Rumba burritos are the best!"}
{"text":"Good choice for fresh good food . Nice atmosphere  . Friendly employees  CLEAN !!!  Would most certainly  come back."}
{"text":"Closed Sundays, and seem to close early at night.  Located on the NW corner of Union Hills & 59th ave..  Food is prepared like Subway, right in front of you, but it can be challenging because the person who starts the line doesn't always speak English.  They're fine if you just say the order terminology and step aside but if you ask a question then they have to get somene else.  For no apparent reason the middle-aged overweight guy who takes the money was rude to me for asking a simple question.  This is retail, and I'm sorry you work the register, but there was no reason to be rude.  Food was comparable to other fast food places like Chipotle that are a notch up from taco bell and such.  Prices are a little high but the portion is large, and it comes with a side of those little churro-like straws.  Competition down the road makes this a tough option - Dos Amigos, Rubios, and more.  Seems to be a favorite of folks wearing scrubs!"}
{"text":"We live less than a mile away, and for 9 years, we never dined here until last week for a going-away lunch. Very impressed with the made-to-order burritos and taco salads. We had the Rumba Burrito. Tasted great. Friendly staff. We will return for sure!"}
